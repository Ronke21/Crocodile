<text>Headquarters (commonly referred to as HQ) denotes the location where most or all of the important functions of an organization are coordinated. In the United States, the corporate headquarters represents the entity at the center or the top of a corporation taking full responsibility for managing all business activities. In the United Kingdom, the term head [[office]] (or HO) is most commonly used for the headquarters of large corporations. The intended benefit of headquarters is to carry out purposeful regulatory capacity. The term is also used regarding military organizations.

==Corporate==


A headquarters is the entity at the top of a corporation that takes full responsibility for the overall success of the corporation, and ensures corporate governance. The corporate headquarters is a key element of a corporate structure and covers different corporate functions including strategic planning, corporate communications, tax, legal operations, marketing, finance, human resources, information technology, and procurement. This entity includes the chief executive officer (CEO) as a key person and their support staff such as the CEO office and other CEO-related functions; the &quot;corporate policy making&quot; functions, including all corporate functions necessary to steer the firm by defining and establishing corporate policies; the corporate services encompassing activities that combine or consolidate certain enterprise-wide needed support services, provided based upon specialized knowledge, best practices, and technology to serve internal (and sometimes external) customers and business partners; and the bidirectional interface between corporate headquarters and business units.

===Business unit===
A headquarters normally includes the leader of a business unit and their staff, as well as all functions to manage the business unit and operational activities. The head of the business unit is responsible for overall result of the business unit.

===Regional===
A headquarters sometimes functions at the top of a regional unit, including all activities of the various business units, taking full responsibility for overall profitability and success of this regional unit.

==Military==
Military headquarters take many forms, depending on the size and nature of the unit or formation they command. Typically, they are split into the forward, main and rear components, both within NATO nations, and those following the organization and doctrine of the former Soviet Union (see Isby, 1988).

The forward or tactical headquarters, known as &quot;tac&quot; for short, is a small group of staff and communicators. Usually very mobile, they exist to allow the commander to go forward in an operation, and command the key parts of it from a position where they can see the ground and influence their immediate subordinates.

The main HQs (known as &#x27;main&#x27;) is less mobile and is involved in both the planning and execution of operations. There are a number of staff assembled here from various staff branches to advise the commander, and to control the various aspects of planning and the conduct of discrete operations. A main HQ for a large formation will have a chief of staff (CoS) who coordinates the staff effort; in a smaller HQ this may be done by the second-in-command.

The rear or logistic headquarters is some distance from the battle or front line in conventional operations. Its function is to ensure the logistical support to front line troops, which it does by organizing the delivery of combat supplies, materiel and equipment to where they are needed, and by organizing services such as combat medicine, equipment recovery, and repair.

==Religious==

The headquarters of the Catholic Church is Vatican City. The World Headquarters of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses is relocated in Warwick, New York, from its former location, Brooklyn, New York. The headquarters of the Russian Orthodox Church is in Danilov Monastery, Moscow. The World Council of Churches, including Orthodox Churches, has its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. The headquarters of Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople is located in Istanbul, Turkey. The headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is located in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Anglican Communion Office is in London.

==Martial arts==

In Japanese budō martial arts such as karate, judo, aikido, kendo, etc., there is usually a headquarters for each organization or region. The Japanese word is generally used for that, also outside Japan. Sometimes they refer to these headquarters as &quot;honbu dojo&quot; (本部道場) in which dojo (道場) is a facility provided for practicing discipline, the training ground. Sometimes &quot;honbu&quot; is written as &quot;hombu&quot;, the way it is pronounced, but the Hepburn transcription is &quot;honbu&quot; in which the &#x27;n&#x27; is a syllabic n.

<text>A death erection, angel lust, rigor erectus, or terminal erection is a post-mortem erection, technically a priapism, observed in the corpses of men who have been executed, particularly by hanging.

==Overview==

The phenomenon has been attributed to pressure on the cerebellum created by the noose. Spinal cord injuries are known to be associated with priapism. Injuries to the cerebellum or spinal cord are often associated with priapism in living patients.

Death by hanging, whether an execution or a suicide, has been observed to affect the genitals of both men and women. In women, the labia and clitoris may become engorged and there may be a discharge of blood from the vagina while in men, &quot;a more or less complete state of erection of the penis, with discharge of urine, mucus or prostatic fluid is a frequent occurrence ... present for one in three cases.&quot; Other causes of death may also result in these effects, including fatal gunshots to the head, damage to major blood vessels, and violent death by poisoning. A postmortem priapism is an indicator that death was likely swift and violent.

==In popular culture==
* In &quot;The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion&quot;, art historian and critic Leo Steinberg alleges that a number of Renaissance era artists depicted Jesus Christ with an emphasis on his genitalia — including after the crucifixion with a post-mortem erection — a motif which Steinberg named &quot;ostentatio genitalium&quot;. The artwork was suppressed by the Roman Catholic Church for several centuries.
* The &quot;Cyclops&quot; section of James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; makes multiple uses of the terminal erection as a motif.
* In &quot;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, Edward Gibbon relates an anecdote attributed to Abulfeda that Ali, on the death of Muhammad, exclaimed, (O prophet, thy penis is erect unto the sky). This understanding of the anecdote, however, is based on a mistranslation of the Arabic source by John Gagnier, who translated Abulfeda&#x27;s &quot;Life of Muhammad&quot; into Latin. The English translation of the Arabic source should read: &quot;In one account, ʿAlī, may God be best pleased with him, was called upon, while he was washing him [the Prophet], to raise his gaze to the sky.&quot;
* This phenomenon is a recurring theme in the writing of William S. Burroughs, appearing in many of his books including &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; and &quot;Cities of the Red Night&quot;.
* The Apple TV+ series &quot;Bad Sisters&quot; opens with one of the characters experiencing this while lying in his coffin shortly before his wake, while his wife desperately attempts to cover it up before guests arrive.
* In the HBO series In Treatment a patient, Alex, talks about having a near death experience where he felt scared to have an erection since it would mean he was actually dead.
* The play Waiting for Godot includes a conversation between the two main characters, Vladamir and Estragon, where they contemplate suicide by hanging. Ultimately, they decide against it because they will get an erection.
* In the HBO series Six Feet Under the body of a man is shown being moved from a hospital bed to a gurney in the episode The Will. As the body is moved, a sheet falls off the body, and the man’s penis is exposed. A character from the show, Frederico, then tells Nate about “Angel’s Lust” which is another term for a death erection.

<text>ResEdit is a discontinued developer tool application for the Apple Macintosh, used to create and edit resources directly in the Mac&#x27;s resource fork architecture. It was an alternative to tools such as REdit, and the resource compiler &quot;Rez.&quot; For the average user, ResEdit was generally easier to use, because it used a graphical user interface. Although it had been intended to be a developer tool, power users often used it to edit icons, menus, and other elements of an application&#x27;s GUI, customizing it to their own preferences.

Resources on the Macintosh could be of many different types, and in fact any arbitrary data could be turned into a resource. While the system defined many standard formats for particular kinds of resources (for example, an icon, or a window template), programmers were also free to define their own. ResEdit included support for editing many of the standard types and for creating arbitrary resources with any structure a programmer saw fit.
ResEdit was one of the earliest examples of a GUI layout tool, an essential component for rapid application development. For example, the classic Mac OS defined a standard resource called a dialog template and a dialog items list (resource types &#x27;DLOG&#x27; and &#x27;DITL&#x27; respectively). In ResEdit, it was possible to simply create these types and add GUI elements to them in an almost WYSIWYG fashion, such that a user interface could be designed directly as it would appear to the end user of the application. Later, the application code could create a functional dialog box using the stored resource data which matches the appearance you lay out in ResEdit. When ResEdit first appeared in the mid-1980s, this was a revolutionary innovation, today it is commonplace for programmers. ResEdit includes standard editors for window templates (codice_1), menus (codice_2), dialog boxes, controls (codice_3), color palettes (codice_4 and codice_5), icons (codice_6, codice_7, codice_8), and various other standard types.

One of ResEdit&#x27;s most powerful features (which first appeared with ResEdit version 2.0) is the ability to define arbitrary data structures as resources using a simple template building feature. Here, the programmer can simply add elemental data types to a list to define a template (itself stored as a resource of type codice_9). This template allows ResEdit to build a GUI editor on the fly that allows entry of data and package it into the structure defined in the template. It&#x27;s a simple matter for a programmer to define a matching data structure in a chosen programming language, such as C, load the resource in a standard manner and access the data as the defined C type. ResEdit includes a number of predefined templates for many standard OS resources that do not require a graphical editor.

ResEdit was never upgraded to run natively on PowerPC-based Macintoshes after the migration from Motorola 68000 series, and not on Mac OS X. Apple now discourages the use of resource forks in new macOS applications, preferring the more portable NeXT-derived application bundles. A long-standing third-party commercial alternative named Resorcerer remains available, and more recently there have been a number of attempts to build open-source macOS-native resource editors, including one called ResKnife. ResEdit will run in Mac OS X&#x27;s Classic compatibility mode, but Classic is neither available on Intel Macintosh computers, nor in Mac OS X v10.5 or later. However, an Intel Mac can run ResEdit via an emulator such as SheepShaver or Basilisk II.

The last official version of ResEdit is 2.1.3, released in August 1994. Unofficial hacks released as ResEdit 2.1.4 and later exist, adding features such as a decompiler and the ability to edit data forks, but these are unsupported by Apple.

<text>Reuben David Thorne (born 2 January 1975) is a New Zealand rugby union player, and former captain of the national team, the All Blacks. Now involved with Big Brother Big Sister and is the Christ College first xv coach.

==Professional career and the All Blacks==
===Super 12===
Playing as a flanker, Thorne first appeared in the Super 12 with the Canterbury Crusaders in 1998. He became captain in 2002, immediately leading the Crusaders to Super 12 victory in an unprecedented &quot;perfect&quot; season—13 wins from 13 games. In 2003 and 2004 the Crusaders were runners-up in the Super 12 under his leadership.

Thorne was a rarity among All Blacks, especially captains, in that he never made an international appearance at any age-group level. He earned his first All Black cap in 1999, playing a single test against the Springboks before the 1999 Rugby Union World Cup. Taking over as captain from an injured Anton Oliver, he led the All Blacks throughout 2002 and 2003, apart from a brief tour of the UK and France in November 2002 which he missed due to a chronic ankle problem, causing former captain Taine Randell to be briefly recalled to the skipper&#x27;s role. Although the team&#x27;s record was excellent under Thorne&#x27;s leadership (playing 22 test matches for 19 wins and 3 losses, and winning the Tri Nations Series both years and the Bledisloe Cup in 2003), his captaincy ended on a low note as the team was eliminated by the Wallabies in the semi-finals of the 2003 Rugby Union World Cup. Following the World Cup, Thorne was replaced as All Blacks captain by Tana Umaga.

Thorne appeared again for the All Blacks on the 2004 end of year tour, where he was an unused reserve against Wales at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff and started as a lock against the Barbarians at Twickenham. He was called in as a replacement for Jono Gibbes, who was ruled out of the tour due to injury. His record as an All Black stands at 50 tests played (22 as captain) for 42 wins and 8 losses, with 5 tries scored.

===Super 14===
On 28 May 2006 Thorne was named captain for the 2006 Junior All Blacks season , but the next day he withdrew from the squad to undertake &quot;a recovery and reconditioning programme.&quot; Thorne was a surprise selection for the All Blacks for the 2006 Tri Nations Series when it was named on 26 June 2006. On 22 July 2006, he played his first test for the All Blacks since the 2003 Rugby World Cup, against the same team he debuted against, the Springboks. He was then rested for the first half of the 2007 Super 14 season as part of the All Blacks reconditioning programme. He returned to play for the Crusaders that year, and was picked in the All Blacks squad for the 2007 Tri Nations Series and the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Although he did play in the 2007 World Cup he was not in the team for the All Blacks quarter-final loss to France. On 29 November 2007 Thorne announced that following the 2008 Super 14 season he left New Zealand to play for Yamaha Jubilo in Japan. He currently plays for the Honda Heat.

Thorne was called into the Crusaders squad following numerous injuries for matches in South Africa in the 2011 Super 15. Thorne made his return on the bench against the Cheetahs.

<doc id="745028" wikidata="Q6980595" url="?curid=745028" title="Natural Resources Conservation Service">
<text>Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), formerly known as the Soil Conservation Service (SCS), is an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) that provides technical assistance to farmers and other private landowners and managers.

Its name was changed in 1994 during the presidency of Bill Clinton to reflect its broader mission. It is a relatively small agency, currently comprising about 12,000 employees. Its mission is to improve, protect, and conserve natural resources on private lands through a cooperative partnership with state and local agencies. While its primary focus has been agricultural lands, it has made many technical contributions to soil surveying, classification, and water quality improvement. One example is the Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP), set up to quantify the benefits of agricultural conservation efforts promoted and supported by programs in the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (2002 Farm Bill). NRCS is the leading agency in this project.

==History==
The agency was founded largely through the efforts of Hugh Hammond Bennett, a soil conservation pioneer who worked for the Department of Agriculture from 1903 to 1952. Bennett&#x27;s motivation was based on his knowledge of the detrimental effects of soil erosion and the impacts on U.S lands that led to the Dust Bowl in the 1930s. On September 13, 1933, the Soil Erosion Service was formed in the Department of the Interior, with Bennett as chief. The service was transferred to the Department of Agriculture on March 23, 1935, and was shortly thereafter combined with other USDA units to form the Soil Conservation Service by the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act of 1935.

The SCS was in charge of 500 Civilian Conservation Corps camps between 1933 and 1942. The primary purpose of these camps was erosion control. In the 1980s, there were around 3,000 local Soil Conservation Service districts throughout the United States, each with elected executive boards. These districts provided financial as well as technical support, such as assistance inventorying natural resources, to land owners in their conservation efforts upon request.

Bennett continued as chief until his retirement in 1952. As part of the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994, the agency was renamed the Natural Resources Conservation Service during the tenure of Chief Paul Johnson.

== Programs and services ==
NRCS offers technical and financial assistance to farmers and ranchers. The financial assistance is authorized by the &quot;Farm Bill&quot;, a law that is renewed every five years. The 2014 Farm Bill consolidated 23 programs into 15. NRCS offers these services to private land owners, conservation districts, tribes, and other types of organizations. NRCS also collects and shares information on the nation&#x27;s soil, water, air, and plants.

===Farm bill===
The &quot;Conservation&quot; title of the Farm Bill (Title II in the 2014 bill) provides the funding to agricultural producers, and a conservation plan must be included. All of these programs are voluntary. The main programs include:

====Environmental Quality Incentives Program ====

The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) provides assistance to landowners to help them improve their soil, water and related natural resources, including grazing lands, wetlands, and wildlife habitat. Congress established the program in the 1996 farm bill to provide primarily cost-sharing assistance, but also technical and educational assistance, aimed at promoting production and environmental quality, and optimizing environmental benefits.

==== Conservation Stewardship Program ====
The Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP), established by the 2008 Farm Bill, is targeted to producers who maintain a higher level of environmental stewardship.

==== Regional Conservation Partnership Program ====
Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) consolidated four programs from the 2008 Farm Bill. It aims at more regional or watershed scale projects, rather than individual farms and ranches.

==== Agricultural Conservation Easement Program ====
The Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP) was another consolidation effort of the 2014 Farm Bill, which includes the former Grasslands Reserve Program, Farm, and Ranch Lands Protection Program, and Wetlands Reserve Program. ACEP includes technical and financial help to maintain or improve land for agriculture or environmental benefits.

====Healthy Forests Reserve Program====
(HFRP) Landowners volunteer to restore and protect forests in 30 or 10 year contracts. This program hands assisting funds to participants.
The objectives of HFRP are to:
# Promote the recovery of endangered and threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA)
# Improve plant and animal biodiversity
# Enhance carbon sequestration

===NRCS National Ag Water Management Team===
(AGWAM) Serves 10 states in the Midwest United States in helping to reduce nitrate levels in soil due to runoff from fertilized farmland. The project began in 2010 and initially focused on the Mississippi Basin area. The main goal of the project is to implement better methods of managing water drainage from agricultural uses, in place of letting the water drain naturally as it had done in the past. In October 2011, The National &quot;Managing Water, Harvesting Results&quot; Summit was held to promote the drainage techniques used in hopes of people adopting them nationwide.

====Snow Survey and Water Supply Forecasting====
Includes water supply forecasts, reservoirs, and the Surface Water Supply Index (SWSI) for Alaska and other Western states. NRCS agents collect data from snowpack and mountain sites to predict spring runoff and summer streamflow amounts. These predictions are used in decision making for agriculture, wildlife management, construction and development, and several other areas. These predictions are available within the first five days of each month from January to June.

===Conservation Technical Assistance Program===
(CTA) Is a blanket program which involves conservation efforts on soil and water conservation, as well as management of agricultural wastes, erosion, and general longterm sustainability. NRCS and related agencies work with landowners, communities, or developers to protect the environment. Also serve to guide people to comply with acts such as the Highly Erodible Land, Wetland (Swampbuster), and Conservation Compliance Provisions acts. The CTA can also cover projects by state, local, and federal governments.

===Gulf of Mexico Initiative===
Is a program to assist gulf bordering states (Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas) improve water quality and use sustainable methods of farming, fishing, and other industry. The program will deliver up to 50 million dollars over 2011–2013 to apply these sustainable methods, as well as wildlife habitat management systems that do not hinder agricultural productivity, and prevent future over use of water resources to protect native endangered species.

===International programs===
The NRCS (formerly SCS) has been involved in soil and other conservation issues internationally since the 1930s. The main bulk of international programs focused on preventing soil erosion by sharing techniques known to the United States with other areas. NRCS sends staff to countries worldwide to conferences to improve knowledge of soil conservation. There is also international technical assistance programs similar to programs implemented in the United States. There are long-term technical assistance programs in effect with one or more NRCS staff residing in the country for a minimum of one year. There are currently long-term assistance programs on every continent. Short-term technical assistance is also available on a two-week basis.

These programs are to encourage local landowners and organizations to participate in the conservation of natural resources on their land, and lastly, landscape planning has a goal to solve problems dealing with natural resource conservation with the help of the community in order to reach a desired future outcome.

==Technical resources==
=== Soil ===
There is a long history of the federal Soil Survey Program, including federal scientists and cooperators working through the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS). Soil survey products include the &quot;Web Soil Survey,&quot;
the &quot;NCSS Characterization Database&quot; and many investigative reports and journal articles. In 2015 NRCS began broad support of soil health, which incorporates less tillage and more cover crops to reduce erosion and improve the diversity of the soil. Information is maintained in the Soil Survey Geographic database (SSURGO) dataset.

===Water===
Water pollution related to agricultural practices is addressed in several NRCS programs which provide financial and technical assistance. Nutrient pollution caused by excessive nitrogen and phosphorus in farm surface runoff depletes oxygen levels and creates algal blooms in lakes, streams and rivers, harming aquatic life. Excessive sedimentation and pathogens from agricultural pollution can also have major impacts on water quality, and some NRCS projects focus on these problems with land owners and their water systems.

==== Water management ====
The practice of water management focuses on the efficiently controlling the flow of water while causing the least amount of damage to life and property. This helps to provide protection in high risk areas from flooding. Irrigation management is the most efficient way to use and recycle water resources for land owners and farmers. Drainage management is the manipulation of the sub-surface drainage networks in order to properly disperse the water to the correct geographical areas. The NRCS engineering vision is constantly making improvements to irrigation systems in a way that incorporates every aspect of water restoration.

==== Water quality ====
A team of highly trained experts on every aspect of water is employed by the NRCS to analyze water from different sources. They work in many areas such as: hydrology and hydraulics, stream restoration, wetlands, agriculture, agronomy, animal waste management, pest control, salinity, irrigation, and nutrients in water.

==== Watershed program ====

Under watershed programs the NRCS works with states, local governments, and tribes by providing funding and resources in order to help restore and also benefit from the programs. They provide: watershed protection, flood mitigation, water quality improvement, soil erosion reduction, irrigation, sediment control, fish and wildlife enhancement, wetland and wetland function creation and restoration, groundwater recharge, easements, wetland and floodplain conservation easements, hydropower, watershed dam rehabilitation.

=== Plants and animals ===
Plants and animals play a huge role in the health of our ecosystems. A delicate balance exists between relationships of plants and animals. If an animal is introduced to an ecosystem that is not native to the region that it could destroy plants or animals that should not have to protect itself from this particular threat. As well as if a plant ends up in a specific area where it should not be it could have adverse effects on the wildlife that try to eat it. NRCS protects the plants and animals because they provide us with food, materials for shelter, fuel to keep us warm, and air to breathe. Without functioning ecosystems we would have none of the things mentioned above. NRCS provides guidance to assist conservationists and landowners with enhancing plant and animal populations as well as helping them deal with invasive species.

==== Fish and wildlife ====
NRCS for years has been working toward restoration, creation, enhancement, and maintenance for aquatic life on the nearly 70% of land that is privately owned in order to keep the habitats and wildlife protected. NRCS with a science-based approach, provides equipment to wildlife and fish management. They also do this for landowners who qualify .

==== Insects and pollinators ====
Pollination by insects plays a huge role in the production of food crop and flowering plants. Without pollinators searching for nectar and pollen for food the plants would not produce a seed that will create another plant. NRCS sees the importance of this process so they are taking measures to increase the declining number of pollinators. There are many resources provided from the NRCS that will help any individual do their part in conservation of these important insects. Such as Backyard Conservation which tells an individual exactly how to help by just creating a small habitat in minutes. There are many others such as: Plants for pollinators, pollinators habitat in pastures, pollinator value of NRCS plant releases in conservation planting, plant materials publications relating to insects and pollinators, PLANTS database: NRCS pollinator documents. All of these are valuable resources that any individual can take advantage of.

==== Invasive species and pests ====
Invasive species cause America&#x27;s reduction in economic productivity and ecological decline. NRCS works in collaboration with the plant materials centers scattered throughout the country in order to get a handle on the invasive species of plants. These centers scout out the plants and take measures to control and eradicate them from the particular area.

==== Livestock ====
Livestock management is an area of interest for the NRCS because if not maintained valuable resources such as food, wools, and leather would not be available. The proper maintenance of livestock can also improve soil and water resources by providing a waste management system so that run off and erosion is not a problem. The NRCS provides financial assistance to land owners with grazing land and range land that is used by livestock in order to control the run off of waste into fresh water systems and prevent soil erosion.

==== Plants ====

Plants are a huge benefit to the health of ecosystems. NRCS offers significant amounts of resources to individuals interested in conserving plants. From databases full of information to financial assistance the NRCS works hard to provide the means needed to do so. The plant materials program, Plant materials centers, Plant materials specialists, PLANTS database, National Plant Data Team (NPDT) are all used together to keep our ecosystems as healthy as possible. This includes getting rid of unwanted species and building up species that have been killed off that are beneficial to the environment. 
The NRCS utilizes a very wide range of interdisciplinary resources.

The NRCS also utilizes the following disciplines in order to maximize efficiency: 
* Agronomy
* Erosion
* Air Quality and Atmospheric Change
* Animal Feeding Operations and Confined Animal Feeding Operations
* Biology
* Conservation Innovation Grants
* Conservation Practices
* Cultural Resources
* Economics
* Energy
* Engineering
* Environmental Compliance
* Field Office Technical Guide
* Forestry,
* Maps
* Data and Analysis
* Nutrient Management
* Pest Management
* Range and Pasture
* Social Sciences
* Soils, and Water Resources
These Science-Based technologies are all used together in order to provide the best conservation of natural resources possible.

== Supported organizations ==
* Great Basin Plant Materials Center based in Fallon, Nevada.
Established in 2006, the GBVPMC serves Nevada, California, and parts of Utah and Oregon. The center&#x27;s main purpose is to combat the damage done by invasive plant species in the area, which have greatly damaged ecosystems in the Great Basin. They also aid in restoring ecosystems damaged by fires, climate change, drought, or other natural disasters. The centers provide native plants to help restore these damaged areas. They also work on developing plant organisms and technologies that are suited for the dry, high salt content soil of the area.

* National Association of Conservation Districts
(NACD) A non-profit agency that serves 3,000 conservation districts across the United States. There are about 17,000 individuals who serve on the governing boards of conservation districts. Local conservation districts work with landowners to help manage land and water resources. The mission of NACD is to provide leadership and a unified voice for natural resource conservation in the United States. The NACD grew in the 1930s from a statewide operation in Oklahoma, and many independent districts, to a unified National organization in 1946.

<doc id="745045" wikidata="Q577926" url="?curid=745045" title="Earthworm Jim 2">
<text>Earthworm Jim 2 is a 1995 run and gun platform video game and the sequel to &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot;, and the second and final game in the &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; series developed by original creators Doug TenNapel, David Perry and Shiny Entertainment. It was released in late 1995 and early 1996 depending on the region and video game console, initially coming out for the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System, before being ported to other platforms.

==Gameplay==

The purpose of the game is largely the same as it was in the original &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot;; traverse through the levels in order to save Princess What&#x27;s-Her-Name from Psy-Crow. However, gameplay is much more diverse than the original.

While the majority of levels are still based on run and gun and platformer elements, separate levels incorporate different gameplay mechanics as well. Some levels, like the opening level, &quot;Anything but Tangerines&quot;, and the game&#x27;s eighth level, &quot;Level Ate&quot;, play mostly the same as the original &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot;, with the exception of there being a larger variety of moves at the player&#x27;s disposal. For instance, there are more types of guns to use once found in a level, such as an auto-aiming gun, or the &quot;Barn Blaster&quot; gun which takes out every enemy visible on the screen. New power-ups include the chip butty, which increases Jim&#x27;s suit power to 200%. Additionally, Jim&#x27;s friend, Snott, travels with him and can be used to stick to and swing from other slimy green surfaces or as a parachute upon jumping.

Other levels stray much further from this formula. In the third level, &quot;Villi People&quot;, the player must guide Jim, in the disguise of a blind cave salamander, through intestinal passages, while avoiding exploding sheep and hazards embedded in the floors and walls. The latter part of the level suddenly switches to a game show/trivia format, where the player has to answer nonsensical multiple choice questions that commonly have no logically correct answer. Another level, aptly titled &quot;Inflated Head&quot;, has Jim&#x27;s head inflated much like a balloon, and the player must control Jim as he floats upward, avoiding sharp objects which cause him to fall back down to the start, all the while dodging Evil the Cat&#x27;s attacks.

Yet another, &quot;The Flyin&#x27; King&quot;, plays as an isometric shooter, which includes Jim on his &quot;pocket rocket&quot;, where a balloon with a bomb must be directed to the end of the level, and defended from enemies, in order to defeat Major Mucus. The last level of the game, &quot;See Jim Run Run Jim Run&quot;, is not a typical boss fight, but rather, a race against Psy-Crow through an obstacle course to get to Princess What&#x27;s-Her-Name. The game ends with Jim saving the Princess, but all three characters eventually turn out to be cows in disguise.

==Versions and releases==
The game, much like the first, was developed for the Sega Genesis and then ported over to the Super NES. They were released virtually simultaneously and were largely the same game, the only differences being that the Super NES version had alternate background art, and the ability to switch weapons. The Genesis version was released in Japan exclusively via the Sega Channel service. Rainbow Arts ported the game to MS-DOS along with the first game, in a package titled &quot;Earthworm Jim 1 &amp; 2: The Whole Can &#x27;O Worms&quot;. This port featured an upgraded CD-DA music soundtrack, more voice clips and redrawn graphics, but lacked the &quot;Lorenzen&#x27;s Soil&quot; level. Versions for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation (both developed by a separate studio, Screaming Pink, Inc.) were also released, which contained the upgraded audio and all the levels from the original. Both of these versions were identical, and contained background art and graphical differences separate from any other versions of the game. In a 1994 conference held on CompuServe with Shiny Entertainment prior to its release, David Perry stated that they were considering making a version of the game for the Atari Jaguar, which never came to fruition.

Many years later, it was ported to a newer generation of systems. A Game Boy Advance port, developed by Russian studio SuperEmpire Inc, based on the Super NES release, was released in 2002. It has been widely criticized for poor graphics, bad sound and music, and very glitchy gameplay. The Genesis version was later released for download on the Wii via the Virtual Console in 2009, as well. The MS-DOS version was re-released through DOSbox emulation on GOG.com and Steam. The Super NES version was re-released on the Nintendo Switch Online Service in March 2022.

==Reception==

Reception for the game was very positive. Sources such as &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;GameZone&quot; declared it as better overall than the original, which was also very well received. &quot;Destructoid&quot; praised the game&#x27;s humor, innovative gameplay, and &quot;minigame&quot; style levels spread throughout the game were also held in high regard as a welcome change from the linear gameplay common at the time. Reviewing the Genesis version, one reviewer for &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; disapproved of the game, remarking &quot;where the first had technique, this one just gets cheap&quot;, but the remaining three declared it a worthy sequel. They commented that it retains the same great gameplay of the original while adding excellent new weapons and levels &quot;which are even crazier than before&quot;. Reviewers for &quot;GamePro&quot; gave rave reviews for both the Genesis and Super NES versions. They noted that the basic gameplay and premise are unchanged from the first game, but highly praised the new level designs, diverse soundtrack, and improved animations for the title character, with one of the reviewers concluding &quot;&quot;Earthworm Jim 2&quot; manages to exceed the lofty standards of the first game.&quot; A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; likewise felt that the inventive new level designs were more than enough to make the game feel fresh in spite of it using the same gameplay. He summarized that &quot;For the most part, this long-awaited sequel has answered the success of the first installment using more of the same humor, action, and skill, adding a few surprises this time around.&quot; &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; (previously &quot;Sega Magazine&quot;) gave the Genesis version a 94%, citing the variety of gameplay styles with &quot;every one, in every way, sickeningly well implemented.&quot;

While the Genesis and Super NES versions were generally held in high regard, some of the other versions were more poorly received. The PlayStation port, which contained the same content as the original releases, received a poor review 3/10 score from &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;, due to there being no significant improvements, despite the obviously more powerful hardware of the PlayStation. The Sega Saturn version, though generally well received, also encountered similar criticism, with &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; describing &quot;Earthworm Jim 2&quot; as an excellent game, but derided the lack of advancements in the Saturn version, and summarized it as &quot;a great game – a year ago. On a different console.&quot; A &quot;Next Generation&quot; critic was more forgiving of the lack of major enhancements, contending that &quot;the title is amazingly fun even on a machine designed for 3D gaming&quot;, though he acknowledged those who had already played the Genesis or Super NES version would have no reason to play the game again on the Saturn. &quot;GamePro&quot;″s Major Mike disagreed, contending that changes such as the new backgrounds, remixed music, and loading screens make the game feel fresh and new.

The 2002 Game Boy Advance release was panned by critics as well, but this time due to the game having an &quot;unfinished&quot; engine, glitched graphics, and an unpredictable save system. &quot;IGN&quot; stated &quot;the action tends to slow down in the most unlikely locations ...and the gameplay&#x27;s inconsistent...load a game where you instantly die for no apparent reason&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; felt similarly, calling it &quot;unplayable&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; nominated &quot;Earthworm Jim 2&quot; for its 2002 &quot;Most Disappointing Game on Game Boy Advance&quot; and &quot;Worst Game on Game Boy Advance&quot; awards. Reviewing the Virtual Console release of the Genesis version, Marcel van Duyn of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; had mixed reactions on various different gameplay mechanics.

=== Accolades ===
&quot;Earthworm Jim 2&quot; was nominated for the Video Software Dealers Association&#x27;s &quot;Video Game of the Year&quot; for 1995, losing to &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2&quot;. In 1996, &quot;GamesMaster&quot; ranked the Mega Drive version second in their &quot;The GamesMaster Mega Drive Top 10.&quot; In 1998, &quot;Saturn Power&quot; listed the Saturn version 90th in their Top 100 Sega Saturn Games. IGN rated the game 40th on its &quot;Top 100 SNES Games of All Time.&quot; They praised the Snott dynamic that it added a lot to the gameplay experience.

==Sequels==
The &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; series had future sequels, including &quot;Earthworm Jim 3D&quot; and &quot;Earthworm Jim: Menace 2 the Galaxy&quot;. They were developed by different developers, with vastly different gameplay and styles, and received generally negative reception.

<doc id="745057" wikidata="Q3914547" url="?curid=745057" title="Greater Binghamton Airport">
<text>Greater Binghamton Airport is a county-owned American airport eight miles north of Binghamton, in Broome County, New York. It is in East Maine, New York and serves the Southern Tier of New York.

The airport was named Broome County Airport through the 1970s. It was renamed [[Edwin A. Link]] Field-Broome County Airport to honor the inventor of the aircraft instrument simulator, the Link Trainer, a name it kept until the 1990s when it was again renamed as Binghamton Regional Airport. The name Greater Binghamton Airport was chosen in 2003. The field is still named in Link&#x27;s honor.

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport (more than 10,000 enplanements per year). Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 108,325 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 98,090 in 2009 and 108,988 in 2010.

==History==
The Greater Binghamton Airport (BGM) (originally Broome County Airport) has served Binghamton for six decades. Development started in 1945, due to difficult night operations at the Tri-Cities Airport in Endicott, New York during World War II. Broome County Airport opened in 1951 with a 5,600-foot main Runway 16/34, and a 5,002-foot crosswind Runway 10/28.

An approach lighting system was added in 1959 to the runway 34 approach end. The main runway was extended 700 feet in 1969. In the early 1980s the field was renamed Edwin A. Link Field-Broome County Airport in honor of Edwin A. Link a well-known inventor and aviation pioneer in the Binghamton area. Mr. Link was known for the creation of the Link Trainer, the first trainer that taught pilots how to fly in instrument meteorological conditions using only the instruments in the cockpit (&quot;Facility Orientation Guide&quot;, n.d.).

In the 1950s Mohawk, Trans World Airlines, and Colonial Airlines (later Eastern Air Lines) stopped at BGM; TWA left in 1965 and Eastern left in 1969-70. Mohawk&#x27;s successors&#x27; jets still stopped into the 1990s. In the 1980s a commuter airline, Brockway Air, flew Beechcraft 1900s and Fokker F-27s from Broome County airport to Syracuse, Boston, Albany, Keene, NH, Worcester, Burlington, and Rutland.

The south, southeast-facing runway 16 gained an instrument landing system during the 1970s along with a medium intensity approach lighting system with runway alignment indicator lights to lower landing minimums, but the localizer antenna was placed to the east of the runway with an offset. The airport began extending the north end of the main runway 16/34 in 1988; the extension from 6,298 to 7,500 feet was completed in October 1990. In 1991 the airport was renamed to Binghamton Regional Airport. In 2002 Runway 16/34 was shortened to 7,100 feet to make room for an Engineered Material Arresting System (EMAS). The EMAS is a bed of material that will crush under the weight of an aircraft, stopping the aircraft in the event of a runway overrun. 
In 2003 the airport was again renamed to the Greater Binghamton Airport. The airport&#x27;s old linear terminal was unable to keep up with regional jet traffic, and four new jet bridges opened in July 2004. BGM got a $12.3 million federal grant in September 2011 to replace the old EMAS system installed in 2002 and extend Runway 16/34 to 7,304 feet. The project was completed in November 2012 and led to a displaced threshold on Runway 34.

The airport lost significant airline service in the 2010s, with United Airlines and American Airlines exiting the airport in 2016, leaving the airport with one carrier, a single Delta Air Lines route to Detroit, for several years. 

In August 2022, low-cost carrier Avelo Airlines announced new service from Binghamton to Fort Myers and Orlando in Florida. These flights would be operated by a Boeing 737-800 aircraft. This is the first service to Florida the airport has had. The airline canceled the launch of its Fort Myers focus city on October 13, citing a lack of bookings due to Hurricane Ian.

On September 14, 2022, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced that the Greater Binghamton Airport was being awarded funds for renovations under the state&#x27;s Upstate Airport Economic Development and Revitalization initiative. US$32 million of state funds and $5M from other sources was earmarked for upgrades including integration of the general aviation and passenger terminals, replacement of the loading-zone canopy, and construction of new facilities for U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

==Facilities==
The airport covers 1,199 acres (485 ha) at an elevation of 1,636 feet (499 m). It has two asphalt runways: 16/34 is 7,305 by 150 feet (2,227 x 46 m) and 10/28 is 5,001 by 150 feet (1,524 x 46 m).

In the year ending January 31, 2021 the airport had 13,323 aircraft operations, average 36 per day: 84% general aviation, 13% air taxi, 3% military, and &lt;1% airline. 39 aircraft were then based at the airport: 25 single-engine, 10 multi-engine, and 4 jet.

As of 2020, the airport has one scheduled flight for both arrivals and destinations, a Delta Connection flight to Detroit.

<doc id="745066" wikidata="Q83816" url="?curid=745066" title="AJ Styles">
<text>Allen Neal Jones (born June 2, 1977), better known by his ring name AJ Styles (also stylized A.J. Styles), is an American professional wrestler. He is signed to WWE, where he performs on the Raw brand.

Jones debuted in 1998 and competed for various independent promotions before gaining initial mainstream exposure in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 2001. He gained prominence after signing with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) having been described as &quot;the cornerstone of the company since its inception&quot;; he won the TNA World Heavyweight Championship twice, the NWA World Heavyweight Championship three times, and was the inaugural titleholder of the X Division Championship, which he won six times. He is also the first TNA Triple Crown and Grand Slam champion. Jones simultaneously appeared in Ring of Honor (ROH) from 2002 to 2006, where he became the inaugural ROH Pure Champion. Jones has also wrestled extensively internationally, in promotions such as New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW), where he is a two-time IWGP Heavyweight Champion and the United Kingdom based Revolution Pro Wrestling (RevPro), where he is a former RPW British Heavyweight Champion.

Jones first appeared in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 2002, but declined a developmental contract. He returned to the company in 2016, and won the WWE Championship twice. With his second victory in Manchester, England, Jones is recognized by WWE as the first wrestler to win the title outside North America. At 371 days, he is tied with Randy Savage for the eighth-longest reign in title history. He also won the United States Championship three times, the Intercontinental Championship and the Raw Tag Team Championship once each, becoming the second wrestler (after Kurt Angle) to become a TNA and WWE Triple Crown winner and first Grand Slam champion in both promotions, as well as the third man (after Brock Lesnar and Angle) to be both IWGP and WWE Champion.

Jones has been thought of as a pillar of the wrestling industry for over two decades, being respected by fans and co-workers, and is considered one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time. He has headlined numerous pay-per-view events, including the respective premier events of WWE and TNA, WrestleMania and Bound for Glory. He ranked atop the annual &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; &quot;500&quot; in 2010, the first TNA wrestler to do so, was voted PWI Wrestler of the Year three times between 2016 and 2018, and Wrestler of the Decade in 2020. He also won 10 &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; awards, including Wrestler of the Year in 2015 and 2016, and was inducted in their Hall of Fame in 2017.

== Early life ==
Allen Neal Jones was born at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina, on June 2, 1977. He grew up in poverty with an abusive, alcoholic father. The family&#x27;s poverty was such that they could not afford cable television, which resulted in Jones being unable to watch professional wrestling, his childhood passion. He attended Johnson High School in Gainesville, Georgia, graduating in the class of 1996. Jones took up amateur wrestling in high school and became a two-time state wrestling champion. Jones then attended Anderson University in Anderson, South Carolina, where he was on a wrestling scholarship, and studying physical education. He was then invited by some of his friends to try professional wrestling. He entered a professional wrestling school because his friends were doing it and to find out whether he had a natural aptitude for it. To supplement his income, he worked by mowing lawns and driving an ambulance.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early career (1998–2001) ===
Jones was trained by Rick Michaels and debuted in 1998. In the Georgia-based National Championship Wrestling (NCW) promotion he wrestled as Mr. Olympia, a masked wrestler, losing to Michael Brooks in his first singles match. By August 1999, he had won the promotion&#x27;s Television Championship.

From 1999 to 2001, he generally competed in less notable independent promotions. In December 1999, NCW merged with NWA Georgia to form NWA Wildside, and Jones was renamed A.J. Styles. He appeared sporadically even after signing with NWA-TNA, and is a former NWA Georgia Heavyweight Champion, having defeated Rick Michaels for the title on December 22, 2001, at Christmas Chaos.

=== World Championship Wrestling (2001) ===
Atlanta-based World Championship Wrestling (WCW) had observed Styles&#x27; and Air Paris&#x27; program in NWA Wildside and offered each a contract in early 2001. Styles (renamed Air Styles) and Paris were placed in a tag team, which was named Air Raid. The team&#x27;s gimmick saw both men dress in G-suits, with Air Raid also appearing on &quot;Thunder&quot;. On the March 5, 2001, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, they were entered into a tournament for the newly created WCW Cruiserweight Tag Team Championship but were eliminated in the first round by eventual winners Elix Skipper and Kid Romeo.

=== World Wrestling Federation appearances (2001–2002) ===
On July 9, 2001, Styles had his first WWF tryout match against his trainer, Rick Michaels, before the taping of &quot;Raw&quot;. Styles won with a Shooting Star Press but was not offered a contract.

Styles made two more appearances for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 2002: on the January 26 episode of &quot;Metal&quot; (taped on January 21), in a losing effort against The Hurricane, and a dark match before the January 27 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; (taped on January 22), where he was defeated by Rico Constantino. After these matches, WWF offered Styles a developmental deal contract, which would require Styles to relocate to Cincinnati, Ohio, where the Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA) developmental territory was located. Styles ultimately declined the deal, as the move would interfere with his wife&#x27;s college plans. Despite this, Styles wrestled one non-contracted match for HWA, on February 19 against Matt Stryker in a losing effort.

=== Independent circuit (2001–2002) ===

On October 26, 2001, Styles participated in All Pro Wrestling&#x27;s King of the Indies tournament, defeating Jardi Frantz in his first-round match but was eliminated by Christopher Daniels in the quarter-finals the following night. On November 13, 2001, Styles debuted in Xcitement Wrestling Federation (XWF), competing in a battle royal against Billy Fives, Christopher Daniels, Juventud Guerrera, Kid Kash, Prince Iaukea, Psicosis and Quick Kick for the XWF Cruiserweight Championship, but was unsuccessful in winning the title. Later that night, Styles defeated Josh Mathews in a match taped for XWF television. The following night, Styles was defeated by Daniels, again in a match taped for the XWF television program.

Styles debuted for Australian promotion World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) on February 24, 2002, making his pay-per-view debut at The Revolution against Christopher Daniels, Low Ki, Shark Boy, Super Nova and Tony Mamaluke in a six-way cruiserweight survival elimination match, in a losing effort. On April 10, Styles faced Jerry Lynn and Super Nova in a three-way-dance, in a losing effort. On April 12, Styles defeated Nova in a tournament semi-final match at The Eruption for the International Cruiserweight Championship. Styles progressed to the final later that night in which he defeated Jerry Lynn to win the title, which he vacated soon after.

On March 2, Styles debuted in the East Coast Wrestling Association (ECWA), entering the promotion&#x27;s 6th annual Super 8 tournament. He defeated Xavier in the first round, as well as The Amazing Red in his semi-finals match, but was defeated in the final by Donovan Morgan. On June 15, Styles debuted in Game Changer Wrestling, entering the Jersey-J Cup tournament. In the first round, Styles defeated Qenaan Creed, he then progressed to the quarter-final, defeating Colt Cabana. In the semi-final, he was defeated by Reckless Youth and was eliminated from the tournament.

In October, Styles traveled to the UK, debuting in the Frontier Wrestling Alliance (FWA) on October 13, suffering a loss to Jonny Storm in his debut match at FWA: British Uprising. On October 15, Styles was defeated in an FWA British Heavyweight Championship number one contender round-robin challenge three-way match by Doug Williams and Jerry Lynn at FWA: Seasons Beatings. Later that night, Styles defeated Jody Fleisch in the same round-robin challenge. On November 1, Styles debuted in , taking part in the promotions annual Ted Petty Invitational tournament, but was defeated by Christopher Daniels in the first round.

=== Ring of Honor (2002–2006)===
==== Early years (2002–2004) ====

Styles debuted in Ring of Honor (ROH) at its third show, 2002&#x27;s A Night of Appreciation, and quickly became a main eventer (e.g., performing in main event matches against Low Ki for the ROH World Championship at Honor Invades Boston). After failing to win the title, he became the first holder of the Number One Contender&#x27;s Trophy, which was viewed within the promotion as a secondary championship at the time. At the First Anniversary Show in February 2003, Styles competed against Low Ki and Paul London in a three-way match, which was won by London. After this, Styles competed by himself and defeated The Backseat Boyz (Johnny Kashmere and Trent Acid), The Carnage Crew (HC Loc and Tony DeVito), and The S.A.T. (Joel and Jose Maximo), to receive a title shot for the ROH Tag Team Championship. He chose Amazing Red as his partner, and the two defeated The Prophecy (Christopher Daniels and Xavier) to win the championship. Styles then feuded with London, who was upset that he had chosen Red as his partner, wrestling to a draw at Night of the Grudges. Styles and Red then defeated The Briscoe Brothers (Jay and Mark Briscoe) on three separate occasions, but lost to The Prophecy. At Wrath of the Racket, Christopher Daniels and Dan Maff put Red out of action and Styles picked Homicide as his replacement partner. Styles and Homicide beat The Prophecy, but Styles had to vacate the title due to Red being sidelined by a legitimate injury.

After his reign as ROH Tag Team Champion, Styles took Jimmy Rave as his protégé and attempted to become the ROH World Champion, defeating Bryan Danielson at Main Event Spectacles to become the number one contender. At War of the Wire, Styles unsuccessfully challenged Samoa Joe for the title. He then defeated CM Punk, Jimmy Rave, and Matt Stryker in a one-night tournament at the Second Anniversary Show to become the first ROH Pure Wrestling Champion. Styles defeated Punk in a rematch with Ricky Steamboat as the guest referee at At Our Best for his final match for ROH in 2004, as TNA withdrew all of its contracted wrestlers from all ROH events and ROH vacated the title.

==== Feud with Jimmy Rave (2005–2006) ====
Styles returned to Ring of Honor at the Third Anniversary Celebration: Part Two to wrestle Jimmy Rave, who accused him of stealing the &quot;Styles Clash&quot; (which he called the &quot;Rave Clash&quot;) from him, though he was unsuccessful in defeating Rave. During his feud with Rave and The Embassy, Styles formed an alliance with Generation Next, who were also feuding with The Embassy. At Glory by Honor IV, Styles defeated Rave with Mick Foley in his corner, with the stipulation that the loser could no longer use the &quot;Rave&quot;/&quot;Styles Clash&quot; in Ring of Honor. At This Means War, he defeated Generation Next leader Austin Aries, who was attacked by The Embassy following the show. At Vendetta, Styles had his final match against The Embassy when he, along with Austin Aries, Jack Evans and Matt Sydal were defeated by Abyss, Alex Shelley, Jimmy Rave, and Prince Nana in an eight-man tag match.

Following his feud with The Embassy, Styles set his sights on winning a championship. At A Night of Tribute, Styles faced Christopher Daniels and Matt Sydal in a three-way match, which Daniels won. On the first show of 2006, Styles wrestled and defeated Matt Sydal, after which the two agreed to form a tag team and challenge for the ROH Tag Team Championship, which was held by Sydal&#x27;s Generation Next teammates Austin Aries and Roderick Strong. Before receiving a shot at the tag team title, Styles received a shot at the ROH World Championship when he was handpicked by Bryan Danielson, but he was unsuccessful. At the Fourth Anniversary Show, Styles and Sydal received their shot at the ROH Tag Team Championship, but were unable to defeat the champions.

After an absence, Styles returned at Death Before Dishonor IV, defeating Davey Richards. Styles returned at Time to Man Up, losing to Samoa Joe. In a pre-taped promo, Styles said he would be taking several months off from ROH following the match; however, ROH commentators continually referred to the match as his final match and even played a special tribute to him after it.

=== NWA: Total Nonstop Action / Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002–2014)===
==== NWA World Heavyweight Champion (2002–2004) ====
In May 2002, Styles was signed to a non-exclusive contract by NWA: Total Nonstop Action (NWA-TNA). He appeared on the first weekly TNA pay-per-view, teaming with Low Ki and Jerry Lynn and losing to The Flying Elvises (Jimmy Yang, Jorge Estrada and Sonny Siaki). The following week, Styles defeated Low Ki, Jerry Lynn and Psicosis in a double elimination match to become the inaugural TNA X Division Champion. He won a second title on the third TNA pay-per-view, teaming with Lynn and defeating Bruce and Lenny Lane in the finals of a tournament for the vacant NWA World Tag Team Championship. Styles successfully defended both titles in the following weeks but began to bicker with the veteran Lynn during their matches together. On August 7, Styles lost the X Division title to Low Ki in a three-way dance also involving Lynn. The following week, he and Lynn fought Jeff Jarrett and Ron Killings to a no contest, and the tag team title was held-up as a result. The following week, he and Lynn fought one another in a Falls Count Anywhere match (which was won by Lynn), a no disqualification match (which was won by Styles) and a ten-minute Iron Man match, which ended in a draw after both men scored three pinfalls. On August 28, Low Ki defended the X Division Championship against Lynn and Styles in a ladder match and lost the title to Lynn. Recruiting Mortimer Plumtree and Sonny Siaki as allies, Styles continued to feud with Lynn in successive weeks. On October 23, he defeated Syxx-Pac for the X Division Championship, but lost the title to Lynn on November 6 and tried unsuccessfully to regain it throughout the remainder of the year.

In 2003, Styles began focusing on the NWA World Heavyweight Championship when, after defeating David Flair on January 15 to become the number one contender, he recruited the help of Larry Zbyszko and associated himself with Vince Russo&#x27;s Sports Entertainment Xtreme (S.E.X.) stable. Styles faced NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett on February 19, but was defeated. In the course of the match, Styles became a fan favorite, attacking S.E.X. as they tried to interfere on his behalf because he did not want to win in that manner. Styles briefly teamed with D&#x27;Lo Brown, but disbanded for their world title aspirations, challenging each other on June 4 in a number one contenders match which was won by Styles. Styles defeated Jarrett and Raven in a three-way match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship (becoming the first TNA Triple Crown) on June 11 with assistance from Russo. Throughout July 2003, Styles successfully defended the title in matches against D&#x27;Lo Brown and a myriad selection of opponents before dropping the title back to Jarrett on October 22. Following his loss, Styles reverted to being a fan favorite while Jarrett became a villain. On November 12, he teamed with Sting to defeat Lex Luger and Jeff Jarrett, though his bid for the title on December 3 was unsuccessful due to interference from Kid Kash.

Styles feuded with Abyss and Jeff Jarrett throughout January, and on February 4, 2004, after Styles demanded a title shot, Jarrett&#x27;s ally Don Callis forced him to team with Abyss in a match with the NWA World Tag Team Champions, Kevin Northcutt and Legend, which Styles&#x27; won, despite being abandoned by Abyss. The following week, Styles defeated Abyss in a match to determine the sole owner of the tag team championship by disqualification after Jarrett interfered, but his victory was overturned by Callis, leading to another match the following week which was won by Abyss after Lex Luger interfered, thus granting Abyss sole control of the tag team championship. On March 17, Abyss defeated Styles to become the number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Russo granted Styles a championship steel cage match against Jarret on April 21, where he won his second world title. He successfully defended the title in matches with Ron Killings, Raven and Chris Harris, and on May 19 he defended against all three men in a four-way title match. Styles lost the title to Killings after Jarrett interfered in the match, hitting him with a guitar.

==== X Division Champion (2004–2007) ====

Styles returned to the X Division shortly thereafter, winning a four-way match to become the number one contender to the X Division Championship on the June 4 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;. On June 9, he defeated Frankie Kazarian to become a three-time X Division Champion. In the following weeks, Styles feuded with Kid Kash and Dallas, while successfully defending the title in matches with Kazarian and Mr. Águila. An additional match on June 23 with the debuting Jeff Hardy was interrupted by Kash and Dallas. On July 28, he defended the title against Kazarian and Michael Shane in an Ultimate X match. After Kash struck Styles with a crutch, Shane and Kazarian simultaneously retrieved the title belt and became co-X Division Champions. After several abortive attempts to regain the title, Styles fought Kash in a number of matches, culminating on September 8 in a tables match which was won by Styles. In October, Styles began feuding with Petey Williams (who by then was the TNA X Division Champion) and on November 7 at Victory Road, the first monthly pay-per-view event held by TNA, Styles failed to regain the title from Williams.

At Final Resolution, Styles won the X Division Championship for a fourth time in an Ultimate X match, defeating Chris Sabin and the reigning champion Petey Williams. Styles faced Christopher Daniels for the first time on January 21, 2005, and after failing to defeat him in ten minutes, qualified for a thirty-minute Iron Man match for the championship at Against All Odds, where Styles defeated Daniels to retain the title after initial tying and going into &quot;sudden death&quot; rules. The feud between Styles and Daniels continued and at Destination X on March 13, Styles lost the title to him in an Ultimate X Challenge also featuring Ron Killings and Elix Skipper.

After defeating Abyss at Lockdown to become the number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, Styles won his third world championship from Jeff Jarrett at Hard Justice, which he lost to Raven in a King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary. Styles then entered the TNA 2005 Super X Cup Tournament, which granted the winner a shot at the X Division Championship. Styles defeated Matt Bentley in the quarter-finals and Petey Williams in the semi-finals, but lost to Samoa Joe at Sacrifice. As Christopher Daniels (the reigning X Division champion) had interfered in the match, TNA Director of Authority Larry Zbyszko added Styles to the resultant title bout. At Unbreakable, Styles defeated Samoa Joe and Daniels in a critically lauded three-way match to become the X Division Champion for a fifth time.
At Bound for Glory, Styles successfully defended the title against Christopher Daniels in the second thirty-minute Iron Man. The following month at Genesis, Styles successfully defended the title against Petey Williams. Styles then started a feud with Joe, claiming that he had broken the unwritten &quot;code of the X Division&quot; by brutally beating Daniels. At Turning Point, Styles lost the X Division Championship to Joe. Styles was unsuccessful in retaining the title in a triple threat match, also featuring Daniels, at Against All Odds, and in an Ultimate X match at Destination X, which Daniels won. After Daniels lost the title back to Joe, Styles joined Daniels to challenge America&#x27;s Most Wanted for the NWA World Tag Team Championship. After losing to America&#x27;s Most Wanted in title matches on two occasions, Styles and Daniels won the NWA World Tag Team Championship at Slammiversary. They successfully retained against The Latin American Xchange (Homicide and Hernandez) (LAX) at Hard Justice, only to lose the title to them in a Border Brawl on the August 24 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;. They regained the title at No Surrender, but dropped them back to LAX at Bound for Glory in a Six Sides of Steel match.

On the November 2 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Styles pinned Chris Sabin to begin his sixth reign as the new X Division Champion. The match was also the quarter-finals of the Fight for the Right tournament for number one contendership to Sting&#x27;s NWA World Heavyweight Championship; Styles won the semi-final match on the November 9 &quot;Impact!&quot; but was pinned in the finals by Abyss. On the November 16 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Styles lost the X Division Championship to Daniels in a three-way match when Daniels scored the roll-up pinfall on Sabin. At Genesis, Styles lost to Christian Cage, which Styles blamed on Daniels, who had tried to intervene on his behalf.

Styles would then turn heel and feuded with Rhino for attempting to reconcile him with Daniels and at Turning Point he beat Rhino, and on the December 22 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Styles and Samoa Joe defeated Rhino and Kurt Angle. Rhino then defeated Styles in a Last Man Standing match at Final Resolution and at Destination X in an Elevation X match.

==== Various alliances (2007–2009) ====
Styles aligned with Christian Cage for Lockdown, forming Team Cage (later Christian&#x27;s Coalition), who were defeated by Team Angle at Lockdown. Styles teamed with Tomko to face Sting and Abyss at Victory Road, but were defeated. At No Surrender, Styles and Tomko won a ten-tag team gauntlet match to earn a tag team title match at Bound for Glory against Team Pacman (Adam Jones and Ron Killings), where they defeated them to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship. They successfully defended against LAX on the November 1 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; and at Genesis against The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott Steiner). Later that night, Styles and Tomko inadvertently cost Cage his match and helped Kurt Angle retain the world championship. Over the next few weeks, Styles struggled to choose between aligning Cage and Angle, until he joined The Angle Alliance at Final Resolution.

In February 2008, Styles was involved in a storyline in which he became accidentally married to Karen Angle. Meanwhile, Styles and Tomko lost the TNA World Tag Team Championship to Kaz and Super Eric. With Kurt constantly accusing Styles and Karen of an affair and both denying anything beyond friendship, Styles quit The Angle Alliance. In retaliation, Tomko cost Styles his King of the Mountain qualifying match against Booker T, turning Styles face. At Slammiversary, Styles defeated Angle after a distraction by Karen, but was beat-down by Angle and Tomko after the match. The feud continued through Hard Justice, where he defeated Angle in a Last Man Standing match. They continued trading wins and on the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; he defeated Angle for his Olympic gold medal. Styles also won the ladder rematch the following week to end their feud, but he was later asked to give Angle back his gold medal by Jeff Jarrett in an effort to try to mend things with Angle.
At Bound for Glory IV, Styles faced Christian Cage and Booker T in a three-way match in which Booker T won. Shortly after that, Booker T, Kurt Angle, Kevin Nash and Sting formed The Main Event Mafia, and Styles teamed up with Samoa Joe to fight them. On the October 30 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Styles and Joe formed a faction of younger wrestlers known as The TNA Front Line to combat The Main Event Mafia, who recruited Scott Steiner. Styles challenged Sting for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Turning Point and again in an eight-man tag team match at Final Resolution, but was unsuccessful each time. On the January 22, 2009, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Angle vowed to end Styles&#x27; career and later that night beat Styles in a tables match, where Styles was injured (kayfabe).

At Against All Odds, Styles returned by attacking Booker T and stealing his TNA Legends Championship. Styles defeated Booker T to become Legends Champion (and the first TNA Grand Slam Champion) at Destination X, and he retained in a rematch at Sacrifice. At Slammiversary, Styles competed in the King of the Mountain match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, but was unsuccessful after Samoa Joe turned on The Front Line and helped Angle win. Nash won Styles&#x27; Legends Championship at Victory Road. Following the loss, Styles began a &quot;Best of Three Series&quot; against Matt Morgan for entry into the TNA World Heavyweight Championship match with Sting and Angle at Hard Justice, which saw Styles winning the first match, but losing the following two, resulting in Morgan advancing to Hard Justice.

==== TNA World Heavyweight Champion (2009–2010) ====
On the August 20 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Styles was talked out of retiring by Sting, who said he had chosen Styles to carry the torch after him. At No Surrender, Styles won the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in a five-way match against Matt Morgan, Sting, Hernandez and defending champion Kurt Angle. At Bound for Glory, Styles retained the title against Sting, ending his undefeated streak at Bound for Glory in the process. Styles was mysteriously attacked by an anonymous assailant backstage leading him to believe it was Samoa Joe or Christopher Daniels, both of whom he faced the following month at Turning Point to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Styles continued to successfully defend the title against Desmond Wolfe on the December 10 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, against Daniels at Final Resolution, against Angle on the January 4, 2010, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; and against Tomko, who had been revealed as his mystery attacker, on the January 14 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;.

At Genesis, Styles defeated Angle in a Last Chance match to again retain the championship with assistance from Ric Flair, turning heel in the process. On the January 21 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Flair announced that he had aligned himself with Styles and christened Styles &quot;The New Nature Boy&quot;, but on the same episode Hulk Hogan announced a Genesis rematch, where if Flair were to interfere, Styles would be stripped of the title and awarded to Angle. During the match, Angle applied his signature move, the ankle lock, on Styles, who reversed it and applied the same move to Angle, when suddenly referee Earl Hebner, paid off by Flair, called for the bell although Angle did not submit. At Against All Odds, Styles retained the title against Samoa Joe, with help from Flair, in a match refereed by Eric Bischoff. On the March 8 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Styles teamed up with Ric Flair in a tag team match, in a losing effort against Abyss and Hulk Hogan. Styles defended the title against Abyss at Destination X in a match that went to no contest after Abyss hit Styles with a chokeslam through the ring. At Lockdown, Styles successfully defended the title against D&#x27;Angelo Dinero in a steel cage match. The following day on &quot;Impact!&quot;, Styles dropped the TNA World Heavyweight Championship to Rob Van Dam, ending his reign at a then-record 211 days. Styles faced Van Dam in a rematch at Sacrifice, but was defeated again.

==== Fortune (2010–2012) ====

With these shortcomings, Flair adopted Kazarian as his newest protégé, thus causing Styles to become jealous and tried to impress his mentor, but after failing to defeat Jay Lethal, Flair ordered him to &quot;go home&quot;. At Slammiversary VIII, Styles attempted to win Flair back by defeating Lethal, but lost again. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Flair, who had aligned himself with Styles, Desmond Wolfe, Kazarian, Robert Roode and James Storm, announced that he would reform the Four Horsemen under the new name , stating that each of them would have to earn their spots in the group. Styles and Kazarian earned their spots by defeating Samoa Joe and Rob Terry due to outside interference from Desmond Wolfe. On the July 22 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Styles defeated Terry to win the Global Championship (formerly the Legends Championship) for the second time. The following week on &quot;Impact!&quot;, Styles renamed the title the TNA Television Championship. (soon renamed Fortune) then feuded with EV 2.0 and Styles defeated EV 2.0 leader Tommy Dreamer in a non-title &quot;I Quit&quot; match at No Surrender, although Fortune were defeated in a Lethal Lockdown match by EV 2.0 at Bound for Glory. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Fortune formed an alliance with Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff&#x27;s new stable, Immortal. At Turning Point, Fortune defeated EV 2.0 in a ten-man tag team match and, as a result, EV 2.0&#x27;s Sabu was released from TNA. The following month at Final Resolution, Styles lost the Television Championship to Douglas Williams, who had turned on Fortune. On the February 3 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Fortune turned face by attacking Immortal, when they interfered in a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match between Mr. Anderson and Jeff Hardy. Flair, who did not take part in Fortune&#x27;s turn due to an injury, returned on the February 17 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, turning on Fortune during a match between Styles and Matt Hardy and jumping to Immortal. Styles faced Flair and Hardy in a three-way street fight match on March 10, where Styles was pinned by his former mentor, with assistance from Hardy. At Victory Road, Styles defeated Hardy in a singles match, despite interference from Flair.
On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Styles was sidelined with a storyline injury after Flair helped Bully Ray perform a powerbomb on him off the entrance stage through a table. Styles made his return on April 17 at Lockdown, attacking Bully Ray and helping Fortune defeat Immortal. He then feuded with Tommy Dreamer, who joined Immortal to save his job; Ray cost Styles his match against Dreamer at Sacrifice by hitting him with a chain. On the May 26 episode of the newly rebranded &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Styles and Daniels defeated Ray and Dreamer in a no disqualification street fight match, with Styles pinning Dreamer to avenge his loss at Sacrifice. The feud ended at Slammiversary IX, where Ray defeated Styles in a Last Man Standing match. Styles then defeated fellow Fortune member Christopher Daniels in the main event of Destination X. After weeks of asking for a rematch, Styles finally granted Daniels one on the September 1 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, where Daniels won and refused to shake hands with Styles. At Bound for Glory, Styles defeated Daniels in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match. After defeating Daniels again on the November 10 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Styles entered into a feud with TNA World Heavyweight Champion Bobby Roode, failing to capture the championship at Turning Point, tying him in an Iron-Man Match at Final Resolution, but losing the sudden-death tie-breaker on the following &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;. During the following episodes of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Styles and Kazarian, the last two members of Fortune, made it to the finals of the Wild Card Tournament. During the final match against Magnus and Samoa Joe on the January 5, 2012, episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Kazarian abandoned Styles and aligned himself with Christopher Daniels, effectively ending Fortune.

==== Final storylines (2012–2014) ====
On the February 9 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Kazarian, now seemingly a reluctant associate of Daniels, helped him defeat Styles in a singles match. Three days later at Against All Odds, Styles was defeated by Kazarian in a singles match. On the March 3 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Kazarian defeated Styles in a gauntlet match; had Styles been successful, Kazarian would have to explain his alliance with Daniels. Mr. Anderson then returned and aligned with Styles to defeat Daniels and Kazarian in tag team match at Victory Road and at Lockdown, where the two duos were on opposing teams in the annual Lethal Lockdown match. On the May 10 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Kazarian revealed that he originally aligned himself with Daniels to keep him from revealing Styles&#x27; secret, but changed his mind after learning what the secret was, at which point Daniels revealed a series of photographs insinuating a relationship between Styles and TNA president Dixie Carter.

At Sacrifice, Daniels and Kazarian cost Styles his match against Kurt Angle, who nonetheless saved Styles from a post-match beatdown. On May 31, Styles defeated Daniels in the main event of the first live episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, after which Daniels and Kazarian played audio of a phone conversation to prove an affair between Styles and Carter. At Slammiversary, Styles and Angle defeated Daniels and Kazarian to win their TNA World Tag Team Championship. On the following episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Styles entered the 2012 Bound for Glory Series, where he was eliminated in the opening gauntlet match by Daniels. On the June 21 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Styles and Carter revealed their secret—they were not having an affair but were helping an addicted pregnant woman named Claire Lynch overcome her problems. The following week on &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Styles and Angle lost the TNA World Tag Team Championship back to Daniels and Kazarian when Kazarian hit Styles with a steel chair, after which Daniels admitted that Styles and Carter had told the truth about Claire, but claimed that they had left out the part about Styles being the father of her unborn baby. Styles defeated Daniels in a Last Man Standing match at Destination X, and again in a Bound for Glory Series match and, per the pre-match stipulations, earned the right to get a paternity test on Claire&#x27;s baby. The following week on &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; it was revealed that Claire was not pregnant after all and her attorney revealed Daniels&#x27; and Kazarian&#x27;s plot to blackmail Styles. On the August 30 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Styles was eliminated in the 2012 Bound for Glory Series after losing to Samoa Joe. At No Surrender and Bound for Glory, Styles and Angle unsuccessfully challenged Daniels and Kazarian for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. Styles was pinned by James Storm in a three-way number one contender&#x27;s match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Turning Point, also involving Bobby Roode, preventing him from receiving another title opportunity until Bound for Glory 2013 as per the pre-match stipulation. On December 9 at Final Resolution, Styles was defeated by Christopher Daniels in what was billed as their &quot;final match&quot;. On the following episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Styles said that he was tired of doing the right thing and that he was going to do his own thing from there on.

Beginning in February 2013, TNA began airing videos at Styles&#x27; home interviewing his wife, a friend, and even attempting to interview Styles himself before he angrily forced them to leave. Styles, now sporting a beard, unkempt hair, and all-black attire, returned to TNA with the &quot;Calf Killer&quot; submission hold as his new finisher, which he used to defeat James Storm in his first match back. Styles, who remained silent in the following weeks, began feuding with Kurt Angle after refusing to tell Angle whether or not he was with the Aces &amp; Eights stable. His new gimmick was nicknamed &quot;The Lone Wolf&quot;, since he rejected joining Aces &amp; Eights. At Slammiversary XI, Styles was defeated by Angle in a singles match, but he defeated him in a rematch to earn the final spot in the 2013 Bound for Glory Series. Throughout the following weeks, Styles participated in the Bound For Glory Series, winning the tournament and becoming the number one contender for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Bound for Glory. The following week on &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Styles claimed that he was no longer under contract with TNA and insulted Dixie Carter, who responded by saying that Styles was not a great wrestler. In the weeks leading up to Bound for Glory, Styles continued to appear on &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, despite not having a contract with the company, but he would defeat Bully Ray at Bound for Glory, despite interference from Aces &amp; Eights and Carter, to win his second TNA World Heavyweight Championship and fifth world title in the company overall. Styles made his first televised title defense on the following episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, defeating Ray in a rematch after interference from Mr. Anderson, after which he refused Carter&#x27;s new contract offer and walked out of TNA with the title. On October 29, TNA vacated the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On the December 2 taping of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; which aired on January 2, 2014, Styles returned to TNA with his championship to confront Carter and Magnus (who had won a tournament to crown the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion), with Styles challenging Magnus to a title unification match on next weeks episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, which Magnus accepted. On December 5 taping of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; which aired on tape delay on January 9, Magnus won to unify both titles after interference from eight other wrestlers on Magnus&#x27; behalf and Sting interfering on Styles&#x27; behalf in what would be Styles&#x27; final match with TNA. On December 8, it was reported that contract negotiations between Styles and TNA had broken down and that Styles would be leaving the promotion, becoming a free agent effective December 17 and ending his near twelve-year association with the company. According to Styles he left the promotion since they made him an offer which reduced his salary about 60%.

At the end of the show, Styles proceeded to join Bullet Club in a group hug, mirroring the famous 1996 WWF Madison Square Garden &quot;Curtain Call&quot;.

=== Second return to the independent circuit (2014–2016) ===

Following his departure from TNA, Styles would begin taking independent bookings for the first time in two years, accepting as many dates as possible and more regularly. During his second run on the independent circuit, he competed in various countries around the world, most notably England.

On March 1, 2014, Styles made an appearance for English promotion Preston City Wrestling, losing to British wrestler Lionheart in the main event.

=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (2014–2016) ===
For the first time since the TNA-NJPW partnership in 2008, on March 27, 2014, it was reported that Styles would return to New Japan Pro-Wrestling and had signed a contract with the company. Styles&#x27; return came on April 6 at Invasion Attack, where he attacked IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kazuchika Okada after his match and laid him out with the &quot;Styles Clash&quot; and challenged Okada to a title match, before revealing himself as the newest member of Bullet Club, establishing himself as a villain in the process. Following Invasion Attack, with Styles still working a full schedule on the American independent circuit and only booked to work NJPW&#x27;s larger events, Karl Anderson was positioned as the new leader of Bullet Club. However, Styles was considered the leader of the Ring of Honor (ROH) version of Bullet Club, a role which was also given to him by NJPW by the end of 2015. Styles wrestled his first match under a New Japan contract on May 3 at Wrestling Dontaku, where he defeated Okada with help from Yujiro Takahashi to become the new IWGP Heavyweight Champion. With this victory, Styles became the sixth &quot;gaijin&quot; (non-Japanese) champion in the title&#x27;s history and the first American champion since Brock Lesnar in 2005. The win also made Styles the shortest IWGP Heavyweight Champion in history. On May 17, Styles made his first successful title defense in a three-way match with Okada and Michael Elgin at the NJPW/ROH co-produced War of the Worlds event in New York City. On May 25 at Back to the Yokohama Arena, Styles defeated Okada for his second successful title defense. Styles suffered his first loss in NJPW on July 21, when he was defeated by Okada in his first match in the 2014 G1 Climax tournament. Out of his nine remaining matches in the tournament, Styles lost only one, but failed to advance to the finals due to his loss against Okada in the head-to-head match. On October 13 at King of Pro-Wrestling, Styles lost the IWGP Heavyweight Championship to Hiroshi Tanahashi in his third defense, after the returning Yoshitatsu stopped Bullet Club&#x27;s newest member, Jeff Jarrett, from interfering in the match.
On November 8 at Power Struggle, Styles defeated Yoshitatsu with help from Jarrett and after the match was confronted by Tetsuya Naito. During the match, Yoshitatsu legitimately broke his neck on a botched &quot;Styles Clash&quot; in which he tucked his head, leading to NJPW pushing Styles as a &quot;killer&quot; and the &quot;Styles Clash&quot; as a controversial maneuver. Later in the month, Styles entered the 2014 World Tag League, alongside Yujiro Takahashi. Despite a win over the reigning IWGP Tag Team Champions, Bullet Club stablemates Doc Gallows and Karl Anderson, Styles and Takahashi failed to advance from their block with a record of four wins and three losses due to losing to Kazuchika Okada and Yoshi-Hashi on the final day. Styles and Naito faced off in a match on January 4, 2015, at Wrestle Kingdom 9 in Tokyo Dome, where Styles was victorious. On January 6, 2015, Styles inserted himself back into the IWGP Heavyweight Championship picture, when he pinned Tanahashi in an eight-man tag team match, setting up a title match between the two at The New Beginning in Osaka. On February 11, Styles defeated Tanahashi to win the IWGP Heavyweight Championship for the second time. Styles made his first title defense on April 5 at Invasion Attack, where he defeated 2015 New Japan Cup winner Kota Ibushi. His five-month reign ended in his second defense on July 5 at Dominion 7.5 in Osaka-jo Hall, where he was defeated by Kazuchika Okada. From July 20 to August 14, Styles took part in the 2015 G1 Climax. Styles entered the final day with a chance to advance from his block, but a loss against Hiroshi Tanahashi cost him a spot in the finals, giving him a record of six wins and three losses. On October 12 at King of Pro-Wrestling, Styles received a rematch for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, but was again defeated by Okada.

In November, Styles entered the IWGP Intercontinental Championship picture by challenging Shinsuke Nakamura to a title match. Later that month, Styles was forced to pull out of the 2015 World Tag League, where he teamed with Yujiro Takahashi, after experiencing a back injury. Styles returned to the NJPW ring on January 4, 2016, at Wrestle Kingdom 10 in Tokyo Dome, where he unsuccessfully challenged Shinsuke Nakamura for the IWGP Intercontinental Championship. Hours after Styles&#x27; Wrestle Kingdom 10 match, it was reported that Styles had given his notice to NJPW on the morning of January 4, announcing that he was leaving the promotion and signing with WWE. The following day, Styles made his final appearance for NJPW, where the rest of Bullet Club turned on him with Kenny Omega becoming the stable&#x27;s new leader.

=== WWE (2016–present) ===
==== Feud with John Cena (2016–2017) ====
After weeks of speculation and WWE themselves covering the rumors of Styles leaving NJPW for WWE, on January 20, 2016, it was confirmed that he had signed with WWE. Prior to signing, Styles had also had extensive discussions with TNA and according to them, Styles had agreed to return to the promotion with Bullet Club stablemates Doc Gallows and Karl Anderson, before being offered a &quot;blow-away deal&quot; by WWE. After not being on WWE television since his &quot;Metal&quot; match in 2002, Styles made his re-debut in WWE on January 24 at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view during the Royal Rumble match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, entering at number three. Styles went on to eliminate Curtis Axel and Tyler Breeze, before being eliminated by Kevin Owens, lasting just under 29 minutes in the match. Styles then entered a storyline with Chris Jericho, with the two exchanging victories on both &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot;, which ultimately led to an encounter between the two on February 21 at Fastlane, where Styles emerged victorious via submission. After Fastlane, Jericho and Styles formed a tag team, dubbed &quot;Y2AJ&quot;, and defeated The New Day (Big E and Kofi Kingston) in two non-title matches. Y2AJ failed to win the WWE Tag Team Championship from them on the March 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, after which Jericho turned on Styles and attacked him, ending their team. The two subsequently interfered in each other&#x27;s matches, leading to a match between the two at WrestleMania 32 on April 3, which Styles lost.

On the following episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Styles defeated Jericho, Kevin Owens, and Cesaro in a fatal four-way match to become the number one contender for Roman Reigns&#x27; WWE World Heavyweight Championship. In the weeks that followed, Styles reunited with former Bullet Club stablemates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson (now known as The Club), and an alliance was teased, which Styles initially declined. At Payback on May 1, Reigns eventually defeated Styles by pinfall after the match was restarted twice (with Styles first winning by countout and then by disqualification), despite Gallows and Anderson&#x27;s interference. He received a rematch against Reigns at Extreme Rules on May 22 in an Extreme Rules match, but was unsuccessful in winning the championship due to interference from both Gallows and Anderson and The Usos (Jey and Jimmy Uso).

On the May 30 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Styles welcomed back a returning John Cena, only to attack Cena with help from Gallows and Anderson, turning heel in the process. This set up a match between Styles and Cena at Money in the Bank on June 19, which Styles won after interference from The Club. At Battleground on July 24, The Club were defeated by Cena and Enzo Amore and Big Cass in a six-man tag team match after Cena pinned Styles. During the 2016 WWE Draft, Styles was drafted to the SmackDown brand in the first round of picks, being the brand&#x27;s second pick overall, while Gallows and Anderson were drafted to the Raw brand, splitting up The Club. He faced Cena once more at the SummerSlam pay-per-view on August 21, where he was victorious. After his victory over Cena, Styles claimed himself to be the &quot;new face of WWE&quot; and &quot;the Face That Runs the Place&quot;.
Due to his victory at SummerSlam, Styles immediately re-entered the renamed WWE World Championship picture and received another opportunity at the title at Backlash against Dean Ambrose. At Backlash on September 11, Styles defeated Ambrose to become the WWE World Champion for the first time after a low blow, also his first championship in WWE and eighth world title overall. Styles made his first successful title defense against Ambrose in a rematch on the September 27 episode of &quot;SmackDown Live&quot; after interference from Cena.

== Legacy ==
In a 2016 article, &quot;Pro Wrestling Torch&quot; journalist Michael Moore noted that Styles &quot;has long been regarded as one of the best wrestlers in the world&quot;. In November 2012, &quot;IGN UK&quot; columnist Matt Fowler ranked Styles at number 38 in his top 50 professional wrestlers of all-time list. Luke Winkie of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; listed him as the 46th greatest wrestler of all time in 2016, noting that: &quot;Honestly, in a couple years it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if A.J. belongs in the top 20.&quot;

Ayub Nouinou, a columnist for &quot;The Independent&quot;, described him as the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of TNA for more than a decade, before &quot;applying his craft&quot; for NJPW and ROH, among others. Nouinou went on to state that Styles had &quot;established himself as one of the best talents on the planet over the last two years (2014 and 2015)&quot; and noted that pertaining to Styles&#x27; 2016 WWE signing &quot;the addition of Styles would have to be considered one of the greatest signings since the turn of the millennium&quot;. Finally, Nouinou made the prediction that &quot;Styles can be the superstar that spearheads WWE into a new era&quot;. Josh Barnett, a columnist for &quot;USA Today&quot;, stated in March 2017 that Styles &quot;could be considered the MVP of WWE over the last year&quot;. Barnett also added that in 2016 Styles had &quot;some of the WWE&#x27;s best matches, including multiple matches against John Cena and Roman Reigns&quot;, while also noting that he &quot;is considered one of the rare performers who can have a great match with anyone&quot;. By late 2021, Philip Lindsey of Bleacher Report wrote that Styles was considered &quot;one of the best in-ring competitors in the world. Many top stars have had some of their most memorable matches opposite this high-flying technician.&quot;

Many of Styles&#x27; peers have praised him as being one of the greatest in-ring performers. Kurt Angle named him as the best wrestler that he ever wrestled, calling him a &quot;rare breed&quot;. Stone Cold Steve Austin dubbed Styles &quot;the best wrestler on two feet&quot;, while The Undertaker, whom Styles faced in his retirement match, described him as &quot;probably the best in the business... [the] closest to Shawn Michaels that there is.&quot; The comparison to Shawn Michaels was also made by renowned professional wrestling promoter and manager Paul Heyman, who stated that: &quot;He&#x27;s everything that Shawn Michaels, and Bret Hart, and Ric Flair were to their generation and he&#x27;s updated it. He&#x27;s evolved their styles to truly be the single most phenomenal in-ring performer I have ever had the honour and the pleasure of watching up close&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Jones has been married to school teacher Wendy since 2000. They have three sons: Ajay Covell Jones (born May 3, 2005), Avery Jones (born February 14, 2007), and Albey Jones (born September 15, 2009), and a daughter, Anney Jones (born October 8, 2014). Their first son&#x27;s middle name was taken from the last name of Jones&#x27; best friend and fellow wrestler Christopher Daniels, whose real name is Daniel Covell. In 2010, Jones acquired a large tattoo down the right side of his torso which reads &quot;AJ 05-03-05 02-14-07 09-15-09&quot;, representing his initials and birth dates of his first three children. In 2016, he added the birth date of his fourth child, reading &quot;10-08-14&quot;. The family lives in Gainesville, Georgia.

Jones is a devout Christian, stating that in his life, &quot;It&#x27;s God first and family second.&quot; He is a big fan of Christian hip hop music, and his favorite groups to listen to are the West Coast-based K2S, Lil&#x27; Raskull, FTF, and L.G. Wise. While Jones was working for TNA, he met GRITS members Stacey &quot;Coffee&quot; Jones and Teron &quot;Bonafide&quot; Carter at Universal Studios Florida, TNA&#x27;s former primary television taping location. Jones would become good friends with the duo, using their remix of his entrance music &quot;I Am&quot;, later renamed &quot;Get Ready to Fly&quot;).

Jones has been accused throughout his career of being homophobic and being prejudiced against LGBTQ+ people due to him using the anti-gay slur &quot;faggot&quot; on numerous occasions. NWA had part of a segment of which Jones was a part for NWA TNA bleeped out due to him using inappropriate language, particularly his using the slur at Disco Inferno. &quot;Road Dogg&quot; Jesse James, who was then known as BJ James, also used the slur during another show but not at Inferno. No consequences were taken at Jones by management, but he did apologize stating that the slur &quot;is a word you just say when you&#x27;re when goofing off.&quot; At a 2005 Ring of Honor show, Styles used the slur against an audience member during a match against CIMA. During a backstage cut during a Pro Wrestling Guerrilla show, he interrupted a promo from Kevin Steen (later Kevin Owens) and used the slur against him; he also referred to an opponent&#x27;s manager during a 2015 show as a &quot;douchebag with a faggity bow tie&quot;, telling him afterward to &quot;find a life partner and get out of here before [he gets] hurt&quot;.

<text>Leslie Ferdinand&quot;Buster&quot;Narum (November 16, 1940 – May 17, 2004) was an American professional baseball player. Listed as tall and , he was a right-handed starting pitcher in Major League Baseball for the Baltimore Orioles () and Washington Senators (–).

Born in Philadelphia, Narum graduated from high school in Clearwater, Florida. He signed with Baltimore at age 17 in 1958 and debuted with the Orioles early in the season, finishing with no decisions in nine innings of work. The next year, he was sent to the Senators in the same trade that brought Lou Piniella to Baltimore. On May 3, 1963, Narum became the first-ever Oriole player to hit a home run in his first Major League at-bat, connecting off Don Mossi of the Detroit Tigers in an 8–5 Baltimore triumph.

Narum had a career batting average of .059 (7-for-118), though three of Narum&#x27;s seven lifetime hits were home runs.

In 96 career games Narum compiled a 14–27 record, with 220 strikeouts, a 4.45 ERA, two shutouts, and nine complete games in 396 innings pitched. He allowed 398 hits and 177 bases on balls.

Buster Narum died in Clearwater at the age of 63.

<doc id="745073" wikidata="Q1129327" url="?curid=745073" title="Fête de la Musique">
<text>The Fête de la Musique, also known in English as Music Day, Make Music Day, or World Music Day, is an annual music celebration that takes place on 21 June. On Music Day, citizens and residents are urged to play music outside in their neighborhoods or in public spaces and parks. Free concerts are also organized, where musicians play for fun and not for payment.

The first all-day musical celebration on the day of the summer solstice was originated by Jack Lang, then Minister of Culture of France, as well as by Maurice Fleuret; it was celebrated in Paris in 1982. Music Day later became celebrated in 120 countries around the world.

==History==
In October 1981, Maurice Fleuret became Director of Music and Dance at the French Ministry of Culture at Jack Lang&#x27;s request. He applied his reflections to the musical practice and its evolution: &quot;the music everywhere and the concert nowhere&quot;. When he discovered, in a 1982 study on the cultural habits of the French, that five million people, one young person out of two, played a musical instrument, he began to dream of a way to bring people out on the streets. It first took place in 1982 in Paris as the Fête de la Musique.

Ever since, the festival has become an international phenomenon, celebrated on the same day in more than 700 cities in 120 countries, including India, Germany, Italy, Greece, Russia, Australia, Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, Canada, the United States, the UK, and Japan. 

In the Anglosphere, the day has become known as Music Day, Make Music Day and World Music Day.

==Purpose==
Fête de la Musique&#x27;s purpose is to promote music. Amateur and professional musicians are encouraged to perform in the streets, under the slogan &quot;Faites de la musique&quot; (&quot;Make music&quot;), a homophone of &quot;Fête de la musique&quot;. Thousands of free concerts are staged throughout the day, making all genres of music accessible to the public. 

In France, all concerts must be free to the public, and all performers donate their time free of charge. This is true of most participating cities as well.

==In France==
Despite there being a large tolerance by the general public about the performance of music by amateurs in public areas after the usual hours, noise restrictions still apply and can cause some establishments to be forbidden to remain open and broadcast music out of their doors without prior authorization. This means that the prefectures in France can still forbid individuals, groups, or establishments to install any audio hardware in the street.

==Reach and impact==
 there were 120 countries participating in Fête de la Musique, and over 1,000 cities participated across the world in that year. In 2023, events were held on most continents.

Italy&#x27;s &quot;Festa della Musica&quot; began in 1985, and became national in 1994. 

The UK Event began as National Music Day in 1992. Make Music Day UK became an independent organization in 2022.

Ukraine has held the event in Lviv since 2013, and it has continued despite the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In the United States, the Make Music Alliance was formed in 2014 to help coordinate efforts across the country. In 2023 there were 4,791 free concerts held across 117 U.S. cities, with over 100 in Cincinnati, Madison, New York City, Philadelphia, and Salem. 

In Australia, Make Music Day Australia was initiated in 2018 by the Australian Music Association (AMA), and as of 2022 was co-hosted by the AMA and National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM). In 2023, a huge international project called &quot;Make Music, Make Friends&quot; partnered 10 Australian schools with schools around the world to share music and greet one another on Make Music Day.

Turkiye and Ghana held their first Make Music Days in 2022, and South Africa in 2023.

<text>Edward Frank &quot;Moe&quot; Burtschy (April 18, 1922 – May 2, 2004) was an American right-handed relief pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played for the Philadelphia / Kansas City Athletics (1950, 1951, 1954–56). He was listed as tall and .

He was born in Cincinnati. After graduating from high school in 1940, Burtschy signed a minor league contract, but he joined the Navy in September 1940 and served aboard the . Following his military service, he returned to the minors in 1946, and, on June 17, 1950, he made his debut in the American League with the Athletics. Burtschy made the only start of his MLB career that year on August 1 against the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park; he allowed seven hits and six earned runs in 2 innings pitched, and absorbed the 8–1 defeat, his only big-league decision of the 1950 season. He missed much of the 1951 season with elbow surgery, and was assigned to Triple-A for all of 1952 and 1953.

He then spent all of with the Athletics, his only full year in the majors. In 46 games pitched, tied for fifth in the American League, Burtschy won five, lost four, and notched four saves for the 54th and last Philadelphia Athletics team. In one unusual appearance, on June 26, 1954, Burtschy replaced Dutch Romberger in the tenth inning of an Athletics game against the Baltimore Orioles. He walked Chuck Diering intentionally to load the bases. He then pitched wildly to Gil Coan who scored Dick Kryhoski with the winning run.

After two victories in seven relief stints in April and early May, Burtschy was optioned to the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League by the relocated Kansas City Athletics in May , and he posted an effective 3.02 earned run average in 29 games to earn another audition with parent Kansas City for . He put up a 3–1 record in 21 games during the season&#x27;s early weeks, hurling for a second-division team. On May 29, 1956, he pitched two innings of hitless relief against the White Sox, then fell apart in the 12th, yielding three walks and a sacrifice to give Chicago a 7–4 win. His last appearance for the Athletics came on June 9; despite facing the minimum of three batters and holding Baltimore off the scoreboard, he allowed two hits, but each Oriole baserunner was erased caught stealing on throws from Athletics&#x27; catcher Joe Ginsberg. Five days later, he was traded with outfielder Bill Renna to the New York Yankees in a four-player deal that brought veteran first baseman Eddie Robinson back to the Athletics. The Yankees sent Burtschy back to Triple-A, where he played for two years before retiring from the game.

In his 90-game MLB career, Burtschy compiled a 10–6 record, with 97 strikeouts, a 4.71 ERA, and four saves in 185 innings pitched. After retiring, he worked as a freight salesman in the trucking industry.

In November 1999 Burtschy joined Lou Limmer, Gus Zernial, Forrest &quot;Spook&quot; Jacobs, Joe Astroth, Art Ditmar and Joe DeMaestri for a reunion of members of the 1954 Philadelphia Athletics. The event was organized by the Philadelphia Athletics Historical Society.

Moe Burtschy died of heart failure in Delhi Township, Ohio at the age of 82.

The name comes from the Nisenan Native Americans name for the valley in which Coloma is located: &quot;Cullumah&quot;, meaning &#x27;beautiful.&#x27; Coloma is on the South Fork American River that runs through the valley and was built on the original Indian village of Koloma. Former spellings include &quot;Colluma&quot; and &quot;Culloma&quot;.

==History==
Coloma grew around Sutter&#x27;s Mill following the finding of gold. A post office was established in 1849 under the name Culloma, changing to Coloma in 1851.

One of Coloma&#x27;s earliest settlers was Silas Sanderson (1824–1886), who went on to become the 7th Chief Justice of California. Another was Nancy Gooch, who was one of the first black women to succeed in California.

==Ghost town==

While some people still live in the area, Coloma is considered something of a ghost town because civic buildings such as the jail have been abandoned and left to decay, and other buildings from its boom era (1847–1852) have been converted into museums and other historical displays. The tailrace of Sutter&#x27;s Mill remains, as does a nearby reconstruction.

In reality the meaningfulness of the township of Coloma has dissipated as residents who live in the wider Coloma Valley area generally share a community spirit.

The local economy is based predominantly on agriculture and tourism. Of particular note is the rafting industry as the South Fork American River is one of the most popular white-water trips in North America.

<doc id="745082" wikidata="Q454088" url="?curid=745082" title="Lee Majors">
<text>Lee Majors (born Harvey Lee Yeary; April 23, 1939) is an American actor. He portrayed the characters of Heath Barkley on the American television Western series &quot;The Big Valley&quot; (1965–1969), Colonel Steve Austin on the American television science-fiction action series &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; (1973–1978), and Colt Seavers on the American television action series &quot;The Fall Guy&quot; (1981–1986).

==Early life==
Majors was born in Wyandotte, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. His parents, Carl and Alice Yeary, were both killed in separate accidents. (His father died in a work accident five months prior to his birth, and his mother was killed in a car accident when he was almost seventeen months old.) At the age of two, Majors was adopted by his uncle and aunt, Harvey and Mildred Yeary, and he moved with them to Middlesboro, Kentucky.

He participated in track and football at Middlesboro High School. He graduated in 1957, and earned a scholarship to Indiana University, where he again competed in sports. Majors transferred to Eastern Kentucky University in Richmond, Kentucky, in 1959. He played in his first football game the following year, but suffered a severe back injury which left him paralyzed for two weeks and ruined his college athletic career. Following his injury, he turned his attention to acting and performed in plays at the Pioneer Playhouse in Danville, Kentucky. Majors graduated from Eastern Kentucky in 1962 with a degree in history and physical education. He planned to be a football coach.

After college, he received an offer to try out for the St. Louis Cardinals football team. Instead, he moved to Los Angeles and found work at the Los Angeles Park and Recreation Department as the recreation director for North Hollywood Park. In Los Angeles, Majors met many actors and industry professionals, including Dick Clayton, who had been James Dean&#x27;s agent, and Clayton suggested he attend his acting school. After one year of acting school, Clayton felt that Majors was ready to start his career. At this time, he picked up the stage name Lee Majors as a tribute to childhood hero Johnny Majors who was a player and future coach for the University of Tennessee. Majors also studied at Estelle Harman&#x27;s acting school at MGM.

==Career==

===Early roles===
Majors landed his first, although uncredited, role in &quot;Strait-Jacket&quot; (1964), in a flashback sequence as Joan Crawford&#x27;s cheating husband. After appearing in a 1965 episode of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, he starred later that year as Howard White in an episode of &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;, &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Paw – A Retelling&quot;, based on the short story by W. W. Jacobs.

Majors got his big break when he was chosen out of over 400 young actors, including Burt Reynolds, for the co-starring role of Heath Barkley in a new ABC/ Four Star Western series, &quot;The Big Valley&quot;, which starred Barbara Stanwyck. Also starring on the show was another newcomer, Linda Evans, who played Heath&#x27;s younger sister, Audra. Richard Long and Peter Breck, (who himself had previously starred in &quot;Black Saddle&quot; for Four Star) played his brothers Jarrod and Nick, respectively. One of Heath&#x27;s frequently used expressions during the series was &quot;Boy howdy!&quot; During the series, Majors co-starred in the 1968 Charlton Heston film &quot;Will Penny&quot;, for which he received an &quot;Introducing&quot; credit, and landed the lead role in &quot;The Ballad of Andy Crocker&quot; (1969), a made-for-television film which was first broadcast by ABC. The film was one of the first films to deal with the subject matter of Vietnam veterans &quot;coming home&quot;. That same year, he was offered the chance to star in &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; (1969), but when &quot;The Big Valley&quot; was renewed, he declined the role (which later went to Jon Voight). When &quot;The Big Valley&quot; was cancelled in 1969, he signed a long-term contract with Universal Studios. In 1970, Majors appeared in William Wyler&#x27;s final film &quot;The Liberation of L.B. Jones&quot;, and joined the cast of &quot;The Virginian&quot; for its final season when the show was restructured as &quot;The Men from Shiloh&quot; featuring four alternating leads. Majors played new ranch hand Roy Tate.

Majors was called a &quot;blond Elvis Presley&quot; because of his resemblance to Elvis during this period of his career.

===1970s: &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;===
In 1971, he landed the role of Arthur Hill&#x27;s partner, Jess Brandon, on &quot;Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law&quot;, which garnered critical acclaim during its three seasons on ABC.

Majors&#x27;s co-starring role on &quot;Owen Marshall&quot; led him to a starring role as United States Air Force Colonel Steve Austin, an ex-astronaut with bionic implants in &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;, a 1973 television film broadcast on ABC. In 1974, the network decided to turn it into a weekly series. The series became an international success, being screened in over 70 countries, turning Majors into a pop icon. Majors also made his directorial debut in 1975, on an episode called &quot;One of Our Running Backs Is Missing&quot; which co-starred professional football players such as Larry Csonka and Dick Butkus.

In 1977, with &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; still a hit series, Majors tried to renegotiate his contract with Universal Television. The studio in turn filed a lawsuit to force him to report to work due to stipulations within his existing contract that had not yet expired. It was rumored that Majors was holding out for more money, but his manager denied this: according to him, Majors was fighting to have his own production company, Fawcett Majors Productions, brought on as an independent producer in association with Universal in order to make the company viable. After Majors did not report to work that June, studio executives ultimately relented. However, ratings began to decline and &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; was cancelled in 1978 (as was &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;). In November 2010, Time-Life released a 40 DVD set featuring every episode and bonus features from the show.

He also appeared in several films during the 1970s. The television film &quot;Francis Gary Powers: The True Story of the U-2 Spy Incident&quot; (1976, as Francis Gary Powers), the Viking film &quot;The Norseman&quot; (1978) co-starring Cornel Wilde, the horror thriller &quot;Killer Fish&quot; (1979), the drama &quot;Steel&quot; (1979), which he produced, co-starring Jennifer O&#x27;Neill and Art Carney, and the political thriller &quot;Agency&quot; (1980), starring Robert Mitchum.

===1980s: &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;===
In 1981, Majors returned in another long-running television series. Producer Glen A. Larson (who had first worked with Majors on &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;, in which Majors guest starred, and later on &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;) asked him to star in the &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;. Majors played Colt Seavers, a Hollywood stuntman who moonlights as a bounty hunter. Majors also sang its theme song, the self-effacing &quot;The Unknown Stuntman.&quot; The show was a hit, and as one of the producers, Majors invited many of his former co-stars, including Linda Evans, Peter Breck, Lindsay Wagner, Richard Anderson, Stewart Granger, Doug McClure, James Drury, and Buddy Hackett to appear in various episodes. The series ran for five seasons and ended in 1986.

His 1980s films include the made-for-TV sequel &quot;High Noon, Part II: The Return of Will Kane&quot; (1980), playing Gary Cooper&#x27;s original role, the science fiction film &quot;The Last Chase&quot; (1981), and the disaster film &quot;&quot; (1983). Between 1987 and 1994, Majors, Wagner, and Anderson made three &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;/&quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; television films. Majors also made cameo appearances in &quot;Circle of Two&quot; (1980) and as himself in the 1988 holiday comedy &quot;Scrooged&quot;.

===1990s–present===

In 1990, he starred in the film &quot;Keaton&#x27;s Cop&quot;, and had recurring roles in &quot;Tour of Duty&quot; and the short-lived 1992 series, &quot;Raven&quot;. He also had supporting roles in the films &quot;Trojan War&quot; (1997), &quot;Out Cold&quot; (2001), &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot; (2002), and &quot;The Brothers Solomon&quot; (2007). He voiced the character of &quot;Big&quot; Mitch Baker in the 2002 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;. He played Jaret Reddick&#x27;s disconnected father in Bowling For Soup&#x27;s 2007 video, &quot;When We Die&quot;. That same year, he played Grandpa Max in &quot;Ben 10: Race Against Time&quot;, and voiced a character on the APTN animated children&#x27;s program &quot;Wapos Bay: The Series&quot; that was named &quot;Steve from Austin&quot;.

Majors played Coach Ross on the CW Network television series &quot;The Game&quot;, which ran from October 1, 2006, to May 20, 2009.

Majors appeared in the role of God in &quot;Jim Almighty&quot; a 2007 episode of &quot;According to Jim&quot;. He later returned to the role in that show&#x27;s 2009 series finale, &quot;Heaven Opposed to Hell&quot;. Also in 2008, Majors played a member of the Minutemen (dedicated to preventing illegal border crossings) in season four of the Showtime series &quot;Weeds&quot;, where he recruits Kevin Nealon&#x27;s character. Majors reprised his role (voice only) as Col. Steve Austin in the &quot;Bionic Woman&quot; segment of the &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; season four episode &quot;Love, Maurice&quot; (2009).

In March 2010, Majors played the crusty sailing instructor in the &quot;Community&quot; episode &quot;Beginner Pottery&quot;. In April 2010, he appeared as the mentor of the series lead in &quot;Christopher Chance&quot;, the 12th episode of &quot;Human Target&quot;. Later that year, he provided the voice of General Abernathy in &quot;G.I. Joe: Renegades&quot;. He later reprised the role in a 2011 episode. In 2011, he appeared as &quot;Rockwell&quot; in &quot;Jerusalem Countdown&quot;. From 2011 to 2014 he appeared in three episodes of the Fox comedy &quot;Raising Hope&quot;, as Burt&#x27;s father, Ralph. On February 1, 2013, it was announced that Majors would appear in a two-episode guest spot in season two of TNT&#x27;s &quot;Dallas&quot; as Ken Richards, an old flame of Sue Ellen&#x27;s. In 2015, he appeared as J.D. in the faith-based drama &quot;Do You Believe?&quot; and the hip-hop dance-themed series &quot;Avengers of eXtreme Illusions&quot;. Majors appeared in the second and third seasons of &quot;Ash vs Evil Dead&quot; as Brock Williams, the father of Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell). In late 2018, Majors voiced an animated &quot;Six Million Dollar Man&quot; action figure in an advertisement for Honda&#x27;s &quot;Happy Honda Days&quot; sale event. In 2019, Majors voiced Jeff Tracy in &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot;.

===Popular culture===
The song &quot;Midnight Train to Georgia&quot; was inspired by Lee Majors and Farrah Fawcett. Songwriter Jim Weatherly phoned his friend Majors one day, and the call was answered by Fawcett. Weatherly and Fawcett chatted briefly and she told him she was going to visit her mother and was taking &quot;the midnight plane to Houston.&quot; Although Majors and Fawcett were both successful by that time, Weatherly used them as &quot;characters&quot; in his song about a failed actress who leaves Los Angeles, and is followed by her boyfriend who cannot live without her. Eventually the genders were swapped, the plane became a train, and Houston was changed to Georgia. The recording by Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips went to number one in 1973.

In the 1994 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Burns&#x27; Heir&quot;, Marge Simpson fantasizes about running off with Majors.

The title of the Beastie Boys song &quot;Lee Majors Come Again&quot; is a reference to Majors.

<text>Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Volkov (; born 27 May 1948) is a retired Soviet cosmonaut. He is a veteran of 3 space flights, including twice to the Mir Soviet space station, and is the father of cosmonaut Sergey Volkov.

==Biography and career==
Volkov was born in Ukrainian SSR in a family of Russian ethnicity. At the age of 13, Volkov witnessed Yuri Gagarin become the first man in space and this inspired him to become a cosmonaut. He joined the Soviet space programme and became a test pilot before realising his dream.

He flew into space three times. His first spaceflight was a trip to Salyut 7 in 1985 (64 days in space), followed by two flights to the Mir space station, in 1988–1989 (151 days) and again in 1991–1992 (175 days) as commander of flight Soyuz TM-13. On board the Mir space station, he controlled the docking procedures among other things.

The Soviet Union broke up in 1991 during his second stay on board Mir. At the time Volkov was orbiting Earth on Mir with Sergei K. Krikalev, &quot;the last citizens of the USSR&quot;. Having gone into orbit as Soviet citizens, they returned to Earth as Russian citizens.

He worked as Commander of the Cosmonaut Team at the Cosmonauts Training Centre from January 1991 until August 1998. His work was to prepare Russian and foreign cosmonauts for future flights to space stations to Mir and the International Space Station.

He is the father of Sergey Volkov. The younger Volkov became the first second-generation cosmonaut when he was launched aboard Soyuz TMA-12 on 8 April 2008, his first of three flights; in total he spent over a year aboard the International Space Station.

==Awards==
Aleksandr Volkov was awarded:
* Hero of the Soviet Union (1985)
* Order of Lenin (1985)
* Order of the October Revolution (1989)
* Order of Friendship of Peoples (1992)
* Medal 2nd class of the Order of Merit for the Fatherland (1996)
* Medal &quot;For Merit in Space Exploration&quot; (2011)
* Officer of the Legion of Honour (France)
* Order of Merit 3rd class (Ukraine, 2011)

<doc id="745093" wikidata="Q3029071" url="?curid=745093" title="Hush (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)">
<text>&quot;Hush&quot; is the tenth episode in the fourth season of the supernatural drama television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1997–2003). It was written and directed by series creator Joss Whedon and originally aired in the United States on December 14, 1999, on The WB. After reading critical response to the series in which the dialogue was praised as the most successful aspect of the show, Whedon set out to write an episode almost completely devoid of speech. Only about 17 minutes of dialogue is presented in the entire 44 minutes of &quot;Hush&quot;.

In &quot;Hush&quot;, a group of fairytale ghouls named &quot;The Gentlemen&quot; come to town and steal everyone&#x27;s voices, leaving them unable to scream when The Gentlemen cut out their hearts. Buffy and her friends must communicate with one another silently as they try to discover why no one can speak and find whoever is murdering the townspeople. They must also find ways to express their feelings about each other and keep some semblance of control as the town descends into chaos.

The episode was highly praised when it aired and was the only episode in the entire series to be nominated for an Emmy Award in Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series; it also received a nomination for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single Camera Series (Michael Gershman). &quot;Hush&quot; addresses the limits and assets of language and communication and the disruption to society when communication breaks down. The Gentlemen are often counted as some of the series&#x27; most frightening villains, and the episode is frequently included on lists of the best of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;.

== Plot ==
During a college lecture where Professor Walsh is discussing the difference between language and communication, Buffy has a dream in which Riley kisses her. They are interrupted by a young girl holding a distinctive box, singing a cryptic rhyme about &quot;the Gentlemen&quot;. Riley and Buffy speak after class and they almost kiss, but are unable to stop talking. They leave when it becomes awkward. Buffy calls Giles to tell him of her dream and the details of the little girl&#x27;s rhyme. In the middle of Xander and Anya&#x27;s argument with each other over the meaning of their relationship, Giles asks Xander to allow Spike to stay over at his house, as Giles&#x27; girlfriend Olivia will be visiting him from London for a few days.

Meanwhile, Willow attends a meeting of the campus Wicca group, hoping to meet others who share her interest in studying witchcraft, but is disappointed when they only talk about bake sales. Willow raises the subject of spells but is chastised for pandering to the stereotype about witches performing magic. A shy woman in the group, Tara Maclay, starts to speak up to support Willow&#x27;s suggestion, but falls silent when the attention turns to her.

That night, as Sunnydale sleeps, white wisps float from each person&#x27;s mouth to a belfry, where they settle in the box from Buffy&#x27;s dream, as ghoulish skeletal figures with metal-toothed grins and impeccable black suits look on. In the morning, Buffy and Willow discover they are unable to speak and become visibly distressed; they soon discover that everybody is unable to speak. The group gathers at Giles&#x27; house, where they see that the news is reporting that Sunnydale is suffering from an epidemic of laryngitis. Buffy and Riley, each concerned that chaos will ensue, find each other attempting to keep order on the streets. Buffy does not know about Riley&#x27;s paramilitary role as an agent of the government-controlled, demon-capturing Initiative; he in turn is unaware that she is the Slayer. They exchange a look and then their first kiss, before parting to continue their efforts.

The next night, the ghouls leave the belfry and float into town accompanied by their straitjacketed, deformed minions. They knock on the door of a student. When he opens it, roused from sleeping, they hold him down and carve out his heart while he tries in vain to scream. At Giles&#x27; apartment, Olivia is frightened by one of the Gentlemen outside Giles&#x27; window. The following morning in a campus classroom, Giles uses a series of overhead transparencies to explain to the others that the Gentlemen steal the townspeople&#x27;s voices so no one can scream as they gather the hearts they need, and that folklore indicates that they have been vanquished before when a princess screamed: the only thing that will kill them is a live human voice.

On her own, Tara finds a spell to help the town get their voices back, and goes out to show it to Willow. On the way to Willow&#x27;s dorm she trips, turns around and sees the Gentlemen floating toward her. In Willow&#x27;s dorm she frantically knocks on doors which no one will open; the Gentlemen steadily pursue her. Willow hears Tara&#x27;s panicked knocking down the hall and exits her room as Tara sprints into her, sending them both tumbling. They lock themselves into a laundry room and try to barricade the door with a vending machine, but it is too heavy for them to move. Willow, injured, sits and concentrates on moving the machine with telekinesis; she fails, but Tara sees what she is doing. They clasp hands and the machine moves swiftly across the room, blocking the door.

On patrol, Riley notices shadows in the belfry and goes to investigate. Buffy finds two of the Gentlemen&#x27;s minions, kills one and runs after the other. Riley fights his way into the belfry and while he is embattled, Buffy crashes through a window to fight the Gentlemen. He turns to attack and finds himself face to face with Buffy; she sees him as an armed agent of the Initiative for the first time. When a minion aggressively holds her from behind, she sees and recognizes the box from her dream and gesticulates wildly for Riley to destroy it. When he does so, the stolen voices escape. With her voice returned, Buffy screams until the heads of the Gentlemen and their minions explode.

The next day, Tara tells Willow she is special and has significant power. Olivia tells Giles that she now believes that everything he told her about witchcraft and darkness is true and that she is scared by the experience. Riley comes to Buffy&#x27;s dorm room; they agree they &quot;have to talk,&quot; but then sit in silence.

==Production and writing==
Joss Whedon&#x27;s impetus to create &quot;Hush&quot; was his reaction to hearing that the primary reason behind &quot;Buffy&quot;&#x27;s success was the dialogue. He felt that he was stagnating as a director, turning into a &quot;hack&quot; by making formulaic episodes. Whedon tended to concentrate so much on the visual aspects of the series&#x27; production that he was chastised by Fox executives in earlier seasons. Thus, writing and producing &quot;Hush&quot; depended almost solely on visuals and not on dialogue, a prospect that Whedon found terrifying, worried that viewers would find the episode boring. Much like the fourth-season finale &quot;Restless&quot;—which consisted almost entirely of dream sequences—and the sixth season musical &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot;, Whedon was certain he would fail at attempting to present the show in such a novel way. Initially, this was to be the episode where Riley and Buffy have sex, and Whedon took comfort in that plan because he knew people would not mind the silence, but ultimately he decided it was too early for the characters to sleep together, and he scrapped the idea.

The Gentlemen, called the &quot;creepiest villains we&#x27;ve ever done&quot; by series writer Doug Petrie, were inspired by a nightmare Whedon had as a child, specifically one in which he was in bed and approached by a floating monster. Whedon fashioned The Gentlemen as something from a Brothers Grimm fairy tale, intending them to be frightening to children — monsters who carve out people&#x27;s hearts, smiling as they do so. &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, Pinhead from &quot;Hellraiser&quot;, and Mr. Burns from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; all served as physical models for The Gentlemen. Designing them with elegantly Victorian costume and demeanor, Whedon found their politeness and grace especially unsettling. Their metallic teeth were inspired by the intersection of Victorian culture with the height of the Industrial age, an era that Whedon considers &quot;classically creepy&quot;. For Buffy studies scholar Rhonda Wilcox, The Gentlemen and their straitjacket-wearing minions, who clumsily flap, gyrate, and crouch as they move, are representative of class disparity and patriarchy: The Gentlemen, with their Victorian suits, move effortlessly to accomplish what they set out to do while their minions, whom Whedon called &quot;footmen&quot;, do the &quot;dirty work&quot;.

Doug Jones, Camden Toy, Don W. Lewis, and Charlie Brumbly—the actors who played The Gentlemen—had previous experience performing as monsters and were professional mimes as well. This gave them an elegant grace, especially in their hand movements. Their floating effect was accomplished by suspending them from cranes with wires (digitally removed in post-production), or by pulling them on dollies. The cast found the actors in make-up and costume to be terrifying in broad daylight, and Whedon was so impressed with the physical movements of The Gentlemen that he admitted on the DVD commentary that his mocking of mimes in general &quot;went down about 40%&quot; after the episode was filmed.

As newcomers to the Scooby Gang, Tara Maclay and Giles&#x27; girlfriend Olivia (Phina Oruche) are inexperienced with monsters, and were brought in to express &quot;real childlike terror&quot;. Willow had, after three seasons, grown considerably more confident, having found her intellectual and emotional niche at college, and therefore was no longer evincing the terror she once had; Tara, shy, unsure of herself, and unaccustomed to such experiences, served to fill the gap that Willow&#x27;s maturing had created. According to Buffy essayist Patrick Shade, Tara&#x27;s and Olivia&#x27;s fear &quot;heighten(s) our sense of vulnerability and so make these scenes more frightening&quot;. Joss Whedon has said that one of his favorite shots in the episode is of Olivia&#x27;s frightened reaction to a Gentlemen floating by her window, leering in at her.

Tara became a regularly recurring character throughout the fourth, fifth and sixth seasons, eventually becoming Willow&#x27;s girlfriend in what would be the first long-term lesbian relationship in U.S. television. The writers decided to replace Seth Green, who played Oz, Willow&#x27;s lycanthropic boyfriend, after he announced that he would be leaving early in the fourth season. They were unaware at the time that the relationship between Willow and Tara would become romantic, but Benson&#x27;s performance and demeanor &quot;made up our minds for us&quot;, according to Whedon. The writers wanted to make the scene in which Tara and Willow move the vending machine by working together &quot;sensual and powerful&quot;, and &quot;a very empowering statement about love; that two people together can accomplish more than when they&#x27;re alone&quot;. Whedon considers the scene one of the &quot;most romantic images we&#x27;ve put on film&quot; in the course of the series. Benson and Hannigan&#x27;s chemistry was impressive enough that two episodes into Tara and Willow&#x27;s friendship Whedon took the actors aside and informed them the relationship would be turning romantic.

The episode is a tribute to the silent films that were played in theaters with musical accompaniment, and 27 minutes of it are entirely dialogue-free. Several types of music are used to express what is not being said; music acts as the narrator. During Giles&#x27; overhead presentation he plays a recorded version of Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27; &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;. Buffy and Riley&#x27;s love theme is presented for the first time when they kiss in this episode. This composition by Christophe Beck—who composed scores for &quot;Buffy&quot; regularly—pleased Joss Whedon more than the Buffy and Angel love theme. He considered the Buffy-Riley theme more adult, but a bit more strange and blue than the Buffy-Angel theme: a prediction of where the relationship between Buffy and Riley would go.

==Themes==
=== Language ===
&quot;Hush&quot; explores issues relating to the limits and benefits of language and communication. During the first act of the episode, the characters are presented as being overwhelmed by language that is misused, used as white noise, and employed as a means of avoiding truth. Many of the conversations between characters, even those that are seemingly insignificant to the episode&#x27;s plot or to the show&#x27;s overall history, deal in some way with various aspects or forms of communication. Whedon stated that he was unaware of how &quot;inevitably coherent&quot; this theme was until after the script was completed. Buffy and Riley are unable to act upon their attraction because they cannot stop babbling, primarily to keep their true identities concealed from each other, but also to avoid becoming closer emotionally. Xander is unable or unwilling to express what Anya means to him, and Anya, still new at interacting with humans, uses blunt, often rude language that distances herself from all the other characters. Giles desperately wants the others to stop talking. Willow considers the women in the Wicca group to be nonsensical, later complaining to Buffy &quot;Talk, all talk. Blah blah Gaia. Blah blah moon, menstrual lifeforce power thingy. You know after a couple sessions I was hoping we would get into something real, but...&quot; These pseudo conversations are what &quot;Buffy&quot; essayists Alice Jenkins and Susan Stuart refer to as &quot;locutionary acts&quot;: language that is formed to have meaning but does not engage the listener.

When finally faced with the loss of speech, the characters readily express what they feel. Buffy and Riley, after a series of eyebrow movements and simply mouthed questions, are able to kiss spontaneously. Xander&#x27;s actions are very clearly directed toward protecting Anya and punishing Spike for harming her, and likewise, within a matter of moments Anya&#x27;s doubts about how Xander feels about her have disappeared and she becomes instantly affectionate towards him again. Tara, who was overcome with shyness while speaking during the Wicca meeting, easily expresses courage when touching Willow, and Willow realizes she has finally found someone who understands and shares what she is seeking.

Without speech, the Scoobies resort to gestures or writing. Humorous misperceptions arise from this gesturing when, for example, Buffy mimes driving in a stake—as though killing a vampire—too close to her pelvis, causing the Scoobies to think she is suggesting masturbating to rid the town of The Gentlemen. In the belfry, while Buffy and Riley are fighting The Gentlemen, Buffy indicates that Riley should smash the box from her dream. He misunderstands and breaks a jar beside it, looks up and grins, awaiting Buffy&#x27;s approval. The clumsiness of the characters&#x27; gesturing is in direct contrast to the grace of The Gentlemen, who communicate easily through gestures and other visual signals. Their communication is simple and direct: nods, head tilts, and hand movements achieve exactly what they want them to. The Scoobies, however, are confused and accomplish the opposite of what they intend. When they are rendered silent they are also rendered useless, unsure of how to fight The Gentlemen. According to two &quot;Buffy&quot; essayists, part of the horror stemming from the arrival of The Gentlemen is the silence that makes the people of Sunnydale helpless, easy victims.

Jenkins and Stuart assert that through the loss of speech, the communication in &quot;Hush&quot; is transformed from the senseless locutionary to the perlocutionary: acts upon which ideas are conveyed into instant meaning and action. The scream uttered by Buffy to destroy The Gentlemen has severe implications for them although it has no real meaning. Even Tara&#x27;s writing down Willow&#x27;s room number before going to her dorm communicates that she has been thinking of Willow and wishes to find her. This act confirms to both Tara and the audience that she is interested in Willow.

=== Community ===
Although Sunnydale has long been familiar with demons and monsters who have inhabited the town and fed off its residents, in this episode the conventions by which societal functions are so disrupted by the unexplained silence that significant chaos results, enough to warrant both Riley and Buffy going on patrol to keep order. Buffy and Willow walk down a familiar street, arm-in-arm and easily startled, and see a bank closed and patrons running into a liquor store that is obviously open. The breakdown of order also causes sudden religious fervor; a group of people have gathered on the street to read the Bible (Revelation 15:1 is written on a signboard—an allusion to the seven angels with seven plagues as there are seven Gentlemen, according to author Nikki Stafford). Opportunistic capitalist fervor results in a man selling overpriced dry erase boards. Community, notes Patrick Shade (citing sociologist George Herbert Mead), consists of institutions such as language, religion, and economics. When one institution disappears, Sunnydale residents begin to depend more heavily on the others. Mostly, however, individuals are isolated from one another during the silence. Even the Scoobies find their bonds shaken, as they are unable to use the witty banter that has marked them as a group thus far. (This awkwardness extended even to the actors: the first silent scene the entire cast attempted was the Scoobies gathering in Giles&#x27; apartment following the discovery that all of Sunnydale&#x27;s denizens had lost their voices. It took several rehearsals as the scene came out mistimed, with all of the actors having trouble playing off one another without the use of verbal cues, or all pantomiming over one another.) Without a common language to fall back upon the Scoobies are forced to depend on their shared history to help them recover well enough to be able to take action.

The resolution to this isolation and ineffectiveness is speaking out: restoring the voices of the people of Sunnydale. Shade states that this facet of the episode gives it a political overtone. Noel Murray from &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; writes that the silence imposed by The Gentlemen is a metaphor for how evil spreads: &quot;When dissent is stifled, or people fail to tell the truth, or when we’re just distracted by other concerns, things can get out of hand.&quot; Authority figures in the series, such as the school principal, the mayor&#x27;s office, and the Sunnydale Police Department, repeatedly either abet the town&#x27;s endemic evil or choose not to hear about it. During &quot;Hush&quot;, at Giles&#x27; apartment the Scoobies listen to a newscaster reporting that authorities in the town attribute the silence to a flu vaccine gone awry, causing mass laryngitis. Wilcox writes, &quot;[H]ow many times will we see those in power maintain such a silence while evil proceeds? It is not surprising that [The Gentlemen&#x27;s] attendants wear straitjackets; their garb suggests the insanity of such behavior—the pretense of civilized politeness while killing is accepted is a matter of course.&quot;

=== Fairy tales ===
Two other episodes in the &quot;Buffy&quot; canon are also based on, or have elements of, fairy tales: &quot;Killed by Death&quot;, where only sick children can see a demon who sucks away their lives, and &quot;Gingerbread&quot;, where a demon takes on the forms of Hansel and Gretel to create a moral panic in Sunnydale. &quot;Hush&quot; is often compared to these episodes because they contain similar elements. Whedon intended The Gentlemen to be Brothers Grimm-like monsters, with Giles playing the role of the wise man, Buffy the princess, and Tara the &quot;little girl wandering through the woods&quot;. In this incarnation, however, Buffy is a swashbuckling princess whose scream saves the town. (Joss Whedon reported in the DVD commentary that the actual scream was dubbed from another actor.) Instead of being the damsel in distress she is the hero, breaking through a boarded-up window in the belfry, then grabbing a rope and swinging across the room to kill one of The Gentlemen&#x27;s footmen by smashing her feet into his chest.

In many &quot;Buffy&quot; episodes, understanding why evil has appeared is important in knowing how to fight it, but the reasons for The Gentlemen&#x27;s arrival and their need to take seven human hearts are never made explicit; they are simply there. According to Giles&#x27; overhead transparencies, they can appear in any town. Several &quot;Buffy&quot; scholars assert that a sexual element similar to what is presented in classic fairy tales is evident in &quot;Hush&quot;. Buffy often has prophetic dreams, and it is in a dream that she first sees one of The Gentlemen; she sees a flash of his face just as Riley touches her shoulder. Buffy has only been sexually intimate twice before: with the vampire Angel, whose lovemaking cost him his soul, and with the womanizing Parker Abrams. Riley is notably different from both and Buffy&#x27;s anxiety about becoming intimate with him, according to scholars, either calls The Gentlemen to Sunnydale or is represented by them. The Gentlemen murder by cutting chests open and removing hearts, penetrative acts. In Buffy&#x27;s dream Riley says, &quot;If I kiss you, it&#x27;ll make the sun go down&quot; and when he does so, it instantly becomes night, as if Buffy has crossed over a threshold. Riley&#x27;s kiss creates physical and emotional intimacy, but initiates mental, intuitive knowledge as well: in this episode Buffy learns of Riley&#x27;s secret role as a member of The Initiative. Threshold imagery is again used when Tara and Willow block the door with their combined efforts, shutting The Gentlemen out.

==Reception==
When the episode was originally broadcast in the United States on December 14, 1999, it received a Nielsen rating of 4.1 and a share of 7, meaning that roughly 4.1 percent of all television-equipped households, and 7 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. The episode placed fifth in its timeslot and 93rd among broadcast television for the week of December 13–19, 1999. It was the most watched program on WB that night, and the second most watched program that week, trailing &quot;7th Heaven&quot;.

&quot;Hush&quot; was highly praised when it aired, not only for its riskiness in presenting viewers with extended silence, but for the frightening qualities of The Gentlemen. Robert Bianco from &quot;USA Today&quot; comments, &quot;(i)n a medium in which producers tend to grow bored with their own creations, either trashing them or taking them in increasingly bizarre directions, Whedon continues to find new ways to make his fabulously entertaining series richer and more compelling. With or without words, he&#x27;s a TV treasure.&quot; In the &quot;Racine Journal Times&quot; and &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;, Chuck Barney writes, &quot;I wondered if this enormously entertaining cult favorite would lose some starch once our favorite little slayer moved on to college. But happily, it continues to win us over with the way it deftly bounces between the genres of comedy, horror and romance. The recent silent episode (Hush) was brilliant.&quot; Alan Sepinwall in &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; calls it a &quot;magnificently daring episode&quot;, explaining &quot;(w)hat makes it particularly brave is that, even when &quot;Buffy&quot; has been failing to click dramatically this year, the show has still been able to get by on the witty dialogue, which is all but absent after the first few scenes. Whedon finds ways to get around that, with several cast members—particularly Anthony Head as the scholarly Giles and Alyson Hannigan as nervous witch Willow—proving to be wonderfully expressive silent comedians.&quot;

Likewise, in the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, David Bianculli states that the episode is &quot;a true tour de force, and another inventive triumph for this vastly underrated series&quot; Brian Courtis in Australia&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Age&quot; agrees, and writes that &quot;Hush&quot; is &quot;(c)lever, well-written and brightly directed ... Buffy at its best.&quot; Robert Hanks from &quot;The Independent&quot; in the UK writes that &quot;&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, in most weeks the funniest and cleverest programme on TV, reached new heights&quot; with &quot;Hush&quot;. Noel Murray in &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; calls it an &quot;episode unlike any other, with a lusher score and some of the most genuinely disturbing imagery I&#x27;ve yet seen on &quot;Buffy&quot;.&quot; The episode was included among 13 of the scariest films or television shows by Salon.com, and justified by Stephanie Zacharek, who states it &quot;scans just like one of those listless dreams in which you try to scream, and can&#x27;t. Everybody&#x27;s had &#x27;em—and yet the way the eerie quiet of &#x27;Hush&#x27; sucks you in, you feel as if the experience is privately, and unequivocally, your own.&quot;

&quot;Hush&quot; was the only episode of the entire &quot;Buffy&quot; series to be nominated for an Emmy Award in the Writing in a Drama Series category. It also received a Writers Guild of America Award nomination. Following the series finale in 2003, &quot;Hush&quot; continued to receive praise. Lisa Rosen in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; states that the episode is &quot;one of TV&#x27;s most terrifying hours&quot;. &quot;Smashing Magazine&quot; counted &quot;Hush&quot; as one of the top ten television episodes that inspire creativity. Keith McDuffee of TV Squad named it the best Buffy episode in the series, writing &quot;(i)f someone who had never seen Buffy (blasphemy!) asked me to show them just one episode of the show to get them hooked, this would be it&quot;. TV.com named it as the fourth most frightening episode in television history. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; called it &quot;an intriguing, clever episode with a unique dynamic... It really is a genius installment and one of the finest television episodes ever produced.&quot;

Jarett Wieselman of the &quot;New York Post&quot; listed the scene in which Buffy mimes staking The Gentlemen and its humorous misunderstandings by the other characters among the top five best &quot;Buffy&quot; moments, especially praising Sarah Michelle Gellar&#x27;s (Buffy) comedic acting. Nikki Stafford, author of &quot;Bite Me! The Unofficial Guide to Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; writes &quot;Hush&quot; is &quot;mind-blowing&quot; and &quot;one of the best hours of television ever&quot;. For Buffy studies scholar Roz Kaveney, the primary reason &quot;Hush&quot; was successful was the acting strengths of the central cast. &quot;Hush&quot; is Alyson Hannigan&#x27;s (Willow) favorite episode of the &quot;Buffy&quot; series, and the one Nicholas Brendon (Xander) considers the most frightening. Series writer Jane Espenson stated the episode &quot;redefined what an episode of television could do&quot;.

&quot;Vox&quot;, ranking it at #3 of all 144 episodes on their &quot;Worst to Best&quot; list, wrote in honor of the show&#x27;s 20th anniversary, &quot;It&#x27;s more of a given now that TV shows will eventually break with their own format for the fun of it, but that was far from inevitable when &#x27;Hush&#x27; briefly made Buffy half silent movie, half straight horror... resulting in both frightening and hilarious scenes that have rightfully gone down as some of &quot;Buffy&quot;″s most ingenious moments.&quot;

<text>James and the Giant Peach is a 1996 musical fantasy film directed by Henry Selick, based on the 1961 novel of the same name by Roald Dahl. It was produced by Tim Burton and Denise Di Novi, and starred Paul Terry as James. The film is a combination of live action and stop-motion animation. Joanna Lumley and Miriam Margolyes played James&#x27;s self-absorbed Aunts Spiker and Sponge, respectively (in the live-action segments), with Simon Callow, Richard Dreyfuss, Jane Leeves, Susan Sarandon and David Thewlis, as well as Margolyes, voicing his insect friends in the animation sequences.

Released on April 12, 1996 in the United States, the film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its story and visual aspects. However, the film was a box office failure, grossing $300,000 less than its budget.

==Plot==

In the summer of 1948, English boy James Henry Trotter is a young orphan living with his sadistic and domineering aunts Spiker and Sponge after his parents were &quot;eaten alive&quot; by a rhinoceros.

One day, after rescuing a spider from his hysterical aunts, James obtains magic &quot;crocodile tongues&quot; from a mysterious old man, which have the power to grow anything they come into contact with to colossal size. James, running home, trips and spills the bag onto the ground; the neon, wormlike &quot;tongues&quot; leap away and into the ground underneath an old peach tree, thus growing a massive fruit that Spiker and Sponge exploit as a tourist attraction.

At night, James eats through the peach with one of the crocodile tongues sneaking into a piece and finds inside the pit several human-sized anthropomorphic invertebrates: Mr. Grasshopper, Mr. Centipede, Ms. Spider (the spider he saved prior), Mr. Earthworm, Mrs. Ladybug, and Mrs. Glowworm. As they hear Spiker and Sponge searching for James, Centipede cuts the stem connecting the peach to the tree and the peach rolls away to the Atlantic Ocean.

The invertebrates fly the peach to New York City with a flock of seagulls (each tied with a string to the peach stem), as James has dreamed of visiting the Empire State Building like his parents wanted to. Obstacles include a giant mechanical shark and undead skeletal pirates in the Arctic Ocean.

When the group arrives, they are suddenly attacked by the tempestuous form of the rhinoceros that killed James&#x27; parents. James, though scared, gets everyone to safety and confronts the rhino before it strikes the peach with lightning.

James and the peach fall to the city below, landing on the Empire State Building. James coughs up the crocodile tongue he unknowing ate and emerges from the peach. After he is rescued by the biggest crane in New York, Spiker and Sponge arrive and attempt to claim James and the peach. James tells the crowd of his amazing adventure and exposes his aunts&#x27; abuses. Enraged at James, Spiker and Sponge attempt to attack him with stolen fire axes, but the insects arrive to save him. Ms. Spider subdues the two aunts by wrapping them up in her silk as a beat cop has the crane remove the aunts. James introduces his friends to the crowd of onlookers, and allows the children to eat the peach.

The peach pit is made into a cottage in Central Park, where James lives happily with the bugs. The newspaper articles reveal the bugs&#x27; fame in the city: Mr. Centipede runs for New York mayor and is now James&#x27; father; Miss Spider opens a club and is his mother; Mr. Earthworm becomes a mascot for a skin-care company (and either James&#x27; uncle or cousin); Mrs. Ladybug becomes an obstetrician and James&#x27; aunt; Mr. Grasshopper becomes a concert violinist (and James&#x27; grandfather); and Mrs. Glowworm becomes the light in the torch of the Statue of Liberty (and his grandmother). James celebrates his ninth birthday with his new family and friends.

== Production ==
At Walt Disney Animation Studios in the early 1980s, Joe Ranft tried to convince the staff to produce a film based on Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; (1961), a book that enamored him with its &quot;liberating&quot; material ever since he first read it in third grade. However, Disney refused for reasons of a potentially expensive and difficult animation process and the source material&#x27;s weird subject matter. Ranft also tried to pitch the film to Disney through Pixar although the studio settled on a different pitch instead which became &quot;Toy Story&quot;. Among the animators exposed to the book by Ranft was Henry Selick; while he enjoyed the book and thought about adapting it to screen for several years, he understood the obstacles doing so, such as the source material&#x27;s dreamy nature, episodic structure, and the reputation of other Dahl books being so agitational some parts of the world banned them.

Felicity Dahl, Roald&#x27;s widow and executor of his estate, began offering film rights to the book in the summer in 1992; among those interested included Steven Spielberg and Danny DeVito.

Walt Disney Pictures acquired the film rights to the book from the Dahl estate in 1992. Brian Rosen was hired as producer by Disney for his experience in animated projects like &quot;&quot; (1992) and live-action films such as &quot;Mushrooms&quot; (1995).

Dennis Potter was hired to write a draft. Rosen described it as &quot;slightly black and bizarre&quot;, a tone Disney did not approve of, particularly with the sharks being Nazis. Once Potter died, Karey Kirkpatrick and Bruce Joel Rubin came in to write separate drafts, of which Kirkpatrick&#x27;s was chosen. Unlike the novel, James&#x27;s aunts are not killed by the rolling peach (though his parents&#x27; deaths occur as in the novel) but follow him to New York. The character Silkworm was removed to not overload on the amount of characters to animate; in the book, her purpose was limited to what Miss Spider did in the film, which was to attach the peach to several seagulls during the shark chase.

To write four songs for the movie, Selick approached Elvis Costello, who showed an interest in doing the film. Unfortunately, Disney&#x27;s music division showed no interest in Costello. &quot;Their alarms just went off, and they said, &#x27;No, that&#x27;s too weird&#x27;&quot;, said Selick. Disney suggested Randy Newman as an alternative. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to use Randy&quot;, said Selick, &quot;only because John Lasseter was already using him for &quot;Toy Story&quot;&quot;. Andy Partridge, the lead singer of the rock group XTC, originally wrote four songs for the film, &quot;All I Dream Of Is a Friend&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Us Bug Ya&quot;, &quot;Stinking Rich Song&quot; and &quot;Everything Will Be All Right&quot;, &quot;one of which was very beautiful&quot;, said Selick, but was replaced by Newman due to creative differences between Selick and Disney regarding the choice of soundtrack composer and the fact that Disney wanted to own the copyright to the songs for perpetuity.

Before the start of production, Disney and Selick debated on whether the film should be live-action or stop-motion-animated, the company skeptical of the stop-motion solution. Selick had originally planned James to be a live actor through the entire film, then later considered doing the whole film in stop-motion; but ultimately settled on entirely live-action and entirely stop-motion sequences, to keep lower costs. The film begins with 20 minutes of live-action, but becomes stop-motion animation after James enters the peach, and then live-action again when James arrives in New York City (although the arthropod characters remained in stop-motion). Like &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939), the color palette changes when James enters the Peach to indicate he has entered a magical setting, from greys and greens to vibrant colors.

Filming began on November 15, 1994, with the live-action scenes wrapping on December 27 of that year, and the stop-motion scenes continuing until January 19, 1996.

==Release==
The film was theatrically released on April 12, 1996.

Disney released the film worldwide except for a few countries in Europe including the United Kingdom, where Pathé (the owner of co-producer Allied Filmmakers) handled distribution and sold the rights to independent companies. The only countries where Disney does not have control over the movie are the United Kingdom and Germany, where the film was released by Guild Film Distribution and Tobis Film respectively.

===Box office===
The film opened at the number 2 spot at the box office, missing out on the top spot to &quot;Primal Fear&quot;. The film took in $7,539,098 that weekend, and stayed in the top 10 for the next 5 weeks before dropping to 11th place. The film went on to gross $28,946,127 in the United States and Canada and $37.7 million worldwide, which against a budget of $38 million, made the film commercially a box office bomb.

===Home media===
The film was released on VHS on October 15, 1996. A digitally restored Blu-ray/DVD combo pack was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on August 3, 2010, in the United States.

==Reception==
The film received positive reviews during its initial release.

Though Roald Dahl refused numerous offers to have a film version of &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; produced during his lifetime, his widow, Liccy, approved an offer to produce a live-action version. She thought Roald &quot;would have been delighted with what they did with &quot;James&quot;. It is a wonderful film.&quot;

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of based on reviews from critics, with an average score of . The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;The arresting and dynamic visuals, offbeat details and light-as-air storytelling make &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; solid family entertainment.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, lists the film with a weighted average score of 78 out of 100 based on 36 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A-&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a positive review, praising the animated part, but calling the live-action segments &quot;crude&quot;. Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin called the film &quot;a technological marvel, arch and innovative with a daringly offbeat visual conception&quot; and &quot;a strenuously artful film with a macabre edge.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Music, Original Musical or Comedy Score, by Randy Newman. It won Best Animated Feature Film at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival.

== Potential remake ==
In August 2016, Sam Mendes was revealed to be in negotiations with Disney to direct another live action adaptation of the novel, with Nick Hornby in talks for the script. In May 2017, however, Mendes was no longer attached to the project due to his entering talks with Disney about directing a live-action film adaptation of &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, which he would also drop out on with Robert Zemeckis taking his place.

<text>Studio One is one of Jamaica&#x27;s most renowned record labels and recording studios; it has been described as the Motown of Jamaica. The record label was involved with most of the major music movements in Jamaica during the 1960s and 1970s, including ska, rocksteady, reggae, dub and dancehall.

== History ==
Studio One was founded by Clement &quot;Coxsone&quot; Dodd in 1954, and the first recordings were cut in 1963 on Brentford Road in Kingston. Amongst its earliest records were &quot;Easy Snappin&quot; by Theophilus Beckford, backed by Clue J &amp; His Blues Blasters, and &quot;This Man is Back&quot; by trombonist Don Drummond. Dodd had previously issued music on a series of other labels, including World Disc, and had run Sir Coxsone the Downbeat, one of the largest and most reputable sound systems in the Kingston ghettos.

In the early 1960s, the house band providing backing for the vocalists were the Skatalites (1964–65), whose members (including Roland Alphonso, Don Drummond, Tommy McCook, Jackie Mittoo, Lester Sterling and Lloyd Brevett) were recruited from the Kingston jazz scene by Dodd. The Skatalites split up in 1965 after Drummond was jailed for murder, and Dodd formed new house band the Soul Brothers (1965–66), later named the Soul Vendors (1967) and Sound Dimension (1967-). From 1965 to 1968 they played 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., 5 days a week, 12 rhythms a day (about 60 rhythms a week) with Jackie Mittoo as music director, Brian Atkinson (1965–1968) on bass, Hux Brown on guitar, Harry Haughton (guitar), Joe Isaacs on drums (1966–1968), Denzel Laing on percussion, and on horns (some initially and some throughout): Roland Alphonso, Dennis &#x27;Ska&#x27; Campbell, Bobby Ellis, Lester Sterling, among others on horns during the era of Rock Steady. Headley Bennett, Ernest Ranglin, Vin Gordon and Leroy Sibbles were included among a fluid line-up, to record tracks directed by Jackie Mittoo at Studio One from 1966-1968.

During the night hours at Studio One from 1965-1968, singers like Bob Marley, Burning Spear, The Heptones, The Ethiopians, Ken Boothe, Rita Marley, Marcia Griffiths, Judy Mowatt, Alton Ellis, Delroy Wilson, Bunny Wailer and Johnny Nash, among others, would put on headphones to sing lyrics to original tracks recorded by the Soul Brothers earlier each day. These seminal recordings included &quot;Real Rock&quot; (by Sound Dimension), &quot;Heavy Rock&quot;, &quot;Jamaica Underground&quot;, &quot;Wakie Wakie&quot;, &quot;Lemon Tree&quot;, &quot;Hot Shot&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Still In Love With You&quot;, &quot;Dancing Mood&quot;, and &quot;Creation Rebel&quot;.

Jackie Mittoo, Joe Isaacs, and Brian Atkinson left Studio One in 1968 and moved to Canada. The Soul Brothers (a.k.a. Sound Dimension) formed the basis of reggae music in the late 1960s, being versioned and re-versioned time after time over decades by musicians like Shaggy, Sean Paul, Snoop Lion, The Clash, String Cheese Incident, UB40, Sublime, and countless other Billboard originals and remakes trying to emulate their original Rock Steady sound at Coxsone&#x27;s Studio One.

The studio was closed when Dodd relocated to New York City in the mid-1980s; he continued to run the label from his new base.

== Studio One artists ==
Studio One has recorded and released music by (and had a large hand in shaping the careers of) artists including:

Noted rival Prince Buster began his career working for Dodd&#x27;s sound system. In addition, record producer Harry J recorded many of his best-known releases at Studio One.

<doc id="745107" wikidata="Q1292438" url="?curid=745107" title="Edward H. Levi">
<text>Edward Hirsch Levi (June 26, 1911 – March 7, 2000) was an American legal scholar and academic. He served as dean of the University of Chicago Law School from 1950 to 1962, president of the University of Chicago from 1968 to 1975, and then as United States Attorney General from 1975 to 1977 under President Gerald Ford. Levi is regularly cited as the &quot;model of a modern attorney general&quot;, the &quot;greatest lawyer of his time&quot;, and is credited with restoring order after Watergate. He is considered, along with Yale&#x27;s Whitney Griswold, the greatest of postwar American university presidents.

A native of Chicago, Levi graduated from the University of Chicago and Yale University. He served as a special assistant to the U.S. Attorney General during World War II before returning to the University of Chicago Law School, where he was later named dean. After leaving government service in the Ford administration, Levi returned to teaching in Chicago.

==Early life and education==
Levi was born in Chicago, the son of Elsa B. ( Hirsch) and Gerson B. Levi, a rabbi from Scotland. His maternal grandfather was Reform rabbi Emil Gustav Hirsch, son of the German philosopher and rabbi Samuel Hirsch. He received his A.B. Phi Beta Kappa from the undergraduate college of the University of Chicago in 1932, and later his J.D. at the University of Chicago Law School in 1935. The following year he was named an assistant professor of law at the Law School and was admitted to the Illinois bar. He earned a J.S.D. from Yale Law School, where he was also a Sterling Fellow in 1938.

==Education and political career==
During World War II he served as a special assistant to the Attorney General of the United States. In 1945, he returned to the University of Chicago Law School and was named dean of the law school in 1950. In 1950, he also worked as chief counsel for the Subcommittee on Monopoly Power of the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary. He resigned as law school dean and became provost of the university in 1962. That same year, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

He was a member of the &quot;White House Central Group on Domestic Affairs&quot; in 1964, the &quot;White House Task Force on Education&quot; from 1966 to 1967 and the &quot;President&#x27;s Task Force on Priorities in Higher Education&quot; from 1969 to 1970.

He became the University of Chicago&#x27;s president in 1968, serving until 1975, when President Gerald R. Ford appointed him 71st Attorney General of the United States. Levi was the first Jewish Attorney General of the United States. During his presidency of the University of Chicago he refused to call the Chicago City Police to evict students occupying the university administrative building.

During his term as Attorney General, he issued a set of guidelines (in 1976) to limit the activities of the FBI. These guidelines required the FBI to show evidence of a crime before using secret police techniques like wiretaps or entering someone&#x27;s home without warning. These guidelines were replaced by new ones issued in 1983 by Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Attorney General, William French Smith. He urged President Ford to appoint Robert Bork, who was his former student and Solicitor General, or fellow Chicagoan John Paul Stevens to the United States Supreme Court, and Ford followed his advice. Levi later testified in support of Bork at his confirmation hearing. Serving under him, in various high staff positions, were such people as Rudolph Giuliani, Robert Bork, Antonin Scalia, Rex E. Lee, and Arthur Raymond Randolph.

Levi filed a lawsuit preventing the formation of the Westheimer Independent School District, a proposed school district in Texas that was to break away from the Houston Independent School District, on the grounds of the U.S. Voting Rights Act as his last official action before leaving his post as Attorney General.

==Later career==
After his term as Attorney General, he returned to teaching at the University of Chicago&#x27;s Law School and College. He was a visiting professor at Stanford University Law School from 1977 to 1978. He was the author of &quot;An Introduction to Legal Reasoning&quot;, which was first published in 1949 and his speeches were collected in &quot;Point of View: Talks on Education&quot;. He was also a trustee of the University of Chicago and the MacArthur Foundation, and was a chairman and a member of the Council on Legal Education for Professional Responsibility. He was a member of the American Philosophical Society.

==Personal life==
Levi married Kate Sulzberger (formerly Hecht) in 1946. They had three sons, John Gerson, David Frank, and Michael Edward: John is a prominent attorney in Sidley Austin&#x27;s Chicago office and served as chair of the board of directors of the Legal Services Corporation; David is a former U.S. Attorney and federal judge in the Eastern District of California and 14th dean of Duke Law School; Michael is a scientist in both particle physics and cosmology at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 

Levi died from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in Chicago on March 7, 2000, aged 88.

== Legacy ==
=== Edward H. Levi Award ===
In 2005, the Justice Department commemorated the 30th anniversary of his appointment as Attorney General with a ceremony and creation of the Edward H. Levi Award for Outstanding Professionalism and Exemplary Integrity.

The Award was established to pay tribute to the memory and achievements of Mr. Levi, whose career as an attorney, law professor and dean, and public servant exemplified these qualities in the best traditions of the Department. Friends and former colleagues, including former Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld; U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justices John Paul Stevens and Antonin Scalia; former Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach; and former U.S. Court of Appeals Judge and Solicitor General Robert H. Bork, gathered to honor Mr. Levi.

===Levi Hall===
The University of Chicago&#x27;s primary administration building, holding the offices of the President and Provost, was renamed the Edward H. Levi Hall in 2013. A portrait of Levi hangs in the lobby of the building.

<text>The Sayyid dynasty was the fourth dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate, with four rulers ruling from 1414 to 1451 for 37 years. The first ruler of the dynasty, Khizr Khan, who was the Timurid vassal of Multan, conquered Delhi in 1414, while the rulers proclaimed themselves the Sultans of the Delhi Sultanate under Mubarak Shah, which succeeded the Tughlaq dynasty and ruled the Sultanate until they were displaced by the Lodi dynasty in 1451.

==Origins==
A contemporary writer Yahya Sirhindi mentions in his &quot;Tarikh-i-Mubarak Shahi&quot; that Khizr Khan was a descendant of Muhammad. Members of the dynasty derived their title, Sayyid, or the descendants of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, based on the claim that they belonged to his lineage through his daughter Fatima. However, Yahya Sirhindi based his conclusions on unsubstantial evidence, the first being a casual recognition by the famous saint Sayyid Jalaluddin Bukhari of Uch Sharif of his Sayyid heritage in the household of his adoptive grandfather Malik Mardan Daulat who is also referred to as Malik Mardan Bhatti by Yahya, and the second being the Sultan&#x27;s noble character which distinguished him as possessing the moral qualities of Muhammad&#x27;s descendant. 

Abraham Eraly is of the opinion that Khizr Khan&#x27;s ancestors were likely descendants of an Arab family who had long ago settled in the region of Multan during the early Tughluq period, but he doubts his Sayyid lineage. A.L. Srivastava shares a similar viewpoint. According to Richard M. Eaton and oriental scholar Simon Digby, Khizr Khan was a Punjabi chieftain belonging to the Khokhar clan, who was sent to Timur as an ambassador and negotiator from the most adjacent area, the Punjab, ultimately becoming the power holder in Delhi, thanks to the contacts he had acquired.

==History==

Khizr Khan was originally a noble in the Delhi Sultanate during the Tughlaq Dynasty and was the governor of Multan under Sultan Firuz Shah. He was expelled from the city by the Muin tribes under Sarang Khan who occupied Multan in 1395, an Indian Muslim and the brother of Mallu Iqbal Khan, who was the de-facto ruler of Delhi. Sarang Khan was aided by the servants of Malik Mardan Bhatti, a former governor of Multan and the grandfather of Khizr Khan by adoption. 

Following Timur&#x27;s 1398 Sack of Delhi, he appointed Khizr Khan as deputy of Multan (Punjab). He held Lahore, Dipalpur, Multan and Upper Sindh. Collecting his forces in Multan, Khizr Khan defeated and killed Mallu Iqbal Khan in Delhi in 1405. He then captured Delhi on 28 May 1414 thereby establishing the Sayyid dynasty. Khizr Khan did not take up the title of Sultan, but continued the fiction of his allegiance to Timur as &quot;Rayat-i-Ala&quot; (vassal) of the Timurids - initially that of Timur, and later his son Shah Rukh. After the accession of Khizr Khan, the Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Sindh were reunited under the Delhi Sultanate, where he spent his time subduing rebellions. 

Khizr Khan was succeeded by his son Sayyid Mubarak Shah after his death on 20 May 1421. Mubarak Shah referred to himself as &quot;Muizz-ud-Din Mubarak Shah&quot; on his coins, removing the Timurid name with the name of the Caliph, and declared himself a Shah. A detailed account of his reign is available in the &quot;Tarikh-i-Mubarak Shahi&quot; written by Yahya-bin-Ahmad Sirhindi. After the death of Mubarak Shah, his nephew, Muhammad Shah ascended the throne and styled himself as Sultan Muhammad Shah. Just before his death, he called his son Sayyid Ala-ud-Din Shah from Badaun, and nominated him as successor.

The last ruler of the Sayyids, Ala-ud-Din, voluntarily abdicated the throne of the Delhi Sultanate in favour of Bahlul Khan Lodi on 19 April 1451, and left for Badaun, where he died in 1478.

==Kings==
===Khizr Khan===

Khizr Khan was the governor of Multan under Firuz Shah Tughlaq. When Timur invaded India, Khizr Khan, a Sayyid from Multan joined him. Timur appointed him the governor of Multan and Lahore. He then conquered the city of Delhi and started the rule of the Sayyids in 1414. He was ruling in the name of Timur. He could not assume an independent position in all respects. As a mark of recognition of the suzerainty of the Timurids, the name of the Timurid ruler (Shah Rukh) was recited in the khutba but as an interesting innovation, the name of Khizr Khan was also attached to it. But strangely enough, the name of the Timurid ruler was not inscribed on the coins and the name of the old Tughlaq sultan continued on the currency. No coins are known in the name of Khizr Khan.

===Mubarak Shah===

Mubarak Shah was the son of Khizr Khan, who ascended the throne in the year 1421. Mubarak Shah discontinued his father&#x27;s nominal allegiance to Timur. He freely used the royal title of Shah along with his own name, and professed allegiance to the Khalifah alone. He was the ablest ruler of the Sayyid dynasty. He defeated the advancing Hoshang Shah Ghori, the ruler of the Malwa Sultanate and forced him to pay heavy tribute early in his reign. Mubarak Shah also put down the rebellion of Jasrath Khokhar and failed to fend off several invasions by the Timurids in Kabul.and He Became a Vassal of Shah Rukh

===Muhammad Shah===

Muhammad Shah was a nephew of Mubarak Shah. He ruled from 1434 to 1443. Muhammad Shah acceded to the throne with the help of Sarwar ul Mulk. After that Shah wanted to free himself from the domination of Sarwar ul Mulk with the help of his faithful vizier Kamal ul Mulk. His reign was marked by many rebellions and conspiracies, and he died in the year 1445. Multan became independent under the Langahs during his rule.

===Alam Shah===
The last ruler of the Sayyid dynasty, Alauddin Alam Shah was defeated by Bahlol Lodi, who started the Lodi dynasty.

<doc id="745119" wikidata="Q1846951" url="?curid=745119" title="United States congressional delegations from Texas">
<text>A long history exists of various individuals serving in the congressional delegations from the State of Texas to the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate, with all of this occurring after Texas as a territory was annexed as a State in December 1865.

Texas has a total of 38 seats as of 2024. The current dean of the Texas delegation is Representative Lloyd Doggett (TX-37) of the Democratic Party. He has served in the House since 1995 and is 78 years old.

Republicans have complete control of the congressional redistricting process in Texas, as any new maps are drawn and passed by the Republican-held state legislature and signed into law by the Republican governor. This has resulted in Texas’ maps being a partisan gerrymander, with few competitive districts.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

<text>Amelia Marshall (born April 2, 1958) is an American actress. She is best known for playing the roles of Gilly Grant Speakes on the CBS soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot; (1989 to 1996), Belinda Keefer on the ABC soap opera &quot;All My Children,&quot; (1996 to 1999), and Liz Sanbourne on the NBC soap opera &quot;Passions&quot; (2001 to 2007).

== Early life ==
Marshall was born in Albany, Georgia and lived in Atlanta, Georgia and Amityville, New York before her family settled in Houston, Texas. Her mother was a math teacher and her father was an executive for a large insurance company. She has an older sister and a younger brother. She was named after her great aunt.

A friend talked Marshall into trying out for the vocal department at the Kinder High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Houston. Even though she had little training, she auditioned at age thirteen by singing &quot;Ave Maria.&quot; She was accepted and decided to take Survey of Dance as an elective. She studied with the Houston Ballet and was a member of the Houston Jazz Ballet Company. She enrolled at The University of Texas at Austin, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration. Marshall was a cheerleader in college. After graduation, she worked as a telephone repair supervisor for Southwestern Bell for two years. She learned how to repair telephones and climb telephone poles.

==Career==
While working for Southwestern Bell, Marshall danced with a regional company at night. She auditioned for a professional theater company in Fort Worth and won a role. For the next seven years, she made a living in theater. Her early credits include roles on Broadway in &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; (1983), &quot;Harrigan &#x27;n Hart&quot; (1985), and &quot;Big Deal&quot; (1986).

Marshall appeared as a dancer in &quot;Robert Klein on Broadway&quot;, a 1986 special. She performed at the Kennedy Center in Duke Ellington&#x27;s &quot;Queenie Pie,&quot; and at the Houston Grand Opera in Scott Joplin&#x27;s &quot;Treemonisha&quot;. She also performed in national tours of &quot;Cats&quot; and &quot;West Side Story&quot;.

Marshall played Miranda on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in 1984. The role was supposed to be long term, but the show experienced backstage turnover when Paul Rauch was hired as executive producer. Marshall was written out after two weeks.

She was cast as Gillian &quot;Gilly&quot; Grant Speakes on the CBS soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot; in 1989. Marshall worked as a day player on the show for more than a year before she was put on contract. She was the second African American actor to receive a contract role on &quot;Guiding Light&quot; (her co-star, Vince Williams, was the first). Marshall was dismissed from the series, last airing in July 1996. She said she was let go because of changes in the show&#x27;s writing staff and a lack of interest in writing for Gilly.

She was cast on &quot;All My Children&quot; as Belinda Keefer in September 1996, replacing Kim Hawthorne. She was released from the show in July 1999. Fans were outraged by her dismissal.

In 1997, she starred Off-Broadway, playing Diane Gardner in &quot;Minor Demons&quot; at the Century Center for the Performing Arts.

On September 27, 2001, Marshall made her first appearance on &quot;Passions&quot; in the role of the villainess Liz Sanbourne, sister of Dr. Eve Russell. Marshall was on contract for four and a half years, until she was dismissed from the soap in July 2007 as a result of budget cuts.

In 2001 and 2002, she appeared in the films &quot;Stuart Little 2&quot; and &quot;According to Spencer&quot;. On television, she guest-starred on &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; and &quot;The District&quot;.

== Personal life ==
She married Daryl Waters on November 28, 1992, at St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel on the campus of Columbia University. They dated for five years prior to getting married. They divorced in 1995.

Marshall married Kent Schaffer in 1997 and they divorced in 2001. They have a son, who was born in January 1998.

<text>Washington &amp; Jefferson College (W&amp;J College or W&amp;J) is a private liberal arts college in Washington, Pennsylvania, United States. The college traces its origin to three Presbyterian missionaries in the 1780s: John McMillan, Thaddeus Dod, and Joseph Smith. Early schools grew into two competing academies, with Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, and Washington College in Washington. The two colleges merged in 1865 to form Washington &amp; Jefferson College. The campus has more than 40 buildings, with the oldest dating to 1793. The college has a strong history of competing literary societies, dating back before the union of Jefferson and Washington Colleges. The athletic program competes in NCAA Division III. Nearly all students live on campus and roughly one-third are members of fraternities or sororities.

==History==
===Early history and the academies===

Washington &amp; Jefferson College traces its origin to three log cabin colleges established by three frontier clergymen in the 1780s: John McMillan, Thaddeus Dod, and Joseph Smith. The three men, all graduates from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), came to present-day Washington County to found churches and spread Presbyterianism to what was then the American frontier beyond the Appalachian Mountains. John McMillan, the most prominent of the three founders because of his strong personality and longevity, came to the area in 1775 and built his log cabin college in 1780 near his church in Chartiers. Thaddeus Dod, known as a keen scholar, built his log cabin college in Lower Ten Mile in 1781. Joseph Smith taught classical studies in his college, called &quot;The Study,&quot; at Buffalo.

Washington Academy was chartered by the Pennsylvania General Assembly on September 24, 1787. The first members of the board of trustees included Reverends Dod and Smith. After a difficult search for a headmaster, in which the trustees consulted Benjamin Franklin, the trustees unanimously selected Thaddeus Dod, considered to be the best scholar in western Pennsylvania. Amid financial difficulties and unrest from the Whiskey Rebellion, the academy held no classes from 1791 to 1796. In 1792, the academy secured four lots at Wheeling and Lincoln street from William Hoge and began construction on the stone Academy Building. During the Whiskey Rebellion, portions of David Bradford&#x27;s militia camped on a hillside that would later become home to the unified Washington &amp; Jefferson College.

In October 1792, after a year&#x27;s delay from its official incorporation resulting from &quot;trouble with Indians,&quot; McMillan was chosen as the headmaster and Canonsburg was chosen as the location for the &quot;Canonsburg Academy.&quot; At a subsequent unknown date, McMillan transferred his students from the log cabin to Canonsburg Academy. Canonsburg Academy was chartered by the General Assembly on March 11, 1794, thus placing it firmly ahead of its sister school, Washington Academy, which was without a faculty, students, or facilities. On January 15, 1802, with McMillan as president of the board, the General Assembly finally granted a charter for &quot;a college at Canonsburgh.&quot;

===Jefferson College and Washington College===

In 1802, Canonsburg Academy was reconstituted as Jefferson College, with John McMillan serving as the first President of the board of trustees. In 1806, Matthew Brown petitioned the Pennsylvania General Assembly to grant Washington Academy a charter, allowing it to be re-christened as Washington College. At various times over the next 60 years, the various parties within the two colleges pursued unification with each other, but the question of where the unified college would be located thwarted those efforts. In 1817, a disagreement over a perceived agreement for unification erupted into &quot;The College War&quot; and threatened the existence of both colleges. In the ensuing years, both colleges began to undertake risky financial moves, especially over-selling scholarships. Thanks to the leadership of Matthew Brown, Jefferson College was in a stronger position to weather the financial storm for a longer period. Desperate for funds, Washington College accepted an offer from the Synod of Wheeling to take control of the college, a move that was supposed to stabilize the finances for a period of time. However, Washington College then undertook another series of risky financial moves that crippled its finances.

===Unification of the colleges===

Following the Civil War, both colleges were short on students and on funds, causing them to join as Washington &amp; Jefferson College in 1865. The charter provided for the college to operate at both Canonsburg and Washington, a position that caused significant difficulty for the administration trying to rescue the college amid ill feelings over the unification. Jonathan Edwards, a pastor from Baltimore who had been president of Hanover College, was elected the first president of the unified Washington &amp; Jefferson College on April 4, 1866. Edwards immediately encountered significant challenges, including the difficulties of administering a college across two campuses, as well as old prejudices and hard feelings among those still loyal to either Jefferson College or Washington College. Edwards resigned in 1869, as the two-campus arrangement was declared a failure and all operations were consolidated in Washington. Before the merger could be completed, Canonsburg residents and Jefferson College partisans filed a lawsuit, known as the &quot;Pennsylvania College Cases&quot;, sought to overturn the consolidation plan. Leadership of the college during this time fell to Samuel J. Wilson, a local pastor, and James I. Brownson, who had earlier been interim president of Washington College. By 1871, the United States Supreme Court upheld the consolidation, allowing the newly configured college to proceed.

===History since unification===

George P. Hays, who had assumed the presidency amid the court battle and the unification controversy, led the newly unified college until 1881. His successor, James D. Moffat, led the college through a period of growth where the college constructed the Old Gym, Hays Hall, Thompson Memorial Library, and Thistle Physics Building, as well as purchasing the land known as the &quot;old fair ground,&quot; now used for Cameron Stadium. Towards the end of his term, Moffat personally paid for the 1912 renovations of McMillan Hall. In 1914, Frederick W. Hinitt was elected president. His tenure was dominated by the United States&#x27; entry into World War I, with an enrollment drop of 50%.

William E. Slemmons, a college trustee and adjunct professor, succeeded Hinitt and served as interim president from May 1918 to June 1919. After the war ended in 1919, Samuel Charles Black took over and helped to stabilize the enrollment. While on a honeymoon tour of national parks, Black became ill and died. His successor, Simon Strousse Baker, was well liked by the college&#x27;s trustees and by &quot;many a townsman&quot;, but the student body felt that Baker was &quot;autocratic&quot; and held an &quot;unfriendly attitude toward the student body as individuals.&quot; Baker defended himself, saying that the perceived ill-will towards students was unintentional and a misunderstanding. Nonetheless, the student body held a strike and general walkout in 1931, prompting Baker to resign.

Baker&#x27;s successor, Ralph Cooper Hutchison, was much more popular with the student body. In an effort to strengthen the college&#x27;s science department, Hutchison extended and expanded the southern portion of the campus, adding the Lazear Chemistry Hall and purchasing McIlvane Hall. When World War II broke out, the campus was opened to the Army Administration School, where hundreds of soldiers received their &quot;training in classifications.&quot; Hutchison resigned in 1945 to take the presidency of his alma mater, Lafayette College. James Herbert Case, Jr., who was president from 1946 to 1950, constructed several new dormitories to handle the influx of veterans under the G.I. Bill. In 1950, Boyd Crumrine Patterson assumed the presidency and oversaw curriculum revisions and the construction of a number of buildings, including the Henry Memorial Center, 10 Greek housing units in the center of campus, the U. Grant Miller Library, the Student Center, the Commons, and two new dormitories. His fundraising abilities grew the college&#x27;s endowment expanded from $2.3 million to nearly $11 million. Patterson retired in 1970, the same year that the trustees authorized the admission of women as undergraduate students. Howard J. Burnett took office as president that year and hired the college&#x27;s first female faculty members and the first female dean. The college also adopted a new academic calendar to include intersession and expanded its academic programs to include the Entrepreneurial Studies Program, the Freshman Forum, and several cooperative international education programs. Student enrollment grew from 830 in 1970 to 1,100 in 1998. Burnett retired as president in 1998.

Under Burnett&#x27;s successor, Brian C. Mitchell, who served as president from 1998 to 2004, the college experienced a growth in construction and an effort to improve relations with the neighboring communities. In 2004, Tori Haring-Smith became the first woman to serve as president of Washington &amp; Jefferson, undertaking an effort to improve the science curriculum and to construct the Swanson Science Center. After 13 years of service, Haring-Smith retired from her position on June 30, 2017. John C. Knapp was named Haring-Smith&#x27;s successor on April 21, 2017, and became the college&#x27;s 13th president on August 1, 2017. On February 27, 2024, the college announced the selection of Elizabeth MacLeod Walls as the 14th president. MacLeod Walls and began her tenure on June 30, 2024.

==Campus==
The campus of Washington &amp; Jefferson College is located in the city of Washington and the East Washington Borough, small-town communities about south of Pittsburgh. The campus is home to more than 40 academic, administrative, recreational, and residential buildings. The northern edge of campus is bound by East Walnut Street, the western edge by South College Street, the southern edge by East Maiden Street, and the eastern edge by South Wade. Portions of the campus extend into the East Washington Historic District. Four historic gates mark four traditional entrances to campus at East Maiden Street, Wheeling Street, South College Street, and Beau Street. In 1947, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission installed a historical marker noting the historic importance of the college.

The oldest surviving building is McMillan Hall, which dates to 1793 and is the oldest college building west of the Allegheny Mountains. The main academic building is Old Main, which is topped with two prominent towers. The Old Gym houses a modern exercise facility. McIlvaine Hall, which was originally home to a female seminary, was demolished in 2008 and replaced by the Swanson Science Center. Davis Memorial Hall was once a dormitory and private house. The Lazear Chemistry Hall, and the Dieter-Porter Life Sciences Building all cater to the scientific curriculum. The Burnett Center and its sister building, the Technology Center, were built in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The first dormitory on campus was Hays Hall. Wade House, Carriage House, and Whitworth House are Victorian homes housing older students. The recently constructed Chestnut Street Housing complex provides housing for the college&#x27;s Greek organizations. The Presidents&#x27; Row is a cluster of ten buildings in the center of campus, several of which are dedicated to theme housing. Two sister dormitories, New Residence Hall and Bica-Ross Hall, feature suite-style living arrangements. Mellon Hall houses female freshman, and Upperclass Hall houses male freshmen. Other dormitories include Alexander Hall, Cooper Hall (formerly Beau Hall), Marshall Hall, Penn House, and the currently unused North Hall. The college administration utilizes several buildings, including the Admissions House, the Alumni House, and the President&#x27;s House, which are all modified Victorian homes. The Clark Family Library, formerly known as the U. Grant Miller Library, is the modern library; its predecessor, Thompson Hall, is now used for administrative purposes. The Hub, The Commons, and the Rossin Campus Center provide recreational and dining facilities for students. The athletic and intramural teams utilize Cameron Stadium for football and track. The Henry Memorial Center is used for basketball, wrestling, swimming, and volleyball. Other athletic facilities include Brooks Park, Ross Memorial Park and Alexandre Stadium, and the Janet L. Swanson Tennis Courts.

==Academics==

As a liberal arts college, Washington &amp; Jefferson College focuses exclusively on undergraduate education. It is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. The college&#x27;s teaching environment reflects the liberal arts tradition of small group instruction by maintaining an average class size of 17 and a student/faculty ratio of 12:1. 85% of faculty have terminal degrees and no classes are taught by teaching assistants. The college has a strong science program, with 35% of students majoring in one of the scientific departments. Within those areas, all 32 professors hold terminal degrees. The most frequent class size is between 10 and 19 students.

The college has a focus on preparing students for graduate school and professional programs. Across all disciplines, 85% to 90% of students who apply to such programs receive offers of admission. Among students who apply to medical school or related health graduate programs, 90% of students gain admission. Approximately 11% of all current W&amp;J alumni are physicians and engineers, making the college third in the nation per capita for producing doctors and scientific researchers. Among students who apply to law school, approximately 90% of students gain admission.

The college recently added The English Language Institute which is a pre-academic program designed to equip multi-lingual learners with the English and academic skills to be prepared for undergraduate study.

===Admission and rankings===

Admission to Washington &amp; Jefferson College is classified as &quot;inclusive&quot; by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. The Princeton Review gave Washington &amp; Jefferson an &quot;Admissions Selectivity Rating&quot; of 85 out of 99.

In 2023, the college received 3,218 applications. It extended offers of admission to 2,624 applicants, or 82%. 314 accepted students chose to enroll, a yield rate of 12%. Of the 40% of incoming students in 2023 who submitted SAT scores, the interquartile range was 1030–1250; of the 10% of incoming students in 2023 who submitted ACT scores, the average composite score was 26. Of all matriculating students, the average high school GPA was 3.5. In 2009, the college developed an SAT-optional admissions program.
In the 2025 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; college rankings, Washington &amp; Jefferson is ranked 90th (tied) of 211 liberal arts colleges nationwide. In Forbes&#x27; &quot;List of America&#x27;s Best Colleges&quot; for 2010, the college was ranked #100 out of the nation&#x27;s institutions of higher education. &quot;The Washington Monthly&quot; ranked the college #132 among all American liberal arts colleges in terms of social mobility, research, and community service. The rankings listed the college as #30 in the nation in terms of Federal Work-Study Program money spent of community service.

As president of the college, Tori Haring-Smith has specifically criticized the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings system, noting that the &quot;financial resources&quot; portion of the rankings formula favors colleges that have higher tuition, even without providing any educational benefits, saying that this has harmed the college&#x27;s ranking because it charged $5,000 to $7,000 less in tuition that its peer institutions. She also questioned the &quot;peer assessment&quot; portion of the rankings and suggested that college presidents are rarely aware of educational improvements in their peer institutions; she noted that Washington &amp; Jefferson College&#x27;s ranking has remained the same for a number of years, even while the college made significant improvements in terms of its acceptance rates and overall selectivity, the addition of academic programs, and the construction of additional buildings. Haring-Smith&#x27;s criticism of the rankings spurred Bob Morse, the founder of the U.S. College Rankings system to respond to the criticisms directly in an article. She has signed the &quot;Presidents Letter,&quot; a nationwide movement asking fellow college presidents to decline participation in the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; reputation survey, a subjective evaluation where college administrators score their competition.

===Curriculum===
The curriculum is centered on the traditional liberal arts education and pre-professional classes. All first-semester freshmen must complete the &quot;First Year Seminar&quot; class, which introduces new students to a variety of lectures, concerts, plays, and trips to museums or galleries based on a different course theme selected each year. In addition to completing an academic major, students must satisfy the college-wide general education requirements, which include classes in the arts, humanities, natural sciences and mathematics, foreign languages, cultural diversity, and academic skills classes including writing, oral communication, quantitative reasoning. Students may choose to complete an academic minor, participate in interdepartmental concentrations, or to focus on an intra-departmental emphasis. Additionally, all students must complete a physical education requirement, amounting to one full semester class, making W&amp;J one of the few liberal arts colleges without a physical education major to have such a requirement. The college maintains a number of combined degree programs, allowing students to attend graduate or professional school in lieu of senior year.

The college follows the 4–1–4 academic calendar, which includes a four-month fall term, a three-week Intersession term in January, followed by a four-month spring term. During the Intersession term, students have the choice of studying abroad, completing an external internship, or taking a specially-designed Intersession course. These Intersession courses are more focused than regular courses and provide professors with an opportunity to teach non-traditional subjects. Past Intersession courses have included &quot;Emerging Diseases: Global and Local&quot; in the biology department, &quot;Corporate Failures, Frauds, and Scandals&quot; in the business department, and &quot;Vampires and Other Bloodsuckers&quot; in the English department, &quot;Holocaust Survivor Narratives&quot; in the German department, and &quot;Alternative Radio&quot; in the communications department. At various times, the faculty organizes an &quot;Integrated Semester,&quot; where professors organize regular departmental courses, specialized projects, and public events dealing with a common interdisciplinary theme. While W&amp;J has not had a Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) program since 1991, the college has a relationship with the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Army and Air Force ROTC programs, allowing W&amp;J students to prepare for an active or reserve commission following graduation. In the 2010–2011 school year, 58% of W&amp;J students studied abroad.

==Student body==

As of fall 2021, the student body totaled 1,156 undergraduate students. The student body is highly residential, with 98% of students residing in campus housing. The number of transfer students joining the student body each year is relatively low, compared to other institutions. Approximately 18% of the student body receives federal Pell Grants. Prior to entering college, 82% of the student body attended public high schools. Roughly 86% of the each freshman class returns to the college for their sophomore year. The overall graduation rate is 70% About 25 to 30% of each incoming class is the first in their family to attend college.

The male to female ratio is 54% to 46%. Like the population of Pennsylvania and the United States as a whole, the largest ethnic group at the college is White American, making up about 82% of the student population. Roughly 10% of the student population does not specify their ethnicity. Other ethnicities, including African American, Asian American, Native American, and Hispanic Americans collectively comprise about 6% of the student body. International students make up 2.05% of the student body.

In 2006, &quot;Men&#x27;s Fitness&quot; named W&amp;J the &quot;14th Fittest College in America,&quot; a ranking that weighed the college&#x27;s fitness offerings and the student body&#x27;s culture of fitness and behavior. In 2009, the college was named to the President&#x27;s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll, in recognition of the student body&#x27;s commitment to community service. The college&#x27;s spends 22% of its Federal Work-Study Program funds on community service projects.

The college has joined the YES Prep School IMPACT Partnership Program to provide support to low-income students from the YES Prep Public Schools.

==Student life==

===Student housing===
The college offers &quot;Theme Community Living,&quot; where students with common interests live in a single living unit. Past themes have included the &quot;Intensive Study,&quot; the &quot;Service Leadership Community,&quot; the &quot;International House,&quot; &quot;Music House,&quot; the &quot;WashPA Radio Theme Community&quot; for students who participate in the WNJR college radio station, and the &quot;Pet House&quot;. Students proposing a theme community must develop an educational plan centered on the theme. The college does not typically allow students to live in off-campus housing.

===Clubs===

Students may organize new clubs by presenting a constitution and a list of members to the college administration and the student government for approval. This approval process does not authorize any club to act on behalf of the college, nor does approval indicate any the college&#x27;s agreement with the club&#x27;s purpose.

The college recognizes over 70 student clubs on campus. A number of student clubs are dedicated to encouraging interest in a specific academic discipline, including the &quot;W&amp;J Denominators&quot; mathematics club, the Society of Physics Students, and the Pre-Health Professions Society. Others are organized along ethnic and cultural lines, including the Black Student Union and the Asian Culture Association. Both major American political parties have chapters at the college, in the form of the &quot;W&amp;J College Democrats&quot; and the Young Republicans. Some clubs take the form of non-varsity athletic teams, including the Men&#x27;s Rugby Club, the Women&#x27;s Rugby Club, the Equestrian Club, Men&#x27;s Volleyball Club and the Ultimate Frisbee Club. Several clubs create volunteer opportunities though Big Brothers/Big Sisters and the United Way. Many religious faiths are represented, including the , Newman Club, and the Student Christian Association, as well as an Interfaith Leadership Club which organizes interfaith events. Many other clubs encourage interests in various academic and non-academic activities, including the Green Club (the college&#x27;s environmental club), the Outdoors Club, and others which are mainly inactive like the Bottega Art Club, the Franklin Literary Society, and the Chess Club.

===Student media===
Student media offerings at Washington &amp; Jefferson College include a college newspaper, a college radio station, a yearbook, and a student-edited literary journal. All students, regardless of academic major, are eligible to contribute to these media organizations.

Founded in 1909, the &quot;Red &amp; Black&quot; student newspaper has a weekly circulation of 1,250 copies. The student staff handles all aspects of the production, including writing, editing, graphic design, layout, and advertising sales. The &quot;Red &amp; Black&quot; features local and national news, student opinion, and college athletics coverage. During the 1860s, students published a satirical newspaper called &quot;The Bogus Tract.&quot;

The college radio station, WNJR broadcasts on the FM broadcast band. Assisted by a faculty advisor from the Department of Theater and Communication, the student-run studio broadcasts in a freeform format with both nationally syndicated programs and Pittsburgh-based independent programs. Student on-air personalities produce radio programs including music, news, talk, and sports. It serves the Pittsburgh Designated Market Area, reaching north to the northern Pittsburgh suburbs, east to Monessen, south to Waynesburg and west to the West Virginia Panhandle.

&quot;The Wooden Tooth Review&quot; is a student-edited literary journal, featuring short fiction and poetry submitted by members of the student body. The editorial board is organized as a recognized student club, with a faculty advisor. The journal was founded in 1999, with V. Penelope Pelizzon, Coordinator of Creative Writing, serving as the first faculty advisor. The college&#x27;s yearbook, &quot;Pandora&quot;, is produced annually by a student staff.

===Literary societies===
The history of literary societies at Washington &amp; Jefferson College dates back to the 1797, when the Franklin Literary Society and the Philo Literary Society were founded at Canonsburg Academy. Two other literary societies were founded at Washington College, the Union Literary Society in 1809 and the Washington Literary Society in 1814. Typical early activities include the presentation of dialogues, translations of passages from Greek or Latin classics, and extemporaneous speaking. Later, the literary societies began to present declamations. Each society maintained independent libraries for the use of their members, each of which rivaled the holdings of their respective colleges. These four college literary societies had intense rivalries with each other, competing in &quot;contests&quot;, which pitted select society members against another in &quot;compositions, speaking select orations and debating&quot;, with the trustees selecting the victor. Because the two colleges never met each other in athletic contests, these literary competitions were the main outlet for their rivalry. In the years after the union of the two colleges, these four literary societies merged with the Franklin Literary Society, which survives today.

===Art scene===
Washington &amp; Jefferson College is home to a vibrant student art and musical scene. The artistic center of campus is the Olin Fine Arts Center, with an art gallery and a 486-seat auditorium. On the academic side, the Department of Art offers majors in studio art and art education, as well as a concentration in graphic design. The Department of Music offers majors and minors in music. The Department of Theatre and Communications offers a major and minor in theatre. Current musical organizations include the W&amp;J Wind Ensemble, the W&amp;J Jazz Ensemble, the W&amp;J Choir and the Camerata Singers. Former musical organizations include the Banjo, Mandolin &amp; Guitar Club and the College Band. Every year since 2003, the Theatre and Communication Department has produced the &quot;Winter Tales&quot; series, an annual production of one-act plays written by members of the W&amp;J community, students, alumni, faculty, administration, and staff, and produced by the W&amp;J Student Theater Company.

In addition to student-produced art and music, the college provides a number of opportunities to view art and music from the larger art community. The college holds a collection of paintings by distinguished regional artist Malcolm Parcell, which are displayed in several locations on campus. The most prominent location is the Malcolm Parcell Room in The Commons, which is part of the student dining area. The W&amp;J Arts Series is an annual collection of musicians, singers, and other artistic performers appearing at the Olin Fine Arts Center. Past shows have included Di Wu, Habib Koité, Chris Potter, The Aquila Theatre Company presenting &quot;The Invisible Man,&quot; Eroica Trio, Oni Buchanan, Tommy Sands, Cavani String Quartet, Sergio and Odar Assad, and Sandip Burman. In 1999, billionaire W&amp;J alum and well-known opera philanthropist Alberto Vilar sponsored the Vilar Distinguished Artist Series. During its run, the series hosted, among others, Lorin Maazel conducting the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Valery Gergiev conducting the Kirov Orchestra, Camerata Salzburg with Murray Periaha, St. Petersburg Classic Ballet, Vienna State Opera Ballet, Susan Graham, Jennifer Larmore, Samuel Ramey, Barbara Bonney, Katia and Marielle Labèque, Angelika Kirchschlager, Simon Keenlyside, Gil Shaham, and Jessye Norman. In 2003, amid Vilar&#x27;s falling fortunes, the series went on a hiatus, and Vilar&#x27;s 2005 indictment for financial fraud ended the series. In Fall 2003, the W&amp;J Arts Series, the college&#x27;s other art series, was expanded to partially compensate.

===Greek life===
43% of women and 40% of men of the student body participating in Greek life. &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; named Washington &amp; Jefferson College 12th on their 2010 list of &quot;Major Frat and Sorority Scene&quot; in the United States. As of 2022, there were four fraternities and four sororities. All Greek organizations occupy college-owned houses on Chestnut Street.

Two national fraternities were founded at Jefferson College, Phi Gamma Delta in 1848 and Phi Kappa Psi in 1852. A third fraternity was founded at Jefferson College, Kappa Phi Lambda, but it dissolved after a decade of existence amid a dispute between chapters. In 1874, a fourth fraternity was founded at W&amp;J, the short-lived Phi Delta Kappa. The new fraternity grew to several chapters before falling apart in 1880.

==Athletics==

===Intercollegiate===
W&amp;J competes in 26 varsity sports at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III level. As of the 2009–10 academic year, the Presidents have won more than 108 Presidents&#x27; Athletic Conference (PAC) championships, 40 students were selected as conference Most Valuable Player, more than 300 athletes were awarded First Team All-Conference recognition, 75 received All-American honors, and 25 achieved Academic All-American status. During the 2005–2006 season, 34 percent of the student body played varsity-level athletics.

The football team has been very successful, winning 18 out of the last 21 PAC Championships and advancing to the NCAA Division III playoffs 17 times. W&amp;J played to a 0–0 tie in the 1922 Rose Bowl against the California Golden Bears and were named to a share of the national championship by the Boand System. In 1923, John Heisman coached the W&amp;J football team. The men&#x27;s ice hockey team won the 2008 College Hockey Mid America Conference championship, a Division I regional league of the American Collegiate Hockey Association. W&amp;J also fields teams in field hockey, men&#x27;s wrestling, baseball, softball, and women&#x27;s volleyball, as well as men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country running, soccer, tennis, water polo, basketball, swimming and diving, golf, lacrosse, and track &amp; field. Men&#x27;s volleyball and women&#x27;s wrestling will be added in the 2026–27 school year.

===Intramural===
The intramural sports program is one of the most consistently popular activities at Washington &amp; Jefferson College, providing non-varsity and recreational athletic activities for all students, faculty, and staff of the college. Vicki Staton, a former varsity women&#x27;s basketball and volleyball coach, manages the intramural program. In 2002, 60% of students participated in intramural sports. In 2006, more than 40% of the student body participated in intramural athletics. In 2007, the intramural activities included 3-on-3 basketball, billiards, bowling, flag football, kickball, tennis, ultimate frisbee, volleyball, wallyball, ping pong, and Texas hold &#x27;em. Intramural champions win a T-shirt celebrating their victory.

While the varsity athletics program was struggling during the 1930s, intramural participation topped 84% of the student population. During that time, the management of intramural activities was transferred to the athletic department, allowing the intramural program to use the college&#x27;s varsity facilities. In the 1930s and 1940s, groups of students competed for the &quot;Big Cup,&quot; a trophy given to the most outstanding team, as judged by a cross-sport point system.

==Traditions==
One of the oldest traditions at Washington &amp; Jefferson College was the &quot;Freshman Rules,&quot; a system of rules and restrictions on freshmen. Failure by freshmen to follow these rules would subject them to beatings by upperclassmen or other punishments doled out by the &quot;Freshman Court.&quot; During the 1870s and 1880s, the students engaged in organized athletic competitions, pitting the freshman versus sophomore classes in the &quot;Olympic Games&quot; that involved elaborate opening ceremonies and the smoking of a &quot;Pipe of Peace.&quot; Another form of physical contest between the freshman and sophomore classes were the annual &quot;color rush,&quot; where the teams fought over control over strips of fabric, the &quot;pole rush,&quot; where the teams battled to raise a flag up a flagpole, and the &quot;cane rush&quot; where the teams fought over control over a ceremonial cane. These contests generally devolved into outright gang violence.

The college cheer, &quot;&quot;, is so pervasive in college history and culture that in addition to being shouted during academic ceremonies and football games, it is also used as a salutation in correspondence between alumni. The college&#x27;s fight song, &quot;&quot; is sung to the tune of &quot;99 Bottles of Beer&quot; and makes fun of a number of rival colleges, including the University of Pittsburgh, but was modified sometime before 1958 to laud Washington Female Seminary. For a large portion of the college&#x27;s history, there was no official alma mater, but there were a number of other tradition hymns and songs.

===Symbols of the college===

The college&#x27;s coat of arms features a two-part shield based on the coats of arms of the Jefferson and Washington families. The top portion, showing two towers, representing Washington College and Jefferson College, and three stars, representing the McMillan, Dod, and Smith log cabins. The lower portion, showing an interlocked design that in heraldry is called a fret, is adapted from Jefferson&#x27;s coat of arms and the colors, red and black, is taken from the Washington coat of arms. The coat of arms may appear with a banner underneath showing the college motto. The design was adopted in 1902 in celebration of Jefferson College&#x27;s centennial. It was designed by Rev. Harry B. King, class of 1891. Upon its adoption, it was described as &quot;a happy combination, and makes a very neat appearance when worn as a pin or button.&quot;

The college seal displays two brick towers, with one labeled &quot;1802,&quot; representing Jefferson College, and the other labeled &quot;1806,&quot; representing Washington College. The union of the two colleges is represented by a bridge between the two towers, with Roman numerals reading 1865, the year of union. Banners hanging from the towers show the college motto of &quot;Juncta Juvant.&quot; The creation of the seal is unknown, with the first known use occurring during the 1902 centennial celebration of Jefferson College&#x27;s founding. The seal is used in official documents, including diplomas and certificates.

The college&#x27;s current logo features a stylized version of the two towers of Old Main, symbolizing the 1865 unification of Washington College and Jefferson College. The logo may be displayed in several versions: with the entire name of the college, the shortened form of &quot;W&amp;J&quot;, or without any text. Prior to the adoption of this logo, the college&#x27;s graphic identity consisted of a variety of conflicting logos and type styles.

==Relations with the city of Washington==

Relations between the city of Washington, Pennsylvania and Washington &amp; Jefferson College span over two centuries, dating to the founding of both the city and the college in the 1780s. The relationship between the town and college was strong enough that the citizens of Washington offered a $50,000 donation in 1869 to the college in a successful attempt to lure the trustees to select Washington over nearby Canonsburg as the consolidated location of the college. The relationship encountered challenges the 20th century, with disagreements arising between the college and residential neighborhoods as the college pursued an expansion plan. Preservationists unsuccessfully attempted to pass laws prohibiting the college from demolishing certain buildings that were listed on the East Washington Historic District. Local preservationists also unsuccessfully tried to block the demolition of Hays Hall, which had been condemned. In the 1990s, the city of Washington made several unsuccessful attempts to challenge the college&#x27;s tax-exempt status. In 1993, Washington appealed the Washington County Board of Assessment&#x27;s determination that the college was exempt from the city&#x27;s property tax. That case went to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the college. In response, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a new law clarifying that colleges were exempt from taxation, including from local property taxes. Separately, the city of Washington passed an ordinance that levied a municipal &quot;service fee&quot; against the college students, which was ruled to be illegal and was struck down. In the late 1990s, the college and town created the &quot;Blueprint for Collaboration&quot;, a plan with detailed goals and benchmarks for the future to help the college and the city work together on economic development, environmental protection, and historic preservation.

==Notable alumni==
As of 2009, Washington &amp; Jefferson College had about 12,000 living alumni. Before the union of the two colleges, Washington College graduated 872 men and Jefferson College graduated 1,936 men. These alumni include James G. Blaine, who served in Congress as Speaker of the House, U.S. Senator from Maine, two-time United States Secretary of State and the Republican nominee for the 1884 presidential election.

<doc id="745139" wikidata="Q942284" url="?curid=745139" title="Lutheran World Federation">
<text>The Lutheran World Federation (LWF; ) is a global communion of national and regional Lutheran denominations headquartered in the Ecumenical Centre in Geneva, Switzerland. The federation was founded in the Swedish city of Lund in the aftermath of the Second World War in 1947 to coordinate the activities of the many differing Lutheran churches. Since 1984, the member churches are in pulpit and altar fellowship, with common doctrine as the basis of membership and mission activity.

The LWF now has 150 member church bodies in 99 countries representing over 78 million Lutherans; as of 2023, it was the sixth-largest Christian communion (see list of denominations by membership). The LWF acts on behalf of its member churches in areas of common interest such as ecumenical and interfaith relations, theology, humanitarian assistance, human rights, communication, and the various aspects of mission and development work.

The Department for World Service is the LWF&#x27;s humanitarian and development arm. It has programmes in 24 countries and is the UNHCR ninth largest implementing partner. The LWF is a member of ACT Alliance.

On 31 October 1999, in Augsburg, Germany, the LWF signed the &quot;Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification&quot; with the Roman Catholic Church. The &quot;Catholic–Lutheran dialogue&quot; is a series of discussions that began during July 1964 as an outgrowth of the Second Vatican Council. The statement is an attempt to narrow the theological divide between the two faiths. The declaration also states that the mutual condemnations between 16th-century Catholic church and Lutheranism no longer apply. A similar event took place in Lund Cathedral on 31 October 2016, the 499th anniversary of the beginning of the Protestant Reformation, with the signing of the &quot;Statement on the 500th anniversary of the Protestant Reformation with Pope Francis and Bishop Munib Younan in a special Catholic-Lutheran dialogue&quot;.

119 of the 145 member churches (80%) ordain women as ministers.

== History ==
The LWF was founded at Lund, Sweden, in 1947. Based in Geneva, Switzerland, it replaced the more informal Lutheran World Convention, which had been founded in 1924. The goal was to coordinate international activities of the many Lutheran churches, to provide a forum for discussions on theological and organizational issues, and to assist in philanthropy, missionary activity, and exchange of students and professors. A key leader was Executive Secretary Sylvester C. Michelfelder (1889–1951), representing the American Lutheran Church. He had been a leader in organizing $45 million in American help for the rebuilding of Protestant churches in Germany after 1945. By the time of his death in 1951, the federation represented 52 churches in 25 countries.

The President is the federation&#x27;s chief official representative and spokesperson. The president presides at meetings of the Assembly, Council and Meeting of Officers, and oversees the life and work of the federation in consultation with the General Secretary.

===General Secretary===
The Lutheran World Federation Council elects the General Secretary for a seven-year term. The person appointed is eligible for re-election. The General Secretary conducts the business of the federation assisted by the Communion Office Leadership Team, comprising department and unit heads appointed by the council, and carries out the decisions of the Assembly and Council. On 19 June 2021, the LWF Council elected Estonian theologian Anne Burghardt as the next General Secretary. She is the first woman to serve in this role and assumed office on 1 November of that year.

==Views on same-sex unions==
Some member denominations have recognized same-sex unions through marriage, a blessing rite, or special prayers. These include the Church of Denmark, Church of Iceland, Church of Norway, Church of Sweden, Protestant Church A.B. in Austria, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, Evangelical Lutheran Church of Chile, Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, Evangelical Lutheran Church in Geneva, Evangelical Lutheran Church in Italy, a majority of the churches within the Protestant Church in Germany, Evangelical Church of the River Plate, Protestant Church in the Netherlands, and the United Protestant Church of France.

On the other side, several churches, including the Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus, Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania, the Malagasy Lutheran Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Lithuania, which recognize marriage as solely the union between a man and a woman, have broken ties with many of the churches supporting same-sex unions.

The Evangelical Church of the Lutheran Confession in Brazil supports civil same-sex marriage, but does not allow its ministers to celebrate same-sex unions, neither does it ordain ministers who are living in same-sex unions.

<text>Archbishop Molloy High School (also called Molloy, Archbishop Molloy, or AMHS) is a co-educational, college preparatory, Catholic school for grades 9–12, located on on 83-53 Manton Street, Briarwood, Queens, New York. It is part of the Diocese of Brooklyn.

Molloy has an endowment of $11.3 million (as of 2019). The school&#x27;s current principal is Darius Penikas, who started his term in 2015. Molloy&#x27;s motto is &quot;Non Scholae Sed Vitae,&quot; which is Latin for &quot;Not For School, But For Life&quot;.

==History==
The school is staffed by the Marist Brothers, founded by Saint Marcellin Champagnat.

In 1892, Br. Zephiriny opened St. Ann&#x27;s Academy in two brownstone buildings at East 76 Street and Lexington Avenue. Initially a parish elementary school, the program expanded to include a two-year commercial course and then a four-year high school program. Initially conducted entirely in French, the school moved to English-language instruction, and by the 20th century, the Brothers anglicized the name to St. Ann&#x27;s. During the Theodore Roosevelt era, the school briefly took on a military air, with uniforms and a marching band. Boarding facilities were added. When the original parish church was replaced in 1912 with the present-day church, the Brothers acquired the old building and converted it as a gymnasium. A purpose-built five-story school building was then constructed, and other neighboring buildings were acquired.

65 years after its foundation, the school enrollment was 800 in grades one through twelve, and all available buildings were full. Some of the earliest buildings had deteriorated structurally, and required replacement.

Archbishop Thomas Edmund Molloy, the Ordinary of the Diocese of Brooklyn, offered the Marist Brothers a site he had purchased in central Queens County. In 1957, the Brothers moved to the new site, naming the building in honor of Archbishop Molloy. The building received an award from the Queens Chamber of Commerce&#x27;s annual architectural competition in 1957. The expanded facilities had the school nearly double its enrollment.
In 1956, at the request of the Diocesan bishop, Archbishop Thomas E. Molloy, a high school in East Elmhurst was opened as Msgr. McClancy Memorial High School in honor of Msgr. Joseph V. McClancy&#x27;s priestly, energetic, scholarly nature as he contributed so much to Catholic Education.

In 1987, the Ralph DiChiaro Center for Arts and Sciences was dedicated.

In 2000, Molloy became co-educational. It graduated its first female in 2004.

Richard Karsten, class of 1981, was appointed President of Molloy in July 2010. He served on the school&#x27;s first director in the 1990s and is a member of the Stanner Hall of Fame.

===Stanner===

&quot;Stanner&quot; is a word created by Archbishop Molloy High School. Before modern-day Molloy was built in Briarwood, Queens, the school was named St. Ann&#x27;s Academy. The students were known as &quot;St. Ann-ers,&quot; a nickname which, over time, simply became &quot;Stanners.&quot; All of Molloy&#x27;s students, current and alumni, are known as Stanners.

Several things in the school have this name, including the school newspaper, &quot;The Stanner&quot;. The school&#x27;s athletic teams are also known as the Stanners.

==Academics==

The U.S. Department of Education recognized the school as a &quot;National School of Excellence.&quot; Molloy was named as 1 of 96 most &quot;Outstanding American High School&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in 1999, as well as an &quot;Exemplary School&quot; by the United States Department of Education.

<text>New York Medical College (NYMC or New York Med) is a private medical school in Valhalla, New York. Founded in 1860, it is a member of the Touro University System.

NYMC offers advanced degrees through its three schools: the School of Medicine (SOM), the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBMS) and the School of Health Sciences and Practice (SHSP). Total enrollment is 1,660 students (including 774 medical students) in addition to 800 residents and clinical fellows. NYMC employs 1,350 full-time faculty members and 1,450 part-time and voluntary faculty. The university has more than 12,000 alumni active in medical practice, healthcare administration, public health, teaching and research.

Part of the Touro University System since 2011, New York Medical College is located on a shared suburban 600-acre campus with its academic medical center, Westchester Medical Center (WMC) and the Maria Fareri Children&#x27;s Hospital. Many of NYMC&#x27;s faculty provide patient care, teach, and conduct research at WMC. New York Medical College&#x27;s university hospital, Metropolitan Hospital Center, in the Upper East side neighborhood of Yorkville and East Harlem in Manhattan, has been affiliated with NYMC since it was founded in 1875, representing the oldest partnership between a hospital and a private medical school in the United States. Metropolitan is part of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC), the largest municipal hospital and healthcare system in the country.

With a network of 20+ affiliated hospitals in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and West Virginia, NYMC&#x27;s hospital affiliations include large urban medical centers, small suburban clinics, rural medical centers and high-tech regional tertiary care facilities, where medical students and residents are afforded a wide variety of clinical training opportunities.

==History==


New York Medical College owes its founding in 1860 to a group of civic leaders who believed that medical studies should be practiced with a better understanding of what the patient needs. This group of civic leaders was led by the noted poet William Cullen Bryant who was an editor of the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot;. Bryant was concerned about the condition of hospitals and medical education in New York City. His main concern was with some of the medical practices being used to treat disease, which at the time included bleedings, purges, and the administration of strong drugs in too large doses.

Interest in the medical field rapidly grew over the next few years due to the United States Civil War, which generated a major need for health related occupations. As a result, the college was founded and opened as the Homeopathic Medical College of the State of New York on the corner of 20th Street and Third Avenue, near Union Square in Manhattan. In the first semester there were 59 students and 8 professors. The college adopted the name New York Homeopathic Medical College in 1869 and, in 1887, New York Homeopathic Medical College and Hospital.

The sister institution known as the New York Medical College and Hospital for Women was founded a few years later in 1863 by Clemence Lozier. In 1867, it graduated Emily Stowe, the first female physician to practice in Canada. Three years later in 1870, Susan McKinney Steward graduated as the first African-American female physician in New York State. One of its later graduates, Adelaide Wallerstein in the class of 1905, also held a law degree, and founded the East Side Clinic for Children in 1906. When the Women&#x27;s College closed in 1918, its students transferred to New York Medical College.

In 1875, Metropolitan Hospital Center opened as a municipal facility on Ward&#x27;s Island, staffed largely by the faculty of New York Medical College. As a university hospital of New York Medical College, this relationship is among the nation&#x27;s oldest continuing affiliations between a private medical school and a public hospital.

Built by New York Medical College in 1889, the Flower Free Surgical Hospital, was the first teaching hospital in the United States to be owned by a medical college. It was constructed at York Avenue and 63rd Street with funds given largely by Congressman Roswell P. Flower, later governor of New York. In 1908 the college changed its name to New York Homeopathic Medical College and Flower Hospital. In 1928 the college was the first medical school in the nation to establish a minority scholarship program. By 1935, the college had transferred its outpatient activities to the Fifth Avenue Hospital at Fifth Avenue and 106th Street. The college (including Flower Hospital) and Fifth Avenue Hospital merged in 1938 and became New York Medical College, Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospitals.

In 1972, New York Medical College moved to Valhalla, at the invitation of the Westchester County government, which desired to build an academic medical center. Completed in 1977, Westchester Medical Center is the main academic medical center of the college. The college became affiliated with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York in 1978, which helped provide financial stability and also established a shared commitment for the public good in the area of health care and the health sciences. The college recognized itself in the Catholic tradition and affiliated with several Catholic hospitals. When Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospital closed in 1979, the remaining operations of New York Medical College were transferred to the Valhalla campus. The college shortened its name to New York Medical College in 1982.

In 2010, the NYMC community celebrated the 150th anniversary of the founding of NYMC with a year full of sesquicentennial celebration activities. In that same year, it was announced that Touro College, a Jewish-sponsored institution in Manhattan had reached an agreement to assume the sponsorship role for New York Medical College from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. In a ceremony held at Bryant Park in New York City on May 25, 2011, New York Medical College officially joined the Touro University System creating one of the largest health sciences universities in the country. New York Medical College embraces its unique history in having been a secular institution to an institution in the Roman Catholic tradition, to now being part of a Jewish-sponsored institution of higher education.

In 2011, St. Joseph&#x27;s Medical Center in Paterson, New Jersey and Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, New York were designated as affiliates. Saint Michael&#x27;s Medical Center in Newark, New Jersey; Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York; and the Beckley Department of Veterans Affairs in Beckley, West Virginia, also joined NYMC in 2014 as academic affiliates adding to the breadth and diversity of clinical experiences for students and residents.

In 2013, NYMC acquired the building an old IBM Research building at 19 Skyline Drive in Hawthorne, a 250,000 square foot, five-story building which provides essential space for offices and new programs. In addition, NYMC acquired 7 Dana Road and has renovated it into a state-of-the-art biotechnology incubator (BioInc@NYMC) and Clinical Skills and Disaster Medicine Training Center.

In 2016, whimsical caricatures were added along the campus walkway. NYMC restored statues that were originally part of the children&#x27;s wing of Grasslands Hospital (known today as NYMC&#x27;s Sunshine Cottage Administration Building). The statues, along with the animal adornments on the building itself, were created to raise the spirits of sick children who were once treated here. The statues are thought to have been modeled after characters in English author Lewis Carroll&#x27;s novel Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland (1865). The statues live along the walkway that leads to Dana Road.

On June 8, 2017, New York Medical College opened the Center of Excellence in Precision Responses to Bioterrorism and Disasters. The center is the twelfth center of excellence in the state of New York, and the first in the Hudson Valley. The goal of the center is to maximize efficiency and effectiveness immediately after high-casualty events like terrorist attacks or natural disasters by improving resources provided to first responders. Additionally, the center provides training for responses to terror attacks and natural disasters, as well as researches response techniques to chemical and biological terror challenges. State Senator Terrence Murphy, a major supporter of state funding for the center, said the center &quot;gives the region a vitally needed local resource to fight terrorism and potentially protect the lives of first responders and our families.&quot;

After Empire State Development, New York state&#x27;s economic development organization, designated the facility as a center of excellence, New York Medical College received a state grant of $500,000 for costs associated with operations. Explaining New York&#x27;s goal for the center, Dr. Robert W. Amler, dean of the School of Health Sciences and Practice, said, &quot;The state wants to bring innovation technology into each region in a way that will stimulate more outside investment from the federal government and private resources.&quot; In the future, New York Medical College, through the center, aims to achieve full development of an &quot;austere medicine&quot; training facility for first responders, including scenarios they will likely encounter in reality, like active shooter threats, fires, and car accidents. In this aspect of training, trainees must encounter smoke, fog, loud noises, explosion simulations, and a variety of other disorienting effects.

==Schools==

===Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBMS)===

The college&#x27;s involvement in graduate education dates back to 1910 when its records show the existence of advanced courses and research programs. Graduate courses in surgery and medicine were offered in the 1920s. In 1938, the college&#x27;s charter was amended to include the authority to offer graduate degrees. In 1963, the Graduate School of Medical Sciences was officially founded, establishing for the first time a center for graduate education separate from the medical curriculum. The school was renamed the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences in 2022.

The GSBMS prepares future researchers, teachers, senior-level scientists and technicians to work in academia and industry. It is in the Basic Sciences Building along with facilities of the School of Medicine. The graduate school has approximately 150 enrolled students and 90 faculty members. It offers doctor of philosophy, Master of Science, and a M.D./Ph.D. dual degree program for current and prospective medical students.

===School of Health Sciences and Practice (SHSP)===

The School of Health Sciences and Practice began in 1981 as the Graduate School of Health Sciences, located at Vosburgh Pavilion near the School of Medicine and Westchester Medical Center. Student enrollment is approximately 500 with 221 faculty members (150 full-time).

The SHSP offers accredited programs in public health (MPH, DrPH), speech language pathology (MS), and doctor of physical therapy (DPT). Doctoral students may pursue a dual degree (M.D./MPH) or joint degree (DPT/MPH) at significantly reduced cost.

===School of Medicine (SOM)===
Founded in 1860, the School of Medicine at New York Medical College is one of the oldest in the nation. It is the largest of the three graduate schools, awarding approximately 190 Doctor of Medicine degrees per year. Students have the opportunity to earn dual degrees such as M.D./M.P.H., M.D./M.S. or M.D./Ph.D. in the School of Health Sciences and Practice or Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences

The School of Medicine has 774 actively enrolled students (31% in-state) along with 2,944 faculty members serving in 6 basic science and 20 clinical departments. Grading is Honors/High Pass/Pass/Fail. On-campus housing is provided for most preclinical students in furnished, unfurnished, single or married configurations.

The medical school has adopted the multiple mini interview system as well as the CASPer test, both developed by McMaster University Medical School to select students for admissions.

The class entering in 2022 had an average 3.6 GPA and an average 515 MCAT score. 21% of students self-reported as members of groups underrepresented in medicine.

In 2009, the passing rate for the USMLE Step 1 exam was between 99 and 100%, above the national average. , 13,270 physicians had graduated from the School of Medicine with 97% of them board-certified. Approximately 917 graduates had served on an American medical school faculty, including 18 department chairs.

===Rankings===
For 2024, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked the college tied for #101 for Research and #112-123 for Primary Care out of 193 medical schools.

==Affiliated hospitals and organizations==

Located on campus, Westchester Medical Center is the main academic medical center of New York Medical College School of Medicine.

<text>Martin Stephan (1777–1846) was pastor of St. John Lutheran Church in Dresden, Germany during the early 19th century. He organized the Saxon emigration to the United States in the early 19th century.

== Biography ==
Martin Stephan was born August 13, 1777, in Stramberg, Moravia, presently the Czech Republic, of Austrian, German, and Czech parents. Martin attended St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Gymnasium in Breslau, sponsored by local pietist and pastor Johann Ephraim Scheibel, rector of the gymnasium and father of Johann Gottfried Scheibel, a professor at the University of Breslau. He then attended the University of Halle and the University of Leipzig from 1804 to 1809.

Stephan became pastor in Haber, Bohemia, in 1809. In 1810, Martin became the pastor of St. John&#x27;s in Dresden, a specially chartered church that had its origins in those who had fled from Moravia and Bohemia in 1650. Stephan preached in Czech and German. For the next 30 years, Martin was known for his teaching, preaching, and compassionate counseling. He led the protest against oppressive practices by the Saxon State Consistory in the state-governed Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Saxony. He came under attack by the rationalist pastors for his confessional and orthodox stand. Stephan continued to uphold biblical and sacramental practices in his church.

In 1824, Stephan began to consider America as a place to practice the faith without harassment. He and ten other men formed a or society for emigration from Dresden to St. Louis, Missouri. He organized the emigration of 665 people in November 1838 from Bremen to New Orleans on five ships. When four of the five the ships landed at the Port of New Orleans, Martin Stephan was elected bishop of this small band of Lutherans, according to the travel regulations of the Emigration Society. Forster indicates that Stephan was made bishop initially only by the passengers and clergy on board the &quot;Olbers&quot; at about the time this ship entered the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Forster states, &quot;On January 14, 1839...they made Stephan their bishop and endowed him with a liberal grant of power to carry out the functions of his office.&quot; Only four of the five immigrant ships arrived safely in New Orleans (the &quot;Amalia&quot; never arrived) and the ships arrived at varying times over the course of a couple of weeks. Of note, after his appointment, it was Stephan who originated the practice of kissing the bishop&#x27;s hand.

After two months, the Saxon immigrants purchased land in Perry County, Missouri, at the confluence of Brazeau Creek and the Mississippi River. Here they built homes, towns, schools, and churches. The organization of the community was disrupted when Stephan was accused of sexual misconduct (as he had previously been in Germany). Pastors G. H. Loeber and C. F. W. Walther told lay leaders of this confession. Walther made two trips to Perry County to prepare Stephan&#x27;s deposition.

Stephan soon became embroiled in additional allegations. On May 30, 1839, Stephan was deposed and excommunicated from the community on the grounds of sexual misconduct and embezzlement, leaving C. F. W. Walther as the senior clergyman. Stephan was put across the river to wilderness near Kaskaskia, Illinois, followed by one of the women with whom he had been accused of consorting, and who stayed with him until his death.

Stephan continued to hold worship in the county court house in Kaskaskia every two weeks. He taught German and guest-preached in other Protestant churches until called in 1845 as a pastor to Trinity Lutheran Church in Horse Prairie, a rural church a few miles east of Red Bud, Illinois. Stephan was pastor there for four months until his death on February 26, 1846, in Prairie, Illinois. According to the custom, Stephan&#x27;s coffin was carried around the church three times before he was interred in Trinity&#x27;s cemetery. A fence was placed around the grave and a wooden cross was erected. A memorial marker was erected by the congregation in 1988.

<text>&quot;Dual power&quot; (), sometimes referred to as counterpower, refers to a strategy in which alternative institutions coexist with and seek to ultimately replace existing authority, such as the coexistence of two Russian governments as a result of the February Revolution: the Soviets (workers&#x27; councils), particularly the Petrograd Soviet, and the Russian Provisional Government. The term was first used by the communist Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin (1870–1924) in the 1917 &quot;Pravda&quot; article titled &quot;The Dual Power&quot;.

Lenin argued that this essentially unstable situation constituted a unique opportunity for the Soviets and Bolsheviks to seize power by smashing the weak Provisional Government and establishing themselves as the basis of a new form of state power.

This notion has informed the strategies of subsequent communist-led revolutions elsewhere in the world, including the Chinese Communist Revolution led by Mao Zedong (1893–1976) after the Chinese Civil War (1927–1949) and in eastern Europe after World War II (1939–1945).

== Background ==

After Tsar Nicholas II abdicated the throne, the resulting February Revolution led to the establishment of the Provisional Government and its counterpart, the Petrograd Soviet. The Provisional Government was composed of former State Duma representatives with approval from the Petrograd Soviet, whereas the Petrograd Soviet was made up of socialist leaders elected by a proletariat constituency. With the Russian government moving from an autocracy to this system of &quot;dual power&quot; with the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet constantly vying for power, there was much confusion on how both could coexist and govern effectively.

In this confusion, the Provisional Government realized the Soviet had the people&#x27;s trust and enthusiasm. In the hopes of appeasing the Soviet and keeping the support of the population, the Provisional Government launched several very bold liberal acts and promoted civil liberties through means of freedom of speech, press, and assembly. Yet, other than strategic political motives, the Provisional Government understood that their power was illegitimate, due to the fact that they were not elected by the people. To solve the problem of illegitimacy, the Provisional Government was in the process of establishing the Constituent Assembly, whose members would be democratically elected by the people. The Constituent Assembly would never come to be under the Provisional Government&#x27;s rule, as the elections were set after the Bolsheviks seized power in the October Revolution.

After the February Revolution, Lenin published his April Theses and in it he expressed unhappiness with the February Revolution as he described it as a &quot;Bourgeois Revolution&quot;. He pushed for the slogan &quot;All Power to the Soviets&quot;. Lenin mentioned that a Proletarian Revolution was necessary, and expressed that he had no interest in cooperating with the Provisional Government or the other Soviet leaders who were willing to compromise. Other members of Soviet leadership were skeptical of Lenin&#x27;s ideas since they were afraid that Lenin and the Bolsheviks were advocating for anarchism. Lenin also criticized the Petrograd Soviet for governing alongside the Provisional Government, and accused them of forgetting and abandoning socialist ideas and the proletarian revolution.

== Provisional Government ==

The Provisional Government&#x27;s members primarily consisted of former State Duma members under Nicholas II&#x27;s reign. Its members were mainly members of the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party and conservative Octobrist party, but also included one Progressivist and one Trudovik. The ideological and political ideas differed wildly throughout the party&#x27;s leadership and members, but most were moderates, offering both liberal and conservative views at times. The Kadets and the Provisional Government alike pushed for new policies including the release of political prisoners, a decree of freedom of press, cessation of the Okhrana, abolition of the death penalty, and rights for minorities. The Provisional Government and the Kadets also wanted Russia to continue to be involved in World War I, much to the dismay of the Soviets. Despite certain political ideas, the Kadets became slightly more conservative overall with the rise of left-wing parties and left-wing thought within both the Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet. The Provisional Government realized that their power was not legitimate since they were former Duma members, and not elected by a general public. They knew that to be seen as a legitimate government body, they would need to be elected by the people, and they established the Constituent Assembly and scheduled popular elections to take place later in the year.

Alexander Kerensky, a former member of the Fourth Duma and a chairman of the Soviet Executive Committee and eventually the Prime Minister for the Provisional Government, was brought into the Provisional Government as a way to gain support from left-wing parties and the Petrograd Soviet. Kerensky was a moderate socialist, and believed that cooperation with the Provisional Government was necessary. Historian S. A. Smith explains that after the appointment of Kerensky &quot;Thus was born &#x27;dual power&#x27;, an institutional arrangement under which the Provisional Government enjoyed formal authority, but where the Soviet Executive Committee had real power.&quot; The Provisional Government feared the Soviets immense growing power, and through this fear they tried to appease them as much as possible. When Kerensky became Prime Minister, he attempted to work with the Soviets including arming the Soviets and their followers during the Kornilov affair.

== Petrograd Soviet ==

The Soviet of Workers&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Deputies in Petrograd served as the voice of the smaller councils of deputies elected by commoners, specifically soldiers and workers. The Petrograd Soviet, therefore, could claim a much better understanding of the people&#x27;s will, since it was composed of many orators whom the lower class population elected. The Soviet was established after the February Revolution, composed of numerous socialist revolutionaries.

The workers and soldiers of Russia saw hope in the Petrograd soviets, and elected deputies to it &quot;en masse&quot;, causing it to gain membership at an alarming rate (1,200 seats had been filled in a week). The Petrograd Soviet was seen as a benefactor that would bring them land, bread, and peace.

The executive committee was initially made up of Nikolai Ckheidze, Matvei Skobelev, and Alexander Kerensky. To keep radical mentality from spreading and provoking a &quot;counter-revolutionary movement&quot;, they supported the Provisional Government where necessary.

== July Days&#x27; impact ==
The events of the July Days would solidify the issues of dual power within government between the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet. Between 3 and 7 July (Julian Calendar date), a Bolshevik uprising, still disputed whether intentional by Lenin, occurred. In what is seen as a &quot;grassroots&quot; uprising, workers and lower ranks of soldiers violently demonstrated in the streets, calling for the Soviet to take power over the Provisional Government. The uprising was supported by the Bolshevik Military Organization and Petersburg Committee, who sent in more support, but the leaders of the party had less concrete opinions about the demonstration.

Alexander Kerensky, head of the Provisional Government, led a crackdown on those involved with the events of the July Days and overthrow of the Provisional Government. The military was used to gather and arrest violent demonstrators, retake government buildings from Bolshevik forces, and dissolve military units that had participated in the attempted overthrow. The Provisional Government also attempted to undermine Lenin and his party by revealing their investigation of his ties to Germany, Russia&#x27;s enemy during World War I. These combined actions would quell the Bolshevik uprising and support until August 1917 (Julian).

The reinstatement of the death penalty for soldiers, and Kerensky transferring the Provisional Government into the Winter Palace were among the actions that led to accusations of counterrevolutionary activity (reestablishment of autocratic government) by the Provisional Government. A new kind of duality between the classes (proletariat and bourgeoisie) was a split noticeable not only in government, but also in everyday life for Russians. This led to increased tensions between both theaters, and made it difficult for groups to collaborate. The Petrograd Soviet represented the Proletariat, while the Provisional Government members were part of the former State Duma, representing the old government under the tsar. This divide was also evident in the military, between rank-and-file soldiers and military officers. As World War I continued on, soldiers started to mutiny or to disobey orders from their superiors, while supporting the soviets, hoping to bring an end to Russia&#x27;s involvement in the war.

== October Revolution ==
Although the Bolshevik party was largely put down after the events of the July Days, Lenin still believed that the group could gain power in government because of unsteadiness due to the dual power situation. In April he wrote that the time was not yet right for revolution, as the Petrograd Soviet was still involved and working with the Provisional Government, as well as stating, &quot;we do not as yet know a type of government superior to and better than the Soviets.&quot; With the July Days seen as &quot;Lenin&#x27;s worst blunder&quot;, even though it was not necessarily his intention, the Bolsheviks were still not in place to take over the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet.

However, with the Kornilov affair of August 1917 (Julian-style date), the Bolsheviks regained both power in their party, but also with the masses. With Kornilov&#x27;s soldiers moving towards the capital and the Provisional Government, Kerensky had released many Bolshevik leaders arrested during the July Days and also provided arms in order for the Bolsheviks to defend the Provisional Government. By arming and calling on those who he had earlier punished, the Bolsheviks saw that they truly were gaining power in the government and Russian society. The Russian population lost faith in the Provisional Government because of how it handled Kornilov&#x27;s coup, and many began supporting the Bolsheviks, with the group winning elections throughout Petrograd, especially in districts made up of the working class. This event, coupled with food shortages, the continuation of Russian involvement in World War I, and mass unemployment, worked in the Bolsheviks favor, turning people away from the government in charge and toward the party that promised &quot;Bread, Peace, Land.&quot;

When the Bolsheviks overthrew the Provisional Government during the October Revolution, they were able to do so with little resistance. The Provisional Government realized that their power was limited at the point of takeover, as the Bolsheviks had been gaining supporters and had more revolutionaries. When the actual overthrow occurred between the days of October 25 and 26 (Julian), Bolsheviks first seized means of transportation and communication, such as roads, bridges, railways, and post offices. Lenin then went to the Second Congress of Soviets of Workers&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Deputies to present the overthrow of the Provisional Government and state authority by the Bolshevik party. The Winter Palace (at the time, the home of the Provisional Government) was seized without a casualty the morning of the 26th, and the Congress had no choice but to approve Lenin&#x27;s decree. With this, the period of dual power between the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet came to a close.

== Strategy and ideological concepts ==
As the ideological monopoly of dominant institutions is broken and people increasingly rely on Alternative Institutions (AIs), those who benefited from existing arrangements may seek to dismantle their upstart competitors. At the same time, those who seek fundamental changes in society or who find the alternative ways of organizing it valuable may seek to enlarge and strengthen the alternative infrastructure. Counter institutions (XIs) are created both to defend the AIs and to promote their growth. These work to challenge and attack the status quo while creating, defending, and securing space for opposition and alternative institutions. They do this with everything from political protests, to direct appropriation (of plantations, government buildings, factories, etc.) for the use of alternative institutions, to civil disobedience or armed resistance. The line between AIs and XIs is seldom entirely clear as many alternative institutions are also self-promoting or defending. Together the AIs and XIs form an alternative source of power in society which is &quot;necessarily autonomous from, and competitive with, the dominant system, seeking to encroach upon the latter&#x27;s domain, and, eventually, to replace it.&quot;

Successful dual-power rebellions end with the acceptance of the new social forms by much of the populace and the realization by the old rulers that they are no longer capable of using their systems of force against the revolutionary movement. This can occur because noncooperation has crippled the old structures of power, because too few people remain loyal to the old rulers to enforce their will, or because the rulers themselves undergo an ideological conversion. At this point, there is not general confusion. The disappearance of old leaders and structures of power is accommodated by the expansion of the alternative system. 

The French Marxist writer and guerilla partisan Régis Debray identified the concept of dual-power with that of the movement of Trotskyism in his popular 1967 work &quot;Révolution dans la Révolution?&quot; (&quot;Revolution in the Revolution?&quot;). Within the theory of dual-power, according to Debray, the guerilla movement is subordinated to that of the vanguard party which both inhibits the flexibility of tactics available to revolutionary guerilla armies and places them in a defensive position to protect vanguard party officials and assets. Debray&#x27;s strategical framework largely identified with that of the Cuban Revolution, in particular that of Fidel Castro and Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara.

==Modern usage by libertarian socialists==

Libertarian socialists have more recently appropriated the term to refer to the strategy of achieving a libertarian socialist economy and polity by means of incrementally establishing and then networking institutions of direct participatory democracy to contest the existing power structures of state and capitalism, ultimately leading to a revolutionary rupture. This does not necessarily mean disengagement with existing institutions; for example, Yates McKee describes a dual-power approach as &quot;forging alliances and supporting demands on existing institutions – elected officials, public agencies, universities, workplaces, banks, corporations, museums – while at the same time developing self-organized counter-institutions.&quot; In this context, the strategy itself is sometimes also referred to as &quot;counterpower&quot; to differentiate it from the term&#x27;s Leninist origins.

Strategies used by libertarian socialists to build dual power include:
* Mutualism – building alternative economies through co-operatives, credit unions and local purchasing.
* Municipalism – building popular assemblies to make decisions at the community level and displace both capitalism and the modern state.
* Syndicalism – building revolutionary trade unions to confront management in the workplace and ultimately overthrow capitalism. In its anarchist form, it seeks to simultaneously abolish the state.
* Council communism – building workers&#x27; councils as revolutionary workplace and governmental structures.
* Autonomist Marxism – building a variety of independent structures until a revolutionary overtaking of the state on the path to a libertarian communist society.

==Historical examples of dual power==
* The Italian &quot;popolo&quot; in opposition to the nobles who controlled city states in the late 13th century gradually developed its own officials, who paralleled those of the commune.
* The Spanish Revolt of the Comuneros in 1520-1521 dual power in opposition to the prevailing royal administration of King Charles I.
* The Republic of Kosova and the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija
*Libya has been under dual power since the Second Libyan Civil War between the governments supported by the General National Congress and the High Council of State (National Salvation Government (2014–2017), Government of National Accord (2015–2021) and the Government of National Unity (2021–)) and the House of Representatives-supported governments (Second Al-Thani Cabinet (2014–2021) and the Government of National Stability (2022–))
* Yemen has been under dual power since the Yemeni civil war with North Yemen being controlled by the Houthi-led Supreme Political Council and South Yemen being controlled by different factions which form the Presidential Leadership Council
* Igor Strelkov, a separatist figure in eastern Ukraine, used the historical term &quot;dual power&quot; to refer to the situation in the city of Donetsk in mid-2014. Despite the presence of armed separatist militias in the city, its mayor and police forces remained loyal to Kyiv, taking orders from the Ukrainian authorities.

<text>The New York College of Podiatric Medicine (NYCPM) is a private podiatric medical school in New York City, New York. It is the oldest and second largest podiatric medical school in the United States.

==History==
Founded in 1911, NYCPM was the first podiatric medical school established in the United States. The college had its first home at 125th Street but rapidly outgrew its quarters, with three successive moves culminating in the erection in 1927 of the present College building in East Harlem, two blocks from Harlem proper. Dr. Maurice J. Lewi, a physician and educator, then serving as Secretary to the New York State Board of Examiners, was named the first president of the school.

The admission requirement for the first class in 1911 was one year of high school education. Over the years, requirements for entering students changed as the profession grew and demand for podiatric services expanded into specialized foot care and treatment programs requiring knowledge of general medical sciences, orthopedics, and surgery. Educational preparation and clinical training programs were developed to meet these requirements.

From 1939 to 1955, the college was known as the Long Island University College of Podiatry. Upon dissolution of this affiliation, the college became an independent not-for-profit institution. In 1957, it was renamed the M.J. Lewi College of Podiatry, in honor of its founder and first president. In 1972, the college received its current name, the New York College of Podiatric Medicine.

A building grant in 1976 from the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare enabled the creation of a new separate clinical training facility, an expanded library, and renovations to the existing college building. Completed in 1978, the new training facility, the Foot Center of New York, provides clinical services to the community and continues to be affiliated with the college. The Foot Center of New York serves a wide and diverse patient population with more than 25,000 patient visits annually, making it the largest foot clinic in the world.

In August 2020, it was announced a membership agreement was signed to join Touro University. The transaction closed in 2022, still pending approval by the U.S. Department of Education, the New York State Department of Education, other regulators and relevant accreditors.

As of January 2025, Touro University officially bought the NYCPM property in Harlem for $42 million as part of its acquisition of the school.

==Academics==
NYCPM&#x27;s curriculum is based on the standard program of allopathic medical education in the United States: the first two years of study are confined to the medical sciences, the latter two to the study of clinical sciences. The third and fourth years feature clinical rotations at The Foot Center of New York in general podiatry, biomechanical orthopedics including gait lab, podopediatrics, physical therapy, wound care, and radiology focusing mainly on the foot and ankle. Students also rotate through affiliated NYC Health + Hospitals teaching hospital clinics located at Metropolitan Hospital, Harlem Hospital, and Lincoln Hospital for rotations in podiatry, podiatric surgery, general surgery, internal medicine, and emergency medicine. Students complete a two-week vascular surgery rotation at Mount Sinai Hospital as well.

In recent years, NYCPM has expanded into the international educational arena with twice-yearly programs for podologists from Spain; a program at Foot Center of New York for podiatric medical students from Canada with an affiliation with their school in Quebec; and an exchange externship at University Hospital in Kraków through an affiliation with Jagiellonian University Medical College, the oldest medical school in Poland. The college has also reached out to its surrounding community, offering foot screenings at numerous neighborhood health fairs, as well as at such events as the American Diabetes Association&#x27;s annual Diabetes Expo and the Central Harlem Health Revival.

NYCPM offers a dually registered joint DPM/MPH degree, in which the Master of Public Health portion is completed at and awarded through the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

<doc id="745169" wikidata="Q1026863" url="?curid=745169" title="California State Prison, Corcoran">
<text>California State Prison, Corcoran (COR) is a male-only state prison located in the city of Corcoran, in Kings County, California. It is also known as Corcoran State Prison, CSP-C, CSP-COR, CSP-Corcoran, and Corcoran I. The facility is just north of the newer California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison, Corcoran (Corcoran II).

==Facilities==
As of Fiscal Year 2002/2003, COR had a total of 1,703 staff and an annual institutional budget of US$115 million. As of April 30, 2020, COR was incarcerating people at 119.4% of its design capacity, with 3,719 occupants. 
* Individual cells, fenced perimeters and armed coverage
* Level IV housing: Cells, fenced or walled perimeters, electronic security, more staff and armed officers both inside and outside the installation
* Security Housing Units, &quot;the most secure area[s] within a Level IV prison designed to provide maximum coverage&quot;.
* The Protective Housing Unit &amp; Death Row which holds up to 47 prisoners who require &quot;extraordinary protection from other prisoners&quot;. The unit houses inmates whose safety would be endangered by general population housing. The Protective Housing Unit has been described as &quot;strikingly calm&quot; because inmates &quot;don&#x27;t want to be moved somewhere less guarded&quot;. One violent incident occurred in March 1999 when three inmates attacked inmate Juan Corona, inflicting minor injuries, and smashed Charles Manson&#x27;s guitar. Three other Protective Housing Unit inmates suffered minor injuries.
* Acute care hospital
* Prison Industry Authority

==History==
Built on what was once Tulare Lake, the facility opened in 1988. The prison hospital was dedicated in October 1993.

In March 1993, at Corcoran, prisoner Wayne Jerome Robertson raped Eddie Dillard, a prisoner about half his size, after the latter was reassigned to his cell. Robertson, who had the nickname &quot;Booty Bandit&quot;, testified in 1999 that prison guards set up the attack. Dillard testified in the same trial. After Robertson was assigned to general population at Pelican Bay State Prison, California state senator Tom Hayden stated &quot;It is almost certain that he would be targeted for death.&quot;

In August 1996, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; claimed that COR was &quot;the most troubled of the 32 state prisons&quot;. At the time, COR officers had shot and killed more inmates &quot;than any prison in the country&quot; in COR&#x27;s eight years of existence. Seven inmates had been killed, and 50 others seriously wounded. Based on interviews and documents, Arax concluded that many shootings of prisoners were &quot;not justified&quot; and that in some cases &quot;the wrong inmate was killed by mistake&quot;. Furthermore, the article alleged that &quot;officers ... and their supervisors staged fights between inmates&quot; during &quot;gladiator days&quot;. In November 1996, CBS Evening News broadcast &quot;video footage of an inmate fatally shot by guards&quot; at COR in 1994; this death &quot;spawned a probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of alleged inmate abuses by guards&quot;.

A March 1997 episode of the &quot;CBS News 60 Minutes&quot; discussed the 1994 death, &quot;the alleged cover-up and the alarming number of shootings at the prison&quot;. The California Department of Corrections issued the results of its own investigation in November 1997, which found &quot;isolated incidents of staff misconduct&quot; but no &quot;widespread staff conspiracy&#x27; to abuse prisoners&quot;.

A film titled &quot;Maximum Security University&quot;, which used prison surveillance tapes showing four 1989–1993 fights &quot;end[ing] when a guard fatally shoots a combatant&quot;, was released in February 1998. That month, eight California correctional officers and supervisors were indicted &quot;on federal criminal civil rights charges in connection with inmate fights that occurred at Corcoran State Prison in 1994&quot;. After a trial, the eight men were &quot;acquitted of all charges&quot; in June 2000.

As of 1999 California had paid out several large prison brutality settlements for incidents at Corcoran, including $2.2 million to inmate Vincent Tulumis, paralyzed for life in a May 1993 shooting, and $825,000 for the killing of Preston Tate in April 1994.

Subsequently, COR has been featured in at least two episodes of MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Lockup&quot; series: &quot;Inside Corcoran&quot; (first aired as early as 2003) and &quot;Return to Corcoran&quot; (first aired in 2005).

In July 2013, many inmates at COR participated in a state-wide hunger strike protesting the use of solitary confinement. Billy Michael Sell, an inmate in COR who had been participating in the hunger strike, committed suicide by hanging himself while in a Security Housing Unit (SHU). He had been protesting from July 8 to July 21. Sell&#x27;s death caused significant controversy, as inmate advocates reported that fellow prisoners had heard Sell asking for medical attention for several days before his eventual suicide. His suicide triggered reviews of the circumstances behind his death at the local, state, and federal level; with Amnesty International calling for an independent inquiry into his death, one without ties to the government.

<doc id="745174" wikidata="Q1219862" url="?curid=745174" title="Die Weiße Rose (film)">
<text>Die Weiße Rose (The White Rose) is a 1982 CCC Film production about the White Rose resistance to the Nazis led by university students in Munich in 1942–1943 whose members were caught and executed in February 1943, shortly after the German capitulation at Stalingrad.

Actress Lena Stolze, who played Sophie Scholl, reprised that role in &quot;The Last Five Days,&quot; also released in 1982. That film was later remade as &quot;Sophie Scholl: The Final Days&quot; in 2005.

== Plot ==
Munich 1942: The student group White Rose, among them the Scholl siblings, have started to produce and distribute leaflets calling for resistance against Hitler and his regime. Risking their lives, they take leaflets to other cities and write slogans such as &quot;Down with Hitler&quot; on the walls of houses at night. As the Gestapo&#x27;s noose tightens around the students, they make contact with other resistance groups and even with high military officials. In early 1943, the Gestapo strikes. Hans and Sophie Scholl are arrested in the courtyard of Munich University. The People&#x27;s Court under its chairman Freisler sentences them to death. The sentence is carried out on February 22, 1943. 

In the credits, the director points out that the death sentences of the People&#x27;s Court were still legally valid at the time the film was completed. It was not until 1998 that the sentences of the People&#x27;s Court were repealed by the Law on the Repeal of National Socialist Unjust Sentences in the Administration of Criminal Justice.

==Director and stars==
Director Michael Verhoeven released another film dealing with the Nazi era, &quot;The Nasty Girl&quot;. Lena Stolze, the actress portraying Sophie Scholl, one of the White Rose participants, performed the starring role in &quot;The Nasty Girl&quot;.

==Distribution==
Distribution of the film beyond West Germany was delayed. This was because, at the time, the wartime German legal decision that outlawed the White Rose group effectively banned foreign distribution of the film, and this had to be rescinded before it could be released.

<doc id="745175" wikidata="Q14706889" url="?curid=745175" title="Manhattanville University">
<text>Manhattanville University is a private university in Purchase, New York, United States. Founded in 1841 as a school at 412 Houston Street in Lower Manhattan, it was initially known as the Academy of the Sacred Heart. In 1917, the academy received a charter from the Regents of the State of New York to raise the school officially to a collegiate level, granting degrees as the College of the Sacred Heart. In 1937, it became known as Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart, and from 1966 to 2024 as Manhattanville College.

In 1952 it moved to its current location in the hamlet of Purchase, New York, a suburb north of New York City. Purchase is inside the town and village of Harrison in Westchester County. 

Approximately 1,100 undergraduate and 900 graduate students attend Manhattanville, with students coming from 45+ countries and 35+ American states.

The architectural and administrative centerpiece of the Manhattanville campus is Reid Hall (1864) which was named after Whitelaw Reid, publisher and owner of the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;, one of the leading newspapers in the nation for a century. Next to Reid Hall stand academic buildings on one side and on the other residence halls around a central quad designed by the landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, also the designer of New York&#x27;s landmark Central Park in the 1850s and 1860s. Other historic buildings include: the Lady Chapel; the President&#x27;s Cottage known as the Barbara Debs House; the old Stables; and Water Tower.

==History==

===The Academy of the Sacred Heart (1841–1917)===
Manhattanville University traces its origins to an Academy of the Sacred Heart founded over 175 years ago on the Lower East Side of New York City. In August 1841 the Society of the Sacred Heart (RSCJ), a Catholic religious order dedicated to the education of young women, established an academy at 412 Houston Street, near the corner of Mulberry Street, in the tightly packed warren of narrow streets in the southeast corner of Manhattan Island facing the East River. This location was chosen, in part, due to its proximity to Old Saint Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral.

In September 1844 the boarding school moved to Ravenswood in the Astoria section of Queens. Archbishop John Hughes counted &quot;upon Ravenswood becoming the leading Academy for young Ladies&quot; in the Archdiocese of New York. However, within two years the location proved too remote. Of particular concern was that students were often deprived of the Mass. John McCloskey, the newly installed coadjutor bishop of New York, would personally travel there when he could, but even he &quot;could not supply for all their spiritual needs.&quot;

In 1847, the growing Academy relocated to the former estate of Jacob Lorillard in the village of Manhattanville on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in what was then a rural village. It occupied this site from 1847 to 1952 and it is from this location that the university derives its current name. At that time, the village of Manhattanville was still eight miles north of New York City, which clustered around the south end at the Battery of Manhattan Island. By the time of the American Civil War, (1861–1865), the Manhattanville Academy counted 280 girl pupils. The academy was always diverse with a substantial proportion of the student body consisting of recent immigrants from Latin America and Europe. In 1880, the academy began offering a two-year post-high school program for its young women students, foreshadowing a future in higher education.

Over the next century New York City expanded, transforming the area from a farming village to a neighborhood in West Harlem. The Convent Avenue campus was located between 130th and 135th streets. The western border was Convent Avenue and its eastern border St. Nicholas Terrace. In 1949 proceedings began to incorporate the campus into the existing City College campus. Today it is known as the South Campus of City College. The final remaining buildings from the Manhattanville era are Park Hall (then known as Benziger) and Mott Hall (the Parish School during Manhattanville&#x27;s time).

===The College of the Sacred Heart (1917–1937)===

In the early 20th century, higher education opportunities for women increased as many formerly academies, seminaries, institutions and lower schools transitioned to the status of colleges. Shortly before the United States declared war on the German Empire and entered the First World War, on March 1, 1917, the Academy of the Sacred Heart in Manhattanville received a Provisional Charter from the Regents of the State of New York to offer undergraduate degrees as &quot;The College of the Sacred Heart&quot;. The first baccalaureate degrees were granted in 1918. The Absolute Charter was signed May 29, 1919. As the college grew, the city of New York also expanded northward, toward the far north end of Manhattan Island towards the Harlem River transforming the surrounding area from a rural village to diverse residential/commercial communities of Manhattan bordered by the Harlem and Morningside Heights neighborhoods. In 1935, The College of the Sacred Heart was accredited by the prestigious Association of American Universities. The name was officially changed to &quot;Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart&quot; in 1937.

===Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart (1937–1966)===
==== Racial justice (Manhattanville Resolutions) ====

In the 1930s, the Manhattanville student body consisted of approximately 200 female students. Though small, the college made headlines across the country for taking a strong position promoting racial equality decades before the Civil Rights Movement of the late 1950s, into the 1960s and 1970s. In May 1933, students created the &quot;Manhattanville Resolutions&quot; a document that pledged an active student commitment to racial justice. This commitment was tested when the first Negro woman student was admitted to the college in 1938.

Alumnae response to a racially integrated but all-female student body was mixed and somewhat controversial for a time. While the vast majority of letters praised Manhattanville for its courageous action, college president Grace Dammann viewed the negative responses as an opportunity to open hearts and minds. At the annual Class Day reunion on May 31, 1938, she delivered a passionate speech entitled &quot;Principles Versus Prejudices.&quot; She stated that education is the key to rising above prejudices.&quot;The more we know of man&#x27;s doing and thinking throughout time and throughout the world&#x27;s extent, the more we understand that beauty and goodness and truth are not the monopoly of any age nor of any group nor of any race.&quot;The speech went on to be published in several national publications and established Manhattanville as a leader in higher education and human rights. When Dammann died suddenly in 1945, &quot;The New York Times&quot; obituary summarized her life&#x27;s work with the headline, &quot;Mother Dammann, College President: Head of Manhattanville Since 1930 Dies--Champion of Racial Equality.&quot;

Manhattanville would continue its work in social action first through the National Federation of Catholic College Students and to this day with the Duchesne Center for Religion and Social Justice and the Connie Hogarth Center for Social Action. Mary Louise (Mamie) Jenkins, RSCJ was the first African American student to graduate from Manhattanville and June Mulvaney was the first African American student to major in Russian at Manhattanville.

==== Growth ====
As was the case for many colleges following World War II, neighboring City College of New York (CCNY-part of the City University of New York) struggled to accommodate the growing college student population on its campus. In 1946, the Mayor of New York City formed a special commission to investigate the resource needs of the city&#x27;s public education institutions. Their recommendations would have particularly extensive ramifications for the future of the neighboring Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart.

In February 1949, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that City College was campaigning to acquire the Manhattanville campus to expand their facilities. The same month, CCNY distributed a pamphlet, entitled &quot;No Other Place to Go: A City College Plea for Purchase of the Manhattanville Property&quot;. The New York City Board of Estimate agreed and deeded the campus to City College via the legal process of condemnation and eminent domain. In September 1949, the Manhattanville Board of Trustees purchased the Whitelaw Reid Estate, north of the city in suburban Westchester County. The next two years saw condemnation proceedings work through the New York State Supreme Court system. Manhattanville was eventually given near $8.8 million ($8,808,620) for the Manhattan campus and buildings. A groundbreaking ceremony was held at the new campus near Harrison, in Purchase, New York on May 3, 1951. The new campus with its buildings were renovated and other construction was completed in October 1952.

===Manhattanville College (1966–2024)===

With additional facilities and space to grow, the student population increased from 400 women students in 1950 to 700 students by 1960. Over the course of the next decade, the student population doubled once again, reaching 1,400 students by 1970. Manhattanville was a microhistory of the societal transformation in the Catholic Church, higher education, and American society as a whole during the 1960s.

In 1966, the college&#x27;s board of trustees voted to amend the school charter and remove the words &quot;of the Sacred Heart&quot; from the official college name. This marked an important moment in the secularization of the college. Between 1966 and 1970, the Manhattanville administration oversaw the gradual removal of Catholic symbols and traditions from the campus. Although the college had been operated by an independent board of trustees since its founding in 1841, it was strongly identified with the Church and these changes were difficult for the community. By 1969, the college&#x27;s charter was expanded to include the admitting education of both women and men. The first coeducational freshman class entered Manhattanville in August 1971.

In 1973, the student academic experience evolved due to an important campus study funded by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Interviews with the Manhattanville community led to the development of the Portfolio System, a personalized and guided self-assessment charting the development of each student. Today the ATLAS program continues this tradition.

In 1965, the college introduced its first graduate program, a Masters of Arts in Teaching and in 1993, the first graduate programs in business were offered. The first doctoral program was introduced in 2010 with the Ed.D. in Educational Leadership from the School of Education. In 2012, Manhattanville&#x27;s Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing Degree Program was formally approved.

=== Manhattanville University (2024–present) ===
On April 3, 2024, Manhattanville College became Manhattanville University. The change was made possible, in part, because of an update in 2022 to the state Board of Regents&#x27; definition of a university.

On April 29, 2024 It was announced that Manhattanville University would maintain Wells College&#x27;s transcripts, business records, and other important artifacts after its closure.

===Presidents===

Since its chartering as a college in 1917, Manhattanville has had 16 presidents, including acting presidents, one of whom also served as interim president for a period of time:
# Mary Moran (1917–1918)

# Frank Sanchez (2023–Present)

==Current campus==

===Reid Estate (1860–1949)===
Manhattanville purchased its current 100-acre campus in 1949. The first European owner of the parcel of land was Ben Holladay who bought the estate in the 1860s and named its Ophir Farm after a silver mine in Nevada. The Holladay family built a mansion called Ophir Hall, family chapel, and several outbuildings. However, after several family deaths and financial difficulties, Ben Holladay left the estate in 1873.

In 1888 Whitelaw Reid and his wife Elisabeth Mills Reid purchased the property. Whitelaw was editor of &quot;The New York Tribune&quot; and served various political positions including ambassador to France and England. Elisabeth was the daughter of Darius Ogden Mills, founder of The Bank of California. The Reids remodeled the existing Ophir Hall and outfitted it with the latest home luxuries, including electricity. However, shortly before completion, faulty wiring sparked a fire that destroyed the home on July 14, 1888. The Reids rebuilt under the direction of the famed architectural firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White. This home was designed in the style of a gothic castle and built onto the existing foundation. The Castle was completed in 1892. A three-story addition including the East Library and West Room was completed in 1912. Whitelaw Reid died while serving as the ambassador to England in 1912. Elizabeth Mills Reid died in 1931 and the contents of the house were auctioned in 1935. In 1947 the Reid family placed the estate for sale.

Reid Castle was dedicated to Elisabeth Mills Reid on September 19, 1969. In 1974 the U.S. Department of the Interior placed the building on the National Register of Historic Places in recognition of its historical and architectural significance.

===Purchase Campus (1952–present)===
After moving from Manhattan, the new Manhattanville campus relocated to suburban Purchase, New York in Westchester County. The new campus was completed in 1952 with six buildings: a renovated Reid Castle for use as an administration building, the library, the academic building, Brownson Hall; the music building Pius X Hall; Benziger Dining Hall, and Founders Dormitory.

The increasing student population led to the addition of the Spellman Hall dormitory in 1957. The Kennedy Gymnasium, also completed in 1957, was made possible through a grant from the Lieutenant Joseph Kennedy Jr. Foundation. The Kennedy family dedicated the gymnasium in honor of their daughter, Kathleen, Marchioness of Hartington. The dedication for both the Kennedy Gymnasium and Spellman Hall were held October 27, 1957, and was presided over by Francis Cardinal Spellman, Archbishop of New York. In attendance were Joseph P. Kennedy, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy ‘11, Jean Kennedy Smith ‘49, and Ethel Skakel Kennedy ‘49. Edward M. Kennedy delivered the dedication speech.

For the first decade in Purchase, the campus worship space was located in the West Room of Reid Castle. The chapel was completed in 1963 and named in honor of the longest serving president of the college Eleanor O’Byrne, RSCJ, whose administration lasted from 1945 to 1966. Dammann and Tenney Halls were the final residence buildings completed in 1966. In 1991, forty-eight faculty and staff housing units added a new dimension to the Manhattanville campus community.

On September 26, 2006, the Manhattanville community dedicated the Ohnell Environmental Center. The center includes a classroom housed within a LEED-compliant, non-invasive structure designed by Maya Lin, architect of the Vietnam War Memorial. The project also included a restoration of the Holladay Stone Chapel, which features new stonework and a glass roof providing a unique reflective space on campus. In 2008 the Berman Center was completed. This building currently houses the Communication and Media Department, the Berger Art Gallery, the student-run radio station MVL; the school newspaper, Touchstone; a dance studio and a fitness center. The past several years have seen a variety of campus renovations including improvements to the library, dining facilities, gym, athletic fields, tennis courts and campus walkways. In 2012 the institution welcomed Heritage Hall, a permanent exhibition of the institution&#x27;s history.

==Academics==
Manhattanville offers the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, and Bachelor of Fine Arts degrees to undergraduate students and the Master of Arts in Teaching, Master of Education, Master of Professional Studies, Master of Science, and Doctor of Education degrees to graduate students. Undergraduates can choose from 45 majors and minors, while graduate students can explore 75 graduate degrees and advanced certificates. Students are also free to design special majors or engage in dual majors.

===Graduate programs===

In addition to its 45 majors and minors of undergraduate study, Manhattanville University offers 75 graduate master&#x27;s degrees and certificates and an Ed.D. in the School of Education. The university also offers Master&#x27;s of Science degrees, a Master of Fine Arts, and a range of dual degree programs. The Institute for Managing Risk and the Women&#x27;s Leadership Institute provide academic resources skills and events to serve the needs of individuals, organizations and businesses.

===School of Nursing and Health Sciences===
In 2019 the school began exploring the possibility of opening a nursing school as the nearby College of New Rochelle had permanently closed. In fall 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Manhattanville opened its nursing school. During its first year, in 2020, Manhattanville&#x27;s School of Nursing and Health Sciences admitted more than 120 nursing students. In January 2021, the institution added a Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) program that welcomed its first students in the fall 2021. The school offers two degrees in nursing: Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) for traditional 4-year and transfer students as well as a Bachelor of Science in Nursing for second-degree students who hold a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

In 2021, Manhattanville announced that it reached an agreement with Concordia College to acquire the school&#x27;s Radiologic Technology (Rad Tech) program and the Rad Tech students from Concordia transferred to Manhattanville to complete their degrees. The Bachelor of Science (BS) in Radiologic Technology is a 122-credit program accredited by the &quot;Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology&quot; (JRCERT) and registered with the New York State Department of Education (NYSED).

In November 2021, the School of Nursing and Health Sciences received accreditation from the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) for its Bachelor of Science programs in Nursing. In addition, as of November 2021, the school has a 100 percent pass rate for the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX), meaning all recent graduates from the Bachelor of Science in Nursing program at Manhattanville who have taken the test have passed the national licensure exam.

===Manhattanville Library Rare Book and Manuscripts Room===
The Rare Book and Manuscripts Room preserves both manuscripts and printed materials from the Manhattanville University Library. The rare book collection consists of approximately 2,400 titles that span the history of the book in the United States and Europe. Subject fields represented include history, religion, literature, biography, and philosophy. The collection also includes other formats such as periodicals, Jewish pamphlets, government documents, maps, and manuscripts. Particularly noteworthy are five incunabula, and several bound manuscript volumes. The latter include individual collections of psalms and prayers intended as an aid to private devotion, known as the &quot;Books of Hours&quot;. The most notable of these is the &quot;Horae Beatae Mariae Virginis, Cum Calendario&quot;—also known as the &quot;Manhattanville Book of Hours&quot;.

===Pius X School of Liturgical Music===
The Pius X School of Liturgical Music was opened in 1916 and closed in 1960. It was founded by Justine Ward, who had developed teaching methods for Gregorian chant emulating the techniques of the monks in Solesmes, and by Georgia Stevens, a musician and nun. Faculty over the years included Ward, Achille Bragers and André Mocquereau. Thousands of music teachers studied at the school, including Cecilia Clare Bocard and Thomas Mark Liotta. The school&#x27;s namesake was Pope Pius X, a devotee of sacred music who initiated reform of the liturgy in the 20th century. In 1959, Richard Rodgers attended a concert on the college&#x27;s campus as part of research for The Sound of Music. In 2010 a Gregorian Chant, held in Pius X Hall, as part of Inauguration festivities for a previous President, saw a packed auditorium of alumni, students, and faculty, continuing on the tradition of the Pius X School of Liturgical Music.

==Student life==
The institution has four residence halls: Founders Hall, Spellman Hall, and two twin buildings (Dammann Hall and Tenney Hall). Most of Spellman Hall is used for housing first-year students, while the remainder of Spellman Hall, and all of Founders Hall, Dammann Hall, and Tenney Hall are occupied by upper-class students. Founders Hall and Spellman Hall use regular-size rooms, while Dammann Hall and Tenney Hall use suites. All four halls, as well as the library and most main buildings, were designed by the architectural firm Eggers &amp; Higgins.

===Athletics===

Manhattanville is a member of NCAA Division III, competing primarily in the Skyline Conference, the United Collegiate Hockey Conference (men&#x27;s &amp; women&#x27;s hockey), and the NECC (Woman&#x27;s Field Hockey).

<text>Leo Moser (11 April 1921, Vienna – 9 February 1970, Edmonton) was an Austrian-Canadian mathematician, best known for his polygon notation.

A native of Vienna, Leo Moser immigrated with his parents to Canada at the age of three. He received his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Manitoba in 1943, and a Master of Science from the University of Toronto in 1945. After two years of teaching he went to the University of North Carolina to complete a PhD, supervised by Alfred Brauer. There, in 1950, he began suffering recurrent heart problems. He took a position at Texas Technical College for one year, and joined the faculty of the University of Alberta in 1951, where he remained until his death at the age of 48.

In 1966, Moser posed the question &quot;What is the region of smallest area which will accommodate every planar arc of length one?&quot;. Rephrased to consider the planar arc a &quot;worm&quot;, this became known as Moser&#x27;s worm problem and as of 2024 remains an open problem.

<doc id="745181" wikidata="Q6531421" url="?curid=745181" title="Toshio Sakai">
<text>was a Japanese photographer for United Press International. He was the first winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography.

== Biography ==
Toshio Sakai was born in Tōkai, Japan, on March 31, 1940. In 1964 he graduated from the Meiji University and subsequently joined United Press International as a darkroom technician. Within a year, he was promoted to the position of staff photographer. In 1965-1975 he worked for UPI, covering a wide range of topics and traveling to various hotspots around the world. He covered the Vietnam War and made several trips to the country in 1966-68. His close friend was another Japanese photographer and Pulitzer Prize winner Kyōichi Sawada. Tragically, Sawada was killed in Cambodian Takéo Province in October 1970, Sakai was the one who returned Sawada’s ashes to his widow.

In 1973, Sakai switched to the role of news picture editor. After the fall of Saigon in 1975, he became UPI’s photo manager in Seoul. In 1977, he became an independent freelance photographer, contributing to publications such as Newsweek, the Times, and other significant international publications. In 1986 he covered the overthrow of Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines and riots at the Tiananmen Square in 1989.

In 1968, he received the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography for his photo &quot;Dreams of Better Times&quot; taken on June 17, 1967, during the Vietnam War. He was the first person to receive that award. The photo showed an American soldier asleep on a pile of sandbags under a heavy monsoon rain, while his comrade was standing guard. Their troop located at the Landing Zone Rufe in 36 miles northeast Of Phuc Vinh, they had a brief rest after sniper and mortar fire.

UPI selected Toshio Sakai for a trip to Laos, but his appearance was considered too Japanese and good-looking and he couldn’t be disguised as a Vietnamese, that is why the crew chief “always told him to get lost”. In 1968 Sakai became the photo director of the Tokyo bureau of Agence France-Presse, in 1994 he founded a video film planning company.

Sakai died from a heart attack at the age of 59.

<doc id="745184" wikidata="Q219097" url="?curid=745184" title="Fast of Gedalia">
<text>The Fast of Gedalia (; &quot;Tzom Gedalya&quot;), also transliterated from the Hebrew language as Gedaliah or Gedalya(h), is a minor Jewish fast day from dawn until dusk to lament the assassination of Gedaliah, the governor of what was the Kingdom of Judah. His death ended Jewish autonomy following the destruction of the First Temple and the fall of King Zedekiah.
==Biblical narrative==
When Nebuchadnezzar, the king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, conquered Jerusalem, he killed or exiled most of its inhabitants and appointed Gedaliah as governor of the neo-Babylonian province of Yehud.

However, Baalis, king of Ammon, was hostile and envious of the Judean remnant and sent a Judean, Yishmael Ben Netaniah, who was descended from the royal family of Judea, to assassinate Gedaliah. In the seventh month (Tishrei) of 582/1 BCE (some four to five years following the destruction of the Temple, although the exact year is unclear and subject to dispute; others claim the assassination took place in the same year as the destruction), a group of Jews led by Yishmael came to Gedaliah in the town of Mitzpa and were received cordially. Gedaliah had been warned of his guest&#x27;s murderous intent, but refused to believe his informants, believing their report was mere slander. Yishmael murdered Gedaliah, together with most of the Jews who had joined him and many Babylonians whom the Babylonian king had left with Gedaliah. The remaining Jews feared the vengeance of the Babylonian king (since the king&#x27;s chosen ruler, Gedaliah, had been killed by a Jew) and fled to Egypt.

The events are recounted briefly in the Hebrew Bible in 2 Kings 25:25–26:
A fuller account is in Jeremiah chapter 41, where the murder of a group of envoys and the kidnapping of the gubernatorial staff and family are also related:
==In Josephus==
In Flavius Josephus&#x27; &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, the story of the conspiracy is provided in considerable detail.

==Institution of fast==
In remembrance of these tribulations, the Jewish sages instituted the Fast of the Seventh (see Zechariah 8:19) on the day of Gedaliah&#x27;s assassination in the seventh month.

The Hebrew Bible does not specify on which day of the seventh month Gedaliah was killed. However, the Hebrew word &quot;hodesh&quot; can mean &quot;new moon&quot; as well as &quot;month&quot;, suggesting that he was killed on the first of the month. According to the Talmud, Gedaliah was killed on the third of the month. Other sources suggest that Gedaliah was killed on the first of the month, but the fast is delayed until after Rosh Hashanah, since fasting is prohibited during a festival.

According to the Talmud, the aim of the fast day is &quot;to establish that the death of the righteous is likened to the burning of the House of our God.&quot; Just as fasts were ordained to commemorate the destruction of the Jewish Temple, likewise a fast was ordained to commemorate the death of Gedaliah.

Karaite Jews observe this fast day on the 24th of the month since Book of Nehemiah states that the 24th was a fast day.

==Dates==
The fast is observed on the third of Tishrei in the Hebrew calendar. This is the day after the second day of Rosh Hashanah. The Gregorian (civil) date for the Fast of Gedalia varies from year to year.

When Rosh Hashanah falls on Thursday and Friday, the fast is postponed until Sunday (which would be the fourth of Tishrei), since no public fast may be observed on Shabbat (Saturday) with the exception of Yom Kippur. That was most recently the case in 2024.
Dates of the fast in recent years:

*2020: Monday, September 21
*2021: Thursday, September 9
*2022: Wednesday, September 28
*2023: Monday, September 18
*2024: Sunday, October 6

==Observances==

The fast is observed from dawn until dusk. As with all fast days, the hazzan includes the prayer Aneinu in the repetition of the Amidah during Shacharit and Mincha as a separate Bracha between the prayers for redemption and healing, and individuals recite it in the private recitation of the amidah as an addition to Shema Koleinu (general prayer acceptance); in the Ashkenazic tradition it is recited by individuals only Mincha, in the Sephardic tradition in Shacharit and Mincha, and in the Yemenite tradition it is recited even at Maariv the night before the fast. The Avinu Malkeinu prayer is recited and as it is during the Ten Days of Repentance the additions reference the new year. A Torah scroll is taken from the ark and the passages of Ki Tissa are read from the Torah (Exodus 32:11–14 and 34:1–10). The same Torah reading is added at Mincha, followed in Ashkenazic congregations by a Haftarah reading.

As the fast falls during the days of Penitence, the Selichot prayer is recited before the start of Shacharit and incorporates also an extra paragraph relating to the Fast of Gedaliah. In the Ashkenazic rite, there are no Selichot recited at the time of the repetition of the Amidah, but some Sephardic communities do recite additional supplications at this time as well.

In the Spanish and Portuguese rite, the prayers are recited from the Book of Prayers for Fast Days. There are lengthy additions to the prayers that are not found in the daily and Sabbath siddur, and that are specific to the day as well as prayers that are common to all the fast days with the exception of Yom Kippur.

<text>Reser Stadium is an outdoor athletic stadium on the campus of Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon, United States. The home of the Oregon State Beavers of the Pac-12 Conference, it opened in 1953 as Parker Stadium and was renamed in 1999. At 12-13 stories and tall it is the tallest man-made structure in Corvallis and Benton County history and the tallest building between Eugene, Oregon, and the Salem metropolitan area.

Renovations for a new southwest grandstand decreased the seating capacity to 35,548 starting with the 2023 season. The FieldTurf playing field runs northwest to southeast, at an approximate elevation of above sea level, with the press box above the grandstand on the southwest sideline.

==History and use==
From 1910 to 1953, the Beavers played their home games at Bell Field (now the site of the Dixon Recreation Center), and also played as many as four games a year at Multnomah Stadium (now Providence Park) in Portland. In 1948, Oregon State president August L. Strand, athletic director Spec Keene, and Portland businessman Charles T. Parker (1885–1977) met to plan a replacement for Bell Field. Parker, a 1907 alumnus, kicked off the stadium fundraising campaign in 1949 and made significant contributions of his own. In 1952, construction of the stadium began; for Parker&#x27;s efforts and contributions, the stadium was named in his honor. The first game was played on Homecoming, November 14, 1953, and the Beavers defeated Washington State 7–0. At the time, it seated 28,000.
Parker was renovated in 1958, 1965, and 1967, reaching a capacity of approximately 40,500 seats, but the architect&#x27;s full intent never came to fruition. The roof over the main southwest grandstand was approved in 1988, and with the completion of the original Valley Football Center behind the northwest end zone, capacity was reduced to 35,362 in 1990; the roof and new press box were completed in 1991.

The stadium was renamed in June 1999 to honor Al and Pat Reser, owners of Reser&#x27;s Fine Foods. The couple both graduated from Oregon State in 1960, and are major donors to the university and Beavers athletics, though Al died at the age of 74 in 2010. The Parker name is still honored at Parker Plaza, located between Reser and Gill Coliseum, the site of many pregame activities.

The stadium is located on the southwest corner of the Oregon State campus at the intersection of SW 26th Street and SW Western Boulevard in Corvallis. In addition to football, intramural and club sports also use the facility occasionally.

Reser Stadium alternates with Autzen Stadium at the University of Oregon in hosting the annual rivalry game with the Ducks. Since 1954, the games in even-numbered years have been played in Corvallis, odd-numbered in Eugene.

===Playing surface===
Through the 1968 season, the stadium&#x27;s playing surface was natural grass. AstroTurf was installed in 1969, and replaced in 1974 and 1977. The brand was switched to All-Pro artificial turf in 1984, which was in place for 15 seasons, replaced in 1999 with AstroTurf 12/2000. Infilled FieldTurf debuted in 2005, and was replaced prior to the 2012 season.

==Expansion and upgrades==
Through the 2004 season, the official capacity of the stadium stood at 35,362. In 2003 the &quot;Raising Reser&quot; campaign was initiated, which resulted in an increase of seating capacity to 43,300 for the 2005 season by way of constructing a new grandstand along the northeast sideline.
&quot;Phase Two&quot; of the &quot;Raising Reser&quot; project was completed between the 2006 and 2007 football seasons; it enclosed the horseshoe in the southeast end zone with continuous seating in the corners. This addition raised total seating capacity to 45,674 and included the ProStar Digital VideoPlus Display screen.

During the planned Phase Three, the upper level will extend through the southwest grandstand.

The north end zone is also home to the Valley Football Center, which houses a large weight room, offices and meeting facilities, reserved primarily for coaches and administrators within the football program. In December 2014, &quot;Victory Through Valley&quot;, an expansion to the stadium and Valley Football Center was announced as part of $42 million in upgrades. The renovations were scheduled to begin in Fall 2015 and were completed by the beginning of the 2016 football season. &quot;Victory Through Valley&quot; upgrades included a new auditorium, coaches offices, team room, locker room, rehab facilities, and hall of fame. The new additions and upgrades have helped with recruiting, competitiveness, and functionality.

On February 4, 2021, renovations for the outdated 16,956-seat southwest grandstand were revealed to the public. Construction began on December 1, 2021, and will be completed in time for the 2023 football season. Although the renovation ultimately lowered Reser Stadium&#x27;s total capacity to 35,548, the new grandstand is larger in size than its predecessor.

==Notable Features==

===Large Oversized Chainsaw===

There is an oversized chainsaw standing in the Reser’s Terrace section. “For us, the chainsaw is an in-venue piece, that goes down well in front of a home crowd at Reser Stadium,” said Sara Elcano, senior associate athletic director of external operations.

===Retired Numbers===

Heisman Trophy winner Terry Baker&#x27;s number &quot;11&quot; is currently the only retired number hanging on the Valley Football Center overlooking the Reser Terrace section in the north end zone. And, although not a retired number Oregon State has &quot;AL&quot; displayed opposite Terry Baker&#x27;s number &quot;11&quot; for long time donor/philanthropist/contributor Al Reser.

===IronMan Statue===

A large statue in the southwest end zone corner of the stadium was placed in 2003 to commemorate the 1933 &#x27;Iron Men&#x27; Team.

On Oct. 21, 1933, using only 11 players the full 60 minutes, Oregon State College held two-time defending national champion and No. 1-ranked USC to a scoreless tie, thus ending the nation&#x27;s longest winning streak at 25. It is believed this is the only time in NCAA history that a defending national champion and No. 1-ranked school was toppled from the ranks by a team using only 11 men the entire game.

The sculpture was donated by William &quot;Bill&quot; Tomsheck: The last surviving Ironman member and long-time Corvallis, OR resident.

===&quot;Beaver Fans 1&quot; Sculpture===

Visitors to Reser Stadium are welcomed with two very impressive and eye-catching bronze sculptures of real-life fans celebrating the Oregon State Beavers football team as they enter the east sideline entrance. They literally pop out of the brick towers they are mounted to and the scene is of a celebratory nature, with various people of yelling or smiling, men and women, most likely for a Beaver touchdown. &quot;Beaver Fans 1&quot; is the first of two commissioned pieces, this sculpture was constructed in 2006, by artist and Professor of Art, Emeritus Tom Morandi created as part of a competition he applied for and won for Oregon&#x27;s One Percent for Art Program. One percent of the cost of new state buildings in Oregon is required to be used towards the purchase of art.

===Electric Field Sculpture===

Electric Field is a large metal football sculpture that is defined by linear metal and ornamented by lighted Xs and triangles that sits at an angle atop a brushed metal base in the plaza of Reser Stadium. Dennis Oppenheim completed the Sculpture in 2006, and described his piece, Electric Field, by &quot;using the universally beautiful geometry of the football to contain the dynamic of the game by showing many different strategic movements experienced during a game. These field actions are represented by symbols of the players in the form of geometric shapes and lines of light which connect them.&quot;

==Attendance records==

==Non-athletic uses==
Apart from use from the Athletic Department, Reser Stadium is occasionally also used for various non-athletic events, particularly events such as commencement, held every June. This has allowed the stadium to hold notable speakers such as astronaut John Glenn. and former first lady Michelle Obama.

&quot;Dam Jam&quot; an annual end of the year concert celebration put on for students and community members, by students, was held a Reser Stadium in 2018 and 2019, drawing up to approximately 14,000 to 18,000 people with headliners Alison Wonderland and Super Duper Kyle in 2018 and Akon and Jesse McCartney in 2019.

In 2005 following the opening game at the newly renovated Reser Stadium country music duo Montgomery Gentry performed.

<text>Excelsior University is a private online university in Albany, New York. It offers undergraduate and graduate degrees and comprises three schools: the school of undergraduate studies, the school of graduate studies, and the school of nursing. It serves mostly non-traditional, adult working students through distance education programs.

==History==

Excelsior College was founded in 1971 by the New York State Board of Regents as its external degree program, known as The Regents External Degree Program (REX). Its initial development was funded by grants from the Ford Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation. Known as Regents College from 1984 through 2000, it operated as a program of the Board of Regents, which also served as its board of trustees. In April 1998, the Board of Regents granted the school a charter to operate as an independent institution. On January 1, 2001, Regents College became Excelsior College. (&quot;Excelsior&quot; means &quot;ever upwards&quot; in Latin; it is the motto of the State of New York.) Excelsior College changed its name to Excelsior University on August 1, 2022.

==Academics==
===History (Regents College)===
Regents College was from its inception a college that had faculty, majors, academic requirements, and advisors, but no courses. Instead, it provided students a framework for having academic credits earned elsewhere evaluated and assembled into a degree program. Regents College also provided a way to earn credits through its Regents College Examinations. For some subjects Regents College referred students to regionally-accredited colleges which provided instruction, accessible from the student&#x27;s location whenever possible.

Regents College obtained regional accreditation with little difficulty. However students did not qualify for Federal Student Aid, which funded instruction, not advising and evaluation students. Starting with its first graduate program, a Master of Arts in Liberal Studies that began in 1998, Regents College began adding distance learning courses through digital means, such as DVDs.

Since Regents College was designed to consolidate credit from other universities, any transfer credit from an accredited institution was accepted if it fell within one of college&#x27;s degree programs and was earned within an allowable time limit.

===Since 1998===
Known as Excelsior College beginning in 1998, and Excelsior University since 2022, the school is well known for its flexible, online degree programs.

Sources of college credit that can be used towards an Excelsior degree program include Excelsior distance learning courses, courses from other accredited institutions, college-level subject-matter examinations (including CLEP exams, and DSST/DANTES exams), non-collegiate training (including corporate, governmental, and military training) that has been evaluated for college-level credit by the American Council on Education (ACE) and National College Credit Recommendation Service (NCCRS), and assessments of prior learning portfolios.

Excelsior is a member of the Servicemembers Opportunity Colleges (SOC) Consortium of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities.

===Accreditation===
Excelsior University is regionally accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. Its bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s nursing programs are accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing, Inc. (ACEN). The School of Nursing has twice been designated a Center of Excellence in Nursing Education by the National League for Nursing. Its bachelor&#x27;s degree programs in electrical engineering technology, information technology, and nuclear engineering technology are accredited by the Technology Accreditation Commission of ABET, Inc. The bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree programs in business are accredited by the International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education (IACBE).

<text>Herbert Ellis Robbins (January 12, 1915 – February 12, 2001) was an American mathematician and statistician. He did research in topology, measure theory, statistics, and a variety of other fields. 
He was the co-author, with Richard Courant, of &quot;What is Mathematics?&quot;. The Robbins lemma, used in empirical Bayes methods, is named after him. Robbins algebras are named after him because of a conjecture (since proved) that he posed concerning Boolean algebras. The Robbins&#x27; theorem, in graph theory, is also named after him, as is the Whitney–Robbins synthesis, a tool he introduced to prove this theorem. The well-known unsolved problem of minimizing in sequential selection the expected rank of the selected item under full information, sometimes referred to as the fourth secretary problem, also bears his name: Robbins&#x27; problem (of optimal stopping).

==Biography==
Robbins was born in New Castle, Pennsylvania.

As an undergraduate, Robbins attended Harvard University, where Marston Morse influenced him to become interested in mathematics. Robbins received a doctorate from Harvard in 1938 under the supervision of Hassler Whitney and was an instructor at New York University from 1939 to 1941. After World War II, Robbins taught at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1946 to 1952, where he was one of the original members of the department of mathematical statistics, then spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study. In 1953, he became a professor of mathematical statistics at Columbia University. He retired from full-time activity at Columbia in 1985 and was then a professor at Rutgers University until his retirement in 1997. He has 567 descendants listed at the Mathematics Genealogy Project.

In 1955, Robbins introduced empirical Bayes methods at the Third Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability. Robbins was also one of the inventors of the first stochastic approximation algorithm, the Robbins–Monro method, and worked on the theory of power-one tests and optimal stopping. In 1985, in the paper &quot;Asymptotically efficient adaptive allocation rules&quot;, with TL Lai, he constructed uniformly convergent population selection policies for the multi-armed bandit problem that possess the fastest rate of convergence to the population with highest mean, for the case that the population reward distributions are the one-parameter exponential family. These policies were simplified in 
the 1995 paper &quot;Sequential choice from several populations&quot;, with Michael Katehakis.

He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and was past president of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.

<doc id="745202" wikidata="Q7301277" url="?curid=745202" title="Reality tunnel">
<text>Reality tunnel is a theory that, with a subconscious set of mental filters formed from beliefs and experiences, every individual interprets the same world differently, hence &quot;Truth is in the eye of the beholder&quot;. It is similar to the idea of representative realism, and was coined by Timothy Leary (1920–1996). It was further expanded on by Robert Anton Wilson (1932–2007), who wrote about the idea extensively in his 1983 book &quot;Prometheus Rising&quot;.

Wilson and Leary co-wrote a chapter in Leary&#x27;s 1988 book &quot;Neuropolitique&quot; (a revised edition of the 1977 book &quot;Neuropolitics&quot;), in which they explained further: 
The gene-pool politics which monitor power struggles among terrestrial humanity are transcended in this info-world, i.e. seen as static, artificial charades. One is neither coercively manipulated into another&#x27;s territorial reality nor forced to struggle against it with reciprocal game-playing (the usual soap opera dramatics). One simply elects, consciously, whether or not to share the other&#x27;s reality tunnel.

==Considerations==
Every kind of ignorance in the world all results from not realizing that our perceptions are gambles. We believe what we see and then we believe our interpretation of it, we don&#x27;t even know we are making an interpretation most of the time. We think this is reality. – Robert Anton Wilson 

The idea does not necessarily imply that there is no objective truth; rather that our access to it is mediated through our senses, experience, conditioning, prior beliefs, and other non-objective factors. The implied individual world each person occupies is said to be their reality tunnel. The term can also apply to groups of people united by beliefs: we can speak of the fundamentalist Christian reality tunnel or the ontological naturalist reality tunnel.

A parallel can be seen in the psychological concept of confirmation bias—the human tendency to notice and assign significance to observations that confirm existing beliefs, while filtering out or rationalizing away observations that do not fit with prior beliefs and expectations. This helps to explain why reality tunnels are usually transparent to their inhabitants. While it seems most people take their beliefs to correspond to the &quot;one true objective reality&quot;, Robert Anton Wilson emphasizes that each person&#x27;s reality tunnel is their own artistic creation, whether they realize it or not.

Wilson—like John C. Lilly in his 1968 book &quot;Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer&quot;—relates that through various techniques one can break down old reality tunnels and impose new reality tunnels by removing old filters and replacing them with new ones, with new perspectives on reality—at will. This is attempted through various processes of deprogramming using neuro-linguistic programming, cybernetics, hypnosis, biofeedback devices, meditation, controlled use of hallucinogens, and forcibly acting out other reality tunnels. Thus, it is believed one&#x27;s reality tunnel can be widened to take full advantage of human potential and experience reality on more positive levels. Robert Anton Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus Rising&quot; is (among other things) a guidebook to the exploration of various reality tunnels.

In line with Kantian thought, as well as the work of Norwood Russell Hanson, studies have indeed shown that our brains &quot;filter&quot; the data coming from our senses. This &quot;filtering&quot; is largely unconscious and may be influenced—more-or-less in many ways, in societies and in individuals—by biology, cultural constructs including education and language (such as memes), life experiences, preferences and mental state, belief systems (e.g. world view, the stock market), momentary needs, pathology, etc.

An everyday example of such filtering is our ability to follow a conversation, or read, without being distracted by surrounding conversations, once called the cocktail party effect.

In his 1986 book &quot;Waking Up&quot;, Charles Tart—an American psychologist and parapsychologist known for his psychological work on the nature of consciousness—introduced the phrase &quot;consensus trance&quot; to the lexicon. Tart likened normal waking consciousness to hypnotic trance. He discussed how each of us is from birth inducted to the trance of the society around us. Tart noted both similarities and differences between hypnotic trance induction and consensus trance induction. (See G. I. Gurdjieff).

Some disciplines—Zen for example, and monastic schools such as Sufism—seek to overcome such conditioned realities by returning to less thoughtful and channeled states of mind. Similarly, the philosophy of life Pyrrhonism seeks to overcome these conditioned realities by inducing epoche (suspension of judgment) through skeptical arguments.

Constructivism is a modern psychological response to reality-tunneling.
For Wilson, a fully functioning human ought to be aware of their reality tunnel, and be able to keep it flexible enough to accommodate, and to some degree empathize with, different reality tunnels, different &quot;game rules&quot;, different cultures ... Constructivist thinking is the exercise of metacognition to become aware of our reality tunnels or labyrinths and the elements that &quot;program&quot; them. Constructivist thinking should, ideally, decrease the chance that we will confuse our map of the world with the actual world ... [This philosophy] is currently expressed in many Eastern consciousness-exploration techniques.

<text>Prienai () is a city in Lithuania situated on the Nemunas River, south of Kaunas. In 2023 the city had 8,894 inhabitants. The name of the city is a derivative from a surname &quot;Prienas&quot;. Pociūnai Airport is associated with the city.

==History==

===Early history===
The history of Prienai and its surroundings is closely linked to that of the Baltic region. Traces of sporadic human settlement go back to the Neolithic period. However, the vast majority of archeological findings such as tools and antiquity coins date to the Iron Age, when the region of Prienai was inhabited by early Baltic tribes. Lush forests, strategically useful valleys, and stunningly beautiful banks of the Nemunas River were among the main reasons why the area became dotted with 28 hillforts, many of which were relatively densely populated thousands of years ago.

===Grand Duchy of Lithuania===

The first documented mention of Prienai is in 1502 when the Grand Duke of Lithuania Alexander gave the land of Prienai to the noble Mykolas Glinskis, who, following his exile from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, became the tutor of his nephew Ivan the Terrible. In 1609, the city was granted the Magdeburg rights, though they were greatly expanded in 1791 by the Grand Duke of Lithuania Stanislaw II Augustus. The city&#x27;s arms showing St. George killing the dragon was granted in the same year. St. George was one of the patron saints of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

In 1579, Prienai was given by Grand Duke of Lithuania Stephen Báthory to the Hungarian nobleman Gabriel Bekes, brother of the more famed Gáspár Bekes, for his loyal participation in the Livonian War. The Bekes family ruled Prienai for the next two decades. Afterwards, it became the property of another Hungarian nobleman, named Kaspar Horvat. In 1616, the Lithuanian nobleman and politician Stefan Pac, who would later become the Deputy Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, acquired Prienai. He and his sons Stanislovas and Mikołaj Stefan Pac owned it up until 1643.

For almost one and a half centuries, Prienai was ruled by the Butler family. In 1661, Count Gothard Wilhelm Butler, a Lithuanian nobleman of distant Scottish descent, built the Prienai castle. However, in 1701, during the Great Northern War, the castle together with its amenities was completely destroyed. In the early 18th century, the city somewhat recovered from the devastation of the Great Northern War and in the place of the former castle, the Butler family had built a spacious two-storeyed Baroque styled manor house. On the ground floor there was a large guest-hall and 16 rooms. On the first floor there were 11 additional rooms and a sizable great hall. Yet over the course of the next century, the Prienai manor house was gradually abandoned. At the onset of the 20th century, only rubble remained. The 3rd Lithuanian Infantry Regiment was stationed in the town in 1792.

The first wooden church in Prienai was built in 1604. Thanks to the active personal involvement of a priest named Vaitiekus Izdebskis, seventy years later, later a newer and much larger church was built to replace the old one. The present Baroque styled church was built in 1750, though it was refurbished and slightly expanded in 1875.

===Prussia, Napoleon and the Russian Empire===
Following the third partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Prienai was invaded and occupied by Prussia. Prussia ruled there during the years 1795-1807 and made Prienai part of New East Prussia. At the end of the eighteenth century, Prienai underwent rapid economic growth. During that time a glass factory and a paper mill, one of the largest in Lithuania, were established near the town. The paper mill produced extraordinary high quality white, coloured and wrapping paper, which was often exported to cities as distant as Warsaw and Saint Petersburg.

After Napoleon defeated Prussia, in 1807, Prussian-occupied Lithuanian territories were transferred to the newly established Polish Duchy of Warsaw. The Napoleonic code was then introduced in this region, which abolished serfdom and guaranteed equality before the law.

Following the demise of Napoleon in 1815 and the Congress of Vienna, Prienai together with its surroundings, were annexed by the Russian Empire.

The town dwellers of Prienai, together with the inhabitants of neighbouring towns and villages, actively participated in the November Uprising of 1830-1831 and the January Uprising of 1863–1864, both of which sought to liberate Lithuanians from the Russian yoke.

===Republic of Lithuania===
Following Lithuania&#x27;s restoration of independence in 1918, Prienai became the center of the county and witnessed unprecedented expansion. By 1937 Prienai had a population of around 4,200, there were 4 banks, 2 pharmacies, 121 shops, 5 mills, a number of sawmills and countless workshops in the city. At that time the mayor of the city was Julius Greimas, the father of the world renowned Lithuanian-French literary scientist and semiotician Algirdas Julien Greimas. Yet despite the flurry of diverse economic activity, brewing was indisputably the most significant industry in Prienai. The Goldberg beer brewery was established back in 1868 and during the interwar period its facilities dominated the urban landscape of the city. According to local contemporaries, the brewery produced one of the finest beers in Lithuania and its products were regularly exported to Latvia, Poland and the Soviet Union. However, the brewery together with most of its buildings was completely destroyed by the German Luftwaffe during a bombing raid in June 1941.

===World War II and its aftermath===
During World War II, when it was occupied by German troops, Prienai lost many of its inhabitants. People emigrated or were expelled, while the Nazis killed the Jews. On August 27, 1941, 1,078 Jews from Prienai and surrounding areas were murdered in Prienai. The massacre was perpetrated by Rollkommando Hamann and local collaborators.

In the aftermath of World War II, Prienai was occupied by Soviet Union and its population suffered additional losses. Throughout 1945–1946, the Soviets murdered 39 inhabitants from Prienai and its surroundings. On 22–23 May 1948, 1,019 Lithuanians from the Prienai area were forced by the Soviets into cattle trains and deported to Siberia. In 1949, 675 more local people were deported to Siberia. Most of the deportees either died there or suffered circumstances that never allowed them to return home.

<text>Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology (commonly called Vaughn College) is a private college in East Elmhurst, New York, specialized in aviation and engineering education. It is adjacent to LaGuardia Airport but was founded in Newark, New Jersey, in 1932 before moving to New York City in 1940. The college&#x27;s most recent name change, to honor a founder, was on September 1, 2004.

== History ==
In 1929, Charles S. “Casey” Jones, a pioneer aviator and aviation company executive, foresaw the need for highly trained technicians to design, build and service aircraft and engines. George A. Vaughn Jr. and Lee D. Warrender joined with Charles S. &quot;Casey&quot; Jones in founding the Casey Jones School of Aeronautics, the predecessor of the Academy of Aeronautics, and after September 1986, the College of Aeronautics. Effective September 1, 2004, the Board of Regents of the State of New York approved the institution changing its name from the College of Aeronautics to Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology.

=== Founding ===
Mayor Fiorello Henry La Guardia laid the cornerstone of the academy building in 1940, shortly after the opening of LaGuardia Airport. Mayor LaGuardia wanted an aviation school to teach and train young people in the aviation technologies at his new airport. At the time, his friend and flying comrade of World War I, Charles (“Casey”) S. Jones, was operating the Casey Jones School of Aeronautics near Newark Airport. In early 1940, the mayor convinced Casey to establish a school near LaGuardia airport, across the Grand Central Parkway. It was founded by Jones, a well-known racing pilot of the 1920s; George Augustus Vaughn, Jr., second-ranking ace of World War I; and Lee D. Warrender, an aeronautical engineer. The Casey Jones School educated and trained 20,000 men and women who supported the nation&#x27;s successful air effort during World War II.

Following World War II, the Casey Jones school was consolidated with the Academy of Aeronautics, and returned to the civilian aviation industry. In the fall of 1964, the Academy of Aeronautics conferred associate in applied science degrees for the first time, and, in 1969, the academy was accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. In 1996, the college completely revised its curriculum offering, resulting in nine new academic programs, including for the first time, the Bachelor of Science and an associate degree in flight. On May 5, 1998, a 35,000-square-foot addition to the building complex was completed.

=== Expansion ===

In the fall of 1964, the Academy of Aeronautics conferred associate in applied science degrees for the first time. In 1969, the academy was accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. In 1996, the college completely revised its curriculum offering, resulting in nine new academic programs, including for the first time, the Bachelor of Science and an associate degree in flight. On May 5, 1998, a state-of-the-art addition to the building complex was completed. It includes a observation tower providing views of the runways at LaGuardia airport.

In 2010 a mural depicting early aviation that had been painted by Aline Rhonie Hofheimer in hangar F at Roosevelt Field was transferred to Vaughn and will be displayed following renovations.

== Academics ==
Vaughn College has an enrollment of approximately 1200 students as of 2023. It provides associate degree, bachelor&#x27;s degrees, and master&#x27;s degrees in engineering, technology, aviation, and management. The Aviation Training Institute at Vaughn offers the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Airframe and Powerplant maintenance certificate. Vaughn is the only college in New York to offer the engineering program Mechatronics. Developed at MIT, Mechatronics is a combination of several engineering types including Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering.

The institution is also designated by the FAA as a Collegiate Training Institute and offers a non-degree air traffic control program for those wishing to pursue a career in this field. The associate in Applied Science (AAS) in Avionics, the associate in applied science (AAS) degree in Aeronautical Engineering Technology, and the Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Electronic Engineering Technology, as well as the Bachelor of Science (B.S) degree in Mechanical Engineering Technology are accredited by the Technology Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). Vaughn College has strong relations with aerospace industries like Northrop Grumman, NASA and Lockheed Martin.

Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology has also received specialized accreditation for its business programs through the International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education (IACBE). The programs accredited by the IACBE are the Associate of Applied Science in Airport Management and the Bachelor of Science in Airport Management, Airline Management and General Management.

Prior to obtaining a four-year degree at Vaughn College in some degree programs, one has to complete an internship performing the role for which the student has studied. Many students land their first post-graduate job in this manner. Vaughn has close ties to many airports and airlines due in part to its close proximity to the local airports such as John F. Kennedy International Airport and LGA in Queens, Westchester and Farmingdale in New York, Teterboro and Newark, New Jersey, and several nearby airports in Connecticut.

===Library===
The library is housed in the main campus. The library has management, flight training and engineering materials, as well as flight simulators. Vaughn began work on the new library in the spring of 2012. As of December 2012, the construction was unfinished. Numerous, minor fires have caused serious setbacks to the original renovation schedule.

Several classes are held in the Residence Hall&#x27;s lounges due to this construction.

=== Management ===
The management programs at Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology includes general management, airline management and airport management. Graduates of these programs are able to secure entry-level to mid-level management positions in small or large corporations and in airports. The field of airport management is a unique discipline with its roots in general business, but driven by the high-tech world of aviation and transportation. Students of the airport management degree program concentrate on subjects as diverse as wildlife hazards, eco-system management, airfield safety, and emergency planning and control. The Bachelor of Science airport management degree was developed to provide students proficiency in all areas of airport operations. The location of the college, adjacent to LaGuardia Airport, provides a learning environment with regard to activities, resources and personnel. Students are given the ability to investigate first-hand the areas of airport management, control of ground vehicles, communication systems, airport security, fire and rescue service, terminal planning and management, and airport maintenance.

=== Engineering and technology ===
Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology offers bachelor and associate degree programs in the field of technology including electronic engineering technology with an Avionics concentration and electronic technology with a concentration in general electronics. The mechanical engineering technology program offers concentrations in computer-aided design and aeronautical options, as well as the associate in applied science degrees in computerized design and animated graphics. A Bachelor of Science (B.S.) is also offered in Mechatronics Engineering. This program has received accreditation by ABET.

=== Aviation ===
Vaughn College has designed degree programs for aviation school students interested in becoming professional pilots and other entry-level operations careers in the aviation industry, as well as related government agencies. All aircraft operations (flight) degree programs offered by Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology include the academic liberal arts and sciences, as well as specific courses in flight that also count as the &quot;ground school&quot; portion of flight instruction. In order to complete Vaughn College&#x27;s degree programs, students must complete all degree requirements, as well as pass the Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s (FAA) written pilot exams. Students may also choose to complete an AAS or BS degree in aircraft operations without completing the flight portion. These students are also eligible to participate in the FAA&#x27;s Air Traffic Control Collegiate Training Initiative. Students have the option of pursuing careers with aviation-related government agencies such as the FAA or the National Transportation Safety Board. FAA ground qualifications also assist students in a variety of aviation careers, including ground instructor, flight dispatcher, accident investigator, aviation administrator and aviation researcher.

=== ROTC ===
Students may participate in the Air Force ROTC program headquartered at Manhattan College. Students may participate in the U.S. Army ROTC program through NYC Army ROTC, headquartered at Fordham University.

=== Civil Air Patrol Unit ===
Academy Cadet Squadron, a subordinate unit of the New York City Group of the Civil Air Patrol, meets every Friday at the college. Members of the cadet program often apply to the college after high school graduation and remain cadets until 21 years of age.

Cadet membership is available for anyone aged 12 to 18 with the opportunity to remain a cadet until 21 once they have joined. Adult members, called &quot;officers&quot; or formerly &quot;Senior Members&quot;, are anywhere from 19 to 21 years of age and serve as staff members in the squadron. Cadets are offered free orientation flight and leadership opportunities. Cadet officers, Cadet Second Lieutenants or higher, are eligible to receive college scholarships on behalf of the Civil Air Patrol&#x27;s sponsors in the private and public sectors.

===Rankings and recognition===
Vaughn was recognized as having the highest upward mobility rate among 2,137 colleges in a January 18, 2017 article published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Vaughn College was noted as &quot;an institution doing more to impact social mobility for those who start from less fortunate means&quot; and listed as the top institution for moving students from the bottom 40 percent to the top 40 percent in income. The article stems from a study conducted by The Equality of Opportunity Project titled &quot;Mobility Report Cards: The Role of Colleges in Intergenerational Mobility.&quot;

The college was ranked among the best Baccalaureate colleges in the 2017 edition of the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; college rankings. Vaughn was also ranked the most racially diverse and the most economically diverse in the North. Vaughn was relisted in the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranking for 2010.

The Air Traffic-Collegiate Training Initiative (AT-CTI) program is a partnership between the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology to provide the academic preparation necessary for students interested in air traffic control careers. Vaughn&#x27;s air traffic control college is one of 36 aviation colleges in the country selected by the FAA to participate in this program that allows the air traffic control college to recommend its graduates to the FAA for hire as air traffic controllers.

<text>John H. Tietjen (June 18, 1928 – February 15, 2004) was a Lutheran clergyman, theologian, and national church leader in the United States. He is best known both for his role in the Seminex controversy which roiled the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) in the mid-1970s, and for his efforts on behalf of Lutheran unity that resulted in the formation of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA).

==Life and work==
Tietjen was born in New York City as a son of German immigrants, and he attended Stuyvesant High School, Concordia Collegiate Institute (now Concordia College, Bronxville), and Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri. He also earned master&#x27;s and doctorate degrees at Union Theological Seminary in New York. After being ordained in the LCMS in 1953, Tietjen rose through the Synod ranks and eventually was chosen as president of its largest seminary, Concordia Seminary, in 1969.

While president of Concordia Seminary, Tietjen and many of the Concordia faculty members faced opposition from a new, more conservative administration of the LCMS. The faculty&#x27;s use of Historical-Critical Method for biblical interpretation was cast by conservatives as being at odds with the historic theological position of the LCMS. Tietjen was accused of allowing the teaching of false doctrine, and he was suspended from his duties as seminary president in January 1974.

As a result, Tietjen and the majority of the seminary faculty formed a rival seminary which they dubbed Concordia Seminary in Exile, or Seminex. Seminex existed in St. Louis until August 1983, and on the campus of the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago (LSTC) until December 1987. Meanwhile, Tietjen and many of his supporters left the LCMS to form the more liberal Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches (AELC). During the early 1980s, Tietjen and the AELC organized unity talks among several other Lutheran church bodies, eventually leading to the formation of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), which today is the largest Lutheran church body in the United States.

==Personal life==
In 1953, John Tietjen married Ernestine Catherine Dammitts (1925-2015) and had four children, Catherine, Laurence, Mary, and Sarah. He also has seven grandchildren Jessica, Jennifer, Carrie, Rachel, Joseph, Elizabeth, and Chase.

John Tietjen battled lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, blood clots, and finally a brain tumor. He died in the comfort of his own home. During the last few months before his death he was working on a final book titled &quot;The Gospel According to Jesus&quot;. The original transcripts were typed, edited by his peers, and published by a private individual to create his new book.

<text>Elateridae or click beetles (or &quot;typical click beetles&quot; to distinguish them from the related families Cerophytidae and Eucnemidae, which are also capable of clicking) are a family of beetles. Other names include elaters, snapping beetles, spring beetles or skipjacks. This family was defined by William Elford Leach (1790–1836) in 1815. They are a cosmopolitan beetle family characterized by the unusual click mechanism they possess. There are a few other families of Elateroidea in which a few members have the same mechanism, but most elaterid subfamilies can click. A spine on the prosternum can be snapped into a corresponding notch on the mesosternum, producing a violent &quot;click&quot; that can bounce the beetle into the air. Clicking is mainly used to avoid predation, although it is also useful when the beetle is on its back and needs to right itself. There are about 9300 known species worldwide, and 965 valid species in North America.

==Etymology==
Leach took the family name from the genus &quot;Elater&quot;, coined by Linnaeus in 1758. In Greek, ἐλατήρ means one who drives, pushes, or beats out. It is also the origin of the word &quot;elastic&quot;, from the notion of beating out a ductile substance.

==Description and ecology==
Some click beetles are large and colorful, but most are under two centimeters long and brown or black, without markings. The adults are typically nocturnal and phytophagous, but only some are of economic importance. On hot nights they may enter houses, but are not pests there. Click beetle larvae, called wireworms, are usually saprophagous, living on dead organisms, but some species are serious agricultural pests, and others are active predators of other insect larvae. Some elaterid species are bioluminescent in both larval and adult form, such as those of the genus &quot;Pyrophorus&quot;.

Larvae are elongate, cylindrical or somewhat flattened, with hard bodies, somewhat resembling mealworms. The three pairs of legs on the thoracic segments are short and the last abdominal segment is, as is frequently the case in beetle larvae, directed downward and may serve as a terminal proleg in some species. The ninth segment, the rearmost, is pointed in larvae of &quot;Agriotes&quot;, &quot;Dalopius&quot; and &quot;Melanotus&quot;, but is bifid due to a so-called caudal notch in &quot;Selatosomus&quot; (formerly &quot;Ctenicera&quot;), &quot;Limonius&quot;, &quot;Hypnoides&quot; and &quot;Athous&quot; species. The dorsum of the ninth abdominal segment may also have sharp processes, such as in the Oestodini, including the genera &quot;Drapetes&quot; and &quot;Oestodes&quot;. Although some species complete their development in one year (e.g. &quot;Conoderus&quot;), most wireworms spend three or four years in the soil, feeding on decaying vegetation and the roots of plants, and often causing damage to agricultural crops such as potato, strawberry, maize, and wheat. The subterranean habits of wireworms, their ability to quickly locate food by following carbon dioxide gradients produced by plant material in the soil, and their remarkable ability to recover from illness induced by insecticide exposure (sometimes after many months), make it hard to exterminate them once they have begun to attack a crop. Wireworms can pass easily through the soil on account of their shape and their propensity for following pre-existing burrows, and can travel from plant to plant, thus injuring the roots of multiple plants within a short time. Methods for pest control include crop rotation and clearing the land of insects before sowing.

Other subterranean creatures such as the leatherjacket grub of crane flies which have no legs, and geophilid centipedes, which may have over two hundred, are sometimes confused with the six-legged wireworms.

== Evolution and taxonomy ==
The oldest known species date to the Triassic, but most are problematic due to only being known from isolated elytra. Many fossil elaterids belong to the extinct subfamily Protagrypninae.

Approximately 20 subfamilies are included in the Elateridae, considered typical of beetles in the superfamily Elateroidea; authorities have moved genera from related families (&quot;e.g.&quot; &quot;false click beetles&quot; to the Thylacosterninae).

<text>Rocket Arena is a multi-purpose arena in Cleveland, Ohio. The building is the home of the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League (AHL). It also serves as a secondary arena for Cleveland State Vikings men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball.

Rocket Arena opened in October 1994 as part of the Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex with adjacent Progressive Field, which opened in April of that year. The facility replaced Richfield Coliseum as the primary entertainment facility for the region and the home of the Cavaliers, and supplanted the Wolstein Center at Cleveland State University, which opened in 1991, as the primary concert and athletic venue in downtown Cleveland. From its opening in October 1994 until August 2005, it was known as Gund Arena, named for former Cavaliers owner Gordon Gund, after he paid for the naming rights. After purchasing a majority of the Cavaliers in March 2005, Dan Gilbert bought the naming rights in August 2005 and renamed the building Quicken Loans Arena after his mortgage lending company Quicken Loans. It was renamed to Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in April 2019 when Quicken Loans rebranded to Rocket Mortgage, as part of the facility&#x27;s renovation and expansion. It was renamed to its current name in 2025 when Rocket Mortgage rebranded to Rocket.

Rocket Arena seats 19,432 people in its basketball configuration and up to 18,926 for ice hockey. It is a frequent site for concerts and other athletic events, such as the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball tournaments of the Mid-American Conference (MAC), hosting since 2000 and 2001, respectively. It has also been the host venue for two NCAA Division I Women&#x27;s Final Fours, in 2007 and 2024; opening and regional semifinal games in the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament; two U.S. Figure Skating Championships, in 2000 and 2009; and the 2016 Republican National Convention.

==History==

Rocket Arena was preceded in downtown Cleveland by the Cleveland Arena, a facility built in 1937 with a seating capacity for basketball of approximately 12,000. It was best known as the site of the Moondog Coronation Ball in 1952, widely regarded as the first rock and roll concert. Cleveland Arena was the first home of the Cavaliers in 1970.

The Cleveland Arena was also the home of an earlier professional basketball team, the Cleveland Rebels of the Basketball Association of America, the original Cleveland Barons ice hockey team, and hosted several games of the Cincinnati Royals of the NBA in the 1960s. By 1970, however, Cleveland Arena was outdated and in disrepair. The Cavs played there their first four seasons. It was replaced in 1974 by the 20,273-seat Richfield Coliseum, located in Richfield, between Cleveland and Akron.

During the 1980s, the site of the Central Market, a fruit and vegetable market that dated back to 1856, was selected for construction of a multi-purpose domed stadium for the Cleveland Browns and Cleveland Indians, but the ballot measure to fund it was defeated by voters. The market site was acquired in 1985 and cleared in 1987 in a continued push for new downtown sports facilities by city and business leaders. In 1990, voters approved a sin tax on alcohol and tobacco products in Cuyahoga County to fund the Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex, which includes the arena and adjacent Progressive Field. Construction began in 1992 with the ballpark opening in April 1994 and the arena in October 1994. The arena opened with a concert by Billy Joel on October 17, 1994. The Cavaliers played their first regular-season game in the arena a few weeks later, a loss to the Houston Rockets on November 8, 1994.

As part of his purchase of the team and the arena naming rights in 2005, Dan Gilbert, owner of Quicken Loans, funded renovations of the arena, which included installing new wine-colored seats, state-of-the-art scoreboards, video systems, and sound systems, new arena graphics and signage, and upgrades to security, locker rooms, and the suites, all of which were in place for the start of the Cavaliers&#x27; 2005–2006 season, except for the seats, which were replaced a few sections at a time.

Gilbert purchased the then-inactive Utah Grizzlies franchise of the American Hockey League on May 16, 2006, and announced that it would move to Quicken Loans Arena to replace the departed Cleveland Barons. The team name was announced as the Lake Erie Monsters on January 25, 2007, and began play in the 2007–08 season. The Lake Erie Monsters changed their name to the Cleveland Monsters on August 9, 2016.

The Las Vegas Gladiators of the Arena Football League announced on October 16, 2007, that they would move to Quicken Loans Arena, becoming the Cleveland Gladiators.

===Improvements===
In December 2016, the Cavaliers announced plans for renovations to the arena that included an increase in the square footage of the concourses and open areas, along with upgrades throughout the building. The plan, which relied partly on tax money for funding, faced opposition from activist groups including the Cuyahoga County Progressive Caucus and the Greater Cleveland Congregations (GCC). After the groups submitted signatures to force a referendum on the plan, the Cavaliers announced that they were withdrawing from the plan, citing rising costs and delays caused by the prospective referendum. However, in August 2017, after Cuyahoga County made a non-binding commitment to build two mental health crisis centers, the GCC withdrew its petitions. In December 2017, the team stated it was moving forward with the renovations. The project was finished in September 2019 by The Whiting-Turner Contracting Company, with the final cost being approximately $185 million.

===Design and operations===
The arena seats 19,432 for basketball, with 2,000 club seats and 88 luxury suites. Seating is divided into three levels, with two main levels of suites and five &quot;platinum suites&quot; on the event level. Around the seating there are two main concourses, one on the ground level to access the 100 level seating and 32 lower suites, and an upper concourse for the top 200 level seating. The lower concourse also includes the ticket office and the two-level main team shop. In between is the club level, which provides access to the 60 upper suites and club seating. Also on the club level is an auxiliary gym, which was used by the Cavaliers as their main practice court until the opening of the Cleveland Clinic Courts practice facility in 2007.

In the hockey and arena football configuration, capacity is 18,926. During most Monsters games, the upper-level seating is closed and covered by a large curtain, reducing capacity to 9,447. In the basketball configuration, when the upper-level seating is closed, capacity is listed at 11,751. 60% of the seating is located in the lower two levels. The seating capacity was reduced in 2018 as part of a major renovation project that expanded the concourses, removed three sections of seating in the upper level, and updated other parts of the facility. From the opening of the arena until 2018, seating capacity for basketball was listed at 20,562, with a maximum for ice hockey and arena football at 20,056.
The main scoreboard at Rocket Arena, nicknamed &quot;Humongotron&quot;, is the fourth largest scoreboard used in an NBA arena. It was installed in October 2014.

On the roof of the building is a large LED message board that measures by . The sign was approved by the Cleveland City Planning Commission in March 2016 with the stipulation that only the arena&#x27;s name or its naming rights sponsor can be shown. Any other use of the sign needs commission approval.

The arena, along with neighboring Progressive Field and an adjacent parking garage, is owned by the Gateway Economic Development Corporation of Greater Cleveland, an entity made up of members appointed by the governments of the city of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County. Gateway leases the arena to the Cavaliers, who also manage the Cleveland Monsters.
In March 2017, in partnership with the non-profit organization KultureCity, the Cavaliers officially introduced the availability of accommodations during all events for guests with hypersensitivity needs, such as attendees with autism spectrum disorders. This includes staff training, free &quot;sensory bags&quot; with headphones, a blanket, and other items geared towards attendees with sensory needs, as well as a sensory room and exemptions from re-entry policies if they are overwhelmed by the environment. The arena became the first in the NBA to be certified by KultureCity as being &quot;sensory inclusive&quot;.

==Tenants==

===Current===

As the home of the Cavaliers and Monsters, Rocket Arena has hosted a number of notable events for each team, including playoff and championship games. Through the 2020–2021 season, the Cavs have hosted playoff games in 12 of their 27 seasons at Rocket Arena, including games three and four of the 2007 NBA Finals, 2017 Finals, 2018 Finals and games three, four, and six of the 2015 and 2016 Finals. The arena was also the site of the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, which celebrated the 50th anniversary of the founding of the NBA, and it also hosted the 2022 All-Star Game, honoring the league&#x27;s 75th anniversary.

The Monsters made their playoff debut in 2011 and returned to the playoffs in 2016. In the 2016 Calder Cup playoffs, the team advanced to the Calder Cup final and swept the Hershey Bears in four games for their first Calder Cup in franchise history. Games three and four were held at Rocket Arena. Game four, held on June 11, was a sell-out and drew 19,665 fans, which set a record for largest crowd to ever see a professional hockey game in the state of Ohio and the second-largest postseason crowd in American Hockey League history.

===Former===
Rocket Arena has been home to other franchises that have either relocated or folded. When it opened in 1994, in addition to being home of the Cavaliers, it was also the home arena for the Cleveland Lumberjacks of the International Hockey League (IHL). The Lumberjacks played at the arena until 2001, when the team folded along with the IHL. Later that year, a new incarnation of the Cleveland Barons, who played in the American Hockey League, began play and were tenants at the arena until 2006 when the team moved to Worcester, Massachusetts.

The Cleveland Gladiators of the Arena Football League qualified for the playoffs in six of their nine seasons in Cleveland and hosted playoff games in 2008, 2011, and 2014. During the 2014 season, the team finished 15–1 overall and advanced to ArenaBowl XXVII, which was held at Rocket Arena. The game drew 18,410 fans and was held at the same time as a Cleveland Browns home preseason game at FirstEnergy Stadium, and a Cleveland Indians home game at adjacent Progressive Field.

Two women&#x27;s professional teams have also called the arena home. From 1997 to 2003, the Cleveland Rockers, one of the eight charter members of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA), played at Rocket Arena. The team folded after the 2003 WNBA season because the Gund&#x27;s, who still owned the Cavs at that point, no longer wished to operate the Rockers franchise, and a new ownership group could not be obtained. The Cleveland Crush of the Lingerie Football League played at Rocket Arena for their 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons before moving to Toledo, Ohio, in late 2013.

==Events==

===College sports===
In addition to its professional sports tenants, Rocket Arena has hosted several intercollegiate sporting events. It has been home to the Mid-American Conference (MAC) men&#x27;s basketball tournament since 2000 and the MAC MAC women&#x27;s basketball tournament since 2001. &quot;MAC Madness,&quot; as it is known, has become a strong draw for the arena. The men&#x27;s semi-final and championship games routinely draw 10,000–15,000 attendees. In addition, the Rocket Arena has served as a host for games of the NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship, hosting early-round games in 2011 and regional semi-final and final games in 2015. Rocket Arena has also hosted games for the NCAA Women&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship, hosting regional semi-finals and finals for the 2006 tournament and the Final Four and national championship games in the 2007 tournament and the 2024 tournament. 

In 2015, it was announced that arena management and Cleveland State University came to an agreement where select Cleveland State Vikings men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball games would take place at Rocket Arena, while the arena would essentially take over operations of the Wolstein Center, CSU&#x27;s primary home arena, being in charge of promoting and booking events at the venue.

===WWE===
The arena has hosted numerous WWE professional wrestling cards, including pay–per–view events such as:

*SummerSlam (1996) – headlined by Shawn Michaels vs. Vader for the WWF Championship
*No Mercy (1999) – headlined by Triple H vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin for the WWF Championship
*Invasion (2001) – headlined by Team Alliance vs. Team WWF
*Survivor Series (2004) – headlined by Team Orton vs. Team Triple H
*Unforgiven (2008) – headlined by the World Heavyweight Championship Scramble match
* – headlined by Bray Wyatt vs. Dean Ambrose in a TLC match
*Fastlane (2016) – headlined by Brock Lesnar vs. Roman Reigns vs. Dean Ambrose in a Triple Threat match for the No. 1 contender for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 32
*Fastlane (2019) – headlined by The Shield vs. Baron Corbin, Drew McIntyre and Bobby Lashley

===Boxing===
On August 29, 2021, Cleveland native and internet personality turned professional boxer Jake Paul took on former UFC Welterweight Champion Tyron Woodley in an 8-round professional boxing match. Paul won the eight round bout via split decision in front of a nearly sold-out Rocket Arena.

===Other events===
Rocket Arena was selected in July 2014 as the host site for the 2016 Republican National Convention. The arena hosted the first Republican presidential debate of the 2016 election, aired by Fox News Channel, on August 6, 2015. The convention was held July 18–21, 2016. Records obtained by the Center for Public Integrity show that Comcast, Microsoft, the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron, Koch Companies Public Sector, PhRMA, and other trade and lobby groups, &quot;funded a limited liability company called &#x27;Friends of the House 2016 LLC&#x27; to pay for &quot;the design and outfitting of an exclusive office, lounge and gathering space, called the &#x27;cloakroom&#x27;, for Republican lawmakers&quot; on the Cleveland Cavaliers practice court Quicken Loans Arena. The Cleveland 2016 Host Committee, who &quot;facilitated construction of the &#x27;cloakroom&quot; space&#x27;, received $923,100 from the Friends of the House 2016 LLC.&quot;

At the request of the Presidium, the Austrian Sports Assembly may appoint natural persons who have acquired special merits for all-Austrian sports and in particular for the BSO as &quot;honorary members&quot;. The honorary membership can also be combined with an honorary function.

==Structure==

Matters of sport fall into the constitutional competence of the federal states. The Confederation primarily carries out a funding competence based on Article 17 of the Federal Constitutional Law (&quot;Private Business Administration&quot;). The federal government&#x27;s Sports Promotion Act forms the basis of federal sports funding.

===State area===

In the state sector, the Federal Ministry of Defense and Sport and the Federal Ministry of Education and the Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy are responsible for the various tasks of the sport at federal level. In addition, individual sports-specific subject areas can also fall into the area of competence of other federal ministries (such as Youth &amp; Sport, Violence prevention at major sporting events, etc.).

Since, according to Article 15 B-VG, agendas of sport fall within the constitutional sphere of action of the federal states, nine regional sports directorates are also established.

===Non-governmental area===

The Austrian Federal Sports Organization is the non-governmental umbrella organization of the Austrian sport and coordinates matters of sport with the responsible state agencies. The regular members of the BSO are the three umbrella organizations ASKÖ, ASVÖ and Sportunion, which currently has 60 recognized trade associations as well as the Austrian Disabled Sports Association, the Austrian Olympic Committee, the Austrian Paralympic Committee and the Special Olympics. Extraordinary members are the provinces, as far as they declare their membership as well as all-Austrian associations of special importance (e.g. Österr. Betriebsssportverband, Österr. Heeressportverband, etc.). The full members have the right to vote in the individual committees of the BSO, such as the Austrian Sports Assembly, the Austrian Sports Council and the Austrian Sports Council.

==Focus==
===Service and advice===
The BSO offers its members a wide range of services. In addition to support in terms of subsidy billing, the BSO office advises its members in a variety of topics. The personal consulting activities of the BSO office are complemented by regular training courses offered by external experts.

===Further education===
With a broad and above all high-quality training in the areas of sports club management and coaching, the Austrian Federal Sports Organization in cooperation with the Ministry of Sport and the Federal Sports Academy strives for high standards and accents in the world of Austrian sports. The athletic excellence and success of the local athletes are seen as a result of professional work and the commitment of the officials in the clubs and associations as well as well-trained coaches. The continuing education and training offers of the BSO should give all functionaries, co-workers or trainers working in Austrian sports the opportunity to develop themselves further and to be even more professional.

===Sport in the EU and International===
Giving sport a voice not only nationally but also internationally is a goal that has been pursued by the BSO for many years. The partnership with the EU Office of the European Olympic Committees ensures an exchange of information and a strong representation of sport among decision-makers and institutions in Brussels.

===Social and society===

A central topic of the work and the tasks of the BSO is the aspect &quot;social responsibility and social policy&quot;. The BSO sees the need for issues such as inclusion and inclusion, the protection of children and adolescents, the greening of sport in terms of sustainability, gender equality in sport, as well as the invaluable voluntary commitment, without which organized sport in this form is not exist, create awareness and use sport as a positive multiplier.

The initiative for the &quot;Daily Gymnastics lesson&quot; 2012/13 was also a successful move to draw attention to the health of the children. With more than 150,000 supporters it was possible to raise awareness of the importance of daily exercise units for children and adolescents. The BSO was able to reach a broad public with this initiative.

===Media cooperations and events===
Cooperations with the media, companies and initiatives are a central part of sports advocacy for the BSO. In order to be able to best represent the member associations and various sports, the BSO is committed to promoting the values and concerns of sport through partnerships, campaigns and events to communicate to a broad public.

===BSO Cristall Gala===
At the BSO Cristall Gala, Austria&#x27;s best coaches, officials, sports clubs and sports ambassadors are awarded each year by the BSO in cooperation with the Ministry of Sport. There is also a women&#x27;s power award. All member associations of the BSO and their associations are entitled to nominate personalities and projects that meet the requirements for the respective categories.

<doc id="745249" wikidata="Q909592" url="?curid=745249" title="Washington Square Park">
<text>Washington Square Park is a public park in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan, New York City. It is an icon as well as a meeting place and center for cultural activity. The park is operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks).

The park is an open space, dominated by the Washington Square Arch at the northern gateway to the park, with a tradition of celebrating nonconformity. The park&#x27;s fountain area has long been one of the city&#x27;s popular spots, and many of the local buildings have at one time served as homes and studios for artists. Many buildings have been built by New York University, while others have been converted from their former uses into academic and residential buildings.
==Location and features==

Located at the foot of Fifth Avenue, the park is bordered by Washington Square North (known as Waverly Place east and west of the park), Washington Square East (known as University Place north of the park), Washington Square South (known as West 4th Street east and west of the park), and Washington Square West (known as MacDougal Street north and south of the park).

While the park contains many flower beds and trees, little of the park is used for plantings due to the paving. The two prominent features are the Washington Square Arch and the Tisch Fountain. It includes children&#x27;s play areas, trees and gardens, paths to stroll on, a chess and scrabble playing area, park benches, picnic tables, commemorative statuary and two dog runs.

Those commemorated by statues and monuments include George Washington; Italian patriot and soldier Giuseppe Garibaldi, commander of the insurrectionist forces in Italy&#x27;s struggle for unification; and Alexander Lyman Holley, a talented engineer who helped start the American steel industry after the invention of the Bessemer process for mass-producing steel.

The New York City Police Department operates security cameras in the park. The area has a low crime rate in the &quot;safest big city in the United States.&quot;

==History==
===Early usage ===

The land was once divided by a narrow marshy valley through which Minetta Creek (or Brook) ran. In the early 17th century, a Native American village known as Sapohanikan or &quot;Tobacco Field&quot; was nearby. By the mid-17th century, the land on each side of the Minetta was used as farm land by the Dutch. The Dutch gave the land, then outside the city limits (Wall Street) to Angolan residents of the colony, intending for their plots and settlement to serve as a buffer zone to Native Americans outside the settlement. In 1643, a group of &quot;half-freed&quot; slaves and elders such as Domingo Anthony, Manuel Trumpeter and Catalina Anthony, received land grants to build and maintain farms in the areas containing and surrounding Washington Square Park. The families who received the land were no longer slaves, but had to give a portion of the profits they received from the land to the Dutch West India Company and pay annual land fees. Their children would be born as slaves, rather than free. The area became the core of an early African American community in New York, then called the Land of the Blacks and later &quot;Little Africa&quot;. Among those who owned parcels in what is now Washington Square Park was Paulo D&#x27;Angola.

It remained farmland until April 1797, when the Common Council of New York purchased the fields to the east of the Minetta (which were not yet within city limits) for a new potter&#x27;s field, or public burial ground. It was used mainly for burying unknown or indigent people when they died. But when New York (which did not include this area yet) went through yellow fever epidemics in the early 19th century, most of those who died from yellow fever were also buried here, safely away from town, as a hygienic measure.

A legend in many tourist guides says that the large elm at the northwest corner of the park, Hangman&#x27;s Elm, was the old hanging tree. However, research indicates the tree was on the side of the former Minetta Creek that was the back garden of a private house. Records of only one public hanging at the potter&#x27;s field exist. Two eyewitnesses to the recorded hanging differed on the location of the gallows. One said it had been put up at a spot where the fountain was prior to 2007 park redesign. Others placed the gallows closer to where the arch is now. However, the cemetery was closed in 1825. To this day, the remains of more than 20,000 bodies rest under Washington Square. Excavations have found tombstones under the park dating as far back as 1799.

===Creation of Washington Square===

In 1826, Alderman Abraham Valentine &quot;introduced a resolution to re-appropriate an old potter&#x27;s field into a military parade ground,&quot; and the city bought the land west of Minetta Creek, the square was laid out and leveled, and it was turned into the Washington Military Parade Ground. Military parade grounds were public spaces specified by the city where volunteer militia companies responsible for the nation&#x27;s defense would train.

The streets surrounding the square became one of the city&#x27;s most desirable residential areas in the 1830s. The protected row of Greek Revival style houses on the north side of the park remains from that time.

In 1849 and 1850, the parade ground was reworked into the first park on the site. More paths were added and a new fence was built around it. In 1871, it came under the control of the newly formed New York City Department of Parks, and it was redesigned again, with curving rather than straight secondary paths.

===Construction of the arch===
In 1889, to celebrate the centennial of George Washington&#x27;s inauguration as president of the United States, a large plaster and wood Memorial Arch was erected over Fifth Avenue just north of the park. Freemasons from St. John&#x27;s Lodge No. 1 lead a procession through the arch with the George Washington Inaugural Bible for the Centennial Parade of Washington&#x27;s Inauguration. The temporary plaster and wood arch was so popular that in 1892, a permanent Tuckahoe marble arch, designed by the New York architect Stanford White, was erected, standing and modeled after the Arc de Triomphe, built in Paris in 1806. During the excavations for the eastern part of the arch, human remains, a coffin, and a gravestone dated to 1803 were uncovered below ground level.

The first fountain next to the arch was completed in 1852 and replaced in 1872. In 1851, it was described as having &quot;a very large circular basin, with a central jet and several side jets.&quot; A story on the completion of the fountain appeared in the first edition of the &quot;New-York Daily Times&quot;, which would eventually become the &quot;New York Times&quot;. The statue of Giuseppe Garibaldi was unveiled in 1888. In 1918, two statues of George Washington were added to the north side.

===Early 20th-century renovation===
Robert Moses became the parks commissioner in 1934. He embarked on a crusade to fully redesign the park, and local activists began an opposing fight that lasted three decades.

In 1934, Robert Moses had the fountain renovated to also serve as a wading pool. In 1952, Moses finalized plans to extend 5th Avenue through the park. He intended to eventually push it through the neighborhood south of the park, as part of an urban renewal project. Area residents, including Eleanor Roosevelt, opposed the plans. The urbanist Jane Jacobs became an activist and is credited with stopping the Moses plan and closing Washington Square Park to all auto traffic, but Jacobs, in her book &quot;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&quot;, praised another local advocate in the fight against park traffic, Shirley Hayes: &quot;Hayes and the Washington Square Park Committee advocated eliminating the existing road, that is, closing the park to all automobile traffic – but at the same time, not widening the perimeter roads either. In short, they proposed closing off a roadbed without compensating for it.&quot;

Hayes, former chairman of the Washington Square Park Committee and member of the Greenwich Village Community Planning Board, a local resident and mother of four sons, started a public outcry for the park in 1952 when a large, modern apartment building was constructed on the northwest corner of Washington Square North and Fifth Avenue. When then-Manhattan borough president Hulan E. Jack suggested an elevated pedestrian walkway over a four-lane road through the park, Ms. Hayes initiated &quot;Save the Square!&quot;, a seven-year battle to keep automobiles out of the quiet area. Though several different proposals were given for a roadway in the park, Hayes and her followers rejected them all. Seeking to &quot;best serve the needs of children and adults of this family community,&quot; Hayes in turn presented her own proposal: 1.75 acres (700 m2) of roadway would be converted to parkland, a paved area would be created for emergency access only, and all other vehicles would be permanently banned from the park. This plan received widespread support, including that of then-Congressman John Lindsay, as well as Washington Square Park West resident Eleanor Roosevelt. After a public hearing in 1958, a &quot;ribbon tying&quot; ceremony was held to mark the inception of a trial period in which the park would be free of vehicular traffic. In August 1959, the efforts of Ms. Hayes and her allies paid off; from that time forward Washington Square Park has been completely closed to traffic. A plaque commemorating her tireless crusade can be seen in the park today. Hayes&#x27;s papers are archived at the New-York Historical Society.

===Mid- and late 20th century===

Following the end of World War II, folksingers had been congregating on warm Sunday afternoons at the fountain in the center of the park. Tension and conflicts began to develop between the bohemian element and the remaining working-class residents of the neighborhood. The city government began showing an increasing hostility to the use of public facilities by the public and, in 1947, began requiring permits before public performances could be given in any city park.

In the spring of 1961, the new parks commissioner Newbold Morris refused a permit to the folksingers for their Sunday afternoon gatherings, because &quot;the folksingers have been bringing too many undesirable [beatnik] elements into the park.&quot; On April 9, 1961, folk music pioneer Izzy Young, owner of the Folklore Center—who had been trying to get permits for the folksingers—and about 500 musicians and supporters gathered in the park and sang songs without a permit, then held a procession from the park through the arch at Fifth Avenue, and marched to the Judson Memorial Church on the other side of the park. At about the time the musicians and friends reached the church, the New York City Police Department Riot Squad was sent into the park, attacked civilians with billy clubs, and arrested 10 people. The incident made the front pages of newspapers as far away as Washington, DC. The &quot;New York Mirror&quot; initially reported it as a &quot;Beatnik Riot&quot;, but retracted the headline in the next edition, although tensions remained for a while.

The bus-turnaround loop at the northern end of the park, surrounding Washington Square Arch, was modified in 1961. Part of the old loop was closed and replaced with turf, and a set of stanchions were installed around the remaining parts of the loop. In 1962, Manhattan borough president Edward R. Dudley announced plans to close off two vehicular roadways in Washington Square Park that were used by emergency vehicles, as well as the bus turnaround loop. This move would add of parkland. As part of a redevelopment of the park, a skating rink and bandshell would have been reconstructed. Later that year, a committee was organized to appoint a landscape architect for an $800,000 renovation of Washington Square Park.

The city studied a plan to add a fence around Washington Square Park in 1973.

Four pedestrians were killed in a car crash at the park in 1992, prompting NYU to suggest closing the section of University Place along the eastern side of the park. The proposal was highly controversial among local residents.

===Early 21st-century renovation===

NYC Parks first considered renovating the park in 2004, though the proposal was controversial. In 2005, the iconic fountain in the center of the park was officially named the Tisch Fountain following a $2.5 million donation. This change was met with some backlash from the community, especially considering that the Parks Department orchestrated the naming without consulting the City Council.

In December 2007, NYC Parks began construction on a project to redesign and refurbish Washington Square Park, which at the time was projected to cost $16 million. Changes to the park included moving the fountain off center to improve its visual alignment with the arch when viewed from above, replacing the perimeter fence with a taller fence, and flattening and shrinking the central plaza, the park&#x27;s politically contested gathering space. The plan also called for felling dozens of mature trees and installing ornamental water plumes in the fountain.

A spectrum of opponents had charged the mayor variously with privatizing the park and with social engineering park use, as part of a broader web of speculation schemes threatening nearby South Village and East Village communities and architecture. Five lawsuits were filed to challenge NYC Parks&#x27; renovation plans. In July 2006, New York County Supreme Court Justice Emily Jane Goodman enjoined any renovation work on the fountain or fountain plaza area, pending further review of the plans by the local community board, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, and the Art Commission, stating that NYC Parks had intentionally misrepresented the project in a scheme to secure its approval. The ruling was reversed on appeal. Another lawsuit challenging the art commission&#x27;s approval of the plan was dismissed. Two more lawsuits questioning the environmental review of the renovation project were heard in 2007 by the New York County Supreme Court, then dismissed.

Upon the completion of phase one of the park&#x27;s renovation on May 22, 2009, the Coalition for a Better Washington Square Park, a private organization, began raising money to &quot;hire off-duty cops and maintenance workers to patrol the park&quot; by the summer of 2010. On June 2, 2011, the eastern half of the park was reopened to the public, leaving only the park&#x27;s southwest corner under construction. In mid-August 2012, the new granite benches heated up to in the sun, seemingly vindicating community members who had charged that the renovations were primarily to discourage public use of the park. The entire renovation was completed in 2014 for $30.6 million.

In July 2020, the northwest lawn was reopened after a yearlong restoration which included new grass and sod for the over 39,000 square feet of green space. Funding for the $170,000 project was provided by Ray Dalio&#x27;s Dalio Philanthropies.

== Cultural importance ==
Washington Square has long been a hub for politics and culture in New York City. The first neighborhood organization established in New York City was created in support of the park. For over 100 years, the Washington Square Association has been helping to support and better the park and the surrounding neighborhood.

===Performers and entertainers===
The presence of street performers has been one of the defining characteristics of Washington Square Park. For many years, people visiting the park have mingled with the buskers, performers, musicians, and poets. Because of a change in policy on a 2010 rule that involved artists, the new ruling that was to come in on May 8, 2013, would involve entertainers. This could mean that performers could be fined $250 for the first offense and up to $1,000 for further violations. The 2010 rule on which the 2013 ruling was based stated that artists could not sell within 50 feet of a monument or five feet from any bench or fence.

Some holiday traditions in the park date back to 1924. Each December, the park is home to an annual tree-lighting ceremony as well as a Christmas Eve sing-along with carolers and festive music. Also, the Washington Square Music Festival, which began in 1953, has brought chamber music concerts to park-goers every summer.

===Protests and demonstrations===
In 1834, New York University decided to use prison labor to dress the stone for a new building, across from the park, as prison labor from Sing Sing was cheaper than hiring local stonemasons. This, the stonecutters of the city said, was taking the bread out of their mouths. They held a rally in Washington Square Park, and then held the first labor march in the city. That turned into a riot, and the 27th New York regiment was called out to quell the stonecutters. The regiment camped in Washington Square for four days and nights until the excitement subsided. New York University continued their use of prison labor.

On Labor Day September 2, 1912, approximately 20,000 workers (including 5,000 women) marched to the park to commemorate the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, which had killed 146 workers the year before. Many of the women wore fitted tucked-front blouses like those manufactured by the Triangle Shirtwaist Company. This clothing style became the working woman&#x27;s uniform and a symbol of female independence, reflecting the alliance of labor and suffrage movements. Over 25,000 people marched up Fifth Avenue from the park demanding women&#x27;s suffrage in 1915.

===Notable people===
In 1888, Robert Louis Stevenson, visiting the U.S. to seek medical help for his battle with consumption, talked to Mark Twain in the park.

In the years before and after World War I, the park was a center for many American artists, writers, and activists, including the photographer André Kertész, who photographed the square during winter. Later, the park was a gathering area for the Beat generation, folk, and hippie movements in the 1950s and 1960s; in 1958, musician Buddy Holly, a nearby resident of Greenwich Village, spent time in the park both listening to people play and helping guitarists with musical chords. Singers Bob Dylan and Joan Baez lived in the neighbouring eponymous hotel and her lyrics in &quot;Diamonds &amp; Rust&quot; state &quot;Now you&#x27;re smiling out the window of that crummy hotel over Washington Square.&quot;

On September 27, 2007, Democratic Presidential candidate Barack Obama held a rally at Washington Square; 20,000 people registered for the event, and the crowds overflowed past security gates set up as a cordon. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the rally &quot;as one of the largest campaign events of the year.&quot;

===On television and film===
Washington Square Park has appeared in many popular films and television shows, including &quot;Barefoot in the Park,&quot; &quot;Kids&quot;, &quot;Searching for Bobby Fischer&quot;, &quot;Fresh&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;The Astronaut&#x27;s Wife&quot;, &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, &quot;August Rush&quot;, &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot;, Gilmore Girls and &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;.

<text>A sin tax (also known as a sumptuary tax, or vice tax) is an excise tax specifically levied on certain goods deemed harmful to society and individuals, such as alcohol, tobacco, drugs, candy, soft drinks, fast foods, coffee, sugar, gambling, vaping, cannabis (wherever legal for recreational use) and pornography. In contrast to Pigovian taxes, which are to pay for the damage to society caused by these goods, sin taxes increase the price in an effort to decrease the use of these goods. Increasing a sin tax is often more popular than increasing other taxes. However, these taxes have often been criticized for burdening the poor and disproportionately taxing the physically and mentally dependent.

==Summary==
The enactment of sin taxes on harmful activities varies by jurisdiction. In many cases, sumptuary taxes are implemented to mitigate use of alcohol and tobacco, gambling, and vehicles emitting excessive pollutants. Sumptuary tax on sugar and soft drinks has also been suggested. Some jurisdictions have also levied taxes on recreational drugs such as cannabis where it has been legalized and regulated.

Revenue generated by sin taxes supports many projects imperative in accomplishing social and economic goals. American cities and counties have utilized funds from sin taxes to expand infrastructure, while in Sweden the tax for gambling is used for helping people with gambling problems. Public acceptance of sumptuary taxes may be greater than income tax or sales tax.

==Support==
*Proponents argue that the consumption of tobacco and alcohol, the behaviors associated with consumption, or both consumption and the behaviors of consumption, are immoral or &quot;sinful&quot;, hence the label &quot;sin tax&quot;. For example, Mayo Clinic anesthesiologists Michael Joyner and David Warner support increasing taxes on tobacco and alcohol, with the goal of using tax codes to help change behavior and improve health.
*Tobacco and alcohol consumption has been linked to a variety of medical problems. In the United States alone, over 440,000 annual deaths are considered to be related to smoking tobacco. A synthesis of 67 studies found that there was evidence indicating tobacco taxation is responsible for &quot;reducing smoking behavior among youth, young adults, and persons of low socioeconomic status, compared to the general population,&quot; although no evidence was found indicating this was true for long-term smokers or American Indians.
*Following the medical argument, consumers of tobacco and alcohol cause a greater financial burden on society by forcing others to pay for medical treatment of conditions stemming from such consumption, especially in most first-world countries with government-funded healthcare.
* The moral, medical and financial arguments are occasionally considered in contemporary news settings.

==Opposition==
*Sin taxes result in the illegal manufacture, smuggling and/or outright theft of the taxed products, sometimes for personal use but often for sale on the black market.
*Critics of sin tax argue that it is a regressive tax in nature and discriminates against the lower classes. Sin taxes are often assessed at a flat rate meaning they account for a much larger portion of the price of an x by the wealthy. Also, sin tax rates products such as alcohol or cigarettes typically do not account for ability to pay, therefore poor people pay a much greater share of their income as tax.

<text>Kid &#x27;n Play is an American hip-hop duo from New York City who were most popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It is composed of Christopher Reid (&quot;Kid&quot;) and Christopher Martin (&quot;Play&quot;) working alongside their DJ, Mark &quot;DJ Wiz&quot; Eastmond. Besides their musical careers, they also branched out into acting.

== History ==
=== Music career ===
The pair met while performing in rival high school groups the Turnout Brothers and the Super Lovers, and initially formed their duo under the name the Fresh Force Crew. In 1986, &quot;She&#x27;s a Skeezer&quot; and &quot;Rock Me&quot; were recorded. By 1987, they had changed their name to Kid &#x27;n Play.

Kid &#x27;n Play recorded three albums together between 1988 and 1991: &quot;2 Hype&quot; (1988), &quot;Kid &#x27;n Play&#x27;s Funhouse&quot; (1990), and &quot;Face the Nation&quot; (1991). Hurby &quot;Luv Bug&quot; Azor, the producer for Salt-N-Pepa (who had been a member of the Super Lovers with Play) served as Kid &#x27;n Play&#x27;s manager and producer during the early portion of their career. All three albums focused upon positive lyrics backed by pop-friendly instrumental tracks. Among the group&#x27;s most successful singles were 1989&#x27;s &quot;Rollin&#x27; with Kid &#x27;n Play&quot; (No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B singles chart), 1990s &quot;Funhouse&quot; (No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; rap singles chart), and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Gonna Hurt Nobody&quot; (another No. 1 rap hit). The group&#x27;s stage show highlighted their teen-friendly personalities, and dances such as their trademark, the Kick Step. Kid&#x27;s visual trademark was his hi-top fade haircut, which stood ten inches high at its peak. Martin regularly wore eight-ball jackets.

Kid &#x27;n Play were also notable for their dance known as the Kid n&#x27; Play Kickstep, first seen in their video &quot;Do This My Way,&quot; and described in the song &quot;Do the Kid n&#x27; Play Kickstep,&quot; from their first album, &quot;2 Hype&quot;. Also affectionately known as the &quot;Funky Charleston,&quot; it was influenced by the 1920s era dance The Charleston. The Kid n&#x27; Play Kickstep featured the new jack swing-aerobic dance moves typical of late 1980s urban street dancing. Unlike the original Charleston, the Kid n&#x27; Play Kickstep requires two participants instead of one. This dance also was made quite popular in Kid &#x27;n Play&#x27;s feature film &quot;House Party&quot;, in which Kid and Play have a dance competition with Tisha Campbell and Adrienne-Joi Johnson.

=== Acting careers ===
In addition to their music, Kid &#x27;N Play have starred together in six feature films, all based on hip hop culture-inspired characters and themes; the duo also appeared on the soundtrack albums to these films. Five of the Kid &#x27;n Play films are entries in the &quot;House Party&quot; series. The first two &quot;House Party&quot; films (1990&#x27;s &quot;House Party&quot; and 1991&#x27;s &quot;House Party 2&quot;) also featured the then-relatively unknown Martin Lawrence and Tisha Campbell, later stars of the former&#x27;s hit TV sitcom, &quot;Martin&quot;. In the early 1990s, &quot;House Party 3&quot; (1994) featured hip-hop/R&amp;B girl group TLC as the music group &#x27;Sex as a Weapon&#x27;. Kid &#x27;n Play were absent from the later fourth film in the series, &quot;House Party 4&quot; (2001), which has no connection to any of the prior films. Likewise, they appeared in a subsequent unrelated film, &quot;House Party 5&quot; (2013), in which the duo made a cameo appearance to show just how successful their characters have become since the events of &quot;House Party 3&quot;. They later made a silent cameo in the sixth installment, simply titled &quot;House Party&quot; (2023), which serves as a legacy sequel and reboot of the series. Unlike the older films, the 2023 film portrays their fictional personas as members of a cult, strongly implying that they &quot;sold&quot; their souls for wealth and fame. The first film was originally meant for DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince. Years later, in an interview with Halftimeonline.net, DJ Jazzy Jeff revealed: 

&quot;Class Act&quot;, produced in 1992, was a comedy in the same vein as the &quot;House Party&quot; films. For that film, Reid traded his trademark hi-top fade for braids instead. The haircut is used as a plot device in the film.

Kid &#x27;n Play even had their own NBC Saturday morning cartoon, &quot;Kid &#x27;n Play&quot;, for one season (1990). On the show, Kid &#x27;n Play&#x27;s characters were regressed to teenagers, but their recording careers remained intact, as did their comic personas. The real Kid &#x27;n Play appeared in live-action/animated wraparounds of the cartoons, but voice actors (again including close friend, Martin Lawrence) performed in the animated portions of the show. The show stressed positive role models, teaching kids how to get along and stay out of trouble. A 1992 Marvel Comics comic book based on the cartoon was printed for nine issues; the duo also shot some motivational segments for PBS, for the mathematics show &quot;Square One TV&quot; and &quot;Sesame Street,&quot; respectively&quot;.&quot;

Kid &#x27;n Play were featured in the Adult Swim animated special &quot;&quot; as themselves. They also returned to the &quot;House Party&quot; series, appearing in &quot;House Party: Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; in which they reprise their roles from the first three films. Since the events of the third film, the two have gone on to become music superstars and CEOs of their own record label- Kick Power Records (a venture they began in the third film).

=== After the duo ===
Reid continued acting, guest starring in a number of television sitcoms, including &quot;Full House&quot;, &quot;Sister, Sister&quot; and &quot;Smart Guy&quot; and hosting shows such as &quot;It&#x27;s Showtime at the Apollo&quot; and &quot;Your Big Break&quot;. Martin became a born-again Christian, and devoted his time to working on Christian-based hip-hop music projects. He eventually took his industry experience and founded HP4Digital Works, a multimedia company that provides pre- and post-production for film, digital, and live theater productions. He also founded Brand Newz, an online news magazine focusing on positive community leaders and events. Martin joined the faculty at North Carolina Central University in Durham, North Carolina as an Artist in Resident where he teaches a credited course titled &quot;Hip Hop in Context 101&quot;. Martin was also a judge for the 8th annual Independent Music Awards. 

In 2009, State Farm released a commercial featuring LeBron James dancing to the music of Kid &#x27;n Play. In October 2009, the duo appeared on the BET Hip Hop Awards where they did their trademark dance. On February 9, 2010, the duo appeared on &quot;The Mo&#x27;Nique Show&quot;. 

Reid made a cameo appearance at the end of the LMFAO video for &quot;Sorry for Party Rocking&quot;, which recalled Kid n Play&#x27;s House Party movies.

On July 15, 2015, Kid &#x27;n Play were interviewed for an episode of TV One&#x27;s &quot;Unsung&quot;. In 2020, Martin appeared in six episodes of the sitcom &quot;Church Folks. &quot;In November 2023, they appeared in a Progressive insurance ad, entitled &#x27;Watch Party&#x27;.

=== Later musical appearances ===

In 2009, the duo went on tour for the House Party anniversary along with other rappers such as Salt-n-Pepa. On June 23, 2010, the duo appeared on &quot;Lopez Tonight&quot; and performed &quot;Rollin&#x27; with Kid &#x27;n Play&quot; from their album &quot;2 Hype&quot;.

On February 27, 2012, Kid &#x27;n Play released an &quot;open letter,&quot; detailing planned future events. On July 30, 2012, Kid &#x27;n Play joined Salt-N-Pepa onstage at a concert in Brooklyn, New York. On July 23, 2013, the duo made a cameo appearance in the fifth House Party installment, &quot;House Party: Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;.

On February 2, 2014, the duo made a cameo appearance in the RadioShack Super Bowl XLVIII commercial, &quot;The &#x27;80s Called&quot;. On August 3, 2021, Kid &#x27;n Play were announced to be on the Insane Clown Posse&#x27;s 2021 Gathering of the Juggalos festival.

<doc id="745255" wikidata="Q787733" url="?curid=745255" title="BTX (form factor)">
<text>BTX (for Balanced Technology eXtended) is a form factor for motherboards, originally intended to be the replacement for the aging ATX motherboard form factor in late 2004 and early 2005.

It was designed to alleviate some of the issues that arose from using newer technologies (which often demand more power and create more heat) on motherboards compliant with the circa 1996 ATX specification. The ATX and BTX standards were both proposed by Intel. However, future development of BTX retail products by Intel was canceled in September 2006 following Intel&#x27;s decision to refocus on low-power CPUs after suffering scaling and thermal issues with the Pentium 4.

The first company to implement BTX was Gateway Inc, followed by Dell and MPC. The first generation of Apple&#x27;s Mac Pro used some elements of the BTX design system as well, but was not BTX-compliant, instead using a proprietary form factor.

==Enhancements==
*&quot;Low-profile&quot; – With the push for ever-smaller systems, a redesigned backplane that shaves inches off height requirements is a benefit to system integrators and enterprises who use rack mounts or blade servers.
*&quot;Thermal design&quot; – The BTX layout establishes a straighter path of airflow with fewer obstacles, resulting in better overall cooling capabilities. There is no dedicated CPU fan – instead, a large 12 cm case fan is mounted, drawing its air directly from outside the computer and cooling the CPU through an airduct. Another distinct feature of BTX is the vertical mounting of the motherboard on the left-hand side. This results in the graphics card heatsink or fan facing upwards, rather than in the direction of the adjacent expansion card.
*&quot;Structural design&quot; – The BTX standard specifies different locations for hardware mounting points, thereby reducing latency between key components and also reduces the physical strain imposed on the motherboard by heat sinks, capacitors and other components dealing with electrical and thermal regulation. For example, the Northbridge and Southbridge chips are located near each other and to the hardware they control like CPU, RAM and expansion ports (PS/2, USB, LPT etc.)

===picoBTX===

Pico BTX is a motherboard form factor that is meant to miniaturize the BTX standard. Pico BTX motherboards measure . This is smaller than many current &quot;micro&quot;-sized motherboards, hence the name &quot;pico&quot;. These motherboards share a common top half with the other sizes in the BTX line, but support only one or two expansion slots, designed for half-height or riser card applications.

Other smaller BTX sizes include: microBTX at and nano BTX at .

The heat sink to be attached to the CPU, called &quot;Thermal Module&quot; throughout the official specification, is no longer attached solely to the motherboard, but to the casing itself, so that the inertial load of its mass during a mechanical shock event can no longer damage the motherboard.

The structural interface between the heat sink and the chassis, is defined as 4 mounting holes with the distances of 4.4 × 2.275 in (55.79 × 111.76 mm) between one another. And since this attachment means is also required to have a certain stiffness, it is called &quot;Support and Retention Module (SRM)&quot; in the specification.

==Reception==

The BTX form factor has not been widely adopted despite its improvements over ATX and related standards. As a result, the availability and variety of BTX-compatible components is limited.

One reason for the failure of BTX to gain traction in key markets was the rise of energy-efficient components (CPUs, chipsets and GPUs) which require less power and produce less waste heat, eliminating two of the primary intended benefits of BTX. Another reason was the lack of OEM adopters.

Initially, only Gateway and Dell offered computers with the new format, later HP and Fujitsu-Siemens (now Fujitsu) also offered some BTX-based computers. Most other manufacturers stayed with the ATX standard, and even the handful of manufacturers who did adopt BTX for some products continued to produce the bulk of their machines with the ATX form factor.

<text>State Route 152 (SR 152) is a state highway that runs from east to west near the middle of the U.S. state of California from State Route 1 in Watsonville to State Route 99 southeast of Merced. Its western portion (which is also known as Pacheco Pass Road and Pacheco Pass Highway) provides access to and from Interstate 5 toward Southern California for motorists in or near Gilroy and San Jose.

==Route description==
Route 152 begins near Route 1 as a series of local streets that run through downtown Watsonville: East Lake Avenue carries it to the intersection of Casserly Road. This point marks the start of a winding two-lane highway that crosses the Santa Cruz Mountains through Hecker Pass to reach Gilroy. In Gilroy, it is again carried on a series of local streets, then overlapped onto U.S. Route 101 for a small stretch before it separates again a short distance to the south and returns to heading east/west on more local streets in Gilroy.

After exiting the large commercial developments near U.S. 101, Route 152 consists of a single lane in each direction, with narrow shoulders, rain ditches on either side of the road, no center dividers, and posted speed limit of 55 mph (89 km/h), making it prone to head-on collisions. Headlights are required at all times along this portion. This segment is a significant bottleneck for traffic traveling along Route 152 between the San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Valley. Upon reaching Route 156 near Hollister, the road expands to two lanes in each direction, and climbs and curves along the valley of Pacheco Creek into the mountains of the Diablo Range, crossing them through the Pacheco Pass into the San Joaquin Valley.

SR 152 is one of the three major routes that cross the Diablo Range after Interstate 580 and State Route 46. Pacheco Pass is higher than Altamont Pass to the north, but lower than Polonio Pass to the south.

Route 152 continues as a four-lane divided expressway, descending along the northern and eastern shore of the massive San Luis Reservoir. The route passes in between the San Luis Dam and the O&#x27;Neill Forebay. The route continues east and passes a large Path 15 substation and then meets Interstate 5 as an expressway. It becomes a speed-limited city street, Pacheco Blvd., while passing through Los Banos. It then returns to an expressway until its eastern terminus at Route 99. Here, eastbound 152 traffic merges into southbound 99 a few miles northwest of the city of Madera, and approximately 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Fresno. Motorists wishing to travel north on Route 99 are advised to take Route 233 north through Chowchilla to connect to northbound 99. Another possible northbound route exists by exiting Route 152 at State Route 59, and proceeding directly north to the city of Merced, where Route 59 meets Route 99.

The landmarks located on Route 152 include the Pacheco Pass, the Gilroy Gardens, the San Luis Reservoir, the Casa de Fruta and the Merry Cherries.

SR 152 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and east of US 101 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 152 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, and from the Merced–Santa Clara county line to I-5 is officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation, meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a &quot;memorable landscape&quot; with no &quot;visual intrusions&quot;, where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community.

==History==

The road became popular as a route east during the California Gold Rush. The Butterfield Overland Mail ran along this route from 1858 to 1861. A portion of Route 152 from Bell Station to Pacheco Pass was a toll road from 1857 until 1878. In that year, Merced County and Santa Clara County purchased the toll road and replaced it with a new road built as a public highway, part of which is now a segment of Whiskey Flat Trail in Pacheco State Park. In 1915, the road became part of the state highway system, and in 1923, the state completed the third road through the pass. Historic references say the portion of the route west of SR 33 was named &quot;Legislative Route 32&quot; before being designated State Route 152.

The 1923 state route over the pass had numerous curves and steep grades. In 1934, 3.3 miles of the road eastward from the summit was realigned and widened. In 1939, a realignment of 2.6 miles of highway was completed eastward from the Pacheco Reservoir area (starting about a mile east of Bell Station). In 1950, the first four-lane expressway segment was constructed from the 1939 alignment to near the Merced County line, a distance of 3.26 miles. The 1934 alignment is now Dinosaur Point Road, while the 1939 and 1950 alignments continue to be in use today as part of SR 152.

In 1963-65, a new 12-mile four-lane expressway, with climbing lanes for trucks, was built from the Merced County line eastward, to bypass the San Luis Reservoir which was then under construction. A three-mile stretch of the bypassed road continues to be in use as Dinosaur Point Road, providing access to a boat launch ramp at the reservoir.

Between 1982 and 1992, the road was widened in two phases from two to four lanes, with some realignments, on a 10.5-mile segment from the four-lane section completed in 1950 to just east of the junction with California State Route 156. The first phase, from the 1950 segment west to Bell Station, was completed in 1984. The second phase, from Bell Station to Route 156, was constructed from 1990 to 1992, with an interchange built at Casa de Fruta. In 2008, a T-junction and stop sign at the intersection with Route 156 on the remaining two-lane section of the highway west of Casa de Fruta was replaced with a flyover, greatly easing congestion there.

A segment of Route 152 west of Gilroy, between the Uvas Creek Bridge and Santa Teresa Blvd, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. This segment of the road, serving as a western gateway into Gilroy, is lined with deodar cedar trees that were planted on consecutive Arbor Days in 1930 and 1931.

<text>Slow Wave was a weekly comic strip by Jesse Reklaw. It syndicated to alternative newspapers around the U.S. starting in 1995, and also appeared online. &quot;Slow Wave&quot; changed style twice since its inception, and ended publication in 2012.

==Description==
From 1995 to 2011 the strip was a collective dream diary authored by people from around the world. Readers would submit their dreams to the artist and were credited as authors of the resulting cartoon. Reklaw illustrated each dream in four panels, paring down the dreamer&#x27;s commentary to a few sentences. Reklaw has said he likes dreams because they have &quot;their own logic and a natural Dada-like humor.&quot; The strip&#x27;s name refers to the EEG rhythms of REM sleep.

== Publication history ==
From 1995 to 2009, each episode of the strip would illustrate a dream by a single reader. The strip took the form of two rows of two panels.

In 2009 Reklaw introduced continuity into the strip, with characters encountering situations based on the dreams submitted by the readers. Individual strips would sometimes depict a mixture of dreams by different readers, and situations introduced in one episode sometimes persisted into the next. The strip also changed format to a horizontal arrangement of panels.

In January 2012 Reklaw ceased illustrating dreams for the strip and switched to a fictional continuity. Soon afterward the strip ended.

The anthology &quot;Dreamtoons&quot; collects 109 episodes from the first five years of the strip.

<text>Washington Square, originally designated in 1682 as Southeast Square, is a open-space park in Center City, Philadelphia, The southeast quadrant and one of the five original planned squares laid out on the city grid by William Penn&#x27;s surveyor, Thomas Holme. It is part of both the Washington Square West and Society Hill neighborhoods. In 2005, the National Park Service took over ownership and management of Washington Square, through an easement from the City of Philadelphia. It is now part of Independence National Historical Park.

==History==
By the early 18th century the square started being used as a burial ground. Originally divided into triangles by two creeks, the northwestern portion was the potter&#x27;s field, and the southeastern section was for the burial of Catholics. The joining of the creeks created a fishing pond, and the grounds were commonly used for grazing by neighbors&#x27; cows.

In 1776, it became the final resting place for Washington&#x27;s fallen soldiers. Long mass grave trenches the width of the square were first dug along 7th and Walnut Streets, and were eventually expanded to the South side. And during the British occupation of Philadelphia in 1777, the dead from the neighboring Walnut Street Jail were also interred here. Many victims of the city&#x27;s yellow fever epidemic of 1793 were interred here, and the square was also used for cattle markets and camp meetings.

The square was closed as a cemetery, and improvement efforts began in 1815, as the neighborhoods around the square were developed and became fashionable. In 1825, the park was named Washington Square in tribute to George Washington and a monument to Washington was proposed. This monument was never built but served as the seed for the eventual tribute to soldiers of the Revolutionary War.

The periphery of Washington Square included an area called Lawyer&#x27;s Row at 6th and Walnut, on the site of the former Walnut Street Prison. Around the square was also home to the city&#x27;s publishing industry, including the Curtis Publishing Company, J. B. Lippincott, W. B. Saunders, Lea &amp; Febiger, the Farm Journal, and George T. Bisel Co., law publishers, now the sole remaining publishing house on the square, with Franklin Jon Zuch serving as president since 1992. It has been located there since 1876 and still owned by the Bisel family.

== American Civil War ==
Initially, the square contained monuments to those who had fought in the American Civil War. One such monument was the Washington Grays Monument. In 1954, the decision was made to remove the civil war commemorations and focus the square solely on the memory of the American Revolutionary War.

==Tomb of the Unknown Revolutionary War Soldier==

In 1954, the Washington Square Planning Committee decided that, instead of the original proposed monument to Washington, a monument to all soldiers and sailors of the Revolutionary War would be built. The monument, designated the &quot;Tomb of the Unknown Revolutionary War Soldier&quot;, was designed by architect G. Edwin Brumbaugh and includes a bronze cast of Houdon&#x27;s statue of Washington as the monument&#x27;s centerpiece. The Tomb includes remains which were disinterred, after archeological examination, from within the park from when it was a cemetery. The remains are that of a soldier, but it is uncertain if he was Colonial or British. An unknown number of bodies remain buried beneath the square and the surrounding area; some are still occasionally found during construction and maintenance projects.

==Moon Tree==
A sycamore Moon tree in the square, planted in 1975, was grown from seeds that had been carried to the Moon by astronaut Stuart Roosa on the Apollo 14 mission. The Moon tree died in 2009 and was replaced with a clone in 2011, which had also died as of November 2019, leaving the plaque about the Moon tree in place.

==In popular culture==
The pop-punk group The Wonder Years wrote about Washington Square in their song &quot;Washington Square Park&quot;, from their album &quot;The Upsides&quot;.
