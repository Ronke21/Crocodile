<doc id="731286" wikidata="Q268925" url="?curid=731286" title="Use Your Illusion Tour">
<text>The Use Your Illusion Tour was a concert tour by American rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses which ran from January 20, 1991, to July 17, 1993. It was not only the band&#x27;s longest tour, but one of the longest concert tours in rock history, consisting of 192 shows in 27 countries. It was also a source of much infamy for the band, due to riots, late starts, cancellations and outspoken rantings by Axl Rose.

==History==
The Use Your Illusion Tour was a promotional tour for the albums &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; and &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;. The tour started on May 24, 1991, approximately when the long-awaited follow-up to &quot;G N&#x27; R Lies&quot; was to be released, and ended over two years later. The release date of the album, or albums, since there were now two of them, was pushed back to September but the tour began as originally scheduled. The tour marked a high point in the popularity of Guns N&#x27; Roses, with a total of over 7 million fans attending, and accompanied by high worldwide album sales.

Live recordings from the tour would be issued as a two video/DVD set, &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; (featuring footage from a 1992 concert in Tokyo, Japan) and provide content for the 2-disc set &quot;Live Era: &#x27;87-&#x27;93&quot;. The tour also provided footage for music videos, including &quot;Dead Horse&quot; and their popular cover of Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;. A planned documentary, titled &quot;The Perfect Crime&quot;, included footage consisted of the band&#x27;s time on the road, concert clips, and information about the riots and other major events of the tour. It was never released and never spoken about after the tour. Slash mentioned in his biography that Axl Rose controls the footage and that Slash would be interested in viewing it, as he thought it captured &quot;killer moments&quot; from the tour.

The conduct of the band, and particularly Axl Rose, during the Use Your Illusion Tour generated negative press, notably from the magazines &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, &quot;Circus&quot;, and &quot;Hit Parader&quot;. These magazines were mentioned in the song &quot;Get in the Ring&quot; where Axl Rose attacked writers who had written negative articles dealing with Rose&#x27;s attitude.

The shows were all varied, as a setlist was never chosen by the band. They did, however, usually open with &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy&quot;, &quot;Nightrain&quot; or &quot;Perfect Crime&quot; and would shortly after one another play &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot; or &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, and close with &quot;Paradise City&quot;. Each show featured guitar solos from Slash (including the &quot;Theme From the Godfather&quot;) and a drum solo from drummer Matt Sorum, usually six minutes in length.

The tour was massive not just in the number and size of performances, but also in its technical aspects and the size of the crew. A total of 130 working personnel traveled with the band, using two different stages to enable faster setup. The trade magazine &quot;Performance&quot; named the tour crew &quot;Crew of the Year&quot; for 1991.

Duff McKagan revealed in 2015 that the band didn&#x27;t make profit on the tour until 1993 due to the extravagant costs.

&quot;The band had such a ball,&quot; Slash remarked in 1994. &quot;We managed to tour for two and a half years, against all the fuckin&#x27; odds. It really was a fuckin&#x27; endurance test of pretty big proportions.&quot;

==Notable events==
At the June 10, 1991, show, at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, Axl Rose requested that the crowd chant &quot;Get in the ring!&quot; This was recorded for the song of that name on &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;.

On June 13, 1991, during the show in Philadelphia, Rose erupted after a fan fought with Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; photographer Robert John. When the fan kicked the camera out of his hands, Rose cursed him out and challenged him to a fight. After the fan was ejected from the concert, the show continued.

On Tuesday, July 2, 1991, at a show at the Riverport Amphitheatre in Maryland Heights, Missouri, near St. Louis, Rose spotted a spectator recording the concert with a video camera and jumped into the audience after him when concert security failed to respond to his request to apprehend the man. Returning to the stage, Rose declared: &quot;Well, thanks to the lame-ass security, I&#x27;m going home!&quot; then slammed the mic on the stage, sparking the infamous Riverport riot. Rose then stormed off the stage; some people thought when he slammed the mic, because of the noise, that he shot someone. Slash told them, &quot;He just slammed his mic on the floor. We&#x27;re outta here.&quot; He proceeded to throw his guitar pick into the crowd and follow Rose. The band followed. The band was looking to come back out and finish the show, but as police and security tried to calm down the audience, a riot broke out. The footage was captured by Robert John who was documenting the entire tour. Sixty fans were injured. The band lost most of their equipment and Rose was charged with inciting a riot. He was acquitted due to lack of evidence. The band would later express their feelings regarding the incident by including the message &quot;fuck you, St. Louis!&quot; in the liner notes of both &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; albums.

On August 3, 1991, the day mixing of the &quot;Illusion&quot; albums was finished, the band played the longest show of the tour at the L.A. Forum. It lasted three and a half hours.

On November 7, 1991, Izzy Stradlin quit the band after the release of &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; and &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;; his last show was on August 31, 1991, at Wembley Stadium. On December 5, replacement rhythm guitarist Gilby Clarke made his debut in Worcester, at the first show after the release of &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; and &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;.

On April 13 and 14, 1992, two concerts had to be canceled when a warrant was issued for Rose&#x27;s arrest due to his behavior at the St. Louis show.

On April 20, 1992, the band performed at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, an effort for AIDS Awareness in London. The band was a controversial addition to the lineup, as many in the gay community were still angry over Rose using a homophobic slur in &quot;One in a Million.&quot; The band opened with &quot;Paradise City&quot; and closed with &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door.&quot; During the famous &quot;Paradise City&quot; opening, Axl pointed at protesters in the audience and yelled, &quot;SHOVE IT!&quot; He had planned to address the controversy between songs, but was asked not to by the band as it would pull the spotlight from Queen and Freddie Mercury. As Slash concluded a short cover of Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Only Women Bleed&quot;, Duff McKagan kept an eye on Rose, who approached the front of the stage. When Slash finished the song, then strummed the beginning of &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;, McKagan walked over to Rose and shook his hand in appreciation. Later in the show, Slash joined Joe Elliott of Def Leppard and the surviving members of Queen for &quot;Tie Your Mother Down.&quot; Rose sang &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and finished &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; with Elton John and Queen. The show was broadcast live around the world via satellite, gathering the largest audience for a music concert in history.

On August 8, 1992, in Montreal, Quebec, during the famously troubled Guns N&#x27; Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour portion, Metallica frontman/guitarist James Hetfield&#x27;s left arm was badly burned due to misunderstanding about pyrotechnics added to Metallica&#x27;s stage setup. Metallica was forced to end their set early. However, Guns N&#x27; Roses were not present at the arena to begin before the scheduled time, leaving fans to wait several hours before they took the stage. A few songs into the very late set, audio problems resulted in the band not being able to hear themselves play. Rose stormed off stage due to vocal issues, sparking a riot that spilled into the streets.

On November 30, 1992, the band performed for the first time in Bogotá, Colombia. When they started to play &quot;November Rain&quot;, a soft rain fell over the city and stopped right after they finished the song. Rose later stated this was a special moment for him because &quot;November Rain&quot; was #1 in Colombia for 60 weeks. Rose stated that the band were at risk of electrocution and must stop to dry the stage. The band moved backstage and returned to finish with &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; and &quot;Paradise City.&quot;

On December 2, 1992, the band performed in Santiago, Chile, at Estadio Nacional in front of 85,535 people, breaking an attendance record in the stadium. At their arriving at Chile, Rose attacked some graphic reporters and a cameraman was injured. Before the concert, Rose got drunk and arrived at the stadium two hours late. While the band performed &quot;Civil War&quot; some people threw bottles to the stage, and Rose stopped four minutes into the show. The concert ended with 50 people arrested outside the stadium, and a teenage fan with several injuries, dying two days later.

On February 1, 1993, the band performed at the Calder Park Raceway in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The concert started late due to earlier heavy rain, with minimal shelter available for those attending. The concert was fraught with controversy, including reports that security staff had prohibited patrons from bringing their own food, drinks and sunscreen into the venue; this most seriously affected a diabetic teenage girl, whose medication and carefully portioned food were confiscated. The weather was very hot on that day, reportedly , and reportedly 1000 people were treated for heat-related illness. Many concertgoers went to the venue on special shuttle buses, which left the venue shortly after Guns N&#x27; Roses performed their final song. This, combined with a refusal to extend train timetables, left many concertgoers stranded. There are reports that they walked all the way down the Calder Highway back to Melbourne, looting a 7-Eleven on the highway for food. An inquiry into the conditions was held, with the findings published by Ombudsman Victoria in May 1993. To this day, this was the last ever concert to be performed at Calder Park.

In February 1993, Gilby Clarke told BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Friday Rock Show&quot;: &quot;For the last year and a half, we had a film crew with us. They do film every show and things backstage: hotel rooms, everything. And what we&#x27;re gonna do at the end of the whole tour – which is actually after we&#x27;re done in Europe – is put it all together, and we are gonna make a movie. It&#x27;s pretty candid right now, so it&#x27;s gonna be really great. The difference between ours and is that ours isn&#x27;t scripted. This movie is actually things that are happening around us.&quot; He also said Guns N&#x27; Roses would record an &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; during their stay in Russia. Neither of these plans came to fruition.

Stradlin returned for several shows in 1993, deputizing for an injured Clarke. &quot;It was weird,&quot; he recalled. &quot;We toured Greece, Istanbul, London &quot;[sic]&quot;. I liked that side of it – seeing some places I&#x27;d never seen… [But] money was a big sore point. I did the dates just for salary… [At the end] I didn&#x27;t actually say &#x27;See you&#x27;, cos they were all fucked up… It was like playing with zombies.&quot;

On July 17, 1993, the band performed in Buenos Aires, Argentina at River Plate Stadium in front of 80,000 people. It was their last show with most of the &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot;-era lineup (Rose, Slash, McKagan, Sorum, Reed, and Clarke). The tour was renamed the &quot;Skin N&#x27; Bones Tour&quot; for the last couple of legs and included an unplugged performance in a living room set. A highlight of the night was Cozy Powell dressed as a Domino&#x27;s Pizza delivery boy playing drums with Sorum.

<text>In philosophy and AI (especially, knowledge-based systems), the qualification problem is concerned with the impossibility of listing &quot;all&quot; the preconditions required for a real-world action to have its intended effect. It might be posed as &quot;how to deal with the things that prevent me from achieving my intended result&quot;. It is strongly connected to, and opposite the ramification side of, the frame problem. John McCarthy gives the following motivating example, in which it is impossible to enumerate all the circumstances that may prevent a robot from performing its ordinary function:

<text>Clearview is a rural incorporated township in Simcoe County in Central Ontario, Canada, west of Barrie and south of Collingwood and Wasaga Beach in Simcoe County.

==History==

Human occupation of the area is evident starting in as early as the Paleo-Indian period.

Before the arrival of European settlers, the area of Clearview Township was part of the territory of the Petun, a confederation of Iroquoians who were closely related to the Huron and Neutral peoples. The Petun were ravaged by disease epidemics in the early 17th century and victim to raids by the Iroquois Confederacy (a part of the Beaver Wars), with much of their remaining population fleeing as refugees and vacating the territory. There are abundant archaeological remains in the township from the Petun period.

Early settlement on the site of Stayner coincided with the construction of the Toronto, Simcoe and Huron Railway between 1851 and 1855. The community of Stayner, which was originally called Nottawasaga Station, developed into a significant agricultural and lumbering centre. Stayner was incorporated as a village in 1872, and as a Town in 1888. The Village of Creemore was incorporated effective 20 November 1889.

Before incorporation, New Lowell was the site of a timber plant owned by Jacques and Hay.

Clearview Township was established on January 1, 1994, when the Town of Stayner, the Village of Creemore and the Townships of Nottawasaga and Sunnidale were amalgamated. The Townships of Nottawasaga and Sunnidale had been incorporated in 1851 and 1858, respectively.

==Geography==
The township comprises the communities of Avening, Batteaux, Brentwood, Cashtown Corners, Creemore, Dunedin, Duntroon, Glen Huron, Maple Valley, New Lowell, Nottawa, Pretty River Valley, Singhampton, Smithdale, Stayner, Sunnidale, Sunnidale Corners and Websterville.

It borders on the following municipalities:
*North Collingwood, Wasaga Beach
*East Springwater, Essa
*South Adjala-Tosorontio, Mulmur, Melancthon
*West Grey Highlands, The Blue Mountains

Clearview (and Simcoe County in general) is part of Central Ontario as well as the Georgian Triangle. The climate in the area is classified as Humid Continental (Warm Summer Subtype).

==Attractions==
Creemore was one of the original claimants for the location of Ontario&#x27;s smallest jailhouse. Its jailhouse, with dimensions at 4.5 metres by 6 metres, make it smaller than the other early claimants, Tweed, and Coboconk; however, others in Rodney, Port Dalhousie, Providence Bay, and Berens River are smaller. Today, the jail has been converted into a museum.

There are two arenas (Stayner, Creemore), three Baseball Parks (Nottawa, Stayner, with the largest being in New Lowell) and 3 Golf Courses (Duntroon Highlands, Batteaux Creek Golf Club, Mad River Golf and Country Club) in Clearview. The Bruce Trail runs along the Niagara Escarpment in the western part of the township, and there is a cross-country skiing centre in Duntroon.

<doc id="731302" wikidata="Q1815450" url="?curid=731302" title="Miami Floridians">
<text>The Miami Floridians, later in their history known simply as The Floridians, were a professional basketball franchise in the original, now-defunct American Basketball Association. The Miami Floridians played in the ABA from 1968 through 1970 when they became simply The Floridians. The team had two color schemes: their original red, blue, and white, and their later black, magenta, and orange.

The Miami Floridians began as the Minnesota Muskies, a charter ABA franchise who played in Bloomington, Minnesota at the Met Center and wore blue and gold. The Muskies finished with the league&#x27;s second-best record, but wretched attendance figures (officially 2,800 per game, a figure that was likely padded) led owner Larry Shields to conclude that the team could not be viable in the Twin Cities. He sold minority shares to a group of Florida businessmen and moved the team to Miami. However, in order to pay leftover debts in Minnesota, Shields sold Rookie of the Year Mel Daniels to the Indiana Pacers, a deal now reckoned as the most lopsided trade in ABA history.

==Move to Miami==
The Floridians never attracted a large following, despite numerous promotions—including ballgirls wearing white bikinis and go-go boots. However, the team did manage to make the playoffs three out of the four years of their existence. The Floridians&#x27; first homes were the Miami Beach Convention Center and the Convention Center Annex. Coached by former Minneapolis Lakers great Jim Pollard, the 1968–69 season was the most successful for the Miami Floridians by far, finishing their first season in Florida with a 43–35 record and defeating the defending champion Minnesota Pipers (who played in the city the Floridians had just abandoned) in the Eastern Division semifinals 4 games to 3, before losing in the divisional finals to the Indiana Pacers 4 games to 1.

The 1969–70 season was largely forgettable for the Miami Floridians. They split their home games between Dinner Key Auditorium and Miami-Dade Junior College&#x27;s North Campus gym. Dinner Key, a former aircraft hangar, was perhaps the most infamous building in ABA history. It had no air conditioning and would often get quite hot inside, forcing management to throw open the doors; players would then have to adjust their shots by the ocean breezes that whistled onto the court. The Floridians dismissed Pollard during the season and named Hal Blitman of Cheyney State College as their head coach. The minority partners began taking a greater role in team operations, often trading players without Blitman&#x27;s knowledge. Not surprisingly given the constant turnover on the roster, the Floridians finished 23-61 and missed the playoffs. The team&#x27;s original owners, Shields and Fred Jefferson, sold the Floridians at the end of the season.

==The Floridians==
Following the 1969–70 season, new owner Ned Doyle dropped &quot;Miami&quot; from the team&#x27;s name and made it a &quot;regional&quot; franchise, scheduling games in Miami (back at the Miami Beach Convention Center), Tampa-St. Petersburg at the Curtis Hixon Hall and Bayfront Arena, Jacksonville at the Jacksonville Memorial Coliseum, and in West Palm Beach at the West Palm Beach Auditorium. In an unprecedented move, Doyle &quot;fired&quot; the entire team (all players were either traded or released prior to the start of their new season) and kept the coach. The team replaced Blitman after an 18–30 start with Bob Bass. Bass was able to turn the team around and the Floridians finished fourth in the Eastern Division with a record of 37–47. The Floridians made the playoffs, but lost their series to the Kentucky Colonels, 4–2.

For the 1971–72 season, the Floridians split their home games between Miami and Tampa. They again finished in fourth place in the Eastern Division, with a record of 36–48. Once again the team made the playoffs and once again they lost their series, this time to the Virginia Squires, 4–0.

The Floridians has to use the gymnasium of Dade County Junior College for their two playoff games reportedly because the Center had booked other events not thinking the team would make the playoffs. The dreadful attendance for their two home playoff games against the Squires convinced Doyle that the team could not be viable in South Florida. After a deal to relocate to Cincinnati fell through and attempts to find a bigger market in Albuquerque, San Diego, and Omaha turned up nil for different reasons, he disbanded the franchise in what was considered to be a tax write-off in June 1972. Ironically, San Diego would end up getting their own ABA expansion team in the San Diego Conquistadors in what essentially became a replacement for both The Floridians and the Pittsburgh Condors (who also considered San Diego as an option to move their franchise before shutting down operations) months later. Big-time basketball wouldn&#x27;t return to Florida until the NBA expansion team, the Miami Heat, played their first season in 1988. The Orlando Magic followed suit with them a year later.

The Heat franchise paid tribute to the Floridians franchise in recent years by wearing near replicas (the jerseys instead had &quot;Miami&quot; on the front to go along with a smaller &quot;Floridians&quot; wordmark on the shorts) of the 1970–71 (and 71-72) Floridians home and away uniforms for several games in the 2005–06 and 2011–12 seasons as part of the NBA&#x27;s &quot;Hardwood Classics Night&quot; program.

<doc id="731319" wikidata="Q1609755" url="?curid=731319" title="Hereditary fructose intolerance">
<text>Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is an inborn error of fructose metabolism caused by a deficiency of the enzyme aldolase B. Individuals affected with HFI are asymptomatic until they ingest fructose, sucrose, or sorbitol. If fructose is ingested, the enzymatic block at aldolase B causes an accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate which, over time, results in the death of liver cells. This accumulation has downstream effects on gluconeogenesis and regeneration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Symptoms of HFI include vomiting, convulsions, irritability, poor feeding as a baby, hypoglycemia, jaundice, hemorrhage, hepatomegaly, hyperuricemia and potentially kidney failure. There are reported deaths in infants and children as a result of the metabolic consequences of HFI. Death in HFI is always associated with problems in diagnosis.

HFI is an autosomal recessive condition caused by mutations in the &quot;ALDOB&quot; gene, located at 9q31.1. HFI is typically suspected based on dietary history, especially in infants who become symptomatic after breast feeding. This suspicion is typically confirmed by molecular analysis Treatment of HFI involves strict avoidance of fructose in the diet. Older patients with HFI typically self-select a diet low in fructose, even before being diagnosed.

==Presentation==
The key identifying feature of HFI is the appearance of symptoms with the introduction of fructose to the diet. Affected individuals are asymptomatic and healthy, provided they do not ingest foods containing fructose or any of its common precursors, sucrose and sorbitol. In the past, infants often became symptomatic when they were introduced to formulas that were sweetened with fructose or sucrose. These sweeteners are not common in formulas used today. Symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, restlessness, pallor, sweating, trembling and lethargy can also first present in infants when they are introduced to fruits and vegetables. These can progress to apathy, coma and convulsions if the source is not recognized early.

When patients are diagnosed with HFI, a dietary history will often reveal an aversion to fruit and other foods that contain large amounts of fructose. Most adult patients do not have any dental caries.

== Fructose metabolism ==
After ingestion, fructose is converted to fructose-1-phosphate in the liver by fructokinase. Deficiencies of fructokinase cause essential fructosuria, a clinically benign condition characterized by the excretion of unmetabolized fructose in the urine. Fructose-1-phosphate is metabolized by aldolase B into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde. HFI is caused by a deficiency of aldolase B.

A deficiency of aldolase B results in an accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate, and trapping of phosphate (fructokinase requires adenosine triphosphate (ATP)). The downstream effects of this enzyme block are the inhibition of glucose production and reduced regeneration of ATP.

== Diagnosis ==
Because of the ease of therapy (dietary exclusion of fructose), HFI can be effectively managed if properly diagnosed. In HFI, the diagnosis of homozygotes is difficult, requiring a genomic DNA screening with allele-specific probes or an enzyme assay from a liver biopsy. Once identified, parents of infants who carry mutant aldolase B alleles leading to HFI, or older individuals who have clinical histories compatible with HFI can be identified and counselled with regard to preventive therapy: dietary exclusion of foods containing fructose, sucrose, or sorbitol. If possible, individuals who suspect they might have HFI should avoid testing via fructose challenge as the results are non-conclusive for individuals with HFI, and even if the diagnostic administration of fructose is properly controlled, profound hypoglycemia and its sequelae can threaten the patient&#x27;s well-being.

== Treatment ==
Treatment of HFI depends on the stage of the disease, and the severity of the symptoms. Stable patients without acute intoxication events are treated by careful dietary planning that avoids fructose and its metabolic precursors. Fructose is replaced in the diet by glucose, maltose or other sugars. Management of patients with HFI often involves dietitians who have a thorough knowledge of what foods are acceptable.

<doc id="731343" wikidata="Q181329" url="?curid=731343" title="Brindley Benn">
<text>Brindley Horatio Benn, CCH (24 January 1923 – 11 December 2009) was a teacher, choirmaster, politician, and one of the key leaders of the Guyanese independence movement. He was put under restriction when the constitution was suspended in 1953. In 1957, Benn served as Minister of Community Development and Education in the first elected government of Guyana, and between 1961 and 1964 as Minister of Natural Resources. From 1993 to 1998, he served as High Commissioner of Guyana to Canada.

==Early life==

Born in Kitty, Georgetown, Brindley Horatio Benn, named for the Methodist minister J.B. Brindley, was the second of two boys born to Rosa and Samuel Benn. He attended St. James-the-Less Primary School (now F. E. Pollard), Kitty, and also briefly attended a Roman Catholic School in Queenstown. Benn wrote his Junior and Senior Cambridge Examinations at the Central High School. He gained five subjects at Junior Cambridge – English Language, English History, Literature, Latin and French. He sat five subjects at Senior Cambridge but did not matriculate, since he did not pass Mathematics.

===Early career===
After finishing school, Benn travelled to Kwakwani to work as a clerk with the Bauxite Company. His parents were living in the mining community at the time and his father was a senior staff member at the Reynolds Mining and Metals Company. His mother was a caterer and a boarding house proprietor in the community, where she became popular for her activity in social and community life. Samuel Benn died in Kwakwani in 1948 and was buried there. Rosa remained in the community until the early 1960s, when she returned to Georgetown.

Benn returned to Georgetown in the early 1940s when the Bauxite Company started to scale down the workforce. He began teaching at a secondary school (currently the Richard Ishmael Secondary School) and briefly had his own school, Georgetown Secondary, which was located in Evans Street. He operated the school for about three years.

===Choir involvement===
Benn was a chorister at St. James the Less Anglican Church with Choirmasters who included the late Claude Merriman. He later became Choir Master at the St. Sidwell&#x27;s Anglican Church around 1945 and served for about five years, until the Choir was disbanded. The Choir competed successfully at several choir festivals and became very popular with the public, especially its Friday practice sessions. St. Sidwell&#x27;s Choir was the smallest at the time when it performed Stainer&#x27;s &quot;The Crucifixion&quot; and was noted for performing some of the most difficult choral pieces then in existence. The organist was the legendary Carl Welshman. Some members of Benn&#x27;s chorister group included the late broadcaster Matthew Allen, Senior Counsel Lloyd Joseph and Wittington Braithwaite.

After the Choir disbanded, Benn went to teach Latin and French at Richard Ishmael&#x27;s Secondary School, where he organized a school choir which put on a concert at the Georgetown City Hall. He spent three years there.

==Political activity==

One evening, during his teaching career, Benn attended a public meeting at Norton and John Streets, where he listened to Dr. Cheddi Jagan criticise the state of the bauxite industry and the colony of Guyana. Impressed by Dr. Jagan&#x27;s speech, Benn joined the People&#x27;s Progressive Party the same night. He immediately became very involved in politics, an avocation that led to conflict with his superior at the Secondary School. The principal, Richard Ishmael, was also President of the Manpower Citizens&#x27; Association, a union which represented sugar workers but which was widely considered a company union.

Benn subsequently left the school and became even more deeply involved in politics. He formed the Pioneer Youth League, the forerunner to the Progressive Youth Organisation (PYO).

===Arrest and relocation===
When the colonial constitution was suspended in 1953, Benn was detained and put under restriction orders in New Amsterdam, where he had gone to assess Party activity. He was ordered to report to the police between 8 and 10 a.m. every day except Sunday. His wife and three children regularly commuted by train to visit him where he lived with his brother, Lancelot, who worked as a driver mechanic with PWD at Canje.

After several raids by the army and the police on his brother&#x27;s home, it was decided that his wife and family would move to New Amsterdam, where they established residence at 21 St. Magdelane Street. They lived there from 1954 to 1956 and the family increased by two with the birth of twins.

===Party office===
Upon his return to Georgetown in 1956, Benn was elected Chairman of the People&#x27;s Progressive Party (PPP) and Member of the Executive Committee. The PPP contested the 1957 elections with Benn as the representative of the Essequibo Islands and the Interior. That single constituency comprised the largest single land area being contested in the country, and he came up against the candidacy of Mr. E. F. Corriea. He broke the long occupancy of the seat by Mr. Corriea when he won the election.

Benn was appointed Minister of Community Development and Education in 1957 and given an office across the road from the Parliament Building. During that time that he organised the National History and Culture Week (1961–1964) under the theme &#x27;One People, One Nation, One Destiny&#x27;, which later became independent Guyana&#x27;s motto.

After the 1961 general elections, which the PPP also won, Benn was appointed Minister of Natural Resources. During this time he conceptualised and founded the Guyana School of Agriculture (1963). He oversaw the implementation of the Mahaica Mahaicony Abary (MMA) Scheme, Boersarie Scheme, Tapacuma Scheme and the Black Bush Polder – all major drainage and irrigation schemes.

===Further strife===
During the disturbances in the early 1960s, Benn was imprisoned by the British. During this period, the British successfully split the PPP along racial lines—the originally nationalist and multi-ethnic PPP became the party that was allegedly the party of Indo-Guyanese, whereas most Afro-Guyanese joined the People&#x27;s National Congress (PNC). Brindley Benn became the most prominent Afro-Guyanese to remain with the PPP, making a statement against the divide-and-rule tactics of colonialism. The PPP was removed from office in 1964 by the political machinations of the British (&quot;see History of Guyana.&quot;) Several Ministers and other important persons were detained. Among them was Brindley Benn, who was confined at Sibley Hall of Mazaruni Prison for several months.

===A new direction===
After his release in 1965, Benn became disenchanted by the differences in opinion in the PPP. He moved away from the party to establish his own – the Working People&#x27;s Vanguard Party (WPVP). The WPVP printed a weekly mimeographed account of social, economic and political affairs occurring locally and internationally. Benn was for a time strongly attracted to the Maoist vision of a peasant-led social revolution. In the late 1970s, he joined with Walter Rodney, Eusi Kwayana, Andaiye, Moses Baghwan and Rupert Roopnaraine to form the Working People&#x27;s Alliance. Discussions were held under the umbrella organization Patriotic Coalition for Democracy (PCD) in the fight for free and fair elections in Guyana.

===Political renaissance===
In 1992, with the return of democracy to Guyana, the PPP were returned to office by free and fair elections. Benn accepted President Dr. Jagan&#x27;s offer to be on the PPP&#x27;s list of candidates and won a seat in Parliament. He was later appointed Guyana&#x27;s High Commissioner to Canada, a position he held with distinction from 1993 to 1998.

Upon his return to Guyana, Brindley Benn served as Chairman of the Public Service Commission for three years. He was also a member of the Teaching Service Commission and the Police Service Commission. Benn was the Chairman of the Guyana Lotteries Commission and served on the Appeals Board of the Guyana Revenue Authority.

==Death==
Brindley died on 11 December 2009, aged 86, after a long illness.

==Personal life==
Benn was a member of St. Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church at Plaisance and of its Men&#x27;s Guild.

He married his wife Patricia in 1951; they remained together throughout his life. The Benns had seven children – including fraternal twins – and eight grandchildren.

His son, Robeson Benn is a government minister.

<text>West Nipissing is a municipality in Northeastern Ontario, Canada, on Lake Nipissing in the Nipissing District. It was formed on January 1, 1999, with the amalgamation of seventeen and a half former towns, villages, townships and unorganized communities.

It is the most bilingual community in Ontario, with 73.4% of its population fluent in both English and French.

==Communities==

The primary administrative and commercial centre of West Nipissing is the community of Sturgeon Falls, which is situated on the Sturgeon River, north of Lake Nipissing and west of North Bay on Highway 17, part of the Trans-Canada Highway. Roughly half the population of West Nipissing lives in Sturgeon Falls.

Field is located on Highway 64, approximately north of Sturgeon Falls. In 1979, the Sturgeon River overflowed its banks, flooding the town&#x27;s centre. Many houses were demolished and rebuilt on higher ground nearby. The Thistle Fire Tower is to be dismantled and re-erected here as a tourist attraction. Logging, farming and outdoor recreational activities are main village industries.

Verner is located on the Veuve River (Rivière Veuve), at the western junction of highways 17 and 64, approximately west of Sturgeon Falls. The largely francophone community serves as an agricultural hub for the surrounding area and offers a consumers&#x27; cooperative and farm equipment dealers. The town was named for the wife of Canadian Pacific Railway superintendent Archer Baker, who oversaw the laying of track through the West Nipissing area in the 1880s.

Many of the francophone settlers immigrated to the area from Michigan in the late 19th century in order to preserve their language; they were concerned they would lose their language in the predominantly anglophone United States. Many of the families that settled in Lavigne and Verner came from the Lanaudière region of Quebec from villages such as St-Félix-de-Valois, St-Gabriel-de-Brandon and Ste-Élisabeth.

Smaller communities in the municipality include Cache Bay, Caderette, Crystal Falls, Desaulniers, Evansville, Harfred, Kirk, Lavigne, Notre-Dame-du-Lac, Domrémy and River Valley. It also includes part of the North Monetville area, which straddles the boundary between West Nipissing and French River. The Nipissing First Nation is also located nearby and is closely associated with West Nipissing.

Cache Bay, named after the nearby water feature on a &quot;hidden bay&quot; of Lake Nipissing, had a post office that was established in 1889.

==History==
The original inhabitants of the area are the N&#x27;Biissing, an Anishinabek people, and many N&#x27;Biissing still inhabit the area today. A trading post was founded in the last quarter of the 18th century on an island on Lake Nipissing at the mouth of the La Vase River, called Fort La Ronde and was operated by Louis Denis de la Ronde (1675–1741). Fort La Ronde was moved numerous times to different islands on Lake Nipissing. It was later sold to North West Company. It was later bought by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company around 1820 and was later relocated on the right bank of the river several hundred metres below the falls, at the mouth of Sturgeon River, trading with the N&#x27;Biissing for furs and other goods. James R. Holditch of Utterson, Ontario is generally credited as being the first permanent non-aboriginal settler in the area. He arrived in 1878 and built a cabin on the left bank, near the waterfalls. Nowadays, the Sturgeon River House Museum sits where the HBC trading post was. It was founded as a centennial project in 1967 by the Historical Restoration Committee of the Sturgeon Falls Secondary High School, the Township of Springer and the Town of Cache Bay, in cooperation and funded by the Government of Canada and the Government of Ontario. It was renovated and re-opened in 1999 and upgraded to include a permanent building capable of being open year-round and vastly improved its exhibits. It is now an agency of the Municipality of West Nipissing and supports the West Nipissing tax base.

The region began to grow in the 1880s, with the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) and the efforts of Fr. Charles Alfred Marie Paradis, an Oblate missionary, to develop an agricultural settlement for Franco-Ontarians in the Verner area.

The development of Sturgeon Falls began in 1881 with the arrival of Canadian Pacific Railway construction crews. The area&#x27;s first post office was opened in Sturgeon Falls in 1881. Lumbering and the establishment of pulp and paper industries accelerated the village&#x27;s growth and attracted many French-Canadian settlers to the area.

The addition of sawmills and the rapid growth of the lumbering and pulp and paper industries stimulated the development of the village and attracted many French-Canadian settlers to the area. The town of Sturgeon Falls was incorporated on April 16, 1895. At the time, J. A. Lévis was elected the first mayor and the population was 850.

The Canadian Pacific Railway was joined by the Canadian Northern Railway in 1915, with its line between Capreol and North Bay. This line later became the Canadian National Railway Alderdale Subdivision, with station stops (from east to west) in Harfred, Crystal Falls, Ashburton, Field, Desaulniers, and River Valley, along with several industrial spurs to serve local industries. CN rail service declined in the mid-20th century and was eliminated altogether in 1996.

The community of Field suffered two significant natural disasters in the 1970s. On August 20, 1970, it was hit by a small tornado associated with the Sudbury tornado event. In the spring of 1979 the Sturgeon River overflowed its banks at Field, causing massive flooding in the town&#x27;s centre. Half the town that was located in the flood plain was relocated to higher ground two kilometres south of the original town centre on Highway 64. This new location is known as New Field (Val-des-Arbres).

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, West Nipissing had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
==Transportation==
Ontario Northland motor coach service makes scheduled stops in Sturgeon Falls and Verner.

==Media and education==

The region is served primarily by broadcast stations from North Bay and Sudbury. Two commercial radio stations, CFSF-FM and CHYQ-FM, broadcast from Sturgeon Falls.

The area has a bilingual weekly newspaper, &quot;Tribune: West Nipissing This Week / La Voix du Nipissing Ouest&quot;, which was previously called &quot;The Sturgeon Falls Tribune&quot;. It is also served by the daily &quot;North Bay Nugget&quot;.

Students attend either Northern Secondary School (École secondaire publique Northern) or École secondaire catholique Franco-Cité.

<doc id="731365" wikidata="Q1334556" url="?curid=731365" title="George B. Cortelyou">
<text>George Bruce Cortelyou (July 26, 1862October 23, 1940) was an American cabinet secretary of the early twentieth century. He served in various capacities in the presidential administrations of Grover Cleveland, William McKinley, and Theodore Roosevelt.

Born in New York City, Cortelyou worked for the United States Post Office Department and came to the attention of Postmaster General Wilson S. Bissell. On Bissell&#x27;s recommendation, President Cleveland hired Cortelyou as his chief clerk. On Cleveland&#x27;s recommendation, McKinley hired Cortelyou as his personal secretary. After the assassination of William McKinley, Roosevelt asked Cortelyou to lead an effort to reorganize the White House.

Impressed with Cortelyou&#x27;s performance, Roosevelt appointed him United States Secretary of Commerce and Labor in 1903. He left this position in 1904 to become chairman of the Republican National Committee, and in 1905 he also served as Postmaster General. He left both positions to become the United States Secretary of the Treasury in 1907. In this position, he worked to keep the economy stable during the Panic of 1907. After Roosevelt left office in 1909, Cortelyou became president of the Consolidated Gas Company. He died in 1940.

==Early life==
Cortelyou was born in New York City to Rose (&quot;née&quot; Seary) and Peter Crolius Cortelyou Jr. He was a member of an old New Netherlandish family whose immigrant ancestor, Jacques Cortelyou, arrived in 1652. He was educated in the public schools of Brooklyn, at Nazareth Hall Military Academy in Pennsylvania, and at Hempstead Institute on Long Island.

At the age of 20, Cortelyou received a BA degree from Westfield Normal School, now Westfield State University, a teachers&#x27; college in Westfield, Massachusetts. He earned law degrees from George Washington University and Georgetown University. He was a member of the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity while at George Washington University. Cortelyou then began teaching, later taking a stenography course and mastering shorthand. On September 15, 1888, Cortelyou married the former Lily Morris Hinds, with whom he had five children.

==Early career==

In 1891 he obtained a position as secretary to the chief postal inspector of New York. The following year, a promotion led to a position as secretary to the Fourth Assistant Postmaster General in Washington, D.C. In 1895, President Grover Cleveland hired Cortelyou as his chief clerk on the recommendation of Postmaster General Wilson S. Bissell. Cleveland recommended him as personal secretary to his successor, William McKinley. Cortelyou was working to improve the efficiency of the office when President McKinley was assassinated in 1901. He was the third president to be assassinated.

McKinley was greeting visitors at the Temple of Music at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, on September 6, 1901, when he was shot twice at close range by lone assassin Leon Czolgosz, a twenty-eight-year-old anarchist. As McKinley collapsed, he was caught and supported by his aides, including Cortelyou. As he was held in their arms, he whispered, &quot;My wife... be careful, Cortelyou, how you tell her. Oh, be careful.&quot; He died eight days later at the age of fifty-eight.

After succeeding McKinley as president, Theodore Roosevelt charged Cortelyou with transforming the White House into a more professional organization. Cortelyou developed procedures and rules that guided White House protocol and established processes for which there had been only personal prerogative. Cortelyou is also credited with establishing an improved line of communication between the President&#x27;s office and the press; he provided reporters with their own work space, briefed journalists on major news events, and distributed press releases. Cortelyou is credited with establishing the first systematic collection of press clippings for a sitting president to review. The &quot;Current Clippings&quot; were the first attempt by a president to gauge public opinion through the media. Cortelyou selected the articles objectively, a practice not consistently followed by his successors.

==Roosevelt&#x27;s administration==

Cortelyou served as the first Secretary of Commerce and Labor from February 18, 1903, to June 30, 1904. He also served as Postmaster General from March 6, 1905, to January 14, 1907, and was Secretary of the Treasury, all under Theodore Roosevelt. From 1904 to 1907, Cortelyou also served as chairman of the Republican National Committee, working for the successful re-election of Theodore Roosevelt.

On April 9, 1903, he was made an honorary member of the Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity. He had attended the New England Conservatory of Music, where the fraternity was founded.

Cortelyou served as Secretary of the Treasury from March 4, 1907, to March 7, 1909. This was during the devastating Panic of 1907. Like his predecessor, Leslie M. Shaw, Cortelyou believed it was the duty of the Treasury to protect the banking system, but he realized that the Treasury was not equipped to maintain economic stability. He mitigated the crisis by depositing large amounts of government funds in national banks and buying government bonds. To prevent future crises, Cortelyou advocated a more flexible currency and recommended the creation of a central banking system.

In 1908, the Aldrich–Vreeland Act was passed, providing for a special currency to be issued in times of panic and creating a commission that led to the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913.

==Later life, death, and legacy==
He returned to the private sector as president of the Consolidated Gas Company, later known as Consolidated Edison. He was also one of the chairmen of the Con Edison Energy Museum, which is now closed. He lived at his home &quot;Harbor Lights&quot; in Halesite, Long Island until his death in October 1940. Edith Roosevelt attended the wake at his home, as she was a close friend of his wife. He is buried in the Memorial Cemetery of St. John&#x27;s Church in Laurel Hollow, New York. Cortelyou, an unincorporated community in Washington County, Alabama, changed its name from Richardson to Cortelyou while George Cortelyou was United States Postmaster General. In 1942, a Liberty ship was to be named for him; this ship later became the cargo ship USS &quot;Cetus&quot;.

<text>Toy dog traditionally refers to a very small dog or a grouping of small and very small breeds of dog. A toy dog may be of any of various dog types. Types of dogs referred to as toy dogs may include spaniels, pinschers and terriers that have been bred down in size. Not all toy dogs are lap dogs.

== Small dogs ==



Dogs found in the toy group of breed registries may be of the very ancient lapdog type, or they may be small versions of hunting dogs or working dogs, bred down in size for a particular kind of work or to create a pet of convenient size. In the past, very small dogs not used for hunting were kept as symbols of affluence, as watchdogs, and for the health function of attracting fleas away from their owners.

== Breeds ==
Most major dog clubs in the English-speaking world have a toy group, under one exact name or another, in which they place breeds of dog that the kennel club categorizes as &quot;toy&quot;, based on size and tradition. The Kennel Club (UK), the Canadian Kennel Club, the American Kennel Club, the Australian National Kennel Council, and the New Zealand Kennel Club all have a group named &quot;Toy&quot;, although they may not all categorise the same breeds in this category. The United States has a second major kennel club, the United Kennel Club (UKC, originally formed for hunting and working breeds, though general today), and it does not recognize such a group; instead, small dogs are placed with larger dogs of their type, or into a UKC&#x27;s &quot;Companion Dog&quot; group. the American Kennel Club began debating whether or not to change the name of their &quot;Toy&quot; group to &quot;Companion&quot;, in order to emphasise that dogs are not playthings, but the name change was resisted by traditionalists.

The breeds in the &quot;Companion and Toy&quot; category of the Fédération Cynologique Internationale are:

* Bichon Frisé
* Bichon Havanais, Havanese
* Bolognese
* Boston Terrier
* Bouledogue Français, French Bulldog
* Caniche, Poodle
* Cavalier King Charles Spaniel
* Chihuahueño, Chihuahua
* Chin, Japanese Chin
* Chinese Crested Dog
* Coton de Tuléar
* Epagneul Nain Continental, Continental Toy Spaniel: Papillon, Phalène
* Griffon Belge
* Griffon Bruxellois, Brussels Griffon
* King Charles Spaniel
* Kromfohrländer
* Lhasa Apso
* Maltese
* Pekingese
* Petit Brabançon, Small Brabant Griffon
* Petit Chien Lion, Löwchen, Little Lion Dog
* Pug
* Russkiy Toy
* Shih Tzu
* Tibetan Spaniel
* Tibetan Terrier

Small or toy-sized breeds not classified by the FCI in its toy group include:

* Affenpinscher
* Australian Silky Terrier
* Italian Greyhound
* Miniature Pinscher
* Dwarf German Spitz: Pomeranian
* Volpino Italiano
* Yorkshire Terrier
* Xoloitzcuintle

Member kennel clubs of the Fédération Cynologique Internationale and non-member clubs may use slightly different nomenclature, depending on the country. The term &quot;toy&quot; is only used to group dogs for show purposes.

Some breeds without FCI recognition are recognised by The Kennel Club of Great Britain (UK), by the Canadian Kennel Club (Can), or by the American Kennel Club:

* Chihuahua (Long Coat) (UK, Aus, NZ, Can)
* Chihuahua (Smooth Coat) (UK, Aus, NZ)
* Chihuahua (Short Coat) (Can)
* Mi-Ki (US)
* Toy Fox Terrier (US)
* Toy Manchester Terrier (Can, US)

The major national kennel club for each country will have its own list of breeds that it recognizes as Toy. In addition, some new or newly documented rare breeds may be awaiting approval by a given kennel club. Some new breeds may currently be recognized only by their breed clubs. Some rare new breeds have been given breed names, but may only be available from the breeder or breeders who are developing the breed, and may not yet be recognized by any kennel club.

In addition to the major registries, there are a plethora of sporting clubs, breed clubs, and internet-based breed registries and businesses in which dogs may be registered in whatever way the owner or seller wishes.

<doc id="731387" wikidata="Q7705863" url="?curid=731387" title="Testicular self-examination">
<text>Testicular self-examination (TSE) is a procedure where a man examines his own testicles and scrotum for possible lumps or swelling. It is usually undertaken at home while standing in front of a mirror and after having a warm bath or shower. Monthly self-examination of the testicles starting at puberty may be an effective way of detecting testicular cancer at an early, potentially treatable stage, which can lead to a 5-year survival rate of 98%. In men aged 15 to 40, testicular cancer is the most common cancer, and the annual rate of increase over the last 10 years in cases of testicular cancer is approximately 1% each year. Testicular cancer typically presents with a painless testicular swelling or a lump or any change in shape or texture of the testicles.

TSE is also indicated if there are certain risk factors present, such as a family history of testicular cancer. Additionally, outside of the possible early detection of testicular cancer, other &quot;off label&quot; uses of TSEs include detection of indirect inguinal hernias, varicocele, and infections that may affect the testicles, such as mumps. The efficacy of TSEs in detection of these pathologies relies on proper technique, but if done correctly, TSEs can be very beneficial to the health of the individual and have many public health benefits as well.

==Uses==
Monthly self-examination of the testicles, starting at puberty, may be an effective way of detecting testicular cancer at an early, and potentially treatable stage. Recommendations vary with some physicians recommending the use of monthly TSE for men ages 15 to 55.

Practitioners may recommend testicular self-exam (TSE) when the following risk factors are present:
* Family history of testicular cancer
* Past testicular tumor
* Undescended testicle
* Testicular atrophy

==Professional guidelines==
There is no general medical consensus for recommendations on TSE. The effectiveness of performing TSE in reducing morbidity and mortality from testicular cancer is not known. Not all organizations endorse the procedure as a screening test, arguing that it may lead to unnecessary treatments and unnecessary anxiety. The benefit of TSE is uncertain due to there being no randomized control trial studying the use of TSE. Many organizations have established guidelines regarding the utilization of testicular self examination as well as the use of testicular examination by a medical provider as a diagnostic tool. These guidelines can be found in the table below.

== Technique ==
For men who choose to perform TSE, it is recommended to perform TSE once monthly, at approximately the same time every month. Performing TSE during or after a warm bath or shower may help to relax the skin of the scrotum and make the structures within the scrotum easier to feel.

Existing guidelines indicate that TSE is best performed in the standing position. Individuals performing TSE may choose to stand in front of a mirror in order to visualize the scrotum and testicles from various angles. First, the scrotum and testicles may be visually examined for any skin changes or visible swelling. Then, with the thumb placed on the upper surface and the index and middle finger placed on the lower surface, each testicle can be rolled between the thumb and fingers to feel for potential findings. It is also recommended to locate and feel the epididymis, a soft, rope- or tube-like structure that runs behind each testicle, in order to avoid confusing this structure for a potentially abnormal finding.

==Findings==
Normal findings during TSE include testicles that feel round, smooth, and homogenous in texture, and that are mobile within the scrotum. It is normal and common for one testicle to be larger and hang lower in the scrotum than the other.

Findings that may be abnormal and should be discussed with healthcare providers include:
* Pain or tenderness to touch
* Firm lumps
* Swelling or fluid buildup
* Changes in testicular size or the relative size of both testicles, compared to the individual&#x27;s baseline

==Limitations==
The effectiveness of performing routine TSE in men without symptoms in reducing morbidity and mortality from testicular cancer is not clear, and as such, not all organizations endorse the procedure as a screening test, arguing that it may lead to unnecessary treatments. Additionally, some signs and symptoms of testicular cancer found during TSE are common to other disorders of the male urinary tract and reproductive organs, including hydrocele testis, spermatocele, genitourinary system cancers, urinary tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, or testicular torsion, which may prompt medical attention to preserve reproductive and urinary function. These potential false positives may cause unnecessary concern or anxiety to patients.

==Society and culture==
Testicular self-examination has generally low rates of practice in part because young men have very low rates of health-seeking behaviors, leading to higher rates of mortality and morbidity. This is likely influenced by the fact that men face potential perceived societal pressures and judgement, which create obstacles to these patients seeking care.

==History==
Charlottenburgh and Lancaster were two of the original eight &quot;Royal Townships&quot;, established along the Saint Lawrence River in Upper Canada in the 1780s. This area was first settled by United Empire Loyalists. The development of this area was encouraged by Sir John Johnson, then the Superintendent General and Inspector General of Indian Affairs, who had been forced to abandon his land holdings in New York State during the American Revolution. Johnson built a house in Williamstown; the home was completed in 1785 and is now a Canadian National Historic Site, the Sir John Johnson Manor House. A grist mill and saw mill, now gone, were also built on the same location. Williamstown also has the oldest house in Ontario, The Bethune-Thompson House built in 1784. Occupants over the years have included the Reverend John Bethune (1751–1815), the great-great-grandfather of Doctor Norman Bethune, and David Thompson, Canadian explorer.

From the late 18th century to the early 19th century, the area was almost entirely settled by Scottish highlanders, especially from Inverness-shire, after the Highland Clearances. Canadian Gaelic / Scottish Gaelic had been spoken in Glengarry County since its first settlement in 1784.

Some of the main partners of the North West Company, including Hugh McGillis, lived in this area.
Alexander McMartin, the first person born in Upper Canada to serve in the Legislative Assembly, was from Martintown.

The Glengarry Celtic Music Hall of Fame is located in Williamstown. The Nor&#x27;Westers and Loyalist Museum is also located in Williamstown.

Williamstown is also home to Ontario&#x27;s oldest continuing agricultural fair, which celebrated its bicentennial in 2012.

South Glengarry is the location of four National Historic Sites of Canada: the Bethune-Thompson House, the Glengarry Cairn, the Sir John Johnson House, and the ruins of St. Raphael&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church.

St. Raphael&#x27;s Catholic Church was completed in 1821 under the authority of Alexander Macdonell later Bishop of Regiopolis (now Kingston, Ontario). This is one of the oldest churches in what was then the colony of Upper Canada. In late 1970, the church interiors, roof and tower were destroyed by fire, but the ruins were preserved. In 1973, a smaller church with the same name was built, attached to the ruins.

The township was established on January 1, 1998, with the amalgamation of the former Townships of Charlottenburgh and Lancaster, along with the Village of Lancaster.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, South Glengarry had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


==Culture==
Canadian author Hugh Hood mentions Williamstown in his short story &quot;Getting to Williamstown,&quot; first published in 1928.

<doc id="731401" wikidata="Q1779030" url="?curid=731401" title="Ideal solution">
<text>An ideal solution or ideal mixture is a solution that exhibits thermodynamic properties analogous to those of a mixture of ideal gases. The enthalpy of mixing is zero as is the volume change on mixing. The vapor pressures of all components obey Raoult&#x27;s law across the entire range of concentrations, and the activity coefficient (which measures deviation from ideality) is equal to one for each component.

The concept of an ideal solution is fundamental to both thermodynamics and chemical thermodynamics and their applications, such as the explanation of colligative properties.

== Physical origin ==

Ideality of solutions is analogous to ideality for gases, with the important difference that intermolecular interactions in liquids are strong and cannot simply be neglected as they can for ideal gases. Instead we assume that the mean strength of the interactions are the same between all the molecules of the solution.

More formally, for a mix of molecules of A and B, then the interactions between unlike neighbors (&quot;U&quot;AB) and like neighbors &quot;U&quot;AA and &quot;U&quot;BB must be of the same average strength, i.e., 2 &quot;U&quot;AB = &quot;U&quot;AA + UBB and the longer-range interactions must be nil (or at least indistinguishable). If the molecular forces are the same between AA, AB and BB, i.e., &quot;U&quot;AB = &quot;U&quot;AA = &quot;U&quot;BB, then the solution is automatically ideal.

If the molecules are almost identical chemically, e.g., 1-butanol and 2-butanol, then the solution will be almost ideal. Since the interaction energies between A and B are almost equal, it follows that there is only a very small overall energy (enthalpy) change when the substances are mixed. The more dissimilar the nature of A and B, the more strongly the solution is expected to deviate from ideality.

== Formal definition ==
Different related definitions of an ideal solution have been proposed. The simplest definition is that an ideal solution is a solution for which each component obeys Raoult&#x27;s law formula_1 for all compositions. Here formula_2 is the vapor pressure of component formula_3 above the solution, formula_4 is its mole fraction and formula_5 is the vapor pressure of the pure substance formula_3 at the same temperature.

This definition depends on vapor pressure, which is a directly measurable property, at least for volatile components. The thermodynamic properties may then be obtained from the chemical potential μ (which is the partial molar Gibbs energy &quot;g&quot;) of each component. If the vapor is an ideal gas,

:formula_7

The reference pressure formula_8 may be taken as formula_9 = 1 bar, or as the pressure of the mix, whichever is simpler.

On substituting the value of formula_2 from Raoult&#x27;s law, 
:formula_11

This equation for the chemical potential can be used as an alternate definition for an ideal solution.

However, the vapor above the solution may not actually behave as a mixture of ideal gases. Some authors therefore define an ideal solution as one for which each component obeys the fugacity analogue of Raoult&#x27;s law formula_12. Here formula_13 is the fugacity of component formula_3 in solution and formula_15 is the fugacity of formula_3 as a pure substance. Since the fugacity is defined by the equation 
:formula_17

this definition leads to ideal values of the chemical potential and other thermodynamic properties even when the component vapors above the solution are not ideal gases. An equivalent statement uses thermodynamic activity instead of fugacity.

== Thermodynamic properties ==
=== Volume ===
If we differentiate this last equation with respect to formula_18 at formula_19 constant we get:
:formula_20
Since we know from the Gibbs potential equation that:
:formula_21

with the molar volume formula_22, these last two equations put together give:
:formula_23

Since all this, done as a pure substance, is valid in an ideal mix just adding the subscript formula_3 to all the intensive variables and changing formula_22 to formula_26, with optional overbar, standing for partial molar volume:

:formula_27

Applying the first equation of this section to this last equation we find:

:formula_28
which means that the partial molar volumes in an ideal mix are independent of composition. Consequently, the total volume is the sum of the volumes of the components in their pure forms:
:formula_29

=== Enthalpy and heat capacity ===
Proceeding in a similar way but taking the derivative with respect to formula_19 we get a similar result for molar enthalpies:
:formula_31
Remembering that formula_32 we get:
:formula_33
which in turn means that formula_34 and that the enthalpy of the mix is equal to the sum of its component enthalpies.

Since formula_35 and formula_36, similarly
:formula_37
It is also easily verifiable that 
:formula_38

=== Entropy of mixing ===
Finally since 
:formula_39
we find that 
:formula_40
Since the Gibbs free energy per mole of the mixture formula_41 is
formula_42
then
:formula_43

At last we can calculate the molar entropy of mixing since 
formula_44 and formula_45
:formula_46
:formula_47

== Consequences ==
Solvent–solute interactions are the same as solute–solute and solvent–solvent interactions, on average. Consequently, the enthalpy of mixing (solution) is zero and the change in Gibbs free energy on mixing is determined solely by the entropy of mixing. Hence the molar Gibbs free energy of mixing is
:formula_48
or for a two-component ideal solution 
:formula_49
where m denotes molar, i.e., change in Gibbs free energy per mole of solution, and formula_4 is the mole fraction of component formula_3. Note that this free energy of mixing is always negative (since each formula_52, each formula_53 or its limit for formula_54 must be negative (infinite)), i.e., &quot;ideal solutions are miscible at any composition&quot; and no phase separation will occur.

The equation above can be expressed in terms of chemical potentials of the individual components
:formula_55
where formula_56 is the change in chemical potential of formula_3 on mixing. If the chemical potential of pure liquid formula_3 is denoted formula_59, then the chemical potential of formula_3 in an ideal solution is

:formula_61

Any component formula_3 of an ideal solution obeys Raoult&#x27;s Law over the entire composition range:
:formula_63
where formula_64 is the equilibrium vapor pressure of pure component formula_3 and formula_66is the mole fraction of component formula_3 in solution.

== Non-ideality ==

Deviations from ideality can be described by the use of Margules functions or activity coefficients. A single Margules parameter may be sufficient to describe the properties of the solution if the deviations from ideality are modest; such solutions are termed &quot;regular&quot;.

In contrast to ideal solutions, where volumes are strictly additive and mixing is always complete, the volume of a non-ideal solution is not, in general, the simple sum of the volumes of the component pure liquids and solubility is not guaranteed over the whole composition range. By measurement of densities, thermodynamic activity of components can be determined.

<text>Summer Phoenix (born Summer Joy Bottom; December 10, 1978 ) is an American actress. She is the youngest sibling of actors River Phoenix, Rain Phoenix, Joaquin Phoenix, and Liberty Phoenix.

== Early life ==
Phoenix&#x27;s mother, Arlyn Sharon (née Dunetz), was born in New York, to Jewish parents of Hungarian-Jewish and Russian-Jewish descent. Her father, John Lee Bottom, was from California and has English, German, and French ancestry.

== Career ==
Phoenix was a child actor, working with agent Iris Burton along with her brothers and sister at the age of two, and went on to have guest roles in &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Growing Pains&quot; (as a not-very-close friend of Ben Seaver), &quot;Swamp&quot; &quot;Thing&quot;, and &quot;Airwolf&quot;. She appeared in the TV movie &quot;Kate&#x27;s Secret&quot; and in &quot;Russkies&quot;, playing the younger sister of real-life brother Joaquin. Phoenix later appeared in &quot;Wasted&quot;, &quot;The Laramie Project&quot;, &quot;SLC Punk!&quot;, &quot;Dinner Rush&quot;, &quot;The Believer&quot;, and &quot;The Faculty&quot;. She played leads in &quot;Esther Kahn&quot; (2000) and &quot;Suzie Gold&quot; (2004).

In 2002, Phoenix starred in a three-month run of &quot;This is Our Youth&quot; at the Garrick Theatre alongside Matt Damon and Casey Affleck. 

She was a member of the rock band The Causey Way with her sister Rain. She later made guest appearances on albums by Rain&#x27;s band, the Papercranes.

== Personal life ==
She became engaged to Casey Affleck on December 25, 2003, and gave birth to a son in Amsterdam. Phoenix and Affleck married on June 3, 2006, in Savannah, Georgia and had a second son. In March 2016, Affleck and Phoenix publicly announced they were separating, though it has been acknowledged that they separated in November 2015. Phoenix filed a petition of divorce with the Superior Court of California in Los Angeles on August 1, 2017, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences,&quot; and it was finalized that year.

In 2003, she and friends Odessa Whitmire and Ruby Canner opened the vintage clothing boutique Some Odd Rubies on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side. It closed in 2012.

Phoenix is vegan.

<doc id="731436" wikidata="Q2045021" url="?curid=731436" title="Clash cymbals">
<text>Clash cymbals (also called concert cymbals, orchestral cymbals, or crash cymbals) are cymbals played in matched pairs by holding one cymbal in each hand and striking the two together.

To differentiate this type of cymbal from a suspended cymbal, they are also called hand cymbals.

==Terminology==
In musical scores, clash cymbals are normally indicated as &quot;cymbals&quot; or sometimes simply &quot;C.C.&quot; If another type of cymbal, for example, a suspended cymbal, is required in an orchestral score, then for historical reasons this is often also indicated &quot;cymbals&quot;. Some composers and arrangers use the plural &quot;cymbals&quot; or &quot;crash cymbals&quot; to indicate clash cymbals, with the singular &quot;cymbal&quot; to indicate a suspended cymbal.

Composers will often condense the clash cymbals and a suspended cymbal into the same part. There are a number of techniques used to indicate which is desired. Whenever &quot;with stick&quot; or &quot;with mallet&quot; is written, a suspended cymbal is used. A return to clash cymbals can be specified with the Italian phrase &quot;a due&quot;. Russian composers developed a notation to differentiate between clash and suspended cymbals in which a + (plus sign) is written over a note to be played on suspended cymbal and a ° (open circle) is written over a note to be played with clash cymbals.

In foreign language scores, such types of cymbals are known as or (in Italian), (in German), and (in French).

==Technique==
===Classical music===
In an orchestral context, the cymbals are held by their straps with the thumb and index finger closest to the bell, not unlike holding a drumstick. The cymbals are held at a 45-degree angle with the dominant hand holding the cymbal over the other. To crash, there is a brief prep motion in which the arms move away from each other, before finally dropping the dominant handed cymbal on top of the bottom cymbal. Properly played crashes will be played like a flam where the bottom of the cymbals touch before meeting at the top. This is done to prevent any air pockets from occurring. 

There are several ways to hold the cymbals after the crash. Some practitioners hold the cymbals up and vertically with the inside of the cymbal facing the audience. This actually shortens the sustain as the sound is transferred up rather than out and causes the hands to be in contact with the cymbal. Other practitioners hold the cymbals parallel to the floor. This allows for the most sound to reach the audience as the sound is transferred horizontally.

===Marching arts===

In a marching ensemble, such as a drum corps or marching band, cymbals will often be marched as part of the drumline. The technique of marching cymbals is vastly different from that of orchestral cymbals. Typically, marching cymbalist employ a technique known as &quot;Garfield grip&quot; (named after its use by the Garfield Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps) in which the hand is placed through the straps and twisted to let the palm rest on top of the bell. This technique allows for greater control over the instrument and for movements known as &quot;visuals&quot; – flashy maneuvers such as flips and twirls. 

There has been a trend in recent years to replace the cymbal line with cymbals in the front ensemble, although cymbals still remain a vital instrument in indoor percussion ensembles.

===Hi-hats===

A drum kit normally contains one pair of clash cymbals mounted on a pedal-operated hi-hat stand. These are commonly far smaller and lighter than hand-operated clash cymbals, and are played with drum sticks as well as clashed together using the pedal. The hi-hat arose out of the need for vaudeville pit orchestras to combine the roles of a bass drummer, snare drummer, and cymbalist into one player, eventually forming the modern drum set.

==Sizes==
Clash cymbals come in matched pairs. They are commonly found in three weights:

*&quot;French&quot;, &quot;leggero&quot;, or &quot;light&quot;
*&quot;Viennese&quot;, &quot;medio&quot;, or &quot;medium&quot;
*&quot;Germanic&quot;, &quot;Wagnerian&quot;, or &quot;heavy&quot;

Instruments of all weights range in size from 14&quot; to 22&quot; in diameter. The smallest and thickest tend to have the higher pitch, the thinner ones allow for greater expression, and the largest have the greatest volume.

==Straps==
Orchestral clash cymbals have leather or nylon straps passed through the holes in their bells, leading to four tails which are knotted inside the bell, to allow the percussionist to hold them. Marching cymbal lines use leather pads placed on the bell to cushion the hands.

Chinese clash cymbals need no handles as the squared bells can be held quite securely without them and are often joined by a cord through the holes in their bells which allows the percussionist to release the bells after striking, producing less damping and greater sustain, and swing the cymbals producing doppler effects.

<text>Earl of Ruglen was a title in the Peerage of Scotland. Along with the subsidiary titles Viscount of Riccartoun and Lord Hillhouse, it was created on 14 April 1697, for Lord John Douglas-Hamilton, fourth (third surviving) son of William Douglas-Hamilton, Duke of Hamilton, 1st Earl of Selkirk, and his wife Anne Hamilton, 3rd Duchess of Hamilton. The 1st Earl of Ruglen succeeded as 3rd Earl of Selkirk on the death of his elder brother in 1739. The Earl&#x27;s only son William, Lord Daer, died in 1742, so on the death of the Earl of Selkirk and Ruglen in 1744, the Earldom of Selkirk passed to his great-nephew, while the Earldom of Ruglen passed to his daughter, Anne, who had married William Douglas, 2nd Earl of March. On her death in 1748, the Earldom of Ruglen passed to her only child William, 3rd Earl of March. He succeeded his first cousin once removed Charles Douglas as 5th Marquess and 4th Duke of Queensberry in 1778.

The 3rd Earl died in 1810, and the Earldom of Ruglen became extinct, while other titles passed to the late Earl&#x27;s relatives. His second cousin twice removed (Francis Douglas, 8th Earl of Wemyss) succeeded to the Earldom of March, his fourth (and also third) cousin once removed (Sir Charles Douglas, 5th Bt) succeeded to the Marquessate of Queensberry, and his second cousin once removed (Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch) succeeded to the Dukedom of Queensberry.

==Earls of Ruglen (1697) ==

*John Hamilton, 1st Earl of Ruglen, 3rd Earl of Selkirk (1664–1744)
*Anne Hamilton, 2nd Countess of Ruglen (1698–1748)
*William Douglas, 3rd Earl of March, 3rd Earl of Ruglen, 5th Marquess of Queensberry, 4th Duke of Queensberry (1725–1810)

<text>Felix Grundy (September 11, 1777 – December 19, 1840) was an American attorney and politician who served as the 13th United States Attorney General. He also had served several terms as a congressman and as a U.S. senator from Tennessee. He was known for his success as a criminal lawyer who attracted crowds when he served on the defense.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in Berkeley County, Virginia (now Berkeley County, West Virginia), Grundy moved with his parents to Brownsville, Pennsylvania, and then Kentucky with his parents. He was educated at home and at the Bardstown Academy in Bardstown, Kentucky. He read law as an apprentice with an established firm, was admitted to the Kentucky bar in 1799. That year he started practice in Springfield, Kentucky.

===Career===
In 1799, he was chosen to represent Washington County at the convention that drafted the second Kentucky Constitution. From 1800 to 1802, he represented Washington County in the Kentucky House of Representatives. He moved to Nelson County, and was elected to represent it in the Kentucky House for one term (1804–1806).

On December 10, 1806, he was commissioned an associate justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals. Grundy was elevated to Chief Justice of the court on April 11, 1807.

Later that year, he resigned and moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where he again took up the practice of law. Grundy was opposed to the rising Kentucky politician (and later founder of the Whig Party), Henry Clay, whose Bluegrass interests clashed with Grundy&#x27;s. The former chief justice left Kentucky in part because of Clay&#x27;s growing presence in the state. In addition, Nashville was growing rapidly as the chief city in the Middle District of Tennessee. While soon renowned as a criminal lawyer in Tennessee, Grundy maintained his political ambition.

Grundy was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the 12th and 13th Congresses and served from March 4, 1811, until his resignation in July 1814.

He was elected and served as a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives from 1819 to 1825. In 1820 he was a commissioner to settle the boundary line (state line) between Tennessee and Kentucky.

He was elected as a Jacksonian in 1829 to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy in the term ending March 4, 1833, caused by the resignation of John H. Eaton to join the Cabinet of President Andrew Jackson. Reelected in 1832, Grundy served from October 19, 1829, to July 4, 1838, when he resigned to accept a Cabinet position. During his period in Congress, Grundy served as chairman of the Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads (21st through 24th Congresses), U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary (24th and 25th Congresses).

Grundy was appointed as Attorney General of the United States by President Martin Van Buren in July 1838. He resigned the post in December 1839, having been elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate on November 19, 1839, to fill the vacancy in the term commencing March 4, 1839, caused by the resignation of Ephraim Foster.

He resolved the question of whether he was eligible to be elected as Senator while holding the office of Attorney General by resigning on December 14, 1839. He was reelected by the Tennessee legislature to the Senate the same day, serving from December 14, 1839, until his death in Nashville, a little over a year later. During this stint in the US Senate, Grundy served as chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Revolutionary Claims in the 26th Congress.

===Death and honors===
Grundy was buried at Nashville City Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee. After his death, four American counties were named in his honor. The four counties are located in Illinois, Iowa, Missouri and Tennessee.

Both Grundy Center, Iowa, and its location of Grundy County, Iowa are also named in his honor. Grundy Center&#x27;s annual festival, called &quot;Felix Grundy Days&quot;, are held each July. This marks the start to the annual Grundy County Fair, located in Grundy Center.

===Legacy===
Grundy was a mentor to future President James K. Polk. Polk purchased Grundy&#x27;s home in Nashville called &quot;Grundy Place&quot; and changed the name to &quot;Polk Place&quot;. He lived and died there after his presidency. It was demolished in 1901.

<text>The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh is the public library system in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Its main branch is located in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, and it has 19 branch locations throughout the city. Like hundreds of other Carnegie libraries, the construction of the main library, which opened in 1895, and several neighborhood branches, was funded by industrialist Andrew Carnegie. The Pittsburgh area houses the first branches in the United States.

The Pittsburgh Photographic Library is a photography repository held by the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh of over 50,000 prints and negatives relating to history of Pittsburgh.

== History ==
The City of Pittsburgh was originally home to eight Carnegie libraries constructed at the turn of the twentieth century. In 1881, Andrew Carnegie offered a US$250,000 grant to the city for the construction of a public library on the condition that the city provided the land and annual funding for the maintenance of the property. The city declined Carnegie&#x27;s initial offer out of concern that a publicly funded library was not a state-sanctioned use of public tax funds. With the passing of several years and the state legislature&#x27;s endorsement of the project, however, the city reconsidered the offer and reached out to Carnegie in the interest of accepting his grant.

In 1890, the City of Pittsburgh accepted an expanded grant of $1 million for the building of the main library in Oakland and five branches in the neighborhoods of Lawrenceville, West End, Wylie Avenue (Hill District), Mount Washington, and Hazelwood. While the initial plan only called for those five branches, the city later received another three Carnegie libraries in the East Liberty, South Side, and Homewood neighborhoods. Construction on the main library was finished in 1895 while the branch libraries were constructed over the following fifteen years, ending with the completion of the Homewood branch in 1910.

Six of the original Carnegie library branch locations continue to serve as public libraries in their respective neighborhoods: Lawrenceville, West End, Mount Washington, Hazelwood, South Side, and Homewood. The East Liberty branch was demolished in the 1960s as part of a redevelopment plan, and the Wylie Avenue branch was moved to a new location in 1982.

In January 2022, the 201 members of the United Library Workers (ULW), the union of library staff, which organized with United Steelworkers in 2019, ratified their first contract with the library&#x27;s management. Environmental service workers and drivers had already been unionized with the Teamsters and SEIU.

==Partnership with suburban branches==
For decades, CLP has partnered with suburban area branches, and, in 2014, talks were started seeking innovative ways to combine some services.

== Theft case ==
In 2018, the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; reported that nearly 320 rare books, maps, engravings, and other items had been stolen from the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh&#x27;s main branch in Oakland, which houses the system&#x27;s rare book collection. The items, including a 1787 document signed by Thomas Jefferson, were valued at more than $8 million. In July 2018, a former library archivist and a Pittsburgh-area bookseller were charged with the thefts, which took place over a period of two decades.

It was one of the largest rare-book theft cases in history. According to the criminal complaints detailing alleged scheme, the archivist said that he &quot;often removed items from the Oliver Room at the library&#x27;s main branch in Oakland by carrying individual plates [and] maps in manila folders, or for books or larger items, by brazenly rolling them up and walking out.&quot; The archivist is alleged to have turned the rare items over to the bookseller, who would then sell them through his store.

<doc id="731463" wikidata="Q1088099" url="?curid=731463" title="Law of the sea">
<text>Law of the sea (or ocean law) is a body of international law governing the rights and duties of states in maritime environments. It concerns matters such as navigational rights, sea mineral claims, and coastal waters jurisdiction. The connotation of &quot;ocean law&quot; is somewhat broader, but the law of the sea (anchored in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)) is so comprehensive that it covers all areas of ocean law as well (e.g., marine environmental law, maritime law).

While drawn from a number of international customs, treaties, and agreements, modern law of the sea derives largely from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. That convention is effective since 1994, and is generally accepted as a codification of customary international law of the sea, and is sometimes regarded as the &quot;constitution of the oceans&quot;.

Law of the sea is the public law counterpart to admiralty law (also known as maritime law), which applies to private maritime issues, such as the carriage of goods by sea, rights of salvage, ship collisions, and marine insurance.

== History ==
Among the earliest examples of legal codes concerning maritime affairs is the Byzantine &quot;Lex Rhodia,&quot; promulgated between 600 and 800 C.E. to govern trade and navigation in the Mediterranean. Maritime law codes were also created during the European Middle Ages, such as the Rolls of Oléron, which drew from &quot;Lex Rhodia&quot;, and the Laws of Wisby, enacted among the mercantile city-states of the Hanseatic League.

However, the earliest known formulation of &quot;public&quot; international law of the sea was in 17th century Europe, which saw unprecedented navigation, exploration, and trade across the world&#x27;s oceans. Portugal and Spain led this trend, staking claims over both the land and sea routes they discovered. Spain considered the Pacific Ocean a &quot;mare clausum—&quot;literally a &quot;closed sea&quot; off limits to other naval powers—in part to protect its possessions in Asia. Similarly, as the only known entrance from the Atlantic, the Strait of Magellan was periodically patrolled by Spanish fleets to prevent entrance by foreign vessels. The papal bull &quot;Romanus Pontifex&quot; (1455) recognized Portugal&#x27;s exclusive right to navigation, trade, and fishing in the seas near discovered land, and on this basis the Portuguese claimed a monopoly on East Indian trade, prompting opposition and conflict from other European naval powers.

Amid growing competition over sea trade, Dutch jurist and philosopher Hugo Grotius—considered the father of international law generally—wrote &quot;Mare Liberum&quot; (&quot;The Freedom of the Seas&quot;), published in 1609, which set forth the principle that the sea was international territory and that all nations were thus free to use it for trade. He premised this argument on the idea that &quot;every nation is free to travel to every other nation, and to trade with it.&quot; Thus, there was a right to innocent passage over land and a similar right of innocent passage at sea. Grotius observed that unlike land, on which sovereigns could demarcate their jurisdiction, the sea was akin to air, a common property of all:

Writing in response to Grotius, the English jurist John Selden argued in &quot;Mare Clausum&quot; that the sea was as capable of appropriation by sovereign powers as terrestrial territory. Rejecting Grotius&#x27; premise, Selden claimed there was no historical basis for the sea to be treated differently than land, nor was there anything inherent in the nature of the sea that precluded states from exercising dominion over parts of it. In essence, international law could evolve to accommodate the emerging framework of national jurisdiction over the sea.
As a growing number of nations began to expand their naval presence across the world, conflicting claims over the open sea mounted. This prompted maritime states to moderate their stance and to limit the extent of their jurisdiction towards the sea from land. This was aided by the compromise position presented by Dutch legal theorist Cornelius Bynkershoek, who in &quot;De dominio maris&quot; (1702), established the principle that maritime dominion was limited to the distance within which cannons could effectively protect it.

Grotius&#x27; concept of &quot;freedom of the seas&quot; became virtually universal through the 20th century, following the global dominance of European naval powers. National rights and jurisdiction over the seas were limited to a specified belt of water extending from a nation&#x27;s coastlines, usually three nautical miles (5.6 km), according to Bynkershoek&#x27;s &quot;cannon shot&quot; rule. Under the &quot;mare liberum&quot; principle, all waters beyond national boundaries were considered international waters: Free to all nations, but belonging to none of them.

In the early 20th century, some nations expressed their desire to extend national maritime claims, namely to exploit mineral resources, protect fish stocks, and enforce pollution controls. To that end, in 1930, the League of Nations called conference at The Hague, but no agreements resulted. By the mid 20th century, technological improvements in fishing and oil exploration expanded the nautical range in which countries could detect and exploit natural resources. This prompted United States President Harry S. Truman in 1945 to extend American jurisdiction to all the natural resources of its continental shelf, well beyond the territorial waters of the country. Truman&#x27;s proclamation cited the customary international law principle of a nation&#x27;s right to protect its natural resources. Other nations quickly followed suit: Between 1946 and 1950, Chile, Peru, and Ecuador extended their rights to a distance of 200 nautical miles (370 km) to cover their Humboldt Current fishing grounds.

=== UN Convention of the Law of the Sea ===

The first attempt to promulgate and codify a comprehensive law of the sea was in the 1950s, shortly after the Truman proclamation on the continental shelf. In 1956, the United Nations held its first Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS I) in Geneva, Switzerland, which resulted in four treaties concluded in 1958:

* Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone, entry into force: 10 September 1964
* Convention on the Continental Shelf, entry into force: 10 June 1964
* Convention on the High Seas, entry into force: 30 September 1962
* Convention on Fishing and Conservation of Living Resources of the High Seas, entry into force: 20 March 1966

The Convention on the Continental Shelf effectively codified Truman&#x27;s proclamation as customary international law. While UNCLOS I was widely considered a success, it left open the important issue of the extent of territorial waters. In 1960, the UN held a second Conference on the Law of the Sea (&quot;UNCLOS II&quot;), but this did not result in any new agreements. The pressing issue of varying claims of territorial waters was raised at the UN in 1967 by Malta, prompting in 1973 a third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea in New York City. In an attempt to reduce the possibility of groups of nation-states dominating the negotiations, the conference used a consensus process rather than majority vote. With more than 160 nations participating, the conference lasted until 1982, resulting in the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea, also known as the Law of the Sea Treaty, which defines the rights and responsibilities of nations in their use of the world&#x27;s oceans.

UNCLOS introduced a number of provisions, of which the most significant concerned navigation, archipelagic status and transit regimes, exclusive economic zones (EEZs), continental shelf jurisdiction, deep seabed mining, the exploitation regime, protection of the marine environment, scientific research, and settlement of disputes. It also set the limit of various areas, measured from a carefully defined sea baseline.

The convention also codified freedom of the sea, explicitly providing that the oceans are open to all states, with no state being able to subject any part to its sovereignty. Consequently, state parties cannot unilaterally extend their sovereignty beyond their EEZ, the 200 nautical miles in which that state has exclusive rights to fisheries, minerals, and sea-floor deposits. &quot;Innocent passage&quot; is permitted through both territorial waters and the EEZ, even by military vessels, provided they do no harm to the country or break any of its laws.

The convention came into force on 16 November 1994, one year after it was ratified by the 60th state, Guyana; the four treaties concluded in the first UN Conference in 1956 were consequently superseded. As of June 2019, UNCLOS has been ratified by 168 states. Many of the countries that have not ratified the treaty, such as the U.S., nonetheless recognize its provisions as reflective of international customary law. Thus, it remains the most widely recognized and followed source of international law with respect to the sea.

Between 2018 and 2020, there is a conference on a possible change to the law of the sea regarding conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (General Assembly resolution 72/249).

== Recognition and enforcement of law of the sea ==
Although UNCLOS was created under the auspices of the UN, the organization has no direct operational role in its implementation. However, a specialized agency of the UN, the International Maritime Organization, plays a role in monitoring and enforcing certain provisions of the convention, along with the intergovernmental International Seabed Authority (ISA), which was established by the convention to organize, regulate and control all mineral-related activities in the international seabed area beyond territorial limits. UNCLOS established the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), based in Hamburg, Germany, to adjudicate all disputes concerning the interpretation or application of the convention (subject to the provisions of Article 297 and to the declarations made in accordance with article 298 of the convention). Its 21 judges are drawn from a wide variety of nations. Because the EEZ is so extensive, many ITLOS cases concern competing claims over the ocean boundaries between states As of 2017, ITLOS had settled 25 cases.

Other types of intergovernental organizations enforcing the law of the sea include UN FAO regional fishery bodies and arrangements, as well as UNEP regional seas conventions and action plans.

==Maritime law==
Law of the sea should be distinguished from maritime law, which concerns maritime issues and disputes among private parties, such as individuals, international organizations, or corporations. However, the International Maritime Organisation, a UN agency that plays a major role in implementing law of the sea, also helps to develop, codify, and regulate certain rules and standards of maritime law.

She made her comeback in May 2008 in a special episode, reconciling with Kapoor. In November 2008, Kyunki came to an end, leading to Irani&#x27;s decline on TV.

==Political career==

Irani joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in 2003. The following year, she was appointed vice-president of the Maharashtra Youth Wing in 2004. In the general elections held that year for the 14th Lok Sabha, she contested unsuccessfully against Kapil Sibal from the Chandni Chowk constituency in Delhi. That election witnessed a shock defeat for the incumbent Vajpayee government. In December 2004, Irani, blaming then Gujarat Chief Minister, Narendra Modi for BJP&#x27;s electoral losses, threatened to fast unto death until he resigned. She retracted this demand after the BJP&#x27;s central leadership threatened to take action against her.

Irani was nominated as executive member of the central committee of the BJP. During the campaign for the 2009 parliamentary elections, while campaigning for Vijay Goel in the New Delhi constituency, Irani voiced her concern for women&#x27;s safety in the city and advocated capital punishment for rapists as a deterrent. In early 2010, Irani was appointed National Secretary of BJP and on 24 June, she was appointed All India President of the BJP&#x27;s women&#x27;s wing, BJP Mahila Morcha.

Irani contested the 2014 general elections against Rahul Gandhi in Amethi constituency of Uttar Pradesh. Irani lost to Gandhi by 1,07,923 votes, a 12.32% margin. On 26 May 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appointed her as the Minister of Human Resource Development in his cabinet. Her appointment was criticised by many people owing to her lack of formal higher education.

Irani has been accused of misrepresenting her educational qualifications. Conflicting affidavits were allegedly submitted by her while filing for different elections. In June 2015, a lower court held that the allegations against Irani were maintainable and a delay in prosecution was not a valid reason for dismissal. Irani asked people to file a PIL about her educational qualification to know about the truth behind the affidavit controversy.

Irani implemented various reforms in universities during her term as HRD minister. Irani made a speech in Parliament in which she discussed the 2016 JNU sedition controversy and the Suicide of Rohith Vemula.

==Events==
=== Undergraduate degree ===
Irani was accused of providing contradictory affidavits about her educational qualifications during different elections. In her affidavit for the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, she reportedly stated her educational qualification as B.A. from Delhi University. However, while filing affidavits in her nomination papers for Rajya Sabha from Gujarat in 2011 and Lok Sabha from Uttar Pradesh in 2014, she said her highest educational qualification was, B.com, Part 1 from School of Open Learning at University of Delhi.

She later claimed that she has done B.com, Part 1 from Delhi University (not completing the full course till Part 3) in the affidavit she filed for Rajya Sabha elections from Gujarat in 2017 which stated &quot;Bachelor of Commerce, Part 1. Three year degree course not completed&quot;.

A freelance writer Ahmer Khan filed a complaint in April 2015 that Smriti Irani had filed an affidavit in April 2004 for the Lok Sabha elections, stating that she had completed her Bachelor of Arts in 1996 from School of Correspondence (Delhi University) but in another affidavit of 16 April 2014, filed by her for the Lok Sabha polls, it was said that she was a Bachelor of Commerce Part-I from the School of Open Learning (Delhi University). The plea said that the facts and circumstances reveal commission of offences by Smriti under section 125A (which deals with penalty of filing false affidavit and entails a jail term) of the Representation of People Act, 1951.

The court had on 20 November 2016 allowed the complainant&#x27;s plea seeking direction to the officials of EC and DU to bring the records of Ms. Irani&#x27;s qualifications after he said he was unable to place them before the court. During the hearings of the complaint, the court was told by a poll panel official that the documents filed by Ms. Irani regarding her educational qualification while filing nominations were not traceable. Also, in pursuance of the court&#x27;s earlier direction, Delhi University had also submitted that the documents pertaining to Ms. Irani&#x27;s BA course in 1996, as purportedly mentioned by her in an affidavit filed during 2004 Lok Sabha elections, were yet to be found.

On 18 October 2016, a Delhi court said that Smriti Irani will not be summoned for the fake degree case because the petition filed against Irani questioning her college degrees was an attempt to harass her. The court said that the complainant may not have filed it if she were not a central minister. Metropolitan Magistrate Harvinder Singh said that original evidence had already been lost due to the passage of years, secondary evidence wasn&#x27;t enough for court. The Magistrate also said that the complainant made a &quot;delay of 11 years&quot; in filing the complaint against Irani. This verdict of the lower court was challenged in the Delhi High Court and the court asked all the records of the case to be handed over to it in order to examine case records before deciding to summon Irani or anyone else.

===Trivialising Child Abuse===
In December 2021, while at the same time holding a portfolio of Union Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani posted an image on Instagram which read, &quot;When I was a kid, they didn&#x27;t take me to a psychologist... My mom was able to open my chakra, stabilize my karma and clean my aura with one single slap.&quot; She was widely criticised for trivialising the widely prevalent issue of child abuse in Indian households with her post and degrading the role of mental health experts.

===Silly Souls Cafe ===
In July 2022, a website by the name of Herald Goa published a story on an RTI response received by lawyer Aires Rodrigues alleging that the liquor licence of Silly Souls Cafe and Bar had been renewed illegally and that Smriti Irani&#x27;s family is connected with the bar. In an earlier interview on a food critic&#x27;s YouTube channel, Smriti Irani&#x27;s daughter agreed that the bar is owned by her. In an affidavit in Delhi High Court, Smriti Irani denied any connection of her family with the bar. Later an RTI reply revealed that the licence was issued in the name of a company linked with Irani&#x27;s family. Earlier RTI filings show that the Irani family&#x27;s company and the bar has the same address and identical GST number, and that the Irani family&#x27;s company&#x27;s operation includes liquor sales, which requires licence according to law.

<doc id="731499" wikidata="Q3316923" url="?curid=731499" title="Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission">
<text>The Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission (also called the MSSC or Sov-Com) was a state agency in Mississippi active from 1956 to 1973 and tasked with fighting integration and controlling civil rights activism. It was overseen by the Governor of Mississippi. The stated objective of the commission was to &quot;[...] protect the sovereignty of the state of Mississippi, and her sister states&quot; from &quot;encroachment thereon by the Federal Government&quot;. It coordinated activities to portray the state and racial segregation in a more positive light. Serving governors and lieutenant governors of Mississippi were &quot;ex officio&quot; members of the commission. The Sovereignty Commission spied on and conspired against civil rights activists and organized pressure and economic retaliation against those who supported the civil rights movement in Mississippi.

The agency was given unusual authority to investigate citizens of the state, issue subpoenas and even exercise police powers, although it was not attached to any law enforcement agency. During its existence, the commission profiled more than 87,000 persons associated with, or suspected to be associated with, the civil rights movement (which it opposed). It investigated the work and credit histories and even personal relations of persons it investigated. It collaborated with local white officials of government, police, and business to pressure African Americans to give up activism, especially by economic pressures, such as causing them to be fired, evicted from rental housing, or to have their businesses boycotted.

==Creation==

After James P. Coleman won Mississippi&#x27;s gubernatorial election in 1955, he proposed to the Legal Educational Advisory Committee the creation of &quot;a permanent authority for maintenance of racial segregation with a full staff and funds for its operations to come out of tax money.&quot; After Coleman took office, the Mississippi House of Representatives proposed House Bill 880, which would create a State Sovereignty Commission. While most legislators and the local media were supportive of the bill, some representatives were skeptical of its power to give funds to private entities, fearing that the body would essentially become a partner of Citizens&#x27; Councils, civic groups organized to block desegregation. The House passed the bill over these legislators&#x27; objections, though the Mississippi State Senate added an amendment to the measure authorizing the Mississippi State Auditor to review the commission&#x27;s expenditures. The amended bill was then passed by the House with 107 votes in support and 33 abstentions/absences. Coleman signed it into law on March 30, 1956.

== Structure ==

Itself an agency in the executive branch of Mississippi&#x27;s state government, the State Sovereignty Commission comprised three divisions: executive, public relations, and investigative. The commission was led by a board of twelve members, who determined policy and reviewed its work. It comprised some &quot;ex officio&quot; members: the governor, lieutenant governor, the Speaker of the Mississippi House of Representatives, and the state attorney general; three members of the House, two members of the Senate, and three others appointed by the governor who served during the governor&#x27;s term. The governor sat as the chairman of the board and appointed the agency director with the board&#x27;s approval. The lieutenant governor served as the board&#x27;s vice-chairman. The commission maintained its offices in the Mississippi State Capitol and retained three secretaries as support staff.

Public relations was originally the main focus of the organization, and from 1956 until 1963 the commission retained a separate director of public relations. The mission crafted for the relations division tasked it with countering negative media attention and perceptions about race relations and segregation in Mississippi. Its investigative division never had more than three full-time investigators, but the commission would sometimes employ part-time investigators or contract work out to private entities. Their job was to &quot;obtain facts which will be of value in protecting the sovereignty of this State and preserving segregation in Mississippi.&quot; The Sovereignty Commission&#x27;s first investigator was Leonard Hicks, who began his position in 1956. In 1958 Zack Van Landingham became an investigator, followed by R.C. &quot;Bob&quot; Thomas, State Representative Hugh Boren, Andy Hopkins, and Tom Scarbrough in 1960. Landingham was a former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, and modeled the commission&#x27;s filing system after the one used by the federal agency. Other principal investigators for the Sovereignty Commission were Virgil Downing, Leland Cole, Fulton Tutor, Edgar C. Fortenberry, and James &quot;Mack&quot; Mohead. Many had worked in law enforcement agencies. Their duties included special assignments from the commission director, but they also carried out routine analyses of racial incidents in the state. They frequently relied upon informants, who were sometimes compensated for their expenses or regularly as much as $500 a month.

The Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission served as an organizational template for creation of the Louisiana State Sovereignty Commission (1960–1970), and the Alabama State Sovereignty Commission (1963–1973).

==Activities==
=== Overview ===
As the state&#x27;s public relations campaign failed to dampen rising civil rights activism, the commission put people to work as a &quot;de facto&quot; intelligence organization, trying to identify citizens who might be supporting civil rights initiatives, be allied with communists, or whose associations, activities, and travels did not seem to conform to segregationist norms. Swept up on lists of people under suspicion by such broad criteria were tens of thousands of African-American and white professionals, teachers, and government workers in agricultural and other agencies, churches, and community organizations. The &quot;commission penetrated most of the major civil rights organizations in Mississippi, even planting clerical workers in the offices of activist attorneys. It informed police about planned marches or boycotts and encouraged police harassment of African-Americans who cooperated with civil rights groups. Its agents obstructed voter registration by blacks and harassed African-Americans seeking to attend white schools.&quot;

The commission&#x27;s activities included attempting to preserve the state&#x27;s segregation and Jim Crow laws, opposing school integration, and ensuring portrayal of the state &quot;in a positive light.&quot; Among its first employees were a former FBI agent and a transfer from the state highway patrol. &quot;The agency outwardly extolled racial harmony, but it secretly paid investigators and spies to gather both information and misinformation.&quot; Staff of the commission worked closely with, and in some cases funded, the notorious White Citizens&#x27; Councils. From 1960 to 1964, the commission secretly funded the White Citizens Council, a private organization, with $190,000 of state funds.

The commission also used its intelligence-gathering capabilities to assist in the defense of Byron De La Beckwith, the murderer of Medgar Evers in 1963, during his second trial in 1964. Sov-Com investigator Andy Hopkins provided De La Beckwith&#x27;s attorneys with information on the potential jurors, which the attorneys used during the selection process.

In 1964, the Sov-Com passed on information regarding civil rights workers James Chaney, Michael Schwerner, and Andrew Goodman, to the conspirators in their murders during Freedom Summer. Commission agent A.L. Hopkins met with Neshoba County law enforcement and suggested the disappearance of the three young men was a propaganda ploy.

=== Coleman administration ===
During Governor Coleman&#x27;s tenure, the commission was primarily deployed as a public relations agency, seeking to control activities and events which were thought to suggest that Mississippi&#x27;s race relations were poor or that its citizens broke the law. He also forbade the commission from giving funds to Citizens&#x27; Councils.

=== Barnett administration ===
Ross Barnett served as governor of Mississippi from 1960 to 1964. During his tenure the commission enlarged its investigative operations, sending agents across the state to report on civil rights activities. It also surveyed literature and libraries and collected information on persons viewed to be expressing liberal ideas or violating traditional racial mores. During this time the commission also channeled money to Citizens&#x27; Councils.

=== Johnson administration ===
Paul B. Johnson Jr. served as governor of Mississippi from 1964 to 1968. During his tenure, the agency director, Erle Johnston, owner of &quot;The Scott County Times&quot;, expanded the public relations role. He tried to form closer ties with business while monitoring proclaimed subversive groups, such as the Congress of Racial Equality, founded by James Farmer. Johnson, for his part, largely ignored the commission during his first two years as governor and did not convene any meetings of its leadership. After a requirement was attached to a state appropriations bill in June 1966 that the commission formally convene before receiving any money, the agency&#x27;s leadership met on August 8, formally adopting a policy declaring the commission as a &quot;watch dog over subversive individuals and organizations that advocate civil disobedience; as a public relations agency for the state; and as an advisor for local communities on problems resulting from federal laws or court orders.&quot; During Johnson&#x27;s tenure the commission continued to monitor individuals and groups who challenged racial norms and provided advice to other government officials on ways to work around the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

=== Williams administration ===
John Bell Williams served as governor of Mississippi from 1968 to 1972. He paid more direct attention to the commission than his predecessor, regularly convening meetings of its members and typically attending them in person. Williams placed emphasis on the agency&#x27;s investigative activities, appointing a former FBI agent, W. Webb Burke, as its director in September 1968 but neglecting to fill the public relations director role. In a 1971 internal report, Burke omitted any mention of public relations but summarized the commission&#x27;s activities as &quot;conducting investigations into matters of interest to the public and which matters pertain to tax supported institutions.&quot; During this time the commission followed up on requests from local officials to investigate civil rights-related activities and examined drug use and disruptions on university campuses.

==Demise and legacy==
=== Closure of the commission ===
In the 1971 state elections, Bill Waller was elected governor and William F. Winter—a former legislator who had opposed the commission&#x27;s creation—was elected lieutenant governor. At the time they took office, the commission was conducting little business. Both men demurred on making their allotted appointments to the commission and avoided attending its monthly meetings, sending representatives in their stead. After the legislature approved funding for the commission to continue in 1973, Waller vetoed the appropriation. Winter attended the commission&#x27;s last meeting in June to acknowledge the suspension of funding, and the commission was effectively shut down on June 30. 

Six file cabinets containing the body&#x27;s records were placed in the custody of the Mississippi Secretary of State and then stowed in the underground vault of the Vital Records Center in Flora. In January 1977 a bill was introduced in the Mississippi Legislature to abolish the commission and dispose of its assets. After intense debate over what to do about the agency&#x27;s records, the legislature decided to have them sealed at the Mississippi Department of Archives and History until July 1, 2027. Governor Cliff Finch signed the bill into law on March 4, and that day the secretary of state&#x27;s office handed the files over to the Department of Archives and History, comprising the filing cabinets, two cardboard boxes of financial records, a meeting minute book, and two loose manila folders. Several days later a package of other records kept in the governor&#x27;s office was handed over to the archives. The department locked all the relevant records in its vault.

=== Records releases ===
The year the commission&#x27;s records were sealed, the Mississippi chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union filed a class-action lawsuit against the state, arguing that it should release the files, as they were compiled from illegal surveillance of citizens. In 1998, United States District Court Judge William H. Barbour Jr. ordered all commission records not involved in litigation to be unsealed, and the majority of records were made available by March 17. After subsequent court orders, the Department of Archives and History released more files on July 31, 2000 and January 18, 2001. In 2002, the department made all of the commission&#x27;s records accessible on its website.

Once unsealed, the records revealed more than 87,000 names of citizens about whom the state had collected information, or classified as &quot;suspects&quot;. Today, the records of the commission are available online for search. The records also revealed the state&#x27;s complicity in the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner at Philadelphia, Mississippi. Its investigator A. L. Hopkins gave information about the workers to the commission, including the car license number of a new civil rights worker. It passed the information to the Sheriff of Neshoba County, who was implicated in the murders.

The Exploits River (Mi&#x27;kmaq: Sple&#x27;tk; Tenenigeg) is a river in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. It flows through the Exploits Valley in the central part of Newfoundland.

Including the Lloyds River, which discharges in Beothuk Lake, the Exploits river has a length of 246 km, making it the longest river on the island draining an area of 1,100 km2 and is the second longest in the province after the Churchill River.

The river drains Beothuk Lake at its source and discharges into the Bay of Exploits near the port town of Botwood.

The Exploits River provides habitat for spawning Atlantic Salmon and other species of fish. The salmon population increased dramatically when fish ladders were installed, opening up sections of the river that had been previously inaccessible.

<text>Deep Cover is a 1992 American crime thriller film directed by Bill Duke from a screenplay by Henry Bean and Michael Tolkin. The film stars Laurence Fishburne, Jeff Goldblum, and Charles Martin Smith. Its plot focuses on a Cincinnati-based police officer who goes undercover in a Los Angeles sting operation to bring down a West Coast drug cartel.

&quot;Deep Cover&quot; was released in the United States on April 15, 1992, by New Line Cinema. The film received positive reviews, being likened by some critics to a modern film noir. It is also notable for its theme song of the same title, composed by Dr. Dre and released as his debut solo single, which also features then-newcomer Snoop Doggy Dogg making his studio debut.

==Plot==
In 1972, Russell Stevens Jr. witnesses his drug-addicted, alcoholic father getting shot and killed while robbing a liquor store. Traumatized by his father&#x27;s death, Stevens swears that he will never end up like him.

Nineteen years later, Stevens is a Cincinnati police officer. He is recruited by DEA Special Agent Gerald Carver to go undercover in Los Angeles, claiming that his criminal-like character traits will serve him better in this capacity than they would as a uniformed cop. Stevens poses as drug dealer &quot;John Hull&quot; in order to infiltrate and work his way up the network of the West Coast&#x27;s largest drug importer, Anton Gallegos, and his uncle Hector Guzmán, a South American politician. Stevens relocates to a cheap hotel and begins dealing cocaine.

One day, Stevens is arrested by the devoutly religious LAPD Narcotics Detective Taft and his corrupt partner, Hernández, as he buys a kilogram in a set-up by Eddie Dudley, Gallegos&#x27; low-level street supplier. At his arraignment, Stevens discovers that he bought baby laxative instead of cocaine and his case is dismissed. His self-appointed attorney David Jason, who is also a drug trafficker in Gallegos&#x27; network, rewards Stevens&#x27; silence with more cocaine and introduces him to Felix Barbosa, the underboss to Gallegos. Felix kills Eddie when he finds out he&#x27;s working with the LAPD and enlists Stevens as his replacement.

Stevens develops a romance with Betty McCutcheon, the manager of an art dealership which is a front to launder Jason&#x27;s drug money. When one of Stevens&#x27; dealers is murdered by a rival dealer, he is informed by Jason that if he doesn&#x27;t retaliate, other street dealers will view it as a sign of weakness and in turn murder him. Stevens follows the rival dealer to a nightclub, corners him in a bathroom and kills him. Jason then partners with Stevens in his new business: distribution of a synthetic chemical variant of cocaine.

It is revealed that Barbosa is a confidential informant working with Hernández. After a falling out, Jason becomes more sadistic, and Stevens correctly deduces that Barbosa wants Jason killed to eliminate his competition. Felix immediately gives up Stevens, Jason and Betty to Hernández, and wants Jason killed during the arrest. Carver knows about this but refuses to interfere, forcing Stevens to violate orders and stop the murder himself by exposing Felix, which results in a vengeful Jason killing him. The killing results in Betty reneging on the drug business, with Stevens&#x27; protection.

Gallegos comes to meet with Stevens and Jason, informing them that they have inherited Felix&#x27;s debts to him. Later that day, Stevens meets with Carver to tell him about his meeting with Gallegos. Instead, Carver pulls a gun on Stevens and orders him to surrender his weapon and get in his car. Angrily, Stevens disarms Carver and forces him to admit that the State Department has decided to leave Gallegos alone because Guzmán may someday be useful as a political asset to them; Carver has decided to play along in exchange for career advancement. Disillusioned, Stevens abandons his undercover status and vows to take down Gallegos and Guzmán alone.

Stevens and Jason learn that Gallegos is going to kill them anyway, so they kill him first and steal a van storing over $100 million in cash. They then invite Guzmán to a shipyard and offer to return 80% of Gallegos&#x27; money if he agrees to invest the remaining 20% in their synthetic cocaine operation. Taft, who has been tailing Stevens, interrupts the deal and has his gun taken by Guzmán’s men. Since he is unable to arrest Guzmán because of his diplomatic immunity, Guzmán leaves.

Taft orders Stevens to surrender but is shot by Jason after attempting to brandish his backup weapon, forcing Stevens to reveal himself as a police officer as he tries to radio in for an ambulance to help Taft. Stevens tries to reason with Jason as the latter tries to convince him to just take the money and go rogue. Jason shoots Taft in the chest, killing him. Throwing all reason out of the window and seeing no other alternative, Stevens attempts to arrest Jason. When Jason shoots at him, a tearful Stevens returns fire and kills Jason in self-defense as the cops arrive.

Afterward, Carver coerces Stevens into testifying in favor of him and the DEA in return for not charging Betty with money laundering. He produces a videotape of the incriminating conversation with Guzmán at the shipyard during his testimony to the House Judiciary Subcommittee, ruining the State Department&#x27;s intentions along with Guzmán and Carver&#x27;s careers. Later, he contemplates what to do with the $11 million of Gallegos&#x27; money he secretly kept.

==Reception==
&quot;Deep Cover&quot; was released on April 17, 1992 in 901 theaters, and grossed $3.4 million on its opening weekend. It went on to make $16.6 million in North America.

The majority of critics responded favorably towards &quot;Deep Cover&quot;. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and praised the voice-over narration as &quot;poetic and colorful. That&#x27;s part of the process elevating the story from the mundane to the mythic&quot;. Janet Maslin, in her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, praised the &quot;quietly commanding Larry Fishburne and the wry Jeff Goldblum, who make an interestingly offbeat team&quot;. In his review for &quot;The Chicago Reader&quot;, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote, &quot;What emerges is a powerhouse thriller full of surprises, original touches, and rare political lucidity&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Peter Travers wrote, &quot;Duke (&quot;A Rage in Harlem&quot;) makes the perks of the drug lifestyle palpably seductive. But this time there&#x27;s something new in the snortscrew-slay formula: a working conscience&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;B−&quot; rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, &quot;The movie peels away every layer of hope, revealing a red-hot core of nihilistic despair. Fishburne, with his hair-trigger line readings and deadly reptilian gaze, conveys the controlled desperation of someone watching his own faith unravel. And Goldblum reveals a new dimension of comic rottishness&quot;. In her review for &quot;The Independent&quot;, Sheila Johnston wrote: &quot;The disappointment of &quot;Night and the City&quot; has left some critics lamenting that film noir is dead in the water, but &quot;Deep Cover&quot; displays many hallmarks of the genre, down to the diffuse paranoia (perhaps the entire operation is a high-level Washington cover-up). It was the most unexpected pleasure to arrive here in many a month&quot;. In its 2021 retrospective, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Ignatiy Vishnevetsky wrote &quot;As a depiction of crime, law enforcement, and drug dealing, the film is a cartoon; as an exploration of the Man&#x27;s ulterior motives, it&#x27;s trenchant and angry. Stylistic and attitudinal cues come by way of Miami Vice, anti-heroic Blaxploitation, and the politicized, independent-minded B-films of Samuel Fuller.&quot;

However, not all critics liked the movie. In his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Desson Howe wrote, &quot;With &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot;, Fishburne broke through to the big time. Here, his acting career takes a step backwards&quot;. Despite this, of Jeff Goldblum he stated that &quot;Oddly enough, Goldblum&#x27;s so wildly out of place in this misbegotten movie, he becomes its greatest asset&quot;. Richard Harrington, also of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, gave a mixed review, saying: &quot;While Fishburne is generally riveting -- his facial disguise is basically hardness layered onto strength -- and Goldblum is intriguing -- his wannabe urges are quite curious -- the film itself is only occasionally visceral. On the one hand, it&#x27;s refreshing and commendable that a major film casts a black actor not only as a detective (rather than as a criminal), but in the lead role.&quot;

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 87% from 31 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Deep Cover&quot; rises above standard-issue crime thriller fare thanks to a smartly cynical script and powerhouse performances from its unorthodox but well-matched leads.&quot; Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average to critics&#x27; reviews, gave the film an average score of 67 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s soundtrack, &quot;Deep Cover&quot;, was released by SOLAR Records and Epic Records on April 4, 1992. The album&#x27;s title track introduced Snoop Doggy Dogg as a recording artist, who featured alongside Dr. Dre on the song. The album, containing a mix of hip-hop, reggae and R&amp;B tracks, peaked at No. 166 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 9 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums.

==Home media==
Deep Cover made its home media debut via VHS on November 4, 1992. The DVD debuted on September 14, 1999 in a barebones snapper case with Dolby Digital 5.1 and 2.0 tracks for audio. 
The film was then released on Blu-ray Disc for the first time by the Criterion Collection on July 13, 2021, featuring a new 4K digitally restored transfer and lossless DTS HD MA 2.0 audio.

<text>Nick.com is a website owned and developed by Nickelodeon. The website now serves as an online portal for Nickelodeon content, and offered online games, video streaming, radio streaming and individual websites for each show it broadcasts. It previously promoted the Nick mobile app which replaced it (websites for its sister networks aren&#x27;t affected). Nick.com has received positive critical reaction and various awards, including a Webby in 2003. Positive praise has also been received because of the steps taken by the website to protect user privacy. Visits to the domain outside the United States are redirected to YTV in Canada, Nick.de (the website’s German version) in Germany or to the domestic network site of the visiting IP&#x27;s nation or region due to programming licensing issues between territories.

==History==
Nickelodeon launched their first online component as part of the America Online Kids Only channel in October 1995. Within a few years, a regular World Wide Web site came online, and became a strong promotional tool for Nickelodeon. The website&#x27;s popularity grew and in March 1999, Nick.com became the highest rated website for children aged six to fourteen years old. Nickelodeon used the website in conjunction with television programmes which increased traffic. Nick.com also maintained a high level of respect for user privacy during the growth of the website.

Before 2000, Nick.com&#x27;s design was mainly images and image maps allowing navigation through the website. Then, in June 2000, the website was expanded and redesigned with Flash-animated buttons and advertisements. Nick.com&#x27;s design has changed repeatedly since then, with the website&#x27;s current design making use of sidebars, web banners, and Adobe Flash.

In January 2000, developers started discussing expansion of Nick.com to make it an even more desirable website for children to visit. Mike Skagerlind, the website&#x27;s general manager at the time said &quot;But we felt strongly that it could be a lot more. We basically wanted it to be the main place that kids go to on the Web.&quot; On June 4, 2000, the website redesign began. The interface was revamped and to make it more appealing to children and the most significant development was the use of Flash for animated graphics and buttons.

On September 28, 2009, Nickelodeon revamped the site with the institution of the new logo.

In July 2014, Nickelodeon completely redesigned the site to match up with the Nickelodeon app. It did not affect its sister channels&#x27; websites.

In order to comply more with COPPA, Nickelodeon removed the ability to create an account on March 31, 2016. The message boards were closed the same day.

In December 2018, access via desktop computer to most sections of the site became limited, as links to watch episodes and play games on the site currently all redirect to a page asking viewers to download the network&#x27;s mobile and tablet apps (both the network&#x27;s app, along with separate game apps) for access to games and programming instead. As of December 2018, Nick.com no longer makes online games. This is likely due to Google Chrome&#x27;s changes that made access to Adobe Flash (which the site was built on for years) difficult to non-existent in line with Flash&#x27;s phase-out during the end of 2020, requiring a large-scale rebuild of the desktop site that cannot be done behind the scenes. It is possible that access to programming and games for desktop visitors could be restored in some point in the near future, with all elements having full compatibility with HTML5 standards. Production and distribution for Nickelodeon online games continued internationally until 2021. As of September 2022, the last known Nickelodeon web game made is titled &#x27;The Great Nickelodeon Escape&#x27;.

On December 17, 2020, the ability to watch full episodes on Nick.com was brought back, though this is exclusive to U.S. pay-TV subscribers, and one must sign in to their TV provider to watch.

On August 31, 2022, Nickelodeon brought back access to online games on Nick.com after nearly four years, replacing all advertisements for mobile apps on the games section of the website. As of September 4, 2022, there are currently ten games now available on Nick.com, including &#x27;Nickelodeon Lanes&#x27;, a bowling game made in 2021, but which has never been officially released in the USA until this change to the website.

The website was remodeled in 2023 with updated looks with the new 2023 logo change.

On July 29, 2024, Nickjr.com was closed down in order for a remodel of the main nick.com website, with Nick Jr. becoming a section on Nick.com.

On February 12, 2025, the international websites (except the UK, German, Latin American, Brazilian, Arabian, Indian, Canadian and Italian websites) were closed in favor of the Global page on this website.

==Features==
===Games===
In 2001, Nickelodeon partnered with Networks Inc. to provide broadband video games for rent from Nick.com. The move was a further step in the multimedia direction that the developers wanted to take the website. Skagerlind indicated that over 50% of Nick.com&#x27;s audience are using a high speed connection which allows them to expand the gaming options on the website.

On January 6, 2006, Nickelodeon launched &quot;New Game of the Week&quot;, which was a service that showcased an Adobe Flash game based on Nickelodeon content. The first New Game of the Week was &quot;Jimmy Timmy Power Hour 2: Co-Pilot Chaos&quot;, based on Jimmy Neutron from &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius&quot; and Timmy Turner from &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;. When the service was launched, Nick.com had over 228 million game plays in the same fiscal quarter, which was partially attributed to &quot;New Game of the Week&quot;. A new game was showcased every Friday. The New Game of the week of the year has had many wins on their SpongeBob games, such as Bikini Bottom Bust Up, Dunces and Dragons, Invasion of the Lava King, and more. Access to the online games was removed in December 2018, but has been somewhat restored in August 2022.

25 more games were added because of NickJr.com recently closing down for a Nick.com refresh.

===Videos and episodes===
Nick.com provided streaming videos of full or partial Nickelodeon episodes. The service was originally launched as &quot;TurboNick&quot;, a popup panel showcasing broadband content such as video clips and games. It was then revamped and relaunched on July 1, 2005, as a sister website for Nick.com. The new website expanded on clips and content on Nick.com to provide full length Nickelodeon television shows. The United States service was again revamped in 2009 and began focusing exclusively on content from Nick&#x27;s current schedule. With the ubiquitousness of online streaming, &quot;TurboNick&quot; branding was also phased out at this time.

Along with the website&#x27;s redesign in July 2014, Nickelodeon introduced its first web-exclusive series, &quot;Welcome to the Wayne&quot;. Citing changes in viewer preferences, the series is the beginning of a push to create content that can exist on multiple platforms such as online, through mobile devices, as well as television. At the same time, amid declining TV ratings in its third season, Nickelodeon stopped airing the series &quot;The Legend of Korra&quot; on the primary Nickelodeon network and shifted its distribution to online outlets, where the show had proven to be much more successful. Moving the series to online distribution from outlets such as Nick.com and third-party outlets such as Amazon Video, Google Play, Xbox Video and Hulu reflected what series creator Michael DiMartino called a &quot;sea change&quot; in the industry: While &quot;Korra&quot; didn&#x27;t fit in well with Nickelodeon&#x27;s other programming, the series did extremely well online, with the season 2 finale having been Nickelodeon&#x27;s biggest online event. Following the remainder of its third season, season four of &quot;The Legend of Korra&quot; premiered in the United States on October 3, 2014, exclusively through online distribution. Along with the Nick App, access to full episodes requires a TV Everywhere log in.

Nick.com in the UK does not offer the same ability to watch entire episodes, but offers short clips from Nickelodeon TV shows instead.
Episodes and videos are available on Nick.com in the US and the videos and episodes are now available on the Nick app.

===Radio===

Nick.com streams Nick Radio, a radio network launched on September 30, 2013, in partnership with iHeartMedia (then called Clear Channel Communications). The network is also distributed through the iHeartRadio web platform and mobile app as well as New York City radio station WHTZ as a secondary HD channel. Nick Radio focuses on Top 40 music (geared towards the network&#x27;s target audience of children and adolescents, with radio edits of some songs incorporated due to inappropriate content), along with celebrity interview features. In addition to regular on-air DJs, Nick Radio also occasionally features guest DJ stints by stars from Nickelodeon&#x27;s original series.

=== Shows ===
Nick.com maintains informational pages on Nickelodeon&#x27;s current programming lineup. Although the content for each program page included Games, Videos, and Episodes that could be accessed through other parts of the site, show pages can also included show photos and character breakdowns.

== Former features ==

=== Nicktropolis ===
&quot;Nicktropolis&quot; was a massively multiplayer online role-playing game provided by Nickelodeon on Nick.com. It was a virtual community that used isometric 3D graphics. It allowed users to play games, watch video clips and explore locations based on Nickelodeon television shows. Construction of &quot;Nicktropolis&quot; began in November 2004, by Nickelodeon&#x27;s developers Mark Zadroga, Alex Westerman, Deborah Levine, Patrick Dorey, Sean McEvoy, and Jason Root.
The game used the TheoSDK and TheoAvatarSDK engines. An alpha of the game was released in early 2006. The first beta was released in June 2006. From August 18, 2006, to January 6, 2007, the game was closed to the general public. Prior to this release, almost 3,000,000 children had tested the game. The service was finally launched to the public on January 30, 2007.

Following the official launch of the service, additional improvements were made. In March 2007, the game was remodeled and given a new logo, and on May 11, 2007, the home page was remodeled to fit in with Nick.com&#x27;s new look. On June 24, 2007, the game was featured in The New York Times, with a quote stating, &quot;Pre-teenage viewers have a virtual playground to call their own.&quot; In September 2007, the &quot;Nicktropolis Newsletter&quot; was launched, as an e-mail service to players, and in November 2007, the service became ad-supported. By July 3, 2008, &quot;Nicktropolis&quot; had over 7,000,000 registered users. That same year, the service introduced daily events on weekdays, the &quot;Nicktropolis Blog&quot; on the Nick.com message boards, and a new area to support &quot;The Big Green Help&quot;, the year-long Nickelodeon green campaign.

The game received positive ratings in terms of appropriateness for children, with mixed critical reviews. The service was redesigned as &quot;The Club&quot; on May 19, 2010. &quot;The Club&quot; later closed in September 2014.

===Nick Arcade===
Nick Arcade (sharing a name with, but otherwise unrelated to, the TV series of the same name) was a series of games that could be downloaded from Nick.com. It allowed users to play any game before buying it. Nick Arcade games used to be on Nickelodeon&#x27;s sister website, Shockwave.

===Message boards===
Nick.com offered a moderated Internet forum called the Message Boards. On the boards, kids posted threads and replied on topics based on Nickelodeon content. Emoticons were represented with icon GIFs. Notable Moderators were called NICKFrog and NICKPhilly.

Along with the redesigned Nick.com, the Message Boards were completely redesigned to match up with it in 2014. The message boards were then closed on March 31, 2016, after Nick.com removed the option to sign up as a user on the site.

==Reception==
The critical reaction for Nick.com has been generally positive, winning numerous awards.

The website has received two awards from the Broadcast Designers Association, getting a bronze award in 2001 and a silver in 2002. In 2003, Nick.com received a Judge&#x27;s Choice Webby in the Television section. In 1999, Nick.com received the first Internet privacy seal from BBBOnline, a subsidiary of CBBB that assesses privacy issues online.

<doc id="731509" wikidata="Q262285" url="?curid=731509" title="Lars Ohly">
<text>Lars-Magnus Harald Christoffer Ohly (; born 13 January 1957) is a Swedish politician, and the former party chairman of the Swedish Left Party. He was a member of the Swedish parliament from 1998 to 2014.

== Early life and career ==
Lars Ohly was born in the Spånga suburb of Stockholm. His father, like all his forefathers for six generations, was a priest. He grew up in various places around Stockholm. After finishing his mandatory military service in the Swedish Army in 1977 and &quot;gymnasium&quot; (secondary) education in 1978, he started working at Statens Järnvägar (Swedish State Railways), where he later became a conductor (). He is still employed at SJ, but is on leave of absence since 1994.

Ohly became a member of the Liberal Youth of Sweden, the youth wing of the Liberal People&#x27;s Party, in 1970, but left shortly afterwards, and became a communist. He joined the Communist Youth in 1978, and the Left Party in 1979. He became a member of board of the Communist Youth in 1980, was elected as a substitute of the party board in 1987, and became a full member of the party board in 1990. From 1994 to 2000, he was party secretary, and in 2004, he was elected party chairman. He has been a Member of Parliament since 1998.

Lars Ohly was in 2008 nominated for the award &quot;Kurd friend of the year&quot; (Swedish: Årets kurdvän 2008). &quot;Årets kurdvän&quot; is one of the awards presented annually by the Kurdish gala jury that celebrates the active and successful Kurds and friends of Kurds in Sweden.

In August 2011, Ohly announced his resignation. He was elected party chairman on 20 February 2004, succeeding Ulla Hoffmann.

In November 2017, Ohly was banned from attending Left Party events, including the party congress, after allegations of sexual harassment towards women. He left the party in January 2018.

== Controversies ==

=== Nacka Skoglund ===
During his first weeks as party chairman, Ohly claimed in an interview to once have, as a boy, played football against Swedish football legend Nacka Skoglund in a friendly match. The newspaper &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; later revealed that this claim was most likely fictitious. When confronted about this, Ohly claimed it to be an indeliberate error on his part.

=== Being a communist or not ===
Lars Ohly used to be an outspoken communist. On 5 October 2005, &quot;Uppdrag granskning&quot; in Sveriges Television (the Swedish public service television) aired a programme about Lars Ohly&#x27;s background and views on democracy. In the programme, Ohly was accused of trying to rewrite his own history and of hiding his past. Several quotes by Ohly were found where he defended the political systems of the Eastern bloc. Several prominent party members, among them former party leader Lars Werner, also witnessed about Ohly&#x27;s views. It was also found that, in 2000, Ohly had reworded a letter of apology to the &quot;Kiruna-Swedes&quot; - victims of harassment from the Left Party after their return home from Soviet custody - with a number of critical references to Joseph Stalin being removed. The programme also showed that Ohly branded himself as a Leninist as late as 1999.

Following this controversy, the leaders of all the other parliamentary parties have urged Ohly to drop his adherence to communism. On 30 October 2005, Ohly declared on Swedish TV that he would stop labeling himself a communist. But he stressed at the same time that he would stay faithful to the ideals of communism and always would keep fighting for a &quot;classless society&quot;.

=== Swedish-Cuban Association ===
During the controversy regarding Ohly&#x27;s views on communism and his definition of socialism and socialist leadership, Ohly&#x27;s membership in the Swedish-Cuban Association became known. The Swedish-Cuban Association supported the government of Fidel Castro in Cuba and does not want to label the country as a dictatorship. Ohly then released a statement that he considers Cuba to be a dictatorship and that he is critical of the lack of political freedom in Cuba, a statement which in response was criticized by the chairman of the Swedish-Cuban Association. In September 2005, Ohly declared that he had left the organisation.

=== Middle finger during a live debate ===
During a live debate on Swedish TV4 on 18 September 2006, the day after the Swedish general election, Ohly caused some controversy when he showed the middle finger to the right-wing commentator Marie Söderqvist for calling his leadership style typical of a communist. Ohly later apologized and said that he experienced a &quot;temporary blackout&quot;.

=== Choosing private welfare ===
Ohly is strongly opposed to letting privately owned companies operate in industries traditionally controlled by the Swedish state, for instance education and healthcare. However, both his children go to private schools. Ohly says his children made their choices based on what was best for them, independent of his views on the matter. In 2010, he chose to have his meniscus surgery at the private hospital Sophiahemmet. A fan of leasehold estates over condominiums, Ohly himself made a considerable profit from a four-room condominium in the Stockholm City Centre which he bought in 2006 and sold in 2010.

=== Reacting to the fall of Communism ===
Ohly is often cited to have said he cried tears of sadness when learning of the tearing down of the Berlin Wall. In September 2010, he claimed this a false quote political opponents and op-ed writers (primarily Peter Wolodarski, political editor at Dagens Nyheter) keep attributing to him. When reporter Janne Josefsson of Uppdrag Granskning confronted him with an interview clip from 2004 where the statement was uttered, Ohly refused to watch it. Instead, he claimed to have been happy about the events at the time, mentioning that his best friend had sent him a joyous message from Prague in 1989 when the city was being liberated. He initially claimed to have received an SMS message from his friend, which was impossible, since the world&#x27;s first text message was sent in 1992. He later claimed that he actually spoke to his friend by phone.

<text>The loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is one of the most commonly used approaches to treat high grade cervical dysplasia (CIN II/III, HGSIL) and early stage cervical cancer discovered on colposcopic examination. In the UK, it is known as large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ). It is considered a type of conization. It has been in use since the 1970s, after its invention by Dr. Sheldon Weinstein. 

LEEP has many advantages including low cost and a high success rate. The procedure can be done in an office setting and usually only requires a local anesthetic, though sometimes IV sedation or a general anesthetic is used. Disadvantages include reports of decreased sexual satisfaction and potential for preterm labor, though a meta-analysis published in 2014 suggested that in patients with existing CIN lesions as opposed to controls, the risk is not more than their baseline risk. Approximately 500,000 LEEP procedures are performed in the U.S. annually. 

==Process==
When performing a LEEP, the physician uses a wire loop through which an electric current is passed at variable power settings. Various shapes and sizes of loop can be used depending on the size and orientation of the lesion. The cervical transformation zone and lesion are excised to an adequate depth, which in most cases is at least 8 mm, and extending 4 to 5 mm beyond the lesion. A second pass with a more narrow loop can also be done to obtain an endocervical specimen for further histologic evaluation.

The LEEP technique results in some thermal artifact in all specimens obtained due to the use of electricity which simultaneously cuts and cauterizes the lesion, but this does not generally interfere with pathological interpretation provided depth is not exceeded. The thermal artifact can be a function of depth and time.

==Complications==
Complications are less frequent in comparison to a cold-knife conization but can include infection and hemorrhage.

LEEP effectively reduces the risk of cancer developing or spreading but it causes an increased risk of premature birth in future pregnancies. Following LEEP there is a 10% chance of cancer recurrence and 11% chance of preterm birth. This perspective carries significant implications when it comes to pregnancy timing and decision making in women of child bearing age who have cervical dysplasia and would like to decide whether they should have the lesions removed before or after pregnancy. As pregnancy is generally understood to be an immune suppressed state, the viral mediated character of cervical lesions might also inform revisions to treatment recommendations in such instances.

Some women report a small decrease in sexual arousal and satisfaction following LEEP but there is a lack of high quality research showing how LEEP affects sexual function.

<text>Joseph Doucé (April 13, 1945 – ) was born to a rural family in Sint-Truiden, Belgium. He was a psychologist and a (defrocked) Baptist pastor in Paris. He was openly gay and was among the founders of the International Lesbian and Gay Association. He served as a volunteer soldier in the NATO base at Limoges, France, where he had time to perfect his French. After one year of pastoral and humanistic studies at Stenonius College (also known as Europaseminär, a Roman Catholic seminary today extinct) in Maastricht, the Netherlands, he began his conversion to Protestantism around 1966.

His &quot;Centre du Christ Libérateur&quot; was a ministry to sexual minorities. The center had support groups for homosexuals, transsexuals, sadomasochists and pedophiles.

==Death==
Doucé was killed and the murder has never been solved. According to Doucé&#x27;s lover, he was taken away by two men, who showed police badges on July 19, 1990. The body was found in a forest in October 1990.

<doc id="731539" wikidata="Q1171056" url="?curid=731539" title="Manuel Rojas Luzardo">
<text>Manuel Rojas Luzardo (c. 1831 – October 14, 1903) was a Puerto Rican-Venezuelan commander of the Puerto Rican Liberation Army and one of the main leaders of the Grito de Lares uprising against Spanish rule in Puerto Rico.

==Early years==
Manuel Rojas Luzardo was born in the city of Obispos in the state of Barinas, Venezuela, from a Puerto Rican father and a Venezuelan mother. There he received his primary and secondary education. Rojas was a dedicated agricultural worker and when he had saved enough money he moved to Valencia, Spain where he became a successful businessmen. In the early 19th century Venezuela&#x27;s economy was in turmoil because of internal wars. Rojas decided to go to Puerto Rico where he met and married Obdulia de los Ríos.

The Rojas family moved close to the town of Lares where they settled down. The region was mountainous and its main income came from the coffee crop. Rojas and his brother, Miguel eventually bought and cultivated a coffee plantation. The successful plantation was called &quot;El Triunfo&quot;, and both men became wealthy merchants. His brother Miguel meet Mariana Bracetti while on a business trip to Añasco. Miguel and Mariana married and moved to &quot;El Triunfo&quot; where the Rojas lived.

==Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence movement==

Rojas admired Puerto Rican independence advocate Ramón Emeterio Betances and together with his brother Miguel, joined Betances in his quest for Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence. A &quot;Revolution Committee of Puerto Rico&quot; was formed and directed by Betances and Segundo Ruiz Belvis, who were exiled, from the Dominican Republic. Several revolutionary cells were formed in the towns and cities in the western part of the island. They were to support the armed invasion that Betances had planned to bring from the Dominican Republic.

Two of the most important cells were that of Mayagüez, whose leader was Mathias Brugman and code named &quot;Capa Prieto&quot; and that of Lares, code named &quot;Centro Bravo&quot; and headed by Manuel Rojas. &quot;Centro Bravo&quot; was the main center of operations and was located in the Rojas plantation. Manuel Rojas was named &quot;Commander of the Liberation Army&quot; by Betances. Mariana Bracetti (wife of Miguel) was named &quot;Leader of the Lares Revolutionary Council&quot;. Upon the request of Betances, Bracetti knitted the revolutionary Flag of Lares known as &quot;La Bandera de Lares&quot;.

The Revolutionary Committee named twelve of their members generals of the revolution. They were:

*Manuel Rojas, Commander in Chief of the Liberation Army
*Andres Pol, General of Division
*Juan de Mata Terraforte, General of Division
*Joaquín Parrilla, General of Division
*Nicolás Rocafort, General of Division
*Gabino Plumey, General of Division
*Dorvid Beauchamp, General of Division
*Mathías Brugman, General of Division
*Rafael Arroyo, General of Division
*Francisco Arroyo, General of Division
*Pablo Rivera, Cavalry General
*Abdón Pagán, Artillery General

The Spanish authorities found out about the plot and were able to confiscate the armed ship which Betances had, before it arrived in Puerto Rico. The Mayor of the town of Camuy, Manuel González (who also happened to be the leader of that town&#x27;s revolutionary cell) was arrested and charged with treason. He was able to hear that the Spanish Army was aware of the independence plot. He then escaped and was able to warn Manuel Rojas.

==El Grito de Lares==

Because of this event, the revolutionists decided to start the revolution as soon as possible and set the date for September 23, 1868. Mathias Brugman and his men joined up with Manuel Rojas&#x27;s men and with about 800 men and women, marched and took the town of Lares in what is known as &quot;El Grito de Lares&quot;. The revolutionists entered the town&#x27;s church and placed the revolutionary flag knitted by Bracetti on the High Altar as a sign that the revolution had begun. They declared Puerto Rico to be the &quot;Republic of Puerto Rico&quot; and named Francisco Ramírez Medina President of the Republic of Puerto Rico.

Rojas and his poorly armed followers proceeded to march on to the town of San Sebastián, armed only with clubs and machetes. The Spanish Army had been forewarned and were waiting for them with superior firepower. When the revolutionists arrived, they were met with deadly fire.

The revolt failed and many of the revolutionists were killed and at least 475 including, Manuel Rojas and Mariana Bracetti were imprisoned in the jail of Arecibo and sentenced to death. Some of them fled and went into hiding. Mathias Brugman was hiding in a local farm when a farm hand by the name of Francisco Quiñones, betrayed him and led the Spanish Authorities to Brugman&#x27;s hiding place. He was executed on the spot.

==Aftermath==
He was arrested that October and sentenced to death by a court-martial. Eugenio María de Hostos led a group of Puerto Ricans who defended those who were involved in the revolt. They met with Spanish President Francisco Serrano (Serrano had just led a revolution against the monarchy in Spain) in Madrid and requested that Rojas and the others be pardoned and that the government not carry out the death penalties imposed upon them. Serrano told de Hostos that if an amnesty was granted it would be for the natives of Puerto Rico and not for the foreigners who participated in the revolt, referring to Rojas. However, de Hostos argued that Rojas was an adoptive son of Puerto Rico, since he arrived in the island at a young age and made it his home and as such should have the same rights that the others had. The incoming governor of Puerto Rico, Jose Sanz, received orders from the new Republican Spanish Government to grant a general amnesty to all those imprisoned, effective on September 20, 1869. Manuel Rojas along with some of the other men involved in the revolution were sent into exile.

Rojas was exiled to Venezuela and went to live in Boconó a city in the Venezuelan Andean state of Trujillo. Little is known about what he did after he went into exile except that he died on October 14, 1903, in Boconó. On December 25, 2002, the Government of Puerto Rico approved Public Law #291, which instructed the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture to study the possibility of transferring the remains of Manuel Rojas, considered by many to be among Puerto Rico&#x27;s greatest independence leaders.

==Legacy==
A school in Bartolo, Lares, Puerto Rico is named after Rojas.

<text>The Mazda MPV (Multi-Purpose Passenger Vehicle) is a minivan manufactured by Mazda. Introduced in 1988 as a rear-wheel-drive model with optional selectable four-wheel drive, this was replaced in 1999 with a front-wheel-drive version with optional all-wheel-drive in some markets. Over one million MPV models have been produced since its introduction.

== First generation (LV; 1988)==

The MPV was designed from the ground-up as a minivan specifically for the American market, and was introduced in 1988 for the 1989 model year. It was based on the large rear-wheel-drive Mazda Luce&#x27;s platform. The platform allowed such options as a V6 engine, and optional four-wheel drive. However this large platform created some liabilities in other markets. When it was introduced in Japan in January 1990, its engine displacement and exterior dimensions exceeded Japanese government regulations for vehicles classified as &quot;compact&quot;, and as a result, Japanese buyers were liable for additional annual taxes. It was available at Mazda&#x27;s Japanese luxury dealership network Ɛ̃fini starting in 1991.

Its selectable 4WD system is not to be confused with all road conditions &quot;all-wheel-drive&quot; systems; the MPV can be switched into locked 4WD with a switch mounted on the column gear selector. A dash mounted switch controlled the center differential, creating a locked power distributions on the front and rear axles. The 4WD is not for use on dry roads, but can be engaged and disengaged while moving. Its efficient use of interior space while offering a relatively small exterior drew from Mazda&#x27;s experience with space efficient one-box minivans, like the Mazda Bongo.

Unlike other minivans, the MPV&#x27;s parking brake was directly on the floor beside the driver&#x27;s seat and operated by the hand, when most other minivans had the parking brake in the driver footwell area and operated by the left foot. Like the later Honda Odyssey introduced in North America in early 1995, it featured traditional hinged doors instead of sliding rear doors, though the original MPV only had a single rear door. This was also the only Mazda MPV generation sold in North America with a manual transmission, offered in the &#x27;89 through &#x27;91 model years. The middle row was available as a 3-person bench, allowing seating for eight, when most minivans only seated seven. Because of the MPV&#x27;s optional 4WD, the Mazda Navajo version of the Ford Explorer (sold from 1990 to 1994) was only offered as a two-door, so as to minimize internal competition.

The van was named to &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list for 1990 and 1991 and featured as one of their &quot;vehicles for the coming (fuel) crisis&quot;. Initial sales were strong as well, but rapidly fell off once other makers introduced all-wheel drive and V6 engines. In the years to come, Toyota&#x27;s 1991 Previa, Nissan&#x27;s 1993 Quest, and Honda&#x27;s 1995 Odyssey had entered the market and began diluting Mazda&#x27;s market share. Sales weren&#x27;t helped when the MPV received one star out of four in the Australian Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) crash tests and a &quot;Marginal&quot; rating in the American Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash tests for damage to the occupant compartment, tire intrusion into the driver footwell area, poor dummy kinematics, and possibility of injuries to both legs.

In 1992 for the 1993 model year, a new Mazda emblem and a remote keyless entry system were introduced. A standard driver&#x27;s airbag was later introduced in early 1993.

The van was facelifted in 1995 for the 1996 model year, adding driver&#x27;s side rear door, passenger side airbag, and extending the nose for improved crash protection. While the four-cylinder engine was retired for the American and Canadian markets, it was replaced with a similar but somewhat smaller 2.5 L unit for the rest of the world. A mild refresh was introduced in 1997 for the 1998 model year with &quot;all-sport&quot; body cladding and wheel arches, and polished alloy wheels. Mazda discontinued the original MPV after the 1998 model year for North America, and after the 1999 model year for the rest of the world.


== Second generation (LW; 1999)==

The MPV was replaced in June 1999, using the short-wheelbase, front-wheel-drive G platform, with the optional 4WD system discontinued in most markets, or replaced with an all-conditions all-wheel-drive system in some markets. It now featured dual sliding rear doors equipped with roll-down windows and a third-row seat that could fold and tumble into a floor recess much like the Honda Odyssey. In the North American markets, the MPV was set apart from other minivans by its comparatively sporty chassis. The new G platform allowed for a longer car with more interior space than the rear-wheel drive predecessor.

In the Japanese domestic market, the second generation was a much stronger seller than its predecessor, with initial orders tripling the projected sales.

At introduction, the MPV used the same 170 hp DOHC 2.5 L Ford Duratec V6 unit that powered the Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique and Cougar. DX models featured a two-place middle bench seat. The LX model featured two middle buckets with a feature whereby the passenger side seat could slide sideways (marketed as &quot;side by slide&quot;), power windows and locks, heated power mirrors, privacy glass, and antilock brakes. The ES model added leather seating surfaces, wood tone interior trim, side impact air bags on the front seats, bigger wheels, and dual zone front and rear air conditioners.

In model year 2001, all models added child-safety seat tether anchors. An optional GFX sport appearance package was made available for LX and ES models, which included fog lights and aero body add-ons. The 2001 model year ran long, extending into early 2002 in anticipation of the 2002 refresh.

In model year 2002, North American-market MPVs received Mazda&#x27;s AJ 3.0 L V6 producing and of torque, a 5-speed automatic transmission, a new grille featuring a single chrome bar at the top, power sliding side doors (not available on the Australian market), revised suspension settings, and 17-inch alloy wheels. In the Japanese and other markets, the 2.0 and 2.5-liter four-cylinders were replaced by the new 2.3 L L3-VE direct injection (DISI) inline-four, as first seen in the all-new Mazda6. In Europe a , 2.0-liter &quot;MZR&quot; common-rail turbodiesel engine was also available.

In model year 2003, power operation of the side doors was made optional on the LX and ES. A base LX-SV model was added midway into the model year.

In model year 2004, the MPV received a mild exterior and interior makeover. The exterior featured new headlights and Altezza style clear taillights. Interior changes included a new steering wheel, gauge surrounds, and a spring assist to ease folding the third row seat into the floor. The LX Sport package added a customized look with alloy wheels, body side skirts, enhanced tail lights, anti-lock brakes, an air dam under the bumper, and an optional rear-mounted spoiler. The ES model added leather seats, rear air conditioner, power sliding doors, and a choice of moonroof or roof-mounted DVD player. No LX-SV model was offered.

In model year 2005, dual zone air conditioning became an optional feature on the LX (it had been standard on the LX in 2004).

In model year 2006, a base LX-SV model was again offered alongside the LX and ES models.

The MPV was discontinued in both Europe and North America after model year 2006. The MPV was also replaced in North America and Australia by the full-size Mazda CX-9 crossover SUV. Australian models were available with three seats in the second row, and two seats in the third row instead of a folding third row.

Engines:
* 1999–2002 2.0 L FS-DE I4 (non-US)
* 1999–2002 2.5 L GY-DE V6 (non-US)
* 2002–2006 3.0 L AJ V6
* 2002–2005 2.3 L MZR 2.3 Direct Injection Spark Ignition (DISI) I4 (non-US)
* 2002–2005 2.0 L MZR RF common rail turbo-diesel I4 (Europe)

For 2006, the base MSRP for MPV models was LX-SV ($22,115), LX:(22,950) and ES ($28,515).

The Mazda MPV earned an &quot;Acceptable&quot; rating in the IIHS offset frontal crash test in 2000 for fair structural performance and very high forces on the dummy&#x27;s right foot. In 2005, it earned a &quot;Poor&quot; rating in the side-impact crash test without the optional side airbags, indicating that high injuries to the driver and rear occupant are possible.

== Third generation (LY; 2006)==
In February 2006, the third generation Mazda MPV went on sale in Japan, having debuted earlier in October 2005 at the Tokyo Motor Show. It was powered by either a four-cylinder MZR Direct Injection Spark Ignition (DISI) 2.3-litre naturally aspirated engine or the turbo version of the same. The second row reclining seats featured an unusual retracting footrest feature. The gear shift was moved from the steering column to the center console, much like most other minivans by Japanese automakers today. The launch of the third generation MPV was famously known for its television commercials narrated by a middle-aged woman saying the tagline, &quot;Supōtsukā no hassō de, miniban wo kaeru.&quot; (スポーツカーの発想で、ミニバンを変える。&quot;The idea of a sports car - inherited by a minivan.&quot;)

The third generation MPV was available only in Japan, China, Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and New Zealand. It was known as the Mazda8 in Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia. The 4WD and Turbo models are available only in the domestic (Japanese) market, while all export models (usually known as Mazda8) are naturally aspirated FWD models only. In New Zealand, it was known as the MPV and is available in four-cylinder only.

It was not sold to North America, Europe and other LHD markets besides China. The Mazda CX-9 (North America and Australasia only) and Mazda5 filled the segment gap in these markets.

In 2008, a facelifted version was introduced. External modifications include a new front bumper with new fog lights. A five-speed automatic transaxle replaced the four-speed unit used in NA FWD models. Six-speed Automatics remained in the turbo and 4WD models.

Turbo models were discontinued in 2010. A Malaysian version was introduced that year, making this the fourth market in which the third generation Mazda MPV was to be sold.

In 2012, a 2.5L engine version mated with five-speed automatic replaced the 2.3L with four-speed in China.

<text>Drużno (; , ) is a body of water historically considered a lake in northern Poland on the east side of the Vistula delta, near the city of Elbląg. As it is currently not deep enough to qualify as a lake hydrologically and receives some periodic inflow of sea water from the Vistula Lagoon along the Elbląg River, some suggest that it be termed an estuary reservoir. A village of recent origin also called Drużno is situated near the lake.

The German name &quot;Drausensee&quot;, in earlier records called &quot;Drusensee&quot;, is connected to the ancient trade city of Truso, which stood within the lands now occupied by Elbląg. The lake is greatly reduced from its original size partly due to large building expansion of housing in the last few decades, but mainly because of the natural death of the lake by sedimentation. The lake is the site of a nature reserve, one of the 13 sites in Poland protected under the Ramsar convention.

An old mention of the name is as a place named &quot;Truso&quot; in the report of sailor Wulfstan from the end of the 9th century. The report was included in &quot;&quot; which was written in Anglo-Saxon in King Alfred&#x27;s reign.

==Geography==
The central coordinates of the lake are . It lies to the east of the Nogat, the main right branch of the lower Vistula, at the edge of the lowland of the delta (Żuławy Wiślane), which is a region of shifting sediments and channels partly controlled by dikes, dams and ditches. The lake is about in area and sometimes up to below sea level. The delta ends at Elbląg upland (Wysoczyzna Elbląska), much of which is wooded. The delta itself is sparsely populated, despite the presence of large cities nearby (Gdańsk, Elblag and others). Most of it is rich agricultural land and the rest is a wildlife habitat.

The lake today is a . body of water with a mean depth of about and a maximum depth of . The lake is drained by the Elbląg River. There is only a difference in altitude between the lake and Elbląska Bay, which projects from Vistula Lagoon. The surface altitude of these bodies varies for a few reasons, such as wind. When there is a strong wind blowing to the south the bay can be a meter or so higher than the lake, which causes back currents in the river.

The Prussians called Vistula Lagoon by the name &quot;fresh-water bay&quot;, which it was in those days. Since then the greatly diminished egress of Vistula water, due to human uses, has
brought Baltic water into the bay, now brackish. As a result, back currents in the river bring intrusions of brackish water into the lake. Generally the southern end remains fresh. There probably always were reversals of river current, which must have speeded traffic between Frisches Haff and the lake.

The lake is surrounded by and includes marsh, swamp and alder thickets. On its surface are floating Nymphaea, submerged are Potamogeton and the marshes feature tracts of Phragmites. It should have sedimented over long ago but the high throughput of water from various sources brings fresh Oxygen into the lake, retarding its aging.

Twelve streams empty into the lake radially, with water from another twelve canals being pumped into it. They bring about into the lake (1970) with about 7 draining through the river (1975). Variability in these figures as well as wind and back currents cause expansion and contraction of the lake over wide areas. The total capacity is about with a catchment area of .
==Historical uses of the lake==
The lake is valuable currently mainly as a nature preserve. Some 20,000 migratory waterfowl use it, chiefly Anser, Anas, Grus and Chlidonias.

In ancient times the lake was deeper and of wider extent. In the troubled Viking Age and the conflicts and acts of piracy between the various tribes of the Balts and voyagers from Scandinavia and elsewhere, the lake would have been an ideal masked route for shallow-draft vessels, such as the Viking ships. When the lake became useless for that purpose Elblag was still a port with access to the Zalew Wislany and through there to the Gulf of Danzig. It rose to prominence as that. The remains of Truso may be one of the archaeological sites in the area, or it may be under Elblag, or may have been obliterated by construction.

In an attempt to make the inland region more accessible, the Prussian government opened the Elbląg Canal through the lake in 1860. The northern terminus of the canal route to the south is Elbląg. It runs through a dredged channel in the lake and becomes an overland canal to the south; that is, the canal is composed of sections connected by tracks for lifting and lowering vessels. It joins a number of lakes to the south, but they are not drained by the canal. During its life the canal was used mainly to haul timber to the coast. After destruction in World War II the canal was restored in 1948 but finds little commercial use now. Instead the entire route has been converted into a recreational area featuring nature preserves such as Lake Druzno.

==Prehistory of the lake==

===Janow Pomorski site===
Janow Pomorski was after 1945 the name of the village of Hansdorf about 7 km to the southeast of Elbing (now Elbląg) where the traces of some workshops have been found that were on the then edge of the lake. A large abundance of finished and partly finished artifacts in antler and amber have been found. They were manufactured in structures of about , and long houses about above ground, three rooms, made of wood, believed to be residences also. A cache of wrecked boats has been found. The artifacts are similar to both Slavic and Scandinavian equivalents. Some archaeologists suggest that this may be the site of Truso; however, the name may have referred to a collection of settlements.

The settlement is dated from the late 8th century to the early 10th by pottery. Trenches nearby have uncovered two layers of peat sandwiching a layer of peat and sand over a thick layer of silt. The layers have been dated by a variety of methods. The history of the lake is roughly reconstructed as follows:
* Originally Ebląska Bay extended into the region of the lake.
* Extension of the Vistula Delta closed off the lake from the bay at about 2000 BP.
* A rise in sea level brought the lake and the bay together again.
* A second advance of the delta created the current configuration by 1000 BP except that the lake was larger and deeper. It has been filling in and growing over since then.

The lake in this view is seen as a transitory phenomenon created by accidents of topography and the growth of the Vistula Delta. The combined lake and bay might have served as a natural border in antiquity but whether it was one remains to be demonstrated. Truso must have been settled between the 2000 BP and 1000 BP lake maxima. Truso might well have been at Janów Pomorski, but the artifacts give no indication that the native populations were Prussian, Slavic or Scandinavian.

It is true that in 1237 the entire right bank of the lower Vistula was occupied by Old Prussians and that Truso was in or projected into the Old Prussian dukedom of Pomesania. Moreover, Adalbert of Prague, who came with Boleslaw Chrobrie&#x27;s soldiers, had been beheaded further north-east at the coast of the Baltic Sea near (Fischhausen), now Rybaki, for cutting down the sacred groves of the Old Prussians as part of an effort to conquer them under guise to convert them in (997 AD). This circumstantial evidence is not conclusive about the ethnicity of the founders of Truso.

In 1237 also the Teutonic Order opened hostilities against the Old Prussians, putting down a castle at the future Elbing. The order&#x27;s modus operandi was to sack and burn an Old Prussian town and then hold it against reoccupation with a stone keep nearby, around which a new town of Germanic or mixed ethnicity would grow. There is no evidence yet that they practiced that method on Truso, although the question is still open. According to the Museum at Elbląg, Truso was burned down by pirates or robbers two centuries before. Its relationship to the order at Elbing remains unknown.

===Ptolemy and the prehistory===
Ptolemy, writing in the period of the initial lake, refers to the entire Gulf of Gdańsk as Venedicus Bay and states that the Greater Venedae occupied its coast. The name is known also among the Slavic Wends, but he may have meant by &quot;Greater&quot; that Balts were to be included; if not, one would have to ask where the historical Balts came from. There were some historical Vends later in Latvia, who may have been their descendants.

Ptolemy does mention the Prussians by name (Borusci), but also the Gythones appear at the mouth of the Vistula. These can be interpreted as Goths or the early settlements of Gdańsk might have been there under that name. There is no explicit mention of a town of Danzig and he does not give his usual list of river towns for the Vistula and eastward. Truso was at a location where already in the Roman Empire and before the (only) people who collected and traded amber shipped it south on the Amber Road to Carnuntium and further. In Old Prussian history it is known, that Northmen, Danes came to Prussia and intermarried. A number of swords along the Nemunas river, attest to their presence.

===Wulfstan and the prehistory===
Wulfstan of Hedeby left an account of a voyage dated to about 880 AD as told to Alfred the Great and inserted into his translation of Orosius&#x27; &quot;Histories&quot;. It is the first mention of the lake in history and also briefly describes the Prussians of the times, which he calls &quot;Aesti&quot; .Aisti- Aesti (meaning easterners) was the name used for Baltic Prussian in records starting 800 years earlier.

Wulfstan sailed from Hedeby (Haithabu), Jutland to Truso in seven days keeping Weonodland (&quot;Wendland&quot;) on the right as far as the mouth of the Weissel (Vistula). These Venedi are on the opposite bank of the Vistula from the Greater Venedi of Ptolemy. By mouth of the Vistula Wulfstan explains that he means the passage between Frisches Haff and the Bay of Danzig.

The Ilfing River runs east of the Weisel from a lake on the banks of which stands Truso into the Estmere (Eastern Sea-Ostsee), where it is incorporated into the Weissel; i.e., Wulfstan sees the Ilfing as a tributary of the Weissel and Estmere as the lower Weissel.

Weonodland extends as far as the Weissel, after which Witland, the westernmost part of Eastland, begins. It is generally agreed that Wulfstan is interpreting the source of Tacitus&#x27; Aestii as Eastland. The Estonians ultimately inherited the name, but in Wulfstan it has to mean at least the Prussians, perhaps further.

This passage tells us that the topography was more or less modern. The lake is not named, but it is considered a lake drained by the Ilfing River. Being east of the Weissel, Truso, the lake and the river must be in Witland, but Wulfstan does not say that. He describes the Estonians (Balts) as being a rich and populous nation divided into towns, each of which was ruled by a king. The passage does not pinpoint Truso as being in Weonodland or Eastland and does not say if they are Estonians.

==Languages of the ethnic populations==
By Ptolemy&#x27;s time the Proto-Balto-Slavic language had divided into Proto-Baltic and Proto-Slavic, perhaps even into dialects. As the greater Venedi and the Weonods cannot have spoken the same language the name must once have applied to both Balts and Slavs (unless Ptolemy was wrong).

Each were on a different bank of the Vistula, Ptolemy&#x27;s border between Greater Germany and European Sarmatia. On the left bank Ptolemy lists only peoples he considers Germans. There is no sign of any Venedi, Pomeranians or Kashubians. The Ruticli live in Pomerania with the Lugii to the south of them. Some Gotini (Goths) and Aelvaeones (Elbingers?, local name is to this day Albinger) dwell on the lower Vistula.

On the right bank are the Gythones. It would not be surprising to find Goths there too, but if the Gythones are Danzigers, they must have extended to Vistula Spit. East of them were the Venedae, south of whom were the Galindae (one of the Prussian tribes). The Venedae therefore must have been the coastal Estonians of Wulfstan, Western Baltic ancestral speakers.

By Wulfstan&#x27;s time the East Germanic tribes had abandoned the left bank of the Vistula. Some may have remained in and around the Vistula Delta, especially Danzig, possibly Truso. The Slavs had expanded north into Pomerania. Proto-Slavic began to differentiate after the Slavs expanded beyond their Carpathian homeland in the 6th century AD, too late for the foundation of Truso.

From the fact that the name of Charlemagne (742-814 AD), which became the Slavic word for king, entered Proto-Slavic, and other indicators used by historical linguists, it has been deduced that Old Church Slavonic is in fact Proto-Slavic. By 1000 AD it was showing traces of influence by regional dialects. By that time the Slavs had been on the Baltic coast for some time; i.e., Wulfstan&#x27;s Weonods were speakers of Proto-Slavic. They were probably there before Charlemagne, but he encouraged them to settle along the Baltic. Adalbert&#x27;s Danzig was not only Christian but very recently under Slavic control, if not to some degree Slavic speaking.

After Adalbert events moved rapidly to produce great changes. Pomerania as a governable territory appeared in the 10th century; by the 11th the initial state of Poland had formed and was contending with the Dukes of Pomerania for control. It was probably at this time that Lekhitic developed and moved rapidly to Polish, Pomeranian, Kashubian and Slovincian. Eastern Pomerania was the Duchy of Pomerelia, which spit into others including Kashubian-speaking areas west of Gdańsk. Kashubian is distinguished by a large number of Low German loans.

On the right bank of the Vistula the Proto-Baltic speakers had been gradually giving ground to the Proto-Slavs in the east and lost Pomerania to Germanic expansion. They divided into West and East Baltic in the middle of the 1st millennium. The Goths achieved domination over the West Balts for a time and then were gone. After 1000 Old Prussian Galindian and Sudovian existed. In East Baltic Lithuanian and Latvian were distinct. Between east and west was Curonian. This was the ethnic distribution when the Teutonic Order received Prussia from the Emperor Frederick II and from the pope. The papal bull also granted them the government of all the Balts, as well as the Finnic Estonians, with consequences that continue today.

The Slavs had been moving in on the Old Prussians but had been stopped by them. The different duchies made hypocritical claims to lands they never controlled and invited the Teutonic Order to suppress &quot;rebellions&quot; there. It is possible therefore that the Kashubian Duchy of Gdańsk was asserting a nominal claim over Lake Drużno and Truso, but it was never one recognized by the Old Prussians.

==The name==
The name of the settlement has been restored in Old Prussian by prominent worldwide acknowledged Balticists, on the basis of Wulfstan&#x27;s German (t/d), as *Drūsā - cf. Druso first by Georg Gerullis (Die altpreußischen Ortsnamen, Berlin 1922, 187), and recently - by Vytautas Maziulis (Prūsu kalbos etimologijos zodynas I, Vilnius 1988, 231). The ending -o corresponds to Common Prussian nominative singular -o (long), well attested in known Old Prussian Written Monuments (so-called &quot;Elbing Vocabulary&quot;). The diphthong au in German Drausen points to the same long *-(Dr)ū-, regularly diphthongized in later Prussian. No problem persists for modern Prussologists as concerns Truso. Such a restoration shows the continuity of Western Baltic on this territory in course of several hundred years, probably even before the attested Truso, which is the first known settlement name in the coastal region. The possible originating cultures are not diminished by this restoration, but the linguistic evidence points to the presence of Balts on this territory.

In one theory the name is Slavic in origin: &quot;(Z)Drużno&quot; means &quot;together&quot; in Slavic languages. It might have been named from being a place of gathering and resting for the caravan traders of various nationalities. However the name Drużno is nothing else as a later polonizing of the original Baltic name.

On the other hand, the historical linguist Julius Pokorny, whose conjectures are strongly outdated at least in the field of the Baltic linguistics, lists *trus-, &quot;reed&quot;, as an Indo-European root, not used in English, but appearing in Old Church Slavonic and Lithuanian words from a Balto-Slavic form *trusom.

If the place was named from the reeds, which are still there, it probably acquired the name Trusom during the growth of the second lake, evolving into the Old Prussian reconstruction from which came the Germanic Drusen, High German Drausen. Such a derivation still does not pinpoint the language spoken by the settlers. However this view does not correspond to conclusions of the main Balticists.

In 1897 and in the 1920s excavations near Gut Hansdorf brought a number of archaeological finds to light and it was assumed that it was Truso. These artifacts were kept at the Elbing Museum. War years and the take-over by communists stopped further research. Recently excavations near Gut Hansdorf (now Janowo) were resumed by Polish authorities and the site of unearthed.

<text>García López de Cárdenas y Figueroa was a Spanish conquistador who was the first European to see the Grand Canyon.

== Life ==
Cárdenas was born in Llerena, then part of Crown of Castile, second son to Alonso de Cárdenas, 1st Count of La Puebla del Maestre, and wife Maria García Osorio. He was the Encomiendador of Caravaca.

López de Cárdenas was a conquistador attached to the exploits of Francisco Vázquez de Coronado. Expeditions, including one led by Pedro de Tovar, had heard reports of a large river north of Cíbola (Zuñi). Cárdenas was dispatched in September 1540 by the general stationed in Cíbola with the express mission of locating such a river and returning within 80 days. Pedro de Sotomayor accompanied him to record the event as a &quot;cronista&quot;, along with Hopi guides, Spanish soldiers, and an unknown number of servants. After some twenty days of marching in a northerly direction, he was successful; but his band found difficulties in reaching the river (which was the current Colorado River, that they called River Tizon), owing to the sheer vertical distance down from their position. They were standing on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon, somewhere between present-day Desert View and Grandview Point. Cárdenas ordered three soldiers, including Pablo de Melgrossa and Juan Galeras, to descend into the canyon. After several days of failed attempts to reach the river (his men were suffering from dehydration), his party was forced to return to Cíbola.

Cárdenas was the only member of the Coronado Expedition to be convicted of war crimes afterward because of his role in the brutal Tiguex War.

<doc id="731559" wikidata="Q1628028" url="?curid=731559" title="Mazda R360">
<text>The Mazda R360 is a kei car manufactured and marketed by Mazda as the company&#x27;s first passenger car — a two-door, four-seat coupé. Introduced in May 1960, the R360 featured a wheelbase, weighed and was powered by a rear-mounted air-cooled 356 cc V-twin engine producing and of torque. The car was capable of and featured a 4-speed manual or two-speed automatic transmission. The suspension, front and rear, was rubber &quot;springs&quot; and torsion bars.

==History==
The R360 was built with the goal of being extremely light weight, as well as low cost. To achieve the weight goal, it was a 2+2 design, with a rear seat not suitable for adults, while the engine was made from aluminium and the chassis also used aluminium and even magnesium alloys. The weight was kept low, only . The use of acrylics rather than glass for the curved rear windshield and the sliding side glass further reduced weight and cost.

The R360 was an immediate success, thanks to its low price, but sales soon dropped. The four-seat Subaru 360 captured much of the lightweight (kei car) market, which led Mazda to augment the R360 by the four-seater Mazda Carol (P360) two-door sedan in 1962. The R360 sold 23,417 examples in its first year, with total cumulative production amounting to 65,737 examples. Full production of the R360 lasted for six years (until 1966), but the automatic version remained available to disabled drivers as a special order until 1969.

== Specification ==
There were two variants of the Mazda R360, officially known as KRBB and KRBC. The KRBB came with a 4-speed manual transmission, whereas the KRBC was equipped with a 2-speed &quot;TORQ DRIVE&quot; automatic transmission.

;Mazda R360, performance and specifications


=== Colours ===
The standard Mazda R360 came in three different exterior colours; Opal Green, Maroon Rouge, and Somerset Blue. The Mazda R360 DeLuxe came in two different two-tone variants: Blue and Cream or Red and Cream.

For the interior of the Mazda R360, the official colour choices were Red or Blue. These colour options were applied to the seats, carpet, and inner door panels.

==B360 Pickup==

The B360 was a pickup truck bodystyle based on parts of the R360 Coupé. It used the same 356 cc engine, but in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Like most pickups, it used a rigid rear axle and leaf spring suspension. The engine was replaced with the Carol&#x27;s 358 cc I4 in 1964, and the B360 was replaced by the Mazda E360 in 1967.

A larger B600 pickup was introduced for the export market. It used a 577 cc version of the Mazda V-twin.

<text>Trinity Grammar School is a multi-campus independent Anglican single-sex early learning, primary and secondary day school for boys, in inner-western Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The main campus in provides a comprehensive education to students from Year 7 to Year 12; the campus in provides a comprehensive education to early learning and primary school students, from Kindergarten to Year 6; and outdoor education facilities are located at Woollamia on the NSW South Coast. The school previously enrolled boarders until the end of 2019.

Founded in 1913 by George Chambers at Dulwich Hill, the school has a non-selective enrolment policy and currently caters for approximately 2,000 (during 2007)students. The Headmaster of Trinity Grammar School is Timothy Bowden.

Trinity is affiliated with the International Boys&#x27; Schools Coalition (IBSC), the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), The Independent Primary School Heads of Australia (IPSHA), which was formerly known as the Junior School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA), the Independent Primary School Heads of Australia, the Australian Boarding Schools&#x27; Association (ABSA), and is a founding member of the Combined Associated Schools (CAS).

== Governance ==
The School is governed by a Council (appointed by ordinance of the Diocese of Sydney), with the Archbishop of Sydney, Kanishka Raffel as the President. The council currently has seventeen members, with six lay members being elected by the Synod of the Diocese of Sydney, six clergy being elected by the Synod, and three being nominated by the Old Trinitarians Union (OTU). The final two positions are voted on by the sitting members of the council. James Mills was Chairman of the School Council for thirty-three years. Richard Pegg is the current chairman.

Trinity Grammar&#x27;s &quot;sister school&quot; is Meriden School at Strathfield, an independent, Anglican, day school for girls. In 2018, Trinity Grammar School began integrating Meriden&#x27;s cadet unit into Trinity&#x27;s cadet unit.

== History ==
George Chambers , subsequently Bishop of Central Tanganyika, founded the School in 1913 at Dulwich Hill, of which parish - the Parish of Holy Trinity - he was then Rector. At its foundation, Trinity was a small parochial school with 29 boys enrolled. This number had reached 57 at the end of that year.

Having been appointed Warden of the School, Chambers&#x27; immediate task was to find a Headmaster. Thus, K.T. Henderson was appointed as the first Headmaster of Trinity Grammar in February 1913. In November 1915, the School formulated its motto, &quot;Detur Gloria Soli Deo&quot;, which may be translated from Latin to &quot;Let Glory be Given to God Alone&quot;. The School colours were chosen to reflect the liturgical season of Trinity, namely green.

A property known as &quot;The Towers&quot; was purchased by the parish and used both as a School and Rectory. Later a larger property, &quot;Hazeldene&quot;, was to be bought, also acting as both school and Rectory. The present site at Summer Hill, set in of land, was first occupied by the School in 1926, during the Head Mastership of G. E. Weeks.

By 1942 the prospects for Trinity were grim and it was decided that it should be closed. As a last attempt to save the School, the Council appointed James Wilson Hogg as Headmaster in 1944. By the time Wilson Hogg retired in 1974, Trinity was flourishing and had become one of the leading independent schools in NSW.

=== Milestones ===
*1988 – 75th anniversary of the whole school.
*2013 – Centenary of whole school and also 75th anniversary of the Preparatory school.

=== Trinity Grammar School Preparatory School ===

Sir Philip Sydney Jones was the original owner of the site on which the Preparatory School is now located. Upon his death, the area surrounding the house (including the house itself) was split into several areas which were then put up for auction. A small group of Strathfield residents first had the idea of using a portion of the grounds as a school, which became Strathfield Grammar School.

In 1926 it was offered to Trinity Grammar School and bought by them, but Strathfield Grammar School and Trinity Grammar School continued to function as separate establishments until 1932, when the two became Trinity Grammar School. From 1932 until 1937, most, if not all, of the teaching was done in Strathfield, although the school still used the Summer Hill Campus for sport. However, in 1938 the Senior School returned to Summer Hill and the Strathfield Campus for the first time became the Preparatory School.

The Preparatory School grounds are actually three separate properties - &quot;Milverton&quot;, &quot;Llandilo&quot; and &quot;Somerset.&quot; Milverton House was purchased by the school in 1966 and was used for educating &quot;Sub Primary&quot; or infants students. The most recent extension on &quot;Milverton&quot; was completed in 1991 and the building is now large enough to house the entire Infants department. Somerset was designed by Bertrand James Waterhouse and built in 1923 for James and Dorothy Larcombe (1900-1990). James Larcombe died in 1943 and his widow married Sir Percy Joske in 1969. Somerset was purchased by Trinity after the death of Lady Joske in 1990 and the Joske room, located on the edge of Somerset takes her name. &quot;Llandilo&quot; house is the largest of all the properties of the Preparatory School. Since its initial purchase in 1932 it has been the main building of Strathfield campus, providing education for the furthest advanced boys in the Primary curriculum. In 2005, a new sports and music centre was opened opposite &quot;Llandilo.&quot; This contains over 10 music studios, as well as several larger music rooms and an underground gym. This allowed all of the Primary School to finally be moved back into &quot;Llandilo,&quot; which had ceased to function properly with the sharp rise in student numbers before that date. In 2010, a new library was completed underneath the staff room, which has a connection to the &quot;Llandilo&quot; building.

Trinity Grammar School Preparatory School has grown extensively over the years, but the overall size of the property is much less than the original holdings of Sir Philip Sydney Jones.

=== Junior school ===
In 1946 the then Headmaster, Mr James Wilson Hogg, introduced a Junior School to the Summer Hill Campus and commenced with 36 boys in four classrooms. The Junior School, in various arrangements of classes and with up to 78 boys continued at Summer Hill until 1956, when all of the primary school boys were relocated to the Preparatory School at Strathfield.

In 2000 the Junior School was re-established by the Headmaster, Mr G. Milton Cujes, on the Summer Hill campus as a gesture of good faith to the families who had committed to the Southern Campus, a venture that until this date has not been realised. The Junior School recommenced with 72 boys in four classes from Year 3 to 6. The classes were located in temporary accommodation between No.1 Oval and No.3 Oval.

In 2002, the School Council determined that the Junior School would become a permanent part of the educational profile at the Summer Hill Campus for the foreseeable future.

In 2003 the Junior School moved to permanent accommodation in the old Boarding House, and was formally recommissioned in a ceremony whose guests included Messrs Neil Buckland and Neil Demeril, both of whom had been students at the Summer Hill Junior School in the 1940s.

In 2006, the Junior School expanded to include an Infants Campus, based in Lewisham, specifically for children from pre-school to Year 2 age. The site for this development was the land on which the St Thomas Beckett Primary School had been previously located. This portion of the school began with 12 students, and now has over 50 students.

Having received planning permission from Ashfield council, the School has proceeded to demolish several houses on Seaview Street, creating a space in which the new Junior School was to be built. Construction on the site concluded in later end of 2012 and the new Junior School was officially opened on 3 October 2012 by Robert Forsyth.
In 2013, Trinity started a preschool.

== Headmasters ==

The following individuals have served as Headmaster of the Trinity Grammar School:
== School Captains ==
== Campuses ==
The School consists of three separate but closely linked establishments:
* A Senior (Years 10 to 12) and Middle (Years 7 to 9) School for day students, as well as a Junior School (Kindergarten to Year 6), located at Summer Hill.
* Preparatory and pre kindergarten sections (Preschool to Year 6) at Strathfield.

Attempts were made in the early 2000s towards establishing a campus in Sydney&#x27;s southern suburbs. Such plans have been postponed indefinitely by the School. In 2014 the school decided to close the Outdoor Education Centre at the Pine Bluff Campus, located near Bigga, New South Wales due to the cost associated with maintaining the Outdoor Education Center in a remote location. The land that was used for the Outdoor Education Center was donated previously to the school by an old boy. In 2016 Trinity Grammar School opened a new Field Studies Centre in Woollamia, New South Wales.

== Facilities ==
The Trinity Grammar School senior campus is located in Summer Hill, and features a mix of old and new buildings and facilities.

Some current facilities of the school include:
*A quadrangle forms the centrepiece of the grounds, with a chapel;
*The Founders Building, containing a drama theatre, film and sound editing studios, interview rooms, staff common room, English department and the Arthur Holt Library;

==School song and prayer==

The school song is &quot;Detur Gloria Soli Deo&quot;, and is sung to the tune &quot;Stuttgart&quot; No.200 in the &quot;Australian Hymn Book&quot;
&lt;poem&gt;
Detur Gloria Soli deo,
Let the prayer triumphant ring;
Father, Son and Holy Spirit,
Trinity of thee we sing.

Trinitarians give the glory,
In a song of praise and joy;
For our School and her great story,
Glory give to God alone.

Students past and those now present,
Those the future years shall bring,
Detur Gloria Soli Deo,
This our own great anthem sing.
&lt;/poem&gt;
School Prayer
&lt;poem&gt;
Heavenly Father, we ask your blessing
Upon all those who work in and for this School.
Grant us faith to grow spiritually, strength
To grow bodily and wisdom to grow intellectually,
Through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Amen.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==House system==
Students at the Summer Hill campus are divided into sixteen houses, named after significant facets of the school&#x27;s history, the four original houses were Archer, Henderson, Hilliard and School. The 16 houses in Trinity Grammar School are Archer, Dulwich, Founders, Henderson, Hilliard, Holwood, Kerrigan, Latham, Murphy, School, Stephenson, Taubman, Weeks, Wilson Hogg, Wynn Jones and Young house. School House was reserved for boarders, although leading up to the closure of the boarding program in 2019 non-boarders were placed into this house to supplement the numbers. Boys are usually put into their family house, the same house as their father or grandfather or brother. Each house has a house captain and a maximum of three house vice-captains, with the majority of houses also having an unlimited number of prefects (students cannot be both a prefect and house captain).

Each year the different houses compete for the House Cup in a variety of activities such as swimming, track and field, touch football, indoor soccer, chess, debating, music, academic, cricket, fitness challenge, dodgeball, tug of war, drama performances and quad challenge. Through these activities houses are awarded points, and at the completion of the calendar year the house with the most points wins the cup, presented at the final assembly. In the case of significant victories, such as winning the swimming carnival or track and field, each house gives three cheers (in quick succession, clockwise around the quadrangle) for the victorious house, with the victorious house giving three final cheers for the school. These cheers are led by the house officers (often aided by prefects), who typically deliver the three cheers with as much volume as can be mustered.

Taubman House is the current house championship holder (2021), the current swimming champions are Archer House (2019) and the current track and field champion is Taubman House (2019).

===Senior school===
The senior school is divided into sixteen houses, as follows:

*Archer (Red)
*Dulwich (Sky Blue)
*Founders (Orange)
*Henderson (Gold)
*Hilliard (Purple)
*Holwood (Tan)
*Kerrigan (Lime Green)
*Latham (Black)

*Young (Maroon)
===Junior school===
The Junior School is divided into four houses, as follows;

*Taubman (White)
*Latham (Black) 
*Founders (Orange)
*Young (Maroon)
===Preparatory school===
The preparatory school is divided into four houses. These houses earn points towards the house cup, which is awarded at the prize giving each year. Competitions for houses include track and field, swimming, cricket, debating, rugby and academic. Each house is assigned a housemaster, who has responsibility for the direct organization of the pupils in their house. Most teachers are assigned a house, and although they have no day-to-day tasks relating to the house, they are used to provide additional control at house events. Unlike the house system at the senior school, the preparatory school houses do not have any direct impact on the academic or co-curricular aspects of the school. The houses are:

*Archer (Red)
*Henderson (Gold)
*Hilliard (Purple)
*School (Dark Blue)
===Former houses===
Old Junior School houses were;

*Dulwich (Sky Blue)
*Chambers [other name for Founders] (White)
*School (Dark Blue)
==Curriculum==
=== Preparatory School ===
In 2007, the Preparatory School adopted the Primary Years Program (PYP), which was developed by the International Baccalaureate Organisation (IBO) to provide Primary school students with a platform from which they can develop their education in preparation for the International Baccalaureate. This provides a separate program for learning, but this is the framework for the teaching of Maths, English, Computer Studies, Physical Education, Visual Arts and Music. Students learn Mandarin Chinese from Year 3, at the beginning of Primary School, and continue this up until the time they leave Preparatory School. The School is currently in the second phase of accreditation as a PYP school.

===Middle and Senior Schools===
Trinity offers both the NSW Higher School Certificate (HSC) and International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IB) for Year 11 and 12 students. Boys in the HSC and the IB, while being able to interact with each other through the House/Pastoral and Sport/Curriculum systems, are taught separately, due to the differing nature of the two curricula.

Despite its relative success, however, the IB Middle Years Program (MYP) has not been introduced into the Middle School. Both the PYP and the MYP are specifically designed for an introduction into the IB, and, due to the popularity of the IB among students, there is a chance that the MYP will be brought into the Middle School in years to come, although the School has neither confirmed nor denied this.

====Sport====
Trinity Grammar School is a member of the Combined Associated Schools (CAS), and through this association competes with other members of the CAS as well as Independent Schools Association and GPS member schools. Sporting activities offered include Australian rules football, basketball, chess, cricket, cross country, diving, fencing, football (soccer), golf, lawn bowls, rugby, snow sports, squash, swimming, table tennis, tennis, touch football, track and field (athletics), volleyball, and water polo.

==Controversies==
In 1971 a Trinity student sued the school and one of its masters, claiming that he had been caned excessively. Colin Morris, 15, said that his buttocks were sore for three days, and bruised for three weeks, after receiving six strokes of the cane. The judge threw the case out, saying that the punishment had been reasonable, and added, &quot;The salutary effect of the infliction of pain on a schoolboy, experience might show, justifies the reasonable use of this form of chastisement on healthy teenage boys.&quot;

Between 1984 and 1988, a senior school Mathematics teacher, Mr R. Doyle, was accused of sexually abusing two students who had been undertaking private tutoring with him on school grounds. Mr Doyle eventually pleaded guilty and was sentenced in 1997, long after his dismissal from the school.

In 2000, a group of Year 10 boarding students were charged with sexually assaulting two students more than 75 times, including with a collection of wooden dildos made in a woodwork class, one of which was called the &quot;Anaconda&quot;. Witnesses testified that the assaults often took place during lunch hour, and they &quot;often heard screaming from the dormitory&quot;. Three students were expelled by the school and convicted of various offences as minors. Compensation payments to two victims of bullying at the school are likely to have been approximately $1 million. It was alleged that the school had a culture of bullying A film loosely based on the incident, &quot;Boys Grammar&quot;, was produced in 2005. Academics now quote this case, and the school&#x27;s attempts to minimise public awareness and perceived damage to it, in studies in this area.

Trinity&#x27;s plan to bulldoze twelve of the seventeen houses it owns bordering the school grounds, in order to build a swimming pool, multi-purpose hall, classroom block and underground carpark, was approved by the NSW Land and Environment Court in November 2007. The single Ashfield Councillor who supported the application was an alumnus of the school, and described his fellow Councillors as &quot;envious&quot; and &quot;a pathetic bunch of people&quot;.

In January 2016, the school was brought to prominence as a result of allegations of &quot;sexualised behaviour&quot; that occurred at the conclusion of 2015, between Year 1 students of the school. The allegations involved sexual acts being performed by students, whilst unsupervised during school hours, in the school toilets and playground. The Department of Family and Community Services was brought in to investigate the matter after the school was contacted by a concerned parent of one of the alleged victims.

In January 2017, former teacher Neil Futcher was sentenced to 18 years and 4 months&#x27; jail, with a non-parole period of 11 years, for 22 child sex offences committed against six students between 1974 and 1981.

== Alumni ==
Alumni of Trinity Grammar School are known as Old Trinitarians and automatically gain membership members of the school&#x27;s Alumni Association, the Old Trinitarians Union. Through the Old Trinitarians Union, Old Boys regularly compete against current students in various sports such as cricket, volleyball and basketball, with the winner of the overall competition given the Jubilee Cup on Speech Day, with the President of the OTU collecting it on behalf of the old boys and the School Captain collecting it on behalf of the School.

<doc id="731576" wikidata="Q1145362" url="?curid=731576" title="Curt Weldon">
<text>Wayne Curtis Weldon (born July 22, 1947) is an American educator and politician. He served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 1987 to 2007, representing the 7th district of Pennsylvania. He was defeated in November 2006 for reelection by Joe Sestak. Weldon was vice-chair of the Armed Services Committee and the House Homeland Security Committee. He was also the co-chair of the Duma-Congress Study Group, the official inter-parliamentary relationship between the United States and Russia.

== Early life and education ==
Weldon grew up in a blue-collar family in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania. He was the youngest of nine children. He attended West Chester University of Pennsylvania and earned a B.A. in Russian studies in 1969, making him the first in his family to graduate from college. At West Chester University, Weldon became a brother of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.

After graduation, Weldon was subject to the draft, with the Vietnam War ongoing. In November 2000, his office said he used student and teaching deferments during the Vietnam era, and had a low number when the draft lottery was reinstated. In July 2006, a Weldon spokesman said that Weldon &quot;wanted to serve, but the military would not take him because of his extremely poor eyesight.&quot;

== Early political career ==

Weldon wasn&#x27;t active in politics until 1977, when he became the Mayor of Marcus Hook. Prior to that, he served as an educator in local Delaware County schools, and for the Insurance Company of North America, as well as a volunteer line officer chief for the Viscose Fire Company in Marcus Hook.

Weldon served two terms as Mayor from 1977 to 1982 and was nominated for election on both the Republican and Democratic tickets. His efforts as mayor were geared towards defending the town against the violent Pagans Motorcycle Gang.

From 1981 to 1986, Weldon served as a councilman and later chair of the Delaware County Council. Maintaining his interest in foreign affairs, he coordinated a USSR student exchange program in 1985 that continues to this day.

==Congressional campaigns==
=== 1984–2004 ===
Weldon first ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for the 7th district of Pennsylvania in 1984 on the Republican ticket, losing to incumbent Democrat Robert W. Edgar by just 412 votes even as Ronald Reagan carried the district by over 20 points. However, Edgar did not seek re-election in 1986 but instead ran for the U.S. Senate against Arlen Specter. Weldon then ran again for Edgar&#x27;s seat in 1986 and won with a comfortable margin.

Weldon&#x27;s margin for re-election grew considerably since 1986, handily defeating Democratic opponents even as Delaware County, once a classic Rockefeller Republican bastion, became friendlier to Democrats at the national level. In 2000, for instance, he was re-elected with 65% of the vote even though Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore won Delaware County with 54% of the vote.

In 2004, Weldon won with 59% of the vote. By contrast, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry got 53% of the district&#x27;s vote that year. Weldon&#x27;s Democratic opponent, Paul Scoles, spent $24,000 running against the nine-term incumbent; in that 2003–2004 election cycle, Weldon received nearly $900,000 in campaign contributions. Scoles entered the race in the last 90 days of the campaign, when the original Democratic candidate, Greg Philips, was called up for Reserve duty to support the Iraq War.

=== 2006 ===
Weldon&#x27;s Democratic opponent in 2006 was Joe Sestak, a Vice-Admiral who retired earlier in the year after a 31-year military career. According to the &quot;Delaware County Daily Times&quot;, Sestak proved to be a capable fundraiser and had raised more money than Weldon.

In July, CQPolitics changed their rating on the race from &quot;Republican Favored&quot; to the more competitive &quot;Leans Republican.&quot; On October 13, 2006, CQPolitics once again changed their rating on the race, from &quot;Leans Republican&quot; to &quot;No Clear Favorite.&quot;

On October 26, 2006, &quot;American Prospect&quot; magazine reported that e-mails recently had been forwarded to the Justice Department that describe alleged efforts by official members of Weldon&#x27;s staff to call Navy employees for information and negative statements about Democratic opponent Sestak. In one Pentagon email, Weldon&#x27;s office is described as &quot;calling everyone and his brother&quot; in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) about Sestak.

On October 27, 2006, the advocacy group Campaign for America&#x27;s Future began running advertisements in Pennsylvania&#x27;s 7th District questioning $233,840 in campaign contributions Weldon received from drug and insurance companies, in light of his voting history.

On November 7, 2006, Weldon lost the general election, taking 44% of the vote to Sestak&#x27;s 56%.

==Actions in Congress==

Weldon&#x27;s moderately conservative voting record (lifetime ACU rank: 69.9)) reflected the overwhelming Republican voter registration in Delaware County, which has varied from a low of about 62% to about 70% of registered voters 1998–2006. His voting record was slightly more conservative than the entire Pennsylvania Congressional delegation; Weldon&#x27;s 2006 ACU rank was 68 vs. the average 2006 ACU rank of 57 for all 19 PA Congressmen.

=== Domestic issues ===
Weldon founded the Congressional Fire Services Caucus in 1987 and has consistently fought for increased funding for firefighters. He was the author of a bill that implemented a federal grant program for local fire departments that evolved into the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program. He has fought for mandatory safety sprinklers in college dormitories and training of fire departments to deal with terrorism incidents involving chemical and biological weapons. At times, his alleged pork barrel spending was challenged by fiscal conservatives such as Arizona Congressman Jeff Flake; Weldon once told Flake, &quot;Doggone it, I&#x27;m not gonna let somebody stand up here in total and complete ignorance and spout off a bunch of gobbledygook. Don&#x27;t stand up on the floor and make stupid allegations because you want a headline about cutting waste. This is not waste.&quot;

Weldon co-chaired the House Oceans Caucus. In 1995, his &quot;Oceans Agenda&quot; legislation passed Congress, increasing funding for oceanographic research projects. Weldon was the sole House Republican on the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, which approves funding for U.S. wildlife refuges and wetlands preservation. Weldon is a member of Global Legislators for a Balanced Environment (GLOBE), where he serves as Honorary Chairman of the Oceans Protection Task Force. Weldon also serves as the honorary United States Vice President on the Advisory Committee on the Protection of the Sea (ACOPS). In his district, Weldon secured funding for the John Heinz Wildlife Refuge in Tinicum and obtained funding for the preservation of the Paoli Battlefield, the site of a Revolutionary War battle that was slated for development.

Weldon also co-authored the Family Medical Leave Act, pushed for the extension of unemployment benefits, has consistently supported raising the minimum wage, opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement, and voted for across-the-board tax cuts. He also played a key leadership role in welfare reform in the mid-1990s.

=== Foreign policy ===
In 1993, Weldon and Bob Dole, among other Republicans, advocated pulling out of Somalia after the &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; failed snatch and grab mission of Mohamed Farrah Aidid cost 18 American dead.

==== Russia and China ====
In June 1998, Weldon served on the Select Committee on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People&#x27;s Republic of China, perhaps better known as the &quot;Cox Committee.&quot; The committee, five Republicans and four Democrats, investigated whether the Clinton Administration&#x27;s waivers allowing U.S. military contractors to transfer military technology to China damaged national security. According to officials who have been briefed about its contents, the report concludes that Beijing&#x27;s acquisition of secret American weapons designs was part of an intelligence collection effort that spanned 20 years, including both Republican and Democratic Administrations. It also enumerates an array of thefts from the Government&#x27;s weapons labs, including classified information about seven advanced nuclear warheads, among them the W-88, the most sophisticated nuclear weapon in the American arsenal; that theft is believed to have occurred during the Reagan or Bush Administrations. The report also says that China stole design information about the neutron bomb.

Weldon made improving relations with Russia one of his key efforts in the House. He has worked with Russian leaders on a variety of issues, including efforts to improve Russia&#x27;s energy supply, correct environmental damage and protect both nations from ballistic missile attack. Weldon is the co-founder of the Duma-Congress Study Group, the official parliamentary exchange between the two legislative bodies. This bilateral relationship coordinates legislative efforts in the Russian Duma and the Congress to foster a better working relationship between the two nations. Recently, Weldon created a comprehensive framework designed to improve the state of relations between the two countries. Titled &quot;A New Time, A New Beginning&quot;, his proposal makes recommendations for cooperative efforts in eleven different areas ranging from defense and national security to space exploration and scientific research.

====Visits to North Korea====
In June 2003, Weldon lead a bipartisan Congressional delegation to North Korea. The delegation didn&#x27;t go as official representatives of the White House, which had repeatedly refused North Korea&#x27;s demands that the two countries meet one-on-one. The White House did know the trip was planned and did supply a military helicopter.

Weldon said that the meetings went extremely well. Weldon said he drew up an outline of how relations could be improved between the two countries, which would involve the complete nuclear disarmament of North Korea. North Korean leaders, including the vice-foreign minister who is the chief negotiator for the North, were receptive to the concept, said Weldon.

In October 2003, Weldon had planned to head a 10-member Congressional delegation to North Korea for his second visit. But two days prior to the October 25 departure date, White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card informed Weldon that the administration was &quot;pulling all support.&quot; Weldon then wrote a 4½-page letter to President George W. Bush that said that Bush&#x27;s national security team was &quot;arrogant and disrespectful&quot; in the way it cancelled the trip. Weldon said he would continue his efforts to dialogue with North Korean officials whether the White House supports him or not. &quot;They can&#x27;t stop me from going there&quot;, he said. &quot;What they can do is make things supremely difficult.&quot;

In January 2005, Weldon led a six-member Congressional delegation in a three-day visit to North Korea, as well as brief stops in South Korea, China, Russia and Japan. Weldon said Pyongyang was serious about abandoning its nuclear program, but he said it wanted certain assurances from the United States — the main one being that an end to what he called &quot;inflammatory rhetoric&quot; from Washington.

In August 2005, Weldon went to North Korea as part of a 10-member delegation that included Ted Turner and former U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Donald Gregg.

====Visits to Libya====
In 2004, Weldon led two bipartisan delegations to Libya. The first visit, in January, was to establish contact with government officials. The second visit, in September, was to address their Congress (Libyan General People&#x27;s Congress Great Jamahiriya).

A large picture of Weldon putting what his office said was an American flag pin on Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi, the head of Libya, was displayed when Weldon spoke at the Sun Myung Moon coronation ceremony.

In 2011, Weldon again visited the Gaddafi-controlled Libyan capital of Tripoli as a private citizen, on the invitation of Colonel Gaddafi. He is urging Colonel Gaddafi to step down due to bloodshed in the 2011 Libyan civil war. He currently is waiting to meet with Gaddafi, although he has met with several high-level members of Gaddafi&#x27;s government.

====Iraq, Iran, and terrorism====
Weldon has frequently taken contrarian positions on such subjects as Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden, and pre-war Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. He has been critical of several federal agencies and of Congressional committees.

In October 2005, Weldon gave a speech on the House floor in which he described the Able Danger military intelligence program, stating they correctly identified Mohamed Atta&#x27;s Brooklyn cell in January and February 2000, a year prior to the attacks. He also claimed they were repeatedly blocked by litigation from delivering their findings to the FBI in September 2000.

===== Iranian informer =====
In mid-2005, Weldon&#x27;s book, &quot;Countdown to Terror: The Top-Secret Information that Could Prevent the Next Terrorist Attack on America ... and How the CIA Has Ignored It&quot;, was published. In it, he accuses the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and his colleagues on the House and Senate intelligence committees of ignoring his trove of information. These secrets, he says, come from &quot;an impeccable clandestine source&quot;, whom Weldon code-names &quot;Ali&quot;, an Iranian exile living in Paris. Much of the book consists of reproduced pages of &quot;intelligence&quot; memos faxed by Ali to Weldon&#x27;s office between 2003 and 2004.

According to the book, Iranian-supported terrorists were plotting to fly a hijacked Canadian airliner into the Seabrook Nuclear Power Station, 40 miles outside Boston. The book also said that Iran was hiding Osama bin Laden.

&quot;Ali&quot; was identified in April 2005 as Fereidoun Mahdavi, a frail, elderly former minister of commerce in the government of the Shah of Iran. Mahdavi has said that the bulk of the information that he provided to Weldon originally came from Iran-Contra arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar.

The CIA and former intelligence officers vehemently dispute Weldon&#x27;s charges. Bill Murray, the former CIA station chief in Paris, said that, after interviewing Mahdavi on several occasions and investigating his claims, the CIA determined he was lying. The CIA says that Mahdavi never gave them anything specific about Iran&#x27;s weapons capability or terrorist activities. As for Ghorbanifar, he is the subject of a rare CIA &quot;burn notice&quot; after the agency found him to be a &quot;fabricator&quot; during the Iran-Contra affair.

=====Hidden weapons of mass destruction =====
Dave Gaubatz, a former Air Force special investigator who was as a civilian employee in Iraq in 2003, says that while in Iraq, he acquired what he considered reliable information about WMD caches in four locations that had gas and chemical weapons that were recently produced. He could not get U.S. military officials to look into the matter, so he eventually contacted Weldon and Representative Peter Hoekstra, head of the House Intelligence Committee, to share his information and to try to get them to pressure the Defense Department and intelligence agencies to do the WMD searches in four locales.

Instead, Gaubatz said, Weldon discussed a Hoekstra-Weldon trip to Iraq, under the guise of visiting the troops, that would detour to one of the locales. Once there, Gaubatz said, the congressmen planned to persuade the U.S. military commander to lend them the equipment and men to go digging for the cache. He said that Weldon made it clear he didn&#x27;t want word leaked to the Pentagon, to intelligence officials, or to Democratic congressmen.

Gaubatz said that &quot;They even worked out how it would go. If there was nothing there, nothing would be said. If the site had been [scavenged], nothing would be said. But, if it was still there, they would bring the press corps out.&quot; After a May 4, 2006 meeting, according to Gaubatz, he called a reporter at &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, who called Weldon&#x27;s office to get confirmation. That inquiry, Gaubatz said, scuttled the project.

A spokesman for Hoekstra denied that Hoekstra intended to take an expedition to Iraq. Weldon&#x27;s office refused to comment.

===March 2004 coronation===
Weldon was one of six &quot;Congressional Co-Chairs&quot; for a Sun Myung Moon event on March 23, 2004, in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, which was described in the invitation as being for the &quot;Interreligious and International Peace Council.&quot; The IIPC is a program of the Universal Peace Federation. Weldon&#x27;s office initially denied that he attended the event and when shown the invitation showing him as a cosponsor said that he had been unable to attend the event. They retracted those claims upon being shown photos proving his attendance, claiming that his participation was &quot;limited to his attendance.&quot; Investigative reporter John Gorenfeld then found a photo depicting Weldon as giving the opening &quot;congratulatory remarks&quot; from the stage. Weldon gave a speech about his recent trip to Libya in front of a photo of him pinning an award on Muammar al-Gaddafi. A spokesman for Weldon then said he &quot;was not there for the crowning&quot; and that &quot;If we had known that Reverend Moon was going to attend the event, be crowned and make an unbelievably interesting speech, the congressman likely would not have attended.&quot;

==Controversies==
===2006 Investigation===
In 2006 Weldon faced investigation by the Justice Department&#x27;s Public Integrity Section for suspected unlawful ties to two Russian companies and two Serbian citizens, when in a filing with the Federal Election Commission Weldon&#x27;s campaign committee reported that it transferred $70,000 to the &quot;Weldon Legal Expense Trust&quot;. When reports surfaced of this in September 2006, Russ Caso, Weldon&#x27;s chief of staff, said that the congressman and his staff were unaware of any investigation.

The FBI and Justice Department&#x27;s investigations were triggered by a 2004 article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporting on Weldon and his daughter&#x27;s links to the Russians and Serbians. On October 16, 2006, FBI agents raided the home of Weldon&#x27;s daughter as well as five other locations of Weldon associates in Pennsylvania and Florida as part of the investigation. According to an article in the October 17, 2006, edition of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;investigators are trying to determine whether Mr. Weldon misused his official position to help his daughter&#x27;s company obtain lobbying contracts from foreign clients and helped steer contracts to favored firms.&quot; On October 16, 2006, Weldon acknowledged he was under investigation. Before Weldon&#x27;s public confirmation, an unnamed federal law enforcement official mentioned in press accounts said that Weldon had not yet been told about the inquiry.

A grand jury was impaneled as part of the investigation. Evidence reportedly had been obtained through wiretaps of Washington area cellphones. On October 19, 2006, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; reported that Weldon has in his possession a letter from the House Ethics Committee that he claims &quot;closed the case&quot; about whether he used his influence to help his daughter. Weldon said he has not decided whether or not to release the letter. Although emails from the Weldon campaign quoted by the &quot;Inquirer&quot; claim the Ethics panel &quot;closed the case in 2004&quot;, the article reveals the matter was not dismissed until September 29, 2006. The Ethics Committee action is not binding on the Department of Justice investigation.

On December 22, 2006, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that a federal grand jury had subpoenaed Weldon&#x27;s congressional records prior to the November elections. Because a member must notify House leadership promptly if they receive subpoenas while the House is in session to be entered into the Congressional Record, Weldon may have violated House rules depending on when he received the subpoenas. On July 17, 2007, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that, as of Spring 2007, federal investigators were continuing to examine Weldon&#x27;s official actions taken on behalf of his daughter&#x27;s lobbying clients. The same article noted that Weldon had spent at least $30,000 in legal fees and related investigatory expenses as a result of the probe.

Weldon was never charged in the incident, however the &quot;USA Today&quot; claimed in 2008 that the incident had cost him his re-election.

===Lobbying controversies===
In September 2006, the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) released its second annual report on members of Congress with ethics issues, titled &quot;Beyond DeLay: The 20 Most Corrupt Members of Congress (and five to watch)&quot;. Weldon was one of the 20. The organization said &quot;His ethics issues stem from using his position to financially benefit his children and a family friend.&quot;

In response, Weldon spokesman Michael Puppio said there is &quot;nothing illegal or improper about any of the actions mentioned&quot; in the CREW report. He said the organization is a &quot;front group for liberal Democrats who have a partisan ax to grind against Republicans.&quot;

In January 2006, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Cecilia Grimes, 40, who calls herself a longtime family friend of Weldon, was the senior partner in a two-person lobbying firm located in Media, Pennsylvania, where she is realtor. The lobbying firm has clients from as far away as California with business that involves one or both of the House committees that Weldon is a member of.

Grimes told the Times she has known Weldon for about 15 years. &quot;I coached one of his kids in junior high school&quot;, she said, declining to elaborate. In 2000, she was his real estate agent in the purchase of a house in Pennsylvania. She has been lobbying since March 2003, when she opened a firm called CC Nexus LLC — now incorporated as Grimes and Young. Grimes&#x27; partner is Cynthia Young, 28, a lawyer who lives two houses from Weldon. Her husband, Robert J. Young, worked as a paid staff aide for four months on Weldon&#x27;s 2004 re-election campaign. He is the son of U.S. Representative Bill Young (R-FL).

Grimes has signed up at least eight corporate clients, four of which are located in Weldon&#x27;s district. The companies are mostly small firms seeking federal defense and domestic security funding. Among the most recent clients signed by Grimes and Young is Oto Melara, a subsidiary of Italian defense company Finmeccanica, the firm that employs Kim Weldon. On June 1, 2005, the company agreed to pay Grimes $20,000 annually. Grimes was put in touch with Oto Melara by Weldon&#x27;s chief of staff, Russ Caso. But, Grimes said in an interview, her employment was not because of Weldon. &quot;That&#x27;s ridiculous&quot;, she said.

Another client is Advanced Ceramics Research Inc., a Tucson, Arizona firm. Grimes lobbied about a dozen members of Congress, including Weldon, for a $3 million contract in 2005, which became the firm&#x27;s first funding from a defense appropriations bill. The firm has since won a combined $43.5 million in Navy contracts and congressional funding. More than $5 million came from the Naval Air Systems Command, an agency overseen by Weldon&#x27;s subcommittee.

Grimes said that despite a lack of Washington experience, she has skills for lobbying. &quot;It&#x27;s all about networking and follow-up&quot;, she said. &quot;My clients like my company, and that has nothing to do with Curt.&quot;

An additional lobbyist Stefanie Reiser worked from January 2000 to late 2005 for Weldon, handling fund-raising duties for Weldon&#x27;s campaign committee and for his political action committee, Committee for a United Republican Team (CURT PAC). She earned $54,659 as a fundraiser for Weldon&#x27;s campaign committee, and was paid at least $90,000 by CURT PAC for fundraising and reimbursements for travel, lodging and office supplies.

Prior to working for Weldon, Reiser was a lobbyist for Chambers Associates and served as former California Governor Pete Wilson&#x27;s representative in Washington. She registered as a lobbyist for Novavax, Inc., a company seeking federal funding for a vaccine, on November 13, 2001; the company paid her $20,000. On December 6, 2001, Weldon and three other members of Congress held a briefing in which they and researchers from Novavax spoke of the need for a vaccine similar to the one Novavax was working on. On December 24, 2001, Reiser donated $250 to Curt PAC, describing herself as &quot;Self-employed/political fundraiser&quot;.

=== Use of campaign funds ===
Between 1998 and 2006, Weldon spent about $80,000 of campaign treasury funds on restaurant meals. During the same period, Weldon also spent about $30,000 of campaign funds on hotels. He also spent $1,698 for a personal computer, delivered to his home; $4,618 for landscaping, paid to a company owned by a campaign contributor; and $13,000 in unitemized personal reimbursements during that period.

Congressional ethics rules say that campaign funds should be used for &quot;bona fide campaign or political purposes&quot;. Weldon&#x27;s attorney, William B. Canfield, said that ethics rules are &quot;entirely amorphous&quot;, and that &quot;you may think it&#x27;s a big loophole, but he&#x27;s allowed to spend money that way.&quot;

=== Conviction of former aide ===
In December 2007, a former Weldon aide pleaded guilty for failing to report $19,000 in income that his wife made for doing work for a nonprofit company tied to Weldon.

== Post-Congressional career ==
After his election defeat in November 2006, Weldon joined Defense Solutions, headquartered in Exton, Pennsylvania, as the company&#x27;s chief strategic officer.

Additionally, Weldon joined the advisory board of Novo Energies Corporation, an alternative energy company converting used tires and plastic into energy.

<text>Heather Elizabeth Langenkamp (born July 17, 1964) is an American actress, director, writer, producer, and disc jockey. Langenkamp played Nancy Thompson in Wes Craven&#x27;s slasher film &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; (1984), which earned her recognition as a scream queen and in popular culture. She reprised the role in &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot; (1987) and played a fictionalized version of herself in the meta film &quot;Wes Craven&#x27;s New Nightmare&quot; (1994). In 1995, she was inducted into the Fangoria Chainsaw Hall of Fame.

Langenkamp was born and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma. She appeared as an extra in the Francis Ford Coppola productions &quot;The Outsiders&quot; (1983) and &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; (1983), and had a leading role in the little-seen &quot;Nickel Mountain&quot; (1984). Asides from her &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; appearances, she is also known for starring in the sitcoms &quot;Growing Pains&quot; (1988-1990) and &quot;Just the Ten of Us&quot; (1988-1990). Langenkamp experienced an acting resurgence after being cast as Dr. Georgina Stanton in Mike Flanagan&#x27;s &quot;The Midnight Club&quot; (2022), then starred in Flanagan&#x27;s drama film &quot;The Life of Chuck&quot; (2024) and Spider One&#x27;s horror film &quot;Little Bites&quot; (2024).

Langenkamp runs AFX Studio with her second husband David LeRoy Anderson, where she has worked as a special make-up effects coordinator for films such as &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; (2004), &quot;Cinderella Man&quot; (2005), &quot;Evan Almighty&quot; (2007), and &quot;The Cabin in the Woods&quot; (2012). She has worked on two documentaries about her experiences with the &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; franchise: executive producing and narrating &quot;Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy&quot; (2010), and starring in and producing &quot;I Am Nancy&quot; (2011). She has been a disc jockey for the Malibu radio station KBUU-LP since the 2010s, going under the pseudonym Sandy Bottoms. She wrote and directed the short film &quot;Washed Away&quot; (2019).

==Early life==
Heather Elizabeth Langenkamp was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Her mother, Mary Alice (née Myers), is an artist and an abstract expressionist painter. Her father, Robert Dobie Langenkamp, was a petroleum attorney and a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Energy. She later moved to Washington, DC, where she attended the National Cathedral School for Girls, graduating in 1982.

== Career ==
===&quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; franchise and television stardom===
At age eighteen, Langenkamp worked for the &quot;Tulsa Tribune&quot; where she saw an advertisement looking for extras for Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Outsiders&quot; in the summer of 1982. Auditions occurred at a nearby elementary school where the casting director took a Polaroid of her; Langenkamp got a call back to appear in a high school scene, in which she had to wear attire based on 1950s fashion. Coppola was shooting another film in Tulsa the same summer, &quot;Rumble Fish&quot;, after &quot;The Outsiders&quot;; Langenkamp&#x27;s friend got a phone call to appear in a street scene, and her friend&#x27;s mother felt more comfortable with Langenkamp going with her to the set at night. The casting director allowed her to join and gave dialogue to Langenkamp—in which she did several takes of her saying dialogue to Matt Dillon&#x27;s character; &quot;The Outsiders&quot; and &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; did not include her scenes but helped her get into the Screen Actors Guild. These positive experiences made Langenkamp feel like she should attempt to pursue an acting career in Hollywood.

While studying at Stanford University, she would travel to Los Angeles on the weekends to pursue auditions, where she had her first official Hollywood audition for Drew Denbaum&#x27;s independent drama film &quot;Nickel Mountain&quot; (1984). While auditioning, her rented car got hit by a runaway truck on Cahuenga Boulevard. Denbaum and the casting director helped Langenkamp during the ordeal. She bonded with them and got cast in the lead role of Callie Wells. She has expressed regret for doing the nude scene as she feared voicing her discomfort while filming—as she was an up-and-coming actress. Her next role was Beth, the daughter of Joanne Woodward and Richard Crenna&#x27;s characters in the CBS television film &quot;Passions&quot; (1984). The direction towards her character received praise. Langenkamp reflects, &quot;It was a complex part. Richard plays a philandering husband who has a son with his mistress, so my character was acting like a bridge between these two families.&quot;

Langenkamp became aware of auditions for a horror film known as &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; (1984) at the end of 1983. Casting director Annette Benson was familiar to Langenkamp as she had brought her in to read for the lead role in &quot;Night of the Comet&quot; (1984); the part ultimately went to Catherine Mary Stewart. She auditioned for the highly sought after role of fifteen-year-old heroine Nancy. There were not enough chairs to accommodate the number of actresses auditioning. Craven stated that he wanted someone very &quot;non-Hollywood&quot; and someone who embodied the &quot;all-American, girl-next-door&quot; for the role and believed that Langenkamp had these qualities. Craven informed her that she got the part in January 1984. She beat out more than 200 actresses auditioning for the part. She won the Best Actress Award at the Avoriaz Film Festival for her role as Nancy, and &quot;Empire&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;Heather Langenkamp [is] an appealing high school lead.&quot; She was then established as a scream queen. Later that year, she starred in the music video for ZZ Top&#x27;s &quot;Sleeping Bag&quot;.

In 1986, she guest-starred in &quot;CBS Schoolbreak Special&quot; and &quot;ABC Afterschool Specials&quot; before being cast in &quot;Suburban Beat&quot; (1985), a television pilot that did not get picked up, where she played Hope Sherman, the youngest housewife. Craven approached Langenkamp to reprise her role of Nancy in the sequel &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot; (1987), about the survivors of Freddy Krueger&#x27;s previous attempts; it opened to box office success in 1987 grossing over $44 million. Later, she had a guest appearance as Tracy in the television series &quot;The New Adventures of Beans Baxter&quot; and Monica on the soap opera &quot;Hotel&quot; (both in 1987). Langenkamp obtained further recognition when she portrayed lead character Marie Lubbock on the ABC television series &quot;Just the Ten of Us&quot;, a spin-off of the popular ABC situation comedy &quot;Growing Pains&quot; (on which she guest-starred), from 1988 to 1990. Langenkamp had a cameo role as a victim in Craven&#x27;s horror film &quot;Shocker&quot; (1989). Langenkamp portrayed the figure skater Nancy Kerrigan in the NBC television film &quot;Tonya &amp; Nancy: The Inside Story&quot;, released in 1994, which focused on Tonya Harding&#x27;s husband&#x27;s attack. 

Langenkamp returned to the &quot;Elm Street&quot; franchise with &quot;Wes Craven&#x27;s New Nightmare&quot;, which is a standalone film, and follows the journey Freddy Krueger takes to the real world. She instead starred as a fictionalized version of herself, based on a stalking incident she was subject to that involved a fan angry over the cancellation of her show, &quot;Just the Ten of Us&quot;. On the film, Langenkamp stated &quot;It&#x27;s a really interesting concept, and it&#x27;s one of the only horror movies where the monster&#x27;s really in the background, at least until the end. But it&#x27;s all about our mentality about fear.&quot; It was released in 1994, and opened to critical praise, being cited as an influential &quot;metahorror&quot; film. Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; stated that she &quot;proves she is still one of cinema’s most resourceful scream queens here.&quot; Langenkamp starred in Robert Kurtzman&#x27;s low-budget superhero film &quot;The Demolitionist&quot; (1995). In 1997, she portrayed Lou Ann Solomon in one episode of the short-lived science fiction/horror television series &quot;Perversions of Science&quot;. She later starred in the direct-to-video film &quot;Fugitive Mind&quot; (1999).

=== Collaborations with Mike Flanagan and acting comeback ===
Langenkamp started the 2020s with roles in voice acting, providing a voice role an episode of the Cartoon Network adult animated horror comedy &quot;JJ Villard&#x27;s Fairy Tales&quot; (2020) and the voices of Dazzle Feather, Mayflower, and a confused mother in the animated adventure film &quot;My Little Pony: A New Generation&quot; (2021). On February 1, 2021, reports confirmed Langenkamp as being a cast member in Mike Flanagan and Leah Fong&#x27;s 10-episode Netflix horror mystery-thriller series &quot;The Midnight Club&quot; (2022); an adaptation of Christopher Pike&#x27;s 1994 novel of the same name as well as various other Pike novels. Langenkamp portrays Dr. Georgina Stanton, an enigmatic doctor who runs Brightcliffe Hospice, the primary setting of the series. The series premiered on October 7, 2022.

Langenkamp will have a supporting role as Ellenor in Spider One&#x27;s upcoming horror film &quot;Little Bites&quot;, which is executive-produced by Cher and Chaz Bono. Speaking of her character&#x27;s role in the film: &quot;I really responded to the way my character, Ellenor, thrusts Spider’s terrifying story in a new direction. I love that I get to deliver a kind of wisdom that older women often carry with them and are mysteriously duty-bound to pass along.&quot;

==Personal life==
Langenkamp&#x27;s first husband was musician Alan Pasqua, from 1984 until 1987.

<doc id="731608" wikidata="Q964197" url="?curid=731608" title="Mazda Capella">
<text>The Mazda Capella, also known as the 626 in Europe, North America and Southeast Asia, is a mid-size car that was manufactured by Mazda from 1970 until 2002. Sold in the Japanese domestic market under the Capella name, the vehicle was also commonly known in other major markets as the Mazda 626. Ford, Mazda&#x27;s partner at the time, also used the Capella platform to create the Ford Telstar and Ford Probe. 4,345,279 of the 626 and Telstar models were sold worldwide.

Designed to compete against Japanese mid-size stalwarts such as the Honda Accord, Toyota Corona, and Nissan Bluebird, the Capella was succeeded by the Mazda6 (Atenza) in 2002.

The car was named after Capella, the brightest star in the constellation Auriga, the sixth-brightest in the night sky and the third-brightest in the northern celestial hemisphere, after Arcturus and Vega.

== First generation (1970–1978) ==
The first Capella was introduced in May 1970 and lasted until 1978, and was introduced as an intermediate alternative to the smaller Mazda Familia and the larger Mazda Luce. It was powered by four-cylinder SOHC valve engines displacing either 1.5 or 1.6 litres. Output is , respectively; and of torque for the larger displacement version. The first models all had rectangular headlights, while the rotary-engined models received round twin headlamps beginning in October 1971. From 1972 all models received the double headlamps. The taillight design was changed repeatedly over the production run. This generation was sold in export markets as the Mazda 616 in sedan and, for some markets, coupé configurations. There was also a Mazda 618 briefly sold in the United States.

An optional Mazda Wankel engine was offered and known as the Capella Rotary in Japan or the Mazda RX-2 for export. In addition to the 1.6, a Capella 1500 was added in October 1970. The Capella received a fairly thorough facelift in February 1974. This facelift included a restyled front end (lengthened by 110 mm) and a redesigned dashboard. This model received an optional 1.8-litre (1769 cc) engine for some markets and in Japan it was sold with the &quot;AP&quot; suffix, for &quot;Anti-Pollution&quot;. The 1500 was no longer available. The facelift rotary version received the CB12S chassis code rather than S122A.

In Japan, the installation of a rotary engine gave Japanese buyers a financial advantage when it came time to pay the annual road tax in that they bought a car that was more powerful than a traditional inline engine, but without having the penalty for having an engine in the higher 1.5-litre tax bracket. This was the only generation that had the rotary engine offered.

The RX-2 was assembled under contract in New Zealand from 1972 for Mazda New Zealand by Motor Industries International in Otahuhu, South Auckland. It was the first and only rotary-engined car ever to be assembled in the country and was made as both a sedan, with manual or automatic transmission and a manual-only coupé. The 616 was also built but was much less popular. In South Africa, where the Capella was assembled first by Illings and then by Sigma, it was available with the 1600 or 1800 reciprocal engines as well as the rotary. The rotary claimed SAE in South Africa. The facelift version arrived two years late there, in mid-1976. At the end of that year, the Capella RS was introduced—this lowered version with Rostyle wheels was limited to 20 cars per month. South African production of the Capella Rotary continued into 1979, since Sigma had taken the decision not to build the second-generation Capella there but to focus on the Colt Galant instead.

The Mazda 616 was a major component of Mazda&#x27;s United States expansion in 1971, having been preceded by its rotary brother, the RX-2, the previous year. It featured the 1.6-litre (1586 cc) engine, which was later used in the 808. The American Capella was updated and renamed the next year: the 1972 Mazda 618 had a larger 1.8-litre (1796 cc) &quot;VB&quot; engine which was only used in the US and not related to the similarly sized &quot;VC&quot; used in the rest of the world. Lasting just one year, the 618 nameplate was not used again in the United States and the only federalized version of the Capella for 1973 was the RX-2.


== Second generation (CB; 1978–1982) ==

The second-generation rear-wheel drive Capella was available between October 1977 and 1982, in both sedan and coupé forms. It was known on export markets as the 626, with the exception of the United Kingdom, where the vehicle was called the Mazda Montrose, the name being changed to honor the local Mazda dealership in Montrose. The Montrose was offered as an alternative to the Ford Cortina, which was popular at the time. It was released in 1978, although the model&#x27;s introduction to most markets was delayed until 1979. Early models had two slightly different frontal treatments. Models equipped with 1.6 or 1.8-litre engines came with a more pronounced sloping grille and models with the 2-litre engine came with a more flush grille. A bolder front and rear facelift, though similar in appearance, was carried out in September 1980 but this model was not sold in the UK, where the Montrose&#x27;s styling remained unchanged. It was, however, offered in the rest of Europe and this and later generations were particularly popular in Germany. This Capella was designed with more concern for aerodynamics and achieved a Cx value of 0.38.

The coupé and sedan were mechanically identical, with front MacPherson struts and a coil sprung solid axle at the back mounted on four links with a transverse Panhard rod providing addition location. Either a five-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmission and recirculating ball steering completed the mechanical specification. The CB also featured a split-folding rear seat. In Japan, the Capella came with 1.6-, 1.8-, or 2.0-litre engines (the 2.0 only being introduced in the end of March 1979). All had twin-barrel carburettors and produced 90, 100, and 110 PS JIS (66, 74, or 81 kW). The higher equipped versions received the larger US bumpers and were thus somewhat longer overall.

The Mazda 626 badge was used for the first time in some markets, replacing the earlier &quot;616&quot;. The 626 was typically fitted with the 1.6- or 2.0-litre version of the Mazda F/MA, which produced from , though only the 2.0-litre was available in the United States. The 626 was facelifted in November 1980, with the update bringing flush-fitting headlamps and a new grille insert. Other changes included redesigned tail-lights, a revised dash, new trim and improved dynamics. The grille was lengthened slightly to remove the body-coloured gap between the headlamps and grille on the original model. It was also reduced in height so that the grille and headlamps formed a single &quot;band&quot; across the front-end.

In the United States, the facelift appeared for the 1981 model year and meant more black trim (including the bumpers) and a new grille and headlights. The engine also received new emissions equipment, consisting of two catalytic converters, an air pump, and an air control valve, which robbed the 2.0 four of some power. Also new for 1981 was the &quot;Luxury&quot; model, which featured ample equipment. The entire range received softer suspension settings for increased comfort, but these were tightened up again during the 1982 model year.

Sedans of this generation were also assembled in New Zealand in three versions – four-speed manual base, three-speed automatic mid range and five-speed manual &quot;Limited.&quot; Facelift models were much the same but some had velour upholstery and tinted glass. In 1982, Mazda New Zealand offered a locally assembled limited edition model called the Anniversary to mark 10 years of local build. Based on the Limited, this model had larger US-style bumpers, additional driving lights in the grille, a standard AM radio (this was a year before FM stereo radio was introduced in NZ) plus alloy wheels and unique velour upholstery. This was also the first locally-built Mazda to have a laminated windscreen as standard.

In Australia, the CB series was launched in December 1978. It was available as a four-door sedan in three trim levels (Standard, Deluxe and Super Deluxe) and as a two-door Super Deluxe hardtop. The engine was the 2.0-litre inline-four engine available with three transmissions (four-speed and five-speed manual or three-speed automatic). The Deluxe model added cloth-inserted seats, push button radio, bumper rubber inserts, rubber body side protection mouldings, intermittent wipers, chrome wheel rings, map reading lights, and seat back map pockets. The Super Deluxe added halogen headlamps, window tint, FM radio, bumper overriders, and electronic safety check panel. For the facelift model from 1980 in Australia, the base &quot;Standard&quot; model was renamed &quot;Special&quot;, while the sedan and hardtop Super Deluxe trims each received unique (to trim level and body variant) wheel trims. A rear folding armrest, central locking and sunroof were added to the Super Deluxe sedan. Another minor update in 1981 changed the wheel designs for the Super Deluxe.

== Third generation (GC; 1982–1987) ==
In September 1982, the third-generation Capella was released using the new front-wheel-drive Mazda GC platform. As before, the international version was named the 626, with this version being named &quot;Import Car of the Year&quot; by &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine, the Car of the Year Japan award in 1982, and Car of the Year by &quot;Wheels&quot; magazine for 1983. It came in fifth in the 1984 European Car of the Year, the highest finish up to that date for a Japanese car. It immediately sold very well across Europe.

Sedan and coupé bodystyles were offered as before, with – due to demand – a five-door hatchback variant added. Inline-four engines displacing 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0 litres were offered, with the 2.0-litre also available with a turbo and . In September 1983 a 2.0-litre diesel was added to the lineup. In other regions including Finland, the 626 offered with a twin barrel carburetor. The Swiss market only received a 2-litre version, with the lower power a result of different emissions standards. In addition to the commonly seen model, there was also a short-nosed version with smaller headlamps and a larger grille, which necessitated a different bonnet as well. This model was sold in Southeast Asia and Oceania and possibly other markets including the GCC countries. A dealer optional model with the front end and pop-up headlights from the Mazda 929/Cosmo (HB) was also available to special customers in Indonesia.

The rear suspension was now independent, and though the wheelbase remained the same as the previous model, it was an entirely different car. A SOHC non-turbo diesel 2.0-litre &quot;RF&quot; engine was made available; twenty examples were imported officially into Australia from 1983 to 1987. The diesel also benefitted from ventilated brakes up front and a variable ratio steering rack, to minimize the effects of the (slight) additional weight. European markets also received a 1.6-litre &quot;F6&quot; engine. The placement of the power window controls was on the centre console, ahead of the gear shift/automatic transmission gear selector, as opposed to the traditional installation of the window switches on the respective doors.

Ford Asia Pacific (FASPAC) also sold the 626 as the Ford Telstar from 1983 (complete with slightly different styling and dashboard) in place of the European-sourced Sierra, although Ford New Zealand did offer the Sierra wagon (in both 1.6- and 2.0-litre versions) from May 1984 after the long best-selling Cortina estate car was discontinued, in lieu of the Mazda&#x27;s lack of an equivalent model.

Mazda New Zealand initially assembled 626 &quot;short nose&quot; 1.8-litre four-door sedan and a &quot;long nose&quot; 2.0-litre five-door model with a higher trim level including a digital instrument panel. A small number of two-door coupés were imported built-up from Japan. Laminated windscreens were now standard. A midlife facelift for the 1985 model year brought a completely new dashboard with orange digital LCD electronic displays in top models (in place of the earlier luminescent green) and the sedan now had the long nose and 2.0-litre engine. Ford&#x27;s Telstar received similar changes.

The new 2.0-litre &quot;FE&quot; engine was up to for the North American market, where the car received larger bumpers and sealed-beam headlights as per federal regulations. A 626 &quot;GT&quot; (also called the &quot;Turbo&quot; in Canada) was introduced in 1986 using the and &quot;FET&quot; engine. The rest of the line got a new front clip with dual (rather than quad) headlights and an entirely new interior, and fuel injection on the base engine meant . A new four-speed automatic, some trim changes, and five new colours were introduced for 1987, the last model year of this series.

The GC, locally assembled by Sigma, was released in South Africa in 1983. Due to a local content programme then in force, a facelifted version continued in production by Samcor until 1993. This featured the front end of the GD coupé, but with amber lens indicators and a blanked-off grille, as well as the rear lights from the Ford Telstar, which was not sold locally, Ford still offering the Sierra. The GD was not sold in South Africa, although it was assembled in neighbouring Zimbabwe by Willowvale Motor Industries in both sedan and wagon versions. The 626 L entered production in Colombia with CCA (Compañía Colombiana Automotriz) in May 1984, as a four-door sedan equipped with the 92 PS 1.8-litre engine. The LX (five-door) and GLX (coupé) versions followed in 1985, with the GLX coupé receiving the 102 PS 2.0-litre engine and more luxurious equipment including power steering and windows, as well as digital instrumentation. In the first quarter of 1986 the range was facelifted: the taillights were revised and the hatchback and coupé received new, larger bumpers. The L (sedan) was the only model left with the 1.8 engine as the LX (hatchback) was now a 2-litre, closer to the coupé in its specifications. The GC-series continued to be available until the beginning of 1988, when the next generation 626 replaced it.

== Fourth generation (GD/GV; 1987–1992) ==
The fourth-generation Capella was released in May 1987. It used the updated GD platform and some versions remained in production in Japan until 1996. Engines were new, though they still emphasized torque rather than outright power. Most of the world received 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, and 2.2 (non-turbo) engines. The GT model had a 2.0-litre FE-DOHC engine that produced 148 (without a catalytic converter) or 140 PS (with a catalytic converter). Some models were available with a new 2.0 diesel &quot;RF-CX&quot; engine, notable for its use of a pressure wave supercharger (Comprex), that previously could be found in the Mazda Bongo commercial. Diesel models were also exported to Europe, usually with the naturally aspirated engine. By 1990, the 1.6 had been discontinued in most markets, although JDM models intended for commercial use still used the little B6 engine.

The 626 was released in the US for the 1988 model year in 3 trims: DX, LX, and Turbo. Standard equipment included velour upholstery with front bucket seats, Mazda&#x27;s Twin Trapezoidal Link independent rear suspension, and a fuel injected 2.2-litre SOHC 4-cylinder motor. The LX trim offered power door locks, mirrors and windows, cruise control, oscillating vents, and an upgraded sound system with a subwoofer among other things. The Turbo was equipped in similar fashion to the LX, adding an intercooler turbocharger system, adjustable dampening, and 15-inch alloy wheels.

The 626/Capella was available globally as a sedan, station wagon (estate), five-door hatchback, and as a coupé – although the coupé was renamed MX-6 for the North American and Australian markets. In Japan, the five-door was sold as the &quot;Capella CG&quot; (for &quot;City Gear&quot;) and the coupé as the &quot;Capella C2&quot; (&quot;Composite Coupé&quot;). There was also a four-door hardtop sedan with unique bodywork, sold only in Japan, called the Mazda Persona.

The station wagon version, intended as a true load carrier, was introduced in the northern-hemisphere spring of 1988 on a slightly modified platform (called the GV). The station wagon also had a seven-seat option in some markets. Five-speed manuals and four-speed automatics were offered, with a few export markets also receiving a four-speed manual. Four-wheel drive was introduced in July 1987 for some versions, although it was never made available in the coupé nor in the North American market. Another new option was 4-wheel-steering, introduced in February 1988, with Mazda&#x27;s system being electronic and more complex than the 4WS system introduced by Honda on their 1988 Prelude. This system was only available in the five-door and the coupé. While not particularly successful in the marketplace, Japanese consumers could choose this option for longer than could export customers. All of the body styles also had optional ABS. The final facelift made a driver&#x27;s side airbag an option for the buyer.

The 626 line was facelifted for 1990, although mainstream Japanese production ended in 1991. Ford kept building a manual-only GD series sedan, called the Telstar Classic, aimed at fleet customers. The Capella station wagon was still available up until November 1997 (1996 in export markets). As part of a Japanese trend at the time, it was also developed into an &quot;RV&quot;, a sporting model with off-road pretensions. The Capella Van version, for commercial use only, actually continued in production until April 1999. It was equipped with the 1.6-litre B6 engine or the naturally aspirated diesel. When the new CG Capella was introduced in August 1994, the &quot;Capella Cargo&quot; received a facelift with a bigger grille and headlights and its name was changed to &quot;Capella Wagon&quot;. The last addition to the Japanese lineup was a two-wheel-drive version of the 2.0 GT engine which arrived in June 1996.

UK trim levels were LX (1.8-litre 8v), GLX (1.8-litre 8v /2.0-litre 12v), GLX Executive (2.0-litre 12v) and GT (2.0-litre 16v) GLX Executive 4x4 (2.2-litre 12v) Some early 2.0GT models had four-wheel steering. There was also an estate model with either the 2.0-litre engine in GLX or GT trim, or the GLX Executive 4x4 2.2. The 2.0GT was also available in two-door coupe form. Most European markets received similar lineups, albeit with diesel options in many countries.

The MX-6 was built in Michigan alongside its platform-mate, the Ford Probe at AutoAlliance International, while North American market 626s were still imported from Japan. 626 hatchbacks disappeared after 1991 from the US Mazda model range. The base model now used Mazda&#x27;s , 2.2-litre 3-valve SOHC &quot;F2&quot; producing just shy of the old turbocharged engine, and the new turbo was up to . The 1988 introduction of four-wheel steering to the 626 Turbo liftback, along with Honda&#x27;s Prelude 4WS, marked the first 4WS systems for the US market. It was later also made available to the MX-6. In 1990, the 626 gained motorized seat belts for the US market only. Consumer response was strong.

As for the previous generation, Colombian-built versions were the L (sedan), LX (liftback), and GLX (coupé). They entered local production in the first half of 1988. The L used the 1.8 with 90 PS while the LX and GLX received the 102 PS two-litre - both engines still carburetted, with automatic chokes. This generation is known as &quot;Asahi&quot; in Colombia. The gearing was shorter than for the GC versions, to better suit the mountainous nature of the country.

Mazda New Zealand again assembled a range of four-door sedan and five-door hatchback models, supplemented by the newly available wagon, and imported the four-door sedan in GT Spec with 2.0-litre FE-DOHC. The imported coupe and top five-door version, both with electronically controlled rear-wheel steering. Ford New Zealand&#x27;s Telstar line was similar, including the wagon and imported rear-wheel steering models (TBC, 4WS was never on the Telstar), but without the coupe. The wagon&#x27;s arrival enabled Ford to drop the UK-sourced Sierra wagon from local assembly, simplifying model sourcing. The NZ-specification cars, though imported CKD, shared much of their specifications with uncatalyzed European models including the modified tail lamp assemblies with the mandatory-for-Europe fog light lenses though the bulbs and wiring were not included. This and later generations would also be imported used from Japan in later years, greatly widening the choice of models and specifications available in this market.

After the introduction of the next generation 626 (a rebadged Mazda Cronos), the station wagon continued to be assembled (alongside its slightly lower priced sister, the Telstar GL). Only a 2.0-litre GLX was offered, with the uncatalyzed 12-valve engine.


== Fifth generation (1992–1997)==
=== International (GE; 1992–1997) ===
For the fifth generation, GE series sedan and hatchback, the Capella name was dropped—although export markets retained the 626 title. In this generation, there was no station wagon version in this line-up. Its nameplate replacements, the Mazda Cronos (sedan) and ɛ̃fini MS-6 (hatchback) that launched in November 1991 were pitched to Japanese customers instead. Both were slightly narrower than the export 626 saloons and hatchbacks to meet Japanese tax restrictions. Built on the GE platform, the hatchback-only MS-6 was launched under the ɛ̃fini brand, as a separate car from the sedan-only Cronos, as Mazda was at the beginning of an ambitious five-brand expansion plan of doubling sales. Including the badge-engineered Ford Telstar (sold at Japanese Ford dealerships called Autorama), the Mazda MX-6 coupe, and the Autozam Clef, a total of five cars were spawned off the same platform, launched under four different brands in Japan over a two-year period.

All of these models ended their production run prematurely, most likely due to the difficulties involved in promoting so many new nameplates as the Japanese economy began to feel the effects of the recession resulting from the Japanese asset price bubble from 1985 to 1991. While the MS-6 shared the Cronos GE platform, it was marketed as the more sporty of the two. The Capella badge lived on with the wagon/van versions on the previous GV series until 1999. Until 1989, Japanese car taxation used a car&#x27;s width as a key determinant. The Cronos and its siblings all exceed the critical level in width. The series GE platform shared the same width dimension as the luxury brand ɛ̃fini MS-8 and ɛ̃fini MS-6, sharing the 2.5-litre V6. Moving in accord with early-1990s zeitgeist, Mazda considered width a key factor in the Cronos&#x27; sales failure, and proceeded to create a narrower stopgap model from the CG platform. This car was introduced in 1994 as the new CG series Capella sedan.

;Export
Nonetheless, the GE Cronos and MS-6 continued to be sold as the Mazda 626 in nearly all export markets. European sales of the new 626 began in January 1992. The 626 was again &quot;Wheels&quot; magazine&#x27;s Car of the Year for a second time in 1992.

The European (E-spec) and Asian (JDM) models had many differences versus the North American (A-spec) models. These include: raised turn signal side markers vs the A-Spec flush mounted side markers, small fog lights with silver bezels vs the A-Spec full fitting fog lights, different interior cloth patterns, projector headlamps (glass lenses), a 1.8-litre FP engine, and a hatchback model. Europe also received a diesel-engined version, using the &quot;Comprex&quot; pressure-wave supercharged RF engine seen in the previous generation JDM Capella. Power in Europe is ECE at 4000 rpm, while the Japanese model claims JIS at the same engine speed. European models were also available in a model with four-wheel steering until a mid-1994 lineup adjustment. This was only offered in the hatchback with the 2.5-litre V6 and a manual transmission and not many were sold.

For the first time for a Mazda, the 626 began manufacturing in the US at Flat Rock, Michigan on 1 September 1992 for the 1993 model year. The car was originally known as the &quot;626 Cronos&quot; in Canada, but dropped the Cronos for the 1996 model year. Mazda&#x27;s 2.5-litre V6 engine debuted to rave reviews. Though the 626&#x27;s manual transmission was highly regarded, U.S.-built four-cylinder 626s from 1994 onwards used the widely used Ford CD4E automatic transmission (designated by Mazda as LA4A-EL), which replaced the 1993 model&#x27;s Japanese sourced transmission, which continued on in the V6 model. The CD4E was manufactured in Batavia, Ohio under ZF Batavia, a joint venture between Ford and ZF Friedrichshafen AG. In service in the Mazda 626, the transmission was reputed to have a higher failure rate than in other applications. It is widely known to transmission specialists that the CD4E overheats due to a poorly designed valve body and torque converter. Mazda issued relevant Technical Service Bulletins (0400502, 01598, 003/97K, 006/95) regarding the transmission and torque converter. The CD4E was produced until 2008 at Batavia and was never officially recalled in any application. In 1994, a passenger side airbag was added, whilst some models of the 1994 and 1995 Mazda 626 2.0L automatics were outfitted with Ford&#x27;s EEC-IV diagnostic system. In North America, the V6 spread to the &quot;LX&quot; trim in addition to the leather &quot;ES&quot; trim. New for 1996 and 1997 models were a redesigned hood (raised centre portion), chrome grille fairing (attached to the hood), and the introduction of the on Board Diagnostics II revision (OBD-II).

In Colombia the car was named 626 Matsuri (Japanese for &quot;holiday&quot;) to differentiate from the past version that was sold at the same time.

Mazda New Zealand assembled this generation for four years with few changes. Ford&#x27;s variants (since 1987 all built in the same Ford-Mazda joint venture Vehicle Assemblers of New Zealand (VANZ) factory in Wiri, South Auckland) had minor styling and equipment differences (the top Telstar hatchback had an electric sunroof) and anti-lock brakes were now standard on some models, for which factory engineers had to build a special test rig at the end of the assembly line. These were also the first 626/Telstar models to have factory fitted air conditioning, though only standard on the top Limited (626) and TX5 XRi (Telstar) five-door hatchbacks.


=== Japan (CG; 1994–1997) ===
Since 1991, the Capella label had only been used for the lingering GV series wagon and van as a result of Mazda&#x27;s attempt at brand diversification. This changed when the new, more compact CG series Capella launched in August 1994. It was built on the CG platform designed for the upscale Mazda Lantis and Eunos 500. This vehicle lasted only until 1997, and the Capella name returned to the G platform at this time. Available only with a four-door saloon bodywork, it received 1.8- or 2.0-litre inline-four engines.

The slightly reduced width dimension of this series was due to the fact that the Japanese Government taxes exterior dimensions and engine displacement that exceed regulations. This factor is a key component in all vehicles sold in Japan, and this generation vehicle was introduced so as to encourage sales of the Capella against rival Japanese products.

Another factor was that Japan was entering an economic recession due to the effects of the &quot;bubble economy&quot;, and all Japanese industries were experiencing a decline in manufactured products.

The sporting models of previous Capellas were now sold under other nameplates, and the CG received in 1.8 form and in the 2.0-litre. Four-wheel drive was available with the larger engine only. Equipment levels were Li-S, Li, and Gi for the 1.8. The 2.0 was sold as the Zi or as the Fi when equipped with four-wheel drive. In August 1997, the Capella was replaced by the new GF model, which was the same as the 626 outside of North America.


== Sixth generation (1997–2002) ==
=== International (GF, GW; 1997–2002) ===
1997 brought the sixth-generation Capella, now on the GF platform. The Mazda Cronos name was retired and the Capella, 626, and Telstar once again shared a common platform. All-wheel drive was optional in Japan. The hatchback, a popular variant in Australasia and Europe, was not sold in Japan. North American 626&#x27;s were again built by AutoAlliance International in Flat Rock, Michigan, and had an entirely different body and differing engine options from 626&#x27;s sold in the rest of the world. Beside sedan and hatchback styles, the station wagon style was returned in the generation. Once again, the station wagon version used a slightly modified, carryover platform (now called GW, released in 1998). The wheelbase was longer than the sedan, and a V6 engine was offered. This time though, the bodywork was the same, minimizing confusion for buyers.

By now, Ford had decided to reintroduce European models in Australasia so the Mondeo replaced the Telstar in most markets though the latter was still sold in Japan. The Capella was lightly updated in 1999 with a new interior and exterior, cabin air filtration, an available turbo-diesel engine, a new &quot;Activematic&quot; manually operated automatic transmission, and available EBD and DSC.

The Mazda 626 GLX is a European and Asian only trim level of the Mazda 626 not produced or sold in North America. It is Japanese-made, with a 2.0-litre four-cylinder DOHC-engine (FS) and a four-speed automatic transmission, which produces at 6,000 rpm and 133 lb·ft (180 N·m) at 4,000 rpm. The 2.0-litre turbo-diesel version was added to European market versions beginning in fall of 1998. The European trim levels are LXI, GXI, GSI, GXI SPORT, Atlantis, GXI SE, GSI SE. The European 626 was available with two different 2.0 engines, a 115 PS engine was available from 1998 to 2002 in all models except for the GSI SE and Sport models, which have the 136 PS FS engine.

In 2000, Mazda built the 626 MPS (Mazda Performance Series) concept sedan model. It debuted at the 2000 Geneva Motor Show as a concept car and only a few were ever produced. It would have included a new 2.5L 280 horsepower twin turbo redesign of the KL-ZE engine mated with a 5-speed manual transmission. However, the 626 MPS was never realized as the next generation of the 626, with the Mazda 6 MPS being introduced instead.

=== North America (1997–2002) ===
The North American market 626, introduced in 1997 for the 1998 model year was different from those sold in other countries. The Michigan-built 626 resembled its predecessor, lacking the aggression which could be seen in the 626/Capella as built for the rest of the world. It was also considerably larger and heavier. LX and ES models were available, with both 2.0L and 2.5L V6 engines. Unusual amongst its competitors, the V6 was available with a manual transmission.

From 1998 through 1999 the 626 was given an engine overhaul to give it better pedal feel. However, as most car reviews attested, it is a bland vehicle with softer handling and fewer features than the 1993–1997 version. One such quote from Edmunds described it as &quot;a bland, bread-and-butter sedan that&#x27;s not big enough for families and not sporty enough for enthusiasts.&quot; Along with a nearly invisible facelift, front side airbags were new options for 2000, as were larger wheels, four-wheel discs, and rear heat ducts. The four-cylinder engine was also upgraded by .

The final Mazda 626 rolled off the Flat Rock, Michigan assembly plant on 30 August 2002 but in Colombia they were still being produced until 2005.

<text>Mark Divo (born 1966) is a Swiss-Luxembourgian conceptual artist and curator. He organizes large-scale interactive art projects incorporating the work of underground artists. His work involves painting, performance, photography, sculpture and installation.

== Early life ==
Divo was born in 1966. From 1987 to 1989 he studied social sciences in Göttingen. He had his first self-organized exhibition in 1988. In 1989 he dropped out of his studies and moved to Berlin.

==Career==
Between 1988 and 1989 Divo worked in West Berlin. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, he moved to East Berlin, where he organized exhibitions at the Kunst Haus Tacheles. Between 1990 and 1994 he organized exhibitions, performances, and murals with the Duncker group.

In 1994 he moved back to Zürich where he created a number of murals and organised a group of travelling mural painters. There he organised several underground art projects funded by the Swiss government, including exhibitions/events in the subways of Escherwyssplatz. In 1995, he organised a festival of underground art. Amongst the artists who exhibited were Swiss artist Ingo Giezendanner, German artist Leumund Cult and British artist Lennie Lee.

In the winter of 2002, he occupied the Cabaret Voltaire with different artists including Dan Jones. Together they succeeded in preventing the location&#x27;s closure. The building has now been turned into a museum dedicated to Dada (Cabaret Voltaire). In 2003 he organised a Dada festival at the Sihlpapierfabrik.

In 2004, Divo was awarded a one year art residency at the Swiss Institute Contemporary Art New York in West Broadway, New York, where he invited artists to exhibit alongside him. In the summer of 2008, he established the Divo Institute, a multi-disciplinary arts center in the city of Kolín, near Prague. In August 2009, Divo was one of thirty artist-curators who presented work by artists from the Divo Institute at the Subvision Art Festival in Hamburg. 

Since becoming an artist, Divo has exhibited in museums throughout Europe including the Helmhaus, Zürich, the Contemporary Art Center, Vilnius, the Kunsthaus Zürich and the Kinský Palace, Prague. He has created three public sculptures for the city of Zürich.

Since 2002, working in collaboration with artists, performers and photographers, Divo has produced a series of large-format satirical photographs.

<text>WKVR (102.5 FM) is a radio station licensed to Baltimore, Ohio. Owned by the Southeastern Ohio Broadcasting System of Zanesville, which often does business as the WHIZ Media Group, and operated by Educational Media Foundation via a long-term local marketing agreement, the station serves much of the Columbus metropolitan area. The WKVR transmitter resides off Pickerington Road in Carroll. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WKVR is available online.

==History==
===WHIZ-FM/WCVZ (1961–2010)===

The 102.5 MHz frequency was originally licensed to Zanesville, Ohio, and signed on as the original home to WHIZ-FM on December 16, 1961. Under the ownership of the Southeastern Ohio Broadcasting System, Inc.&#x27;s WHIZ Media Group, WHIZ-FM programmed an adult contemporary format long identified as &quot;Z102&quot;.

The WHIZ Media Group was granted authority to change WHIZ-FM&#x27;s city of license from Zanesville to Baltimore, Ohio, in the fall of 2005, and a construction permit to build a new transmitter site was granted in October 2008. On October 17, 2008, the WHIZ Media Group purchased WCVZ (92.7 FM) in South Zanesville (from which those call letters stood for the Christian Voice of Zanesville) as the new frequency for WHIZ-FM. Both WCVZ and WHIZ-FM simulcast programming as &quot;Z102 and 92.7&quot; until December 7, 2008, when WCVZ assumed WHIZ-FM&#x27;s identity as &quot;Z92.7&quot;, and WHIZ-FM became &quot;Highway 102&quot;, featuring an automated country music format.

The &quot;Highway 102&quot; format continued on the 102.5 MHz frequency even after the station completed their relocation to Baltimore on October 1, 2008, and assumed the WCVZ call letters, while the 92.7 MHz frequency became WHIZ-FM. What was now WCVZ effectively ended any connection to the Zanesville region and consequently entered the Columbus market. As a result of this move-in as &quot;Highway 102&quot;, the station became one of four country music radio outlets in Columbus – WHOK-FM, WCOL-FM and WNKK being the other stations.

===2010 &quot;frequency shift&quot;===

On June 30, 2010, Ohio State University&#x27;s WOSU Public Media announced a $4.8 million purchase of WWCD (101.1 FM) from Fun With Radio, LLC.; at the same time, Fun With Radio entered into a local marketing agreement with the WHIZ Media Group to take over programming on the 102.5 MHz frequency immediately, with a future option for purchase. Although generally reported and regarded as a &quot;frequency shift&quot;, Fun With Radio took over programming and operations of WCVZ; changed the station&#x27;s format from country music to alternative rock as a direct simulcast of WWCD (101.1 FM); and rebranded the station as CD101 @ 102.5.

WOSU Public Media&#x27;s purchase of WWCD (101.1 FM) was consummated that December 14, with WOSU Public Media changing WWCD&#x27;s callsign to WOSA; and changing the station&#x27;s format to classical music. WCVZ&#x27;s callsign was concurrently changed to WWCD; Fun With Radio retained all of WWCD (101.1 FM)&#x27;s respective on- and off-air staff. In effect, this new WWCD licensed to Baltimore became the successor to the previous WWCD (101.1 FM) licensed to Grove City.

For some time, WWCD continued to use the anachronistic &quot;CD101&quot; brand over the air, online and in print, even though the terms of the sale with Ohio State University clearly dictated that WWCD must cease any and all on-air mentions of &quot;101&quot; or &quot;101.1&quot; when the deal closed. Several days before the initial sale with WOSU Public Media was announced, Fun With Radio, LLC registered the domain names CD101at1025.com and CD1025.com, which originally acted as redirectors to CD101.com; following the station rebranding to CD102.5 in 2012, the website was moved to the CD1025.com domain.

===WWCD (2010–2020)===

In November 2011, amid weeks of speculation that Salem Communications was negotiating to either purchase or lease the 102.5 FM frequency as a new location for the programming of WRFD, WWCD general manager Randy Malloy formed a new company, WWCD Ltd., to purchase the intellectual property of CD101 from Roger Vaughn&#x27;s Fun With Radio, LLC. Vaughn retained a minority share of the new company, though all references to Fun With Radio would be removed from any station documents and promotion. The new ownership group immediately began negotiating a new lease agreement with Southeastern Ohio Broadcasting, owner of the frequency. On September 15, 2017, Randy Malloy became sole owner of WWCD, Ltd.

Former WWCD DJs include the aforementioned Davis, who helmed the afternoon shift from 1991 until his death; Mase Brazelle, the station&#x27;s Program Director from 2016 until his death; Jim Ballantine, a Columbus Chill player most notable for wearing the first three-digit jersey number in professional sports history (101, in a nod to the station&#x27;s frequency); and Fritz the Nite Owl, who also once hosted one of the last late night movie television programs locally produced in the United States. Fritz&#x27;s show was broadcast on WCLL-CA, television channel 19, in Columbus.

The station featured &quot;Guest DJs&quot; once a week, where anyone has the chance of being a DJ for an hour on air. A compilation of 12-15 songs is put together by the guest, and they can play them during this hour. With COVID-19 concerns in mind, the station pivoted to &quot;Select-a-Set&quot; in March 2020, a newly revived program where listeners can remotely share their playlists without in-studio presence.

===WWLG (2020–2024)===
On October 31, 2020, &quot;CD102.5&quot; announced that the LMA with the WHIZ Media Group would expire at the end of the day, with programming to be moved online. WWCD Limited would subsequently lease WMYC (1580 AM and 92.9 FM) effective November 21, and WDLR (1550 AM) effective January 1, 2021, to return its &quot;CD&quot; alternative rock programming to the air.

At 12:01 a.m. on November 1, 102.5 FM would temporarily go dark; it signed back on about 15 minutes later with a jockless mix of rock music and legal station identification. On November 6, 2020, at 10 a.m., Urban One took over operations of WWCD via local marketing agreement and changed the format to Regional Mexican, branded as &quot;La Grande 102.5&quot;. The station adopted the WWLG call letters on November 12.

The WWLG license was not included in the 2022 sale of the remainder of the WHIZ Media Group to Marquee Broadcasting.

===WKVR (2024–present)===
Urban One&#x27;s LMA of WWLG would end at the end of October 2024, coinciding with a partnership with La Mega Media under which WWLA (103.1 FM) would simulcast on Urban One-owned WJYD (107.1 FM). On November 1, 102.5 would begin being leased out by Educational Media Foundation to broadcast their Christian adult contemporary brand, K-Love, under new call sign WKVR. The following week, it was reported that EMF would buy the station outright for $2,060,000.

<doc id="731625" wikidata="Q249590" url="?curid=731625" title="Milt Campbell">
<text>Milton Gray Campbell (December 9, 1933 – November 2, 2012) was an American decathlete of the 1950s. In 1956, he became the first African American to win the gold medal in the decathlon of the Summer Olympic Games.

==Personal life==
Campbell was born in Plainfield, New Jersey. At Plainfield High School he competed in track, football and swimming. He then enrolled at the Indiana University (Bloomington), where he played football and ran track.

Milton Gray Campbell, more commonly known as “Milt”, was born on December 9, 1933, in Plainfield, New Jersey. While Campbell&#x27;s love for sports was apparent from a very young age - always competing with and trying to outperform his older brother, Tom - his athletic prowess was first noticed in high school. He attended Plainfield High School (class of &#x27;53) where he participated in track and field, played football, and swam at a time where it was a widely accepted idea in the sports world that African-Americans were unable to properly swim.

==Track and field==
While a student at Plainfield High School, Campbell won a place on the 1952 Olympic team in the decathlon. Although just 18 years old, Campbell finished second to Bob Mathias in the decathlon. Campbell set New Jersey state records in the high and low hurdles and in the high jump, and scored 140 points as fullback in football. He was inducted into the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association Hall of Fame in 1997. He was &quot;Track and Field News&quot; &quot;High School Athlete of the Year&quot; in 1952.

While he earned the distinction of “All-State” in both football and swimming, Campbell excelled most in track and field, and told his coach that he aspired to be the greatest athlete in the entire state of New Jersey, to which his coach responded that he believed Campbell could possibly become the best in the world. Campbell, surprised at his response, inquired how such a feat would be possible for him to achieve. His coach instructed him that in order to do so, he would have to win the Olympic decathlon. Campbell, having never heard of the decathlon, had to look it up to gain more information. Intrigued by its nature, Campbell decided to take on the challenge and began training. He wanted to represent the United States in the upcoming 1952 Olympic Games which were to be held in Helsinki. Campbell initially wanted to qualify for the hurdles event, but when the day came he placed fourth, with only the top three qualifying. Through the guidance of his Plainfield High coach, an 18-year-old Campbell made the Olympic decathlon team - his qualifier being his first-ever participation in a decathlon event - and ended up placing second behind Bob Mathias, the gold medalist from the previous 1948 London Games. When he returned home to New Jersey, he was greeted with applause and congratulations for earning a silver medal in the event. However, Campbell himself was disappointed, having wanted to win, and knew that he needed to practice harder and longer over the next four years in order to excel at and win the 1956 Olympics, which were to be held in Melbourne.

In the time between the 1952 and 1956 Olympics, Campbell enrolled at the Indiana University (Bloomington), and, much like in high school, he played football and ran track - further preparing for the upcoming Games. By the time the summer of 1956 rolled around, Campbell was prepared: He went out onto the Melbourne track and dominated, earning a gold medal in the decathlon, and also setting a record of 13.4 seconds for the 120 yd hurdles.

==Football==
Campbell was also an excellent swimmer as a youth. An all around athlete, Campbell was drafted by the NFL Cleveland Browns in 1957 and played one season in the same backfield as Jim Brown. Milt was released from the Cleveland Browns by owner Paul Brown for marrying a white woman. He then played for several years in the Canadian Football League, ending his football career in 1964.

While his spectacular performance as an Olympic decathlete was likely the peak of his athletic career, he continued to display his prowess on the football field, being drafted by the NFL Cleveland Browns in 1957. He rushed seven times for 23 total yards in the halfback position and played alongside MVP and Rookie of the Year running back Jim Brown. However, his NFL career was unjustly short-lived: The owner of the Browns, Paul Brown, placed his segregationist ideals above Campbell&#x27;s athletic ability, and kicked him off the team for his marriage to Barbara Mount, a white woman. According to Campbell, Brown called him into his office the day before Campbell was “let go” and asked him why he got married, Campbell responded “I got married for the same reason you got married, I presume,” and told Brown that it was none of his business. He received a letter the next day telling him that his services were no longer needed by the Browns. Still wanting to pursue a career in football, Campbell went to Canada, where he joined the Canadian Football League, playing with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats (8 games rushing for 468 yards), Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen, Montreal Alouettes (3 games) and Toronto Argonauts (9 games) until his retirement in 1964.

==Judo==
As he finished with most sports, Milt sought to stay active. He started Judo and quickly progressed through the ranks under Yoshishada Yoneska. Yoshishada stated that Milt had a strong chance to make the 1972 Olympic team. An AAU Official took his card and stated he could not compete in the Olympics for Judo. The reason was that Milt had competed as a professional football player. Milt was troubled as professional track runners were allowed to compete in the Olympics, but he could not because he played football.

In 2008, a degree of Doctor of Public Service, &quot;honoris causa&quot;, was conferred upon him by Monmouth University in West Long Branch, New Jersey.

==Legacy==
Despite his accomplishments as an extraordinary athlete, Milt Campbell never became a household name, nor was he properly rewarded like other famous athletes of his time. Other Olympic decathletes such as Bob Mathias and Bruce Jenner gained many significant endorsements and a spot on a Wheaties box after their victories, while Campbell walked off of the 1956 podium with no cash, sponsors, or television executives asking for a feature. When asked about these differences in treatment, Campbell declared that “America wasn&#x27;t ready for a black man to be the best athlete in the world”. He has since been regarded as the Olympic superstar who is “famous” for not being famous. Renowned sports news platforms periodically procure lists of athletes that fit certain criteria as a means of praise for their incredible athletic prowess and achievements in the sporting world. As recently as 2000, ESPN has put out lists featuring the “50 Greatest Black Athletes” and the “Top 100 Athletes of the 20th Century”, which remind the public of what makes some of their heroes so notable. Campbell deserves to be high up on both of those lists, but in fact was not included or even mentioned on either list.

Campbell was inducted into the Indiana University Athletics Hall of Fame in 1982, and United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 1992. In June 2012, Campbell was voted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame. (nytimes.com). He is also present in the National Track and Field Hall of Fame and the International Swimming Hall of Fame, and remains the only individual to hold a spot in both of these Halls.

Following a long-fought battle with prostate cancer, Campbell died in his Gainesville, GA home in the summer of 2012 with his long-standing girlfriend Linda Rusch, by his side. He was 78 years old, and his survived by his daughters (Julee Campbell, Dorianne B., and Mona H.), his sons (Milton G. Campbell Jr., deceased, Justin Campbell, and Milton G. Campbell, III), his granddaughter (Taria L. Campbell), and his great-grandchild (Nathaniel G. Johnsen). He is interred at Memorial Park Cemetery and Mausoleum - North in Gainesville.

<text>Sexual violence is any harmful or unwanted sexual act—or attempt to obtain a sexual act through violence or coercion—or an act directed against a person&#x27;s sexuality without their consent, by any individual regardless of their relationship to the victim. This includes forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed, and may be physical, psychological, or verbal. It occurs in times of peace and armed conflict situations, is widespread, and is considered to be one of the most traumatic, pervasive, and most common human rights violations.

Sexual violence is a serious public health problem and has profound short- and long-term physical and mental health impacts such as increased risks of sexual and reproductive health problems, suicide, and HIV infection. Murder occurring either during a sexual assault or as a result of an honor killing in response to a sexual assault is also a factor of sexual violence. Though women and girls suffer disproportionately from these aspects, sexual violence can occur to anybody at any age; it is an act of violence that can be perpetrated by parents, caregivers, acquaintances and strangers, as well as intimate partners. It is rarely a crime of passion, and is rather an aggressive act that frequently aims to express power and dominance over the victim.

Sexual violence remains highly stigmatized in all settings, oftentimes dismissed as a women&#x27;s issue, thus levels of disclosure of the assault vary between regions. In general, it is a widely underreported phenomenon, thus available data tend to underestimate the true scale of the problem. In addition, sexual violence is also a neglected area of research, thus deeper understanding of the issue is imperative in order to promote a coordinated movement against it. Domestic sexual violence is distinguished from conflict-related sexual violence. Often, people who coerce their spouses into sexual acts believe their actions are legitimate because they are married. In times of conflict, sexual violence tends to be an inevitable repercussion of warfare trapped in an ongoing cycle of impunity. Rape of women and of men is often used as a method of warfare (war rape), as a form of attack on the enemy, typifying the conquest and degradation of its women or men or captured male or female fighters. Even if strongly prohibited by international human rights law, customary law and international humanitarian law, enforcement mechanisms are still fragile or even non-existent in many corners of the world.

From a historical perspective, sexual violence was considered as only being perpetrated by men against women and as being commonplace and &quot;normal&quot; during both war and peace times from the Ancient Greeks to the 20th century. This led to the negligence of any indications of what the methods, aims and magnitude of such violence was. It took until the end of the 20th century for sexual violence to no longer be considered a minor issue and to gradually become criminalized. Sexual violence is still used in modern warfare as recently as in the Rwandan genocide and in the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, targeting both Israelis and Palestinians.

==Definitions==

===General===
The World Health Organization (WHO) in its 2002 World Report on Violence and Health defined sexual violence as: &quot;any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed, against a person&#x27;s sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting, including but not limited to home and work&quot;. WHO&#x27;s definition of sexual violence includes but is not limited to rape, which is defined as physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration of the vulva or anus, using a penis, other body parts or an object. Sexual violence consists in a purposeful action of which the intention is often to inflict severe humiliation on the victims and diminish human dignity. In the case where others are forced to watch acts of sexual violence, such acts aim at intimidating the larger community.

Other acts incorporated in sexual violence are various forms of sexual assaults, such as forced contact between mouth and penis, vulva or anus. Sexual violence can include coerced contact between the mouth and penis, vulva or anus, or acts that do not involve physical contact between the victim and the perpetrator—for example, sexual harassment, threats, and peeping.

Coercion, with regard to sexual violence, can cover a whole spectrum of degrees of force. Apart from physical force, it may involve psychological intimidation, blackmail or other threats – for instance, the threat of physical harm, of being dismissed from a job or of not obtaining a job that is sought. It may also occur when the person being attacked is unable to give consent – for instance, while drunk, drugged, asleep or mentally incapable of understanding the situation.

Such broader definitions of sexual violence are found within international law. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has established in article 7(1)(g) that &quot;rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity&quot; constitutes a crime against humanity. Sexual violence is further explained in the ICC&#x27;s Elements of Crimes, which the Court uses in its interpretation and application of Article 7. The Elements of Crime establishes that sexual violence is:The United Nations Special Rapporteur on systemic rape sexual slavery and slavery-like practices during armed conflict, in a report in 1998, stipulated that sexual violence is &quot;any violence, physical or psychological, carried out through sexual means by targeting sexuality&quot;. This definition encompasses physical as well as psychological attacks aimed at &quot;a person&#x27;s sexual characteristics, such as forcing a person to strip naked in public, mutilating a person&#x27;s genitals, or slicing off a woman&#x27;s breasts&quot;. The Special Rapporteur&#x27;s definition also refers to situations &quot;in which two victims are forced to perform sexual acts on one another or to harm one another in a sexual manner&quot;.

The WHO lists a number of examples of circumstances that sexual violence can be committed:
* Systematic rape during armed conflict
* Rape within marriage or dating relationships
* Rape by strangers
* Unwanted sexual advances or sexual harassment, including demanding sex in return for favors
* Sexual abuse of mentally or physically disabled people
* Sexual abuse of children
* Forced marriage or cohabitation, including the marriage of children
* Denial of the right to use contraception or to adopt other measures to protect against sexually transmitted infections
* Forced abortion
* Violent acts against the sexual integrity of women, including female genital mutilation and obligatory inspection for virginity
* Forced prostitution and trafficking of people for the purpose of sexual exploitation

A thorough definition is necessary in monitoring the prevalence of sexual violence and studying trends over time. In addition, a consistent definition helps in determining the magnitude of sexual violence and aids in comparing the problem across demographics. Consistency allows researchers to measure risk and protective factors for victimization in a uniform manner. This ultimately informs prevention and intervention efforts.

===Conflict-related and domestic sexual violence===

A distinction is made between conflict-related sexual violence and domestic sexual violence:
* &quot;Conflict-related sexual violence&quot; is sexual violence perpetrated by combatants, including rebels, militias, and government forces. The various forms of sexual violence can be used systematically in conflicts &quot;to torture, injure, extract information, degrade, threaten, intimidate or punish&quot;. Sexual violence can in such cases amount to being a weapon of war.
* &quot;Domestic sexual violence&quot; is sexual violence perpetrated by intimate partners and by other family/household members, and is often termed &quot;intimate partner violence.&quot; This kind of sexual violence is widespread both during conflict and in peacetime. It is commonly believed that incidents of domestic sexual violence increase in wartime and in post-conflict environments.

==Victims==

===Spectrum===
All people can fall victim to sexual violence. This includes women, men, children, and people who define themselves in other terms, e.g., transgender or non-binary individuals. 

Most research, reports and studies focus on sexual violence perpetrated against women and in armed conflicts. The majority of victims are women, but men and children are also victims of sexual violence. The crime may be committed in peacetime or during conflict.

It is possible for individuals to be targeted based on sexual orientation or gender-exhibiting behaviour. Such attacks, which are often called &quot;corrective rapes&quot; have been performed to conform an individual to a heterosexual orientation or to more accepted notions of behaviour for the perceived gender of the victim; asexual individuals are also particularly targeted.

===Domestic sexual violence===
Domestic sexual violence includes all forms of unwanted sexual activity. It is considered abuse even if the victim may have previously engaged in consensual sexual activities with the perpetrator. Men and women can both fall victim to this type of abuse although women are more often the victims than men, and men perpetrate more often than women. Moreover, lesbian, bisexual, and trans women are more likely than cis and heterosexual women to experience intimate partner violence, which includes sexual violence. Male persons are more likely to commit domestic sexual violence regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation.

A 2006 WHO study on physical and sexual domestic violence against women conducted across ten countries found that the prevalence of domestic sexual violence ranged, on average, between 10% and 40%. Domestic sexual violence is also considerably less common than other forms of domestic violence. The variations in the findings across and within countries suggest that this type of abuse is not inevitable and can be prevented.

===Women===
Sexual violence against women and girls can take many forms and is carried out in different situations and contexts. Women comprise the great majority of victims of sexual violence and live with the possibility of falling victim in common life situations. For instance, a 1987 study concluded that college women reported being the victims of unwanted sex that was the result of men using verbal coercion and physical force to manipulate them into it, and alcohol or drugs to intoxicate them into it. 

Sexual violence is one of the most common and widespread violations that men subject women to during wartime. It also figures among the most traumatic experiences, both emotionally and psychologically, women suffer during conflict. Sexual violence, in particular rape, is often considered as a method of warfare: it is used not only to &quot;torture, injure, extract information, degrade, displace, intimidate, punish or simply destroy,&quot; but also as a strategy to destabilize communities and demoralize other men. The use of sexual violence as a weapon of war was widespread conflicts such as Rwanda, Sudan, Sierra Leone, and Kosovo. The perpetrators of female-directed violence in times of conflict are often armed groups and local men.

===Men===
As with sexual violence against women, sexual violence against men can take different forms, and occur in any kind of context, including at home or in the workplace, in prisons and police custody, and during war and in the military. The practice of sexually assaulting males is not confined to any geographical area of the world or its place of commission, and occurs irrespective of the victim&#x27;s age. The various forms of sexual violence directed against males include rape, enforced sterilization, enforced masturbation, and genital violence (including genital mutilation). In addition to the physical pain caused, sexual violence against men can also exploit local ideas of gender and sexuality to cause tremendous mental and psychological anguish for survivors that can last for years following the attack.

Male-directed sexual violence is more significant than is often thought. The scope of such crimes continues, however, to be unknown largely because of poor or a lack of documentation. The under- or non-reporting of sexual violence against males may often be due to fear, confusion, guilt, shame and stigma, or a combination thereof. Moreover, men may be reluctant to talk about being victim of crimes of sexual violence. In this regard, the way in which societies construct the notion of masculinity plays a role. Masculinity and victimization may be considered incompatible, in particular in societies where masculinity is equated with the ability to exert power, leading to non-reporting. The incompatibility between the conventional understanding of masculinity and victimization can arise both with regard to the attack itself and when coping with the consequences of such crimes. Because of under- and non-reporting on sexual violence against men, the little evidence that exists tends to be anecdotal.

In the case that sexual violence against males is recognized and reported, it is often categorized as &quot;abuse&quot; or &quot;torture&quot;. This is considered a tendency to hide sexual assaults directed at men as something else, and it is believed to contribute to the poor- or lack of reporting of such crimes, and can arise from the belief that sexual violence is a women&#x27;s issue and that men cannot be victims of sexual assaults.

===Children===

Sexual violence against children is a form of child abuse. It includes harassment and rape, as well as the use of children in prostitution or pornography.

Sexual violence is a serious infringement upon a child&#x27;s rights, and one which can result in significant physical and psychological trauma to the victim. A 2002 WHO study approximated that 223 million children have been victims of sexual violence involving physical contact. Yet, due to the sensitivity of the issue and the tendency of the crime to stay hidden, the true figure is likely to be much higher.

Girls are more frequent targets for sexual abuse than boys. The WHO study found that 150 million girls were abused compared to 73 million boys. Other sources also conclude that girls face a greater risk of sexual violence, including prostitution.

==Causes and factors==

===Explanations===

Explaining sexual violence is complicated by the multiple forms it takes and contexts in which it occurs. There is considerable overlap between forms of sexual violence and intimate partner violence. There are factors increasing the risk of someone being coerced into sex, factors increasing the risk of an individual person forcing sex on another person, and factors within the social environment including peers and family influencing the likelihood of rape and the reaction to it.

Research suggests that the various factors have an additive effect, so that the more factors present, the greater the likelihood of sexual violence. In addition, a particular factor may vary in importance according to the life stage.

Some 70% of people who experienced sexual violence were paralyzed before and during the assault. The prevailing view amongst scientists is that this form of tonic immobility occurs in humans when no other options to avoid the sexual violence are available anymore, and the brain paralyses the body in order to allow it to survive with minimal damage.

===Risk factors===

The following are individual risks factors:
* Alcohol and drug use
* Delinquency
* Empathic deficits
* General aggressiveness and acceptance of violence
* Early sexual initiation
* Coercive sexual fantasies
* Preference for impersonal sex and sexual-risk taking
* Exposure to sexually explicit media
* Hostility towards women
* Adherence to traditional gender role norms
* Hyper-masculinity
* Suicidal behavior
* Prior sexual victimization or perpetration

The following are relationship risk factors:
* Family environment characterized by physical violence and conflict
* Childhood history of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse
* Emotionally unsupportive family environment
* Poor parent-child relationships, particularly with fathers
* Association with sexually aggressive, hypermasculine, and delinquent peers
* Involvement in a violent or abusive intimate relationship

The following are community factors:
* Poverty
* Lack of employment opportunities
* Lack of institutional support from police and judicial system
* General tolerance of sexual violence within the community
* Weak community sanctions against sexual violence perpetrators

There is also post-catastrophe sexual opportunism. Sexual opportunism during and after catastrophic events is largely unreported. Massive spikes in human trafficking of girls and other humanitarian abuses has been reported in events such as after the devastating April 2015 Nepal earthquake.

===Perpetrators===
Perpetrators may come from various backgrounds, and they may be someone known by the victim like a friend, a family member, an intimate partner, an acquaintance, or they may be a complete stranger. While it is estimated that 93% to 97% perpetrators of sexual violence are men, sexual violence is often erroneously dismissed as a women&#x27;s issue. The primary motivators behind sexually violent acts are believed to be power and control, and not, as it is widely perceived, sexual desire. Sexual violence is rather a violent, aggressive and hostile act aiming to degrade, dominate, humiliate, terrorize and control the victim. Some of the reasons for committing sexual violence are that it reassures the offender about his sexual adequacy, it discharges frustration, compensates for feelings of helplessness, and achieves sexual gratification.

Data on sexually violent men are somewhat limited and heavily biased towards apprehended rapists, except in the United States, where research has also been conducted on male college students. Despite the limited amount of information on sexually violent men, it appears that sexual violence is found in almost all countries (though with differences in prevalence), in all socioeconomic classes and in all age groups from childhood on. Data on sexually violent men also show that most direct their acts at women whom they already know. Among the factors increasing the risk of a man committing rape are those related to attitudes and beliefs, as well as behavior arising from situations and social conditions that provide opportunities and support for abuse.

==Consequences==
Sexual violence is a serious public health problem and it has both short and long term negative physical and psychological effects on health and well-being. There is evidence that male and female victims of sexual violence may experience similar mental health, behavioral and social consequences. Watts, Hossain, and Zimmerman (2013) reported that 72.4% of the survivors had at least one gynecological complaint. 52.2% had chronic lower abdominal pain, 27.4% had abnormal vaginal bleeding, 26.6% had infertility, 25.3% had genital sores, and 22.5% had swellings in the abdomen. 18.7% of the participants also had severe psychological and surgical morbidity including alcoholism. 69.4% showed significant psychological distress, 15.8% attempted suicide, 75.6% had at least one surgical complaint. 4.8% of the participants had a positive HIV status.

In child sexual abuse (CSA) cases, the child may develop mental health disorders that can extend into adult life especially if sexual abuse involved actual intercourse. Studies on abused boys have shown that around one in five continue in later life to molest children themselves. CSA may lead to negative behavioral patterns in later life, learning difficulties as well as regression of or slower development.

The table below gives some examples of possible physical and psychological consequences of sexual violence:
In some cases victims of sexual violence may be stigmatized and ostracized by their families and others. Societal perceptions that the victim provoked sexual violence lead to a lack of disclosure of sexual assault which is associated with even more severe psychological consequences, particularly in children. Thus, more interventions are needed in order to order to change societal attitudes towards sexual violence as well as efforts designed to educate those to whom the survivors may disclose the assault.

==Treatment==
In the emergency room, emergency contraceptive medications are offered to women raped by men because about 5% of such rapes result in pregnancy. Preventative medication against sexually transmitted infections are given to victims of all types of sexual assault (especially for the most common diseases like chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis) and a blood serum is collected to test for STIs (such as HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis). Any survivor with abrasions are immunized for tetanus if five years have elapsed since the last immunization. Short-term treatment with a benzodiazepine may help with acute anxiety and antidepressants may be helpful for symptoms of PTSD, depression and panic attacks.

Sexual violence survivors who have lasting psychological symptoms as a result of their trauma may seek psychological counseling and therapy.
Informal treatment, or support, includes social support, which can provide avenues for social justice engagement. Themes of self-reflection, social support, and activism aimed at supporting other survivors and preventing sexual violence are associated with improved functioning and facilitating positive change post trauma. Involvement in anti-sexual violence activism can aid survivors in making sense of the social conditions that contributed to their violation, recover self-confidence, and facilitate peer support, however survivors have also identified burn out to be prevalent in activist work.

==Prevention==

The number of initiatives addressing sexual violence is limited and few have been evaluated. The approaches vary with most interventions being developed and implemented in industrialized countries. How relevant they may be in other settings is not well known. Early interventions and the provision of psychological support may prevent or minimize many of the harmful and lasting psychological impacts of sexual assault.The interventions that have been developed can be categorized as follows.

There is also a public health approach to prevention. Because sexual violence is widespread and directly or indirectly affects a community as whole, a community-oriented approach encourages not just victims and advocates to spread awareness and prevent sexual violence, but allocates responsibility to wider community to do so as well. The CDC&#x27;s report on Sexual Violence Prevention: Beginning the Dialogue suggests following its four step model.

# Define the Problem: Collect data about the victims, perpetrators, where it&#x27;s occurring, and how often it&#x27;s happening.
# Identify Risk and Protective Factors: Research the risk factors that may put people at risk for victimization of perpetration
# Develop and Test Prevention Strategies: Work with community leaders, practitioners to test different sexual violence prevention strategies
# Ensure Widespread Adoption: Implement and spread awareness about the successful prevention strategies

Child sexual abuse prevention programmes were developed in the United States of America during the 1970s and originally delivered to children. Programmes delivered to parents were developed in the 1980s and took the form of one-off meetings, two to three hours long. In the last 15 years, web-based programmes have been developed.

==Statistics==
Sexual violence is a widely underreported phenomenon, therefore available statistics are unlikely to inform about the true scale of the problem. The available data are scanty and fragmented. Police data, for instance, are often incomplete and limited. Data from medico-legal clinics, on the other hand, may be biased towards the more violent incidents of sexual abuse. In addition, the proportion of people who seek medical services for immediate problems related to sexual violence is also relatively small.

Reasons for non-reporting include shame and embarrassment, fear of not being believed, fear of the perpetrator of the crime, fear of the legal process, or disbelief that the police would be able to do anything to help them. Men are even more reluctant to report sexual violence due to extreme embarrassment and concerns about opinions of other people, their masculinity and the fact that they were unable to prevent the assault. Thus information about the extent of sexual violence against males is especially limited. Child sexual abuse is also largely underreported. Most of the data comes from asking adults about their past experiences.

One of the reasons for non-reporting is that children lack independent access to resources. They normally require the cooperation of one of their parents who may refuse to believe their child, or may, in fact, be the perpetrator.

Data on sexual violence typically come from police, clinical settings, nongovernmental organizations and survey research. The relationship between these sources and the global magnitude of the problem of sexual violence may be viewed as corresponding to an iceberg floating in water (see diagram). The small visible tip represents cases reported to police. A larger section may be elucidated through survey research and the work of nongovernmental organizations.

==Culture==
Sexual violence occurs in all cultures with varying definitions of what constitutes it. It is possible that in cultures where man and his manly role are prized better, additional perceived or real power may encourage them to think of their &quot;rights&quot;. If a woman resists sexual intercourse, it may be perceived as a direct threat by men to their masculinity, triggering a crisis of male identity and contributing to sexual control and violence as it is seen as a way of resolving this crisis. It has been reported that victims who attempt resistance or escape from the situation are more likely to be brutalized by the offender,32 thereby giving an inflated sense of power to the abuser as was seen in the New Delhi gang rape case of &quot;Nirbhaya&quot; in December 2012. It is likely that in patriarchal cultures, any resistance from the woman victim is perceived by the offender as an insult to his &quot;manhood&quot; further provoking him to resort to more violent means to control the victim.

There is a theory that explains sexual violence as socioculturally constructed which disproves the biological framework that suggests sexual violence is a result of a man&#x27;s sexual urges. This theory looks to prove that sexual violence is a natural behavior that originates from the &quot;biological propensity to reproduce have a net positive effect on the person&#x27;s (resorting to sexual violence) reproductive success. The sociocultural theory takes into account gender power equations, moral values, male dominance, and attitudes toward violence.&quot;

==Feminism==
Feminist scholars and activists have made unique contributions to the discourse on sexual violence against women and men
. They have proposed that the root causes of sexual violence lie in the social structure characterized by severe inequality, in which the male is dominant and the female exploited. Feminists also hold that the weak institutional arrangements in place to address consequences of sexual violence, as well as unfair treatment of the victims (or survivors, an alternatively proposed terminology) are direct reflections of the ways in which society regards men, women and the sexual relations between them. Furthermore, feminist critique has led to a closer convergence between feminism and psychology in the study of sexual violence.

Conveying a connection between gender-based sexual violence and concepts of power-seeking and subordination was pioneered in the 1970s and has proven to be very influential. Within this context, rape has been assessed as a foremost tool of intimidation used by men against women. Similarly, domestic violence can be viewed as a particularly severe form of patriarchal domination and oppression.

Some feminist views on pornography also suggest a link between rape and pornography, by which pornography that degrades, humiliates and exercises violence upon the female body feeds a culture which validates this kind of behavior. There are also feminists positing that certain feminist forms of pornography could actually stimulate emancipation.

An intersection of Marxist and feminist theories has been utilized to offer additional insight into the topic of sexual violence. According to this argument, labor and sex are analogous in the roles they play in their respective overarching exploitative systems: both are produced by the exploited person and both are forcefully taken away from them.

Some feminist scholars have illuminated the idea that all women cannot have uniformly similar experiences of sexual violence or its aftermath. For instance, race and ethnicity are significant determinants of these experiences, which serves to show that approaches that are exclusively feminist or exclusively anti-racist in nature are misguided. Instead, a proposition has been made for use of intersectionality when studying these cases.

Feminist ideas have served as catalysts for transnational movements to combat violence against women, including sexual violence. This agenda has also been adopted by feminist organizations, as illustrated by the current initiative titled the Rape Task Force of the National Organization for Women (NOW).

Among other countries, feminists and women&#x27;s rights activists in Egypt faced extreme challenges in combatting the grave issues of sexual violence. In 2020, the country witnessed an escalated #MeToo movement. However, it took a few months for the spark to fade. In 2021, the authorities in Egypt arrested six witnesses of a gang rape case that took place in 2014 at the country&#x27;s Cairo hotel. It highlighted the difficulties that the rights defenders were facing.

==History==

===Antiquity===

The oldest textual references to sexual violence can be traced back to, amongst other cultures, the ancient Greeks and Romans, where women were seen as property without any rights over their bodies or sexual integrity. Rape of women during peace times was therefore considered as property crime only affecting their owners: the husbands, sons or brothers. A linguistic clue can still be found in verb &quot;to rape&quot;, which derives from Latin &quot;&quot;, which originally meant &#x27;to steal, seize, rob, carry away&#x27;; any infringement or damage to a woman or girl was primarily considered to be an offence against her husband if she was married, or against her father if she was not, and a crime against the community and public morality instead of a crime against the individual woman or girl herself. Generally speaking, the victim was blamed for having put the family to shame, especially if she was not married yet and lost her virginity during the rape; many cultures tried to resolve this by allowing the rapist to marry the victim in order to restore the &#x27;family honour&#x27; of the latter. During armed conflict sexual violence, particularly rape, was perceived as a normal byproduct of war, as &quot;a socially acceptable behavior well within the rules of warfare&quot;. In Ancient Greece, women were sometimes the reason for the attack of a city, conquering women as new wives or concubines, legitimate booty, as slaves or as trophies. The fact that sexual violence to women was commonplace during both war and peace times led to the negligence of any indications of what the methods, aims and magnitude of such violence was; it was face- and nameless.

===Middle Ages and early modern period===
The European Middle Ages strongly reflected a patriarchal view of sexual violence. During times of peace, female spouses had no right to refuse sex with their husbands. Even though laws punishing rapes existed, sexual violence was usually considered as justified or inconsequential. Usually, depending on the elite&#x27;s views, which perceived sexual violence as a minor issue, sexual violence was not prosecuted. This view was also transferred to the colonies. In Alta California, for example, the Catholic clergy relied heavily on corporal punishment such as flogging, placing in the stocks or shackling of Amerindian women within their programs of Christianization. Within this context of trying to restore a certain social order, women were often the victims of sexual violence if politically active and posing a threat to the existing order. With regard to times of war, jurists, writers and scholars argued that as soon as war is just, no boundaries would be set towards methods used in order to achieve victory. However, with Alberico Gentili (1552–1608) discussions started that suffering of women should be reduced and rape prohibited during peace and war times. However, this view was not accepted for a long time, as women and children not participating in the fighting were still considered as being the enemy and the patriarchal view on women prevailed during peace and war times.

===Codification of laws of war on gender-related crimes (c. 1800–1945)===
Gradually, over the centuries laws and customs of war changed in direction of a wider understanding of sexual violence and the need to protect potential victims. During the American Civil War (1861–1865), the US started to codify the customary rules regulating land-based wars. On 24 April 1863, President Abraham Lincoln tried to &quot;inter alia&quot; regulate the sexual conduct of Union soldiers towards civilians in hostile territory with the Lieber Code, which contained one of the first explicit prohibitions on rape. Paragraphs 44 and 47 of the Lieber Code contained provisions prohibiting several crimes including &quot;all rape&quot; by an American soldier in a hostile country against its inhabitants &quot;under the penalty of death, or such other severe punishment as may seem adequate for the gravity of the offense.&quot; Thus, the only enforcement mechanisms were the military commanders themselves, having the right to execute the soldiers immediately.

Scholars usually interpret Article 46 of the Annex to the Convention (IV) respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land of the Second Hague Convention (18 October 1907), which stipulated that &quot;Family honour and rights ... must be respected&quot;, to be an implicit prohibition of sexual assault or rape. However, because sexual assault was once again conceptualised as a crime of honour against the family instead of a violent crime against the individual person, Clack (2018) regarded this provision as &quot;a step backwards from the Lieber Code&quot;.

After World War I, a War Crimes Commission was established in order to bring war criminals before justice. Forced prostitution and rape was seen as grave violation of the customs and laws of war. After World War II (1939–1945), under the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg (IMT) and the International Military Tribunal for the Far East at Tokyo (IMTFE), the spectrum of sexual violence as war crime was widened even though rape was not explicitly mentioned in the final verdicts. The transcripts of the trials did contain evidence of rape, sexual slavery, sexual sadism, sexual torture, sexual mutilation, forced sterilization, forced abortion, forced nudity, forced pornography and forced prostitution. But only after the Tokyo Tribunal, when Japanese commanders were prosecuted – for the first time based on the chain of command – for not having prevented rape and sexual slavery of comfort women during the Second World War, was sexual violence gradually considered as a grave war crime in itself. This view was expressed for the first time after Nuremberg and Tokyo in the second series of trials for the prosecution of &quot;lesser&quot; war criminals in Allied-occupied Germany, where the Allied (Article II §1.c), enacted on 20 December 1945, explicitly listed rape as constituting a &quot;crime against humanity&quot;.

===International legal framework (after 1945)===

After 1945, an extensive amount of both hard and soft law instruments have set rules, standards and norms for the protection of victims of sexual offences. These include the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW, United Nations 1979); the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (United Nations June 1993); Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women (United Nations December 1993); the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against Women (Belém do Pará Convention) (Organization of American States 1994); the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa (Maputo Protocol) (African Union 2003), and the Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention) (Council of Europe 2011).

The resulting, ever growing body of international humanitarian law (IHL) strongly prohibits sexual violence in all armed conflicts, and international human rights law (IHRL) and international customary law strongly prohibit it at all times. IHL ensures women are protected through a two-tiered approach, being covered by general (equal protection as men) and specific protections. IHL mandates special protections to women, according to their additional needs when they are more vulnerable, such as widows, the sick and wounded, migrants, the internally displaced, or those held in detention. Meanwhile, second-wave feminists launched the anti-rape movement in the 1960s and 1970s, leading to national legal prohibitions on marital rape by most countries around the world by the 2010s, while marry-your-rapist laws were increasingly abolished in the same decades.

Groundbreaking case law both by the &quot;ad hoc&quot; Tribunals of International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia (ICTY) established acts of rape and sexual violence as crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity. ICTR&#x27;s conviction of Jean-Paul Akayesu for genocide and crimes against humanity on 2 September 1998 is the first case in which sexual violence is perceived as an integral part of genocide as defined in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The first trial solely focused on the perpetration of systematic sexual violence (rape camps) and on crimes against humanity committed against women and girls was the Foča case, a ruling before the ICTY. The Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) also explicitly incorporates rape and other forms of sexual violence in the list of war crimes and therefore recognizes sexual violence as a grave breach of IHL and of the Geneva Conventions.

The UN Security Council, ECOSOC and the UN Commission on Human Rights do not take into account the nature of the conflict with respect to the protection of women in war time. Three reports from the UN Secretary-General and five UN Security Council resolutions specifically address sexual violence. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1888 (2009), in particular, created the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary General for Sexual Violence in Conflict (SRSG-SVC). The Office highlighted six priorities and identified eight priority countries: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Central African Republic (CAR), Colombia, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Liberia, South Sudan, and Sudan. SRSG-SVC is also engaged in the Middle East (Syria) and in Asia and the Pacific (Cambodia). Despite strong prohibitions of international law, enforcement mechanisms against sexual violence are fragile or do not exist in many parts of the world.

== Today ==

Sexual violence against women in modern warfare constitutes a grave violation of human rights, with devastating consequences that persist long after conflicts cease. In conflicts such as the Bosnian War in the 1990s, women endured widespread sexual violence, including systematic rape camps, as a tool of ethnic cleansing. The Rwandan Genocide in 1994 also saw the use of sexual violence as a weapon, with an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 women experiencing sexual assault.

The conflict in Syria has witnessed a disturbing pattern of sexual violence, including rape, forced marriage, and human trafficking. The Yazidi women in Iraq faced horrific atrocities at the hands of ISIS, experiencing sexual slavery and systemic violence.

During Hamas&#x27; surprise attack on Israel, acts of sexual violence against Israelis have been reported, including rape, mutilation and torture. Similar atrocities have been reported against Palestinians, including rape, sexualized torture and mutilation.

<text>Iain Murray Rose, (6 January 1939 – 15 April 2012) was an Australian swimmer, who swam for the University of Southern California, and worked as an actor, sports commentator and marketing executive. He was a six-time Olympic medalist (four gold, one silver, one bronze), and at one time held the world records in the 400-metre, 800-metre, and 1500-metre freestyle (long course). He made his Olympic debut at the 1956 Summer Olympics as a 17-year-old and won three Olympic medals, all gold. Four years later, as a 21-year-old, he won three Olympic medals (one gold, one silver, one bronze) at the 1960 Summer Olympics.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Iain Murray Rose was born on 6 January 1939 in Birmingham, England to parents Eileen and Ian Rose. As World War II broke out, his family moved to Australia in 1940 when he was a baby. He started swimming as a boy and attended Cranbrook School in Bellevue Hill, Sydney. He swam regularly at Redleaf Pool, an enclosed saltwater swimming pool in the suburb of Double Bay. In 2012, the pool was renamed Murray Rose Pool in his honour.

===Career===
At the age of 17, Rose participated in the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. He won the 400-metre and 1500-metre freestyle races and was a member of the winning team in the 4×200-metre freestyle relay. Winning three gold medals in his home country immediately made him a national hero. He was the youngest Olympian to be awarded three gold medals in one Olympic Games. Afterwards, Rose moved to the United States to accept an athletic scholarship at the University of Southern California (USC) where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Business/Communications.

He continued competing while at USC, and graduated in 1962. At the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy, Rose again won an Olympic gold medal in the 400m freestyle, as well as a silver in the 1500m freestyle and a bronze in the freestyle relay, bringing his haul to six Olympic medals. In addition to his Olympic medals, he won four gold medals at the 1962 Commonwealth Games in Perth, Western Australia. He eventually set 15 world records, including the world record in the 800-metre freestyle in 1962, which was not broken until Semyon Belits-Geiman set a new record in 1966. Rose missed the 1964 Tokyo Olympics as he was attending university in the United States at the time of Australia&#x27;s Olympic trials and so was omitted from their Olympic team; he had set world records for 880 yard and 1,500 metre freestyle event earlier in the months before the Games and would have been a medal favourite.

During the 1960s, he also pursued an acting career, starring in two Hollywood films and making guest appearances on television shows such as &quot;Adventure Unlimited&quot;.

In addition, Rose worked as an Australian sports commentator for the Nine Network, plus each of the major US networks, participating in seven consecutive Olympic Games.

Rose continued to compete as a masters swimmer. In 1981 he won the World Masters title in faster times than he recorded at the 1956 Games.

From 1988 to 1994, Rose was vice-president of California Sports Marketing specialising in marketing, sponsorships and promotions for the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team and special events at the Great Western Forum.

He returned to Sydney with his family in 1994 and worked as a Senior Account Director for Sports Marketing and Management – the official marketing agent for the Australian Olympic Committee, the Australian Commonwealth Games Association and a range of other leading Australian sports organisations.

An avenue at Sydney Olympic Park was named for him in 2000. He was one of the eight flag-bearers of the Olympic Flag at the 2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in Sydney.

In 2010, Rose led a team on a pilgrimage for Military History Tours to Gallipoli and a 4.5 km swim from Europe to Asia across the Dardanelles.

In 2012, Redleaf Pool in Double Bay, Sydney, was officially renamed Murray Rose Pool in his honour. In 2022 Cranbrook School named its new swimming complex on New South Head Road the Murray Rose Aquatic &amp; Fitness Centre.

===Work in film and television===
In 1958 he appeared on &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; where he was baffled by the world geography questions. On 6 January 1959, Rose appeared as a guest challenger on the TV panel show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; where he stumped the panel as they all voted for the wrong person.

He made his acting debut in the 1962 Australian live drama &quot;My Three Angels&quot;. He also guest starred in an episode of &quot;Adventure Unlimited&quot;.

Later he starred in the 1964 surf movie &quot;Ride the Wild Surf&quot; and in &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot; in 1968. He also made periodic appearances in television and film including guest spots on &quot;Dr Kildare&quot;, &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;, &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot;, &quot;Dream Rider&quot;, &quot;Time Capsule 1932&quot; and &quot;Time Capsule 1938&quot;.

===Charity===
Rose held a number of cause-related Board positions including the Mary MacKillop Foundation and Patron of Rainbow Club Australia, a non-profit charity providing children with special needs the opportunity to explore their abilities through sporting and recreational activities. In 2012, Rainbow Club Australia renamed their annual event, The Murray Rose&#x27;s Malabar Magic Ocean Swim. The MRMM offers a two swim program of 1 km and 2.4 km

===Honours===
He was among the first swimmers inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame, in 1965, was voted Australia&#x27;s greatest male Olympian by his peers in 1983, and inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985.

Rose was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in 2000 for services to swimming. He also received the Australian Sports Medal that year and, in 2001, he was awarded the Centenary Medal.
In 2023, he was inducted into the Swimming Australia Hall of Fame.

===Books===
Murray Rose&#x27;s father, Ian F Rose, published Faith, Love, and Seaweed about his son&#x27;s childhood and diet.
In 2013, Murray Rose&#x27;s memoir &quot;Life is Worth Swimming&quot; was posthumously published. Written before his leukaemia diagnosis, &quot;Life is Worth Swimming&quot; reflects on Rose&#x27;s life and experiences as an Olympic swimmer.

===Personal life===
Rose married ballerina Jodi Wintz on 20 October 1988. Their son was born in 1990. He was previously married to Bobbie Whitby and he adopted her daughter.

Rose was a strict vegetarian in his swimming days – this earned him the nickname &quot;The Seaweed Streak&quot; – but he later added meat to his diet.

Rose died of leukaemia on 15 April 2012 at the age of 73 in Sydney, New South Wales.

<doc id="731640" wikidata="Q1638872" url="?curid=731640" title="Document retrieval">
<text>Document retrieval is defined as the matching of some stated user query against a set of free-text records. These records could be any type of mainly unstructured text, such as newspaper articles, real estate records or paragraphs in a manual. User queries can range from multi-sentence full descriptions of an information need to a few words.

Document retrieval is sometimes referred to as, or as a branch of, text retrieval. Text retrieval is a branch of information retrieval where the information is stored primarily in the form of text. Text databases became decentralized thanks to the personal computer. Text retrieval is a critical area of study today, since it is the fundamental basis of all internet search engines.

==Description==
Document retrieval systems find information to given criteria by matching text records (&quot;documents&quot;) against user queries, as opposed to expert systems that answer questions by inferring over a logical knowledge database. A document retrieval system consists of a database of documents, a classification algorithm to build a full text index, and a user interface to access the database.

A document retrieval system has two main tasks:
# Find relevant documents to user queries
# Evaluate the matching results and sort them according to relevance, using algorithms such as PageRank.

Internet search engines are classical applications of document retrieval. The vast majority of retrieval systems currently in use range from simple Boolean systems through to systems using statistical or natural language processing techniques.

==Variations==
There are two main classes of indexing schemata for document retrieval systems: &quot;form based&quot; (or &quot;word based&quot;), and &quot;content based&quot; indexing. The document classification scheme (or indexing algorithm) in use determines the nature of the document retrieval system.

===Form based===
Form based document retrieval addresses the exact syntactic properties of a text, comparable to substring matching in string searches. The text is generally unstructured and not necessarily in a natural language, the system could for example be used to process large sets of chemical representations in molecular biology. A suffix tree algorithm is an example for form based indexing.

===Content based===
The content based approach exploits semantic connections between documents and parts thereof, and semantic connections between queries and documents. Most content based document retrieval systems use an inverted index algorithm.

A &quot;signature file&quot; is a technique that creates a &quot;quick and dirty&quot; filter, for example a Bloom filter, that will keep all the documents that match to the query and &quot;hopefully&quot; a few ones that do not. The way this is done is by creating for each file a signature, typically a hash coded version. One method is superimposed coding. A post-processing step is done to discard the false alarms. Since in most cases this structure is inferior to inverted files in terms of speed, size and functionality, it is not used widely. However, with proper parameters it can beat the inverted files in certain environments.

==Example: PubMed==
The PubMed form interface features the &quot;related articles&quot; search which works through a comparison of words from the documents&#x27; title, abstract, and MeSH terms using a word-weighted algorithm.

<text>Funky Winkerbean was an American comic strip by Tom Batiuk. Distributed by North America Syndicate, a division of King Features Syndicate, it appeared in more than 400 newspapers worldwide.

While Batiuk was a 23-year-old middle school art teacher in Elyria, Ohio, he began drawing cartoons while supervising study hall. In 1970, his characters first appeared as a weekly panel, &quot;Rapping Around&quot;, on the teenage page of the &quot;Elyria Chronicle Telegram&quot;. In 1972, Batiuk reworked some of the characters into a daily strip, which he sold to Publishers-Hall Syndicate.

Throughout its 50-year run, the strip went through several format changes. For the first 20 years of its run, the characters did not age, and the strip was nominally episodic as opposed to a serial, with humor derived from visual gags and the eccentricity of the characters. In 1992, Batiuk rebooted the strip, establishing that the characters had graduated from high school in 1988 (although later strips showed them graduating in 1972), and the series began progressing in real time. In 2007, a second &quot;time warp&quot; occurred, this time taking the strip ten years into the future, ostensibly to 2017, although the events of the strip still reflected a then-contemporary setting. Following the 1992 reboot and especially after the 2007 time jump, the strip was recast as a serialized drama, though most strips still featured some humor, often based on wordplay. The more drama-oriented &quot;Funky Winkerbean&quot; featured story arcs revolving around such topics as terminal cancer, adoption, prisoners of war, drug abuse, post-traumatic stress, same-sex couples attending the senior prom, and interracial marriage.

On November 17, 2022, Batiuk announced that he would be retiring the strip at the end of the year. &quot;Funky Winkerbean&quot; ended on December 31, 2022, but many of the strip&#x27;s characters—including Funky himself—then began to be seen regularly in Batiuk&#x27;s long-running spin-off strip &quot;Crankshaft&quot;.

==Characters and story==
Centered at Westview High School, influenced by Batiuk&#x27;s alma mater of Midview High School near Grafton, Ohio, the strip initially focused on several students: Funky Winkerbean, Crazy Harry Klinghorn, Barry Balderman, &quot;Bull&quot; Bushka, Cindy Summers, Junebug, Roland, Livinia, Leslie P. &quot;Les&quot; Moore, majorette Holly Budd (daughter of Melinda Budd, original majorette for Westview High), and Lisa Crawford.

From 1972 to 1992, the strip was highly gag-oriented, with humor coming from physical and prop comedy and surreal situations: running gags included the school&#x27;s computer having become sentient and subjecting the students to its obsession with &quot;Star Trek&quot;; student &quot;Crazy&quot; Harry&#x27;s ability to play pizzas like records; the school&#x27;s winless football team; and band director Harry L. Dinkle&#x27;s attempts to win each year&#x27;s &quot;Battle of the Bands,&quot; despite the contest always coinciding with a natural disaster (usually heavy rain).

Although the titular everyman Funky Winkerbean was the ostensible main character, nerds Les Moore and Lisa Crawford became breakout characters and the strip&#x27;s primary focus. Supporting characters included obsessive majorette Holly (who never removed her uniform), &quot;Crazy&quot; Harry (who lived in his locker), Jerome T. &quot;Bull&quot; Bushka (the school&#x27;s star athlete and Les&#x27;s tormentor), and popular girl Cindy. Rounding out the cast was the Westview High staff, including Principal Burch, counselor Fred Fairgood, secretary Betty Reynolds (who actually ran the school), football coach John &quot;Jack&quot; Stropp and Dinkle.

The name &quot;Funky Winkerbean&quot; was a composite from suggestions from some of Batiuk&#x27;s art students.

==1992 relaunch==
In 1992, Batiuk changed the strip&#x27;s format. It was established that Funky, Les, Cindy and all the rest of the previous cast had graduated from Westview in 1988; their college years were skipped, and the story continued in their adulthood. Subsequently, the characters aged in real time and underwent significant life changes. Funky married Cindy in 1998; they later divorced. Les and Lisa married in a Halloween-themed 1996 story that saw them dressed as Batman and Robin. Funky now co-owned the local pizza parlor with Tony Montoni, Les taught English at Westview, Crazy Harry was the local mailman, Bull the Scapegoats&#x27; coach, and Cindy a national-level television newscaster. The strip followed their stories as well as those of a new generation at Westview, including Wally, Becky, Darin and Monroe. Overtly whimsical elements were now downplayed, and some of the series&#x27; running gags from the 1972–92 years were recast in a more serious light. For instance, Bull&#x27;s hectoring of Les became the focus of a storyline on domestic violence and child abuse when it was revealed that Bull abused Les to cope with being abused by his own father.

Though humorous storylines remained a mainstay, the strip also examined subjects more traditionally associated with soap opera or serialized comics. Most notably, a teenage pregnancy storyline had Lisa becoming pregnant as a teenager; she placed the child for adoption. Her child, Darin, grew up with his adopted family and became a regular character. Other storylines dealt with suicide, teen dating violence, capital punishment, alcoholism (Funky himself struggled with alcoholism and recovery), and other grim subjects.

Perhaps the most widely discussed storylines involved characters who went through catastrophic suffering. In 2005, Batiuk sent newlyweds Wally Winkerbean and Becky to Afghanistan as a part of an anti-landmine effort by the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation; Wally nearly died after stepping on a mine. He was saved when his Afghan companion Kahn managed to knock the mine away, only to be punched out for selling the Stinger that killed his fellow troops. The couple returned to the US with an adopted daughter, Rana, who was left orphaned after her family was killed by a suicide bomber. 

Even more attention was focused on the ongoing suffering and eventual death of Lisa Crawford Moore.

===Lisa&#x27;s story===

A recurring storyline for many years was Lisa Moore&#x27;s battle with breast cancer. She first dealt with it when diagnosed in 1999. Soon after, she learned that Holly Budd was also a breast cancer survivor. After going through chemotherapy and a mastectomy, Lisa&#x27;s cancer went into remission. 

In March 2006, Lisa&#x27;s cancer returned in a more serious form. Following another round of chemotherapy, her cancer appeared to go into remission again in early 2007, but on May 9, 2007, her doctor revealed that her medical charts had gotten mixed up and her disease was not only progressing, but had become inoperable. In a King Features press release, it was revealed that &quot;Lisa will start chemo again, learn that her long-range prospects are poor, stop chemotherapy, deal with telling her daughter about her cancer situation, [and] testify before Congress about the need for cancer research and cope with friends and family.&quot; Batiuk was very open about the fact that Lisa&#x27;s latest ordeal would end with her death and some of the events that would happen as a result.

The series polarized the comics community, with Batiuk being both praised for dealing with the topic and criticized for his graphic depiction of Lisa&#x27;s slow deterioration and ultimate death. The entire storyline, which culminated with Lisa&#x27;s death in the October 4, 2007, strip (excerpt at right), was collected and published in a book, &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Story: The Other Shoe&quot;. This book, which includes the strips from Lisa&#x27;s initial battle with cancer (which had itself been collected in book form in 2004), was published before the series had finished running in syndication. In 2007, Batiuk discussed his reasoning for pursuing the plotline, saying that he was inspired by his own battle against prostate cancer.

==Second time jump==

On October 21, 2007, &quot;Funky Winkerbean&quot; underwent its second &quot;time warp,&quot; this time jumping 10 years ahead from Lisa&#x27;s death and aging the cast of characters accordingly; those that were children are now high school age, and the original cast are in their mid-forties. Readers got a preview of the new-look feature starting with the October 5 strip in which a middle-aged widower Les talks to an unseen psychologist about events that immediately followed Lisa&#x27;s passing, which are then depicted in flashback form. The October 21 strip shows a younger Les talking with Summer about death in general to help her understand that of Lisa&#x27;s, before switching to the new-look Moores in the closing frames, and the first week of strips that followed, following the Moores participating in a Making Strides walk, have a banner saying &quot;Act III: Ten Years Later&quot; in the first frame (an &quot;Act III&quot; statement directing readers to the official website was discreetly included in fine print for some time afterward).

The relaunched &quot;Funky&quot;, Batiuk said, &quot;is going to be a different strip, a little bit quieter.&quot; He also promised that despite Lisa&#x27;s death, she will remain a presence in strip through flashbacks, remembrances, and a series of videos she recorded for daughter Summer just before she died. Montoni&#x27;s will have opened several locations, including in New York City, Summer will have grown into a popular 15-year-old basketball star (in contrast to her geeky father), and Bull&#x27;s adopted daughter Jinx, as well as Becky&#x27;s adopted daughter Rana, are high-school aged. Batiuk explained that he wanted the comic to move so far ahead in order to prevent it from being an extended grieving process, to ensure that the next generation of students he followed were related to the original cast of characters, and to bring his original characters&#x27; ages closer to his target audience&#x27;s. After the flash forward, all the strip&#x27;s prominent adult male characters—Funky, Les, Bull and Crazy Harry—are 46 years old.

===Major storylines===
While a few of the mainstay elements—most notably, storylines revolving around the Westview High School band and now-retired director Harry Dinkle, and classroom spot gags—reappear in Act III on occasion, the focus once again is on dramatic storylines with continuing story arcs:

====Return of Wally Winkerbean====
Wally Winkerbean—who had returned to Iraq before the relaunch—is not in the core cast as shown on the Funky Winkerbean Web site, and it was also revealed that Becky had remarried (John Howard, owner of the Comics Emporium) sometime in the 10 years after Lisa&#x27;s death. For nearly two years after the relaunch, Wally&#x27;s fate remained unknown, although early on, Batiuk wrote on his blog that what happened to Wally &quot;may not be what you think happened.&quot; Batiuk also revealed that a &quot;clue&quot; to Wally&#x27;s fate could be found in the October 11 strip, which features Les getting mugged in New York after Lisa&#x27;s death after walking past a newspaper vending machine with a headline saying &quot;Soldiers Taken Hostage.&quot;

Several strips made allusions to Wally&#x27;s disappearance, including one featuring Becky Howard&#x27;s car having a POW/MIA bumper sticker and her placing a U.S. flag on an unidentified grave. In the July 12, 2009, strip, it is finally shown that Wally is alive and in full military uniform; a backstory reveals that Funky got a call from his ex-wife, Cindy, informing him that Wally was alive and that she had conducted an interview that was to air on the news that evening. It is revealed that Wally has been held as a prisoner of war in Iraq for the past decade (possibly taken hostage around the time of Lisa&#x27;s death), and—unaware that he was presumed dead and that Becky had remarried—said during that interview that what kept him sane during his time in captivity was thinking about his wife and family. Funky visits the Howards to reveal that Wally is alive and in good health. In the August 9, 2009, strip, it is revealed that the grave Becky had visited all these years was that of Wally&#x27;s assumed remains. Wally has made occasional appearances since his return to Westview, and his first appearance as a central character in a storyline that began on February 1, 2010.

====Other storylines====
Darin Fairgood, another prominent character who appeared in the strip throughout the 1990s and 2000s, had also been unseen since the 2007 relaunch, but reappeared in the April 1, 2008 strip helping his old high school buddy Pete Roberts move back into town. Pete is the latest resident of the apartment above Montoni&#x27;s. Les and Lisa lived there before buying their home. Becky and Wally took it over, and then apparently during the time jump John and Becky lived there together before John turned it into a storage space for his comics, probably since the basement shop has flooded in the past.

During 2010, Funky became the central character in a storyline in which he has a flashback to his high school days 30 years earlier in Westview. The flashback ran concurrently with a storyline where Funky was seriously injured in a car accident, caused by a young woman whose car veers into the path of Funky&#x27;s car while she was talking on a cellphone while driving. During several flashback scenes, Funky had seen (and in some cases, visited with) teen-aged versions of himself, Crazy Harry and Holly Budd (Funky&#x27;s wife-to-be), and a younger Mr. Dinkle—all as they appeared in &quot;Funky Winkerbean &quot; strips in the early 1980s. Although the recovery aspect of the accident storyline continued into the fall, the flashback scenes ended when Funky regained consciousness at the hospital.

A storyline that began in April 2012 featured a same-sex couple wanting to go to Westview High School&#x27;s prom together and purchasing tickets from Jinx Bushka, a member of the Senior Prom committee. The story explored the reaction from Westview residents, most notably anti-LBGT activist and head of the Senior Prom parent volunteers Roberta Blackburn, who launches an effort to stop the couple from attending prom by forming a protest outside the school. When a group of students led by Summer Moore supporting LBGT couples attending the prom plan a counter-protest, principal Nate Green defuses the situation by calling a school assembly and announces that gay couples will be allowed to attend the prom, and that he will not have intolerance at Westview High School be a policy issue during his tenure.

Some time after Lisa&#x27;s death, Les begins dating Cayla Williams, a black teacher at Westview High. Their relationship blossoms into love and in the fall of 2012, the two were married. Also that fall, Les&#x27;s daughter, Summer, and Cayla&#x27;s daughter, Keisha, begin attending college. In April 2013, a storyline began revolving around Darin Fairgood&#x27;s biological father, Frankie, attempting to meet his biological son; this coincided with the release of Les&#x27;s book &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Story&quot;, detailing her life, battle with breast cancer and events since her death. Frankie eventually meets with Darin, attempting to blackmail him into doing a reality series about their reunion, but Les, Cayla and the rest of the gang—aware that the show&#x27;s only objective was to tarnish Lisa&#x27;s name and character—help Darin thwart Frankie&#x27;s plans.

In January 2013, Fred Fairgood—now retired as principal of Westview High—suffered a major stroke and was barely alive at the hospital; he is later shown to be recovering at home, although he is disabled. As Fred is beginning his recovery, a woman identifying herself as Fred&#x27;s daughter (from a previous relationship, before he married Ann) shows up at the hospital and proves that she is indeed his biological daughter. Ann Fairgood is forced to admit that her marriage to Fred was not the happy one they had made it out to be publicly and that they shielded Darin from their unhappiness, upsetting Darin to the point he estranges himself from the family.

In 2011, before Fred Fairgood fell ill, another longtime Westview staff member—Jock Strapp, the former football coach and physical education teacher—had died of prostate cancer, although this was acknowledged only briefly.

In 2013 Funky&#x27;s wife Holly—whose son Cory is in Afghanistan—finds that he has an old &quot;Starbuck Jones&quot; comic book collection and begins collecting missing issues to make the collection complete; she soon has issues #7; #123; #54; #104; #36 (on eBay); #216; and in July 2014 during a week-long cliffhanger searches for the rare and elusive #115. First missing it at a comic book convention and then losing it when her credit card would not work, she finally finds #115, along with an equally rare &quot;Ashcan&quot; version (a penciled version of a comic strip before the final printing). When a couple gives her a &quot;Starbuck Jones&quot; comic book Holly presents them with a &quot;Holy Grail&quot; of &quot;Action Comics&quot; #243.

During the summer of 2015, the present-day incarnations of the Westview gang meet up with their teen-aged selves during a class reunion; it is revealed in the storyline&#x27;s finale that Les—who helped organize the event—had passed out during the reunion (for unexplained reasons) and was having a dream.

In 2019, Bull dealt with the effects of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The storyline included Bull&#x27;s death.

===Continuity with other strips===
The continuity of the &quot;Crankshaft&quot; strip is as much as 20 years behind that of &quot;Funky Winkerbean&quot;; strips in both comics in August and September 2011 show Cayla Williams, a high school teacher and secretary to Principal Nate Green and Les&#x27;s fiancée, with Keisha her teenage daughter, to be a college-age student in the former. In the January 27, 2015, installment of &quot;Funky Winkerbean&quot;, a throwback crossover shows &quot;Crankshaft&quot; as a bus driver, while &quot;Crankshaft&quot; also has a throwback crossover that shows &quot;Crankshaft&quot; as a bus driver on &quot;Funky Winkerbean&quot;. This time difference between the strips was gradually retconned away as &quot;Funky Winkerbean&quot; finished its run in 2022, with the characters crossing over more frequently through the year in the same timeframe, culminating in the week leading up to Christmas showing characters traveling to and meeting up at a church choir concert in &quot;Crankshaft&#x27;s&quot; Centerville.

On January 19, 2015, &quot;Funky Winkerbean&quot; began a crossover with &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; when two of the &quot;Winkerbean&quot; characters decided to attend a police auction of stolen comic books recovered from the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; criminal the &quot;Jumbler&quot;. &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; has a concurrent crossover with &quot;Funky Winkerbean&quot; concerning the comic book auction.

==Third time jump (the final week)==
Funky and the rest of the cast last appeared on the Christmas Day 2022 episode. The final week was set in the late 21st century. Summer&#x27;s granddaughter (also named Lisa) found two books in a robot-staffed bookstore; &quot;Westview&quot;, written by Summer, and &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Story: The Other Shoe&quot;, written by Les. It was explained that a mass book burning had taken place in the past, but somehow these books survived, and Summer was famous due to the success of &quot;Westview&quot;. The last episode saw Lisa&#x27;s mother telling her to retire for the night, and the final panel had both books on Lisa&#x27;s bed. John Byrne did the art for the final week.

==Controversy==
The more dramatic turns of the storyline have led to mixed responses from readers. Negative reaction to a 2007 strip featuring Wally getting blown up by an I.E.D. (which turned out in the next strip to be him playing a computer game), included two papers that ran the strip receiving irate phone calls and letters to the editor, and led to Batiuk issuing an apology soon after the strip ran.

Reactions to later chapters of Lisa&#x27;s Story led to further complaints over the comic&#x27;s gloomy content, and Batiuk has mentioned in interviews that he has received complaints about the direction of the storyline. Web comic &quot;Shortpacked&quot; produced a satirical strip in which most of the words of &quot;Funky Winkerbean&quot; characters&#x27; dialogue are replaced by the word &quot;cancer.&quot; The Comics Curmudgeon also makes frequent reference to the seemingly unremitting gloom of the strip, calling it &quot;a black hole of bleakness and depression and cancer from which no joy or laughter can escape.&quot; The strip has also inspired a blog, &quot;Son of Stuck Funky&quot;, which provides a daily commentary.

A &quot;Crankshaft&quot; strip from May 23, 2007, sarcastically addresses the controversy from Batiuk&#x27;s perspective, with a character remarking of newspaper comic strips that &quot;everyone knows they&#x27;re supposed to be funny&quot;. In the &quot;Funky Winkerbean&quot; strip published on September 30, 2007, Les essentially echoes the &quot;Crankshaft&quot; comment.

In a September 2009 storyline that many readers also interpreted as Batiuk&#x27;s addressing of the strip&#x27;s latter-day bleakness, a group of parents protested a school production of &quot;Wit&quot; because the themes of cancer and death offended them. In her defense of the play, the character of Susan Smith, a Westview High teacher and drama director, was viewed by critics as a mouthpiece for Batiuk&#x27;s views on the importance of dramatic entertainment.

Over the week of July 7, 2008, &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot; parodied the tendency of &quot;Funky Winkerbean&quot; towards killing off main characters when it killed off Rat and the strip&#x27;s own author, Stephan Pastis (the two would later be returned to the strip via the intervention of the head of United Feature Syndicate), with Tom Batiuk even allowing Pastis to use his representation of the Angel of Death in the second to last strip in the series. A year earlier, as part of a long series featuring multiple storylines, Pastis remarked to Pig that serial strips handle long stories better and featured Funky, Holly, Lisa, and Les in a parody referencing, among other things, Lisa&#x27;s breast cancer. Pastis was given Batiuk&#x27;s blessing to run the strip, but just before it was scheduled to run the controversy over the cancer storyline grew to the point where Pastis pulled it from publication as he believed, although he never mentioned the disease by name, anyone who read his strip could infer that he was making light of cancer patients and Pastis did not wish to have &quot;Pearls&quot; drawn into the controversy.

==Spinoffs==
Two minor characters have been spun off into their own strips: the bus driver &quot;Crankshaft&quot; in 1987 and the talk show host &quot;John Darling&quot; in 1979. The latter ended in 1990 when Batiuk had Darling murdered in the penultimate strip after a real-life financial dispute with the strip&#x27;s syndicator. In &quot;Funky Winkerbean&quot;, Les Moore wrote a book about Darling&#x27;s murder and solved the case in a 1997 storyline.

==Comic book connections==
Batiuk&#x27;s neighbor, comic book writer Tony Isabella, occasionally appears in the strip as himself. Another comic book creator, superhero artist John Byrne, drew ten weeks of the strip while Batiuk was recovering from foot surgery and has appeared in the strip himself as a character.

Batiuk also occasionally parodies covers of classic Silver Age comics to comment on storyline elements in the strip itself. This is usually done in the Sunday comic and features a cover and a current storyline being highlighted. An example is the October 27, 2013 strip, which featured the cover of Superboy Volume 1, #57. This cover showed the title character playing many positions in baseball, highlighting the then-current storyline where Bull Bushka is Westview High School&#x27;s Athletic Director, Girls Basketball Coach, and was named the school&#x27;s head football coach.
Montoni&#x27;s Pizza is modeled after Luigi&#x27;s, an Italian restaurant and pizzeria in downtown Akron, Ohio. There is a framed and signed &quot;Funky Winkerbean&quot; strip hung in the restaurant. The band box frequently shown in the interior of the shop above the entrance is an actual fixture in the restaurant.

After the second time skip, Batiuk designed the comic book store around the shop he frequents, Ground Zero Comics and Cards in Strongsville, Ohio. Captain America&#x27;s shield that is frequently shown in the background is on the mantel in the shop.

The character Harry L. Dinkle, the self-proclaimed &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Band Director,&quot; is based on the director of The Ohio State University Marching Band. Professor Dinkle is based on a composite of past directors Dr. Paul Droste and Dr. Jon Woods. In addition, a 2006 article from the &quot;Cleveland Free Times&quot; asserts that Harry L. Dinkle is based on Harry Pfingsten, a retired band director from Avon Lake, Ohio, who was the band director of the junior high school that Tom Batiuk attended. In 1989, Harry L. Dinkle was the first comic strip character ever to &quot;march&quot; the Tournament of Roses
parade. Dinkles, a brand of shoe designed for marching bands, is named after the character and claims to have been endorsed by Dinkle since 1986.

==Musical==
Batiuk assisted in the writing of a stage musical adaptation of the strip, entitled &quot;Funky Winkerbean&#x27;s Homecoming&quot;, set in the era while Funky was a Westview High student. It was performed by at least one high school drama group, beginning in 1988. Despite the title, Funky is actually a fairly minor character in the play; the focal character of &quot;Funky Winkerbean&#x27;s Homecoming&quot; is Les Moore.

The musical was co-written by Andy Clark, who much later appeared as himself in the comic strip in December 2006. Clark is a publisher of the C. L. Barnhouse Company, and has published several &quot;Funky Winkerbean&quot; collections dedicated to the character of Harry L. Dinkle.

<text>The red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata) is a passerine bird native to southern Australia. At in length, it is the second largest species of Australian honeyeater. It has mainly grey-brown plumage, with red eyes, distinctive pinkish-red wattles on either side of the neck, white streaks on the chest and a large bright yellow patch on the lower belly. The sexes are similar in plumage. Juveniles have less prominent wattles and browner eyes. John White described the red wattlebird in 1790. Three subspecies are recognized.

The species is found in southeast Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and southwest Western Australia in open forest and woodlands, and is a common visitor to urban gardens and parks. Loud and conspicuous, the red wattlebird is generally found in trees, where it gets most of its food; occasionally it forages on the ground. It is one of the largest nectarivorous birds in the world, feeding from a wide variety of flowering plants. Insects also comprise part of its diet. It is territorial and at times aggressive towards birds of other species, often defending rich sources of nectar. Breeding throughout its range, the red wattlebird builds a cup-shaped nest in a tree and raises one or two broods a year. Although it has declined in places from land-clearing, it is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.

==Taxonomy==
The red wattlebird was first described as the wattled bee-eater by the Irish surgeon and naturalist John White in his &quot;Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales&quot;, which was published in 1790. He wrote that it was the &quot;size of a missel thrush, but much larger in proportion&quot;. The taxonomic descriptions in White&#x27;s book are believed to have been written by the English naturalist George Shaw, who is generally credited as the author by subsequent authorities. The specific epithet, &quot;carunculata&quot;, was introduced later in the same year by John Latham. The word is derived from &quot;caruncula&quot;, Latin for &#x27;a small piece of flesh&#x27;. Both Shaw and Latham assigned the red wattlebird to the genus &quot;Merops&quot;. The species was moved to &quot;Anthochaera&quot; in 1827 by the naturalists Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield. The generic name derives from the Ancient Greek &quot;anthos&quot; &#x27;flower, bloom&#x27; and &quot;khairō&quot; &#x27;enjoy&#x27;.

Common names include gillbird, gilly warbler, barkingbird, muttonbird, butcherbird, what&#x27;s o clock, and chock. Unlike many species in southwestern Australia, the red wattlebird was given names by the local indigenous people that were onomatopoeic (sounding like the calls they make). Names recorded include &quot;wodjalok&quot;, &quot;durdal&quot;, &quot;doongorok&quot;, and &quot;djoongong&quot; (this last name is also applied to the western wattlebird). In the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, the local Barngarla people knew it as &quot;ngarkarko&quot; or &quot;ngarkabukko&quot;. The local people of Denial Bay in South Australia called it &quot;noggal&quot;, and the Ngarrindjeri people of the Lower Murray region in South Australia knew it as &quot;rungkan&quot;.

There are three recognised subspecies, though there is a zone of intermediate birds across western Victoria and eastern South Australia, bordered by western Port Phillip Bay to the east, Mount Lofty Ranges to the west, and Little and Big Desert national parks to the north. The differences in plumage are not generally prominent enough to be noticeable in the field.

* &quot;A. c. carunculata&quot; (Shaw, 1790) – found in southeast Australia, namely Victoria, eastern New South Wales, and southeastern Queensland. 
* &quot;A. c. clelandi&quot; (Mathews, 1923) – Kangaroo Island (South Australia). Of a similar size to the nominate subspecies, it tends to have darker plumage, a longer bill, and shorter tarsus. 
* &quot;A. c. woodwardi&quot; Mathews, 1912 – southwest and south-central Australia, west of the Mount Lofty Ranges. This subspecies is a little smaller than the nominate subspecies and has shorter wings. Its plumage is similar, though the yellow patch on the belly is more prominent.

Analysis of DNA showed that the closest relative of the red wattlebird is the yellow wattlebird of Tasmania, the pair splitting from the ancestor of the regent honeyeater—their next closest relative. Honeyeaters are related to the Pardalotidae (pardalotes), Acanthizidae (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and Maluridae (Australian fairy-wrens) in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea.

==Description==

The sexes of the red wattlebird are similar in size and plumage, the length of the adult male ranging from and the adult female from . With an average weight of , the red wattlebird is one of the largest nectar-feeding birds in the world, and the second largest species of honeyeater native to Australia, eclipsed only by the yellow wattlebird. The crown, forehead and upper lores (area between the eyes and nostrils) are dark brown, streaked with pale brown at the front of the crown and white at the rear of the crown. The nape (back of the neck) is slightly paler brown, with white streaks. A whitish triangular marking covers the lower lores and anterior ear covert feathers, bordered below by a dark brown stripe from the lower mandible down to the wattle and around to behind the eye. The throat is dark brown streaked with white. The iris of the eye is orange-red to crimson. The distinctive pinkish-red wattles dangle from the lower rear corner of the ear coverts on either side of the neck, and there is a sliver of pink bare skin at the lower border of the white patch on the face. The chest and belly are streaked white, and there is a bright yellow patch towards the tail. The strong legs and feet are pink or pinkish-brown, and the downward-curving bill is black. The average dimensions of the bill are long, wide, and high at its base. The gape is grey-black, while the inside of the mouth is orange. In common with other honeyeaters, the red wattlebird has a long, specialized tongue to extract nectar from flowers. The tongue can extend well beyond the tip of the bill, and is divided at the end to form a brush-like structure with over a hundred bristles that soak up nectar by capillary action.

The red wattlebird begins moulting after the breeding season, starting with the primary flight feathers in November or December, and finishing between the following March and May. The feathers of the breast, back, median and lesser covert feathers are moulted before those of the crown, remiges, and rectrices.

Immature red wattlebirds are generally less flamboyant. Juveniles have much less prominent wattles, brown irises, a pale crown, and much less yellow on the belly. They moult into first immature plumage within a few months of leaving the nest. First immature birds are more similar to adults overall, having red irises with brown rings, wattles larger but still smaller than adults, and a greyish pink gape.

The red wattlebird is hard to confuse with any other species, though in poor visibility it might be mistaken for the spiny-cheeked honeyeater, or little or western wattlebirds.
===Call===
Red wattlebirds are noisy animals, producing a range of raucous calls. Pairs of birds appear to duet, particularly at food sources, with the male producing a loud cackle and the female a whistling call. The male&#x27;s cackle is loudest between 1 and 3 kHz frequency. A guttural-sounding call, it has been variously described as having a squawking, coughing or hiccuping sound. Males cackle when foraging by themselves, when with other birds, or when declaring their territory to other birds. The whistling call consists of up to five rapid whistles that may or may not ascend in tone, and are repeated 3–4 times. Both sexes commonly utter a single &quot;chock&quot; note that may be harsh and guttural or have 4–5 harmonics. This is thought to be a contact call. These calls all carry over long distances.

Red wattlebirds utter two types of alarm calls, alternating between them while mobbing other animals. One is a harsh call over a wide frequency (1.3 to 5.9 kHz) that is louder at lower frequencies. The other is a lower-pitched staccato call with a frequency of 1.1–2.2 kHz. They give a harsh call when trying to distract intruders from the vicinity of the nest or when picked up, often trying to flap or peck the handler.

==Distribution and habitat==

The red wattlebird is found in southeast Queensland, where it occurs south of Noosa and Cooloola, becoming more common south of Brisbane and Toowoomba. Further south into New South Wales it is found most places east of (and including) the Great Dividing Range and stretching west to the southern North-West Plain, Central Western Slopes and eastern Riverina, and is an occasional visitor to points along the Murray River valley. It is found across Victoria, though is uncommon in the northwest of the state. In South Australia, Devonborough Downs Station, Manunda, Wilpena Pound and Nullarbor Station mark the northern limits of its range. There are scattered records from the Nullarbor Plain, but the species is common in Western Australia west of 125 °E and south of 29 °S. The yellow wattlebird replaces it in Tasmania. The red wattlebird has become more common in some localities, such as the Sunraysia district in the 1960s, and Nambucca Heads and Lefevre Peninsula in the 1980s. Breeding numbers have increased in Sydney and Adelaide. The red wattlebird is a rare vagrant to New Zealand, with confirmed records at Matakana in 1865 and Rohutu, Taranaki, in 1885, and a third unconfirmed report from Motupiko in 1938.

The red wattlebird appears to be a permanent resident in much of its range, though its movements are poorly known. It appears to be partly migratory in Western Australia and the north coast of New South Wales. In southeastern New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, it appears to move to lower altitudes for winter. For instance, birds vacate the Brindabella Range over the cooler months. Overall, little pattern is discernible in the species&#x27; movements, though red wattlebirds appear to move to feed on populations of flowering banksias and eucalypts, such as winter-flowering banksias in Perth over the cooler months. Large numbers arrive in time to feed on flowering native apples (&quot;Angophora&quot;) in Mudgee and Cobbora districts in central-western New South Wales, and on white box (&quot;Eucalyptus albens&quot;) at Barrington in central-northern New South Wales. A mainly resident population on the Swan Coastal Plain near Perth is supplemented during winter by more arriving from inland areas. South of Perth, red wattlebirds are more locally nomadic, moving to new patches of blooming wildflowers. East of Perth in areas around Kellerberin, Kwolyin, and Nangeenan, the red wattlebird is present from late autumn to spring, breeding in August and September. Around Lake Grace, the red wattlebird is present year-round.

Open sclerophyll forest and woodland, generally dominated by eucalypts, is the most common habitat of the species. It is more common in forests with ample shrubby or grassy understory. It is less commonly encountered in shrubland, heath, or margins of wet sclerophyll forest. It is rarely found in mature pine plantations. Within urban areas, it is abundant in parks and reserves, gardens and golf courses, as well as orchards and vineyards. It occasionally ventures into subtropical, semi-arid or subalpine regions, and has been found up to above sea level. The red wattlebird is rarer in forests that have been affected by dieback (infection by the pathogen &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot;).

==Behaviour==
A loud and active bird, the red wattlebird is found in pairs, in a small family group, or alone during the breeding season, and gathers in larger groups of up to several hundred birds over winter. It flies straight or with a slightly undulating pattern, alternating between gliding and flapping its wings with quick shallow beats, at or slightly above the level of the tree canopy. The red wattlebird moves on the ground by hopping, cocking its tail upwards slightly.

Aggressive and territorial, the red wattlebird defends its nest and sources of food against other birds. It either calls at, snaps at the tails of, or flies at other birds, sometimes scuffling with members of the same species or other large honeyeaters in the air. &quot;Displacement&quot; is a dominant display in which a red wattlebird will land on a perch that has been immediately vacated by another bird. A smaller red wattlebird adopts a horizontal &quot;appeasement posture&quot; side-on to the aggressor in which it lowers its head, flutters its wings and edges closer to the other bird. 
As well as smaller bird species, red wattlebirds can mob and chase larger species, such as the Australian magpie (&quot;Gymnorhina tibicen&quot;), butcherbirds, currawongs, the black-faced cuckooshrike (&quot;Coracina novaehollandiae&quot;), the olive-backed oriole (&quot;Oriolus sagittatus&quot;), crows, ravens, the laughing kookaburra (&quot;Dacelo novaeguineae&quot;), and even small raptors like the collared sparrowhawk (&quot;Accipiter cirrocephalus&quot;).

===Breeding===

The red wattlebird breeds throughout its range, with nesting taking place between July and December, though occasionally outside these months, if conditions are favourable. One or two broods are laid each year.

Red wattlebirds generally nest as solitary pairs. The nest is a cup-shaped structure formed from sticks and leaves, lined with bark, grass, and hair, between above ground, usually in the forked branches of a tree—generally a eucalypt. The nest is usually located centrally rather than on the periphery of a tree. A study in Eastwood State Forest, near Armidale in New South Wales, found that red wattlebirds preferred to nest in manna gum (&quot;Eucalyptus viminalis&quot;) and apple box (&quot;E. bridgesiana&quot;).

A clutch of two or three pale brown- and lavender-spotted pinkish eggs are normally laid. They measure , and are a tapered oval in shape. The eggs are normally incubated by both parents, but sometimes just by the female. They hatch after 16–21 days. The chicks are born almost naked, with a small amount of grey down on their head and body. They are mostly brooded by the female, but sometimes the male will also brood. The nestlings are fed by both parents, and occasionally immature birds will contribute. Their eyes open at around 7 days. They fledge 15–20 days after hatching, and both parents continue to feed them for a further 2–3 weeks. Young are given manna (crystallised plant sap) and insects, such as beetles, bugs, and flies.

===Feeding===
The red wattlebird is predominantly a nectar-feeder, foraging mostly in trees; in particular, climbing along branches (rather than the trunk) and probing flower-heads with its bill. One study in Bondi State Forest in southern New South Wales revealed that the species foraged at a height of . They seldom look for food on the ground, though do so to feed on shrubs such as the cats paw (&quot;Anigozanthos humilis&quot;). The red wattlebird prioritises visiting flowers that produce a lot of nectar, such as those of eucalypts, banksias, grasstrees (&quot;Xanthorrhoea&quot;), and emu bushes (&quot;Eremophila&quot;). It often prefers plants with easy access to nectar, rather than those with tubular flowers (and thus difficult-to-access nectar). The red wattlebird seeks out yellow flower-heads of holly-leaved banksia (&quot;Banksia ilicifolia&quot;), which have much higher nectar content than the more mature red flower-heads. The species forages much more often in native than exotic plants, though the introduced coral tree (&quot;Erythrina&quot;) is popular. In addition to nectar, it takes insects and other small creatures, usually by hawking, and it also feeds on berries and other fruit. A field study in the Mount Lofty Ranges found that it spent twice as much time feeding on nectar compared to insects.

One field study found that red wattlebirds foraged for longer periods when nectar concentrations in flowers were low, and consumed fewer insects at this time. However, this could have been because the temperature was lower and hence insects were less active. In Gingin, Western Australia, 97% of red wattlebirds at a site of two mixed kangaroo paw species were observed feeding on a single species at its peak flowering: cats paw in August and red-and-green kangaroo paw (&quot;A. manglesii&quot;) in September, with very few visits to the other species or hybrids.

In central New South Wales, the red wattlebird forages more often on the foliage of the grey gum (&quot;Eucalyptus punctata&quot;) over other trees, though it does also show some preference for narrow-leaved ironbark (&quot;E. crebra&quot;), if grey gum is not present. Red wattlebirds tend to oust noisy friarbirds (&quot;Philemon corniculatus&quot;) where both species are present. The red wattlebird often forages alongside the New Holland honeyeater (&quot;Phylidonyris novaehollandiae&quot;), little friarbird (&quot;P. citreogularis&quot;), western and little wattlebirds, rainbow lorikeet (&quot;Trichoglossus moluccanus&quot;), purple-crowned lorikeet (&quot;Glossopsitta porphyrocephala&quot;), satin bowerbird (&quot;Ptilonorhynchus violaceus&quot;), pied currawong (&quot;Strepera graculina&quot;), and crimson rosella (&quot;Platycercus elegans&quot;), though they generally chase other nectar-feeding birds away from a horde of eucalypt flowers.

A field study, conducted in winter 1978 on Kangaroo Island, found red wattlebirds to be territorial around a rich source of nectar, namely a large cup gum (&quot;Eucalyptus cosmophylla&quot;), driving off smaller honeyeaters. This indicated that the species would exclude other species, if food was scarce. In New England National Park, red wattlebirds would be more aggressive when there were moderate amounts of nectar in groves of flowering banksias, but were less so at lean or abundant times.

The red wattlebird has a brush-tipped tongue, with a long segment bearing around 120 individual bristles. It feeds by placing the bill in a flower and inserting the tongue into its nectar chamber, drawing the nectar up by capillary action. The bristles increase the surface area of the tongue available for the uptake of nectar.

==Predators and parasites==
The nests of red wattlebirds are often parasitized by the pallid cuckoo (&quot;Cacomantis pallidus&quot;), and less commonly by the Pacific koel (&quot;Eudynamys orientalis&quot;). Nest predators include the brown goshawk (&quot;Accipiter fasciatus&quot;), black falcon (&quot;Falco subniger&quot;), pied currawong (&quot;Strepera graculina&quot;), Australian raven (&quot;Corvus coronoides&quot;), common brushtail possum (&quot;Trichosurus vulpecula&quot;), domestic cat, and snakes.

&quot;Isospora anthochaerae&quot; is an Apicomplexan parasite that has been isolated from the red wattlebird in Western Australia, from oocytes collected from faecal samples. Species of bird louse that have been recorded on the red wattlebird include &quot;Menacanthus&quot; eurysternus, and members of the genera &quot;Brueelia&quot;, &quot;Myrsidea&quot; and &quot;Philopterus&quot;.

==Interactions with people==
Red wattlebirds are adversely impacted by land and undergrowth clearing, and have vanished from some habitats thus altered. Despite this, they are classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, as they occur over a wide range, have a large population, and the population decline is not rapid. Red wattlebirds are regularly killed by cats and dogs, as well as being hit by cars on roads. In 1924 in northern Victoria, the red wattlebird was described as very wary, on account of being highly regarded (and shot) for its meat. Indeed, it was shot widely for food or sport, or because it was held to be a pest of vineyards or orchards. On occasion, red wattlebirds have raided vineyards and orchards for grapes, stone fruit, figs, olives, loquats, apples, pears, and berries, which they puncture and extract the juice or flesh from.

The red wattlebird has been kept as an aviary bird in Sydney. It is not difficult to look after, but can be very aggressive to other cage birds. &quot;Grevillea&quot; &#x27;Robyn Gordon&#x27; is a useful companion shrub as it bears flowers all year round.

<text>&quot;E depois do adeus&quot; () is a song recorded by Portuguese singer Paulo de Carvalho, with music composed by José Calvário and lyrics by José Niza. It in the Eurovision Song Contest 1974, held in Brighton, having previously won &#x27;s Grande Prémio TV da Canção Portuguesa.

The song&#x27;s airing on 24 April 1974 at 10:55 p.m. on Emissores Associados de Lisboa Radio Station was one of the two secret signals which alerted the rebel captains and soldiers to begin the Carnation Revolution.

== Background ==
=== Conception ===
&quot;E depois do adeus&quot; was composed by José Calvário with lyrics by José Niza, and recorded by Paulo de Carvalho. The song is a ballad, with him taking the role of a man who is faced with the end of a relationship. He tells his lover how he feels, likening her to &quot;a flower that I picked&quot;, implying that the relationship was of a comparatively short duration. He also comments on the nature of love itself, singing that it is &quot;winning and losing&quot;.

De Carvalho also recorded an English-language version of the song titled &quot;(And then) After love&quot;.

=== Eurovision ===
On 7 March 1974, &quot;E depois do adeus&quot; performed by de Carvalho competed in the of the Grande Prémio TV da Canção Portuguesa. It received 245 points, winning the competition. As the festival was used by Radiotelevisão Portuguesa (RTP) to select their song and performer for the of the Eurovision Song Contest, the song became the , and de Carvalho the performer, for Eurovision.

On 6 April 1974, the Eurovision Song Contest was held at The Dome in Brighton hosted by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and broadcast live throughout the continent. De Carvalho performed &quot;E depois do adeus&quot; sixteenth on the night, following &#x27;s &quot;Mein Ruf nach dir&quot; by Piera Martell and preceding &#x27;s &quot;Sì&quot; by Gigliola Cinquetti. José Calvário conducted the live orchestra in the performance of the Portuguese entry.

At the close of voting, it had received 3 points, placing fourteenth –tying for last with Switzerland, , and – in a field of 17. It was succeeded as Portuguese entry at the by &quot;Madrugada&quot; by Duarte Mendes.

== Carnation revolution ==
Despite the modest placing in Eurovision, the song achieved considerable fame as one of the two signals to launch the Carnation Revolution in Portugal against the Estado Novo regime under Américo Tomás and Marcello Caetano – the other being the folk song &quot;Grândola, Vila Morena&quot; by Zeca Afonso, which was the signal for the coup leaders to announce that they had taken control of strategic parts of the country. &quot;E depois do adeus&quot; was broadcast at 22.55 on 24 April 1974 by Emissores Associados de Lisboa.

Histories of the contest tend to take a facetious view of this fact. In his &quot;The Eurovision Song Contest: The Official History&quot;, author John Kennedy O&#x27;Connor, for example, describes it as &quot;the only Eurovision entry to have actually started a revolution&quot;, while Des Mangan suggests that other Portuguese entries (he mentions &#x27;s &quot;Se eu te pudesse abraçar&quot;) would not be likely to inspire coups.

<text>The Nooksack River is a river in western Whatcom County of the northwestern U.S. state of Washington, draining extensive valley systems within the North Cascades around Mount Shuksan, Mount Baker and the Twin Sisters, and a portion of Fraser Lowland south of the Canada–United States border.

The river &quot;proper&quot; begins with the merging of three main tributaries, namely the North Fork, Middle Fork and South Fork, near Deming. All three forks originate in the Mount Baker Wilderness, and the North Fork, the longest of the three, is sometimes considered the main river. The Nooksack is approximately in total length measuring from the North Fork headwaters. The lower Nooksack flows as a northerly loop through the fertile southern Fraser Lowland agricultural area before emptying into Bellingham Bay and, via the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Strait of Georgia, communicating with the Pacific Ocean.

==Course==
===North Fork===

The North Fork Nooksack River rises at the Nooksack Cirque east of Mount Shuksan within the western part of North Cascades National Park in central Whatcom County. Gathering meltwater off East Nooksack Glacier, it flows generally west past north of Mount Baker. For most of its course, this fork is paralleled by State Route 542 (also called the Mount Baker Highway). The river picks up large creeks such as Price Creek, a short creek draining Price Lake; as well as Ruth Creek, before the uppermost highway bridge crosses it.

At Nooksack Falls, the river flows through a narrow valley and drops freely into a deep rocky river canyon. The falls are viewable from the forested cover near the cliff edge. A small parking lot nearby contains a kiosk with information about the falls and a hydroelectric project.

Continuing west, the North Fork receives several tributaries including Wells Creek, which joins the river at the base of the falls, and Glacier Creek and Canyon Creek, before the river turns briefly south. The Middle Fork and South Fork join the North Fork within a few miles of one another. The Middle Fork joins first, with its confluence opposite Welcome. The South Fork joins just southeast of Deming and the Nooksack Indian Reservation, creating the Nooksack River &quot;proper&quot;.

The traditional name of the North Fork in the Nooksack language is &quot;Chuw7álich&quot; (&quot;the next point&quot;).

===Middle Fork===
The Middle Fork Nooksack River, about long, originates on the southern slopes of Mount Baker near Baker Pass. It flows generally northwest between Mount Baker and Twin Sisters, and drains into the North Fork opposite Welcome, about northeast of the confluence between the North and South Forks.

The traditional name of the Middle Fork in the Nooksack language is &quot;Nuxwt’íqw’em&quot; (&quot;always-murky water&quot;).

===South Fork===
The South Fork Nooksack River, about long, rises in southern Whatcom County, east of Twin Sisters Mountain near Bell Pass and Lake Wiseman. It flows briefly south, entering Skagit County, then northwest to re-enter Whatcom County. It flows past the town of Acme, and due north until merging with the North Fork near the State Route 9 bridge, southeast of Deming and the Nooksack Indian Reservation.

The traditional name of the South Fork in the Nooksack language is &quot;Nuxw7íyem&quot; (&quot;always-clear water&quot;).

===Nooksack &quot;proper&quot;===
After the Middle and South Forks join, the combined river flows northwest, emerging from the valley south of the Sumas Mountain and flowing past Everson and Lynden. Near Everson, the river is at risk of floods breaching the right bank, allowing flow into lower lands to the north, through Sumas River and into Canada. At Lynden the river turns southwest and, near Ferndale, south. Its mouth is at the north side of Bellingham Bay at the Lummi Indian Reservation, approximately west of Bellingham.

==River modifications==
The river supplies the nearby town of Glacier, Washington with hydroelectric power from a dam on the North Fork near Nooksack Falls. The Middle Fork was partially blocked with a diversion dam built by the City of Bellingham in the late 1950s for diverting water into Lake Whatcom, which supplies the city&#x27;s drinking water. As of July 2020, this old water diversion system has been modified to remove the dam and restore the river channel for the benefit of critical salmon spawning habitat.

In the late 19th century, most of the stream flow of the Nooksack River near its mouth flowed through the present channel of the short Lummi River to Lummi Bay, northwest of Bellingham Bay. Near the start of the 20th century, a log jam plugged the channel to Lummi Bay, forcing the river to change its channel to the present one. The accumulation of the new river delta has been an ongoing field of research regarding the new wetlands it has created. The river only resupplies the previous delta on Lummi Bay during high-flow conditions.

==Floods==

The river is subject to flooding due to high rainfall amounts in the region and some of the deepest snow packs in the country. The Pineapple Express, a weather pattern that brings central Pacific wind and rain to the northwest, can sometimes catalyze flooding. For example, flooding in Everson occurred 14 times from to 1936 to 2003.
Specific examples of floods are:

* In November 1990, flooding caused over $20 million in damage and the closure of the Trans-Canada Highway for 26 hours. 
* In November 1995, flooding caused $4 million in damage in Whatcom County.
* During a November 2006 storm, the river flooded the city of Everson. 
* In November and December 2021, water from the Nooksack River filled the Sumas Prairie in Canada&#x27;s Fraser Valley. This resulted in evacuations because of a landslide, $1 billion in damage in Abbotsford, British Columbia, and further damage elsewhere.

Both the USA and Canada have faced long-term political hurdles to adequate flood prevention. &quot;On the Washington side, there has been a reluctance to spend money to benefit Canada&quot;, and on the Canadian side, &quot;B.C. has been reluctant to use the International Joint Commission following a 1988 report that resulted in the cancellation of the Sage Creek coal mine on the Flathead River&quot;.

<doc id="731669" wikidata="Q6700918" url="?curid=731669" title="Luis Muñoz Rivera Park">
<text>The Luis Muñoz Rivera Park (or Parque Luis Muñoz Rivera in Spanish) is a 27.2 acre (110,000 m2) recreational public space located in Puerta de Tierra in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The park was named in honor of Puerto Rican statesman Luis Muñoz Rivera. It is the largest public square in the San Juan metropolitan area.

==History==
In 1917 Law 43 was passed stating a park named Muñoz Rivera Park should be built in San Juan and land was set aside for its creation. The land once formed part of the city&#x27;s &quot;Third line of defense&quot; built in the 18th century. The powder magazine built in 1769, “El Polvorín de San Gerónimo”, designed by military engineer Thomas O&#x27;Daly, is still located on the grounds of the park.

The east side of the park is bordered by the Puerto Rican Supreme Court building designed in 1952-56 by architects Toro Ferrer. To the north lies the public beach called El Escambrón Beach, the Parque del Tercer Milenio and the Estadio Sixto Escobar, former home of the San Juan Senators and Santurce Crabbers baseball clubs.

The park was designed by Bennett, Parsons &amp; Frost of Chicago in 1925. Its construction from 1926 to 1934 was directed by William Parsons and Francisco Valines Cofresí. The distinctive &quot;faux bois&quot; park elements and furniture were designed by sculptor Victor M. Cott in the 1930s. Subsequent major restorations have been directed by architects Orval Sifontes in the 1970s, Otto Reyes Casanova in 1990–93, and by Andres Mignucci, in 2000–04, who also wrote about the park&#x27;s history in his book .

In 2015, then mayor of San Juan Carmen Yulín Cruz announced the park would be used for educational purposes. In late December 2018, the park was the venue for a large fashion show raising awareness for the HIV pandemic.

<doc id="731670" wikidata="Q1282412" url="?curid=731670" title="Mazda Luce">
<text>The is an executive car that was produced by Mazda in Japan from 1966 until 1991. It was widely exported as the Mazda 929 from 1973 to 1991 as Mazda&#x27;s largest sedan. Later generations were installed with luxury items and interiors as the Luce became the flagship offering. The Luce was replaced by the Sentia in 1991 which was also exported under the 929 nameplate. 

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;&quot; was taken from the Italian word for &quot;light&quot;.
== SU/SV series (1966–1973) ==


Following an agreement signed with Bertone in April 1962, the 1965 Luce 1500 show car was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro of Italy. It was low and sharp, looking more like a contemporary BMW Bavaria than its smaller Mazda companion models, the Familia and the &quot;kei car&quot; Carol.

The production version (SUA), started production in July 1966 and launched in August, had a higher roofline but retained the BMW-esque look. It was a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive four-door sedan, and featured a square 1490 cc &quot;1500&quot; SOHC engine, producing at 5500 rpm and . It sold poorly at . The &quot;1500 SS&quot; version with twin carburettors was introduced in June 1967, producing at 5500 rpm and at 5500 rpm. A stroked 1.8-liter (1796 cc) &quot;1800&quot; engine was added in December 1968. This new model, the Luce 1800, produced at 5500 rpm and at 2500 rpm. To accommodate the taller 1800 engine the bonnet on this model has a slight bump in the middle with an air inlet on the leading edge.

An &quot;estate&quot; (station wagon) was also added in April 1967, with the same engine as the sedan (SUAV). Unlike most commercial vehicles at the time, it was also available with a three-speed automatic transmission.

=== 1500/1800 ===
The Luce Mark I was sold in Australia and most other export markets under the names &quot;Mazda 1500&quot; and &quot;Mazda 1800&quot;. Mazda considered assembling the Luce in South Africa and brought in 50 examples for evaluation and company use in 1967, but they instead chose to focus on the 1200 (Familia) and compact pickup trucks.

The Mazda brand entered the United States market in 1970 with just the small R100, but expanded to a full line in 1971. This included all three of the company&#x27;s piston-powered models, the compact 1200, mid-size 616, and full-size 1800.

The US-market 1800 produced and and cost . Performance with the three-speed automatic transmission was sluggish, with a time of 17.5 seconds and a 20.5 seconds and quarter-mile. Unlike the rotary cars, the 1800 was a flop. &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine said it was solid to the point of being overly heavy, with pleasant handling but poor performance. It was gone from the market for 1972.

Opposite to what happened in the US, in Europe the 1800 was considered as having a better performance with at 5500 rpm (SAE) and maximum torque of at 3000 rpm (SAE), for a time of 13.4 seconds. The poor performance of this engine in USA was probably due to fact that in USA, the gasoline had an octane index of only 85 RON, while in Europe, the gasoline at the time had an octane index of 95 RON (up to 100 RON today). Also the manual transmission with four gears used in Europe contributed to a much better performance than the three-speed automatic transmission usually used in the US. The 1800 (fitted with a manual transmission) also sold in small numbers in Australia.

The number of Mazda 1800 automobiles imported into the US are as follows.
* 1970 – 1,058 sedans, 937 wagons
* 1971 – 1,020 sedans, 1,639 wagons
* 1972 – 100 sedans, 0 wagons

The 1800 four-door sedan (model SVA) was produced from October 1968 through March 1973 where a reported 39,401 units were made. An 1800 station wagon version (model SVAV) was added in 1968, lasting until 1970.

=== R130 ===
A rotary-powered Luce appeared in 1969. The Luce R130 was produced from October 1969 to 1972. It used a 1.3-liter 13A engine, which produced and . Quarter-mile (400 meters) performance was 16.9 seconds. This model was styled by Giorgetto Giugiaro, then working for Bertone, as a front-wheel-drive two-door coupé with front disc brakes, which was similar to the NSU Ro 80. This model, Mazda&#x27;s only front-wheel-drive rotary, is now a collector&#x27;s item and very rare. Less than 1,000 were built.
== LA2/LA3 series (1972–1977) ==
Mazda released a second generation LA2 series Luce in November 1972—a rotary powered model that would be later exported as the Mazda RX-4. The conventionally-engined Luce sedan (LA2VS) would not arrive to the Japanese market until April 1973, after starting production in March. It was available as a hardtop (coupé), &quot;formal sedan&quot;, &quot;custom sedan&quot;, and as a station wagon which was also sold as a van in the domestic Japanese market. The original hardtop coupé received a longer, more aggressive front design, which was also installed on the custom sedan. The formal sedan and the van/wagon received a somewhat shorter front end which was also used on the export versions (929). For the facelifted LA3 model from 1976, only one front design was used—one with a more square design.

While the Luce was a large, luxuriously equipped sedan, it still complied to Japanese Government dimension regulations, and it wasn&#x27;t the largest sedan Mazda sold in Japan. That honor went to the short-lived Mazda Roadpacer, which was based on GM Australia&#x27;s Holden Premier.

The LA2VV station wagon entered production in September 1973. The wagon lasted until 1979, until being replaced by the LA4 wagon.

Two rotary engines were offered, the regular 12A and low-emission &quot;AP&quot; 13B. There were also piston models available, and van models for the Japanese market.

Engines:
* 1973–1979 1.8 L (1769 cc) &quot;1800&quot; I4, 2-barrel, 83 hp (61 kW)/101 lb·ft (137 N·m) (export), (1973 LA2VV van and 1975 LA2V Van, Japan)
* 1974–1977 &quot;13B&quot; (1308 cc), 127 hp (93 kW)/138 lb·ft (188 N·m)

=== RX-4 ===

In most export markets, the Japanese Luce Rotary sold as the Mazda RX-4. It was a larger car than its rotary-powered contemporaries, the Capella-based RX-2 and Grand Familia-based RX-3. It used the Luce chassis, replacing the R130 in October 1972, and was produced through October 1977. Its predecessor (the R130) and replacement (the rotary Luce Legato) were not sold in the United States. Mazda marketed the RX-4 as being sporty and luxurious &quot;personal luxury car&quot; with the RX-4 having the best of both worlds. This gave Mazda a well needed boost in the popularity of the Wankel engine unique to Mazda. In Japan, the rotary-engined variants offered an advantage with regards to the annual road tax bill in that Japanese drivers paid less than the in-line engine equivalents, while receiving more performance from the rotary engine.

The RX-4 was initially available as a hardtop coupé and sedan, with a station wagon launched in 1973 to replace the Savanna Wagon. Under the hood at first was a &quot;12A&quot; engine, with the higher-powered version reserved for the five-speed GR-II and GS-II models. The extra power was due to a different exhaust and adjusted ignition timing. The emissions scrubbed &quot;AP&quot; models had five horsepower less, although after June 1973 they received the same power as the regular versions. This was complemented and then replaced by the larger &quot;13B&quot; in December 1973 producing . This model has , for export. This engine was Mazda&#x27;s new &quot;AP&quot; (for &quot;anti-pollution&quot;) version, with much-improved emissions and fuel economy, but somewhat worse cold-starting behavior. In South Africa it was produced until 1979, all years only with the AP engine.

The car used a strut-type independent suspension in front with a live axle in the rear. Brakes were discs in front and drums in the rear. Curb weight was low at and the wheelbase fairly short at . The body was freshened in 1976.

;United States
For the United States market, the RX-4 was sold from 1974 through 1978, when the RX-7 debuted. The 13B produced and in United States emissions form. Base pricing was $4295, with the automatic transmission ($270) and air conditioning ($395) the only expensive options. All three bodystyles were on offer in the United States.

&quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine was impressed, noting the car&#x27;s improved fuel economy and price compared to the RX-3. This was notable, as the Wankel engine had suffered by the mid 1970s with a reputation as a gas-guzzler. Performance was good in a 1974 comparison test of six wagons, with an 11.7 s sprint to and an 18 s/77.5 mph quarter-mile. The magazine noted that the wagon&#x27;s brakes suffered from the extra weight compared to the coupé.

The RX-4 was on &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list for &quot;Best Sports Sedan, $3500–6500&quot; in 1975.

=== 929 ===

The first Mazda 929 was introduced in 1973, as an export name for the piston-engined second generation Mazda Luce. The first generation Luce had been called the &quot;Mazda 1500&quot; or &quot;Mazda 1800&quot; in export markets, but as engines of different displacement were beginning to be used across lines, such a naming philosophy would have soon become confusing. The 929/Luce was a large (for Japan) coupé, sedan, and station wagon powered by a 1769 cc Mazda VB engine. Output was and .

The Luce/929 was updated in 1975 with an optional 1970 cc engine which produced and from a two-barrel carburetor.

== LA4 series (1977–1981) ==
The Luce Legato (introduced as the &quot;LA4&quot; series in October 1977) was a large and luxurious sedan, still powered by Mazda&#x27;s piston or rotary engines. It was also available as a four-door pillarless hardtop that looked like a huge, square coupé, and a wagon, which had more of a utilitarian role than the sedans. The coupé was replaced by the Mazda Cosmo (CD). Production of the Luce 1800 (LA4VS) and 2000 (LA4MS) sedans started in October 1977, ending in July (LA4VS) and September 1981 (LA4MS) for the Japanese market. Of the rotary-engined Luce sedans, the LA42S with the &quot;12A&quot; engine was manufactured between September 1977 and April 1978, while the larger LA43S with the &quot;13B&quot; introduced at the same time lasted until October 1981.
This generation sedan was not sold in North America. It was originally designated as the Luce Legato, but the Japanese automobile industry authorities would not allow for what they considered a name change and so it was officially sold as simply the Luce. The &quot;L&quot; for &quot;Legato&quot; suffix hung on though, with export models receiving the new car as the &quot;929L&quot;. Legato is a musical term meaning &quot;to make a smooth transition from one note to another&quot;

The rebodied Mazda Luce Legato became the second generation 929 in 1978 for export markets, often called the 929L. There was no coupé version developed of this generation, although a four-door hardtop body was available in Japan and some other markets including France. A station wagon was added in February 1979. The design was American-inspired, with stacked rectangular headlights and a large chrome grille. The rather heavy and old-fashioned exterior was made to look even older by having a very up-to-date interior and dashboard. In Europe, a more efficient 2.0-liter inline-four, producing with a single-barrel carb replaced the existing engines.
First presented in Japan in October 1979 was a facelifted LA4 version with large, rectangular headlights and a more orthodox and European front appearance. The final addition was a 2.2-liter diesel engine produced between August 1980 and July 1981 for the sedan (LA4SS) from November 1981 for the wagon (LA4SV). Its output was and . In October 1980, a fuel injected version of the 2-liter engine was also introduced for the Japanese market; it was only available with the hardtop bodywork and full equipment. The 929 was replaced after November 1981 by the next generation Luce/929, although the second generation station wagon continued in production until March 1988 as no wagon replacement of subsequent generations was ever developed. At the time of the generational change, the diesel engine was also installed in the van (wagon) model, only available with the GL equipment level.

Aside from the regular piston-engined variants, the 12A or 13B rotary engines were on offer. The piston-engined variants were exported as the Mazda 929. A rotary-engined version was exported to &quot;general issue&quot; countries and sold as an RX-9. Most RX-9s were sold with the smaller 12A engine.

== HB series (1981–1986) ==

The next generation of Luce was built on the HB platform. Production started in October 1981. Exports again occurred as the 929. Japanese customers could purchase the Luce or the rebadged Mazda Cosmo sold at an exclusive dealership called &quot;Mazda Auto Store&quot;. Later in 1991, Mazda Auto locations were renamed Eunos. Unlike the Luce, the Cosmo was also sold as a coupé, also exported as the 929 coupé. The Luce and Cosmo both offered rotary, gasoline-powered piston-engines, and also a 2.2-liter diesel engine. An LPG-powered 2.0-liter version of the Luce sedan was also built for the Japanese market until December 1995 for taxi and other fleet usage. This generation Mazda Luce was known as the Haima HMC6470L in China and was produced from 1992 to 2002. A 2.0 or 2.2 liter engine was available paired to a 5 speed manual gearbox.

It was a large front-engine rear-wheel drive sedan or hardtop sedan. The Luce was built on the new HB platform, which was now shared with the Cosmo. This version was introduced as the 929 in 1982 in most export markets and produced until 1986. Luces and Cosmos received several differing front end treatments, with export 929s receiving the very staidest front end designs for 929 sedans and the sportiest flip-up headlight &quot;Cosmo&quot; design for 929 coupés. No station wagon variant was issued on the HB platform; the previous LA4 remained in production as a wagon with a new front end (it was essentially the same as the LA4 from the A-pillar backwards).

This generation vehicle was not sold in North America. In some European markets the 929 was badged 2000 sedan or 2000E estate (applied to a facelifted version of the previous generation). The turbo version was never offered in Europe, and neither was the four-door hardtop, although parts of Europe bordering on Eastern Europe and the Middle East did receive it.

== HC series (1986–1991) ==

The 1986 Luce was large and luxurious on the HC platform, now with the 13B turbo engine as one of many engine options. It was still exported as the 929, and differed from the (continued) Cosmo. At its introduction in 1986, it was offered with Mazda&#x27;s first V6 engine, called the Mazda J engine which came as a 2.0-liter, a 2.0-liter turbo, and a 3.0-liter for top level model

The Luce Royal Classic (and lesser-spec Limited) was more expensive than its 929 counterpart, featuring greater technical innovation—both were pillarless hardtops. The Royal Classic was factory fitted with a turbocharged 13B Rotary or 2.0-liter V6 engines, electric leather seats, digital speedometer, a cool-box for canned beverages, prominent emblems, electronically adjustable suspension and power options throughout. In order to satisfy Japanese regulations concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement, this generation vehicle was built in two versions; the 3.0-liter V6 was installed in the longer and wider hardtop bodystyle, and the smaller engines, including the rotary engine, were installed in the shorter and narrower sedan bodystyle. Japanese owners who chose the rotary engine received financial benefits in a lower annual road tax bill over trim packages with the larger V6 engine. It was the larger model that carried over to the next platform that introduced the Mazda Sentia.

1991 was the last year of the Luce nameplate. The Eunos Cosmo was already on sale (JC), and the HD platform spawned the Mazda Sentia (now exported as the 929), and the Efini MS-9, making 1991 the last year for a four-door rotary powered sedan prior to the RX-8. In the 1990s Mazda sold the body stampings to Kia Motors who produced the HC series as Kia Potentia between 1992 and 2001—selling it only in South Korea.

The export market 929 was also updated in 1986 (1987 in some markets) with the HC platform and a 3.0-liter V6 engine. The car was produced through 1991, again lagging behind its Japan-market twin, the Mazda Luce, by one year. The 929 began U.S. and Canadian sales in 1987; although predominantly available as a 3.0-liter V6, there were a rare few that made it to the North American market as a four-cylinder 2.2-liter F2 in a RWD configuration. This generation vehicle was sold in North America in sedan bodystyle only beginning with the 1988 model year; the hardtop was not available, nor were the rotary engines. Actor James Garner was used as a spokesman introducing the 929 to North America.

The HC platform came out in two variations during its five-year span that had identical engines and interior but with two distinct body shapes; a pillared four-door sedan as well as a slightly larger pillarless four-door hardtop. While the pillared model was common in all countries that allowed the importation of the 929 (including the US and Canada), the pillarless model was predominantly seen in the Asian and Australian markets.

The Canadian 929 came with a &quot;Winter Package&quot; option and included heated seats, a higher grade alternator, winter tires and non-recessed windshield wipers. A five-speed manual gearbox was an option, but most North American 929s were two-mode (&#x27;power&#x27; and &#x27;economy&#x27;) electronic four-speed automatics. Top speed was . A 0– time of 9.2 seconds was recorded using the manual gearbox; the automatics were somewhat slower at 10 seconds.

The first 3.0-liter V6 engine seen in the 1986–1989 929 was a Single Overhead Cam type with 18 valves. When Mazda released the higher-spec 929S model for the 1990–1991 period, the engine was upgraded to a Double Overhead Cam type with 24 valves, slightly increasing fuel economy, performance and reliability. Also in the revised edition came the presence of an anti-lock braking system, ventilated rear disc brakes and a few inconspicuous changes to the exterior. The standard 18-valve SOHC remained in the base model 929.

After mainstream production ended in May 1991, the HC remained in production until January 1996 for taxi applications in Japan.

=== Kia Potentia ===
When the HC series Luce was replaced with the Mazda Sentia, it continued to be manufactured in South Korea at Kia Hwasung plant as the Kia Potentia. The Potentia was produced from 1992 until 2002 using the 2.0-liter four-cylinder Mazda FE-DOHC engine— which was the same as used in the first generation Kia Sportage&#x27;s gasoline version — a 2.2-liter four-cylinder, and a 3.0-liter V6. The V6 model was called the President trim level.

In May 1997 the Potentia was given a thorough facelift, with a more bulkier, more aggressive front design and heavier looking taillights. Sold as the &quot;New Potentia,&quot; this facelift was developed by Kia themselves and was not used by Mazda. The upper versions of the Potentia were replaced by the more expensive Kia Enterprise, which was based on the Mazda Sentia and was introduced in 1997 after the Sentia was cancelled. The New Potentia was realigned in the marketplace and was now offered with a narrower range of engines and transmissions. The manual transmission, always a slow seller in South Korea, was discontinued and the engines were limited to a 2.0-liter four and a 2.5-liter V6. There was also an LPG-powered 2-liter four available. The New Potentia was unable to compete with the more modern Hyundai Grandeur and the Samsung SM5 and was partially replaced by the somewhat smaller Kia Optima beginning in 2000; the Potentia remained in production until May 2002.

<text>Jan Theiler alias Pastor Leumund (born 1967) is a German artist, musician and political activist.

In the 1990s, he was an influential curator, performance artist and musician on the underground scene organising large-scale music and performance events at various venues in East-Berlin including the Duncker14, K77, Prater, Kule, Kunsthaus Tacheles and many more.

In 1997, he took part in the Labyrinth festival, in the Torpedo Hallen, Copenhagen. In 1999, he exhibited at the Rich and Famous gallery, London.

He was one of a number of artists including Mark Divo, the Mikry Drei, Lennie Lee and Dan Jones to have squatted the Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich) in the February 2002, in an attempt to revive the Dada movement.

He became well known in Zürich as a spokesman for the neo-dadaists. He curated the second (Sihlpapier 2003), third (Toilethouses 2004) and fourth (Pornokino 2005) Dada festival together with Mark Divo in Zürich.

In 2005, he was included in the Real Biennale at the Kinský Palace, Prague. In 2005, he also attempted to set up a political party known as the Berg Party during the struggle for the Palast der Republik. In 2011, the Party merged with the squatters party, becoming Bergpartei, die ÜberPartei. Jan Theiler remaines chairman of the party.

<doc id="731690" wikidata="Q2963495" url="?curid=731690" title="Buckles (comics)">
<text>Buckles is a comic strip by David Gilbert about the misadventures of an anthropomorphic naïve dog. &quot;Buckles&quot; debuted on March 25, 1996, and ended on March 21, 2021.

According to King Features Syndicate: &quot;More of an only child with canine instincts than he is the family pet. Buckles can display all the charm...of a small child discovering how to find his way through life.&quot;

GoComics began a repeat run of the strip effective May 10, 2021.

== Characters ==

=== Buckles ===
Buckles is a guileless and innocent dog, and is the strip&#x27;s protagonist. He was born on March 25, 1996 (The same day the first strip was published). Most of the storylines of the Buckles comic series involve moral issues within Buckles himself. Of course since he is a puppy, issues are more to the point of whether or not to get in the garbage, roll in the mud, or chew up a valuable piece of clothing. Buckles also fears cats. One of Buckles&#x27; favorite things to chew up seems to be the remote control to the TV, often ending in a strict lecture from Paul (his owner). The other is to attack and kill Paul&#x27;s vacuum cleaners. And of course most of his misadventures end either with praise and a treat or a quick &quot;No! Bad Dog!&quot;/&quot;Buckles, You Bad Dog!&quot;

=== Paul and Jill Haggerson ===
Buckles&#x27; owners who are strict and kind. Paul and Jill love Buckles. When he does something bad, they often scold him and put him in the garage.

Paul, or Jill, often says/yells &quot;BUCKLES, YOU BAD DOG!!!!&quot; (which is their catchphrase) when annoyed with Buckles.

In May 2006, it was revealed Paul previously had a dog named Shadow before he and Jill got married.

=== Christina ===
Jill&#x27;s niece who puts dresses on Buckles and makes him attend her tea parties.

=== Flea ===
An unseen but heard presence who lives behind Buckles&#x27; right ear.

=== Arden ===
A bird whom Buckles often asks for advice. He likes worms, because they&#x27;re for lunch.

Arden occasionally breaks the fourth wall, especially on June 3, 2007.

=== Lester ===
A dog who, because of hip dysplasia, has a sort of wheelchair apparatus providing mobility instead of his hind legs.

=== Rusty ===
A streetwise stray whose freedom Buckles envies.

=== Scrappy ===
An annoying squirrel who lives in the backyard. He hates Buckles and Arden, frequently insulting them and calling them rude names like &quot;slobber face&quot; (Buckles) and &quot;beak brain&quot; (Arden).

There are several stories involving Scrappy in the series. One example is him getting in a fight with a black squirrel. Another occasional story is where Scrappy breaks into Paul and Jill&#x27;s attic and realizes he is lost.

=== Irene ===
The love interest of Buckles&#x27; life that is a fire hydrant.

=== Paperboy ===
A younger newspaper deliverer who often throws rolled-up newspapers at Buckles.

=== Other characters ===
*Charlie: A minor character in the comic series. He is a goose and a rival of Buckles. Charlie refers to him as &quot;mad dog&quot;, and occasionally &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. In some stories, Charlie and the other geese break into Paul&#x27;s house and throw a &quot;party&quot; by destroying the house, but after Paul and Jill get home, they fly off. Paul and Jill are then mad at Buckles because they think he threw a party (Paul doesn&#x27;t even allow parties at his house; he had one as a teenager). Another occasional story is where Charlie and the other geese ruin Paul&#x27;s Corvette and Buckles scares them off by barking at them.
*Sophie and Iris: Female American Eskimo Dog and bloodhound respectively and two of Buckles&#x27; friends who argue over trying to talk to him.
*The black squirrel, Scrappy&#x27;s nemesis.
*Paul&#x27;s parents and brother from the summer vacation strips.
*Jay: A blue bird who is Arden&#x27;s assistant.

== Recurring jokes ==
There is meta-humor in this strip; for example, the characters talk with their mouths closed. Their dialogue has many exclamation points when they talk quietly or nicely like the dialogue in &quot;Peanuts&quot;. Also, in some strips, there are repeated drawings and lines (i.e. in the May 21, 2008 strip, Buckles steps back from a harmless garter snake, horrified. He then hides behind Paul, who rolls his eyes and says, &quot;For crying out loud, Buckles! It&#x27;s just a harmless garter snake!&quot; After that, like Buckles, Paul steps back from the harmless garter snake, horrified. Then he hides behind Jill, who is gardening but rolls her eyes, saying, &quot;For crying out loud, Paul!...&quot; like Paul did with Buckles).

== Books ==

There are three different comic collections published by Plan 9 Publishing:
*&quot;Buckles Unleashed&quot; (2002)
*&quot;There&#x27;s a Street Dog in All of Us!&quot; (2003)
*&quot;A Good Vacuum is a Dead Vacuum!&quot; (2005)

Currently, the books are out of stock. David Gilbert left the publisher and will seek into another printing option for the current and future collections.

<text>Oscar Gonzáles is an author and poet born in Puerto Cortes, Honduras. He has published five books in the areas of literature and the social sciences and has received literary awards from Yale University. Lauded by the Mexican poet and intellectual José Emilio Pacheco as &quot;the rise of a fresh and unique young voice,&quot; Oscar Gonzales studied under Yale&#x27;s eminent literary critics Harold Bloom, Manuel Durán, and Roberto González-Echevarría. He has a combined B.A. in Latin American studies (history, economics and literature) and B.A./M.A. in Latin American literature from Yale University, and in 1991 he became the first undergraduate to win Yale&#x27;s Theron Rockwell Field Prize for his anthology of poems &quot;Donde el plomo flota&quot; (Where Lead Floats). At Yale, he was a member of Skull and Bones. He currently resides in Washington DC with his wife and three children. Durán classifies Gonzales&#x27;s work with that of Nobel Prize winner Pablo Neruda &quot;because of the amplitude of his poetry&#x27;s horizons, the strength and firmness of its voice, and the &#x27;intimist&#x27; and cosmic sensuality of his love poetry. Eroticism and panoramic vision of nature are characteristics that unite the two poets, together with an interest in the themes of liberty and the disdain of oppression, injustice, tyranny.&quot;

==Biography==
Gonzales grew up on the north coast of Honduras in the city of Puerto Cortes, one of the largest harbors in Central America. His father was a union organizer for the transnational banana dockworkers union and was persecuted politically for his activities. Although his parents only completed basic schooling, they invested in their children&#x27;s education. Gonzales attended the Saint John&#x27;s Bilingual School in Puerto Cortes, a grammar school supported by Episcopalian missionaries. At age 14 he was awarded a scholarship to attend the Kent School, a New England Boarding School in Kent, Connecticut. He was accepted to attend Yale University. While attending Yale, Oscar was awarded the Theron Rockwell Field Prize for his 35-page book titled &quot;Donde El Plomo Flota&quot; (&quot;Where Lead Floats&quot;), and became the first undergraduate in Yale history to receive the award. Written in Spanish, the work satirizes social and political realities of his native Honduras and Latin America in general. The committee of judges for the Theron-Rockwell prize &quot;was most impressed with the originality of the work and the powerful poetic voice mastered&quot;. His political writings reflect the immense sense of loss and frustration he feels about his country&#x27;s present economic and political struggles. According to an interview in the Yale Daily News, &quot;through his writing he hopes to lessen the antipathy toward Honduras and awaken a social consciousness&quot;. At Yale Gonzales studied under Yale&#x27;s Harold Bloom, Manuel Durán, and Roberto González-Echevarría.

==Works==

===Poetry===
In the words of Yale Professor Emeritus, Manuel Duran, &quot;Oscar Gonzáles knows how to create an expansive poetry, that opens up to horizons that are more vast each time, without forgetting its roots in the concrete, in the immediate, in detail that is precise and revealing. In a more encompassing perspective and light, we can assert that our poet belongs to the family of Pablo Neruda, because of the amplitude of his poetry&#x27;s horizons, the strength and firmness of its voice, and the &#x27;intimist&#x27; and cosmic sensuality of his love poetry.&quot;

Gonzales&#x27; first book of poems, &quot;Donde el Plomo Flota&quot;, is an extended 35-page poem that intertwines personal stories of the poet&#x27;s childhood and youth with the tense political situation of the 1980s in Honduras, when the Cold War was in full swing. The first section of the book discusses a world of single mothers struggling to feed children in families without father figures who are absent due to the civil war and the dire economic situation. Some of the characters are described as aunts who contemplate suicide as an escape from an oppressive system. The difficult life of the dockworkers of the banana company and their ambiguous relationship with the transnational company that simultaneously provides a living but also a dangerous workplace is treated in several poems. A section of the book discusses Honduran myths such as La Llorona, a crying female ghost who searches for her lost children, as a metaphor for the plight of single mothers without support. A scathing satirical part of the book presents the corrupt world of politicians who use tax money to buy luxury cars in a country with limited financial resources. The last section deals with the issue of the &quot;disappeared&quot;, individuals who have been politically assassinated by the military.

His second book of poetry, &quot;Amada en el Amado Transformada&quot;, provides a wide departure from the political satire of &quot;Plomo&quot;. The poet is now deeply affected by love of his country. Influenced by Saint John of the Cross and his poem &quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot;—to which the title alludes—the book can be interpreted as a mythical and highly symbolic retelling of the &quot;Song of Songs&quot; traditionally attributed to Salomon in the Bible. The beloved can be the motherland, the female incarnation of a spouse or poetry itself.

&quot;Central America in My Heart&quot; is Gonzales&#x27; third book and the first to be published in the United States in a bilingual edition. Lauded by the renowned Mexican poet and intellectual José Emilio Pacheco as &quot;the rise of a fresh and unique young voice&quot; in poetry, the book comprises three distinct parts that vary stylistically and thematically. The first part, divided into poems named for various nations and locations, represents love poems, using location as metaphor and symbol. The second part of the book shifts to a stoic accusatory tone that reveals the poet&#x27;s grief and anger as he is forced to choose a life in exile. The third part explores political themes such as justice and the issue of the disappeared in Latin America.

===International development===
Gonzales has also published several books in the area of international development as advocacy to promote the rights of underserved and under-represented rural populations in Latin America. The books discuss the interactions of agricultural and economic growth in lieu of poverty reduction and environmental protection programs. In &quot;Agricultural Growth, Natural Resource Sustainability and Poverty Alleviation&quot;, Gonzales argues that there are tradeoffs when programs with different objectives are implemented and solutions must incorporate a balance between competing goals. To illustrate these development strategies, three cases of land use intensification are presented: horticultural production in the Guatemalan highlands, coffee production in Honduras, the &quot;farmer to farmer&quot; movement in Nicaragua. These case studies are compared to two cases of land use extensification: depopulation in the north and east of El Salvador as a result of the Civil War and the abandonment of pastures in Costa Rica to illustrate the interactions between policies and de facto actions by the local populations.

&quot;Agricultural growth, natural resource sustainability, and poverty alleviation in Latin America&quot; demonstrates that hillside regions account for a large proportion of the rural poor in Latin America. These populations have been displaced from productive farmlands by intensive agricultural development. Thus, projects that simply focus on agricultural development will not necessarily lead to poverty reduction, but may sometimes increase poverty if displaced rural populations are not taken into account. A wide array of policies, technologies and institutional arrangements are presented to provide solutions to the problem of rural poverty in Latin America.

In &quot;Investigación sobre políticas para el desarrollo sostenible en las laderas mesoamericanas&quot; Gonzales writes that a large share of land in Latin America is characterized by problems of erosion, deforestation, sedimentation and loss of biodiversity. To face these problems, governments, NGOs and international agencies have traditionally recurred to the implementation of soil conservation practices, reforestation and the establishment of protected areas. Meanwhile, notable changes in land use and production practices which do not depend primarily on the implementation of any particular project have gone unnoticed, but have had a favorable and substantial impact over natural resources. If policies had concentrated on establishing the appropriate conditions to stimulate this type of spontaneous change, perhaps policies would have had more success than those which were actually implemented.

<text>George Keith Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith (7 January 1746 – 10 March 1823) was a Royal Navy officer and politician who served in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.

==Career==
===Early service===
George Elphinstone was the fourth son of Charles Elphinstone, 10th Lord Elphinstone, and his wife Lady Clementina Fleming, the daughter and heiress of John Fleming, 6th Earl of Wigtown. Elphinstone was born on 7 January 1746 at Elphinstone Tower, Scotland. Of his three elder brothers, two joined the British Army while the third, William Fullerton Elphinstone, initially served in the Royal Navy before joining the East India Company. Elphinstone followed his third brother into the navy, joining the 100-gun ship of the line on 4 November 1761. He stayed in her only briefly, transferring to the 44-gun frigate , commanded by Captain John Jervis, on 1 January of the following year.

Serving in &quot;Gosport&quot; on the North American Station, Elphinstone saw action in the campaign that culminated in the removal of the French from Newfoundland at the Battle of Signal Hill in September. At the end of the year &quot;Gosport&quot; sailed back to Britain, and in March of the following year Elphinstone left her to join the 32-gun frigate HMS &quot;Juno&quot;. He stayed in &quot;Juno&quot; only briefly, transferring from her to the 20-gun frigate HMS &quot;Lively&quot; after two months. As part of the Mediterranean Fleet, Elphinstone served in &quot;Lively&quot; until January 1765, at which point he went on leave at home. His leave over, Elphinstone was next appointed to serve on the 32-gun frigate HMS &quot;Emerald&quot; in August 1766. In December, however, he obtained permission from his captain to leave &quot;Emerald&quot; in order to join his brother William&#x27;s East India Company ship, &quot;Tryton&quot;, as third mate on a trip to China. The two brothers&#x27; uncle, George Keith, 10th Earl Marischal, lent each £2,000 for the journey, which money allowed them to profit from the expedition. He became lieutenant in 1770, commander in 1772, and post captain in 1775.

===Post-Captain===
During the American Revolutionary War he was employed against the privateers, and with a naval brigade at the occupation of Charleston, South Carolina. In January 1781, when in command of the 50-gun , he captured a Dutch 50-gun ship that had beaten off a British vessel of equal strength a few days before. On 15 September 1782 in the Delaware Bay he led a squadron that captured the French 38 gun frigate &quot;Aigle&quot; during which Captain Latouche Tréville was taken prisoner. After peace was signed he remained on shore for ten years, serving in Parliament as member first for Dunbartonshire, and then for Stirlingshire. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1790.

===Admiral===
When war broke out again in 1793, he was appointed to the 74-gun , in which he took part in the occupation of Toulon by Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood. He particularly distinguished himself by beating a body of the French ashore at the head of a naval brigade of British and Spaniards. He was entrusted with the duty of embarking the fugitives when the town was evacuated. In 1794 he was promoted rear-admiral, and in 1795 he was sent to occupy the Dutch Cape Colony thereby establishing the Cape of Good Hope Station. He had a large share in the capture of the Cape in 1795, and in August 1796 captured a whole Dutch squadron in Saldanha Bay. In the interval he had gone on to India, where his health suffered, and the capture at Saldanha was effected on his way home. When the Nore Mutiny broke out in 1797 he was appointed to the command, and was soon able to restore order. He was equally successful at Plymouth, where the squadron was also in a state of effervescence.

At the close of 1798, he was sent as second in command to St Vincent. It was for a long time a thankless post, for St Vincent was at once half incapacitated by ill-health and very arbitrary, while Horatio Nelson, who considered that Keith&#x27;s appointment was a personal slight to himself, was peevish and insubordinate. In May 1799, he was unable to counter Bruix&#x27; expedition, mainly due to sparring among the British naval commanders. Keith followed the enemy to Brest on their retreat, but was unable to bring them to action.

He returned to the Mediterranean in November as commander-in-chief. He co-operated with the Austrians in the siege of Genoa, which surrendered on 4 June 1800. It was however immediately afterwards lost in consequence of the Battle of Marengo, and the French made their re-entry so rapidly that the admiral had considerable difficulty in getting his ships out of the harbour. The close of 1801 and the beginning of the following year were spent in transporting the army sent to recover Egypt from the French. As the naval force of the enemy was completely driven into port, the British admiral had no opportunity of an action at sea, but his management of the convoy carrying the troops, and of the landing at Aboukir, was greatly admired.

He was made Baron Keith of the United Kingdom, an Irish barony having been conferred on him in 1797. On the renewal of the war in 1803 he was appointed Commander-in-Chief, North Sea (which at the time included Nore Command), which post he held until 1807. In February 1812 he was appointed commander-in-chief in the English Channel, and in 1814 he was raised to a viscountcy. During his last two commands he was engaged first in overseeing the measures taken to meet a threatened invasion, and then in directing the movements of the numerous small squadrons and private ships employed on the coasts of Spain and Portugal, and in protecting trade.

He was at Plymouth when Napoleon surrendered and was brought to England in by Captain Maitland (1777–1839). The decisions of the government of the United Kingdom were expressed through him to the fallen Emperor. Lord Keith refused to be led into disputes, and confined himself to declaring steadily that he had his orders to obey. He was not much impressed by the appearance of his illustrious charge and thought that the airs of Napoleon and his suite were ridiculous. Lord Keith died in 1823 at Tulliallan Castle, near Kincardine-on-Forth, Fife, his property in Scotland, and was buried in the parish church.

==Family life==
He was twice married: in 1787 to Jane Mercer, daughter of Colonel William Mercer of Aldie, and in 1808 to Hester Maria Thrale, daughter of Henry Thrale and Hester Thrale, who is spoken of as &#x27;Queeney&#x27; in Boswell&#x27;s &quot;Life of Johnson&quot; and in Madame d&#x27;Arblay&#x27;s &quot;Diary&quot;. He had a daughter by each marriage, the second being Georgina Augusta Henrietta, but no son. Thus the viscountcy became extinct on his death, but the British and Irish baronies descended to his elder daughter Margaret (1788–1867), who married the Comte de Flahault, only to become extinct on her death.
A portrait of him by Owen is in the Painted Hall in Greenwich and another by George Sanders in the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich.

==Freemasonry==
He was initiated into Scottish Freemasonry in Lodge Holyrood House (St Luke&#x27;s), No. 44, on 16 June 1769.

==In fiction==
Lord Keith and his wife &#x27;Queeney&#x27; appear in several of the novels in Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s Aubrey–Maturin series. He is also mentioned in passing in Robert Brightwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Flashman and the Seawolf&quot;, based loosely on the exploits of Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald (as is, in part, the character of Jack Aubrey).

<text>The Moldy Peaches are an American indie group founded by Adam Green and Kimya Dawson. Leading proponents of the anti-folk scene, the band had been on hiatus since 2004, but in 2023 announced on Twitter that they would be reuniting. The appearance of their song &quot;Anyone Else but You&quot; in the film &quot;Juno&quot; significantly raised their profile; Dawson and Green made a handful of reunion appearances together in December 2007.

==History==

Green and Dawson met at Exile on Main Street Records in Mount Kisco, New York, and began working together. Green put out a 7&quot; EP called &quot;X-Ray Vision&quot; under the name the Moldy Peaches, featuring recordings he made from 1994–96 with Dawson and various other friends, notably Jules Sheridan, a songwriter based in Scotland. Green and Dawson recorded a CDR album in 1998 under the name Moldy Peaches 2000 called &quot;FER THE KIDS&quot; before Dawson moved to Port Townsend, Washington. 

In early 1999, Green joined her there, and more home and live recordings transpired. The band returned to New York City as a four piece later in the year, including Jest Commons, guitar, and Justin Campbell, drums. They became active on the New York City anti-folk scene, playing at the SideWalk Cafe before the band broke up. Dawson and Green both recorded solo albums. The band reformed in August 2000 with Chris Barron of the Spin Doctors on lead guitar, Brian Piltin on bass guitar, and Strictly Beats (Brent Cole) on drums. (The &quot;2000&quot; was dropped from their name around this time). A new 11 song album was recorded, which led to a deal with Rough Trade in the UK. They gained recognition after their initial 7&quot; &#x27;Who&#x27;s Got the Crack&quot; was named &#x27;Single of the Week&#x27; in &quot;NME&quot;. Rough Trade released the album &quot;The Moldy Peaches&quot; in 2001. Released in the U.S. on September 11, 2001, the same day as the September 11 attacks, it contained the song &quot;NYC Is Like a Graveyard&quot;. The band expanded to a six-piece, with guitarists Jack Dishel and Aaron Wilkinson, bass player Steven Mertens, and drummer Strictly Beats, augmenting the original duo of Dawson and Green. They toured internationally with The Strokes with whom they shared record label and management.

Aaron Wilkinson left the band and was replaced by Toby Goodshank. Wilkinson died from an overdose in July 2003. The Strokes dedicated their album &quot;Room on Fire&quot; to his memory.

In 2003, a second album &quot;Moldy Peaches 2000&quot; was released, a double-CD compilation of various scraps and live recordings.

After an extensive U.S. headlining tour in the winter of 2003, the band went into hiatus in early 2004. However, the band reunited in late 2004 for a one-off show to benefit Accidental CDs, Records and Tapes, a hole-in-the-wall record store on Ave A in NYC. That store was an early supporter of the band and helped hook them up with the gig that ultimately got them their record deal. Both central members embarked on solo careers.
On December 2, 2007, Dawson and Green played an impromptu set together at The Smell in Los Angeles to end a show where Dawson was headlining. They changed the lyrics of the song &quot;Who&#x27;s Got The Crack&quot; to &quot;Who&#x27;s Got The Blues&quot;. On December 3, 2007, the Moldy Peaches played at the &quot;Juno&quot; film premiere.

The band was booked to appear on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; on January 14, 2008, but they canceled because of the writer&#x27;s strike. Dawson has said that she is not keen to reform the band at present. However, Dawson and Green did appear together on the NPR radio show &quot;Bryant Park Project&quot; on January 16, 2008. and appeared on television show &quot;The View&quot; on January 21, 2008.

Subsequent to the success of the &quot;Juno&quot; soundtrack, which hit No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on its third week of physical release, the song &quot;Anyone Else but You&quot; was released as a UK single on February 25, 2008.

On November 13, 2011, the Moldy Peaches played a short set at the Knitting Factory in New York.

The Moldy Peaches played three European sets in 2023, in London, Barcelona and Madrid.

On August 10th and 11th, 2023, The Moldy Peaches played two sets at Brooklyn Steel in Brooklyn, NY.

On October 13th, 2024, the Moldy Peaches released an alternate version of &#x27;Anyone Else but You&#x27;.

==Solo projects==
Green released his seventh solo album and accompanying film, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, in 2016 via Fat Possum. His initial band included a 3-piece string section.

Dawson has continued to tour playing small clubs and house parties. Her album &quot;Remember That I Love You&quot; on K Records has been well received. Dawson collaborated with Aesop Rock on the album &quot;Hokey Fright&quot; under the name The Uncluded.

Dishel&#x27;s former outfit Stipplicon having broken up, he formed a new band, Only Son, who have toured with Regina Spektor. Dishel also plays in Spektor&#x27;s band.

Mertens has his own group SpaceCamp and plays in Green&#x27;s backing band.

Cole is in the boyband Candy Boys and has performed with numerous acts including Dufus, Jeffrey Lewis, Only Son, Sandra Bernhard, and Toby Goodshank.

Goodshank plays solo shows and is also in a duo, Double Deuce, with his sister Angela.

<doc id="731712" wikidata="Q1183238" url="?curid=731712" title="Transit of Deimos from Mars">
<text>A transit of Deimos across the Sun as seen from Mars occurs when Deimos passes directly between the Sun and a point on the surface of Mars, obscuring a small part of the Sun&#x27;s disc for an observer on Mars. During a transit, Deimos can be seen from Mars as a small dark spot rapidly moving across the Sun&#x27;s face.

The event could also be referred to as a partial eclipse of the Sun by Deimos. However, since the angular diameter of Deimos is only about 1/10 of the angular diameter of the Sun as seen from Mars, it is more natural to refer to it as a transit. The angular diameter of Deimos is only 2½ times the angular diameter of Venus as seen from Earth during a transit of Venus from Earth.

==Transit==
A transit of Deimos from Mars lasts a maximum of about two minutes, due to its relatively rapid orbital period of about 30.3 hours.

Because they orbit Mars in low-inclination equatorial orbits, the shadows of Phobos or Deimos projected onto the surface of Mars exhibit a seasonal variation in latitude. At any given geographical location on the surface of Mars, there are two intervals in a Martian year when the shadows of Phobos or Deimos are passing through its latitude. During each such interval, no or one transit of Deimos can be seen by observers at that geographical location (compared to about half a dozen transits of Phobos).

The shadow always falls on the &quot;winter hemisphere&quot;, except when it crosses the equator during the March and September equinoxes. Thus transits of Deimos happen during Martian autumn and winter in the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere, roughly symmetrically around the winter solstice. Close to the equator they happen around the March and September equinoxes; farther from the equator they happen closer to the winter solstice.

Because it orbits relatively close to Mars, Deimos cannot be seen north of 82.7°N or south of 82.7°S; such latitudes will obviously not see transits either.

On 4 March 2004, a transit was photographed by Mars Rover &quot;Opportunity&quot;, while on 13 March 2004, a transit was photographed by Mars Rover &quot;Spirit&quot;. In the captions below, the first row shows Earth time UTC and the second row shows Martian local solar time.


The data in the tables below is generated using JPL Horizons. There is some discrepancy of a minute or two with the times reported for the series of images above. This may be due to imprecision in the ephemeris data used by JPL Horizons; also the JPL Horizons data gives local apparent solar time while the times reported above are probably some form of mean solar time (and therefore some of the discrepancy would be due to the Martian equivalent of the equation of time).

Note: the data below is valid for the original landing sites. To the extent that the rovers have moved around on the surface, the parameters of the transits as actually observed may be slightly different.

Near misses are in italics.

March 5, 2024: NASA released images of transits of the moon Deimos, the moon Phobos and the planet Mercury as viewed by the &quot;Perseverance&quot; rover on the planet Mars.

==Observation by InSight==
A transit lightcurve of Deimos was obtained in 2020 using the solar array currents measured by the InSight lander. The light drop was about 0.9% (possibly less than the predicted geometric obstruction of 1% due to light scattering by atmospheric dust outside the shadow). The transit lasted between 116 and 124 seconds.

<doc id="731721" wikidata="Q939395" url="?curid=731721" title="Jordi Mollà">
<text>Jordi Mollà Perales () is a Spanish actor, artist, writer, and filmmaker. He has been nominated three times for the Goya Award for Best Actor for &quot;The Lucky Star&quot; (1997), &quot;Second Skin&quot; (1999), and &quot;El cónsul de Sodoma&quot; (1999).

==Early life and education==
Jordi Mollà y Perales was born and raised in Barcelona, Spain. He trained at the Institut del Teatre, and furthered his studies in Italy, Hungary, and England. His mother tongues are Catalan and Spanish, and he is fluent in English, Italian, and French.

==Career==
===Acting===
Mollà breakout role was in Bigas Luna&#x27;s 1992 comedy drama &quot;Jamón, jamón,&quot; where he played the jilted lover of Penélope Cruz&#x27;s character. Mollà went on to star in other acclaimed films in his native country, including &quot;Stories from the Kronen&quot; and &quot;La Celestina.&quot; The latter earned him his first Goya Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. His subsequent starring role in &quot;The Lucky Star&quot; earned him widespread acclaim, earning him a Premios Ondas, a Butaca Award for Best Catalan Actor, and another Goya nomination, this time for Best Actor. He has since been nominated twice more, for &quot;Second Skin&quot; and &quot;El cónsul de Sodoma.&quot;

Mollà made his Hollywood debut in the 2001 biographical crime film &quot;Blow,&quot; where he played a villainous drug trafficker based on Carlos Lehder. Mollà subsequently played a similar character in Michael Bay&#x27;s 2003 action sequel &quot;Bad Boys II,&quot; opposite Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. His co-star Gabrielle Union labeled him as &quot;The Tom Cruise of Spain,&quot; when praising his performance as drug lord Johnny Tapia. Mollà then starred in &quot;The Tulse Luper Suitcases&quot;, an ambitious multi-year, multi-media project created by avant-garde director Peter Greenaway.

<text>The Mescaleros were the British backing band for British singer, musician and songwriter Joe Strummer, formed in 1999, which issued three albums prior to Strummer&#x27;s death in 2002.

Many of the band members were multi-instrumentalists. The original line up consisted of Strummer on vocals and guitar; Antony Genn on guitar; Scott Shields on bass, guitar and drums; Martin Slattery on keyboards, guitar, occasional flute and saxophone; Pablo Cook on percussion; Steve &quot;Smiley&quot; Barnard on drums; and Richard Flack on various instruments.

The Mescaleros arose from Strummer&#x27;s work with Pablo Cook and Richard Norris. The three of them originally came together to write the soundtracks for two short films, &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;, and &quot;Question of Honour&quot;. The song &quot;Yalla Yalla&quot; was originally written by this trio, and mixed by Antony Genn. Once Genn was brought on board, a new song &quot;Techno D-Day&quot; was recorded, at which point Strummer, at the behest of Genn, began recording a new record.

The original drummer, Ged Lynch, left the band before recording on the &quot;Rock Art and the X-Ray Style&quot; album was complete and Steve Barnard, previously with Robbie Williams, was brought in to finish recording. Shields and Slattery were recruited through a number of contacts with the band. Slattery had also appeared on Williams&#x27; &quot;Life thru a Lens&quot; album, and Shields was a friend of Slattery&#x27;s. Oddly enough, in the initial lineup, only Smiley was playing the instrument which he knew best.

Genn reportedly did not have the ability to play sufficient lead guitar, so multi-instrumentalist Slattery, originally trained on horns and keyboards, was brought in. Strummer once joked that Slattery could play a hole in the windshield of the tour bus. Shields had previously been a drummer but was recruited to play bass, and later played guitar.

==History==
The Mescaleros&#x27; first gig was on 5 June 1999 at the Leadmill in Antony Genn&#x27;s hometown of Sheffield. They toured extensively for the next six months in the US and Europe, appearing as well at the Glastonbury Festival. In 2000 the band played Big Day Out in Australia and New Zealand, as well as touring Japan.

The band signed with the Californian punk label Hellcat Records, and issued three albums. Following the release of the first, &quot;Rock Art and the X-Ray Style&quot;, they toured England and North America; sets included several Clash-fan favourites.

Singer-songwriter Tymon Dogg, a longtime friend of Joe Strummer, joined the band in 2000 playing violin and Spanish guitar. He contributed some of the tunes on &quot;Global a Go-Go&quot;, including &quot;Mondo Bongo&quot;.

Honorary Mescaleros include John Blackburn and Jimmy Hogarth, both of whom played bass in place of Scott Shields on the 2000 tour supporting the Who, which was also Tymon Dogg&#x27;s first tour with the band. Andy Boo, Strummer&#x27;s guitar tech, also appeared in the Mescaleros line up in place of Pablo Cook on percussion at a gig in Finland 1999.

Following the departure of Genn and Smiley, Scott Shields moved to guitar, Simon Stafford was brought on board to play bass, and Luke Bullen was recruited to play drums. Pablo Cook left in August 2001 to join Moby.

Following the release of &quot;Global a Go-Go&quot;, Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros mounted a 21-date tour of North America, Britain, and Ireland. Once again, these concerts featured Clash material (&quot;London Calling&quot;, &quot;Rudie Can&#x27;t Fail&quot;), as well as classic covers of reggae hits (&quot;The Harder They Come&quot;, &quot;A Message to You, Rudy&quot;) and regularly closed the show with a nod to Joey Ramone by playing the Ramones&#x27; &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot;.

Musically, the Mescaleros continued the genre mixing that Strummer was known for during his time with the Clash. Elements of reggae, jazz, funk, hip hop, country, and of course punk rock can be found in the three Mescaleros releases.

The band is also the subject of a documentary by Dick Rude titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Rock Again!&quot; which was released on 27 June 2006. The band also appear on many DVDs (see full list below) and have had several of their songs appear in major films such as &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; and &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot;. One song, &quot;Johnny Appleseed,&quot; was used as the theme song to the HBO series &quot;John From Cincinnati&quot;.

Joe Strummer &amp; the Mescaleros&#x27; last concert was on 22 November 2002, in Liverpool. This show is often overlooked however, in favor of citing the 15 November show at Acton Town Hall. It was this show, which was a benefit for striking fire fighters, that Mick Jones joined Strummer on stage for the first time in nearly twenty years, during the Clash song &quot;Bankrobber&quot;. An encore followed with both &quot;White Riot&quot; and &quot;London&#x27;s Burning&quot;. &quot;The Last Night London Burned&quot;, a 64-page book written by George Binette, showing never before published pictures of Joe Strummer and Mick Jones, and a 26-minute film by Gregg McDonald and Alan Miles, were released as a unique visual record of that last London concert by Joe Strummer &amp; the Mescaleros. Following the conclusion of this tour, the band headed straight for the studio, but Strummer died of a congenital heart defect on 22 December 2002 after returning home from walking his dogs.

The band&#x27;s final album &quot;Streetcore&quot; was released, after Strumer&#x27;s death, on 20 October 2003.

The band also made appearances on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, as well as touring on the Hootenany Festival in the summer of 2001.

Various Mescaleros members have performed at numerous tribute concerts in both UK and Europe. Pablo Cook and Smiley together with Mike Peters (the Alarm), Derek Forbes (Simple Minds), Steve Harris (Gary Numan) are members of Los Mondo Bongo, a celebration of the music of Joe Strummer, who together with Ray Gange (DJ) tour whenever possible, performing Mescaleros tunes.

Antony Genn currently fronts the Hours, a band that he and Martin Slattery formed in 2004.

In an October 2013 interview with BBC 6 Music, Mick Jones confirmed that in the months prior to Strummer&#x27;s death, the two were writing new music together. At the time, Jones assumed the new songs would be on an upcoming Mescaleros album. But months later he ran into Strummer at an event, and Strummer informed him that the music was intended for a new Clash album.

<doc id="731726" wikidata="Q470190" url="?curid=731726" title="James Arness">
<text>James Arness (born James King Aurness; May 26, 1923 – June 3, 2011) was an American actor, best known for portraying Marshal Matt Dillon for 20 years in the series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. He has the distinction of having played the role of Dillon in five decades: 1955 to 1975 in the weekly series, then in &quot;&quot; (1987) and four more made-for-television &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; films in the 1990s. In Europe, Arness reached cult status for his role as Zeb Macahan in the Western series &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;. He was the older brother of actor Peter Graves.

==Early life==
James Arness was born in Minneapolis. His parents were businessman Rolf Cirkler Aurness and journalist Ruth Duesler. His father&#x27;s ancestry was Norwegian; his mother&#x27;s was German. The family name had been Aursnes, but when Rolf&#x27;s father, Peter Aursnes, emigrated from Norway in 1887, he changed it to Aurness. James Arness and his family were Methodists. Arness&#x27; younger brother was actor Peter Graves. Peter used the stage name &quot;Graves&quot;, a maternal family name.

Arness attended John Burroughs Grade School, Washburn High School, and West High School in Minneapolis. During that time, Arness worked as a courier for a jewelry wholesaler, loading and unloading railway boxcars at the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad freight yards in Minneapolis and logging in Pierce, Idaho. Despite &quot;being a poor student and skipping many classes,&quot; he graduated from high school in June 1942.

Arness entered Beloit College that fall, where he joined the campus choir and became a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity.

==Military service in World War II==
Although Arness wanted to be a naval fighter pilot, he was concerned his poor eyesight would bar him. However, it was his 6-ft, 7-in (2.01 m) frame that ended his chances because the height limit for aviators was set at 6 ft, 2 in (1.88 m). He was drafted into the US Army and reported to Fort Snelling in Hennepin County, Minnesota in March 1943. As a rifleman, he landed on Anzio Beachhead on January 22, 1944, with the 2nd Platoon, E Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division. Arness–because of his height–was the first man to be ordered off the landing craft to determine the depth of the water; it came up to his waist. 

He was severely wounded in his right leg during the Battle of Anzio, and medically evacuated from Italy to the US, where he was sent to the 91st General Hospital in Clinton, Iowa. His brother Peter (later known as actor Peter Graves) came to see him when he was beginning his long recuperation, assuring him to not worry about his injuries, that likely he could find work in the field of radio. After undergoing several surgeries, he was honorably discharged from the Army on January 29, 1945. His wounds continued to trouble him, though, throughout the remainder of his life. In his later years, he suffered from chronic leg pain that often became acute, and was sometimes initiated when he was mounted on horses during his performances on &quot;Gunsmoke.&quot; 

His military decorations included the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the American Campaign Medal, the European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with three bronze battle stars and arrowhead device, the World War II Victory Medal, and the Combat Infantryman Badge.

==Acting career==

After his discharge from the service, Arness began his entertainment career as a radio announcer at Minneapolis station WLOL in 1945.

Determined to find work in films, Arness hitchhiked to Hollywood, where he made the rounds to agencies and casting calls and soon began acting and appearing in films. He made his movie debut at RKO, which immediately changed his name from &quot;Aurness&quot;. His film debut was as Loretta Young&#x27;s (Katie Holstrom) brother, Peter Holstrom, in &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. He was credited in &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot; as Aurness.

Though identified as appearing in Westerns, Arness also acted in two science-fiction films, &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; (in which he portrayed the titular character) and &quot;Them!&quot;. He became a close friend of John Wayne and appeared in supporting roles in &quot;Big Jim McLain&quot;, &quot;Hondo&quot;, &quot;Island in the Sky&quot; and &quot;The Sea Chase&quot;, all starring Wayne. Arness starred in &quot;Gun the Man Down&quot;, a fast-paced Western, for Wayne&#x27;s production company. He also starred in a 1988 TV remake of Wayne&#x27;s 1948 classic &quot;Red River&quot;, appearing in Wayne&#x27;s role as Tom Dunson.

An urban legend has it that John Wayne turned down the starring role of Matt Dillon in the classic television Western &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, instead recommending James Arness for the part. The only true part of this story is that Wayne did indeed recommend Arness for the role; Wayne was never offered the part. Wayne appeared in a prologue to the first episode of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; in 1955, in which he introduced Arness as Matt Dillon. The Norwegian-German Arness had to dye his naturally blond hair darker for the role. Arvo Ojala, who taught Arness to shoot, was the first of several actors in the show&#x27;s opening where Marshal Dillon has a shootout with what is described as &quot;a generic bad guy&quot; representing all those which Dillon must deal with. &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; made Arness and his co-stars, Milburn Stone, Amanda Blake, Dennis Weaver, Ken Curtis, Burt Reynolds, and Buck Taylor world-famous, and ran for two decades, becoming the longest-running primetime drama series in American television history by the end of its run in 1975. The series&#x27; season record was tied in 2010 with the final season of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and tied again in 2018 with season 20 of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;. Unlike the latter show, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; featured its lead character in each of its 20 seasons; &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; also aired 179 more episodes, and was in the top 10 in the ratings for 11 more seasons, for a total of 13, including four consecutive seasons at number one.

After &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; ended, Arness performed in Western-themed movies and television series, including &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;, and in five made-for-television &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; movies between 1987 and 1994. An exception was as a big-city police officer in a short-lived 1981–1982 series, &quot;McClain&#x27;s Law&quot;, starring with Marshall Colt. His role as mountain man Zeb Macahan in &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; made him a cult figure in many European countries, where it became even more popular than in the United States, as the series has been rebroadcast many times across Europe.

&quot;James Arness: An Autobiography&quot; was released in September 2001, with a foreword by Reynolds (who had been a cast member of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; for several years in the 1960s). Arness realized, &quot;[I]f I was going to write a book about my life, I better do it now ... &#x27;cause I&#x27;m not getting any younger.&quot;

==Personal life==
Arness married Virginia Chapman in 1948, and adopted her son Craig (1946 – December 14, 2004). Arness and Chapman also had a son, Rolf (born February 18, 1952), and a daughter, Jenny Lee Arness (May 23, 1950 – May 12, 1975). Rolf Aurness became World Surfing Champion in 1970. Craig Arness founded the stock photography agency Westlight and also was a photographer for &quot;National Geographic&quot;. When they divorced in 1963, Arness was granted legal custody of the children. Daughter Jenny died of an apparently deliberate drug overdose in 1975. His former wife Virginia died of an accidental drug overdose in 1977.

Four years after his divorce from Virginia Chapman, James Arness met Thordis Brandt, who was his girlfriend for six years before they ended their relationship. In 1978, Arness married Janet Surtees. She and his sons survived him.

Despite his stoic character, according to Ben Bates, his &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; stunt double, Arness laughed &quot;from his toes to the top of his head&quot;. Shooting on the &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; set was sometimes suspended because Arness got a case of the uncontrollable giggles. James Arness disdained publicity and banned reporters from the &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; set. He was said to be a shy and sensitive man who enjoyed poetry, yacht racing, and surfing. &quot;TV Guide&quot; dubbed him &quot;The Greta Garbo of Dodge City&quot;. Buck Taylor thought so highly of Arness that he named his second son, Matthew, after Arness&#x27; character.

==Death==
Arness died from natural causes at the age of 88 years at his Brentwood home in Los Angeles on June 3, 2011.

==Awards==

For his contributions to the television industry, Arness has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1751 Vine Street. In 1981, he was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City. Arness was inducted into the Santa Clarita Walk of Western Stars in 2006, and gave a related TV interview.

On the 50th anniversary of television in 1989 in the United States, &quot;People&quot; magazine chose the &quot;top 25 television stars of all time.&quot; Arness was number six. In 1996, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked him number 20 on its &quot;50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time&quot; list.
Arness was nominated for these Emmy Awards:

<doc id="731733" wikidata="Q4678745" url="?curid=731733" title="Adam Blue Galli">
<text>Adam Blue Gallis was one of a group of criminals known as the &quot;Preppie Bandits&quot; (due to their clean cut appearance, a propensity for dressing like &quot;preppies&quot;, and their habit of hanging out in Salt Lake City&#x27;s coffeeshops). They operated in and around Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1992. The other members were his brother Aaron Galli and his cousins Nathan and Christopher. He fled the state after being charged with murder and robbery, and was recaptured after being featured on America&#x27;s Most Wanted. In an odd twist, patrons and employees at the restaurant where the murder occurred were watching the program, and alerted police to the presence of another person featured on the same episode, who was currently working at the same restaurant.

==Armed robberies==
In 1992, Galli, along with his brother Aaron, and two cousins, Nathan and Christopher Galli, committed a string of armed robberies in Salt Lake City. On April 29, 1992, Galli, Nathan and Christopher robbed the King&#x27;s English Bookstore in Salt Lake City. Galli and Christopher went inside the bookstore while Nathan waited outside for the purpose of running interference if the police were called. Galli pointed a gun at the store clerk and took approximately $250 in cash from the two cash registers at the store.

On May 5, 1992, Galli and Christopher, armed with handguns, robbed the Trolley Corners Theaters. While Galli and Christopher were inside the theater, Aaron and Nathan waited outside in a separate car to keep lookout. After stealing approximately $900 in cash from the theater, Galli and Christopher fled, pursued by a witness. Nathan pulled up in the car and told the witness to call the police while he chased the robbers to obtain their license plate number.

On June 6, 1992, Galli, wearing a black wig, entered the Tool Shed and pointed a gun at store clerk Sylvia Nordhoff. He told her, &quot;This is a stickup, give me all of your money or I&#x27;ll kill you.&quot; When Ms. Nordhoff refused to hand over the money, Galli grabbed nearly $180 in cash from the cash register and fled. Ms. Nordoff tackled him just outside the store, where her son Michael helped her hold Galli down. Christopher Galli, who was waiting outside, threatened Ms. Nordhoff and her son with a weapon and told them to let Adam go. Galli and Christopher then ran to their car and drove off. When witnesses attempted to pursue the two men, Nathan drove up and told them to call the police while he chased the robbers. Nathan later returned to the scene and gave false information to the police.

==Charges==
In June and July 1992, Galli was charged with all three armed robberies and warrants for his arrest were issued. On July 10, 1992, he was arrested in King County, Washington. While being held in the King County Jail in Seattle, he was advised of his Miranda rights by two detectives from the Salt Lake City Police Department. Galli voluntarily waived his Miranda rights, and during questioning, confessed to all three robberies. Galli later moved to suppress his statements to the police, contending that during questioning he had reinvoked both his right to counsel and his right to remain silent. His claim that his confession was therefore obtained in violation of Miranda v. Arizona was later denied.

Prior to his trial, Galli was released from custody after his family posted $40,000 bond. However, in November, Galli, facing a total of five charges for armed robbery, fled the state in anticipation of being charged with the May 17, 1992, murder of Green Parrot Restaurant employee Merritt Riordan, murdered during a botched robbery attempt. Galli&#x27;s family forfeited nearly $40,000 in cash and real estate as a result of his flight from justice. The murder charge against Galli was eventually dropped due to lack of evidence.

==Arrest==
In August 1995, Galli, then living under the alias &quot;August Cedergren&quot;, was arrested at his job at a Northfield, Minnesota, cabinetmaking shop following an anonymous tip to the FBI. It is believed the tip came from a Northfield resident who recognized him from a photograph on a Wanted poster in the local Post Office. Upon his return to Utah, Galli pleaded guilty to three of five aggravated robbery counts—the other two charges were dismissed in a plea-bargain deal.

==Sentence==
Judge Pat B. Brian sentenced him to an indeterminate term of five years to life in prison and ordered him to pay $40,000 in restitution to his family for the money they forfeited when he absconded. Judge Glenn K. Iwasaki sentenced him to an indeterminate term of five years to life in prison with his sentence to run consecutively to Judge Brian&#x27;s sentence. Judge Kenneth Rigtrup also sentenced him to five years to life in prison with his sentence to run consecutively to the sentences imposed by Judge Brian and Judge Iwasaki.

==Parole==
A parole board later granted Galli an early release.

&quot;August Cedergren&quot; is currently living in Ely, Minnesota. He also uses the alias &quot;August Settergren&quot;.

<doc id="731734" wikidata="Q734445" url="?curid=731734" title="Luis Muñoz Rivera">
<text>Luis Muñoz Rivera (July 17, 1859 – November 15, 1916) was a Puerto Rican poet, journalist and politician. He was a major figure in the struggle for political autonomy of Puerto Rico in union with Spain.

In 1887, Muñoz Rivera became part of the leadership of a newly formed Autonomist Party. In 1889, he successfully ran a campaign for the position of delegate in the district of Caguas. Subsequently, Muñoz Rivera was a member of a group organized by the party to discuss proposals of autonomy with Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, who would grant Puerto Rico an autonomous government following his election. He served as Chief of the Cabinet of this government.

On August 13, 1898, the Treaty of Paris transferred possession of Puerto Rico from Spain to the United States and a military government was established. In 1899, Muñoz Rivera resigned his position within the cabinet and remained inactive in politics for some time. In 1909, he was elected as Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico and participated in the creation of the Jones-Shafroth Act, proposing amendments before its final approval. Shortly after, Muñoz Rivera contracted an infection and traveled to Puerto Rico, where he died on November 15, 1916. His son, Luis Muñoz Marín would subsequently become involved in politics, becoming the first democratically elected Governor of Puerto Rico.

==Early life==

Luis Muñoz Rivera was born in Barranquitas, Puerto Rico, to Luis Muñoz Barrios and Monserrate Rivera Vazquez. He was the couple&#x27;s first child and a banquet was offered in celebration. He came from a middle-class family and was not part of Puerto Rico&#x27;s elite. His father came from one of the first patriarchal lines in Puerto Rico&#x27;s politics.

His Paternal Grandfather Luis Muñoz Iglesias was from Castile in central Spain who decided to make his career in the army and received several recognitions after participating against Simón Bolívar during the Admirable Campaign, and followed his commanding officer Miguel de la Torre to Puerto Rico. He settled in a farm in Cidra, Puerto Rico, married María Escolástica Barrios and fathered twelve children. He became the town&#x27;s first mayor from 1818 to 1820 and again in 1840 to 1850.

During Muñoz Rivera&#x27;s childhood, Barranquitas was a small rural town. The family&#x27;s house was moderately large for the time; it was built with wood and its roof was made with zinc. When he was four, his mother home-schooled him with books from a private library owned by his father. By the age of ten, Muñoz Rivera completed the education offered in the town&#x27;s school, and finished first in his class. He was educated in Spanish and French, and took music classes with Jorge Colombani. His father hired private tutors to continue his instruction. Muñoz Rivera was a serious student with a strong interest in Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; works, in particular &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. Other authors that he studied include Fernando de Herrera, Tirso de Molina, Luis de Góngora, and Lope de Vega.

When Muñoz Rivera was twelve years old, his mother fell ill and died. By this time, the family had grown to include nine more siblings, whom he taught. By the age of fourteen, Muñoz Rivera was managing legal documents, working with the local church clergy, and helping in his father&#x27;s store. There were no institutions of higher learning on the island at that time, and most families sent their children to Cuba (University of la Habana, founded in 1728), Spain or North America to complete their university education. Muñoz Rivera wanted to travel to Spain and study law, but his father wanted him to take care of the family&#x27;s business.

==Political career==

===Early involvement in politics and poetry===
Early in his life, Muñoz Rivera began writing poetry. However, he did not publish any of his work until he was 23 years old. In 1882, Mario Braschi, an editor working for a newspaper named &quot;El Pueblo&quot;, accepted to publish a poem titled &quot;¡Adelante!&quot;. Braschi advised Muñoz Rivera to continue writing, urging him to concentrate on science and politics, instead of authoring love poems. Muñoz Rivera then began writing about Puerto Rico&#x27;s political status, promoting the necessity of an autonomous government.

Even though his father was a member of the Conservative Party, Muñoz Rivera decided to follow his uncle, Vicente Muñoz Barrios ideals and in 1883 joined the Liberal Party. While working within the organization, Muñoz Rivera established a store along Quintín Negrón Sanjurjo, which had limited success. He gained the confidence of the Liberal Party and was named president of Barranquitas&#x27; committee and became a member of the municipal council. In 1885, Muñoz Rivera ran for a position in the Juana Diaz district&#x27;s representation in the Provincial Assembly, but he was not elected. That same year, he began publishing his writings in newspapers and magazines, including &quot;El Clamor del Pueblo&quot;, &quot;La Revista de Puerto Rico&quot; and &quot;El Pueblo&quot;. Other poems published by Muñoz Rivera were: &quot;Retamas&quot;, &quot;Tropicales&quot;, &quot;Horas de Fiebre&quot;, &quot;El paso del déspota&quot;, &quot;Minha terra&quot;, &quot;Cuba rebelde&quot;, &quot;A cualquier compatriota&quot;, &quot;Las campanas&quot;, &quot;Turba multa&quot;, &quot;Alea jacta est&quot;, &quot;Judas&quot;, &quot;El general&quot;, &quot;Abismos&quot;, &quot;Patriota&quot;, &quot;Himno&quot;, &quot;Parias&quot; and &quot;Poemas Liricos&quot;.

===Establishing an autonomous government===
In January 1887, members of the Liberal Party organized a convention in Coamo where they discussed the reorganization of the party. In this activity he met Román Baldorioty de Castro, who became his mentor, regarding Muñoz Rivera as a &quot;disciple&quot;. A new party called the Autonomist Party was created following this reunion, which also included José Celso Barbosa and José de Diego. The organization&#x27;s ideology pursued the creation of a separate government for Puerto Rico, while keeping some relationship with Spain.

The Autonomist Party&#x27;s base grew rapidly, in part due to Muñoz Rivera&#x27;s writings and speeches directed toward the &quot;jíbaro&quot; population. The Conservative Party considered this a threat and closed the newspapers where he published his work, sending part of their staff to jail in Fort San Felipe del Morro. After Francisco Cepeda Taborcias, editor of &quot;La Revista de Puerto Rico&#x27;s&quot; was jailed, the position was offered to Muñoz Rivera, who accepted it. After being released from prison, Cepeda criticized Baldorioty de Castro&#x27;s policies. Cepeda was elected secretary of the party and Baldorioty de Castro was named honorary president. This action angered Muñoz Rivera, who challenged him to a duel. Cepeda originally accepted the challenge, but later declined the same once the preparations were underway, losing his position within the party&#x27;s hierarchy.

As 1887 progressed, the conflicts between liberals and conservatives worsened, with governor Palacio ordering the arrest of more than a hundred liberals. The political tension increased and the year became known as &quot;The Terrible Year&quot;. Palavio also prohibited any person from leaving Puerto Rico with the intention of preventing any actions from Spain. However, the liberals were able to send Juan Arrillaga Roque to Madrid, where he made the situation public. Upon learning of this, Alfonso XII replaced Palacio with Juan Contreras Martinez. In 1889, Muñoz Rivera was nominated as the Liberal Party&#x27;s delegate for the district of Juana Diaz. However, his father was nominated for the same position by the Conservative Party and he moved his nomination to the district of Caguas out of respect. He won the election, which was admitted with the conservatives&#x27; opposition.

On July 1, 1890, he founded the party&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;La Democracía&quot;, in Ponce, Puerto Rico. The publication was mostly directed towards politics, but it also included poetry and stories published by Puerto Rican artists. The newspaper brought immediate controversy, which eventually led to Muñoz Rivera&#x27;s arrest. Protest were organized throughout Puerto Rico and he was released after his father paid 15,000 pesetas as bond. Muñoz Rivera sold his half of the store, in order to raise funds for the publication&#x27;s establishment.

In 1893, he married Amalia Marín in a ceremony that took place in Ponce Cathedral. Later that year, he traveled to Spain to learn about its political system. There he realized that Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, president of the Fusion Party, was the better option to help in this task. While in Spain, Muñoz Rivera received notice that his father had died, which heavily affected him. Upon returning to Puerto Rico, he published an article about his father in &quot;La Democracia&quot;. He subsequently noticed that his travel had caused controversy within the Autonomist Party, which became divided between followers of Barbosa and Muñoz Rivera, with the two factions becoming known as &quot;Muñocistas&quot; and &quot;Barbosistas&quot;.

Barbosa&#x27;s group opposed allying with Sagasta, claiming that he was a monarchist while they were supporting the establishment of a republic. Meanwhile, Muñoz Rivera participated in the writing of the &quot;Plan de Ponce&quot; which proposed administrative autonomy for the island. After several debates, the Autonomist Party agreed to send four men to reunite with Libera Fusion Party in the organization&#x27;s behalf, including Muñoz Rivera. Sagasta proposed that if he won the premiership of Spain, Puerto Rico would receive a Chapter of Autonomy which would give it the same degree of sovereignty that the Spanish provinces had. Upon learning of this, most of the &quot;Barbosistas&quot; resigned, forming a new institution named the Orthodox Autonomist Party. Sagasta became Spain&#x27;s prime minister following the power vacuum that occurred after the assassination of Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, and in December 1897 he granted the promised autonomous government. Muñoz Rivera changed the party&#x27;s name to Liberal Party of Puerto Rico and served as Secretary of Grace, Justice and Government and Chief of the Cabinet for the independent government of Puerto Rico.

===American invasion and military government===
On February 18, 1898, Muñoz Rivera&#x27;s son, Luis Muñoz Marín, was born. By this time the family had moved to Old San Juan, where Luis was born. On February 16, 1898, Barbosa rushed to Muñoz Rivera&#x27;s home. He had just learned that the American vessel USS Maine had sunk off the coast of Cuba, which would most likely spark a war between Spain and the United States. Barbosa expected the American government to grant Puerto Rico autonomy if they gained control. However, Muñoz Rivera was saddened by the news, knowing that the United States was planning to build a canal in Panama, and that Puerto Rico would be a strategic location to protect the structure. Barbosa insisted that this would not happen, continuing his support towards a military operation.

On May 12, 1898, the United States Navy bombarded San Juan, initiating the Puerto Rican Campaign. Initially, the Liberal Party supported the Spanish government, although several members agreed with Barbosa. Muñoz Rivera took possession of Chief of the Cabinet&#x27;s position for the Autonomous Government on July 21. Four days later, on July 25, the United States Army landed in Guánica led by Nelson A. Miles, beginning the land offensive. On August 13, the signing of the Treaty of Paris was made public, bringing a halt to all military offensives in Puerto Rico. As part of this amnesty, Spain ceded Cuba and Puerto Rico, converting the archipelago into a possession of the United States under military governorship. The &quot;Barbosistas&quot; welcomed the American government, but Muñoz Rivera expected them to keep Puerto Rico as a possession. He refused to cooperate with the military government and returned to Barranquitas, where he wrote a poem titled &quot;Sísifo&quot;, comparing Puerto Rico&#x27;s political situation to Sisyphus&#x27; punishment. He subsequently returned to San Juan, accepting a request made by John R. Brooke to continue in his office within the new cabinet. Muñoz Rivera assisted in establishing an insular police. Brooke was replaced by Guy Vernon Henry as military governor. Following this change, both men began having violent discussions, with each one trying to push their positions. Muñoz Rivera would vocally debate several of Brooke&#x27;s decisions, with both communicating via an interpreter.

On February 4, 1899, he resigned from the position of president of the Council of Secretaries. Puerto Rico was experiencing a serious economic crisis, many problems arising from the population&#x27;s inability to communicate with the Americans. Universal election suffrage was canceled, reducing the voting population by more than 85%. Henry eventually dissolved the Cabinet, removing the final remnants of recognition of the autonomous government established under Spanish rule. Muñoz Rivera opposed the military structure and promoted autonomy. Later that year, he founded the newspaper &quot;El Territorio&quot;, which voiced the concerns of landowners that were being affected by a blockade imposed by the United States. On April 12, 1900, William McKinley signed the Foraker Act, which proposed the end of the military government and the establishment of a civil government. A Supreme Court was created with five members, all of which were American functionaries appointed by the United States President. The position of Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico was also enacted. The &quot;Barbosistas&quot; considered this law an advance, eventually creating a new institution named the Republican Party of Puerto Rico. Muñoz Rivera published heavy criticism towards them in &quot;El Diario&quot;, which angered the members of the new organization. Rumors of an assassination attempt became widespread, and several of his friends visited his house armed. A discussion between both sides concluded with gunfire, leaving no one injured, some of the perpetrators escaped. Muñoz Rivera and those present were arrested and charged with &quot;armed assault&quot;, but the charge was dropped when he established that he acted in self-defense. The Foraker act failed to prevent the monopolization of land, and allowed four American corporations to control of most of Puerto Rico&#x27;s agricultural terrains.

== Last years and death ==
The United States eventually designed a program to &quot;Americanize&quot; Puerto Rico. One day while working for an article in &quot;El Diario&quot;, a friend of Muñoz Rivera brought a newspaper informing that all education in Puerto Rican public schools would be taught in English. He was surprised by the announcement, expressing that the plan would fail due to lack of teachers with knowledge in the language. Muñoz Rivera began publishing articles directed towards the &quot;jíbaro&quot; population, in which he promoted self-government for Puerto Rico.

In 1901, a group of statehood supporters broke into the &quot;El Diario&#x27;s&quot; building, vandalizing most of the equipment. Following this incident, the family moved to Caguas where he reopened &quot;La Democracia&quot;. After receiving further threats from the statehood movements, Muñoz Rivera decided to move to New York City, not before leaving the paper&#x27;s editing in charge of one of his followers. There he founded the bilingual newspaper &quot;Puerto Rico Herald&quot;, in which he heavily criticized the United States&#x27; stance on Puerto Rico. During the following years, the family constantly traveled between both locations. Muñoz Rivera, together with Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón, Antonio R. Barceló, José de Diego and Juan Vías Ochoteco founded the Union of Puerto Rico party, which won the election in 1904. Following the party&#x27;s victory, he was selected as a member the House of Delegates.

In 1910, Muñoz Rivera ran for Resident Commissioner in the United States House of Representatives representing the Union of Puerto Rico party, and served from 1911 to 1916. After spending nearly a year perfecting his English, Muñoz Rivera began forming friendships with some congressmen. Among these were Henry L. Stimpson and Felix Frankfurter. In 1915 Muñoz Rivera proposed granting Puerto Rico greater autonomy without requesting independence from the United States, and equal rights without becoming a state. His proposal was greeted by opposition from many members of his party including José de Diego. Still in the end, his party agreed on his proposal.

On March 2, 1917, the Jones-Shafroth Act was signed, granting United States citizenship to Puerto Ricans and creating a bicameral Legislative Assembly. Still, he was not pleased with the Jones Act since the judicial and executive branches were still controlled by the United States. On March 16, 1916, he gave a speech in the house floor that seemed to argue in favor and against American citizenship. He declared that if the earth were to swallow the island, Puerto Ricans would prefer American citizenship to any citizenship in the world. But as long as the island existed, the residents preferred Puerto Rican citizenship.

Shortly afterwards, he became ill and returned to Puerto Rico to recuperate. In late 1916, Eduardo Georgetti, a friend of the family, summoned his wife and son to Puerto Rico and informed them that he was suffering from an infection that had begun in the galbladder, before expanding throughout his body. Luis Muñoz Rivera died on November 15, 1916, in the town of San Juan, before the Jones Act was enacted into law. When he died, the town&#x27;s bells were tolled and &quot;La Borinqueña&quot; was sung by those present. The funeral procession began five days after his death It traveled throughout Puerto Rico and was attended by thousands of people along the way. Some &quot;Jíbaros&quot; traveled between municipalities to attend more than one part of the activity. Muñoz&#x27; remains were buried at the Muñoz Rivera Family Mausoleum in Barranquitas, Puerto Rico.

==Legacy and honors==

<text>A Java class file is a file (with the filename extension) containing Java bytecode that can be executed on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). A Java class file is usually produced by a Java compiler from Java programming language source files ( files) containing Java classes (alternatively, other JVM languages can also be used to create class files). If a source file has more than one class, each class is compiled into a separate class file. Thus, it is called a file because it contains the bytecode for a single class.

JVMs are available for many platforms, and a class file compiled on one platform will execute on a JVM of another platform. This makes Java applications platform-independent.

==History==
On 11 December 2006, the class file format was modified under Java Specification Request (JSR) 202.

==File layout and structure==

===Sections===
There are 10 basic sections to the Java class file structure:
* Magic Number: 0xCAFEBABE
* Version of Class File Format: the minor and major versions of the class file
* Constant Pool: Pool of constants for the class
* Access Flags: for example whether the class is abstract, static, etc.
* This Class: The name of the current class
* Super Class: The name of the super class
* Interfaces: Any interfaces in the class
* Fields: Any fields in the class
* Methods: Any methods in the class
* Attributes: Any attributes of the class (for example the name of the sourcefile, etc.)

===Magic Number===
Class files are identified by the following 4 byte header (in hexadecimal): codice_1 (the first 4 entries in the table below). The history of this magic number was explained by James Gosling referring to a restaurant in Palo Alto:

&quot;We used to go to lunch at a place called St Michael&#x27;s Alley. According to local legend, in the deep dark past, the Grateful Dead used to perform there before they made it big. It was a pretty funky place that was definitely a Grateful Dead Kinda Place. When Jerry died, they even put up a little Buddhist-esque shrine. When we used to go there, we referred to the place as Cafe Dead. Somewhere along the line it was noticed that this was a HEX number. I was re-vamping some file format code and needed a couple of magic numbers: one for the persistent object file, and one for classes. I used CAFEDEAD for the object file format, and in grepping for 4 character hex words that fit after &quot;CAFE&quot; (it seemed to be a good theme) I hit on BABE and decided to use it.
At that time, it didn&#x27;t seem terribly important or destined to go anywhere but the trash-can of history. So CAFEBABE became the class file format, and CAFEDEAD was the persistent object format. But the persistent object facility went away, and along with it went the use of CAFEDEAD - it was eventually replaced by RMI.&quot;
===General layout===
Because the class file contains variable-sized items and does not also contain embedded file offsets (or pointers), it is typically parsed sequentially, from the first byte toward the end. At the lowest level the file format is described in terms of a few fundamental data types:

* u1: an unsigned 8-bit integer
* u2: an unsigned 16-bit integer in big-endian byte order
* u4: an unsigned 32-bit integer in big-endian byte order
* table: an array of variable-length items of some type. The number of items in the table is identified by a preceding count number (the count is a u2), but the size in bytes of the table can only be determined by examining each of its items.

Some of these fundamental types are then re-interpreted as higher-level values (such as strings or floating-point numbers), depending on context.
There is no enforcement of word alignment, and so no padding bytes are ever used.
The overall layout of the class file is as shown in the following table.

===Representation in a C-like programming language===
Since C doesn&#x27;t support multiple variable length arrays within a struct, the code below won&#x27;t compile and only serves as a demonstration.

struct Class_File_Format {
 u4 magic_number;

 u2 minor_version; 
 u2 major_version;

 u2 constant_pool_count; 
 cp_info constant_pool[constant_pool_count - 1];

 u2 access_flags;

 u2 this_class;
 u2 super_class;

 u2 interfaces_count; 
 u2 interfaces[interfaces_count];

 u2 fields_count; 
 field_info fields[fields_count];

 u2 methods_count;
 method_info methods[methods_count];

 u2 attributes_count; 
 attribute_info attributes[attributes_count];


===The constant pool===

The constant pool table is where most of the literal constant values are stored. This includes values such as numbers of all sorts, strings, identifier names, references to classes and methods, and type descriptors. All indexes, or references, to specific constants in the constant pool table are given by 16-bit (type u2) numbers, where index value 1 refers to the first constant in the table (index value 0 is invalid).

Due to historic choices made during the file format development, the number of constants in the constant pool table is not actually the same as the constant pool count which precedes the table. First, the table is indexed starting at 1 (rather than 0), but the count should actually be interpreted as the maximum index plus one. Additionally, two types of constants (longs and doubles) take up two consecutive slots in the table, although the second such slot is a phantom index that is never directly used.

The type of each item (constant) in the constant pool is identified by an initial byte &quot;tag&quot;. The number of bytes following this tag and their interpretation are then dependent upon the tag value. The valid constant types and their tag values are:

There are only two integral constant types, integer and long. Other integral types appearing in the high-level language, such as boolean, byte, and short must be represented as an integer constant.

Class names in Java, when fully qualified, are traditionally dot-separated, such as &quot;java.lang.Object&quot;. However within the low-level Class reference constants, an internal form appears which uses slashes instead, such as &quot;java/lang/Object&quot;.

The Unicode strings, despite the moniker &quot;UTF-8 string&quot;, are not actually encoded according to the Unicode standard, although it is similar. There are two differences (see UTF-8 for a complete discussion). The first is that the code point U+0000 is encoded as the two-byte sequence codice_2 (in hex) instead of the standard single-byte encoding codice_3. The second difference is that supplementary characters (those outside the BMP at U+10000 and above) are encoded using a surrogate-pair construction similar to UTF-16 rather than being directly encoded using UTF-8. In this case each of the two surrogates is encoded separately in UTF-8. For example, U+1D11E is encoded as the 6-byte sequence codice_4, rather than the correct 4-byte UTF-8 encoding of codice_5.

<doc id="731736" wikidata="Q4875893" url="?curid=731736" title="Beachworld">
<text>&quot;Beachworld&quot; is a science fiction short story by Stephen King, first published in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in 1984, and collected in King&#x27;s 1985 collection &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot;.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Beachworld&quot; is set in an undefined distant future. Among the few clues to the date is the passing reference that the last of the Beach Boys died eight thousand years ago (hence, approximately in the 11th millennium CE).

Two crewmembers, Rand and Shapiro, survive the crash-landing of their spacecraft on an uncharted planet made up entirely of sand. Rand becomes hypnotized by the endless dunes and refuses to either move from the very spot he&#x27;s standing on or drink water. Shapiro also feels drawn to the dunes but, unlike Rand, finds this hypnosis frightening and is relieved to go inside their shipwreck, where the dunes are out of sight. At one point he sees, or imagines, how the unnamed world once hosted civilized intelligent life, but over time the cities, bodies of water, and ultimately everything on the planet was overtaken and buried by the sand.

When another spacecraft arrives in response to Shapiro&#x27;s distress beacon, the crew initially treat his account with skepticism. Rand fights them off, drawing strength from his eroded sanity. The captain sends out an android to force Rand to leave, but it quickly breaks down as sand gets into it. The sand also rises up to stop a tranquilizer dart a crewman fires at Rand. As the black glass burned into the sand by the ship&#x27;s thrusters on landing steadily crumbles, the captain finally heeds Shapiro&#x27;s demands to leave. The ship lifts off, narrowly managing to reach escape velocity as a giant hand-shaped wave of sand tries to bring it down. Rand stares up at the ship as it disappears and begins to pile handfuls of sand into his mouth.

==Adaptations==

A live action version of Beachworld was released in 2015 by filmmaker Chad Bolling.

Another live action version of &quot;Beachworld&quot; from OneNinth &amp; Pointed Pictures premiered online in 2021 as part of the Stephen King Rules Dollar Baby Film Festival.
