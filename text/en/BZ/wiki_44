<text>Volkwin von Naumburg zu Winterstätten (also &quot;Wolquin, Folkwin, Folkvin, Wolguinus, Wolgulin&quot;, Middle High German: &quot;Volkewîn&quot;; died 22 September 1236) was the Master (&quot;Herrenmeister&quot;) of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword from 1209 to 1236.

== Life and death ==
Originally from Naumburg, Germany, Volkwin succeeded Wenno von Rohrbach, the first master of the order. Volkwin led the Sword-Brothers in the Northern Crusades in Latvia and Estonia against the Samogitians, Curonians, Semigallians, and Selonians. He was ultimately killed by the Samogitians during the course of the Battle of Saule in 1236. The surviving Sword-Brothers were subsequently assimilated into the Teutonic Knights led by Hermann Balk, becoming its autonomous branch, the Livonian Order.

<text>97 Klotho is a fairly large main-belt asteroid. While it is an M-type, its radar albedo is too low to allow a nickel-iron composition. Klotho is similar to 21 Lutetia and 22 Kalliope in that all three are M-types of unknown composition. Klotho was found by Ernst Tempel on February 17, 1868. It was his fifth and final asteroid discovery. It is named after Klotho or Clotho, one of the three Moirai, or Fates, in Greek mythology.

13-cm radar observations of this asteroid from the Arecibo Observatory between 1980 and 1985 were used to produce a diameter estimate of 108 km.

In 1990, the asteroid was observed for four nights from the Collurania-Teramo Observatory in Italy, producing an asymmetric light curve that showed a rotation period of 10.927 ± 0.001 hours and a brightness variation of 0.17 ± 0.02 in magnitude. This period confirms a value independently determined in 1971.

<text>Karl-Erik Sixten Sason (born Sixten Andersson; 1912–1967) was a Swedish industrial designer, noted for his work in designing several generations of Saab automobiles.

==Biographical==
Sason was born in 1912, the son of a Swedish sculptor. He trained in Paris as an artist and later as an industrial designer. He had a stint in the Swedish Air Force until an injury disqualified him for flight. In the 1930s he became noted for his &quot;x-ray&quot; renderings of industrial products.

==Career with Saab==
Sason started working for Saab, designing aircraft throughout World War II. In 1946, he was asked to contribute to Project 92, the result of which would be the first Saab automobile, the Saab 92 which began production in 1949. Sason remained with Saab, designing the 93, 95, 96, and 99, as well as the first Sonett. Following his death in 1967, Sason was succeeded by his colleague and one-time student, Björn Envall.

Many of the design elements that Sason implemented in the 99 continued as elements of Saab design into the 1990s.

==Other industrial designs==
In addition to Saab, Sason designed consumer products for Electrolux (most notably the Z 70 vacuum cleaner in 1957), Hasselblad, where he designed their first camera model in 1949, and Husqvarna, designing such motorcycles as the , a high performance lightweight 175cc sold 1955–1965.

<text>98 Ianthe is a large main-belt asteroid, named for in Greek mythology. It is very dark and is composed of carbonates. It was one of the numerous (for his time—the 19th century) discoveries by C. H. F. Peters, who found it on April 18, 1868, from Clinton, New York.

This body is orbiting the Sun with a period of 4.41 years and an eccentricity of 0.186. The orbital plane is inclined at an angle of 15.6° to the plane of the ecliptic. Measurements of the cross-section dimension yield a size of around 105 km. Photometric observations of this asteroid during 2007 at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico were used to create a light curve plot. This showed a synodic rotation period of  hours and a brightness variation of magnitude during each cycle. It is classified as a C-type asteroid, indicating a dark, carbonaceous surface.

The detection of a candidate moon orbiting 98 Ianthe was announced in 2004.

<text>99 Dike () is a quite large and dark main-belt asteroid. Dike was discovered by Alphonse Borrelly on May 28, 1868. It was his first asteroid discovery. This object is named after Dike, the Greek goddess of moral justice. Among the first hundred numbered minor planets, 99 Dike was considered anomalously faint for over a century. However, this was later found to be untrue.

This asteroid is orbiting the Sun with a period of 4.35 years and an eccentricity of 0.19. Its orbital plane is inclined by 13.8° to the plane of the ecliptic. The body spans a diameter of 69 km and it is classified as a C-type asteroid, which indicates it has a dark, carbonaceous surface. Based upon a light curve that was generated from photometric observations of this asteroid at Pulkovo Observatory, it has a rotation period of 18.127 ± 0.002 hours and varies in brightness by 0.22 ± 0.02 in magnitude. However, according to Shrindan E. (2009) the rotation period is rather of 10.360 ± 0.001 h.

The asteroid is located near the Juno clump of asteroids, but is most likely unrelated.

<doc id="738084" wikidata="Q3404273" url="?curid=738084" title="Parliamentary privilege">
<text>Parliamentary privilege is a legal immunity enjoyed by members of certain legislatures, in which legislators are granted protection against civil or criminal liability for actions done or statements made in the course of their legislative duties. It is common in countries whose constitutions are based on the Westminster system.

== Origins ==
In the United Kingdom, parliamentary privilege allows members of the House of Lords and House of Commons to speak freely during ordinary parliamentary proceedings without fear of legal action on the grounds of slander, contempt of court or breaching the Official Secrets Act. It also means that members of Parliament cannot be arrested on civil matters for statements made or acts undertaken as an MP within the grounds of the Palace of Westminster, on the condition that such statements or acts occur as part of a &quot;proceeding in Parliament&quot;—for example, as a question to the Prime Minister in the House of Commons. This allows Members to raise questions or debate issues which could slander an individual, interfere with an ongoing court case or threaten to reveal state secrets, such as in the Zircon affair or several cases mentioned by the Labour MP Tam Dalyell.

There is no immunity from arrest on criminal grounds, nor does the civil privilege entirely extend to the devolved administrations in Scotland or Wales. A consequence of the privilege of free speech is that legislators in Westminster systems are forbidden by conventions of their House from uttering certain words, or implying that another member is lying. (See unparliamentary language.)

The rights and privileges of members are overseen by the powerful Commons Select Committee of Privileges. If a member of the House is in breach of the rules then he/she can be suspended or even expelled from the House. Such past breaches have included giving false evidence before a committee of the House and the taking of bribes by members.

Similar rights apply in other Westminster system countries such as Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. 

Parliamentary privilege is controversial because of its potential for abuse; a member can use privilege to make damaging allegations that would ordinarily be discouraged by defamation laws, whether or not those allegations have a strong foundation. A member could, even more seriously, undermine national security and/or the safety of an ongoing military or covert operation or undermine relations with a foreign state by releasing sensitive military or diplomatic information.

== By country ==
=== Australia ===

Like in other countries, Parliamentary privilege in Australia is granted to those who participate in “proceedings in Parliament” from outside interference or suit.

Freedom of speech is considered one of the most important privileges. 
Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1689 states:
&quot;That the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any Court or place out of Parliament.&quot;

Freedom from prosecution is incorporated in Australian law by section 49 of the Constitution and by section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987.

Members of parliament taking part in proceedings in parliament enjoy absolute privilege. They may not be prosecuted if they make defamatory statements of an opponent during the heat of debate, nor can they be prosecuted if they make a statement that would be considered a criminal offence outside of the parliamentary chamber.

The privilege of freedom of speech is also granted to those taking part in ‘proceedings in parliament’ such as witnesses who give evidence to properly constituted parliamentary committees. 

=== Canada ===
In Canada, the Senate and House of Commons and provincial legislative assemblies follow the definition of parliamentary privilege offered by the British parliamentary authority, &quot;Erskine May&#x27;s Treatise on The Law, Privileges, Proceedings and Usage of Parliament&quot;, which defines parliamentary privilege as &quot;the sum of the peculiar rights enjoyed by each House collectively as a constituent part of the High Court of Parliament, and by Members of each house individually, without which they could not discharge their function... the privileges of Parliament are rights which are absolutely necessary for the due execution of its powers. They are enjoyed by individual Members, because the House cannot perform its functions without unimpeded use of the service of its Members, and by each House for the protection of its members and the vindication of its own authority and dignity.&quot; Parliamentary privilege can therefore be claimed by Members individually or by the House collectively.

The rule for when parliamentary privilege applies is that it cannot exceed the powers, privileges and immunities of the imperial parliament as it stood in 1867, when the first constitution was written.

Individual parliamentary privileges include:
# Freedom of speech
# Freedom from arrest in civil action
# Exemption from jury duty
# Exemption from appearing as a witness
# Freedom from obstruction, interference, intimidation and molestation

Collective parliamentary privileges include:
# Power to discipline
# Regulation of the House&#x27;s internal affairs
# Management of employees
# Authority to maintain the attendance and service of Members
# Right to institute inquiries and to call witnesses and demand papers
# Right to administer oaths to witnesses
# Right to publish papers containing defamatory material

The Supreme Court of Canada has previously dealt with the question of parliamentary privilege in &quot;New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia (Speaker of the House of Assembly)&quot;. In that case, the Court made these observations about parliamentary privilege:

Recent cases of parliamentary privilege in Canada adjudicated by the courts include:
# 1993: &quot;New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia (Speaker of the House of Assembly)&quot;, where the courts held parliament could restrict who could enter the parliamentary precincts.
# 1999: &quot;Zundel v. Boudria, et al.&quot;, where the courts held parliament could restrict who could enter the parliamentary precincts.
# 2001: &quot;Ontario (Speaker of the Legislative Assembly) v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission)&quot;, where the courts held the actions of the provincial legislative assembly were immune from review by other government bodies including the Human Rights Commission.
# 2005: &quot;Canada (House of Commons) v. Vaid&quot;, where the Supreme Court of Canada analyzed the scope of parliamentary privilege and the role of courts in deciding its existence.

=== India ===
The government of India, based largely on the Westminster model, grants limited immunity from legal proceedings to members of Parliament and State Legislature under Articles 105 and 194 respectively, of the Indian Constitution. Article 105(2) reads as follows:
No member of Parliament shall be liable to any proceedings in any court in respect of anything said or any vote given by him in Parliament or any committee thereof, and no person shall be so liable in respect of the publication by or under the authority of either House of Parliament of any report, paper, votes or proceedings.

=== Ireland ===
In Ireland, as in other countries, members of the Oireachtas, Irish parliament, are granted privileges to perform their constitutional functions. These privileges are enshrined in Article 15 of the Constitution.

Freedom of speech is one of the most important and fundamental privileges enjoyed by Irish parliamentarians. Article 15.12 of the Constitution provides that — “All official reports and publications of the Oireachtas or of either House thereof and utterances made in either House wherever published shall be privileged”.

However, an Appendix to Article 15, Standing Order 59, places limits on freedom of speech with regards to potential defamation. It states:

(1) &quot;A member shall not make an utterance in the nature of being defamatory and where a member makes such an utterance it may be prima facie an abuse of privilege, subject to the provisions of this Standing Order.&quot;

The standing order further states that any utterance that is known to be defamatory must immediately be withdrawn. If the member of parliament does not withdraw the statement it is viewed as an act of disorder and may be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for review.

=== New Zealand ===
The New Zealand Parliament accords its members parliamentary privilege like its British counterpart, preventing members for being sued or prosecuted for anything that was said on the floor while in session.

=== Singapore ===
In Singapore, parliamentary privileges are statutorily accorded under the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act 1962. The Parliament of Singapore accords parliamentary privilege to its members, preventing them from being sued or prosecuted for anything said on the floor while parliament is in session, or during any parliamentary committee meetings.

=== South Africa ===
Parliamentary privilege has existed in South Africa since the first legislatures were established in the 1850s. Early laws on the subject included the Cape Colony&#x27;s Freedom of Speech in Parliament Act 1854, and Natal&#x27;s Law to Secure Freedom of Speech and Debates or Proceedings in the Legislative Council (1857) and Privileges of Parliament Act 1895.

The South Africa Act 1909, which established the Union of South Africa in 1910, provided that the Cape&#x27;s system of parliamentary privilege would apply to the Union&#x27;s parliament until such time as it made its own rules. This served as an interim measure until the Powers and Privileges of Parliament Act 1911 was passed. After the country became a republic in 1961, the Act was replaced with the Powers and Privileges of Parliament Act 1963, which, in turn, was replaced with the Powers, Privileges and Immunities of Parliament and Provincial Legislatures Act 2003.

The 1993 &#x27;interim&#x27; Constitution expressly protected members of the National Assembly and the Senate against civil or criminal action for anything which he or she said, produced, submitted or revealed in or before parliament or any of its committees, and gave similar protection to members of provincial legislatures. The 1996 Constitution contains similar provisions.

Helen Suzman used parliamentary privilege in her anti-apartheid campaigning. Helen Suzman reported during a 1994 interview that she was able to get around state of emergency rules applied against press reporting of violence in the country by asking questions in parliament about the subjects that the press were forbidden from talking about. South African legislation allowed anything said in parliament to be published in spite of emergency legislation. She commented on the hypocrisy of anti-apartheid campaigners criticising her for fighting apartheid from the inside in this way, yet publishing information revealed by her by means of parliamentary privilege.

=== United Kingdom ===

The ancient and undoubted rights and privileges of the Commons are claimed by the Speaker at the beginning of each new Parliament. The privileges are only codified in &quot;Erskine May: Parliamentary Practice&quot; and the House itself is the only judge of its own privileges. Most of those specifically claimed are practically obsolete, but others remain very real:

# Freedom of speech; (members speaking in the House are not liable for defamation)
# Freedom from arrest in civil matters (practically obsolete);
# Access of the Commons to the Crown (via the Speaker); and
# That &quot;the most favourable construction should be placed upon the deliberations of the Commons.&quot;

Privileges not specifically mentioned:

# Right of the House to regulate its own composition; (although election petitions are now determined by the ordinary Courts)
# Right of the House to regulate its own internal proceedings, both as to matters and procedures;
# Right to punish members and &quot;strangers&quot; for breach of privilege and contempt;
# Right of freedom from interference (although members are no longer immune from all civil actions)

==== Parliamentary papers ====
There is an absolute common law privilege for papers circulated among MPs by order of the House (&quot;Lake v. King&quot; (1667) 1 Saunders 131). This is extended to all papers published under the House&#x27;s authority, and to correct copies by the Parliamentary Papers Act 1840. The Act also extends qualified privilege to extracts.

==== Select committees ====
In addition to applying to members&#x27; speech within the chamber, parliamentary privilege also applies to select committees. Written and oral evidence given to, and published by these committees is also subject to the same absolute privilege as parliamentary papers. This means that any evidence given by a witness to a select committee may not be used against them or any other person in a court of law, whether for civil or criminal proceedings. This privilege only applies, however, if the committee has formally accepted it as evidence and does not apply to materials published before they were given to the committee.

===United States===
In the United States, the Speech or Debate Clause in Article One of the United States Constitution provides for a similar privilege, and many state constitutions provide similar clauses for their state legislatures.

== Leading cases ==
* Sir Thomas Haxey – free speech [1397]
* Richard Strode (Privilege of Parliament Act) [1512]
* George Ferrers – debt default [1542]
* &quot;Stockdale v. Hansard&quot; – defamation by &quot;Hansard&quot; [1839]
* Charles Bradlaugh – Oath of Allegiance [1880]
* Duncan Sandys – free speech [1938]
* Archibald Maule Ramsay – treason [1940]
* Garry Allighan – defamation [1947]
* Duncan Campbell (the Zircon affair) – free speech [1986]
* Neil Hamilton – cash for questions [1994]
* Bill Heffernan – free speech [2002]
* &quot;Superinjunction&quot; controversy:
** The Guardian–Trafigura affair – Right of the media to report proceedings covered by parliamentary privilege [2009]
** &quot;Fred Goodwin v News Group Newspapers Ltd and VBN&quot; and &quot;CTB v News Group Newspapers&quot; (Ryan Giggs) – Right of the media to report on anonymised court injunctions; parliamentary privilege used to allow the media to report the existence of injunctions and the parties involved [2011]
** An unnamed injunction in 2006 granted preventing participants of a case from speaking to individuals including &quot;Members of Parliament, journalists, lawyers&quot; on toxic chemicals in passenger ship water tanks and resulting illnesses – Right of constituents to speak to their MPs; existence revealed in a parliamentary question several years later. [2011]
* Ryan Giggs, a footballer, was suspected of committing adultery with Imogen Thomas, a Big Brother contestant, sought an injunction to prevent the media talking about the issue. He took legal action against Twitter, given that a Twitter user had named him among several celebrities as having taken out super-injunctions. Large numbers of people retweeted the comments and eventually, the Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming used parliamentary privilege to name Ryan Giggs. No prosecutions against Twitter users were pursued, firstly because of the impracticality of pursuing things and secondly because of the public outcry about celebrities using super-injunctions to evade accountability for sleazy behaviour.
* In the Republic of Ireland, Denis O&#x27;Brien lost a 2017 High Court case seeking to reprimand two TDs and RTÉ. After O&#x27;Brien had sought an injunction preventing RTÉ broadcasting his banking details, TDs Catherine Murphy and Pearse Doherty disclosed the details in Dáil Éireann speeches which were broadcast by RTÉ.

<doc id="738085" wikidata="Q24778533" url="?curid=738085" title="Angiotensin II receptor">
<text>The angiotensin II receptors, (ATR1) and (ATR2), are a class of G protein-coupled receptors with angiotensin II as their ligands. They are important in the renin–angiotensin system: they are responsible for the signal transduction of the vasoconstricting stimulus of the main effector hormone, angiotensin II.

== Structure ==
The AT1 and AT2 receptors share a sequence identity of ~30%, but have a similar affinity for angiotensin II, which is their main ligand.

==Members==

===Overview table===
===AT1=== 

The AT1 receptor is the best elucidated angiotensin receptor.

====Location within the body====
The AT1 subtype is found in the heart, blood vessels, kidney, adrenal cortex, lung and circumventricular organs of brain, basal ganglia, brainstem and mediates the vasoconstrictor effects.

====Mechanism====
The angiotensin receptor is activated by the vasoconstricting peptide angiotensin II. The activated receptor in turn couples to Gq/11 and Gi/o and thus activates phospholipase C and increases the cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations, which in turn triggers cellular responses such as stimulation of protein kinase C. Activated receptor also inhibits adenylate cyclase and activates various tyrosine kinases.

====Effects====
Effects mediated by the AT1 receptor include vasoconstriction, aldosterone synthesis and secretion, increased vasopressin secretion, cardiac hypertrophy, augmentation of peripheral noradrenergic activity, vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation, decreased renal blood flow, renal renin inhibition, renal tubular sodium reuptake, modulation of central sympathetic nervous system activity, cardiac contractility, central osmocontrol and extracellular matrix formation.

===AT2===
AT2 receptors are more plentiful in the fetus and neonate. The AT2 receptor remains enigmatic and controversial – is probably involved in vascular growth. Effects mediated by the AT2 receptor are suggested to include inhibition of cell growth, fetal tissue development, modulation of extracellular matrix, neuronal regeneration, apoptosis, cellular differentiation, and maybe vasodilation and left ventricular hypertrophy. In humans the AT2 subtype is found in molecular layer of the cerebellum. In the mouse is found in the adrenal gland, amygdaloid nuclei and, in small numbers, in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and the locus coeruleus.

===AT3 and AT4===
Other poorly characterized subtypes include the AT3 and AT4 receptors. The AT4 receptor is activated by the angiotensin II metabolite angiotensin IV, and may play a role in regulation of the CNS extracellular matrix, as well as modulation of oxytocin release.

This is a stony S-type asteroid with a diameter of and a sidereal rotation period of . It orbits in the same region of space as the Hygiea asteroid family, though it is actually an unrelated interloper. However, its geometric albedo of is too high, and it is of the wrong spectral class to be part of the dark carbonaceous Hygiea family. It is listed as a member of the Hecuba group of asteroids that orbit near the 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter.

Hekate was the 100th asteroid to be discovered, by Canadian-American astronomer J. C. Watson (his fourth discovery) on July 11, 1868. It is named after Hecate, the goddess of witchcraft in Greek mythology, but its name also commemorates it as the hundredth asteroid, as ἑκατόν (&quot;hekaton&quot;) is Greek for &#x27;hundred&#x27;.

A Hekatean occultation of a star was observed on July 14, 2003, from New Zealand.

<text>University College Cork – National University of Ireland, Cork (UCC) () is a constituent university of the National University of Ireland, and located in Cork.

The university was founded in 1845 as one of three Queen&#x27;s Colleges located in Belfast, Cork, and Galway. It became University College, Cork, under the Irish Universities Act 1908. The Universities Act 1997 renamed the university as National University of Ireland, Cork, and a Ministerial Order of 1998 renamed the university as University College Cork – National University of Ireland, Cork, though it continues to be almost universally known as University College Cork.

Amongst other rankings and awards, the university was named Irish University of the Year by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; on five occasions; most recently in 2017. In 2015, UCC was also named as top performing university by the European Commission funded U-Multirank system, based on obtaining the highest number of &quot;A&quot; scores (21 out of 28 metrics) among a field of 1200 partaking universities. UCC also became the first university to achieve the ISO 50001 standard in energy management in 2011.

==History==

Queen&#x27;s College, Cork, was founded by the provisions of an act which enabled Queen Victoria to endow new colleges for the &quot;Advancement of Learning in Ireland&quot;. Under the powers of this act, the three colleges of Belfast, Cork and Galway were incorporated on 30 December 1845. The college opened in 1849 with 23 professors and 181 students; Medicine, Arts, and Law were the three founding faculties. A year later the college became part of the Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland.

The original site chosen for the college was considered appropriate as it was believed to have had a connection with the patron saint of Cork, Saint Finbarr. His monastery and school of learning were close by at Gill Abbey Rock and the mill attached to the monastery is thought to have stood on the bank of the south channel of the River Lee, which runs through the college lower grounds. This association is also reflected in the college motto &quot;Where Finbarr Taught, Let Munster Learn&quot; which is also the university motto.

Adjacent to Gillabbey and overlooking the valley of the river Lee, the site was selected in 1846. The Tudor Gothic quadrangle and early campus buildings were designed and built by Sir Thomas Deane and Benjamin Woodward. Queen&#x27;s College Cork officially opened its doors in November 1849, with further buildings added later, including the Medical/Windle Building in the 1860s.

===National University of Ireland===
In the following century, the Irish Universities Act 1908 formed the National University of Ireland, consisting of the three constituent colleges of Dublin, Cork and Galway, and the college was given the status of a university college as &quot;University College, Cork&quot;. The Universities Act, 1997, made the university college a constituent university of the National University and made the constituent university a full university for all purposes except the awarding of degrees and diplomas which remains the sole remit of the National University.

==Today==

As of 2022, University College Cork (UCC) had 24,195 students. These included 16,849 in undergraduate programmes, 7,346 in postgraduate study and research, and 2,800 in adult continuing education across undergraduate, postgraduate and short courses. The student base is supported by 3429 academic, research and administrative staff. As of 2022, UCC reportedly has c. 200,000 alumni worldwide.

===Campus===
Student numbers, at over 24,000 in 2022, increased from the late 1980s, precipitating the expansion of the campus by the acquisition of adjacent buildings and lands. This expansion continued with the opening of the Alfred O&#x27;Rahilly building in the late 1990s, the Cavanagh Pharmacy building, the Brookfield Health Sciences centre, the extended &quot;Áras na MacLéinn&quot; (Devere Hall), the Lewis Glucksman Gallery in 2004, &quot;Experience UCC&quot; (Visitors&#x27; Centre) and an extension to the &quot;Boole Library&quot; – named for the first professor of mathematics at UCC, George Boole, who developed the algebra that would later make computer programming possible. The university also completed the Western Gateway Building in 2009 on the site of the former Cork Greyhound track on the Western Road as well as refurbishment to the Tyndall institute buildings at the Lee Maltings Complex. In 2016, UCC acquired the Cork Savings Bank building on Lapps Quay in the centre of Cork City. As of 2017, the university is rolling out a programme to increase the space across its campuses, with part of this development involving the creation of a &#x27;student hub&#x27; to support academic strategy, add 600 new student accommodation spaces, and develop an outdoor sports facility. 

The School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences is based on the North Mall Campus, the site of the former North Mall Distillery.

Since 1986, 2.5 tonnes of uranium rods had been stored in the basement of the UCC physics department, for use in a sub critical assembly (SCA) for research and training purposes. The uranium was originally given to Ireland by the US as part of the Atoms for Peace programme, however, due to public opposition, the reactor was disassembled during the 1980s. As there is no nuclear waste site in Ireland, the uranium remained on campus, with the last update on its status from then-Minister for Education Ruari Quinn being that it was securely stored in a radioactive waste store until it could be permanently relocated off-campus.

In 2006, the university re-opened the Crawford Observatory, a structure built in 1880 on the grounds of the university by Sir Howard Grubb. Grubb, son of the Grubb telescope building family in Dublin, designed the observatory and built the astronomical instruments for the structure. The university paid for an extensive restoration and conservation of the building and the three main telescopes, the Equatorial, the Transit Circle and Sidereostatic telescopes.

In November 2009, several UCC buildings were damaged by flooding. The floods also affected other parts of Cork City, with many students being evacuated from accommodation. The college authorities postponed academic activities for a week, and indicated that it would take until 2010 before all flood-damaged property would be repaired. Particularly impacted was the newly opened Western Gateway Building, with the main lecture theatre requiring a total refit just months after opening for classes.

In 2018, UCC&#x27;s campus became home to the first &quot;plastic free&quot; café in Ireland, with the opening of the Bio Green Café in the Biosciences building.

===Research===
The university is one of Ireland&#x27;s leading research institutes, with among the highest research income in the state. In 2016, UCC secured research funding of over €96 million, a 21% increase over five years and a high for the university. The university had seven faculties: Arts and Celtic Studies, Commerce, Engineering, Food Science and Technology, Law, Medicine, and Science. Between 2005 and 2006 the university was restructured from these seven faculties into four colleges: Arts, Celtic Studies and Social Science; Business and Law; Medicine and Health; and Science, Engineering and Food Science.

According to the 2009-2012 UCC Strategic Plan, UCC aimed to enhance research and innovation. In 2009, the university was ranked in the top 3% of universities worldwide for research.

UCC&#x27;s published research strategy proposed to create &quot;Centres of Excellence&quot; for &quot;world-class research&quot; in which the researchers and research teams would be given &quot;freedom and flexibility to pursue their areas of research&quot;. Research centres in UCC cover a range of areas including: Nanoelectronics with the Tyndall Institute; Food and Health with the Alimentary Pharmabiotic Centre, NutraMara, Food for Health Ireland Research Centre, and Cereal Science Cork; the Environment with the Environmental Research Institute (with research in biodiversity, aquaculture, energy efficiency and ocean energy); and Business Information Systems.

The &quot;Sunday Times&quot; &quot;Good University Guide 2015&quot;, put UCC at the top of their rankings for &quot;research income per academic&quot;.

In October 2008, the governing body of the university announced that UCC would be the first institution in Ireland to use embryonic stem cells in research under strict guidelines of the University Research Ethics using imported hESCs from approved jurisdictions. In 2009, Professor of Mathematics at UCC, Des McHale, challenged the university&#x27;s decision to allow embryonic stem cell research. According to the results of a poll conducted by irishhealth.com, almost two in three people supported the decision made by University College Cork to allow embryonic stem cell research.

In 2016, Professor Noel Caplice, director of the centre for research in Vascular Biology at UCC and a cardiologist at Cork University Hospital, announced a &quot;major breakthrough in the field of blood vessel replacement&quot;.

===Campus companies===
The university has a number of related companies including: Cytrea, which is involved in pharmaceutical formulations; Firecomms, an ICT company concentrating on optical communications; Alimentary Health a biotech healthcare company; Biosensia who develop integrated micro-system analytical chips; Sensl, part of ON Semiconductor; Luxcel which is involved in the development of probes and sensors; and Optical Metrology Innovations which develops laser metrology systems.

===Knowledge transfer===
Innovation and Knowledge transfer is driven by UCC&#x27;s Office of Technology Transfer, an office of the university dedicated to commercialising aspects of UCC&#x27;s research and connecting researchers with industry. Recent spinouts from the college include pharmaceutical company Glantreo, Luxcel Biosciences, Alimentary Health, Biosensia, Firecoms, Gourmet Marine, Keelvar, Lee Oncology, and Sensl.

===Commemorative events===
In 2015, the university marked the bicentenary of mathematician, philosopher and logician George Boole - UCC&#x27;s first professor of mathematics. In September 2017, UCC unveiled a €350 million investment plan, with university president, Professor Patrick O’Shea, outlining the development goals for UCC in the areas of philanthropy and student recruitment. The plan proposes to provide for curriculum development, an increase in national and international student numbers, the extension of the campus and an increase in the income earned from philanthropy.

The Minister for Culture, Heritage &amp; the Gaeltacht and Chair of the National Famine Commemoration Committee, Heather Humphreys TD, also announced that 2018&#x27;s National Famine Commemoration is planned to take place in UCC. Cork University Press published The Atlas of the Great Irish Famine in 2012. Subsequently, in September 2017, The Atlas of the Irish Revolution was published by Cork University Press. In November 2017, UCC&#x27;s MSc Information Systems for Business Performance (ISBP) was named &quot;Postgraduate Course of the Year - IT&quot; at the gradireland Higher Education Awards in Dublin.

===Reputation===

University College Cork has been ranked by a number of bodies, and was named as the &quot;Irish University of the Year&quot; by the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; in 2003, 2005, 2011 and 2016, and was a runner up in the 2015 edition. In 2015, UCC was also named as top performing university by the European Commission funded U-Multirank system, based on a high number of &quot;A&quot; scores (21 out of 28 metrics) among a field of 1200 partaking universities. Also in 2015, the CWTS Leiden Ranking placed UCC 1st in Ireland, 16th in Europe and 52nd globally from a field of 750 universities. The 2011 QS World University Rankings assigned a 5-star rating to UCC, and ranked the university amongst the top 2% of universities worldwide. UCC was ranked 230th in the 2014 edition of the QS World University Rankings. 13 of its subject areas featured in the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2015 (up from 10 subject areas in 2014), including the Pharmacy &amp; Pharmacology disciplines, which were listed with the top 50 worldwide. 
The Universitas Indonesia (UI) Greenmetric World University Ranking awarded UCC a second in the world ranking for the second year in a row in 2015 for its efforts in the area of sustainability, with 360 universities from 62 countries ranked overall.

UCC has been recognised for its digital and social media presence, winning the &#x27;Best Social Media Engagement&#x27; category at the 2014 Social Media Awards, and as a finalist in two categories at the 2015 Social Media Awards. A previous finalist at the 2013 and 2014 Web Awards, UCC also made the 2015 finals in two categories, &#x27;Most Influential Irish Website Ever&#x27; and &#x27;Best Education and Third Level Website&#x27;. University College Cork had the first website in Ireland in 1991 (only the ninth website in the world at the time), serving transcriptions of Irish historical and literary documents for the CELT project converted from SGML to HTML.

It was reported in December 2020 that UCC had spent €76,265.38 investigating sexual harassment claims over the previous five years. This represented the largest amount spent by a third-level institution in Ireland during that period. UCC spent €24,460.50 on legal fees in the years 2017 and 2018, and paid out €510 in 2018.

==Academic units==
===College of Medicine and Health===
Medicine, Arts, and Law were the three founding faculties when Queen&#x27;s College Cork opened its doors to students in 1849. The medical buildings were built in stages between 1860 and 1880, and the faculty quickly gained a reputation for the quality of its graduates. The first two women to graduate in medicine in Ireland did so in 1898 (this was notable as it was more than 20 years before women were permitted to sit for medicine at the University of Oxford). UCC School of Medicine is part of the College of Medicine and Health, and is based at the Brookfield Health Sciences Centre on the main UCC campus and is affiliated with the 1000-bed University College Cork Teaching Hospital, which is the largest medical centre in Ireland. The UCC School Of Pharmacy is based in the Cavanagh Pharmacy Building.

===Centre for Architectural Education===
The Cork Centre for Architectural Education (CCAE) is the Department of Architecture at UCC, and is a school jointly run with Munster Technological University. It is accredited by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland.

===Humanities===
The College of Arts, Celtic Studies and Social Sciences (CACSSS) incorporates a number of schools.

UCC is home to the Irish Institute of Chinese Studies, which allows students to study Chinese culture as well as the language through Arts and Commerce. The department won the European Award for Languages in 2008.

As of 2017, Digital Humanities had grown as a discipline, with 26 PhD research students working on various Digital Humanities projects. UCC&#x27;s programme for students in Digital Humanities includes BA (Hons) Digital Humanities &amp; Information Technology, MA Digital Arts &amp; Humanities and PhD Digital Arts &amp; Humanities.

==Student life==
===Clubs, societies and representation===
University College Cork has over 100 active societies and 50 different sports clubs. There are academic, charitable, creative, gaming/role-playing, political, religious, and social societies and clubs incorporating field sports, martial arts, watersports as well outdoor and indoor team and individual sports. UCC clubs are sponsored by Bank of Ireland, with the UCC Skull and Crossbones as the mascot for all UCC sports teams. 100 students received scholarships in 26 different sports in 2010.

The activities of UCC&#x27;s societies include charity work; with over €100,000 raised annually by the Surgeon Noonan society, €10,000 raised by the War Gaming and Role Playing Society (WARPS) through its international gaming convention Warpcon, €10,000 raised by the UCC Law Society for the Cambodia orphanage and the UCC Pharmacy Society supports the Cork Hospitals Children&#x27;s Club every year with a number of events. UCC societies also sometimes attract high-profile speakers such as Robert Fisk who addressed the Law Society, Nick Leeson, and Senator David Norris, who was the 2009/2010 honorary president of the UCC Philosophical Society.

&quot;An Chuallacht&quot; (, meaning &quot;the fellowship&quot;) is UCC&#x27;s Irish language and culture society. Founded in 1912, this society promotes the Irish language, and was awarded the Glór na nGael &quot;Irish Society of the Year Award&quot; in 2009.

The UCC Students&#x27; Union (UCCSU) acts as the representative body of the 17,000 students attending UCC. Each student is automatically a member by virtue of a student levy. The student-run radio station, &quot;UCC 98.3FM&quot;, broadcasts on the campus.

===Student accommodation===
Accommodation for students is offered by UCC through a subsidiary company known as Campus Accommodation UCC DAC. UCC operate 5 accommodation complexes, including the Castlewhite Apartments (63 apartments/298 beds), Mardyke Hall (14 apartments/48 beds),

In February 2020, UCC announced their decision to raise rent in the 2020/21 academic term by three-percent over the 2019/20 academic term rate. The announcement came after similar rent increases in university-owned accommodation throughout the country, and after increases in previous years to the rent of UCC-owned accommodation. This decision was met with backlash from student representatives, UCC staff, and local politicians. On 25 February 2020, the UCC Students&#x27; Union launched a campaign which demanded that UCC reverse the increase. A group of over 300 UCC staff members signed a petition in solidarity with the Students&#x27; Union. Several members of Cork County Council also expressed opposition to the decision. In early March 2020, a spokesperson for the university said the increase was necessary due to refurbishment works, and a rise in security and maintenance costs.

===International students===
The largest number of the 2,400 international students at UCC in 2010 came from the United States, followed by China, France and Malaysia. UCC participates in the Erasmus program with 439 students visiting UCC in 2009–2010. 201 UCC students studied in institutions in the United States, China and Europe in the same period.

UCC was rated highly in the 2008 International Student Barometer report. This survey polled 67,000 international students studying at 84 institutions, and was carried out by the International Insight Group. The report held that 98% of UCC&#x27;s international students (who participated in the survey) reported having &quot;Expert Lecturers&quot;. And over 90% of these students said that they had &quot;Good Teachers&quot;. In 3 categories of the survey, &quot;sports facilities&quot;, &quot;social facilities&quot; and &quot;university clubs and societies&quot;, UCC was in the top three of the 84 Institutions that took part in the survey. UCC&#x27;s International Education Office was given a 93% satisfaction rating and UCC&#x27;s IT Support was given a 92% satisfaction rating.

In 2023, whilst studying there, Diana Vicezar launched a podcast covering the experiences of Hispanic and Latin-American students in Ireland.

<text>Antero Tarquínio de Quental (; old spelling &quot;Anthero&quot;; 18 April 184211 September 1891) was a Portuguese poet, philosopher, and writer. Quental is regarded as one of the greatest poets of his generation and is recognized as one of the most influential Portuguese language artists of all time. His name is often mentioned alongside Luís Vaz de Camões, Manuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage, and Fernando Pessoa.

==Biography==

===Early life and childhood===
Antero de Quental was born in Ponta Delgada on the island of São Miguel in the Azores. His family was among the oldest families of the provincial captaincy system. His father was Fernando de Quental (10 May 18147 March 1873), a veteran of the Portuguese Liberal Wars, who took part in the Landing of Mindelo. Antero&#x27;s mother was Ana Guilhermina da Maia (16 July 181128 November 1876), a devout relative of Fr. Bartolomeu de Quental, founder of the Congregation of the Oratory in Portugal.

Quental began to write poetry at an early age, chiefly, though not entirely, devoting himself to the sonnet. As a child, he took French lessons under António Feliciano de Castilho, a leading figure of the Portuguese Romantic movement, who resided in Ponta Delgada. Despite their relationship, Quental would later criticize Castilho and other Romantic poets, sparking a divisive conflict. Quental was seven when he was enrolled at Liçeu Açoriano, a private school where he received English lessons from Mr. Rendall, a renowned prospector on the island. In August 1852, Quental moved with his mother to Lisbon, where he studied at Colégio do Pórtico, whose headmaster was his old tutor Castilho. When the institution closed, Quental returned to Ponta Delgada in 1853. On writing to his old headmaster, he said:
Throughout the latter part of his life, Quental dedicated his studies to poetry, politics, and philosophy. By 1855, at the age of 16, he had returned to Lisbon, then went to Coimbra where he graduated from the Colégio de São Bento in 1857.

In the fall of 1856, he enrolled at the University of Coimbra, where he studied law and adopted socialist ideas.

He soon distinguished himself for his oral and written talents, as well as for his turbulent and eccentric nature. While in Coimbra, he founded the Sociedade do Raio, which aimed at promoting literature to the masses, and made blasphemous challenges to religion.

In 1861, Quental published his first sonnets. Four years later, he published &quot;Odes Modernas&quot;, influenced by the Socialist Experimentalism of Proudhon, which championed intellectual revolution. During that year, a conflict (which would later be known as &quot;Questão Coimbrã&quot;) developed between the traditionalist poets and the younger students. The old guard was championed by António Feliciano de Castilho (at that time the chief living poet of the elder generation). The group of students included Quental, Teófilo Braga, Viera de Castro, Ramalho Ortigão, Guerra Junqueiro, Eça de Queiros, Oliveira Martins, Jaime Batalha Reis and Guilherme de Azevedo, among others. Castilho accused this student group of poetic exhibitionism, obscurity, and generally a lack of good sense and taste. In response, Quental published &quot;Bom Senso e Bom Gosto&quot;, &quot;A Dignidade das Letras&quot;, and &quot;Literaturas Oficiais&quot; in which he defended their independence. Quental pointed to the mission of poets in an era of great transformation (the necessity to be messengers of the day&#x27;s great ideological questions) and also criticized Castilho&#x27;s style of poetry, labeling it ridiculous and trivial. This gave rise to the 1865 controversy known as the &quot;Questão Coimbrã&quot; (&quot;Coimbra Question&quot;). Quental&#x27;s group became known as the 70s Generation, but the ultra-romantic group of António Feliciano de Castilho did not receive a label.

===Unquiet maturity===
Following this controversy, Quental traveled, engaged in political and socialist agitation, and found his way through a series of disappointments, eventually embracing a mild form of pessimism. Paradoxically, this new attitude animated his poetry and gave him new, albeit darker philosophical material. In 1866, he went to live in Lisbon, where he experimented with proletarianism and worked as a typographer at the National Press, a job that he also continued in Paris (where he went to support the French workers), between January and February 1867.

He briefly went to the United States but returned to Lisbon in 1868. In Lisbon, along with Eça de Queirós, Guerra Junqueiro, and Ramalho Ortigão, he formed &quot;Cenáculo&quot;, an intellectual group of anarchists against many of the political, social, and intellectual conventions of the day.

In 1869, Quental founded the newspaper &quot;A República - Jornal da Democracia Portuguesa&quot; with Oliveira Martins, and in 1872, along with José Fontana, began to edit the magazine &quot;O Pensamento Social&quot;. In 1871, the year of the Paris Commune, Quental organized the famous &quot;Conferências do Casino&quot; (), which marked the beginning of the spread of Socialist and Anarchist ideas in Portugal; in this Quental distinguished himself as a crusader for republican ideals. He presented himself on two occasions (1879 and 1881) as a candidate for the Partido Socialista Português (Portuguese Socialist Party).

In 1873, Quental inherited a sizable amount of money, which allowed him to live in reasonable comfort. Owing to tuberculosis the following year, he rested but returned to re-edit his &quot;Odes Modernas&quot;. He moved to Oporto, Portugal in 1879, and in 1886 published arguably his best poetic work, &quot;Sonetos Completos&quot;, which included many passages considered autobiographical and symbolic .

In 1880, he adopted the two daughters of his friend, Germano Meireles, who had died in 1877. During a trip to Paris, Quental became seriously ill, and in September 1881, under counsel from his doctor, Quental began residing in Vila do Conde, where he remained until May 1891 (with a few intervals in the Azores and Lisbon). He regarded his time in Vila do Conde as the best of his life. To Carolina Michaelis de Vasconcelos, a friend, he wrote of his need to end his poetry and begin a philosophical phase in his writing, to develop and synthesize his philosophy.

In reaction to the English Ultimatum, on 11 January 1890, Quental agreed to preside over the minor &quot;Liga Patriótica do Norte&quot; (), although his involvement was short-lived. When he eventually returned to Lisbon, he stayed at the home of his sister, Ana de Quental.

Throughout his life, Quental oscillated between pessimism and depression; afflicted with what might have been bipolar disorder, at the time of his last trip to Lisbon, he was in a state of steady depression, compounded by spinal disease. After a month in Lisbon, he returned once again to Ponta Delgada around June 1891. On September 11 that year, at about 8:00 PM, he committed suicide by two gunshots to the stomach while seated on a bench in a local garden park. He died approximately an hour later. &quot;Of all things, the worst is having been born,&quot; he wrote in a poem.

==Works==
According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition:

His friend Oliveira Martins edited the Sonnets (Oporto, 1886), supplying an introductory essay. An interesting collection of studies on the poet by the leading Portuguese writers appeared in a volume entitled &quot;Anthero de Quental. In Memoriam&quot; (Oporto, 1896). The sonnets have been translated into many languages; into English by Edgar Prestage (Anthero de Quental, Sixty-four Sonnets, London, 1894), together with a striking autobiographical letter addressed by Quental to his German translator, Dr. Storck.

<doc id="738130" wikidata="Q623465" url="?curid=738130" title="Wasatch Front">
<text>The Wasatch Front is a major metropolitan region in the north-central part of the U.S. state of Utah. It consists of a chain of mostly contiguous cities and towns stretched along the Wasatch Range from Santaquin in the south to Pleasant View in the north, and containing the cities of Salt Lake City, Provo, Orem, Bountiful, Layton, and Ogden.

== Geography ==
The Wasatch Front is long and narrow. To the east, the Wasatch Mountains rise abruptly several thousand feet above the valley floors, climbing to their highest elevation of at Mount Nebo (bordering southern Utah Valley). The area&#x27;s western boundary is formed by Utah Lake in Utah County, the Oquirrh Mountains in Salt Lake County, and the Great Salt Lake in northwestern Salt Lake, Davis, Weber, and southeastern Box Elder county.

Though most residents of the area live between Ogden and Provo (a distance of ), which includes Salt Lake City proper, the fullest built-out extent of the Wasatch Front is long and on average wide. Along its length, the Wasatch Front never exceeds a width of approximately because of the natural barriers of lakes and mountains.

Sustained drought in Utah has more recently strained the region&#x27;s water security, causing the Great Salt Lake to drop to record low levels, and affecting the state’s economy, of which the Wasatch Front constitutes 80%.

== Climate ==
The Wasatch Front is a semi-arid region at the eastern edge of the Great Basin. The urban corridor mainly lies in zone 7 with minimum average winter temperatures ranging between and daytime high temperatures ranging from the mid-30 °F to mid-40 °F range (-1 and 4 °C). Snowfall is common during winter but often melts rapidly. Inversions commonly occur along the Wasatch Front during mid-winter making for very cold temperatures and gloomy conditions lasting for several weeks at times in the valleys, while the higher mountain elevations will experience clear and warmer conditions. Localized lake-effect snowfall from the Great Salt Lake is common in the late Fall and early winter. The first freeze usually occurs in early October in the outlying areas but can occur as late as early November in the inner urban areas. The last freeze can occur broadly between early April and late May.

Summers are generally hot and dry, with the exception of the summer thunderstorm seasonal pattern which usually runs from early July through early September, when often intense thunderstorms occur due to mid-latitude weather patterns including the Pacific storm track. Daytime high temperatures are around , with higher temperatures often created by the urban heat island effect.

== Population centers ==

Several downtown and commercial districts encompass the Wasatch Front, including the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, the Provo-Orem metropolitan area (south of Salt Lake), and the Ogden-Clearfield metropolitan area (north of Salt Lake). Nearly all of the cities within the region are connected by continuous suburban development.

== Transportation ==

Ogden has served as a major railway hub through much of its history. The First transcontinental railroad was constructed between 1863 and 1869, with the tracks reaching Ogden on March 27, 1869. Trains heading east from Ogden must negotiate the highest reaches of eastern Utah, travelling through Weber and Echo Canyons and over the Wasatch Pass at an elevation of 6,792 feet.

Union Pacific has operated the world&#x27;s most powerful locomotives to haul freight over the Wasatch Mountains between Cheyenne and Ogden, including American Locomotive Company&#x27;s famous &quot;Big Boys&quot;, the world&#x27;s largest steam locomotive; GE&#x27;s Gas Turbines known as the &quot;Big Blows&quot; (because of their distinctive sound), the world&#x27;s most powerful internal combustion locomotive; and GM&#x27;s &quot;Big Jacks&quot;, the most powerful single-unit diesel locomotive type ever built.

Transportation issues within the metropolitan area have been complicated by the narrow north–south orientation of the valley, constrained by the natural barriers on both sides, and the rapid growth of the region.

The primary modes of transport for the area are Interstate 15 (I‑15) and U.S. Route 89 (US‑89), both of which run down its center from north to south for the full length of about . Other interstates and highways provide transportation routes to local areas within the Wasatch Front. Such transportation routes include Interstate 84 in the Ogden area; the Legacy Parkway (State Route 67) running north–south through western Davis County; Interstate 80 running east–west through Salt Lake City; Interstate 215 (I‑215) circling the inner Salt Lake Valley; the Mountain View Corridor (State Route 85), Bangerter Highway (State Route 154), and State Route 201 to the west of Salt Lake City; U.S. Route 189 through Provo, and U.S. Route 6 in southern Utah County.

The Utah Transit Authority provides bus and light rail (TRAX) service to most of the urban areas within the Wasatch Front. Additionally, a double-decker commuter rail line &quot;FrontRunner&quot;, running from North Ogden to Provo, is in full operation.

The &quot;California Zephyr&quot; of Amtrak is the primary rail transport leading in and out of the Wasatch Front, having a station in Salt Lake City and Provo.

Salt Lake City International Airport serves as the primary airport for the region. Ogden-Hinckley Airport and Provo Municipal Airport also provide scheduled commercial air service.

== Growth and land use ==
Because of the geographical barriers to the east and west, much of the land along the Wasatch Front has been developed. The region has experienced considerable growth since the 1950s, with its population increasing 308% from 492,374 to 2,051,330. Much of the remaining undeveloped land is rapidly being developed, and local governments have grappled with problems of urban sprawl and other land-use concerns.

The region on the other side of the Wasatch Range, including cities such as Park City, Morgan, Heber City, and Midway, is sometimes referred to as the Wasatch Back and has recently shared in the rapid growth of the region.

<text>Jan Hendrik Wolkers (26 October 1925 – 19 October 2007) was a Dutch author, sculptor and painter. Wolkers is considered by some to be one of the &quot;Great Four&quot; writers of post-World War II Dutch literature, alongside Willem Frederik Hermans, Harry Mulisch and Gerard Reve (the latter authors are also known as the &quot;Great Three&quot;).

Wolkers was born in Oegstgeest. He became noted as an author in the 1960s mainly for his graphic descriptions of sexual acts, which were often subject of controversy. His 1969 novel &quot;Turks Fruit&quot; was translated into ten languages and published in English as &quot;Turkish Delight&quot;. It was also made into a highly successful movie, the Paul Verhoeven-directed &quot;Turks Fruit&quot; (1972) which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and in 1999 won the award for Best Dutch Film of the Century.

Wolkers declined several literary awards. In 1982 he refused the Constantijn Huygensprijs, and in 1989 he refused the P.C. Hooftprijs.

From 1980 until his death, Wolkers resided on the Dutch island of Texel. He died on 19 October 2007, aged 81, at his Texel home and was cremated in Amsterdam at De Nieuwe Ooster cemetery.

A number of his outdoor sculptures in the Netherlands have been subject to vandalism, presumably due to his use of glass as a construction material. Some examples are the Auschwitz monument in Amsterdam and the monument on the dike at Ceres on Texel. In reaction to the destruction of the monument in 2003, Wolkers announced that he would use less glass and more steel for such monuments in future. The Jac. P. Thijsse monument on Texel does contain more steel, but glass is still a substantial part of the artwork.

Since 2019, the private and literary archive of Jan Wolkers has been available at Leiden University Library.

<text>The West Wing of the White House houses the formal office for the president of the United States. The West Wing contains the Oval Office, the Cabinet Room, the Situation Room, and the Roosevelt Room.

The West Wing&#x27;s three floors contain offices for the vice president, White House chief of staff, the counselor to the president, the senior advisor to the president, the White House press secretary, and their support staffs. Adjoining the press secretary&#x27;s office, in the colonnade between the West Wing and the Executive Residence, is the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, along with workspace for the White House press corps.

==History==
Before the construction of the West Wing, presidential staff worked on the western end of the second floor of what is now the Executive Residence. However, when Theodore Roosevelt became president, he found that the existing offices in the mansion were insufficient to accommodate his family of six children as well as his staff.

A year later, in 1902, First Lady Edith Roosevelt hired McKim, Mead &amp; White to separate the living quarters from the offices, to enlarge and modernize the public rooms, to re-do the landscaping, and to redecorate the interior. Congress approved over half a million dollars for the renovation.

The West Wing was originally intended as a temporary office structure, built on the site of the extensive greenhouses and stables. The President&#x27;s Office and the Cabinet Room took up the eastern third of the building closest to the Residence and attached colonnaded terrace. Roosevelt&#x27;s rectangular office with adjacent Cabinet Room through a set of double doors which was located approximately where the Roosevelt Room is now near the centre.

In 1909, William Howard Taft expanded the building southward, covering the tennis court. He placed the first Oval Office at the center of the addition&#x27;s south facade, reminiscent of the oval rooms on the three floors of the White House. Later, at the outset of his presidency, Herbert Hoover rebuilt the West Wing, excavating a partial basement, and supporting it with structural steel. The completed building, however, lasted less than seven months. On December 24, 1929, the West Wing was significantly damaged by an electrical fire. This four-alarm fire was the most destructive to strike the White House since the Burning of Washington 115 years earlier. One hundred and thirty firefighters, over nineteen engine companies, and four truck companies were needed to extinguish the blaze. Caused either by a faulty or blocked chimney flue or defective wiring, the fire began in the attic of the building where an estimated 200,000 government pamphlets were stored. These papers quickly ignited. Many of the important documents in the area were recently moved to the Library of Congress following a minor remodel of the building. The fire was noticed at approximately 8:00 pm by White House messenger Charlie Williamson, and immediate action was taken to save items in the building. Hoover had the West Wing rebuilt, and added air-conditioning.

The fourth and final major reorganization was undertaken less than three years later by Franklin D. Roosevelt. Dissatisfied with the size and layout of President Hoover&#x27;s West Wing, he engaged New York architect Eric Gugler to redesign it in 1933. To create additional space without increasing the apparent size of the building, Gugler excavated a full basement, added a set of subterranean offices under the adjacent lawn, and built an unobtrusive &quot;penthouse&quot; story. The directive to wring the most office space out of the existing building was responsible for its narrow corridors and cramped staff offices. Gugler&#x27;s most notable change was the addition to the east side containing a new Cabinet Room, Secretary&#x27;s Office, and Oval Office. The new office&#x27;s location gave presidents greater privacy, allowing them to slip back and forth between the Executive Residence and the West Wing without being in full view of the staff.

As the size of the president&#x27;s staff grew over the latter half of the 20th century, the West Wing generally came to be seen as too small for its modern governmental functions. Today, most of the staff members of the Executive Office of the President are located in the adjacent Eisenhower Executive Office Building.

==First floor==
===Oval Office===
===Cabinet Room===
===Roosevelt Room===

Richard Nixon also renamed the room, previously called by Franklin Roosevelt the &quot;Fish Room&quot; (where he kept aquariums, and where John F. Kennedy displayed trophy fish), in honour of the two presidents Roosevelt: Theodore, who first built the West Wing, and Franklin, who built the current Oval Office. By tradition, a portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt hangs over the mantel of the Roosevelt Room during the administration of a president from the Democratic Party and a portrait of Theodore Roosevelt hangs during the administration of a Republican president (although Bill Clinton chose to retain the portrait of Theodore Roosevelt above the mantel). In the past, the portrait not hanging over the mantel hung on the opposite wall. However, during the first term of George W. Bush, an audio-visual cabinet was placed on the opposite wall providing secure audio and visual conference capabilities across the hall from the Oval Office.

===Press Briefing Room===

During the 1930s, the March of Dimes constructed a swimming pool so that Franklin Roosevelt could exercise, as therapy for his polio-related disability. Richard Nixon had the swimming pool covered over to create the Press Briefing Room, where the White House Press Secretary gives daily briefings.

===White House press corps===

The journalists, correspondents, and others who are part of the White House press corps have offices near the press briefing room.

==Ground floor==
===Situation Room===
===White House Mess===
The West Wing ground floor is also the site of a small restaurant operated by the Presidential Food Service and staffed by Naval culinary specialists and called the White House Mess. It is located underneath the Oval Office, and was established by President Truman on June 11, 1951.


==Second floor==

==Depiction on &quot;The West Wing&quot; TV series==

In 1999, &quot;The West Wing&quot; television series brought greater public attention to the workings of the presidential staff, as well as to the location of those working in the West Wing. The show followed the working lives of a fictional Democratic U.S. president, Josiah Bartlet, and his senior staff. When asked whether the show accurately captured the working environment in 2003, Press Secretary Scott McClellan commented that the show portrayed more foot traffic and larger rooms than in the real West Wing.

<text>Willie Smith (25 January 1886 – 2 June 1982) was an English professional player of snooker and English billiards. Smith was, according to an article on the English Amateur Billiards Association&#x27;s website, &quot;by common consent, the greatest all-round billiards player who ever lived&quot;.

He studied previous Billiard players such as Melbourne Inman, Harry Stevenson, Tom Reece, Edward Diggle and George Gray, describing his play as &quot;the combination of Gray&#x27;s striking and Diggle&#x27;s top-of-the-table play&quot;. Smith became a professional player in 1913.

He entered the World Billiards Championship in 1920 and then again in 1923, winning it on both occasions. Arguments with the governing body prevented him from taking part in the competition more often.

In 1930 he started writing for &quot;The Burwat Billiard Review&quot;, a magazine published by the Cue Sport Manufacturers Burroughes and Watts. These were instructional articles with accompanying illustrations and photographs.

He turned to snooker for purely monetary reasons but never really took to the game. His natural talent as a billiards player still enabled him to reach the World Snooker Championship final in 1933 and 1935 where he was beaten by Joe Davis.

<text>The Kármán line (or von Kármán line ) is a conventional definition of the edge of space; it is widely but not universally accepted. The international record-keeping body FAI (Fédération aéronautique internationale) defines the Kármán line at an altitude of above mean sea level. 

While named after Theodore von Kármán, who calculated a theoretical limit of altitude for aeroplane flight at above Earth, the later established Kármán line is more general and has no distinct physical significance, in that there is a rather gradual difference between the characteristics of the atmosphere at the line, and experts disagree on defining a distinct boundary where the atmosphere ends and space begins. It lies well above the altitude reachable by conventional aeroplanes or high-altitude balloons, and is approximately where satellites, even on very eccentric trajectories, will decay before completing a single orbit.

The Kármán line is mainly used for legal and regulatory purposes of differentiating between aircraft and spacecraft, which are then subject to different jurisdictions and legislations. While international law does not define the edge of space, or the limit of national airspace, most international organizations and regulatory agencies (including the United Nations) accept the FAI&#x27;s Kármán line definition or something close to it. As defined by the FAI, the Kármán line was established in the 1960s. Various countries and entities define space&#x27;s boundary differently for various purposes.

== Definition ==
The FAI uses the term Kármán line to define the boundary between aeronautics and astronautics:

== Interpretations of the definition ==
The expressions &quot;edge of space&quot; or &quot;near space&quot; are often used (by, for instance, the FAI in some of their publications) to refer to a region below the boundary of Outer Space, which is often meant to include substantially lower regions as well. Thus, certain balloon or airplane flights might be described as &quot;reaching the edge of space&quot;. In such statements, &quot;reaching the edge of space&quot; merely refers to going higher than average aeronautical vehicles commonly would.

There is still no international legal definition of the demarcation between a country&#x27;s air space and outer space. In 1963, Andrew G. Haley discussed the Kármán line in his book &quot;Space Law and Government&quot;. In a chapter on the limits of national sovereignty, he made a survey of major writers&#x27; opinions. He indicated the inherent imprecision of the Line:

The line represents a mean or median measurement. It is comparable to such measures used in the law as mean sea level, meander line, tide line; but it is more complex than these. In arriving at the von Kármán jurisdictional line, myriad factors must be considered – other than the factor of aerodynamic lift. These factors have been discussed in a very large body of literature and by a score or more of commentators. They include the physical constitution of the air; the biological and physiological viability; and still other factors which logically join to establish a point at which air no longer exists and at which airspace ends.
== Kármán&#x27;s comments ==
In the final chapter of his autobiography, Kármán addresses the issue of the edge of outer space:

Where space begins ... can actually be determined by the speed of the space vehicle and its altitude above the Earth. Consider, for instance, the record flight of Captain Iven Carl Kincheloe Jr. in an X-2 rocket plane. Kincheloe flew 2000 miles per hour (3,200 km/h) at 126,000 feet (38,500 m), or 24 miles up. At this altitude and speed, aerodynamic lift still carries 98 percent of the weight of the plane, and only two percent is carried by inertia, or Kepler force, as space scientists call it. But at 300,000 feet (91,440 m) or 57 miles up, this relationship is reversed because there is no longer any air to contribute lift: only inertia prevails. This is certainly a physical boundary, where aerodynamics stops and astronautics begins, and so I thought why should it not also be a jurisdictional boundary? Andrew G. Haley has termed it the Kármán Jurisdictional Line. Below this line, space belongs to each country. Above this level there would be free space.

== Technical considerations ==
An atmosphere does not abruptly end at any given height but becomes progressively less dense with altitude. Also, depending on how the various layers that make up the space around the Earth are defined (and depending on whether these layers are considered part of the actual atmosphere), the definition of the edge of space could vary considerably: If one were to consider the thermosphere and exosphere part of the atmosphere and not of space, one might have to extend the boundary of space to at least above sea level. The Kármán line thus is a largely arbitrary definition based on some technical considerations.

An aircraft can stay aloft only by constantly traveling forward relative to the air (rather than the ground), so that the wings can generate aerodynamic lift. The thinner the air, the faster the plane must go to generate enough lift to stay up. At very high speeds, centrifugal force (Kepler force) contributes to maintaining altitude. This is the virtual force that keeps satellites in circular orbit without any aerodynamic lift.

As altitude increases and air density decreases, the speed to generate enough aerodynamic lift to support the aircraft weight increases until the speed becomes so high that the centrifugal force contribution becomes significant. At a high enough altitude, the centrifugal force will dominate over the lift force and the aircraft would become effectively an orbiting spacecraft instead of an aircraft supported by aerodynamic lift. 

In 1956, von Kármán presented a paper in which he discussed aerothermal limits to flight. The faster aircraft fly, the more heat they would generate due to aerodynamic heating from friction with the atmosphere and adiabatic processes. Based on the current state of the art, he calculated the speeds and altitudes at which continuous flight was possible—fast enough that enough lift would be generated and slow enough that the vehicle would not overheat. The chart included an inflection point at around , above which the minimum speed would place the vehicle into orbit.

The term &quot;Kármán line&quot; was invented by Andrew G. Haley in a 1959 paper, based on the chart in von Kármán&#x27;s 1956 paper, but Haley acknowledged that the limit was theoretical and would change as technology improved, as the minimum speed in von Kármán&#x27;s calculations was based on the speed-to-weight ratio of current aircraft, namely the Bell X-2, and the maximum speed based on current cooling technologies and heat-resistant materials. Haley also cited other technical considerations for that altitude, as it was approximately the altitude limit for an airbreathing jet engine based on current technology. In the same 1959 paper, Haley also referred to as the &quot;von Kármán Line&quot;, which was the lowest altitude at which free-radical atomic oxygen occurred.

== Alternatives to the FAI definition ==
The U.S. Armed Forces definition of an astronaut is a person who has flown higher than above mean sea level, approximately the line between the mesosphere and the thermosphere. NASA formerly used the FAI&#x27;s figure, though this was changed in 2005 to eliminate any inconsistency between military personnel and civilians flying in the same vehicle. Three veteran NASA X-15 pilots (John B. McKay, William H. Dana and Joseph Albert Walker) were retroactively (two posthumously) awarded their astronaut wings, as they had flown between and during the 1960s, but at the time had not been recognized as astronauts. The latter altitude, achieved twice by Walker, exceeds the modern international definition of the boundary of space.

The United States Federal Aviation Administration also recognizes this line as a space boundary:

Works by Jonathan McDowell (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics) and Thomas Gangale (University of Nebraska-Lincoln) in 2018 advocate that the demarcation of space should be at , citing as evidence von Kármán&#x27;s original notes and calculations (which concluded the boundary should be 270,000 ft), confirmation that orbiting objects can survive multiple perigees at altitudes around 80 to 90 km, plus functional, cultural, physical, technological, mathematical, and historical factors. More precisely, the paper summarizes:

These findings prompted the FAI to propose holding a joint conference with the International Astronautical Federation (IAF) in 2019 to &quot;fully explore&quot; the issue.

Another definition proposed in international law discussions defines the lower boundary of space as the lowest perigee attainable by an orbiting space vehicle, but does not specify an altitude. This is the definition adopted by the U.S. military. Due to atmospheric drag, the lowest altitude at which an object in a circular orbit can complete at least one full revolution without propulsion is approximately , whereas an object can maintain an elliptic orbit with perigee as low as about without propulsion. The U.S. government is resisting efforts to specify a precise regulatory boundary.

== For other planets ==
While the Kármán line is defined for Earth only, several scientists have estimated the corresponding figures for Mars and Venus. Isidoro Martínez arrived at and high, respectively, while Nicolas Bérend arrived at and .

==In popular culture==
In 2014, Oscar Sharp directed &quot;The Kármán Line&quot;, a British live-action drama short film starring Olivia Colman as Sarah, a wife and mother who suddenly starts levitating until she slowly and eventually crosses the eponymous Kármán line and into outer space.

NASA astronaut Aisha Bowe will be the first Black woman to fly on Blue Origin in Q1 2025 and only the sixth Black woman to cross the Kármán line.

<doc id="738150" wikidata="Q7594907" url="?curid=738150" title="St Neots Priory">
<text>St Neots Priory was a Benedictine monastery beside the town of St Neots in the historic county of Huntingdonshire, now a non-metropolitan district in the English county of Cambridgeshire.

==Anglo-Saxon monastery==
A monastery was first founded here in about 974 by Earl Aelric (or Leofric) and his wife Aelfleda (or Ethelfleda), who granted it two hides of land, part of the manor of Eynesbury, later called the manor of St Neots. Its site is uncertain, though it may have been where the present parish church stands. It is said that the relics of the Cornish Saint Neot were obtained from Neotstoke (now St Neot) in Cornwall and brought to the priory in order that it might have relics to attract pilgrims; hence the name of the town.

==An Alien Priory of Bec Abbey==
Saint Anselm, abbot of Bec Abbey in Normandy and later to be Archbishop of Canterbury, apparently visited the shrine of St Neot in 1078-9. In 1081 he sent eighteen monks from Bec to replace the Saxon monks, and had it re-founded by Richard Fitz Gilbert and his wife Rothais or Rohais, lords of the manor, as a male Benedictine priory dependent on Bec. In 1113 Rothais granted the whole manor of St Neots to the priory, which it held until its suppression.

The Anglo-Norman nobility gave considerable support to Bec Abbey, enriching it with extensive properties in England, where in addition to St Neots, Bec possessed in the 15th century several priories, namely, Stoke-by-Clare, Wilsford, Steventon, Cowick, Ogbourne, and at some point also Blakenham Priory and Povington Priory. Among these St Neots Priory was particularly large. Bec also had Goldcliff Priory in Monmouthshire.

The London suburb of Tooting Bec takes its name from the medieval village’s having been a possession of Bec Abbey.

At some point, quite possibly at the time of its re-foundation as a Benedictine priory, the monastery moved to a site on the riverside adjacent to a ford subsequently replaced by a bridge, a little way north of the present Market Square.

Because it was an alien priory (i.e., the dependency of a French mother-house) it suffered difficulties whenever there were hostilities between France and England, and particularly during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Its property was continually seized for this reason, until like certain other alien priories it was eventually given its independence from Bec in 1409 by the quasi-naturalisation process known as denization.

==The Dissolution==
The priory was finally seized during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539.

After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the buildings were pulled down. The Dissolution commissioners had instructions to &quot;pull down to the ground all the walls of the churches, stepulls, cloysters, fraterys, dorters, chapter howsys&quot; and all the rest. The materials were then to be sold for the profit of the Crown.

Of the priory nothing now remains above ground, the last remaining structure, a gateway, having been demolished in the late 18th century. A plaque marks the site.

<doc id="738162" wikidata="Q7510491" url="?curid=738162" title="Jim Baen">
<text>James Patrick Baen (| beɪn |; October 22, 1943 – June 28, 2006) was a U.S. science fiction publisher and editor. In 1983, he founded his own publishing house, Baen Books, specializing in the adventure, fantasy, military science fiction, and space opera genres. Baen also founded the video game publisher, Baen Software. In late 1999, he started an electronic publishing business called Webscriptions (since renamed to Baen Ebooks), which is considered to be the first profitable e-book vendor.

== Biography ==
Jim Baen was born in Pennsylvania. He left his stepfather&#x27;s home at the age of 17 and lived on the streets for several months before joining the United States Army; he served in Bavaria.

After stints at City College of New York and as the manager of a folk music coffee shop (a &quot;basket house&quot;) in Greenwich Village in the 1960s, he started his publishing career in the complaints department of Ace Books. In 1972, he got the job of an assistant Gothics editor.

===Magazine editor===
Baen was Judy-Lynn del Rey&#x27;s replacement as managing editor at &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; in 1973. He succeeded Ejler Jakobsson as editor of &quot;Galaxy&quot; and &quot;If&quot; in 1974. While at &quot;Galaxy&quot; (which absorbed &quot;If&quot; from 1975) he largely revitalised it, publishing such authors as Jerry Pournelle, Charles Sheffield, Joanna Russ, Spider Robinson, Algis Budrys, and John Varley, and was nominated for several Hugo Awards.

Pournelle, in 1983, described Baen as &quot;arguably one of the best science-fiction editors in the world. Certainly Larry Niven and I regard him among the top two or three we&#x27;ve ever worked with&quot;. Robert A. Heinlein dedicated his 1985 novel &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot; to
Baen and eight of the other members of the Citizens&#x27; Advisory Council on National Space Policy.

===Book publishing===

In 1977, he returned to Ace to head their science fiction line, working with publisher Tom Doherty. When Doherty left to start Tor Books in 1980, Baen shortly followed and started the SF line there.

In 1983, he had the opportunity to start his own independent company, Baen Books, distributed then and now by Pocket Books/Simon &amp; Schuster; this was possible in part thanks to release from a long-term contract by his good friend Doherty.

Baen Books has grown steadily since and established a large readership among fans of accessible adventure SF, publishing books by authors such as David Weber, John Ringo, Eric Flint, David Drake, Lois McMaster Bujold, Elizabeth Moon, Mercedes Lackey, Larry Niven, and many more. According to Eric Flint&#x27;s &quot;Editor&#x27;s Page&quot; column just after Baen&#x27;s death, once-tiny Baen Books had been voted the second most looked for &quot;label&quot; among science fiction fans up from fourth in 2004 and seventh in 2003. The rapid growth was credited as being due to Jim Baen&#x27;s electronic marketing strategy by seeming to court piracy, ignoring encryption, and giving away free titles on CD-ROM (See &quot;Electronic marketing strategy&quot; under Baen Books), by offering bundled &quot;bargain samplers&quot; and e-ARCs Baen&#x27;s e-marketing pulled in sales. People could sample the wares, decide they liked it, and pick up a tangible book to read which given the series orientation of the SF genre, translated into more than one book. In short, even as the average small town library is trimming titles carried and stocking up on audio-visual media, Baen took advantage of technology to counteract the former &quot;boost&quot; gotten from libraries buying titles and keeping them around.

===Early anthology series===
Baen edited several anthology series in paperback format, trying to combine the feeling of an anthology and a magazine. To achieve this, they were numbered and dated like a magazine and contained many magazine features: &quot;Destinies&quot; (Ace, 11 issues 1978-81), &quot;Far Frontiers&quot; (Baen, 7 issues 1985-6), and &quot;New Destinies&quot; (Baen, 8 issues numbered I to IV and VI to IX 1987-90). He also edited several volumes of reprints from &quot;Galaxy&quot; and &quot;If&quot; in the 1970s.

===eBooks===
After hearing Pournelle praise writing with a computer, Baen purchased an IBM PC in the early 1980s. Disliking the layout of the IBM PC keyboard, he commissioned and published Magic Keyboard, a utility to remap its keys. Baen started an experimental web publishing business called Webscriptions in late 1999. (It was relaunched as Baen Ebooks at the start of 2012.) Unlike other eBook publishers, Baen flatly refused to use encryption or even Adobe&#x27;s Portable Document Format (PDF), regarding digital rights management (DRM) as harmful not just to readers but also to authors and publishers. This stance was quite controversial at the time, but Baen Book&#x27;s hardcover sales numbers have soared in direct relation to the number of titles available as inexpensive e-books, while the competition&#x27;s remained flat or declined in the same period. As another measure, in comparison, e-royalties paid by Baen run circa 5% of a hardcover royalty over the same period, other publishers have paid out less than 1% comparatively on average — typical period numbers are a difference of four figures to two figures in e-royalties.
Critics at the time also dismissed the e-book market as too small. Instead, it is one of the few such enterprises that regularly turn a profit, breaking even in its first year.

These innovations earned him respect in the technological community, and increasing disbelief in the publishing trade with perhaps the best comment of all others began to mimic him, or place e-titles with Webscriptions themselves. One such title was even offered by Webscriptions using the despised (by J. Baen) Adobe PDF format, at its publishers insistence. Webscriptions is generally considered to be both the first e-books-for-money service whose product completely lacks encryption (in fact, Webscriptions makes each book available in a wide range of openly readable formats) and one of the first e-book publishing services to become profitable. (Indeed, it broke even in its first year and is likely the most profitable such service). In the words of David Drake, a writer with more than fifty books published:

===Free ebooks===
Along with Webscriptions, Baen created the Baen Free Library, where authors can make books available free of charge in the hope of attracting new readers. Though some scoffed at the idea of the free library, giving away ebooks turned out to increase sales.

===Stance on DRM===
Baen&#x27;s e-books did not use encryption or DRM. Baen was an outspoken opponent of DRM, regarding it as harmful to publishers and authors as well as readers.

With his death, many other publishers have come to agree with his methods and principles. His stance on DRM is considered to still have been the most extreme among mainstream publishers, but has grown in credibility over time. Eric Flint, who has been called &quot;Baen&#x27;s Bulldog&quot; on the DRM/Copy protection controversy believes that Jim Baen&#x27;s legacy will be the impact on the DRM issue, and that Baen will have saved society from the rapaciousness of big corporations because Jim Baen had the courage of convictions to spit in the face of encryption, and moreover, prove that non-encrypted, non-DRM-protected intellectual materials actually give a sales boost—exactly the opposite of the conventional wisdom.

===Forum participation and e-ARCs===
Jim Baen was very active on the web forum of the Baen website, called Baen&#x27;s Bar, which he started in May 1997; his interests included evolutionary biology, space technology, politics, military history, and puns.

Baen&#x27;s activity on the forums led to John Ringo becoming a published novelist. Ringo was a longtime participant in Baen&#x27;s Bar and had gotten to know Baen by discussing topics like the aquatic ape hypothesis. Although his novel &quot;A Hymn Before Battle&quot; had been rejected, he mentioned he had submitted it and it had been rejected when Baen told him the manuscript had been lost. Baen took a look at the manuscript, fired the reader who had rejected it, and told Ringo that if he made certain edits, Baen would buy it.

Another result of such interaction is that the barflies, the customers frequenting the site, actually talked Jim Baen into charging more for the e-book variation on the publishing trades&#x27; advance reading copy — (sampler packages of five books) the house was offering called e-ARCs (&quot;Advanced Reader Copies&quot;, emphasis on benefit to the &quot;Reader&quot;). Jim Baen would have been glad to break even on the e-biz, for he was firmly convinced the increased exposure would lead to increased sales, and it took only three years to prove it beyond much doubt, and about as long before even the competition could no longer deny the successes.

===The last half-decade===
In 2000, Baen was the editor guest of honor at Chicon 2000, that year&#x27;s Worldcon. With the interest shown in Flint&#x27;s &quot;1632&quot; series, he set up a second talk forum for the new writer, one specialized to the buzz of &quot;1632&quot;-verse called &quot;1632 Tech Manual&quot;. The fans wanted a sequel &quot;yesterday&quot;, the research was daunting, so he advised fledgling writers to open up the universe, to make it a shared universe long before the &quot;normal point&quot; in a fictional universe life-cycle; Flint was willing to gamble, and the result was &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;. Meanwhile, Baen had paired best-selling author David Weber with the emerging mid-list author Flint in a five-book contract, and the resulting &quot;1633&quot; created a new cycle of buzz and interest.

Flint suggested creating an e-zine to carry some of the fan fiction submitted for &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; or created subsequently. Baen took the risk, adapting his e-ARC system and Webscriptions for a magazine format. The result was &quot;The Grantville Gazettes&quot;. Baen Books subsequently published some of the stories as hardcopy anthologies; the fourth of those volumes was the last book Baen bought from Flint.

=== &quot;Jim Baen&#x27;s Universe&quot; ===
In late 2005 Baen announced plans for a bimonthly online science fiction magazine, which was originally named &quot;Baen&#x27;s Astounding Stories&quot;. After concerns over trademark infringement with Dell Magazines (publisher of &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot;, which was originally titled &quot;Astounding Stories&quot;), it was renamed &quot;Jim Baen&#x27;s Universe&quot;. The magazine, edited by Eric Flint, published its first issue in June 2006, authors contracted including David Drake and Timothy Zahn.

In August 2009, &quot;Baen&#x27;s Universe&quot; announced that they would be closing down the magazine due to financial issues, stating &quot;we were simply never able to get and retain enough subscribers to put us on a sales plateau that would allow us to continue publishing&quot;. 

Jim Baen had two daughters, Jessica (1977) with his wife of sixteen years, Madeline Gleich, and Katherine (1992) with Toni Weisskopf. He apparently had a premonition of his own death and suffered a massive bilateral thalamus stroke on June 12, 2006. He died on June 28 at Raleigh, North Carolina, without again regaining consciousness.
 According to Flint, he did get to see the first issue of his magazine before dying.

<text>Red bean cake is a type of Chinese cake with a sweet red bean paste filling. There are many regional varieties, including Taiwanese versions.

==Cantonese-style==
Cantonese-style red bean cake is made with hardened red bean paste that has been frozen. The cake is sweetened and sprinkled with sesame seed. It is generally tough to bite, and is served as a square block. Depending on the particular region within China, this may be seen as a year-round snack, or as a seasonal pastry consumed on certain traditional Chinese holidays.

<text>An orbital spaceflight (or orbital flight) is a spaceflight in which a spacecraft is placed on a trajectory where it could remain in space for at least one orbit. To do this around the Earth, it must be on a free trajectory which has an altitude at perigee (altitude at closest approach) around ; this is the boundary of space as defined by NASA, the US Air Force and the FAA. To remain in orbit at this altitude requires an orbital speed of ~7.8 km/s. Orbital speed is slower for higher orbits, but attaining them requires greater delta-v. The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale has established the Kármán line at an altitude of as a working definition for the boundary between aeronautics and astronautics. This is used because at an altitude of about , as Theodore von Kármán calculated, a vehicle would have to travel faster than orbital velocity to derive sufficient aerodynamic lift from the atmosphere to support itself.

Due to atmospheric drag, the lowest altitude at which an object in a circular orbit can complete at least one full revolution without propulsion is approximately .

The expression &quot;orbital spaceflight&quot; is mostly used to distinguish from sub-orbital spaceflights, which are flights where the apogee of a spacecraft reaches space, but the perigee is too low.

==Trajectory==

There are three main &quot;bands&quot; of orbit around the Earth: low Earth orbit (LEO), medium Earth orbit (MEO), and geostationary orbit (GEO).

According to orbital mechanics, an orbit lies in a particular, largely fixed plane around the Earth, which coincides with the center of the Earth, and may be inclined with respect to the equator. The relative motion of the spacecraft and the movement of the Earth&#x27;s surface, as the Earth rotates on its axis, determine the position that the spacecraft appears in the sky from the ground, and which parts of the Earth are visible from the spacecraft.

It is possible to calculate a ground track that shows which part of the Earth a spacecraft is immediately above; this is useful for helping to visualise the orbit.

==Launch==

Orbital spaceflight from Earth has only been achieved by launch vehicles that use rocket engines for propulsion. To reach orbit, the rocket must impart to the payload a delta-v of about 9.3–10 km/s. This figure is mainly (~7.8 km/s) for horizontal acceleration needed to reach orbital speed, but allows for atmospheric drag (approximately 300 m/s with the ballistic coefficient of a 20 m long dense fueled vehicle), gravity losses (depending on burn time and details of the trajectory and launch vehicle), and gaining altitude.

The main proven technique involves launching nearly vertically for a few kilometers while performing a gravity turn, and then progressively flattening the trajectory out at an altitude of 170+ km and accelerating on a horizontal trajectory (with the rocket angled upwards to fight gravity and maintain altitude) for a 5–8-minute burn until orbital velocity is achieved. Currently, 2–4 stages are needed to achieve the required delta-v. Most launches are by expendable launch systems.

The Pegasus rocket for small satellites instead launches from an aircraft at an altitude of .

There have been many proposed methods for achieving orbital spaceflight that have the potential of being much more affordable than rockets. Some of these ideas such as the space elevator, and rotovator, require new materials much stronger than any currently known. Other proposed ideas include ground accelerators such as launch loops, rocket-assisted aircraft/spaceplanes such as Reaction Engines Skylon, scramjet powered spaceplanes, and RBCC powered spaceplanes. Gun launch has been proposed for cargo.

From 2015 SpaceX have demonstrated significant progress in their more incremental approach to reducing the cost of orbital spaceflight. Their potential for cost reduction comes mainly from pioneering propulsive landing with their reusable rocket booster stage as well as their Dragon capsule, but also includes reuse of the other components such as the payload fairings and the use of 3D printing of a superalloy to construct more efficient rocket engines, such as their SuperDraco. The initial stages of these improvements could reduce the cost of an orbital launch by an order of magnitude.

==Stability==
An object in orbit at an altitude of less than roughly 200 km is considered unstable due to atmospheric drag. For a satellite to be in a stable orbit (i.e. sustainable for more than a few months), 350 km is a more standard altitude for low Earth orbit. For example, on 1 February 1958 the Explorer 1 satellite was launched into an orbit with a perigee of . It remained in orbit for more than 12 years before its atmospheric reentry over the Pacific Ocean on 31 March 1970.

However, the exact behaviour of objects in orbit depends on altitude, their ballistic coefficient, and details of space weather which can affect the height of the upper atmosphere.

==Orbit maintenance==
===Orbital maneuver===
In spaceflight, an orbital maneuver is the use of propulsion systems to change the orbit of a spacecraft. For spacecraft far from Earth—for example those in orbits around the Sun—an orbital maneuver is called a &quot;deep-space maneuver (DSM)&quot;.

==Deorbit and re-entry==
Returning spacecraft (including all potentially crewed craft) have to find a way of slowing down as much as possible while still in higher atmospheric layers and avoiding hitting the ground (lithobraking) or burning up. For many orbital space flights, initial deceleration is provided by the retrofiring of the craft&#x27;s rocket engines, perturbing the orbit (by lowering perigee down into the atmosphere) onto a suborbital trajectory. Many spacecraft in low Earth orbit (e.g., nanosatellites or spacecraft that have run out of station keeping fuel or are otherwise non-functional) solve the problem of deceleration from orbital speeds through using atmospheric drag (aerobraking) to provide initial deceleration. In all cases, once initial deceleration has lowered the orbital perigee into the mesosphere, all spacecraft lose most of the remaining speed, and therefore kinetic energy, through the atmospheric drag effect of aerobraking.

Intentional aerobraking is achieved by orienting the returning space craft so as to present the heat shields forward toward the atmosphere to protect against the high temperatures generated by atmospheric compression and friction caused by passing through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds. The thermal energy is dissipated mainly by compression heating the air in a shockwave ahead of the vehicle using a blunt heat shield shape, with the aim of minimising the heat entering the vehicle.

Sub-orbital space flights, being at a much lower speed, do not generate anywhere near as much heat upon re-entry.

Even if the orbiting objects are expendable, most space authorities are pushing toward controlled re-entries to minimize hazard to lives and property on the planet.

==History==
*Sputnik 1 was the first human-made object to achieve orbital spaceflight. It was launched on 4 October 1957 by the Soviet Union. 
*Vostok 1, launched by the Soviet Union on 12 April 1961, carrying Yuri Gagarin, was the first successful human spaceflight to reach Earth orbit.
*Vostok 6, launched by the Soviet Union on 16 June 1963, carrying Valentina Tereshkova, was the first successful spaceflight by a woman to reach Earth orbit.
*Crew Dragon Demo-2, launched by SpaceX and the United States on 30 May 2020, was the first successful human spaceflight by a private company to reach Earth orbit.

<text>Quercitron is a yellow natural dye obtained from the bark of the Eastern Black Oak (&quot;Quercus velutina&quot;), a forest tree indigenous in North America. It was formerly called Dutch pink, English pink, or Italian pink.

The name is a shortened form of quercicitron, from Latin &quot;quercus&quot;, oak, and &quot;citron&quot;, lemon, and was invented by Edward Bancroft (1744–1821), who by act of Parliament (25 Geo. 3. c. 38) in 1785 was granted special privileges in regard to the importation and use of the substance. The dyestuff is prepared by grinding the bark in mills after it has been freed from its black epidermal layer, and sifting the product to separate the fibrous matter, the fine yellow powder which remains forming the quercitron of commerce.

The ruddy-orange decoction of quercitron contains quercitannic acid, whence its use in tanning, and an active dyeing principle, quercitrin, C21H20O11. The latter substance is a glycoside, and in aqueous solution under the influence of mineral acids it yields quercetin, C15H10O7, which is precipitated, and the methyl-pentose rhamnose.

Quercetin is a crystalline powder of a brilliant citron yellow color, entirely insoluble in cold water and dissolving only sparingly in hot water, but quite soluble in alcohol. Either by itself or in some form of its glucoside quercitrin, quercetin is found in several vegetable substances, among others in cutch, in Persian berries (&quot;Rhamnus cathartica&quot;), buckwheat leaves (&quot;Fagopyrum esculentum&quot;), Zante fustic wood (&quot;Rhus cotinus&quot;), and in rose petals.

Chemically, quercetin is a member of a fairly extensive class of natural coloring matters derived from phenyl benzoyl-pyrone or flavone, the constitution of which followed on the researches of Stanisław Kostanecki, A. G. Perkin, Herzig, Goldschmidt and others. Among the related, coloring matters are: chrysin from poplar buds, apigenin from parsley, luteolin from weld, mignonette and dyer&#x27;s broom, fisetin from young fustic and yellow cypress, galangin from galangal root, and myricetin from &quot;Nageia nagi&quot;.

In Iowa in the late 1840s and early 1850s, according to the historian Philip Dillon Jordan:

<doc id="738184" wikidata="Q553670" url="?curid=738184" title="Osami Nagano">
<text>was a Marshal Admiral of the Imperial Japanese Navy and one of the leaders of Japan&#x27;s military during most of the Second World War. In April 1941, he became Chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff. In this capacity, he served as the navy&#x27;s commander-in-chief in the Asia-Pacific theater of World War II until his removal in February 1944. After the war, he was arrested by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East but died of natural causes in prison during the trial.

==Early life and career==
Nagano was born in Kōchi to an ex-&quot;samurai&quot; family. In 1900, he graduated from the 28th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, ranking second in a class of 105 cadets. After completing service as a midshipman on the cruiser and the battleship , he was commissioned an ensign and assigned to the cruiser . During the Russo-Japanese War, he served in a number of staff positions. The closest he came to combat was commanding a land-based heavy naval gun unit during the siege of Port Arthur.

After his promotion to lieutenant in 1905, Nagano served on the battleship . From 1905 to 1906, he studied naval artillery and navigation. From 1906 to 1908, he was chief gunnery officer on the cruiser . In 1909, he graduated from the Japanese Naval War College.

In 1910, Nagano was promoted to lieutenant commander and assigned as chief gunnery officer on the battleship . From January 1913 to April 1915, he was a language officer in the United States, during which time he studied at Harvard Law School.

During World War I, Nagano was executive officer on the cruisers and cruiser . In 1918, he was promoted to captain. In 1919, he received his first (and only) ship command, the cruiser .

From December 1920, Nagano was a military attaché to the United States. In this capacity, he attended the Washington Naval Conference. In November 1923, he returned home, although he returned to the United States on official visits in 1927 and 1933. In December 1923, he was promoted to rear admiral.

==Rise to Imperial Navy Leadership==

In February 1924, Nagano was chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff Third Section (Intelligence). From December 1924, he commanded the 3rd Battleship Division. From April 1925, he commanded the 1st China Expeditionary Fleet. In December 1927, he was promoted to vice admiral.

From 1928 to 1929, Nagano was commandant of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy. Nagano introduced and influenced Progressive education method such as Dalton Plan to Japanese Naval Academy. 

From 1930 to 1931, he was vice chief of the Navy General Staff, in which capacity he attended the Geneva Naval Conference. 
He attended the London Naval Conference 1930. From 1933 to 1934, he was commander in chief of the Yokosuka Naval District.
On 1 March 1934, he was promoted to admiral and appointed to the Supreme War Council. Nagano was the chief naval delegate to the London Naval Conference 1935. Japan withdrew in protest from the 1935 London Conference after it was denied naval parity with the United States and Great Britain.

In 1936, Nagano was appointed Navy Minister under Prime Minister Kōki Hirota. Later in 1937, he became commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet. By April 1941, he had risen to the very top of the Japanese Navy leadership to become chief of the Imperial Japanese Naval General Staff.

==World War II==
A staunch believer in &quot;Nanshin-ron &quot;, Admiral Nagano played a central role in Japan&#x27;s decision to go to war with the United States. After Japanese forces occupied southern Indochina on 24 July 1941, the U.S. and its Western Allies froze Japanese assets within their borders thereby resulting in a halt on all oil shipments to Japan. At the end of the month, Nagano informed Emperor Hirohito that the nation&#x27;s oil supply would run out in two years if the embargo was not lifted. Consequently, he advised that Japan should be ready for war within that timeframe if attempts at diplomacy failed. By September 1941, he and the Army&#x27;s Chief of Staff, General Hajime Sugiyama, called for Japan to be placed on an immediate war-footing and for an end to all negotiations by mid-October. 

According to some Japanese sources, Nagano presented a peace proposal before a conference on November 1, 1941 but this was ultimately struck down by Prime Minister Tojo Hideki..

Viewing it as a needless diversion of Japan&#x27;s carrier fleet, Nagano initially opposed Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto&#x27;s planned attack on Pearl Harbor. However, he reluctantly approved the attack after Yamamoto threatened to resign as the commander of the Combined Fleet. Between 1941 and 1944, at meetings with the top Army staff, Nagano reputedly napped. 

In 1943, Nagano was promoted to marshal admiral. By 1944, however, Japan had suffered serious military setbacks and Nagano had lost the confidence of Emperor Hirohito. With the emperor&#x27;s approval, Prime Minister Hideki Tōjō and Navy Minister Shigetarō Shimada removed Nagano from his post and replaced him. Nagano spent the remainder of the war as an advisor to the government.

==Remark==
*According to the opinion of the Japanese government, if Japan accepts the demand of the United States, Japan will perish. However, even if Japan fights against the United States, Japan may perish. That is, accepting the request of the United States will destroy Japan without fighting the United States. Even if we fight against the United States, if Japan can not avoid the danger of extinction, if Japan defeats without fighting with the United States, the Japanese people will truly disappear from the earth. However, if Japanese people can fight and show the spirit of defending Japan, even if Japan fights against America, our descendants will always rebuild Japan. We hope to solve problems in diplomatic negotiations. But unfortunately we will be fighting if we are to be commanded to wage war. (September 6, 1941, Osami Nagano) 

==War crimes trial==
After World War II in 1945, the American Occupation forces arrested Nagano. He was charged with Class A war criminal charges before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo. When US naval officers interrogated him, he was described as &quot;thoroughly cooperative,&quot; &quot;keenly alert,&quot; &quot;intelligent,&quot; and &quot;anxious to develop American friendship.&quot; He died of a heart attack due to complications arising from pneumonia in Sugamo Prison in Tokyo before the conclusion of his trial.

<text>In macroeconomics, an open market operation (OMO) is an activity by a central bank to exchange liquidity in its currency with a bank or a group of banks. The central bank can either transact government bonds and other financial assets in the open market or enter into a repurchase agreement or secured lending transaction with a commercial bank. The latter option, often preferred by central banks, involves them making fixed period deposits at commercial banks with the security of eligible assets as collateral.

Central banks regularly use OMOs as one of their tools for implementing monetary policy. A frequent aim of open market operations is — aside from supplying commercial banks with liquidity and sometimes taking surplus liquidity from commercial banks — to influence the short-term interest rate. Open market operations have become less prominent in this respect since the 2007–2008 financial crisis, however, as many central banks have changed their monetary policy implementation to a so-called floor system (or system of ample reserves), in which there is abundant liquidity in the payments system. In that situation central banks no longer need to fine tune the supply of reserves to meet demand, implying that they may conduct OMOs less frequently. For countries operating under an exchange rate anchor, direct intervention in the foreign exchange market, which is a specific type of open market operations, may be an important tool to maintain the desired exchange rate.

In the post-crisis economy, conventional short-term open market operations have been superseded by major central banks by quantitative easing (QE) programmes. QE are technically similar to open-market operations, but entail a pre-commitment of the central bank to conduct purchases to a predefined large volume and for a predefined period of time. Under QE, central banks typically purchase riskier and longer-term securities such as long maturity sovereign bonds and even corporate bonds.

==Process of open market operations ==
The central bank maintains loro accounts for a group of commercial banks, the so-called direct payment banks. A balance on such a loro account (it is a nostro account in the view of the commercial bank) represents central bank money in the regarded currency.

Since central bank money currently exists mainly in the form of electronic records (electronic money) rather than in the form of paper or coins (physical money), open market operations can be conducted by simply increasing or decreasing (&quot;crediting&quot; or &quot;debiting&quot;) the amount of electronic money that a bank has in its reserve account at the central bank. This does not require the creation of new physical currency, unless a direct payment bank demands to exchange a part of its electronic money against banknotes or coins.

In most developed countries, central banks are not allowed to give loans without requiring suitable assets as collateral. Therefore, most central banks describe which assets are eligible for open market transactions. Technically, the central bank makes the loan and synchronously takes an equivalent amount of an eligible asset supplied by the borrowing commercial bank.

When a central bank sells securities, that diminishes the money supply because the money transfers from the overall economy into the central bank, as payment for the securities. This selling of securities affects the overall economy by decreasing demand for products, services, and workers (because there is less money in circulation that is available for spending), while increasing interest rates and decreasing inflation (because money that is scarcer is more valuable and hard to get which causes people to offer more for it and also demand more for it). When the central bank buys securities on the open market, that has the opposite effects from selling securities.

==Theoretical relationship to interest rates==

Classical economic theory postulates a distinctive relationship between the supply of central bank money and short-term interest rates: 
central bank money is like any other commodity in that a higher demand tends to increase its price (the interest rate).
When there is an increased demand for base money, the central bank must act if it wishes to maintain the short-term interest rate. It does this by increasing the supply of base money: it goes to the open market to buy a financial asset, such as government bonds. To pay for these assets, new central bank money is generated in the seller&#x27;s loro account, increasing the total amount of base money in the economy. Conversely, if the central bank sells these assets in the open market, the base money is reduced.

The process works because the central bank has the authority to bring money in and out of existence. It is the only point in the whole system with the unlimited ability to produce money. Another organization may be able to influence the open market for a period of time, but the central bank will always be able to overpower their influence with an infinite supply of money.

Side note: Countries that have a free floating currency not pegged to any commodity or other currency have a similar capacity to produce an unlimited amount of net financial assets (bonds). Understandably, governments would like to utilize this capacity to meet other political ends like unemployment rate targeting, or relative size of various public services (military, education, health etc.), rather than any specific interest rate.
Mostly, however the central bank is prevented by law or convention from giving way to such demands, being required to only generate central bank money in exchange for eligible assets (see above).

==Possible targets==
* Under inflation targeting, open market operations target a specific short-term interest rate in the debt markets. This target is changed periodically to achieve and maintain an inflation rate within a target range. However, other variants of monetary policy also often target interest rates: the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank use variations on interest rate targets to guide open market operations.
* Besides interest rate targeting there are other possible targets of open markets operations. A second possible target is the contraction of the money supply, as was the case in the U.S. in the late 1970s through the early 1980s under Fed Chairman Paul Volcker.
* Under a currency board open market operations would be used to achieve and maintain a fixed exchange rate with relation to some foreign currency.
* Under a gold standard, notes would be convertible to gold, and so open market operations could be used to keep the value of a currency constant relative to gold.
* A central bank can also use a mixture of policy settings that change depending on circumstances. A central bank may peg its exchange rate (like a currency board) with different levels or forms of commitment. The looser the exchange rate peg, the more latitude the central bank has to target other variables (such as interest rates). It may instead target a basket of foreign currencies rather than a single currency. In some instances it is empowered to use additional means other than open market operations, such as changes in reserve requirements or capital controls, to achieve monetary outcomes.

==How open market operations are conducted==

===United States===
In the United States before the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve used open market operations to keep its key policy rate, the federal funds rate, around the target set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) by adjusting the supply of reserve balances of commercial banks suitably. Since late 2008, however, the implementation of monetary policy has changed considerably. In contrast to the former so-called limited reserves regime, the Fed implemented what the institution refers to as an ample reserves regime where the market interest rate is not adjusted via open market operations, but more directly through changes in the Fed&#x27;s central administered rates, which are the interest on reserve balances rate (IORB) and the overnight reverse repurchase agreement offering rate (ON RRP rate). Open-market operations consequently are no longer used to steer the federal funds rate. However, they still form part of the over-all monetary policy toolbox, as they are used to always maintain an ample supply of reserves. In 2019, the Fed announced that it would continue to use this implementation regime over the longer run. The system is also known internationally as a floor system as opposed to the former corridor system, in which open market operations are used to determine the actual market interest rate.

The Federal Reserve has conducted open market operations since the 1920s, through the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, under the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee.

===Eurozone===
The European Central Bank has similar mechanisms for their operations; it describes its methods as a four-tiered approach with different goals: beside its main goal of steering and smoothing Eurozone interest rates while managing the liquidity situation in the market the ECB also has the aim of signalling the stance of monetary policy with its operations.

Broadly speaking, the ECB controls liquidity in the banking system via refinancing operations, which are basically repurchase agreements, i.e. banks put up acceptable collateral with the ECB and receive a cash loan in return. These are the following main categories of refinancing operations that can be employed depending on the desired outcome:
* Regular weekly main refinancing operations (MRO) with maturity of one week and,
* Monthly longer-term refinancing operations (LTRO) provide liquidity to the financial sector, while &quot;ad hoc&quot;
* &quot;Fine-tuning operations&quot; aim to smooth interest rates caused by liquidity fluctuations in the market through reverse or outright transactions, foreign exchange swaps, and the collection of fixed-term deposits
* &quot;Structural operations&quot; are used to adjust the central banks&#x27; longer-term structural positions vis-à-vis the financial sector.

Refinancing operations are conducted via an auction mechanism. The ECB specifies the amount of liquidity it wishes to auction (called the allotted amount) and asks banks for expressions of interest. In a fixed rate tender the ECB also specifies the interest rate at which it is willing to lend money; alternatively, in a variable rate tender the interest rate is not specified and banks bid against each other (subject to a minimum bid rate specified by the ECB) to access the available liquidity.

MRO auctions are held on Mondays, with settlement (i.e., disbursal of the funds) occurring the following Wednesday. For example, at its auction on 6 October 2008, the ECB made available 250 million in EUR on 8 October at a minimum rate of 4.25%. It received 271 million in bids, and the allotted amount (250) was awarded at an average weighted rate of 4.99%.

Since mid-October 2008, however, the ECB has been following a different procedure on a temporary basis, the fixed rate MRO with &quot;full allotment&quot;. In this case the ECB specifies the rate but not the amount of credit made available, and banks can request as much as they wish (subject as always to being able to provide sufficient collateral). This procedure was made necessary by the financial crisis of 2008 and is expected to end at some time in the future.

Though the ECB&#x27;s main refinancing operations (&quot;MRO&quot;) are from repo auctions with a (bi)weekly maturity and monthly maturation, Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs) are also issued, which traditionally mature after three months; since 2008, tenders are now offered for six months, 12 months and 36 months.

===Switzerland===
The Swiss National Bank (SNB) currently targets the three-month Swiss franc LIBOR rate. The primary way the SNB influences the three-month Swiss franc LIBOR rate is through open market operations, with the most important monetary policy instrument being repo transactions.

===India===
India&#x27;s Open Market Operation is much influenced by the fact that it is a developing country and that the capital flows are very different from those in developed countries. Thus India&#x27;s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has to make policies and use instruments accordingly. The RBI uses Open Market Operations (OMO) along with other monetary policy tools such as repo rate, cash reserve ratio and statutory liquidity ratio to adjust the quantum and price of money in the system. Prior to the 1991 financial reforms, RBI&#x27;s major source of funding and control over credit and interest rates was the cash reserve ratio (CRR) and the SLR (Statutory Liquidity Ratio). But after the reforms, the use of CRR as an effective tool was deemphasized and the use of open market operations increased. OMOs are more effective in adjusting [market liquidity].

The two type of OMOs used by RBI:
# Outright purchase (&quot;): Is outright buying or selling of government securities. (Permanent).
# Repurchase agreement (&quot;): Is short term, and are subject to repurchase.

However, even after sidelining CRR as an instrument, there was still less liquidity and skewedness in the market. And thus, on the recommendations of the Narsimham Committee Report (1998), the RBI brought together a Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF). It commenced in June, 2000, and it was set up to oversee liquidity on a daily basis and to monitor market interest rates. For the LAF, two rates are set by the RBI: repo rate and reverse repo rate. The repo rate is applicable while selling securities to RBI (daily injection of liquidity), while the reverse repo rate is applicable when banks buy back those securities (daily absorption of liquidity). Also, these interest rates fixed by the RBI also help in determining other market interest rates.

India experiences large capital inflows every day, and even though the OMO and the LAF policies were able to withhold the inflows, another instrument was needed to keep the liquidity intact. Thus, on the recommendations of the Working Group of RBI on instruments of sterilization (December, 2003), a new scheme known as the market stabilization scheme (MSS) was set up. The LAF and the OMO&#x27;s were dealing with day-to-day liquidity management, whereas the MSS was set up to sterilize the liquidity absorption and make it more enduring.

According to this scheme, the RBI issues additional -bills and securities to absorb the liquidity. The money received goes into the Market Stabilization Scheme Account (&quot;MSSA&quot;). The RBI cannot use this account for paying any interest or discounts and cannot credit any premiums to this account. The government, in collaboration with the RBI, fixes a ceiling amount on the issue of these instruments.

<text>Cholecystokinin receptors or CCK receptors are a group of G-protein coupled receptors which bind the peptide hormones cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin. There are two different subtypes CCKA and CCKB which are ~50% homologous: Various cholecystokinin antagonists have been developed and are used in research, although the only drug of this class that has been widely marketed to date is the anti-ulcer drug proglumide.

Located south of the city centre, it is considered as Belgian&#x27;s strawberry capital, with the Wépion strawberry an established concept in Belgian cuisine. The strawberry has been cultivated there for more than 150 years because Wépion benefits from a micro-climate, sun-exposed plantations on west sloping ground and has a perfect ground for this type of culture.

It produces a strawberry beer under the brand name &quot;La Wépionnaise&quot;.

<doc id="738197" wikidata="Q419492" url="?curid=738197" title="Akiyama Yoshifuru">
<text>was a general in the Imperial Japanese Army, and was considered the father of modern Japanese cavalry. He was the older brother of Vice Admiral Akiyama Saneyuki.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born as the third son to a bankrupt samurai in the Matsuyama Domain, Iyo Province (modern Ehime Prefecture), Akiyama worked as a fire stoker and janitor in a local public bathhouse as a child.

Akiyama entered the &quot;Rikugun Shikan Gakkō&quot; (the forerunner of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy) in 1877. He went on to attend the Army Staff College, and was sent as a military attaché to France to study cavalry tactics and techniques. He was the only Japanese officer sent to study at the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr at a time when the rest of the Japanese Army had turned to the Imperial German Army as its model and was being taught by instructors from Germany.

Akiyama was often mistaken for a European student by many foreign instructors such as Jakob Meckel while at the Japanese Army Academy. He was reputed to be a plain-living person who had a bowl of rice with slices of pickles for his meal. However, he spent his money on &quot;sake&quot; and was known to be a heavy drinker.

===Military career===

Akiyama was active in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895 as a cavalry regimental commander in the IJA 1st Division, and served with Japanese expeditionary forces in the subsequent Boxer Rebellion with the IJA 5th Division. In the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, he led his troops in the Battle of Shaho, Battle of Sandepu, and in the Battle of Mukden against the Cossack cavalry divisions of the Imperial Russian Army. In April 1906, he was awarded the Order of the Golden Kite (2nd class).

Akiyama became commander of the IJA 13th Division in 1913, and after his promotion to full general in 1916, was given command of the Imperial Guards Division. The following year, he was assigned command of the Chosen Army. In 1920, he became Director General for Military Education.

After he retired from active military service in 1923, declining promotion to Field Marshal, he returned to his native island of Shikoku and became the principal of the Hokuyō Junior High School (present-day Matsuyama High School). Akiyama died of complications from diabetes at the Army Medical School Hospital in Tokyo in 1930, and his grave is in the city of Matsuyama.

==Portrayals in fiction==
Akiyama is one of the main characters of &quot;Saka no Ue no Kumo&quot; (&quot;Clouds Over the Slope&quot;), a novel by Ryōtarō Shiba, adapted as a historical drama on the Japanese television network NHK from 2009 to 2011. Akiyama was portrayed by actor Hiroshi Abe.

Akiyama inspired the character Dot Pixis in the manga series &quot;Attack on Titan&quot;. When series author, Hajime Isayama, stated this inspiration he received death threats and criticism regarding the general&#x27;s actions in the military, primarily regarding Akiyama and his division&#x27;s involvement in the Port Arthur Massacre.

<doc id="738198" wikidata="Q4551092" url="?curid=738198" title="1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (musical)">
<text>1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is a 1976 musical with music by Leonard Bernstein and book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner. It is considered to be a legendary Broadway flop, running only seven performances. It was Bernstein&#x27;s last original score for Broadway.

==Original Broadway production==
The musical opened on May 4, 1976, at the Mark Hellinger Theatre and closed on May 8, 1976, after 7 performances and 13 previews. It was co-directed and co-choreographed by Gilbert Moses and George Faison.

The musical examined the establishment of the White House and its occupants from 1800 to 1900. Primarily focusing on race relations, the story depicted (among other incidents) Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s then-alleged affair with a black slave, James Monroe&#x27;s refusal to halt slavery in Washington, the aftermath of the American Civil War and Andrew Johnson&#x27;s impeachment. Throughout the show, the leading actors performed multiple roles: Ken Howard played all the presidents, Patricia Routledge all the First Ladies, and Gilbert Price and Emily Yancy played the White House servants, Lud and Seena. Future Broadway stars Reid Shelton, Walter Charles, Beth Fowler and Richard Muenz appeared in ensemble roles, as did the young African American baritone Bruce Hubbard.

The show was originally intended to be performed as a play-within-a-play, with the show&#x27;s actors stepping out of character to comment on the plot and debate race relations from a modern standpoint. But this concept was almost entirely removed during the show&#x27;s out-of-town tryouts in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. The musical&#x27;s original director, Frank Corsaro, choreographer, Donald McKayle, and set and costume designer, Tony Walton, left the production during these tryouts.

By the time the show opened on Broadway, little of the metatheatrical concept remained, aside from certain scenic and costume elements and a few musical references (most notably, the opening number &quot;Rehearse!&quot;).

Discouraged by the critical and public response to the work and angry that during the tryouts much of his music had been condensed and edited without his consent, Bernstein refused to allow a cast recording of the musical.

==Critical reaction==

The initial critical response to the show was resoundingly negative. Critics savaged Lerner&#x27;s book while largely praising Bernstein&#x27;s score. Only Patricia Routledge was spared, thanks mostly to her second act showstopper &quot;Duet for One (The First Lady of the Land)&quot; for which she received a mid-show standing ovation on opening night in New York and a mid-show standing ovation from the orchestra on closing night. After Bernstein&#x27;s death a concert version of the score, retitled &quot;A White House Cantata&quot; was recorded and released. That version tended to be reviewed as a classical work rather than a Broadway musical, a tendency encouraged by the casting of the leading roles with opera singers. Differences in the score and performance style make it impossible to judge the original musical fairly from the later recording. The score is considered by many musical theater historians and aficionados to be a forgotten, or at least neglected, masterpiece. Some of the songs have enjoyed some fame outside the show including &quot;Take Care of This House,&quot; &quot;The President Jefferson Sunday Luncheon Party March&quot; and &quot;Duet for One&quot;, a for a single actress portraying both Julia Grant and Lucy Hayes on the day of Rutherford B. Hayes&#x27;s inauguration detailing the exhausting vote counts that had many questioning his legitimacy.

Author Ethan Mordden noted that &quot;Bernstein and Lerner created an astonishingly good score, even a synoptic all-American one, with fanfare, march, waltz, blues. It&#x27;s Bernstein&#x27;s most classical work for Broadway.&quot;

==Reuse of material in other works==
As with his previously abandoned projects, Bernstein used portions of the score in subsequent works. In &quot;&quot;, for example, the setting of Walt Whitman&#x27;s poem &quot;To What You Said&quot; as a baritone solo was a reworking of the original prelude of the show, in which the chorus hummed a melody played by the violoncello in the &quot;Songfest&quot; version. (In the show, this music was moved to the emotional low point of the second act, used as background to a Presidential funeral.) The occasional piece &quot;Slava! A Political Overture&quot;, written in honor of Bernstein&#x27;s friend Mstislav Rostropovich, blended two numbers from the show, the up-tempo &quot;Rehearse!&quot; and &quot;The Grand Old Party.&quot; Early in the opera &quot;A Quiet Place&quot;, the music for the aria &quot;You&#x27;re late, you shouldn&#x27;t have come&quot; derives from that of &quot;Me,&quot; a song that in the original show established the meta-theatrical concept that was eventually abandoned. (Some of the music for &quot;Me&quot; can be heard in the Broadway score, most memorably in the song &quot;American Dreaming.&quot;) An instrumental section of &quot;The President Jefferson March&quot; was reused in the final movement, &quot;In Memoriam and March: The BSO Forever,&quot; of the Divertimento. Bernstein reused part of the song &quot;To Make Us Proud&quot; for his &quot;Olympic Hymn&quot; of 1981.

==Subsequent revivals==

The show&#x27;s only significant revival was a 1992 Indiana University Opera Theatre production, which used a pre-Philadelphia draft of the script and included portions of Bernstein&#x27;s music that had been excised on the road to Broadway. This production also played briefly at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., in August 1992.

==&quot;A White House Cantata&quot;==

After Bernstein&#x27;s death in 1990, the heirs of his estate sifted through the many variations and revisions of the score and authorized &quot;A White House Cantata&quot;, a choral version that deleted nearly all the remaining play-within-a-play references. (Some can still be heard in the duet &quot;Monroviad.&quot;) BBC Radio broadcast the London debut of this work in 1997, and three years later Deutsche Grammophon released an abridged performance in a CD recording. Both the London concert and the DG recording were conducted by Kent Nagano with the London Symphony Orchestra. The Leonard Bernstein estate controls the licensing of performances of the cantata version, while the original musical is not available for license.

==Recordings of individual numbers==
Although no cast album was made, Patricia Routledge&#x27;s performance of &quot;Duet for One&quot; survives as a private recording in mono from the premiere, complete with standing ovation.

Individual numbers from the work have been commercially recorded and performed by a variety of notable singers. &quot;Take Care of This House&quot; was sung by Frederica von Stade under Bernstein&#x27;s direction at the inauguration of Jimmy Carter. The song was subsequently recorded by Judy Kaye, Joanna Gleason, Julie Andrews, and opera singers Marilyn Horne and Roberta Alexander. In the 21st century &quot;Take Care of This House&quot; was recorded by Kelli O&#x27;Hara for the 2012 album &quot;Celebrating the American Spirit&quot; conducted by Judith Clurman, and by Barbra Streisand for her 2018 album &quot;Walls&quot;.

&quot;The President Jefferson March&quot; and &quot;Duet for One&quot; both appear in their original (pre-Broadway) versions on an EMI disc called &quot;Broadway Showstoppers&quot;, conducted by John McGlinn and sung by Davis Gaines and Judy Kaye. The late African American baritone Bruce Hubbard, a member of the original Broadway ensemble, also recorded Lud&#x27;s ballad &quot;Seena&quot; on his album &quot;For You, For Me&quot;, which was reissued in 2005. Sarah Brightman performed &quot;Lud&#x27;s Wedding&quot; on &quot;The Songs That Got Away&quot;, her 1989 collection of lost Broadway songs.

==Plot==
Philadelphia:

A theater group is rehearsing a play. The time of the rehearsal is the present, and the time of the play being rehearsed is 1792 to 1902. The play being rehearsed is a history of the White House and the servants who serve the President. One actor plays all the Presidents, and one actress plays all the First Ladies. The main serving staff are the African-American characters of Lud Simmons and Seena. Three generations of adult and young Lud&#x27;s are played by the same two actors. Lud is an escaped slave who later marries Seena. The events covered in the play include the selection of a new capital city, the Burning of Washington in 1814, the prelude to the U.S. Civil War, the Impeachment of Andrew Johnson, the 1876 presidential election, and the administration of Chester Alan Arthur. In between rehearsing the various scenes, the actors offer commentary and reflect on the past injustices suffered by black people throughout the time period covered by the play. This culminates in the Actor Playing the President and the Actor Playing Lud refusing to continue rehearsing the show. After reflection, the Actor Playing the President realizes all he wanted was to feel proud of his country and that he loves this land.

New York:

The four main cast members address the audience and inform them that the play covers the first one hundred years of the White House. They say America is a play that is always in rehearsal, undergoing revisions and improvements. The plot then covers the same historical material as the Philadelphia version; however, the actors&#x27; commentary is entirely removed.

<doc id="738199" wikidata="Q7098636" url="?curid=738199" title="Opposition research">
<text>In politics, opposition research (also called oppo research) is the practice of collecting information on a political opponent or other adversary that can be used to discredit or otherwise weaken them. The information can include biographical, legal, criminal, medical, educational, or financial history or activities, as well as prior media coverage, or the voting record of a politician. Opposition research can also entail using trackers to follow an individual and record their activities or political speeches.

The research is usually conducted in the time period between announcement of intent to run and the actual election; however political parties maintain long-term databases that can cover several decades. The practice is both a tactical maneuver and a cost-saving measure. The term is frequently used to refer not just to the collection of information but also how it is utilized, as a component of negative campaigning.

==Origins and history==
In the 1st century BC, Cicero is said to have gathered information that was damaging to opponents and used it in attacks against them. He accused one political opponent, Catiline, of murdering one wife to make room for another. He attacked Mark Antony in speeches known as the &quot;Philippicae&quot;, eventually prompting Antony to chop off his head and right hand and display them at the Roman Forum.

Opposition research also has its origins in military planning, as evident in such ancient texts as &quot;The Art of War&quot;, published in the 5th century BC by Sun Tzu. This manual for warriors describes the necessity for understanding an opponent&#x27;s weaknesses, for using spies, and for striking in moments of weakness.

In 18th-century England and Ireland, opposition research took the form of scandal-mongering pamphlet wars between the Whig and Tory parties. Writers such as Daniel Defoe, Jonathan Swift, and Henry Fielding participated, often writing under assumed names. This tradition of robust attack was replicated later in the American colonies, when writers such as Thomas Paine and Benjamin Franklin conducted opposition research and published their results.

The first appearance of the phrase &quot;opposition research&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot; occurred on December 17, 1971, in an article that describes the infiltration of the Edmund Muskie presidential campaign by a female Republican volunteer: &quot;...an article appeared in a Washington newspaper describing the &#x27;opposition research&#x27; program at Republican headquarters...&quot;

Opposition research became systematized in the 1970s, when Ken Khachigian, a speechwriter in the Nixon Administration, suggested that the GOP keep files on individuals as insurance against future races, rather than &quot;scramble&quot; in an &quot;ad hoc&quot; fashion, race by race.

==Methods==

Opposition research differs immensely depending on the size and funding of a campaign, the ethics of the candidate, and the era in which it is conducted. Information gathering can be classified into three main categories: open-source research enabled by the Freedom of Information Act, covert operations or &quot;tradecraft, &quot; and maintenance of human systems of informants. Increasingly, data-mining of electronic records is used. Information is then stored for future use, and disseminated in a variety of ways. A local election sometimes has a staff member dedicated to reading through all of the opponents&#x27; public statements and their voting records; others initiate whisper campaigns that employ techniques of disinformation or &quot;black ops&quot; to deliberately mislead the public by advancing a pre-determined &quot;narrative&quot; that will present the opponent in a negative light.

Another technique is to infiltrate the opposition&#x27;s operations and position a paid informant there. &quot;Gray propaganda&quot; techniques are often used to release damaging information to news media outlets without its source being identified properly, a technique inherited from disinformation tactics employed by intelligence agencies such as the Office of Strategic Services during World War II.

File-sharing between operatives of political parties is quite common. In the 2008 presidential election, a dossier of opposition research against Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin was posted in its entirety on a political blog site, Politico.com. The file was compiled by the staff of her opponent in the 2006 Alaska gubernatorial race, Tony Knowles.

&quot;Oppo dumps&quot; are used by political campaigns to systematically supply files of damaging information to press outlets, including matters of the public record, video footage from party archives and private collections, as well as private intelligence gathered by operatives. Many prime time television and radio news commentaries rely on this supply of party-generated material because it is free, and therefore more cost-effective than paying investigative reporters.

Candidates and incumbents who benefit from opposition research often choose to remain uninformed about their campaign&#x27;s operations and tactics, to ensure plausible deniability should criminal charges be brought against researchers.

===Trackers and videography===
Another technique is to position information or personnel within media outlets. Often the information is video footage gathered in campaign-funded &quot;tracker programs&quot; wherein videographers use candidates&#x27; itineraries to track them and record as many remarks as possible, since anything they say can and will be used against them, as was the case in former Senator George Allen&#x27;s &quot;macaca moment.&quot; In the 2006 election cycle, a Virginia senator, George Allen, was unseated because of videotape of the senator calling a videographer/opposition researcher a &quot;macaca&quot; or monkey. The name was considered to be an ethnic slur, and Allen&#x27;s campaign could not overcome the damage when the incident was broadcast widely in mainstream media and on the internet.

=== Digital media and Wikipedia ===
A 2005 analysis of digital media strategies published by the American Academy of Political Science took the view that new technologies enable &quot;political elites&quot; to use database and Internet technologies to do opposition research more easily, but they use data-mining techniques that outrage privacy advocates and surreptitious technologies that few Internet users understand. Data becomes &quot;richer&quot; about political actors, policy options, and the diversity of actors and opinion in the public sphere, but citizenship is &quot;thinner&quot; by virtue of &quot;the ease in which people can become politically expressive without being substantively engaged.&quot;

Facebook photos became a tool of opposition researchers in California&#x27;s 32nd congressional district special election, 2009 to replace Hilda Solis. Front-runner Democrat Gil Cedillo sent out mailers targeting 26-year-old Emanuel Pleitez, grouping Pleitez&#x27;s Facebook photos to suggest that he parties to excess with alcohol, and fraternizes with gangs. The text of the mailer suggested Pleitez, posing with a Latino stage actress and using a Latino voter registration drive hand sign, was &quot;flashing gang signs&quot;.

In 2006, the campaign manager of Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Cathy Cox, Morton Brilliant, resigned after Cox&#x27;s opponent, Lt. Gov, Mark Taylor, revealed Cox&#x27;s campaign had added information from an opposition research dossier to a Wikipedia page on Taylor. Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales confirmed that the material had come from an IP address affiliated with the Cox campaign. Citing an Associated Press analysis, CNN reported that Wikipedia being used as a &quot;popular tool&quot; for opposition researchers became so widespread a problem that Wikipedia altered its submission guidelines and set up alerts so that its operators know when Capitol Hill staffers alter Wikipedia content. However, anyone who wanted to could simply bypass this by using an IP address not associated with Capitol Hill.

===Grassroot campaigns===
Opposition research is a necessary component of grassroots activist groups. Research on corporate or political opponents may enable activist groups to target neighborhoods from which to increase their numbers, to refine their focus or &quot;target&quot;, to pinpoint the target&#x27;s vulnerabilities, to reveal hidden sources of funding or little-known connections, to investigate scare tactics, and to augment a legislative initiative.

In the presidential election of 2008, the blog Talking Points Memo pioneered &quot;collaborative citizen-reporting projects&quot; based on groups of volunteers examining public documents that shed light on the George W. Bush administration&#x27;s U.S. attorneys firings controversy. Other organizations such as the Sunlight Foundation encouraged citizen examination of such public domain records as Mitt Romney&#x27;s financial disclosure statements and Bill Clinton&#x27;s income statements.

===Preventive measures===
Political strategies for campaigns often include coaching on preventive measures to avoid providing too much information in public disclosure procedures that can provide ammunition for opponents&#x27; opposition researchers, particularly in itemized expenditure reports. &quot;To eliminate some of these potential issues your campaign should take the time to review the wording of your campaign finance reports&quot;, advises one strategist writing for &quot;The Hill&quot;:

Instead of reporting that you spent $3,000 on a &#x27;background check and public records search on Congressman X,&#x27; list the expenditure as &#x27;issue research&#x27; or simply &#x27;research&#x27;... One bonus financial filing tip: warn your candidate about spending campaign funds on fancy restaurants for &#x27;strategy meetings.&#x27; Eating at Ruth&#x27;s Chris or Morton&#x27;s Steak House on your campaign&#x27;s dime just looks bad. The press may poke a little fun at your candidate&#x27;s expense; your donors may feel their donation in being misspent and may never give again. 

===Funding and institutions===
Congressional and presidential opposition research is often conducted by or funded by a political party, lobbying group, political action committee (PAC), or a 527 group that coalesces around a certain issue. In the U.S., both the Republican and Democratic parties employ full-time &quot;Directors of Research&quot; and maintain databases on opponents. In recent years the task of opposition research has been privatized in many areas. Full-time companies with permanent staff specializing in media productions or &quot;grassroots&quot; operations have replaced volunteers and campaign officials. Political media consultants may also opt for astroturfing techniques, which simulate wide popular appeal for a candidate&#x27;s platform.

== Australia ==
In October 2011, a media storm erupted in Australia over the leaking of &#x27;dirt files&#x27; compiled by the Liberal National Party and further revelations that a former Australian Labor Party operative had been engaged to help compile the dossiers.

Despite protestations that key party personnel had no knowledge of the dossiers it was later revealed a Liberal National Party opposition research strategist had been compiling the files as part of a SWOT analysis at previous elections which formed the basis of negative attack messaging for a &#x27;rapid response unit&#x27;.

== South Africa ==
In January 2017, the African National Congress (ANC) was exposed when Sihle Bolani filed an affidavit in the Johannesburg High Court, demanding payment for her part in project War Room. The War Room&#x27;s mandate was to &quot;disempower DA and EFF campaigns&quot; and set a pro-ANC agenda using a range of media, without revealing the ANC&#x27;s hand.

== United States ==

=== Presidential elections ===
Opponents of Andrew Jackson in the 1824 and 1828 presidential elections unearthed his marriage records to imply that he was an adulterer for marrying Rachel Robards before she was legally divorced from her first husband. Jackson had married her in 1791 on the strength of a statement from her husband that he had divorced her; Jackson had two wedding ceremonies, the not-recognizable one of 1791 and the legally corrective one of 1794. His political opponents used this information decades later against him, and he fought many duels over his wife&#x27;s honor. Rachel Robards died before Jackson took office in his first term; he maintained that the stress of the opposition had killed her.

In 1858, William Herndon, the law partner of Abraham Lincoln, did research in the Illinois State Library to collect &quot;all the ammunition Mr. Lincoln saw fit to gather&quot; to prepare for the run against Stephen A. Douglas in the 1860 presidential race.

In preparation for Ronald Reagan&#x27;s debate with President Jimmy Carter in the presidential race 1980, Reagan&#x27;s campaign staff acquired under mysterious circumstances a 200-page briefing book, including information on Carter&#x27;s strategy, which staffers David Stockman and David Gergen had used to prepare Reagan. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department investigated to see how the information had been obtained by the Reagan camp. Two law professors filed suit in federal district court in Washington to request a special investigation, based on the 1978 Ethics in Government Act. Carter&#x27;s staff believed the book to have been stolen from the White House, but the inquiry did not uncover any credible evidence that any law had been violated. The House of Representatives conducted its own investigation, and concluded in a 2,314-page report that the Reagan staff had two copies of the book, one from Reagan&#x27;s campaign director William J. Casey, future head of the Central Intelligence Agency. James Baker attributed the acquisition of the documents to Casey, who claimed to know nothing about them, and an analysis of Carter campaign documents found in the &quot;Afghanistan&quot; files of Reagan aide David Gergen indicated they came from three White House offices: the National Security Council, Vice President Walter Mondale and Domestic Adviser Stuart Eizenstat. Many years afterward, Carter himself stated in a PBS interview that the book had been taken by columnist George Will, but Will denied it, calling Carter &quot;a recidivist liar.&quot;

Lee Atwater is considered to be the &quot;father&quot; of modern aggressive &quot;oppo&quot; techniques. Atwater honed his style working in his native South Carolina for Senator Strom Thurmond and to elect Congressman (later Governor) Carroll Campbell. From his posts on the 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, Atwater encouraged and helped direct what was then the advanced oppo work of the Republican National Committee against Democrats Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis. During the 1988 presidential campaign, dozens of RNC researchers worked three shifts around the clock to feed the then-burgeoning 24-hour news cycle. The now-infamous &quot;Willie Horton&quot; TV ads crafted by Floyd Brown helped turn voters away from Dukakis and towards the Republican, although Atwater and Bush were protected by plausible deniability because Brown&#x27;s ads were independently funded and produced. Academic research into the Bush archives decades later revealed that a Bush staffer, Candice Strother, had released a dossier of information on Willie Horton to Elizabeth Fediay, of the non-profit group that contracted for the ad. (The Horton story had been completely public for an entire year, part of news coverage that won a Pulitzer Prize for the Lawrence (Massachusetts) &quot;Eagle-Tribune&quot; newspaper.) Willie Horton was an African-American convicted murderer released on a weekend furlough during Governor Dukakis&#x27;s tenure, who escaped and committed a brutal rape in Maryland, also stabbing his victim&#x27;s husband. Atwater is also credited with originating &quot;push polls&quot; and &quot;whisper campaigns&quot; that use disinformation strategies to alienate voters from opponents. A biography of Atwater, quotes him as saying in an interview toward the end of his life that he regretted some of his less ethical techniques.

In the 1992 presidential campaign, Republicans reported that they spent $6 million on a &quot;state of the art (opposition research) war machine&quot; to investigate Bill Clinton, who was running against George H. W. Bush. In the same election, the Clinton campaign paid more than $100,000 to a private investigator to look into allegations about Clinton&#x27;s womanizing, investigating more than two dozen women.

In the 2000 presidential election, longtime opposition researcher and Nixon loyalist Roger Stone was recruited by former Secretary of State James Baker to oversee the recount of the disputed Presidential election in Miami-Dade County in 2000. Stone is credited with organizing the street demonstrations and eventual shut-down of the recount in that pivotal county.

In the 2004 presidential race, Chris Lehane, a Democratic opposition researcher attracted notoriety and built a reputation not for deploying his skills against Republican opponents, but for using them against other Democrats in the primary races. Working for retired Army general Wesley Clark, Lehane sought to establish a media &quot;narrative&quot; that Howard Dean was hypocritical and dishonest, based on surveys of his administrative archive as governor of Vermont.

A protege of Atwater&#x27;s, Karl Rove, is considered to be the &quot;architect&quot; of George W. Bush&#x27;s election to the governor&#x27;s office in Texas, and to the presidency in 2000 and 2004. In the 2000 race, Rove is credited with masterminding the push poll that initiated the &quot;John McCain has a black love child&quot; whisper campaign in South Carolina. Anonymous telephone pollsters, upon determining that a voter was pro-McCain, asked the question, &quot;Would you be more or less likely to vote for John McCain if you knew he had fathered a black child out of wedlock?&quot; The question was not overt slander, but it prompted the president of Bob Jones University to launch his own internet campaign against McCain, and succeeded in crippling the trust of voters McCain had attracted. The Bush camp knew, as the general public did not, that in reality, John McCain was the adoptive father of a dark-skinned Bangladeshi refugee who was rescued by his wife Cindi.

In the 2008 presidential election, opposition researchers for Barack Obama unearthed the fact that John Edwards had paid $400 for haircuts at campaign expense, and supplied Politico&#x27;s Ben Smith with the tip, according to a memoir later published by campaign manager David Plouffe. Though the Democratic National Committee continues to fund a research department, after the 2008 presidential election, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;The legacy of the Democratic National Committee itself is hardly clear going forward. Mr. Obama effectively subsumed all the responsibilities in his campaign: fundraising, voter turn-out and opposition research.

=== U.S. executive examples ===
* Franklin Roosevelt Administration: In 1940, the White House accidentally taped a conversation of President Franklin D. Roosevelt instructing a lower level aide to disseminate a rumor about his opponent Wendell Willkie having an extramarital affair: &quot;We can&#x27;t have any of our principal speakers refer to it, but the people down the line can get it out.&quot;
* Johnson Administration: In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson sent 30 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents to the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, N.J., to avert assassination attempts, and to monitor his political rival Robert F. Kennedy and civil rights activists. Johnson later also placed his Republican challenger, Barry Goldwater, under FBI surveillance, with a federal wiretap.
* Nixon Administration: During the Richard Nixon administration, White House staffers compiled lists of names of political opponents, journalists who had criticized Nixon, and artists and actors (such as Jane Fonda and Paul Newman) who had dissented with Nixon policy, especially on the subject of Vietnam, with the intent of prompting Internal Revenue Service investigations. The full extent of Nixon&#x27;s surveillance of private citizens solely on the basis of their dissent was not known until years after Nixon was forced to resign, as former staff members such as Charles Colson and John Dean began to disclose details. Nixon&#x27;s Enemies List is the informal name of what started as a list of President Richard Nixon&#x27;s major political opponents compiled by Charles Colson, written by George T. Bell [1] (assistant to Colson, special counsel to the White House) and sent in memorandum form to John Dean on September 9, 1971. The list was part of a campaign officially known as &quot;Opponents List&quot; and &quot;Political Enemies Project.&quot; The official purpose, as described by the White House Counsel&#x27;s Office, was to &quot;screw&quot; Nixon&#x27;s political enemies, by means of tax audits from the IRS, and by manipulating &quot;grant availability, federal contracts, litigation, prosecution, etc.&quot;
* Ford Administration: During the Gerald Ford presidency, Deputy Assistant Dick Cheney suggested in a now-infamous memo to Donald Rumsfeld that the White House use the United States Justice Department to conduct opposition research and retaliate against political opponents and critical journalists such as Seymour Hersh and The New York Times, arguing that the executive branch had the power to prosecute journalists as they saw fit, under the provisions of the Espionage Act of 1917.
* Reagan Administration: In 1984, during the Ronald Reagan presidency, the Republican National Committee formed The Opposition Research Group, with its own budget of $1.1 million. These staff amassed information on eight Democratic presidential candidates based on data from voting records, Congressional Record speeches, media clippings and transcripts, campaign materials, all of which was stored on a computer for easy access. In this way the Reagan team was able to track inconsistencies and attack them. This original data base evolved into a network that linked information gleaned by Republicans in all 50 states, creating a master data base accessible to high-ranking Republican staff, even aboard Air Force One. Though this RNC database was accessible to both the Reagan White House and campaign team, no evidence has surfaced that U.S. federal dollars funded The Opposition Research Group or its efforts.
* Clinton Administration: During the Bill Clinton administration, the &quot;Filegate&quot; scandal erupted when White House staffers said to be acting on the directions of First Lady Hillary Clinton improperly accessed 500 FBI files compiled for security checks of Reagan and Bush staffers in previous administrations. Craig Livingstone, said to be hired by Mrs. Clinton with dubious credentials, resigned amid public outcry. In testimony under oath during the Kenneth Starr special prosecutor&#x27;s investigation, Mrs. Clinton stated that she had neither hired Livingstone nor improperly perused the files.
* George W. Bush Administration: Two former opposition researchers for the RNC appointed to Justice Department posts, Timothy Griffin and Monica Goodling, were implicated in efforts to use data collected on Democratic-appointed federal attorneys as ground for dismissal. Also during this administration, Counterintelligence Field Activity (CIFA), an intelligence gathering arm of the Pentagon was disbanded in 2008, after investigations into the bribery activities directed at Duke Cunningham revealed that the U.S. government kept a sizeable database of information about 126 domestic peace activist groups, including Quakers, about 1,500 &quot;suspicious incidents&quot; including peace demonstrations outside armed forces recruiter offices, even though the groups posed no specified threat to national security. The program was known as Talon. About two years elapsed between the program&#x27;s disbanding and the &quot;Post&quot; report. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; quoted an unnamed &quot;official&quot; as saying, &quot;On the surface, it looks like things in the database that were determined not to be viable threats were never deleted but should have been&quot;, the official said. &quot;You can also make the argument that these things should never have been put in the database in the first place until they were confirmed as threats.&quot;
* Barack Obama Administration: In February 2009, Shauna Daly, a former opposition researcher for the Democratic National Committee was appointed as a researcher for the White House&#x27;s Office of Legal Counsel. Daly was Barack Obama&#x27;s deputy research director during the presidential campaign, spent much of the cycle rebutting viral online attacks on Obama&#x27;s character and biography under the rubric of &quot;Stop the Smears.&quot; Shortly thereafter, amid speculations that she would be conducting research against political opponents, she was reassigned as Research Director to the DNC. Politico.com reported on February 27, 2009 that &quot;the counsel&#x27;s office – which doesn&#x27;t face the sort of rapid-response demands that were common in the late Clinton years – doesn&#x27;t plan to fill the research post.&quot; &quot;The American Spectator&quot; reported on its &quot;Washington Prowler&quot; blog that Daly was posted in the White House Counsel&#x27;s Office for &quot;about a month&quot;, and thus had access to &quot;reams of Bush administration documents related to such things as the firings of U.S. Attorney, the use and internal debate over the USA PATRIOT Act, FISA and the Scooter Libby and Karl Rove investigations. The &quot;Prowler&quot; quoted &quot;a DNC staffer&quot; as saying, &quot;She realized that she could do more with all the material she saw outside of the building than inside where she&#x27;d be bound by the rules and legalities of the White House Counsel&#x27;s Office. Now she isn&#x27;t. She&#x27;s good at what she does; her time at the White House means we&#x27;ve got a mother load (&quot;sic&quot;) of material that will have Republicans scrambling. At least that&#x27;s what we hope.&quot;

=== U.S. Supreme Court examples ===
In 1916, after President Woodrow Wilson nominated Louis Brandeis for the Supreme Court, &quot;concerned&quot; citizens seeking to block his confirmation offered information that Brandeis was a &quot;radical Zionist&quot;, even though he was not a practicing Jew. Brandeis aggressively outmaneuvered his detractors by mounting his own opposition research efforts, including a carefully constructed chart that exposed the social and financial connections of the group, mostly from Boston&#x27;s Back Bay, and including Harvard president Lawrence Lowell, as well as a group headed by former President William Howard Taft and a host of American Bar Association past presidents. Brandeis sent the chart to Walter Lippmann at the &quot;New Republic&quot; who penned an editorial condemning &quot;the most homogeneous, self-centered, and self-complacent community in the United States.&quot; Brandeis was confirmed after four months of hearings, in a Senate vote of 47–22.

Ronald Reagan nominated Judge Robert Bork for appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1987, prompting a Senate floor speech from Democratic Massachusetts senator Ted Kennedy, which later became known as the &quot;Robert Bork&#x27;s America&quot; speech:

Kennedy&#x27;s speech prompted a rapid-response opposition research effort from Democrats, but the White House waited two and a half months to respond. The Senate Judiciary Committee, under the direction of Delaware senator and presidential hopeful Joseph Biden, commissioned a report in response to the materials Reagan&#x27;s staff had released in support of Bork&#x27;s nomination. Prepared by a panel of lawyers, including two Duke University law professors, the 78-page became known as &quot;The Biden Report.&quot; The report detailed Bork&#x27;s record, and analyzed the pattern of his rulings, and deeming him to be a conservative &quot;activist&quot; rather than an impartial jurist. Ultimately, Bork&#x27;s embattled nomination failed, and Anthony Kennedy (no relation to Ted) was later confirmed to fill the position. The fierce research-based opposition to Bork&#x27;s nomination attracted significant media attention, even though a Gallup Poll on the eve of the confirmation vote showed that very few Americans could name the nominee in question, much less recall his rulings. A new verb was later coined; &quot;to bork&quot; a candidate or nominee by mounting such voluminous research and vocal opposition that the person in question would be forced to withdraw.

After President George W. Bush nominated Harriet Miers to the U.S. Supreme Court, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reported that Republican conservative advocacy groups were conducting opposition research against her: &quot;Groups are circulating lists of questions they want members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to ask Miers at her confirmation hearings. The activists&#x27; thinly veiled hope is that Miers will reveal ignorance of the law and give senators a reason to oppose her.&quot; Miers later withdrew her name from consideration for the court.

On July 7, 2005, soon after the resignation of Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, the Democratic National Committee gathered and circulated information on the &quot;anti-civil rights&quot; and &quot;anti-immigrant&quot; rulings of Samuel Alito, by then nominated by President George W. Bush to replace her. Upon inspection, the documents were revealed to have been amended by Devorah Adler, research director for the DNC. Alito&#x27;s &quot;record&quot; had been pointedly altered to present him in a negative light. While the incident was not unusual, it received publicity in prominent places because it drew attention to the &quot;meta-data&quot; that is often unwittingly stored in documents that are altered and forwarded electronically.

On May 2, 2009, after Supreme Court Justice David Souter announced his intent to retire from the court, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Curt Levey, executive director of the Committee for Justice, had noted that conservatives were &quot;focusing opposition research efforts on 17 women, whom they have divided into two tiers based on their perceived chances.&quot;

=== U.S. states ===

Seven aides to members of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives pleaded guilty on January 7, 2010, to illegal use of state resources for campaign activities, including opposition research against the political opponents of incumbent officeholders during 2007. These seven were Democrats; a total of 25 indictments have been handed down to a mix of Democrats and Republican politicians.

During Lamar Alexander&#x27;s 2002 campaign for the U.S. Senate, Alexander&#x27;s campaign staff received an anonymous mailing of a photograph of opponent Bob Clement obviously serving as a board member of a failed bank whose owners had been imprisoned for bank fraud. When the Alexander campaign raised the issue of Clement&#x27;s financial ties with the convicted felons, Clement denied any connection. When the Alexander campaign produced the photograph as evidence, Clement claimed his role was only an informal advisory one.

In early July 2009 Alaska governor Sarah Palin announced that she would be resigning as governor, partly due to complications from opposition research and ethics inquiries after her inclusion on the 2008 GOP presidential race ballot as John McCain&#x27;s running mate. At a later news conference Palin told reporters, &quot;Obviously conditions had changed so drastically on August 29, the day I was tapped to be VP&quot;, she said. &quot;The opposition research and the games that began there — which I think is the new normal in Alaska politics, until I hand the reins over to Sean Parnell — have been so distracting.&quot;

In the Pennsylvania state legislature in July 2009, former state House Democratic Campaign Committee Chair, Rep. Stephen Stetler found himself amidst an investigation when he rejected a plan that would have shifted the job of opposition research from employees on the state payroll to private firms. Attorney General Tom Corbett alleged that millions in public funds were paid to state employees who did such research on the 2006 and 2004 campaigns of Democrats in the state. Stetler left the House after 2006 to become the state&#x27;s revenue secretary. A former aide, Dan Wiedemer testified before grand jurors that the suggestion to remove politically motivated research from the hands of public employees &quot;was more or less shot down.&quot; Though Stetler has not been charged, 12 former House members and members of their staff were charged with diverting public funds for political campaign work. Stetler was among those subpoenaed, said Chuck Ardo, a spokesman for Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell. The hearing will be held before President Judge Richard Lewis in September.

==Mass media ethics==

The practice of using tips from opposition research sources was examined in 1994 by Howard Kurtz, media analyst for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Kurtz surveyed the major networks, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and other influential media outlets, and found varying levels of use of oppo research information on David Hale as a witness in the Whitewater controversy. At this time, Brown confirmed that he had been the source of four mainstream media stories that had received attention from the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; because they bore striking resemblance to the opposition research being disseminated by Citizens United.

&quot;Far from being detached observers, reporters constantly call oppo staffs looking for tidbits and sometimes trading information&quot;, wrote three reporters, Matthew Cooper, Gloria Borger, and Michael Barone, for &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in 1992.

==Political infighting==
In spring 2007, Roger Stone, a political consultant in the employ of New York state senator Joseph Bruno, resigned after leaving threatening phone messages on the answering machine of the 85-year-old father of New York Governor Eliot Spitzer, alleging that Spitzer&#x27;s campaign finances were conducted improperly. In November of that same year, Stone sent a letter to the FBI detailing Spitzer&#x27;s sexual preferences with prostitutes and sexual props, right down to his black calf-length socks. Stone was considered to be an authoritative source because he frequented the same prostitutes himself as a client. A subsequent Justice Department investigation produced evidence that ultimately led to Spitzer&#x27;s resignation as governor. Bruno, Stone&#x27;s client, has been a longtime political enemy of Spitzer.

<text>Gheorghe Marinescu (; 28 February 1863 – 15 May 1938) was a Romanian neurologist, founder of the Romanian School of Neurology.

==History==
After attending the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Bucharest, Marinescu received most of his medical education as preparator at the laboratory of histology at the Brâncoveanu Hospital and as assistant at the Bacteriological Institute under Victor Babeș, who had already published several works on myelitis transversa, hysterical muteness, and dilatation of the pupil in pneumonia.

==Career==
After qualification, and on the recommendation of Babeş, the government awarded Marinescu a grant to undertake postgraduate training in neurology under Jean-Martin Charcot at the Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, where he met Pierre Marie, Joseph Babinski, and Fulgence Raymond. Later, he worked with Carl Weigert in Frankfurt and then with Emil du Bois-Reymond in Berlin. On the assignment of Pierre Marie, he lectured on the pathological anatomy of acromegaly at the Berlin International Congress in 1890.

After nine years abroad, Marinescu returned in 1897 to Bucharest, where he received his doctorate and began a new professorial department at Pantelimon Hospital which had been created for him. Shortly thereafter, in 1897, a chair of Clinical Neurology was created at the University of Bucharest, in Colentina Hospital. He remained in this post for the next 41 years and is regarded as the founder of the Romanian School of Neurology. He was elected a titular member of the Romanian Academy in 1905.

Between July 1898 and 1901, Marinescu made the first science films in the world in his clinic in Bucharest: &quot;The walking troubles of organic hemiplegy&quot; (1898), &quot;The walking troubles of organic paraplegies&quot; (1899), &quot;A case of hysteric hemiplegy healed through hypnosis&quot; (1899), &quot;The walking troubles of progressive locomotion ataxy&quot; (1900) and &quot;Illnesses of the muscles&quot; (1901). All these short subjects have been preserved. The professor called his works &quot;studies with the help of the cinematograph&quot;, and published the results, along with several consecutive frames, in issues of the magazine &quot;La Semaine Médicale&quot; from Paris, between 1899 and 1902. In 1924, Auguste Lumière recognized the priority of professor Marinescu concerning the first science films: &quot;I&#x27;ve seen your scientific reports about the usage of cinematograph in studies of nervous illnesses, when I was still receiving &quot;La Semaine Médicale&quot;, but back then I had other concerns, which left me no spare time to begin biological studies. I must say I forgot those works and I am thankful to you that you reminded them to me. Unfortunately, not many scientists have followed your way.&quot; In 1935, he became the founding chairman of the Royal Romanian Society for Heredity and Eugenics, which sought to popularize eugenics and promote forced sterilization.

==Legacy==

Marinescu maintained close academic links with his Parisian colleagues and many of his articles, which exceeded 250 in number, were published in French. He had a wide range of research interests, including pathological anatomy and experimental neuropathology. Daily contact with scores of the infirm and his astuteness made him use the latest methods as they became available, such as the X-ray, with which he investigated bone changes in acromegaly, and the film camera, for the study of body movements in health and disease. The results of these studies appeared in the monograph &quot;Le Tonus des Muscles striés&quot; (1937) with Nicolae Ionescu-Siseşti, Oskar Sager and Arthur Kreindler, with a preface by Sir Charles Scott Sherrington.

Early in his career, Marinescu published a much needed atlas on the pathological histology of the nervous system with the bacteriologist Victor Babeş and the French pathologist Paul Oscar Blocq. His description with Blocq, of a case of Parkinsonian tremor due to tumour in the &quot;substantia nigra&quot; in 1893, was the basis for Édouard Brissaud&#x27;s theory that Parkinsonism occurs as a consequence of damage to the &quot;substantia nigra&quot;. With Blocq he was the first to describe senile plaques and with Romanian neurologist Ion Minea he confirmed in 1913 Hideyo Noguchi&#x27;s discovery of &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot; in the brain in patients with general paresis. His monumental work &quot;La Cellule Nerveuse&quot;, with a preface by Santiago Ramon y Cajal, appeared in 1909.

Marinescu was an eminent teacher. In his lectures he emphasised ideas and gave perspective for further investigations. Recognition in the form of honours came to him from many countries. It was he above all others who was chosen to represent the students of Charcot when the centenary of the great master was celebrated in 1925.

<text>Clark McConachy (15 April 1895 – 12 April 1980), often known simply as Mac, was a New Zealand professional player of English billiards and snooker.

==Life and career==
McConachy was born at Glenorchy in Otago in 1895. He was the New Zealand professional billiards champion from 1914 until 1980.

He was runner-up in the Professional Billiards Championship to Joe Davis in 1932, and became champion in 1951 by defeating John Barrie 9,274-6,691. He also held the title unchallenged from 1951 until 1968, when at the age of 73 and afflicted by Parkinson&#x27;s disease, he was narrowly defeated 5,234-5,499 by Rex Williams. His highest break at billiards was 1,943.

He was the runner-up in the World Snooker Championships of 1932 (losing to Davis, as he did in that year&#x27;s world billiards championship) and 1952. McConachy scored one of the early snooker maximum breaks. He achieved it on Tuesday 19 February 1952 in a practice frame against Pat Kitchen at the Beaufort Club in London on a table reserved for professionals. An official of the Billiards Association and Control Council later examined the table and found it slightly over the standard size and so the break was not accepted as official. At the time Joe Davis held the record for the highest official break of 146. The match between McConachy and Horace Lindrum for the World Championship started the following Monday.

McConachy was a keen advocate of physical fitness and regularly ran up to four miles every day. A strict teetotaller and non-smoker, he attributed his continued success well into his senior years to these things. He was also well known for walking around the table on his hands before the match started. He is a member of the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame. In the 1964 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for community and charitable services. He died at his residence in the Auckland suburb of Greenlane on 12 April 1980.

<text>A is a Shinto shrine in which Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543–1616), the founder of the Tokugawa shogunate, is enshrined. Tōshō-gūs are found throughout Japan. 

The most well-known Tōshō-gū is the Nikkō Tōshō-gū located in Nikkō, Tochigi Prefecture. It is one of Japan&#x27;s most popular destinations for tourists and is part of &quot;Shrines and Temples of Nikkō&quot; World Heritage Site.

Ueno Tōshō-gū at Ueno Park in Tokyo is also widely known. The Kunōzan Tōshō-gū is in Shizuoka Prefecture and rivals Nikkō&#x27;s for decorative splendor. Another one is the Nagoya Tōshō-gū, constructed in 1619. A Tōshō-gū can also be found at Miyanochō, in Sendai.

During the Edo period these shrines reached 500 in number, but after the Meiji Restoration many were abandoned, and others united with shrines in the area. Presently, it is estimated that there are about 130 Tōshō-gū. The National Tōshō-gū Association lists a total of 48 shrines.

Ieyasu was deified with the name , meaning &quot;Great Gongen, Light of the East&quot; (a &quot;gongen&quot; is a Buddha who has appeared on Earth in the form of a &quot;kami&quot; to save sentient beings), and this is what gives &quot;Tōshō-gū&quot; shrines their name.

<text>Masaru Ibuka (井深 大 &quot;Ibuka Masaru&quot;; April 11, 1908 – December 19, 1997) was a Japanese electronics industrialist and co-founder of Sony, along with Akio Morita.

==Early life==
Masaru Ibuka was born on April 11, 1908, as the first son of Tasuku Ibuka, an architectural technologist and a student of Inazo Nitobe. His ancestral family were chief retainers of the Aizu Domain, and his relatives include Yae Ibuka and Ibuka Kajinosuke. Masaru lost his father at the age of two and was taken over by his grandfather. He later moved to Kobe after his mother remarried. He passed the entrance exam to Hyogo Prefectural 1st Kobe Boys&#x27; School (now, Hyogo Prefectural Kobe High School) and was very happy about this success.

== Career ==
After graduating from Waseda University in 1933, Masaru went to work at Photo-Chemical Laboratory, a company which processed movie film, and later served in the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II where he was a member of the Imperial Navy Wartime Research Committee. In September 1945, he left the company and navy, and founded a radio repair shop in the bombed out Shirokiya Department Store in Nihonbashi, Tokyo.

In 1946, a fellow wartime researcher, Akio Morita, saw a newspaper article about Ibuka&#x27;s new venture and after some correspondence, chose to join him in Tokyo. With funding from Morita&#x27;s father, they co-founded Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation, which became known as Sony Corporation in 1958. Ibuka was instrumental in securing the licensing of transistor technology from Bell Labs to Sony in the 1950s, thus making Sony one of the first companies to apply transistor technology to non-military uses. He also led the research and development team that developed Sony&#x27;s Trinitron color television in 1967. Ibuka served as president of Sony from 1950 to 1971, and then served as chairman of Sony from 1971 until he retired in 1976.

Ibuka was awarded the Medal of Honor with Blue Ribbon in 1960, and was decorated with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure in 1978 and with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun in 1986. He was further decorated as a Commander First Class of the Royal Order of the Polar Star of Sweden in that year, named a Person of Cultural Merit in 1989 and decorated with the Order of Culture in 1992.

Ibuka received Honorary Doctorates from Sophia University, Tokyo in 1976, from Waseda University, Tokyo in 1979, and from Brown University (US) in 1994. The IEEE awarded him the IEEE Founders Medal in 1972 and named the IEEE Masaru Ibuka Consumer Electronics Award after him in 1987.

Ibuka served as the Chairman of the National Board of Governors of the Boy Scouts of Nippon. In 1991 the World Organization of the Scout Movement awarded him the Bronze Wolf. In 1989 he also received the highest distinction of the Scout Association of Japan, the Golden Pheasant Award.

Other awards: 1964, Distinguished Services Award from the Institute of Electrical Communication Engineers of Japan; 1981, Humanism and Technology Award from the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies; 1986, Eduard Rhein Ring of Honor, German Eduard Rhein Foundation; 1989, Designated Person of Cultural Merits by Ministry of Education; 1991, The Presidential Award and Medallion from the University of Illinois.

Ibuka also authored the book &quot;Kindergarten is Too Late&quot; (1971), in which he claims that the most significant human learning occurs from birth to 3 years old and suggests ways and means to take advantage of this. The book&#x27;s foreword was written by Glenn Doman, founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, an organization that teaches parents about child brain development.

==Death==
Ibuka died of heart failure in 1989 at age 89. He was survived by a son and two daughters.

<text>was a Japanese author. His novel &quot;Black Rain,&quot; about the bombing of Hiroshima, was awarded the Noma Prize and the Order of Cultural Merit.

==Early life and education==
Ibuse was born in 1898 to a landowning family in the village of , now part of Fukuyama, Hiroshima.

Ibuse failed his entrance exam to Hiroshima Middle School, but in 1911 he gained admission to Fukuyama Middle School. Fukuyama Middle School was an elite academy and was linked to eminent scholars. Fukuyama&#x27;s teachers boasted about the school&#x27;s pedigree, but Ibuse was unconcerned. Ibuse spoke of this school as following Western ideals; in &quot;The First Half of My Life&quot;, he said that the school emphasized Dutch learning and French military exercises. Ibuse was made fun of at this school, and he avoided wearing glasses in an effort to avoid ridicule.

Although Ibuse enjoyed the Western influences in his education, his grandfather arranged for a private tutorial in Chinese literature. However, this training stopped when Ibuse&#x27;s tutor died. His school often forbade students from reading fictional literature, which prevented Ibuse from reading many popular works during this period. 

However, Ibuse did read works by Shimazaki Toson and Mori Ogai. In 1916, Ibuse wrote a letter to Ogai using the pseudonym Kuchiki Sansuke. Ogai believed Sansuke was a famous scholar and sent a reply to Sansuke expressing his gratitude. While in middle school, Ibuse&#x27;s brother Fumio submitted a poem to the Tokyo journal &quot;Shusai Bundan&quot; using Ibuse&#x27;s name. Ibuse was reprimanded by the principal of Fukuyama Middle School, but he was also praised. He received two fan letters. 

The reprimand Ibuse received influenced him to express an interest in the visual arts. Ibuse studied the arts at Fukuyama Middle School. He enjoyed the classes but did not feel he wanted to commit his life to becoming an artist. Ibuse graduated from middle school in 1917. Afterwards he sought to continue his artistic endeavours under the tutorship of established painter Hashimoto Kansetsu, but Kansetsu denied him this opportunity.

==University education==
In 1917, at nineteen years of age, Ibuse began studying at Waseda University in Tokyo. His choice was greatly influenced by his brother Fumio and by a friend of his, Yamane Masakazu. Ibuse was initially interested in studying poetry and painting but was encouraged to study fiction and ended up specialising in French literature.

Upon moving to Tokyo, Ibuse was ambivalent about leaving the countryside of Fukuyama and moving to the big city. Ibuse described this experience in &quot;Thoughts One February Ninth&quot;: &quot;sometimes I feel that half of me wants to return to the country while the other half would like to cling to Tokyo until the very end.&quot; Tokyo appeared surreal to Ibuse. He felt lonely and missed his Fukuyama home. Nevertheless, Ibuse decided to stay in a boardinghouse near Waseda University. He often moved but always stayed near Waseda and visited Fukuyama only occasionally.

During his stay at Waseda University, Ibuse witnessed political unrest and radicalism of university students. However, the political ideologies of the era did not appeal to Ibuse. He was dissatisfied with the continual strikes and revolts. In Tokyo, Ibuse befriended eccentric young men and literary hopefuls but often found inspiration in his loneliness and encounters with Geisha. He went so far as to pawn a watch to try to understand the needfulness of writers.

In 1918, Ibuse met naturalist writer Iwano Homei. Homei&#x27;s literature appealed to Ibuse and later influenced some of Ibuse&#x27;s literary works. Ibuse also befriended student Aoki Nampachi at Waseda. Aoki was a mentor and a great influence on the writings of Ibuse. Aoki&#x27;s influence can be found in &quot;The Carp&quot;, where Ibuse idealizes Aoki&#x27;s friendship and represents his feelings towards this friendship as a carp. Ibuse was also influenced by the works of Shakespeare and Bashō, as well as by French literature. Ibuse&#x27;s first literary works were in prose, and he started writing his first essays in 1922 shortly after the death of Aoki.

Ibuse witnessed one of his professors, Noburu Katagami, an epileptic, at the onset of a seizure. Following quarrels with two of his professors and the incident with Katagami, Ibuse withdrew from both Waseda and art school. Embarrassed, Katagami campaigned against Ibuse&#x27;s readmission to Waseda University.

==Literary career==
Ibuse began publishing stories in the early 1920s. One of his first contributions was to the magazine &quot;Seiki&quot;. It was originally written for Aoki in 1919 and titled &quot;The Salamander&quot;. In 1923 it was renamed &quot;Confinement&quot;. Ibuse began to be recognised in the late 1920s, when his work was favorably mentioned by some of Japan&#x27;s top critics. With the publication of &quot;Salamander&quot; in 1929, he began to write in a style characterized by a unique blend of humour and bitterness.

He was awarded the Naoki Prize for &quot;John Manjirou, the Cast-Away: his Life and Adventure&quot; and continued to publish works filled with warmth and kindness, while at the same time showing keen powers of observation. The themes he employed were usually intellectual fantasies that used animal allegories, historical fiction, and the country life.

During World War II Ibuse worked for the government as a propaganda writer.

Ibuse was known and appreciated for most of his career, although it wasn&#x27;t until after the war that he became famous. He won the inaugural Yomiuri Prize in 1949 for &quot;&quot;. In 1966 he published his novel &quot;Black Rain&quot;, which won him international acclaim and several awards including the Noma Prize and the Order of Cultural Merit, the highest honor that can be bestowed upon a Japanese author. The novel draws its material from the bombing of Hiroshima and the title refers to the nuclear fallout. Ibuse was not present at the time of the bombing, but he used the diaries of survivors to construct his narrative. An earlier story by Ibuse, &quot;Kakitsubata&quot; (&quot;The Crazy Iris&quot;, first published in 1951), deals with similar themes.

Ibuse died in a hospital at Tokyo on July 10, 1993 of pneumonia.

<doc id="738229" wikidata="Q1847828" url="?curid=738229" title="Migdol">
<text>Migdol, or migdal, is a Hebrew word (מגדּלה מגדּל, מגדּל מגדּול) which means either a tower (from its size or height), an elevated stage (a rostrum or pulpit), or a raised bed (within a river). Physically, it can mean fortified land, i.e. a walled city or castle; or elevated land, as in a raised bed, like a platform, possibly a lookout.

&quot;Migdol&quot; has been suggested as a loanword from Egyptian (mktr), &quot;mekter&quot;, or &quot;mgatir&quot; meaning &quot;fort,&quot; &quot;fortification,&quot; or &quot;stronghold,&quot; and the corresponding term in Coptic is ⲙⲉϣⲧⲱⲗ &quot;meštôl&quot;. (Figuratively, &quot;tower&quot; has connotations of proud authority.) However, the word clearly entered Egyptian from the original Northwest Semitic term &quot;magdalu,&quot; which itself originated with the Akkadian verb &quot;dagalu,&quot; meaning &quot;to look &quot;or&quot; watch.&quot; The association of the toponym with watchtowers is confirmed by the relationship of sites bearing Arabic place names related to Ar. &quot;majdal&quot; or &quot;majdaluna&quot;, which were strategically located along routes between Bronze Age centers. 

Although archaeologically, &quot;migdol&quot; has been traditionally identified with a specific type of temple, examples of which have been discovered, for instance, at Hazor, Megiddo, Tel Haror, Pella and Shechem, no temples are identified as migdols in ancient sources, outside of associations made by biblical scholars with a single passage in Judges 9 referencing a Migdol-Shechem. This identificaiton can be regarded as questionable, and particularly so in light of the evidence offered by more than sixty toponyms in the Levant, which are associated with important vista points above major routes.

==Places named Migdol or Migdal in the Hebrew Bible==
The Book of Exodus records that the children of Israel encamped at Pi-Hahiroth between Migdol and the Red Sea, before their crossing. It also appears in a couple of extra-biblical sources: Papyrus Anastasis V (20:2-3) implies that Migdol was built by Pharaoh Seti I of the 19th dynasty, the same king who first established the city of Piramesses; according to a map of the Way of Horus, Migdol is east of the Dwelling of the Lion, which has been located at Tell el-Borg, near the north coast of the Sinai Peninsula and the estuary of the Ballah Lakes. Its exact location has been identified with the site of T-211.

Joshua referred to Migdal-Gad, &#x27;tower of Gad&#x27;, one of the fortified cities of Judah, and also to Migdal-El, &#x27;tower of God&#x27;, one of the fortified towns of Naphtali ().

Jeremiah referred to Migdol (Jeremiah 44:1) in its near-geographical relation to Tahpanhes and Memphis, three Egyptian cities where the Jewish people settled after the Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC). At this time, the city&#x27;s name had moved its location to Tell Qedua.

Ezekiel referred to Migdol in describing the length of the land of Egypt &quot;from Migdol to Syene (Aswan)&quot;. (, ).

The letters of Šuta refer to a &quot;Magdalu in Egypt&quot; which Albright identified with Jeremiah&#x27;s Migdol.

==Places in modern Israel named Migdal==
Migdal is a town in the northern district of Israel, 8 km north of Tiberias.

Migdal Ha&#x27;emek is a city in modern-day Israel, situated on a large hill surrounded by the Kishon river, west of Nazareth.

<text>Grisaille ( or ; , from &quot;gris&quot; &#x27;grey&#x27;) means in general any European painting that is painted in grey. 

==History==
Giotto used grisaille in the lower registers of his frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua () and Robert Campin, Jan van Eyck and their successors painted grisaille figures on the outsides of the wings of triptychs, including the &quot;Ghent Altarpiece&quot;. Originally these were the sides on display for most of the time, as the doors were normally kept closed except on feast days or at the (paid) request of tourists. However, today these images are typically unseen in museums, the triptych displayed in its open state, flat against a wall. In these cases, imitation of sculpture was intended, as sculpture remained more expensive than a painting, even one by an acknowledged master.

Limners often produced illuminated manuscripts in pen and wash with a very limited colour range, and many artists such as Jean Pucelle (active 1320–1350) and Matthew Paris specialised in such work, which had been especially common in England since Anglo-Saxon times. Renaissance artists such as Mantegna and Polidoro da Caravaggio often used grisaille to imitate the effect of a classical sculptured relief or Roman painting.

In the Low Countries, a continuous tradition of grisaille painting can be traced from Early Netherlandish painting to Martin Heemskerck (1498–1574), Pieter Brueghel the Elder (&quot;Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery&quot;, 1565) and Hendrik Goltzius, and through the copious output of Adriaen van de Venne, to the circle of Rembrandt and Jan van Goyen.

Portions of the ceiling frescoes of the Sistine Chapel are executed in grisaille, as is the lower section of the great staircase decoration by Antonio Verrio ( 1636 – 1707) at Hampton Court.

=== Modern examples ===

Grisaille, while less widespread in the 20th century, persists as an artistic technique. Pablo Picasso&#x27;s painting &quot;Guernica&quot; (1937) stands as a prominent example.

Contemporary American painter Hugo Bastidas has become known for black-and-white paintings that imitate the effect of grisaille and often resemble black-and-white photographs. His medium- and large-scale paintings feature contrasting zones of high and low detail.

===Enamel and stained glass===

The term is also applied to monochrome painting in other media such as those involving enamels, in which an effect similar to a relief in silver may be intended. Grisaille is also common in stained glass, as the need for sections in different colours is greatly reduced, such as York Minster&#x27;s Five Sisters window. Portions of a window may be done in grisaille using, for example, silver stain or vitreous paint, while other sections are coloured glass.

==&quot;Brunaille&quot; and &quot;verdaille&quot;==

Monochrome work is sometimes executed in colours other than grey: a &quot;brunaille&quot; is a painting executed entirely or primarily in shades of brown, while a &quot;verdaille&quot; is the same for green. Such works are said to have been painted &quot;en brunaille&quot; or &quot;en verdaille&quot;, respectively.

&quot;Brunaille&quot; and &quot;verdaille&quot; painting both have their roots in 12th century stained glass made for Cistercian monasteries, which prohibited the use of coloured art in 1134. The term &quot;brunaille&quot; was first used to refer to all-brown paintings in the 17th century.

<text>was an admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. He also served as Minister of the Navy. He was convicted of waging aggressive war and sentenced to life imprisonment.

==Early life and education==
A native of Tokyo, Shimada graduated from the 32nd class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1904. He was ranked 27th out of 192 cadets. One of his classmates was the famous admiral Isoroku Yamamoto.

Shimada served his midshipman duty aboard the submarine tender , and the cruiser , participating in the Battle of Tsushima during the Russo-Japanese War.

==Career==

After his commissioning as an ensign on 31 August 1905, he was assigned to the cruisers and , and was promoted to sub-lieutenant on 28 September 1907. After his promotion to lieutenant on 11 October 1909, he served on the battlecruiser and battleship .

After graduating with highest honors from the Naval War College in December 1915, Shimada was promoted to lieutenant commander on 13 December and assigned as an assistant naval attaché in Rome, Italy during World War I.

Returning to Japan after the war, Shimada held various staff positions in the 1920s as a staff officer in the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff. He was promoted to commander on 1 December 1920 and assigned as executive officer of the battleship in 1922, an instructor at the Naval War College in 1923 and commander of the 7th Submarine Division in 1926.

He was promoted to captain on 1 December 1924, and his first command was the cruiser in 1928, followed by the battleship later the same year.

Shimada was promoted to rear admiral on 30 November 1929, and assigned as Chief of Staff to the IJN 2nd Fleet. After Shimada was transferred to IJN 1st Fleet in December 1930, he served as Commandant of the Submarine School, before being assigned to the IJN 3rd Fleet in February 1932. As commander of the IJN 3rd Fleet, he participated in the First Shanghai Incident of 1932.

Returning to the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff as a senior staff officer in June 1932, he served as Chief of the Third Department, Naval Intelligence, where he started espionage operations against the US, and later served concurrently as Chief of the First Department from November 1932 to October 1933 when he assumed total command. Becoming Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff in December 1933, Shimada was promoted to vice admiral on 15 November 1934.

During the late-1930s Shimada&#x27;s positions included commandant of the Kure Naval District, commander in chief of the IJN 2nd Fleet and China Area Fleet as well as commanding officer of the Yokosuka Naval District.

Shimada was named Minister of the Navy on 18 October 1941. During his term as Navy Minister, he knew of the plans for the attack on Pearl Harbor and approved its implementation. Although largely regarded as a submissive lackey for his reputation of meek submissiveness and unquestioning loyalty to Prime Minister Hideki Tōjō (which created considerable unpopularity and criticism among his naval associates, who would refer to him as &quot;Tōjō&#x27;s &quot;Yurufun&quot;&quot; (&quot;Tōjō&#x27;s Droopy Drawers&quot;), Tōjō&#x27;s &quot;tea servant&quot; or &quot;briefcase carrier&quot; behind his back), Shimada played an important role in working with Tōjō in coordinating military operations between the Army and Navy during the early years of the Pacific War.

On November 30, the Emperor Showa asked Shimada if he would really wage war. Shimada said, &quot;We are ready, I do not trust Germany, I mentioned that Japan alone can continue the war.&quot;

After a series of major Japanese losses, Emperor Hirohito lost confidence in both the Army and Naval Chiefs of Staff. As such, Tōjō was able to dismiss Chief of the Army General Staff Hajime Sugiyama and Chief of the Naval General Staff Osami Nagano. Tōjō assumed the role of Army Chief of Staff while Shimada became Naval Chief of Staff on 21 February 1944, concurrent with his position as Naval Minister. This reorganization made Shimada supreme commander of the Imperial Japanese Navy.

Shimada&#x27;s power grab, however, gained him many enemies in the Navy General Staff and the Emperor&#x27;s court. Shimada&#x27;s opponents continuously pressured Emperor Hirohito to dismiss him, citing that the navy was losing battle after battle under Shimada&#x27;s direction. Hirohito finally made his displeasure with Shimada known to Tōjō in July 1944, shortly after the fall of Saipan. Tōjō immediately asked for Shimada&#x27;s resignation, and replaced him as Navy Minister with Mitsumasa Yonai on 17 July and as Chief of the General Navy Staff on 2 August.

Although appointed to the Supreme War Council, Shimada retired from active duty on 20 January 1945 remaining in an advisory capacity for the remainder of the war.

==Later life and death==
After the war, Shimada was arrested by the SCAP authorities and charged with war crimes. At the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for waging aggressive war against the United States, United Kingdom, China and the Netherlands. After the end of the American occupation of Japan, he was released on parole in 1955 by Prime Minister Ichirō Hatoyama. He died in 1976.

<text>Oxalis corniculata, the creeping woodsorrel, procumbent yellow sorrel or sleeping beauty, is a somewhat delicate-appearing, low-growing herbaceous plant in the family Oxalidaceae.

It is a small creeping type of woodsorrel that tends to grow well in moist climates. It resembles the common yellow woodsorrel, &quot;Oxalis stricta&quot;.

==Description==

It has a narrow, creeping stem that readily roots at the nodes. The trifoliate leaves are subdivided into three rounded leaflets and resemble a clover in shape. Some varieties have green leaves, while others, like &quot;Oxalis corniculata&quot; var. &quot;atropurpurea&quot;, have purple. The leaves have inconspicuous stipules at the base of each petiole. The flowers are small and yellow, with some having round-edged petals and others possessing sharp ends. The flowers close when direct sun is not hitting the plant, hence the name &quot;sleeping beauty&quot;. Some specimen can have a single flower while others can have over 20.



The fruit is a narrow, cylindrical capsule, long, and noteworthy for its explosive discharge of the contained seeds, long. Pollen is about 34 microns in diameter.

==Distribution==
This species probably comes from southeastern Asia. It was first described by Linnaeus in 1753 using specimens from Italy, and it seems to have been introduced to Italy from the east before 1500. It is now cosmopolitan in its distribution and is often regarded as a weed in gardens, agricultural fields, and lawns.

== Chloroplast genome ==
The chloroplast genome sequence is 152,189 bp in size, and contains 131 genes. It includes a pair of 25,387 bp inverted repeats that separate a large 83,427 bp single copy region. The genome suggests that this plant is closely related to &quot;O. drummondii&quot;.

==Uses==
The leaves of woodsorrel are edible, and have a tangy taste like lemons. A drink can be made by infusing the leaves in hot water for about 10 minutes, sweetening, and then chilling. The entire plant is rich in vitamin C. Any woodsorrel is safe in low dosages, but if eaten in large quantities over a length of time can inhibit calcium absorption by the body.

As a hyperaccumulator of copper, it can be used for phytoremediation. The 1491 Ming Dynasty text, &quot;Precious Secrets of the Realm of the King of Xin&quot;, describes how to locate underground copper deposits by extracting trace elements of copper from the plant.

Indigenous peoples of Taiwan frequently grow this plant (known roughly as &quot;p-r-səʔ&quot;) as a cure for snakebites and scabies.

<text>John Joseph Theodore Rzeznik (; born December 5, 1965) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and producer. He is best known as the guitarist and frontman of the rock band Goo Goo Dolls, with whom he has recorded several chart-topping hits, including &quot;Iris&quot;, &quot;Slide&quot;, and &quot;Name&quot;.

Born and raised in Buffalo, New York, Rzeznik grew up in a working-class Polish-American family, heavily influenced by music from a young age. Rzeznik formed the Goo Goo Dolls in 1985 with bassist Robby Takac, and the band achieved success in the 1990s with a series of albums that blended alternative rock, punk, and power-pop influences. The band&#x27;s breakthrough was the 1998 album &quot;Dizzy Up the Girl&quot;, whose biggest hit, &quot;Iris&quot;, topped the charts after its inclusion on the soundtrack for the 1998 film &quot;City of Angels&quot;.

Rzeznik&#x27;s other projects include songwriting for film soundtracks and producing music for other artists. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2008 and received accolades throughout his career. Rzeznik has been open about his personal struggles, including his battle with alcoholism, and is a dedicated philanthropist, participating in charity events and fundraisers.

==Early life==
Rzeznik was born in Buffalo, New York, the youngest of five children and only son of Edith (née Pomeroy) and Joe Rzeznik, a bar proprietor and postal clerk. Both of Rzeznik&#x27;s parents were musicians, playing the clarinet and flute. Rzeznik had a strict Catholic upbringing in Buffalo&#x27;s working-class East Side Polish neighborhood and attended Corpus Christi Grammar School. Rzeznik&#x27;s paternal grandparents were born in Poland. The original pronunciation of his last name Rzeźnik is &quot;Zhezh-neek&quot; (zh as in bei&quot;ge&quot;) , Polish for &quot;butcher&quot;.

Rzeznik&#x27;s father died at the age of 53 on February 2, 1981, from a diabetic coma when Rzeznik was 15 years old. On October 26, 1982, his mother died at the age of 51 from a sudden heart attack in the family&#x27;s living room. Having lost both of his parents, he was brought up by his four older sisters, Phyllis, Fran, Gladys and Kate, with help from their cousin, John Guljas. He paid for his own apartment using Social Security Survivor Benefit checks. It was during this period and while attending McKinley Vocational High School that Rzeznik began playing the guitar. He briefly attended Buffalo State College, dropping out after his first year.

==Career==
===Goo Goo Dolls===

In 1985, Rzeznik formed the band that became the Goo Goo Dolls with Robby Takac. Previously Rzeznik had been in a band with Takac&#x27;s cousin, called The Beaumonts.

In the early days of the Goo Goo Dolls, the band performed at gigs relentlessly, with Takac as the frontman (Rzeznik gradually becoming the frontman over the next few albums, as each new album contained more songs sung by Rzeznik than the last). They were soon picked up by a small record label, Celluloid. Under Celluloid, they released their first eponymous album on a $750 budget (later the re-prints would be referred to as &quot;First Release&quot;). This attracted the attention of a larger record label, Metal Blade, who released their next few albums. 

For the next few years, the band toured and worked on new material. The band received early success with the single &quot;Name&quot; as well as being featured in &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Dead: The Final Nightmare&quot; with the song &quot;I&#x27;m Awake Now&quot;. Fast forward to their album &quot;Dizzy Up the Girl&quot;, the single &quot;Iris&quot; became a critical success due in large part to the release of the film &quot;City of Angels&quot; and it being a featured music video for the film.

===Other activity===
Following the album &quot;Gutterflower&quot;, Rzeznik wrote &quot;Always Know Where You Are&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; for the Disney film &quot;Treasure Planet&quot;, which were also released as a single independently from the band.

He, along with Ryan Cabrera produced the latter&#x27;s 2004 album Take It All Away with Rzeznik being the main producer.

From October to December 2007, Rzeznik was a judge alongside Sheila E. and Australian Idol judge and marketing manager Ian &quot;Dicko&quot; Dickson on the Fox network&#x27;s The Next Great American Band.

On June 19, 2008, Rzeznik was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and was awarded the Hal David Starlight Award.

On March 24, 2014, Cash Cash released their new single &quot;Lightning&quot;. The single featured Rzeznik on vocals and was written by Cash Cash and Rzeznik together.

On November 29, 2020, he participated in a virtual fundraiser to help combat hunger and raise money for the Community Foodbank of New Jersey.

== Musical style==
===Influences===
Most of the music Rzeznik listened to while growing up was influenced by his sisters, and consisted of classic rock such as The Rolling Stones and The Kinks. The youngest of his four older sisters moved towards punk music and Rzeznik became interested in bands such as Ramones and The Clash. Rzeznik attributes his gift for melody to listening to bands such as Kiss, Cheap Trick, The Cure and Rush in the early 1980s. Rzeznik also cites Paul Westerberg as an &quot;obvious influence&quot; on his music. Westerberg co-wrote the 1993 Goo Goo Dolls song &quot;We Are the Normal&quot; with Rzeznik, who reflected on the experience by stating &quot;To some people, Keith Richards is their hero. I feel that way about Westerberg. Keith Richards got to do his thing with Chuck Berry, and I got to do it with Westerberg. That was amazing to me.&quot;

Rzeznik has stated that his dream collaboration would be with singer/songwriter Grace VanderWaal.

===Songwriting===
Rzeznik believes writing is not just an inspirational act but that writing music is &quot;ninety nine percent perspiration.&quot; He says that when writing a song, he often &quot;runs tape and screws around with stuff,&quot; and his songs are often both biographical and autobiographical. According to Rzeznik, before penning down the song &quot;Iris&quot;, he was on the verge of leaving the band because he had been writing songs for the past nine years and it had been a low. However, Rzeznik was approached for writing the soundtrack of the movie &quot;City of Angels&quot;, and after watching the movie, Rzeznik penned down the song, which changed the band&#x27;s career.

===Guitar tunings===
Rzeznik is known for his use of alternate guitar tunings in his songs. Rzeznik has said that he would &quot;basically sit there at night and just start tuning my guitar strings up and down until something sounded really cool.&quot; For example, &quot;Iris&quot; is played with the guitar tuned to BDDDDD.

==Equipment==
After the Goo Goo Dolls&#x27; equipment was stolen from a van in New York City (including Rzeznik&#x27;s Marshall JCM800 amplifier and his only guitar at the time), following the recording of their 1989 album, &quot;Jed&quot;, a custom, yellow Stratocaster-style guitar (later nicknamed &quot;Boing&quot;) was made for Rzeznik by ESP. Now without an amplifier, Rzeznik borrowed a near-identical Marshall JCM800 from a mutual friend of the band, Charles Root. This amp was then used to record &quot;Hold Me Up&quot; and &quot;Superstar Car Wash&quot;. Since the late 1990s, Rzeznik has used Fender electric guitars. He has used many variations such as the Stratocaster, Telecaster, Jaguar and a &quot;Halfcaster&quot; (a Stratocaster cut in half). He also used Guild acoustic guitars on the &quot;Dizzy Up the Girl&quot; and &quot;Gutterflower&quot; tours. Rzeznik noted in a 2003 interview that &quot;No matter what guitar I have, it seems that anything with strings makes music to my ears.&quot;

==Personal life==
Rzeznik met former model Laurie Farinacci in 1990, married her in 1993 but divorced in 2003; they did not have any children. He started dating Melina Gallo in 2005 and married her in Malibu, California, on July 26, 2013. On December 22, 2016, he and Gallo had their first child, a daughter, Liliana. Rzeznik divorced Gallo in 2019. Rzeznik resides in Westfield, New Jersey. 
Rzeznik is a recovering alcoholic. In a 2018 interview, he reported that he had been sober for nearly four years.

<doc id="738254" wikidata="Q2940678" url="?curid=738254" title="Multicart">
<text>In video game parlance, a multicart is a cartridge that contains more than one game. Typically, the separate games are available individually for purchase (such as &quot;Sega Smash Pack&quot;) or were previously available individually (such as &quot;Final Fantasy: Dawn of Souls&quot;). For this reason, collections, anthologies, and compilations are considered multicarts. The desirability of the multicart to consumers is that it provides better value, greater convenience, and (in the case of portable games) more portability than the separate games would provide. The advantage to developers is that it allows two or more smaller games to be sold together for the price of one larger game, and provides an opportunity to repackage and sell older games one more time, often with little or no changes. 

Multicarts are distinct from minigame series such as &quot;Mario Party&quot;, &quot;Game &amp; Watch Gallery&quot;, or &quot;WarioWare&quot;. These games are made up of several minigames specifically created for the overall game experience. In contrast to this, the NES multicart &quot;Super Mario Bros./Duck Hunt&quot; contains two full-version games, each of which were available for purchase individually. 

Although most commonly associated with NES and SNES, multicarts, both authorized and unauthorized, have appeared for many cartridge-based systems, including the Atari 2600, Intellivision, Odyssey 2, Master System, Sega Genesis, Vectrex and Game Boy. As storage capacity on cartridges continues to grow and become less expensive, the popularity of multicarts has seen a resurgence on the only remaining cartridge-based systems, those of Nintendo’s Game Boy Advance and DS. Since launch, these systems have seen an increase in the number of “2-in-1” and “3-in-1” games, with some re-releasing popular titles previously seen on the same platform such as Konami&#x27;s &quot;Castlevania&quot;.

==Pirate multicarts==
Among pirate Famicom games, multicarts often advertise an inflated number of games on their labels, calling them &quot;x-in-1&quot; (x can be any number greater than 1, such as &quot;76-in-1,&quot; &quot;200-in-1,&quot; &quot;1200-in-1,&quot; and even &quot;9999999-in-1&quot;), but in reality usually only have anywhere from five to one hundred truly unique games. The list is padded by different variations of these games, modified to start the player either at different levels or with different power-ups. The games are usually first-generation Famicom titles, several of which were never officially released outside of Japan, and in typical pirate fashion have either had their names deliberately misspelled, their copyright notices/logos removed, or both.

Other popular video game systems also have their own share of unique pirate multicarts. Unlike the Famicom, the Nintendo Game Boy multicarts have a variety of different, innovative multicart designs. Standard-sized Game Boy multicarts have either a game selection menu like the NES multicarts, or require quick toggling of the Game Boy power switch to select through games. Most of them incorporate an external soft reset button (not available on any original cart), so you can reset the game without powering off the system. To overcome the storage limitations of a standard-sized pirate cart, huge pirate carts were created. These unusually large and thick carts, more than two times the height and depth of a standard Game Boy cartridge, were able to store many of the larger new games, such as &quot;Donkey Kong Land&quot; easily. One drawback of these carts is they lack any battery backup, but some newer carts come with battery backup, so saving games on these carts is impossible if the battery backup is not included. Most of these carts were produced in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong.

There have been Game Boy Advance multicarts with several GBA games and several or even hundreds of NES ROMs. These carts are known to include some bootlegs, hacks or variations of games, advertising them as different games and giving them incorrect box arts on the main boxart.

==Unlicensed multicarts==
These multicarts were published with the consent of the owners of copyright in the games themselves, but without the console maker&#x27;s consent:
*&quot;Action 52&quot;, from Active Enterprises. This ambitious project attempted to put 52 unique games into a single cartridge, but shoddy programming and heavy code reuse between games, combined with a hefty $200 (USD) retail price, resulted in this game often being considered one of the worst multicarts.
*&quot;Caltron 6-in-1&quot; - Rare vintage NES multicart, later re-released as the &quot;Myriad 6 in 1&quot;
**&quot;MaxPlay Classic Games Volume 1&quot;
*&quot;Maxivision 15-in-1&quot;, which contained fifteen games from unlicensed NES manufacturers such as Color Dreams and American Video Entertainment.
* The North American versions of the &quot;Quattro&quot; series by Codemasters, published by Camerica
* Wisdom Tree compilations:
** &quot;Bible Adventures&quot; - This three-in-one Game Boy cartridge featured &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;, &quot;Baby Moses&quot;, and &quot;David and Goliath&quot;.
** &quot;King James Bible&quot; - This included the King James Version Bible in e-book format, plus &quot;Bible Word Match&quot; and &quot;Bible Shepherd&quot;.
** &quot;King of Kings: The Early Years&quot; - This three-in-one NES cartridge featured &quot;The Wise Men&quot;, &quot;Flight to Egypt&quot; and &quot;Jesus and the Temple&quot;.
** &quot;NIV Bible &amp; the 20 Lost Levels of Joshua&quot; - This included the New International Version Bible in e-book format, plus &quot;Bible Word Match&quot;, &quot;Bible Shepherd&quot; and &quot;Joshua: The Lost Levels&quot;. The latter is a port of &quot;Joshua &amp; the Battle of Jericho&quot; for the Game Boy, featuring 20 levels not available in the NES version.
** &quot;Sunday Funday&quot; - The last NES game released commercially in the United States for several years, this three-in-one cartridge featured the title game (a graphics hack of Color Dreams&#x27;s old &quot;Menace Beach&quot;), &quot;Fish Fall&quot; (a previously-unreleased puzzle game), and a karaoke program featuring a Christian pop song, &quot;The Ride,&quot; by 4Him.

<text>William Bell Wait (1839–1916) was a teacher in the New York Institute for the Education of the Blind who invented New York Point, a system of writing for the blind that was adopted widely in the United States before the braille system was universally adopted there. Wait also applied the New York Point principles to adapt them for use in over 20 languages, created a form of New York Point to notate music, and invented a number of devices to better type and print embossed material for the visually impaired.

==Education and early life==
William Bell Wait was born in Amsterdam, New York on March 25, 1839. He grew up in New York and attended the Albany Academy and later the Albany Normal College in 1859. Subsequent to graduating he obtained a teaching position at the New York Institute for the Education of the Blind, where he spent two years. He then went on to study under Tremain and Peckham in Albany. He was called to the bar in 1862. 

He married Phoebe Jane Babcock on October 27, 1863, and they had seven children.

He was acting first superintendent of the City of Kingston, N.Y. school district in 1863. In October 1863 he was appointed Principal of the New York Institute for the Education of the Blind. He served in this capacity until March 1905. He was subsequently appointed Emeritus Principal, and served until his death, which took place at his home in New York City on October 25, 1916.

==Inventions==

===New York Point System===
Wait developed a keen interested in raised letters and tried to devise a tangible printing and writing system. He later developed the New York Point System in which points were used to represent letters or their sound. This system contained &quot;twenty-six capitals, twenty-six small letters, numerals, punctuation marks and short forms for diphthongs, triphthongs, syllables and for words and parts of words in common use.&quot; He was awarded medals at the Chilean Exposition and International Exposition in 1873 for these accomplishments. Before his death Wait oversaw the adaptation of his point system to more than twenty different languages, including Hebrew, Arabic, Japanese and Chinese.

===Other inventions===

He followed his inventions with a tangible musical notation system in 1872.
He completed the Kleidograph in 1894. This machine is much like a typewriter which could be used for embossing the raised letters of the New York Point system unto paper.
He invented the Stereograph. This machine was used for metal plate embossing, to facilitate bulk printing of books for the visually impaired. He received the John Scott most deserving Medal from the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia in 1900 for his inventions.
He later developed a printing press which used a breakthrough process which allowed for embossing on dual sides of a book page. 
He also formulated more economic and durable methods of book binding, reducing the long-term costs of printing.

==Other accomplishments==

William B. Wait founded the following organizations:
* American Association of Instructors of the Blind (1871)
* Society for providing Evangelical Religious Literature for the Blind (1874)

==Publications==
William B. Wait wrote the following books:
* &quot;The Normal Course of Piano Technique&quot; (1887)
* &quot;Harmonic Notation&quot; (1888)
* &quot;Phases of Punctography in Relation to Visual Typography, writing, printing, bookbinding, and other features&quot; (1900)
* &quot;The Uniform Type Question: An examination of the report of the Uniform Type Committee of June, 1913&quot; (1915)
* &quot;New Aspects of the Uniform Type Folly&quot; (1916)

<doc id="738270" wikidata="Q494418" url="?curid=738270" title="Rangoon bombing">
<text>The Rangoon bombing of 9 October 1983, was an assassination attempt against Chun Doo-hwan, the fifth president of South Korea, in Rangoon, Burma. The attempt was orchestrated by North Korea. Although Chun survived, 21 people died in the attack and 46 were injured. One suspect was later killed, and the two other suspected bombers were captured, one of whom confessed to being a North Korean military officer.

==Bombing==
On 9 October 1983, President Chun Doo-hwan flew to Rangoon on an official visit to the capital of Burma. During the visit he planned to lay a wreath at the Martyrs&#x27; Mausoleum to commemorate Aung San, one of the founders of independent Burma who was assassinated in 1947. As some of the president&#x27;s staff began assembling at the mausoleum, one of three bombs concealed in the roof exploded. The huge blast ripped through the crowd below, killing 21 people and wounding 46 others. Four senior South Korean politicians were killed: foreign minister Lee Bum Suk; minister of power resource, Suh Sang-chul; economic planning minister and deputy prime minister, Suh Suk-joon; and minister for commerce and industry, Kim Dong-hwi. Fourteen South Korean presidential advisers, journalists, and security officials were killed; four Burmese nationals, including three journalists, were also among the dead. President Chun was saved because his car had been delayed in traffic and was only minutes from arriving at the memorial. The bomb was reportedly detonated early because the presidential bugle which signalled Chun&#x27;s arrival mistakenly rang out a few minutes ahead of schedule.

==Perpetrators==
Burmese police identified three suspects, a Korean People&#x27;s Army major and two captains. A police investigation revealed that they had slipped off a ship docked in Rangoon port, and had received explosives in a North Korean diplomatic mission. Suspect Kang Min-chul and another attacker attempted to commit suicide by blowing themselves up with a hand grenade that same day, but survived and were arrested, although Kang lost his right arm while the other man, Kim Jin-su, lost both an eye and an arm. Kim Jin-su was captured by a woman named Darr Sann Ye and four men, including Bo Gyi and Shwe Min Thar. A third suspect, Shin Ki-chul, went missing. He managed to kill three soldiers before being shot dead. Kang Min-chul confessed his mission and links to North Korea, an action by which he was able to avoid a death sentence and instead received life imprisonment. His colleague Kim Jin-su, who refused to confess or cooperate with investigations, was executed by hanging. North Korea denied any links to Kang, who was sent to Insein Prison, north of Rangoon.

==Aftermath==
The United States quietly provided military and logistics support to ensure that the surviving delegates and bodies of the deceased were safely returned to Korea. According to Victor Cha, an academic and former Director for Asian Affairs in the White House&#x27;s National Security Council, a South Korean official recounted to him the sentiment that &quot;this is what only a true ally like the United States was capable of doing, in ways that would never become public but would be remembered.&quot;

As a result of the bombing, Burma suspended diplomatic relations with North Korea. China, which had passed on a diplomatic note requesting trilateral talks between North and South Korea and the US on North Korea&#x27;s behalf just prior to the bombing, reprimanded North Korea in the state media. Chinese officials refused to meet or talk with North Korean officials for months afterward.

In 1994, the representative of South Korea to the United Nations General Assembly linked this incident with the downing of Korean Air Flight 858, which he alleged was sponsored by the same government acting with impunity. As a result, North Korea has been listed as a state sponsor of terrorism ever since (except between 2008 and November 2017).

==Kang&#x27;s fate==

One of the suspects, Kang Min-chul was Myanmar&#x27;s longest-serving prisoner. He learned to speak the Burmese language fluently according to one of his fellow prisoners. He also learned to climb mango trees with one arm and converted to Christianity. Kang received the biblical name &quot;Matthew&quot; after an inmate baptized him. Yangon&#x27;s moves towards resuming relations with North Korea led to speculation about what would happen to Kang. Because North Korea denied that he was a North Korean citizen, he may have been considered a stateless person. Kang reportedly did not want to go to North Korea, which he believed considered him a traitor (because of his having revealed its criminal operations); or to South Korea, which might have tried him for his role in the assassination attempt. He also worried for the safety of his mother and sister back in North Korea.

In 2006, Chung Hyung-keun, a member of South Korea&#x27;s Grand National Party and a former employee of South Korean intelligence, sponsored a bill to bring Kang to South Korea. Kang died of liver cancer on 18 May 2008 at the age of 53 while being transferred to the hospital from Insein Prison of Yangon. It was not known what happened to Kang&#x27;s remains upon his death.

<doc id="738271" wikidata="Q2088273" url="?curid=738271" title="Macintosh IIcx">
<text>The Macintosh IIcx is a personal computer designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer, Inc. from March 1989 to March 1991. Introduced six months after the Macintosh IIx, the IIcx resembles the IIx and provides the same performance, but is narrower, lighter, and quieter due to a smaller internal fan. The relative compactness results in three NuBus slots being available, compared with six on the IIx.

The new case, Apple&#x27;s first to be designed to operate in either a horizontal or vertical orientation, remained in use for its successors the Macintosh IIci and Quadra 700. The idea for vertical orientation, one of the first minitower cases, was suggested by Apple CEO John Sculley, who was running out of space on his desk, despite the fact that the new layout actually took more space once the monitor was taken into account. The model was designated IIcx for &quot;compact&quot; (echoing the earlier Apple IIc), and the &quot;x&quot; was Apple&#x27;s designation for the Motorola 68030 processor.

Users liked the Mac IIcx, in part, because its components and parts (such as the RAM, NuBus slots, and power supply) snapped into place inside the case without the need for screws. There was one central safety screw that tied the assembly together though it was often not reinstalled if ever removed. At the IIcx&#x27;s introduction, Jean-Louis Gassée demonstrated the IIcx&#x27;s modular design by assembling one from parts in front of the audience. This made it less expensive to build, easier to repair, and earned it heavy praise and a warm reception amongst the Mac community. The machine was also the lightest in Apple&#x27;s lineup at the time. However, unlike the II and IIx, in many versions of the IIcx the CPU is soldered to the logic board and therefore cannot be upgraded. The case is also unable to accommodate 5 1/4&quot; or full-height hard disk drives.

This model was superseded by the Macintosh IIci, which used the same case. It was designed by Gavin Ivester.

<doc id="738290" wikidata="Q3569449" url="?curid=738290" title="Wisdom Tree">
<text>Wisdom Tree, Inc. is an American developer of Christian video games. It was an offshoot of Color Dreams, one of the first companies to work around Nintendo&#x27;s 10NES lockout chip technology for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Color Dreams formed the Wisdom Tree subsidiary in 1990 in an effort to circumvent Nintendo&#x27;s restrictions against publishers of unlicensed video games for the NES by selling their games at Christian book stores which was not subject to pressure by Nintendo.

==History==
Color Dreams was based in Brea, California, and was started by Daniel Lawton, a self-educated computer programmer and vocal opponent of Nintendo&#x27;s licensing policy. Founded in 1988, Color Dreams was one of the largest producers of unlicensed games for the NES, but, due to pressure from Nintendo, it faced many difficulties getting retailers to stock its games. Although Color Dreams violated no laws in opting out of the Nintendo licensing system with its workaround of Nintendo&#x27;s 10NES lockout chip, Nintendo was displeased that it was receiving no revenues from Color Dreams games, and wanted to prevent other companies from following. Nintendo threatened to cease selling games to retailers that sold unlicensed NES games.

Because retailers could not afford to stop doing business with Nintendo, unlicensed companies were at a disadvantage. Color Dreams had great difficulty accessing the retail market, and worked outside of mainstream NES distribution channels. Also, many of its games were reported to have problems getting to run properly, occasionally even requiring instructions on the cartridge, and were criticized for their lack of quality and gameplay. The problems with running Color Dreams games stemmed from physical changes in later models of the NES; long-time Color Dreams employee Vance Kozik (best known as the programmer of &quot;Menace Beach&quot;) recalled having customers who called Color Dreams and read off the serial number of their NES unit so that they could send them a compatible cartridge. The quality issues with the games were in part due to the reverse engineering required to develop unlicensed NES games, which effectively forced the company&#x27;s programmers to work within stricter technical limitations than licensed NES developers had, such as fewer sprites displayed on-screen.

In 1990, Color Dreams began to consider producing games with biblical themes. At the time, there were few religious video games for console systems. Officials at Color Dreams saw a market for them and that many stores that would be most interested in retailing Christian games. Christian bookstores were likely not to sell video games at all, and thus not vulnerable to pressure from Nintendo. Christian bookstores sold much more than books, like religious movies, Contemporary Christian music, and other goods, but not video games. To convince these stores to sell religious games, Color Dreams changed its name to Wisdom Tree and promoted this new genre of video games. Wisdom Tree sent Christian bookstores 3-foot &quot;Bible Adventures&quot; displays, and VHS cassettes showing gameplay. These promotional videos made the case to Christian bookstores using lines like: &quot;This game promotes Bible literacy and teaches children about the Bible while they play a &#x27;fun and exciting&#x27; &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; style video game.&quot; Ultimately, these efforts proved successful, and Color Dreams gained a new distribution channel for its games, and launched a new genre of video games, without direct competition. Kozik later commented, &quot;No one knew it was going to take off, but it took off like crazy.&quot;

Nintendo never threatened any legal action against Wisdom Tree, and probably feared a public relations backlash from parents and religious groups.

Color Dreams also published games with the Bunch Games label. In 1996, its StarDot Technologies division started selling digital security cameras.

==Games==
Wisdom Tree&#x27;s games have a Christian theme, and were often sold in Christian bookstores. Most games adapt Bible stories to appeal to children of the video game era. Many of its games are partial conversion themed re-releases of Color Dreams games. A Wisdom Tree product catalog shows &quot;Joshua &amp; the Battle of Jericho&quot; as a side-scrolling game using the &quot;Bible Adventures&quot; engine. The actual released game has the engine of &quot;Crystal Mines&quot; and &quot;Exodus&quot;.

The company&#x27;s first release as Wisdom Tree is &quot;Bible Adventures&quot;, a three-in-one multicart with many gameplay elements from the American &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;, applied to three different Bible stories: Noah collecting animals for the Ark, saving Baby Moses from the Pharaoh&#x27;s men, and re-enacting the story of David and Goliath. The company sold 350,000 copies, encouraging this path.

Other Wisdom Tree games include &quot;Exodus&quot; (a conversion of Color Dreams&#x27;s &quot;Crystal Mines&quot; game, with the story of the Israelites&#x27; 40-year desert trek), &quot;King of Kings&quot; (similar to &quot;Bible Adventures&quot;, but featuring three events in the early life of Jesus Christ) and &quot;Bible Buffet&quot; (a &quot;video board game&quot; with Bible quizzes). &quot;Spiritual Warfare&quot; is an action-adventure game similar in style to &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, with the requisite religious theme where the player, as a foot soldier in the Lord&#x27;s army, is tasked with saving the souls of the heathen populace, using fruit of the spirit. The company released ports of some of these games to the Sega Genesis and Game Boy, and Bible-reading programs (both King James and NIV versions) for Game Boy. &quot;Sunday Funday&quot; is a 1995 conversion of the Color Dreams game &quot;Menace Beach&quot;, and is the last commercial NES release in the United States.

Wisdom Tree made the only unlicensed commercially released game for the North American Super NES, &quot;Super 3D Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;. This conversion of the &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; engine features the player as Noah, quelling upset animals on the Ark by flinging sleep-inducing fruit at them. As the only North American Super NES cartridge to not use the standard Nintendo-manufactured shell, its shape resembles the Super NES Game Genie or &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; on the Genesis, with a pass-through cartridge port at the top; the game requires a Nintendo-licensed cartridge plugged into this pass-through, bypassing the Super NES&#x27;s lockout protection. A PC port was released on Steam in 2015, with retouched features such as support for widescreen resolutions and achievements.

&quot;King of Kings&quot; was listed as the honorable mention in Gamespy.com&#x27;s &quot;Seven Christmas Games That Make You Hate Christmas&quot;, due to its unentertaining gameplay and the farcical feel of dodging &quot;acid-spitting camels&quot;.

Color Dreams pamphlets tout a lineup of Genesis games, all of them ports of Amiga games, but were all canceled. Other unfinished Color Dreams games include a PC game called &quot;Hellraiser&quot;. Another &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; engine game, it was canceled upon the release of &quot;Doom&quot; because Color Dreams decided it could not compete. &quot;Maggots&quot; for NES has the player character trapped inside a human corpse and must escape while avoiding the maggots which infest it.

==Ongoing activities==
Wisdom Tree mainly licenses its games. The company released an all-in-one &quot;TV controller&quot; system featuring seven of its NES games in a single, self-contained unit. Its website also has games by other developers. &quot;Heaven Bound&quot; is one example of a more modern 3D game for the PC. These games are produced on 3D Game Studio (such as &quot;Joseph&quot; and &quot;Galilee Flyer&quot; by Sunday Software), using the default models that come with the program.

In 2010, all Wisdom Tree NES games were on the official Wisdom Tree website via a Java-based NES emulator.

In 2013, retro game publisher Piko Interactive licensed cartridge reprints of Wisdom Tree games, starting with &quot;Super 3D Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;.

In 2014, retro gaming website Stone Age Gamer began selling licensed T-shirts based on numerous Wisdom Tree properties including: &quot;Bible Buffet&quot;, &quot;Sunday Funday&quot;, &quot;Super 3D Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;, and &quot;Exodus&quot;.

In 2015, a Windows remake of &quot;Super 3D Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; was released on Steam through the &quot;Steam Greenlight&quot; service.

<text>The Robot Hall of Fame, established by Carnegie Mellon University in 2003, honors significant robots in science, society, and technology. The organization was established in 2003 by the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as an acknowledgement of Pittsburgh&#x27;s achievements in the field of robotics and with the aim of creating a broader awareness of the contributions of robotics in society. The idea for the Robot Hall of Fame was conceived by Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science dean James H. Morris, who described it as a means of honoring &quot;robots that have served an actual or potentially useful function and demonstrated real skill, along with robots that entertain and those that have achieved worldwide fame in the context of fiction.&quot; The first induction ceremony was held at the Kamin Science Center on November 10, 2003. 34 robots – both real and fictional – have been inducted into the Robot Hall of Fame since its inception. An exhibit named Roboworld was present at the Kamin Science Center from June 2009 until June 2022, featuring a physical embodiment of the hall of fame. Now some of them may be found in the lobby of Rangos Giant Cinema.

From 2003 to 2010, inductees to the Robot Hall of Fame were chosen by a selected panel of jurors. The opportunity to nominate a robot for induction into the hall of fame was also made open to the public; nominators were required to submit a one-paragraph rationale explaining their selection. The voting process was altered significantly in 2012, with nominations instead being gathered from a survey of 107 authorities on robotics and divided into four categories: Education &amp; Consumer, Entertainment, Industrial &amp; Service, and Research. Through an online voting system, members of the public were allowed to vote for one nominee per category; only the top three nominees in each category, based on the results of the aforementioned robotics experts survey, were included on the ballot. Officials subsequently derived the final list of inductees from both the survey and the public vote. Robot Hall of Fame director Shirley Saldamarco said of the changes:

<doc id="738298" wikidata="Q460057" url="?curid=738298" title="Head of the Commonwealth">
<text>The Head of the Commonwealth is the ceremonial leader who symbolises &quot;the free association of independent member nations&quot; of the Commonwealth of Nations, an intergovernmental organisation that currently comprises 56 sovereign states. There is no set term of office or term limit and the role itself has no constitutional relevance to any of the member states within the Commonwealth. The position is currently held by King Charles III. &quot;Head of the Commonwealth&quot; is also a title of the monarch of each of the Commonwealth realms according to the Royal Style and Titles Act.

By 1949, what was then called the British Commonwealth was a group of eight countries, each having King George VI as monarch. India, however, desired to become a republic, but not to leave the Commonwealth by doing so. This was accommodated by the creation of the title &quot;Head of the Commonwealth&quot; for the King and India became a republic in 1950. Subsequently, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, other nations, including Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Ghana, and Singapore, also became republics, but, as members of the Commonwealth, recognised her as the organisation&#x27;s head. Per agreement reached at the CHOGM in 2018, Charles III succeeded Elizabeth II as head of the Commonwealth upon her death on 8 September 2022.

==History==
In the late 19th and early 20th century, the British Empire began to be referred to as the &quot;Commonwealth of Nations&quot;, with several colonies gaining substantial autonomy as they achieved Dominion status. Nevertheless, the unity of this Commonwealth was seen as being established by a shared allegiance to the British monarch. During the negotiations to end the Irish War of Independence, the rebel Irish president Éamon de Valera proposed a relationship between Ireland and the British Empire he called external association, under which Ireland would be a republic &quot;associated&quot; with the rest of the British Commonwealth, and would &quot;recognise His Britannic Majesty as head of the Association&quot; but not as Ireland&#x27;s King or head of state. This proposal was rejected, and the treaty that ended the war saw the Irish Free State remain part of the Commonwealth as a Dominion.

The Balfour Declaration of 1926 and the Statute of Westminster 1931 established that the Dominions were equal in status to one another and legislatively independent, which gave each of them the right to legislate in regard to their shared head of state; thus, the abdication of Edward VIII and the accession of his brother as George VI required separate action in each Dominion. The Irish Free State, under de Valera&#x27;s leadership, changed its constitutional law to create the office of an elected President of Ireland and limit the monarch to only a ceremonial role in foreign relations as a &quot;symbol of cooperation&quot; with other nations of the Commonwealth. This ambiguity over the Irish head of state allowed the rest of the Commonwealth to continue to regard George VI as a monarch they shared with Ireland even as de Valera declared that Ireland was now &quot;demonstrably a republic&quot;. Eventually the Irish government passed The Republic of Ireland Act 1948, eliminating the final roles the King had in the state and terminating the Republic&#x27;s membership in the Commonwealth when it went into effect in 1949.

At that point, George VI was still king of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, and Ceylon. However, India also wished to become a republic, but, unlike Ireland, did not wish to leave the Commonwealth. To accommodate this, the London Declaration, issued in late April 1949, stated that India wished to remain part of the Commonwealth, and regarded the King as the symbol of the voluntary association of the countries of the Commonwealth &quot;and as such the Head of the Commonwealth&quot;. By implication, this allowed India and other nations to become republics without leaving the Commonwealth. When India adopted a republican constitution on 26 January 1950, George VI ceased to be its monarch (the President of India, Rajendra Prasad, became head of state) and, thereafter, the country regarded him as Head of the Commonwealth.

George VI&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth II, became Head of the Commonwealth upon her accession on 6 February 1952, stating at the time, &quot;the Commonwealth bears no resemblance to the empires of the past. It is an entirely new conception built on the highest qualities of the spirit of man: friendship, loyalty, and the desire for freedom and peace.&quot; The following year, a royal styles and titles act was passed in each of the Commonwealth realms, adding, for the first time, the term &quot;Head of the Commonwealth&quot; to the monarch&#x27;s titles.

The Queen had a personal flag created in December 1960 to symbolise her as Head of the Commonwealth without being associated with her role as queen of any particular country. Over time, the flag replaced the British royal standard when the Queen visited Commonwealth countries of which she was head of state, but did not possess a royal standard for that country, or of which she was not head of state, as well as on Commonwealth occasions in the United Kingdom. When the Queen visited the headquarters of the Commonwealth Secretariat in London, this personal standard—not any of her royal standards—was raised.
South Africa was barred from re-entering the Commonwealth after it became a republic in 1961, as many Commonwealth members, particularly those in Africa and Asia, as well as Canada, were hostile to its policy of racial apartheid. Through the 1980s, Queen Elizabeth II sided with the majority of Commonwealth heads of government, and against her British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, on the matter of imposing sanctions on apartheid South Africa, a point echoed by former Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, who said, &quot;so steadfast was the Queen to the antiapartheid cause ... that, once again, she stood firm against the position of Thatcher&quot;. South Africa was re-admitted to the Commonwealth in 1994, following its first multiracial elections that year. Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Elizabeth was a &quot;behind the scenes force&quot; in ending apartheid in the country.

While the Queen never spoke publicly on the matter of apartheid, she was in 1961 photographed dancing with President Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana during her visit to Accra, celebrating Ghana&#x27;s establishment as a republic (also removing Elizabeth as head of state) within the Commonwealth the year before. This act was taken as the Queen&#x27;s symbolic expression of her anti-apartheid stance; the image offended the white South African government. However, Elizabeth&#x27;s visit, made despite recent bombings in the capital, was mainly intended to keep Ghana in the Commonwealth amid fears the country was getting too close to the Soviet Union.

After the Queen&#x27;s death in 2022, King Charles III became Head of the Commonwealth. He delivered his first Commonwealth Day message on 13 March 2023, in the week that marked the 10th anniversary of the Charter of the Commonwealth, which Charles III said, &quot;gives expression to our defining values—peace and justice; tolerance, respect, and solidarity; care for our environment and for the most vulnerable among us&quot;.

==Title==
The title was devised in the London Declaration as a result of discussions at the 1949 Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x27; Conference. It is rendered in Latin as &#x27;, and in French as &#x27;.

==Roles and duties==
The head of the Commonwealth serves as a leader, alongside the Commonwealth secretary-general and Commonwealth chair-in-office. Although Charles III is king of 15 member-states of the Commonwealth, he does not have any constitutional role in any Commonwealth state by virtue of his position as head of the Commonwealth. He keeps in touch with Commonwealth developments through regular contact with the Commonwealth secretary general and the Secretariat, the Commonwealth&#x27;s central organisation.

The head of the Commonwealth or a representative attends the biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), held at locations throughout the Commonwealth. This is a tradition begun by Queen Elizabeth II at the suggestion of Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in 1973, when the CHOGM was first held in Canada. During the summit, the head of the Commonwealth has a series of private meetings with Commonwealth countries&#x27; heads of government, attends a CHOGM reception and dinner, and makes a general speech.

The head of the Commonwealth or a representative has also been present at the quadrennial Commonwealth Games. The Queen&#x27;s Baton Relay, held prior to the opening of each Commonwealth Games, carries a message from the head of the Commonwealth to all Commonwealth Nations and territories.

Every year on Commonwealth Day, the second Monday in March, the head of the Commonwealth broadcasts a special message to the population of the Commonwealth; approximately 2.5 billion people. On the same day, the head attends an inter-denominational Commonwealth Day service, held at Westminster Abbey.


==Succession==
The position of head of the Commonwealth is not hereditary, with successors chosen by the Commonwealth heads of government. Once in office, there is no term limit.

Despite this, the words &quot;Head of the Commonwealth&quot; form part of the monarch&#x27;s title in each Commonwealth realm. Before Charles was selected as the organisation&#x27;s next head, Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper referred to Charles as &quot;the future head of the Commonwealth&quot; and Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key said, &quot;the title [of head of the Commonwealth] should just go with the Crown&quot;.
By 2018, with Elizabeth II in her 90s, there had been discussions for some time about whether her eldest son, Charles, or someone else should become the third head of the Commonwealth. Commentators in British newspapers opined on whether it should be a one-off decision to elect Prince Charles to the headship, the monarch of the Commonwealth realms should automatically become head of the Commonwealth, or the post should be elected or chosen by consensus. There was also speculation that a rotating ceremonial &quot;republican&quot; headship might be instituted. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that &quot;the post is not hereditary and many leaders want an elected head to make the organisation more democratic.&quot;

It was argued by Philip Murphy and Daisy Cooper that the role should simply lapse upon Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s death, as Prince Charles was, at the time, in an &quot;impossible position&quot;: promoting himself would be &quot;anachronistic and presumptuous&quot;, whereas showing no interest would be &quot;characterised as neglectful&quot;. Murphy and Cooper went further to say Charles would be a &quot;positively harmful&quot; symbol, &quot;reinforcing the prejudice that the Commonwealth is merely a throwback to empire&quot;. They felt that the position itself was an impediment to the influence of the Commonwealth Secretariat.

A report that Prince Charles would accompany the Queen to the 2015 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta claimed Elizabeth was &quot;determined to see the headship descend to her son&quot;, while accepting that &quot;it is not a done deal&quot;. In 2018, following that year&#x27;s CHOGM, the delegates declared that Charles would be the next head of the Commonwealth, while the role remained non-hereditary. Consequently, after the Queen&#x27;s death on 8 September 2022, Charles automatically became head of the Commonwealth.

<text>Stephanus pagination is a system of reference and organization used in modern editions and translations of Plato (and less famously, Plutarch) based on the three-volume 1578 edition of Plato&#x27;s complete works translated by Joannes Serranus (Jean de Serres) and published by Henricus Stephanus (Henri Estienne) in Geneva.

==Overview==
In the case of Plato&#x27;s works, Stephanus pagination first divides the works into numbers that are the page numbers of each of the Stephanus edition&#x27;s three volumes, and each such page and page number is further subdivided into lettered sections which correspond to parallel Greek/Latin translated passages on a given page, mostly commonly a, b, c, d, and e. This system is used in modern scholarship to cite Plato. For Plato&#x27;s works, unique coordinates for a passage can therefore be given with three pieces of information: the work&#x27;s name, the (Stephanus) page number, and the letter denoting the passage. For example, &quot;&quot;Symposium&quot; 172a&quot; cites &quot;Symposium&quot;, Stephanus page 172 (the volume in which &quot;Symposium&quot; occurs, as it happens, volume 3), passage a. To avoid ambiguity in this scheme, either the Platonic work or the volume must be cited; absent this, &quot;page 50&quot; might refer to any of the &quot;page 50s&quot; across Stephanus&#x27; three volumes. Reference to Stephanus manifestly presupposes the existing ordering of the work in its given volumes, but given historical disagreement as to the chronology and proper ordering of Plato&#x27;s works, care should therefore be taken when referring to Stephanus pagination as opposed to another scheme.

More specific citations may add line numbers, e.g. &quot;Symposium&quot; 209a5–9, but these generally refer to the lines in John Burnet&#x27;s Oxford Classical Text, not to Estienne&#x27;s line divisions.

There are some peculiarities in the Stephanus page numbers. The length of each page and each paragraph can vary if extra commentary appears on the page of the 1578 edition. Thus Stephanus pages are not all of the same length. Some pages do not have all the paragraphs a through e. There are also gaps in the sequence of Stephanus page numbers for Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; and &quot;Laws&quot;. The reason is that the editors added separate introductions to each &#x27;book&#x27; of these longer works, and thus the page numbers of these introductions are not used to refer to pages in Plato&#x27;s dialogues. 

The spurious dialogue &quot;Halcyon&quot; was included in the corpus of Lucian&#x27;s works and does not have Stephanus numbers.

Bekker numbering is the comparable system for the works of Aristotle, and Diels–Kranz numbering is the comparable system for Pre-Socratic philosophy. Unlike Stephanus pagination, Bekker numbering starts with page 1 and proceeds through all of Aristotle&#x27;s works without starting over, regardless of the number of volumes needed for a given edition. Bekker numbering therefore has the advantage, not shared by Stephanus pagination, of giving compact, unambiguous numerical citation of a given passage, page, etc, without the absolute necessity in order to avoid ambiguity to specify the dialogue, work or volume which exists in the case of Stephanus.

<doc id="738323" wikidata="Q605097" url="?curid=738323" title="Scaphism">
<text>Scaphism (from Greek , meaning &quot;boat&quot;), also known as the boats, is reported by Plutarch in his &quot;Life of Artaxerxes&quot; as an ancient Persian method of execution. He describes the victim being trapped between two small boats, one inverted on top of the other, with limbs and head sticking out, feeding them and smearing them with milk and honey, and allowing them to fester and be devoured by insects and other vermin over time. Plutarch&#x27;s report originates from a source considered dubious.

==Historical descriptions==
The first mention of scaphism is Plutarch&#x27;s description of the execution of the soldier Mithridates, given as punishment by king Artaxerxes II for killing his brother Cyrus the Younger, who had rebelled in an attempt to claim the throne of the Achaemenid Empire:

The 12th-century Byzantine chronicler Joannes Zonaras later described the punishment, based on Plutarch:

It is believed that Plutarch&#x27;s account of Scaphism came from Ctesias, a Greek physician and historian. However, Ctesias&#x27;s credibility is questionable due to his reputation for fanciful and exaggerated narratives. His uncorroborated accounts have stirred debates about the veracity of his work.

==In fiction==
* In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, the rogue Autolycus falsely tells the shepherd and his son that because Perdita has fallen in love with the prince, her adoptive father will be stoned, while her adoptive brother will be subjected to the following punishment: &quot;He has a son,—who shall be flayed alive; then &#x27;nointed over with honey, set on the head of a wasp&#x27;s nest; then stand till he be three quarters and a dram dead; then recovered again with aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as he is, and in the hottest day prognostication proclaims, shall he be set against a brick wall, the sun looking with a southward eye upon him,—where he is to behold him with flies blown to death.&quot; 
* In H. Rider Haggard&#x27;s &quot;The Ancient Allan&quot; the protagonist Allan Quatermain experiences a vision of one of his past lives, in which he was a great Egyptian hunter named Shabaka. At one time he is condemned to &quot;death by the boat&quot; by the &quot;King of kings&quot; because of a hunting bet they had made. When Shabaka asks what is to happen to him, he is told by a eunuch &quot;This, O Egyptian slayer of lions. You will be laid upon a bed in a little boat upon the river and another boat will be placed over you, for these boats are called the Twins, Egyptian, in such a fashion that your head and your hands will project at one end and your feet at the other. There you will be left, comfortable as a baby in its cradle, and twice every day the best of food and drink will be brought to you. Should your appetite fail, moreover, it will be my duty to revive it by pricking your eyes with the point of a knife until it returns. Also after each meal I shall wash your face, your hands and your feet with milk and honey, lest the flies that buzz about them should suffer hunger, and to preserve your skin from burning by the sun. Thus slowly you will grow weaker and at length fall asleep. The last one who went into the boat—he, unlucky man, had by accident wandered into the court of the House of Women and seen some of the ladies there unveiled—only lived for twelve days, but you, being so strong, may hope to last for eighteen.&quot;
* In &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; episode &quot;The Bellicose Proxy&quot; a variation of this torture is described with tubs in place of boats.
* In &quot;Instinct&quot;, Season 2 Episode 5 &quot;Ancient History&quot;, a victim of this torture is shown.
* In &quot;Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell&quot;&#x27;s Season 4 episode &quot;Milk and Honey&quot; this torture (and a demon in the business of selling the boats used for it) is prominent.
* Blindboy Boatclub&#x27;s short story &quot;Scaphism&quot; describes a murder committed using this method.
* The Beef and Dairy Network Podcast references scaphism as a vengeance that Eli Roberts would visit upon his nemesis Jane Palm in episode 95, &quot;Dafydd, Part 2&quot;.
* In &quot;Inside No. 9&quot;&#x27;s Season 8 episode &quot;The Last Weekend&quot;, this torture is used as a method of revenge.

<text>Halcyon Gallery is a contemporary art gallery in London. Founded by Paul Green in 1982 in Birmingham, Halcyon Gallery has more than 40 years of experience working with, developing and showcasing both established and emerging contemporary artists as well as modern masters from Impressionism to Pop Art.

==Location==
The gallery has three locations in London. There are two galleries located on New Bond Street in Mayfair, London, and a gallery in Harrods, Knightsbridge.

==Overview==
Halcyon Gallery was founded in 1982 by Paul Green. The gallery&#x27;s represented artists include Dominic Harris, Mitch Griffiths, James McQueen, and the musician Bob Dylan. It also owns works by Andy Warhol, David Hockney, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Pablo Picasso, and Claude Monet. 

Halcyon has three London galleries: two on New Bond Street and one at Harrods in Knightsbridge. Its flagship at 148 New Bond Street gallery is located in one of London’s oldest and most prestigious commercial gallery spaces. The Art Nouveau building was designed and built by celebrated architect Edward William Godwin in 1881, and was previously home to the Fine Arts Society for 142 years. 

Halcyon Gallery took possession of the listed address in 2019, undertaking a historically sympathetic yet comprehensive redesign of the building’s interior, resulting in the creation of an ultra-modern art space. The gallery opened its doors in Spring 2023.

For more than 25 years, Halcyon Gallery has partnered with the department store, Harrods. The 5,000 square ft gallery space is situated on the third floor of Harrods and exhibits of works by leading international artists. 

Halcyon Gallery has a commitment to art-led, philanthropic initiatives within the charitable and public sectors. The Gallery works with a carefully selected number of charities and non-profit organisations, including The Royal Parks Foundation and HRH The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award World Fellowship. Founder and President Paul Green says: “We believe in the life-enhancing value of art and through our exhibition programme, public sculpture placements and museum partnerships, we strive to make art accessible to all.”

The Gallery has also been involved in a series of public sculpture installations in numerous countries worldwide, from London’s Hyde Park to the Grand Canal in Venice, the courtyard of the State Hermitage in Saint Petersburg to Shanghai’s Financial district.

Ehud Sheleg, the treasurer of the UK&#x27;s Conservative Party, became director in 1999.

Investigations by Private Eye magazine allege Halcyon Gallery&#x27;s and Ehoud Sheleg&#x27;s financial affairs are a &quot;&quot;Byzantine and outlandish world of bizarre art deals, unpaid bills, dodgy Russian connections, and dodgy dealings all the way to Buckingham palace&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="738331" wikidata="Q7199059" url="?curid=738331" title="Pitstone Windmill">
<text>Pitstone Windmill is a Grade II* listed windmill in England. It is thought to have been built in the early 17th century, and stands in the northeastern corner of a large field near the parish boundary of Ivinghoe and Pitstone in Buckinghamshire. Presently, the windmill belongs to the National Trust.

==History==
It is thought to have been first built circa 1627 as this date is carved on part of the framework. This is the earliest date to be found on any windmill in the British Isles. It should be remembered that such a structure would have needed frequent repairs, so the mill may predate 1627. It was dendrochronologically dated in 2004 by Dr. Martin Bridge of the Oxford Dendrochronology Laboratory when the oldest pieces in the buck were found to be from trees felled in winter 1595/96 and spring 1597. The &#x27;new&#x27; crown tree was made from a tree that felled in spring 1670, while the quarter bars of the trestle were from trees felled between 1824 and 1826, so like most mills, it is a mix of old timbers variously recycled or hanging on from their original use.

For nearly three hundred years grain grown in the two adjoining villages was ground at the mill into flour. In 1874 the mill was bought by Adelbert Wellington Brownlow Cust, 3rd Earl Brownlow who owned the nearby Ashridge Estate. He subsequently left it to a local farmer, who ran a successful milling business from the mill.

In 1902, the mill was damaged beyond economic repair during an enormous gale. Around 1922, the derelict ruined mill was bought from the Ashridge Estate by a farmer whose land was close to the mill. In 1937, he donated it to the National Trust. However, it was not until 1963 that a band of volunteers began to carry out renovations at their own expense. The mill appeared in an episode of The Champions entitled &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, which was filmed in 1967. In 1970, after an interlude of 68 years, the mill once again ground corn.

Today the windmill is open to the public on Summer Sunday afternoons.

==Design==
Pitstone is a post mill, with the superstructure of the mill resting on a central post. The post rises from ground level, passing through a brick foundation chamber. The post is the pivot for the wooden body and sails above the chamber. The body and sails can be turned to face the direction of the wind. Reinforcements added in the 20th century prevented the upper section from turning. The mill machinery in the rotating section was reached by a flight of external steps.

<text>Abdel Fattah Yahya Pasha (; 1876–1951) was an Egyptian political figure. He served as Prime Minister of Egypt from 1933 to 1934.

He was Justice Minister in 1921 and 1930, and from 1930 to 1934 was Minister for Foreign Affairs. Though King Fuad I asked him to serve as Prime Minister from 1933 to 1934, he did not prove successful at leading the government in the face of popular opposition to the king. Elected a Senator in 1936, he proved more successful at chairing the Senate. He served on the delegation negotiating the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, and was among Egypt&#x27;s representatives at the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization.

<text>Palmer Cox (April 28, 1840 – July 24, 1924) was a Canadian illustrator and author, best known for &quot;The Brownies&quot;, his series of humorous verse books and comic strips about the mischievous but kindhearted fairy-like sprites. The cartoons were published in several books, such as &quot;The Brownies, Their Book&quot; (1887). Due to the popularity of Cox&#x27;s &quot;Brownies&quot;, one of the first popular handheld cameras was named after them, the Eastman Kodak Brownie camera.

==Life==
He was born in Granby, Quebec, the son of Michael and Sarah (Miller) Cox, and became a carpenter and car builder. He moved to San Francisco via Panama as a railroad contractor, and he lived in there from 1863 to 1875. In 1874, he began to formally study drawing and contribute illustrated stories to such publications as &quot;Golden Era&quot; and &quot;Alta California&quot;. After 1875, Cox lived in New York (Pine View House, East Quogue, Long Island). During this time he regularly contributed editorial cartoons to Oscar Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;United States Tobacco Journal&quot;.

The earliest publication of Brownie characters took place in 1879, but not until the February 1881 issue of &quot;Wide Awake&quot; magazine were the creatures printed in their final form. In 1883, &quot;Brownie&quot; stories appeared in &quot;St. Nicholas Magazine&quot; and as their popularity rose, they were covered in publications such as the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;.

Cox&#x27;s Brownies were little men who had mischievous adventures together. Each Brownie had a distinctive physical appearance: Cholly Boutonnière wore a top hat and monocle, while others wore traditional Turkish, Irish, German, Swedish, Russian, and Chinese garb. There was an Eskimo, an American Indian, even an Uncle Sam. &quot;Much of the success of his books can be attributed to his treatment of the characters, who portray human nature with its goodness and strength and also its follies, but never its baseness.&quot;.

&quot;As Cox developed his own Brownies, he retained characteristics found in the brownies of folklore, but he made notable changes. Whereas the Scottish brownie is usually a solitary being who remains in one household performing his domestic chores or field work, Cox&#x27;s Brownies are gregarious, always banding together and moving from place for their frolics and deeds of kindness.&quot;

&quot;The legendary brownie of Scotland ... in Cox&#x27;s words, was &#x27;good natured and harmless, never injuring anyone or doing any damage, and it was thought a very fortunate thing to have a Brownie about the house. No one could see the Brownie, only those gifted with second sight...Cox believed that brownies were so named because of their brown hair and weather-beaten countenances.&quot;

Cox died at his 17-room dream home named Brownie Castle at Granby, Quebec, July 24, 1924. His headstone has a Brownie figure and the inscription: &quot;In creating the Brownies he bestowed a priceless heritage on childhood&quot;.

==Homages in other works==

* Detroit composer Effie F. Kamman wrote &quot;The Dance of the Brownies&quot; (1893), inspired by the Cox characters. It was a popular hit.
*Richard F. Outcault referenced Cox and &quot;The Brownies&quot; (whom he parodied) in a February 9, 1895 cartoon of &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot;.
* In the 1943 children&#x27;s novel &quot;Rufus M.&quot;, by Eleanor Estes set during World War I, young Rufus Moffat and his older sister Jane have a contest involving Palmer Cox&#x27;s &quot;Brownie&quot; books: each new illustration, they compete to see who first spots the Brownie in the top hat.
* The idea of the character of Dunno (, Neznayka that is Don&#x27;tknowka) created by Soviet children&#x27;s writer Nikolay Nosov comes from the books of Palmer Cox.

<text>Dungeon Keeper is a strategy video game developed by Bullfrog Productions and released by Electronic Arts in June 1997 for MS-DOS and Windows 95. In &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;, the player builds and manages a dungeon, protecting it from invading &#x27;hero&#x27; characters intent on stealing accumulated treasures, killing monsters and ultimately the player&#x27;s demise. The ultimate goal is to conquer the world by destroying the heroic forces and rival dungeon keepers in each realm. A character known as the Avatar (resembling the Avatar from &quot;Ultima VIII: Pagan&quot;) appears as the final hero. &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; uses Creative Technology&#x27;s SoundFont technology to enhance its atmosphere. Multiplayer with up to four players is supported using a modem, or over a local network.

&quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; took over two years to develop, and an expansion pack, a Direct3D version, and a level editor were released. Midway through development, lead developer Peter Molyneux decided to leave Bullfrog when the game was complete, which was the motivation for its success. Versions for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation were in development, but cancelled. The game received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the uniqueness and depth. &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; was re-released on GOG.com in 2011, Origin in 2016, and Steam in 2024. A fan-made mod, &quot;KeeperFX&quot;, was released, which fixes bugs and adds features. &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; was followed by a sequel, &quot;Dungeon Keeper 2&quot;, in 1999, and influenced games such as &quot;Lego Rock Raiders&quot; and &quot;Ghost Master&quot;.

==Gameplay==

The player constructs and manages a dungeon, recruiting and catering for minions to run it and defend it from enemy invaders. The primary method of control is the hand, used to pick up creatures and objects in the dungeon, carry them around, and drop them. The hand allows the player to &#x27;slap&#x27; creatures and objects, and interact with them. &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; gameplay exemplifies a dark sense of humour.

The Dungeon Heart represents the Keeper&#x27;s link to the world. If it is destroyed, the player loses. Along with the heart, the player begins with a small number of imps, the generic work force for dungeon activities: they dig tunnels into the surrounding soil, capture enemy rooms and Portals, mine gold and gems, and set traps. Imps are obtained by using the Create Imp spell. Slapping creatures forces them to work faster temporarily, but removes some of their health. Gold is obtained primarily by digging Gold Seams, and Gem Seams provide an unlimited supply, though take longer to accumulate. Gold is used to build rooms, cast spells, and train creatures. To order the imps to dig a tile, the player need flag the tile. Throughout the game, a &quot;mentor&quot; will advise the player as to various happenings and problems within the dungeon, as a sinister voiceover.

Once the Imps are working, the player must then set up a basic infrastructure: Lairs for monsters, a Hatchery (where chickens, which serve as food, are grown), and a Treasury. After connecting the dungeon to a &#x27;Portal&#x27;, minions will arrive. Minions include dragons, warlocks, and the horned reaper, as well as undead creatures such as vampires and skeletons. As the game progresses, the player moves along a technology tree, unlocking further rooms and spells. Rooms can only be built on tiles belonging to the player. The player is red and the tiles are coloured accordingly. Other keepers have different colours, and the heroes are white. Unaligned creatures and rooms are multicoloured. The player can build traps and doors, created in the workshop. Traps include lightning and boulder traps, the latter instantly killing creatures it comes into contact with. As with rooms, they can only be built on tiles that belong to the player. Traps are not built instantly; Imps need to place them on the blueprint. The Temple is a room where creatures are made happy, and the player can sacrifice creatures to the dark gods. The gods may reward or punish the player, or be indifferent depending on the sacrifice.

The dungeon has a fleshed-out ecology: certain creatures are natural enemies. For example, Flies and Spiders are often found at odds with one another. Common behaviours when a creature is angry include vandalising the dungeon and deserting the player. The creatures are varied in their statistics; some excel at certain tasks, and others refuse to perform certain tasks. Which creatures enter the dungeon depends on which rooms the player has and how large they are; most creatures have prerequisites for entering service. Creatures require paying regularly, and when &#x27;Payday&#x27; comes, will head for the Treasure room to collect their wages. Other ways to obtain creatures include imprisoning and torturing them, &#x27;scavenging&#x27; (persuaded to defect to the player) from enemy keepers, and performing certain sacrifices at the Temple. Creatures entering via the Portal are at the lowest experience level, and must gain experience, usually by training in the training room. Training creatures increases their attributes (such as hit points) and abilities (such as which spells they can cast). Such spells include lightning bolts, rebounding projectiles, and increasing armour. Creatures will frequently enter combat with heroes or creatures belonging to another keeper. Each creature has a star of the colour of the keeper it belongs to above it, displaying its experience level. The star is a health meter; as a creature takes damage, the spikes turn black. The player has the ability to possess a creature, seeing the dungeon from its first-person perspective and using its attacks and abilities. This is one of the spells; others include speeding creatures up, and healing them.

A world map is available and, at the beginning, the player is allocated one of the twenty regions of a fictional, idyllic country to destroy. As the player progresses through these regions, each representing a level, the areas previously conquered will appear ransacked, twisted, and evil. The goals for each level are straightforward: they generally fall along the lines of eliminating the heroic force or destroying all other Dungeon Keepers. The first few levels are tutorials, teaching the player the basics. Special items are hidden throughout certain levels. Such items perform actions such as increasing the player&#x27;s creatures&#x27; experience level, or revealing the map. They can reveal a hidden level, where the player must perform a specific task, and is rewarded upon completion.

Heroes will appear at various points and times, sometimes accompanied by a tunneller dwarf, who, like imps, are able to dig. The dungeon can be protected from being breached by having the imps fortify the walls. Heroes include giants, wizards, and samurai warriors. Most levels have a &#x27;Lord of the Land&#x27;, a heavily armoured knight, who must be defeated. In the final level, the Avatar (resembling the Avatar from &quot;Ultima VIII&quot;), the most powerful hero, appears as the Lord of the Land, and is resurrected after being defeated. He must be defeated again when he reappears with a large army.

Multiplayer with up to four players is supported via a modem or over a local area network (LAN). The game features twenty multiplayer levels, playable as single-player levels.

==Development==
&quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; was developed by Bullfrog Productions under Peter Molyneux, who wrote the game design, testbed, and the computer players and assistant. In an interview, Molyneux explained that he came up with the ideas for &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; while sitting in a traffic jam, and become so engrossed in them that when the traffic had moved, he did not notice. Bullfrog&#x27;s chairman Les Edgar stated that the intention was to use the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; theme with &quot;slightly weird Bullfrog humour&quot;. Programmers Simon and Dene Carter also said &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; is a parody. &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; is a simulation game because Molyneux viewed the villain&#x27;s duty as a management exercise.

Development began in November 1994 by the lead programmer, Simon Carter, and took two and a half years to develop. The game used the engine for &quot;Magic Carpet&quot;, and the first version was merely scrolling around a map and entering third-person. The engine was built by Glenn Corpes. Molyneux then developed a 2D prototype containing features that made it into the final game. The prototype focused on constructing the dungeon, and included the Treasure room, Hatchery, Training room, and Dungeon Heart. The characters were designed by the artist, Mark Healey.

The navigation system proved difficult to develop because computers of the time lacked power. Artificial intelligence was considered crucial, as the navigation and other aspects relied on it. According to co-designer Jonty Barnes, the team wanted the creatures complex without high computational costs. Healey came up with the idea of slapping creatures to make them work faster, and Barnes considered it a &quot;great game decision&quot;. A great deal of time was spent working on the user interface, and at one point the idea of having no interface was considered. Carter stated that the team tried to make the sounds atmospheric and industrial so players got a sense of power. Using others&#x27; 3D sound routines proved troublesome, so he and his colleague Tony Cox wrote their own. &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; uses lighting algorithms used in &quot;Magic Carpet&quot;, which provided effects such as fireballs lighting corridors.

According to Molyneux, in May 1995 publisher Electronic Arts told him he had to ship &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; in six and a half weeks. Though he satisfied their demands by producing another game, &quot;Hi-Octane&quot;, in the required time frame, his relationship with the publisher was strained.

Development on the level editor began in May 1995. The first-person view was developed in September 1995, and the creatures had shadows added, which was believed impossible at the time. Around that time, Barnes left the project to complete a degree at the University of East Anglia, and returned in July 1996. In November 1995, Barrie Parker began writing levels, and developed content for the script language. Bullfrog tried to get a version out for Christmas 1995: it was originally scheduled for release in November 1995, and Molyneux, until September, believed that it would be ready by Christmas. He explained that it was mostly complete, but wanted to make sure that it was &quot;absolutely brilliant&quot;. It was then the development team realised the game should focus on a living world created by the player. A December 1995 &quot;PC Zone&quot; preview reported a feature that would have let the computer take control of the player&#x27;s dungeon after logging out of an internet multiplayer game.

In February 1996, Molyneux decided to focus on the project full-time. According to Carter, the creatures were made from bitmaps, and there was around 90 megabytes of graphics data on screen as of April 1996. In July 1996, Alex Peters joined the project and ported the game to Windows 95. &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; was shown at the European Computer Trade Show in September 1996, and was scheduled for release in December. It became evident that the deadline would be missed, and the release was pushed back to March 1997. The final testing began in April 1997, and &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; was signed off in June. &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; was released by Electronic Arts for Windows 95 and MS-DOS in North America on 26 June 1997, and in Europe and Australia on 3 July. Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation versions were in development and due for release in 1997, but cancelled. An internet version was in development, and would have supported up to 250 players.

Carter wrote and organised 800,000 lines of code. Richard Ridings provided voice-overs such as the overworld mentor. The music was composed by Russell Shaw and, according to Healey, this came late in development. The prospect of working on &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; motivated artist and former Bullfrog employee Gary Carr to return from The Bitmap Brothers (he had left Bullfrog because of a disagreement with Molyneux on &quot;Theme Park&quot;), but he was assigned to &quot;Theme Hospital&quot; instead. Healey produced 90 per cent of the graphics. Most of the creatures were the team members&#x27; ideas, although Molyneux was involved with the Imps. Healey designed the Horned Reaper (who is based on an ex-girlfriend of his), who ultimately become the game&#x27;s mascot. According to Molyneux, each character takes 1024 bytes of memory. The game as it ended up was developed mostly in the final few months: the team started again from scratch long into the development cycle because they felt it played like &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;. Before the redesign, instead of having Imps dig the gold and minions entering through portals, the game had the player dig gold and use it and mana to create minions. The redesign included the replacement of the 3D graphics engine with a 2D one and the rewriting of the user interface.

Molyneux was impressed with the creature&#x27;s navigation code: he stated that it is the largest piece of code, and that players could change the map repeatedly and creatures will still find routes to their destinations. Molyneux also liked the fact that the game adapts to the player, enabling the choice of the preferred methods and strategies, and stated that his favourite part of the game is how the player digs out rather than build up, meaning the player has heavy involvement in building the level. He stated that he was proud of &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;″s concept, but remarked that doing original things takes time. He also liked that people were unable to describe &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; in any particular way. Molyneux disliked the user interface, saying the team overdid the control panel, and commented that it was a reminder that the player was playing a video game. This was a key reason the user interface of his next video game, &quot;Black &amp; White&quot;, did not feature panels, buttons, or icons. Molyneux also disliked the lack of opponent personality, and some features being hidden too well, including (according to him) a cheat code that made the mistress creature naked. In a 2000 Game Developers Conference demonstration of &quot;Black &amp; White&quot;, he stated that it remained undiscovered.

&quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; was Molyneux&#x27;s final project with Bullfrog before he left in July 1997 to form Lionhead Studios, and after completion, he stated that he wanted to make &quot;the coolest game ever&quot;. Molyneux decided to leave Bullfrog in July 1996 due to frustration over corporate meetings and other management responsibilities that ensued after it was sold to Electronic Arts in 1995. He intended to leave as soon as &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; was complete, and his departure was one reason he wanted to make the game good. As a result of Molyneux&#x27;s decision, Electronic Arts asked him to leave its offices, but Molyneux wanted to continue development, so the team moved into his house. Molyneux, Mark Webley, Tim Rance, and Steve Jackson made the decision to found Lionhead when &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; was nearing completion. In 2017, Molyneux expressed regret at leaving Bullfrog, and explained that he was drunk when he handed his notice in, and that it was &quot;such a silly thing to do&quot;.
A sequel, &quot;Dungeon Keeper 2&quot; was released in 1999, and the series was rebooted by Mythic Entertainment with the release of a remake (also titled &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;) for iOS and Android on 30 January 2014.

=== SoundFont support ===
The game uses SoundFonts to provide additional ambient sound effects. A Sound Blaster AWE32 or AWE64 is required to use this feature. The player can load a SoundFont and use it for ambient sound effects. Customised SoundFonts can be created to personalise the dungeon. The game features three SoundFonts, one of which is loaded at game startup, and Creative offered sample &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; SoundFonts for download.

===Expansions===
An expansion pack, &quot;The Deeper Dungeons&quot;, was released on 26 November 1997. It features fifteen new levels each for single player and multiplayer, and an improved artificial intelligence for the enemies. The Avatar also reappears in the final level. A Direct3D version, which brought improved graphics and 3D acceleration support, and a level editor were released for the game.

&quot;KeeperFX&quot;, an abbreviation of &quot;Fan eXpansion&quot; was released in 2010, and has been regularly updated since. This mod increases compatibility with later versions of Windows, fixes bugs, and adds features such as TCP/IP multiplayer support and higher screen resolution options.

===Re-releases===
The game was re-released in 1998 as &quot;Dungeon Keeper Gold Edition&quot;, which included the &quot;Deeper Dungeons&quot; expansion as well as a &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;-based desktop theme. In Japan, a similar edition was released as &quot;Dungeon Keeper Premium&quot;, under the EA Best Selection brand. This version included the content from the &quot;Gold&quot; release, as well as both Japanese and English text and audio options.

The &quot;Gold&quot; version was re-released into digital distribution on GOG.com in June 2011. GOG.com launched a macOS version in October 2012. The game was available there free of charge for a few days in February 2014. In October 2016, &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; was released free of charge on Origin, via its &quot;On The House&quot; programme.

==Reception==
&quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; received critical acclaim. The gameplay and uniqueness were its most heavily complimented aspects. Chris Lombardi of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; praised the multiplayer mode, saying that it &quot;promises to be extraordinarily rich and subtle&quot;. His conclusion was that &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; is &quot;The most unique game in years; stylish, multifaceted, and as deep as the pits of hell&quot;. Game Revolution reviewer agreed with Lombardi by believing that &quot;Dungeon Keeper is a revolutionary, terrific game&quot;, and also complimented the &quot;terrific&quot; graphics and the &quot;nearly as impressive&quot; sound. Rob Smith of &quot;GamePro&quot; argued that the multiplayer gameplay wasn&#x27;t really a radical departure from other real-time strategy games, but the &quot;bad guy&quot; role and particular sense of humour make it stand-out. He added that the game benefits from strong music, sound effects, and overall depth. Gamezilla&#x27;s Chris McDonald called the game a &quot;classic&quot; and concluded, &quot;Any real-time gamer with a yearning for the dungeon life and the nerve to slaughter an army of Monks, Fairies and Lords will be pleasantly surprised with Dungeon Keeper&quot;. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; UK&#x27;s James Flynn praised Bullfrog&#x27;s attention to detail, calling it &quot;amazing&quot;, and reiterated others&#x27; views by describing &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; as &quot;A stunning achievement&quot;.

In a 2001 review,&quot; PC Zone&quot;, like Gamezilla, called the game &quot;classic&quot;, but also criticised its &quot;repetitive&quot; gameplay. Trent Ward of GameSpot remarked &quot;It&#x27;s a rich strategy game that is both intuitive and challenging, both innovative and polished&quot;, and felt the game was &quot;among the best games released so far this year&quot;. Gamezilla and &quot;PC Zone&quot;″s beliefs were echoed by a reviewer of &quot;Edge&quot;, who described the game as a &quot;masterpiece&quot;. Another reviewer who agreed was from &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;. He described &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; as &quot;totally awesome!&quot;, and praised the flexibility and detail. A reviewer of Jeuxvideo.com commended the replayability and sound effects. Robert Mayer of &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot; complimented the humour, sound, and the 3D view, and liked the elements working together, but criticised the artificial intelligence. &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewer lauded the sense of humour, describing it as typical of Bullfrog, the &quot;dark and edgy&quot; soundtrack, further saying it mixes mediaeval themes with guitar sounds, and the gameplay&#x27;s addictiveness. The only criticism was the &quot;occasionally weak&quot; artificial intelligence. Reviewers from the French magazine &quot;Génération 4&quot; were highly complimentary: one reviewer commented that &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; is in-between &quot;Warcraft&quot; and &quot;Theme Park&quot; due to its creature management and real-time combat, and also believed that it is hard to leave a level after winning. Another reviewer described &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; as &quot;The game of the year!&quot;. The magazine also listed &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; as their top PC CD game of summer 1997.

&quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; was a finalist in the Software Publishers Association&#x27;s 13th Annual Excellence in Software Awards Best of 1997 Codie awards for Best Strategy Software Game. In 1997, &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; appeared #4 on &quot;PC Gamer&quot;″s list of top 100 games, and, in June, was named as their Game Of The Month. In June 2014, &quot;The Guardian&quot; listed &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; as one of Britain&#x27;s 30 greatest video games.

At the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; inaugural Interactive Achievement Awards (now known as the D.I.C.E. Awards), &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; won &quot;PC Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot; and was nominated for &quot;Computer Entertainment Title of the Year&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Interactive Design&quot;.

===Sales===
During 1997, &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; sold 113,407 copies in the United States alone. It received a &quot;Gold&quot; award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD) in August 1998, for sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The game&#x27;s global sales reached 700,000 copies by 2003. Molyneux considered it a &quot;missed opportunity&quot; in comparison to his earlier games such as &quot;Theme Park&quot;, which sold millions of units.

===Impact and legacy===
Many reviews of video games that have similar elements mention &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; as both an influence for the designers and a standard for comparison. These include:
* 1999&#x27;s &quot;Lego Rock Raiders&quot;. According to &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;, this was asserted to be &quot;the ultimate sequel to &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;&quot;.
* 2001&#x27;s &quot;Startopia&quot;. This game was developed by Mucky Foot Productions, which consisted of staff from Bullfrog. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; said that &quot;they&#x27;d taken &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; and set it in space&quot;.
* 2004&#x27;s &quot;Evil Genius&quot;, the second game developed by Elixir Studios. Players control a James Bond-style lair and construct military and scientific installations, with the goal of expansion.
* 2003&#x27;s &quot;Ghost Master&quot;, in which players play the role of the enemy.
* 2007&#x27;s &quot;Holy Invasion of Privacy, Badman!&quot;, another game in which players construct a dungeon and protect it from invading heroes. It was described as &quot;Dungeon Keeper meets Dig Dug&quot;.
* 2011&#x27;s &quot;Dungeons&quot; but with focus on care of the heroes instead of the monsters.
* 2011&#x27;s &quot;Dungeon Overlord&quot;, an Adobe Flash application via the social-networking website Facebook.
* 2013&#x27;s &quot;Impire&quot; has been called &quot;Dungeon Keeper with a side of &quot;Dawn of War&quot;&quot;.
* 2013&#x27;s &quot;The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot&quot; has been called &quot;A weird combination of &quot;Diablo&quot; and &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;&quot;.
* 2015&#x27;s &quot;War for the Overworld&quot; is a project held by its creators Subterranean Games as &quot;a true spiritual successor to &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;&quot;.
* 2015&#x27;s &quot;Dungeons 2&quot; has been described as a combination between &quot;Dungeon Keeper and an RTS&quot;.

&quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; was referenced in &quot;Theme Hospital&quot;″s introduction scene twice: a doctor is briefly seen playing a console version, and the Horned Reaper makes a cameo appearance as a patient. Early concept art for &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; used &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;″s Horned Reaper to represent creatures. The Horned Reaper unit was so popular that the producers of &quot;Dungeon Keeper 2&quot; made it a character with an important role in the game&#x27;s story. &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;″s engine was an inspiration for &quot;Minecraft&quot;.

<text>Don George Berry (January 23, 1932 – February 20, 2001) was an American author and artist best known for his trilogy of historical novels about early settlers in the Oregon Country. Described as one of &quot;Oregon&#x27;s best fiction writers of the post-World War II generation&quot;, and a &quot;Forgotten Beat&quot;, Berry&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Moontrap&quot; (1962), was nominated for the National Book Award in 1963.

== Early life and education ==
Berry was born in Redwood Falls, Minnesota, the son of a banjo player and a swing band singer who separated when Berry was 2 years old. Berry moved to Oregon with his mother when he was still in his teens, living in the Vanport housing project and attending Roosevelt High School, where he was elected student body president. Following the catastrophic Vanport flood of May 30, 1948, Berry discovered his name erroneously included in the list of over 2,000 missing, a fact which Berry took advantage of to break off ties with his alcoholic mother. After winning a scholarship in mathematics, Berry enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon, which he attended from 1949 to 1951, taking classes with the noted calligrapher Lloyd Reynolds and historian Dorothy Johansen. To support himself during this time, worked in the university bookstore and slept in the boiler room, which he had been hired to tend. After befriending the poet Gary Snyder, who shared Berry&#x27;s interest in Eastern literature and metaphysics, Berry was invited to move into the basement of 1414 Lambert Street, a house about a mile off campus, where he would live for the next two years. Other residents of the house would include the poets Lew Welch and Philip Whalen, also students at Reed.

Together with Snyder, Welch, and Whalen, who would later informally come to be known as the West Coast Beats, Berry formed the Adelaide Crapsey-Oswald Spengler Mutual Admiration Poetasters Society, devoted to &quot;[drinking] wine, [writing] poetry, and goof[ing] off&quot;. During this period, Berry also met his future wife, the artist and author Kajira Wyn Berry.

== Career ==

=== Science fiction ===
In 1956, after 144 rejection letters, Berry sold his first science fiction story, &quot;Routine for a Hornet&quot;, which was published in the December issue of &quot;If&quot; magazine. Over the next two years, Berry published 9 more science fiction stories in various magazines, abandoning the genre with the launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik in 1957, which he claimed marked the &quot;death of science fiction.&quot;

=== Historical novels and nonfiction ===
In the late 1950s, Berry completed his first novel, &quot;Trask&quot; (1960), a historical account of a fictional episode from the life Elbridge Trask, an Oregon settler in the 1840s who became one of the first white homesteaders on Tillamook Bay. While Hal Borland praised the book for showing &quot;an unusual understanding of the old-time mountain men and Indians and the basic drama of change in the Pacific Northwest&quot;, he faulted it for getting &quot;somewhat lost In the obscurities or mysticism and the Inner conflicts of inarticulate white men.&quot; More recently however, the spiritual themes of the book have been subject to a critical reappraisal, with Therése Jörgne completing a phenomenological study of the novel in 2012.

&quot;Trask&quot; was published in hardcover by the New York-based publishing house Viking Books in 1960, and in paperback later the same year by Ballantine, later being re-issued by Comstock Editions. Although some paperback editions of the novel were retitled &quot;Trask: the coast of Oregon, 1848&quot;, the 2004 re-issue of the book by Oregon State University Press was published under Berry&#x27;s original title&quot;.&quot;

Berry followed up on the success of &quot;Trask&quot; with &quot;A Majority of Scoundrels&quot; (Harper and Brother, 1961), which provides an &quot;informal history&quot; of the fur trade in the Rocky Mountains through the story of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company.

Berry&#x27;s second historical novel set in the Oregon Country, &quot;Moontrap&quot; (1962), was perhaps his best known in his lifetime, having been nominated for the National Book Award in 1963. &quot;Moontrap&quot; depicts the difficult transition from fur trapping to farming, as experienced by a group of fur trappers and their Native American wives facing off against civic-minded entrepreneurs and the end of frontier justice.

Like his first two Oregon County novels, the final book in Berry&#x27;s Oregon Country trilogy, &quot;To Build a Ship&quot; (1963) is based on the diary of Warren Vaughn (1823-1907), an early settler who first arrived in the Tillamook area in December 1852, travelling by foot along the Native American trail over Neahkahnie Mountain and Tillamook Head from Astoria.

According to his wife, Berry later completed a sequel to &quot;Trask&quot;, which he burned.

=== Documentaries ===
In the late 1960s, Berry was hired to work as a screenwriter and music producer in the film department of KGW, a Portland affiliate of Seattle&#x27;s KING 5 TV, where he worked with the Hungarian-born filmmaker László Pal. The pair would go on to co-produce a number of documentary films, including &quot;Crab Fisherman&quot;, &quot;Survivor at One O&#x27;Clock&quot;, and &quot;Blue Water Hunters&quot; (1988).

=== Berryworks ===
After many years without publishing fiction, in the final six years of his life Berry became early adopter of the Internet for writing, posting dozens of short stories, humorous anecdotes, and philosophical essays to his personal website, &quot;Berryworks&quot;. Although the site is no longer maintained, this large body of literature, which includes a memoir and an unfinished fantasy novel set in Minoan Crete has been preserved thanks to the Internet Archive.

== Personal life ==
Following Berry and Wyn&#x27;s marriage in 1957, Berry became a step-father to three children from a previous marriage. David, Bonny and Duncan (oldest to youngest) are the names of his step-children. In the mid-1960s, the family moved to the Oregon coast, where they spent several years living off the land in a rustic cabin. After a period of touring the Caribbean on a 55 foot ketch, the family moved to Vashon Island in 1974, living on a boat before moving into a home in the inner harbor. Berry and Wyn separated in 1987, and Berry returned to living on boat in 1995, an experience which he describes in his nonfiction memoir, &quot;Magic Harbor&quot; (1995-2001). Besides writing, Berry&#x27;s lifelong artistic pursuits included bronze sculpture, sumi-e painting, and blues guitar playing. He died in Seattle in 2001.

<text>Zabid () (also spelled Zabīd, Zabeed and Zebid) is a town with an urban population of around 52,590 people, located on Yemen&#x27;s western coastal plain. It is one of the oldest towns in Yemen, and has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1993. However, in 2000, the site was placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger. The town was the capital of several ruling dynasties in Yemen over many centuries.

==History==
The town is one of the oldest in Yemen. It was originally a village known as al-Husayb that was inhabited by the Asha&#x27;ir tribe. It later took on the name of the Wadi Zabid, the valley to its south. According to tradition, the town&#x27;s early history is associated with Abu Musa al-Ash&#x27;ari, one of the companions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, who is said to have built the al-Asha&#x27;ir Mosque as the fifth mosque in the history of Islam. 

The present town was created circa 820 by Muhammad ibn Abdallah ibn Ziyad, the founder of the Ziyadid dynasty, who had been sent by the Abbasid caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun to suppress a rebellion of the Asha&#x27;ir and Akk tribes. It became the capital of the Ziyadids (up to 1016) and continued to serve this role under their successors, the Najahid dynasty (from 1022 to 1158) and the Mahdids (1158 to 1174). During this time the city grew in importance. Its mosques, including the al-Asha&#x27;ir Mosque and the Great Mosque, became centers of Islamic learning. Its location on the road between Mecca and Aden also granted the city economic prosperity.

In 1067, during the pilgrimage to Mecca, the Banu Najah clan under Sa&#x27;id Ibn Najah, the prince of Zabid, attacked the travel party of the Sulayhid sultan, Ali al-Sulayhi, and his wife Asma bint Shihab. They killed Ali and took Asma prisoner. She was sequestered in a secret prison in Zabid, and the severed head of her spouse was reportedly planted on a pole visible from her cell. After a year&#x27;s imprisonment, she managed to get a message through to her son and daughter-in-law in Sanaa, and her son stormed Zabid and freed her.

Ali ibn Mahdi, a native of the Yemeni highlands, founded the Mahdid dynasty in the Tihama region. Al-Himyari and his followers burned down several districts north of Zabid. He had sworn to put the Abyssinians into slavery and ordered his men to kill everyone, including the handicapped. Out of desperation, the people of Zabid sought assistance from the Zaydi imam Ahmed ibn Sulayman against al-Himyari. The Zaydi imam ordered Fatiq III to be executed on account of his alleged homosexuality. Fatiq III was either killed by the Imam, the Mahdids, or his own soldiers. With this event, the slave dynasty came an end and the Mahdids took over Zabid in 1158.

After the Ayyubids took control of Yemen in 1174, Zabid continued to be the economic and political center of the region. Under the Rasulid dynasty (1229–1454), the official capital was moved to Ta&#x27;izz but the rulers continued to use Zabid as a winter residence. The city reached its apogee during this period and had a larger number of palaces, gardens, and religious institutions than any other city in Yemen. Al-Khazraji, a local 14th-century Arab writer, claimed that the city counted between 230 and 240 mosques. Even today, the city reportedly has the highest concentration of mosques in Yemen.

Hadım Suleiman Pasha extended the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s authority to include Zabid in 1539. Zabid became the administrative headquarters of Yemen Eyalet.

Today, however, Zabid is at the intellectual and economic margins of modern Yemen. Muhammad Abdul-Wali&#x27;s novel &quot;Sana&#x27;a: An Open City&quot; tells the story of a young man who traveled to Zabid in the mid-20th century and was surprised to find the town had become a backwater.

==Geography==
Zabid has an urban population of around 52,590 persons. It is located on Yemen&#x27;s western coastal plain, in the Tihama region.

==World Heritage Site==
Zabid was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1993. Zabid&#x27;s Great Mosque occupies a prominent place in the town. The vestiges of its university can also be visited. In 2000, Zabid was listed on the List of World Heritage in Danger; the listing was made at the behest of the Yemeni government due to a state of poor upkeep and conservation. According to a UNESCO report, roughly &quot;40% of the city&#x27;s houses have been replaced by concrete buildings, and other houses and the ancient souk are in a deteriorating state. The ongoing Yemeni civil war also poses a threat to Zabid&#x27;s heritage. Some historic homes were damaged by coalition bombing in 2015. Further concerns were raised in 2018 as fighting drew near to the city.

==Economy==
As of 1920, Zabid was one of two places in Arabia growing indigo. Zabid also grows and produces cotton. The British cite tribal disputes as dampening the economy in Zabid during the early 20th century.

<doc id="738356" wikidata="Q1400386" url="?curid=738356" title="Harold L. Ickes">
<text>Harold LeClair Ickes ( ; March 15, 1874 – February 3, 1952) was an American administrator, politician and lawyer. He served as United States Secretary of the Interior for nearly 13 years from 1933 to 1946, the longest tenure of anyone to hold the office, and the second longest-serving Cabinet member in U.S. history after James Wilson. Ickes and Labor Secretary Frances Perkins were the only original members of the Roosevelt cabinet who remained in office for his entire presidency.

Ickes was responsible for implementing much of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;New Deal&quot;. He was in charge of the major relief program the Public Works Administration (PWA) and in charge of the federal government&#x27;s environmental efforts.

In his day, he was considered a prominent liberal spokesman, a skillful orator and a noted supporter of many African-American causes, although he at times yielded to political expediency where state-level segregation was concerned. Before his national-level political career, in which he did remove segregation in areas of his direct control, he had been the president of the Chicago NAACP. Ickes had supported an American invasion of Francoist Spain before the Allied invasion of North Africa in Operation Torch.

Robert C. Weaver, who in 1966 became the first African-American person to hold a cabinet position in the U.S., was in the &quot;Black Kitchen Cabinet&quot;, Ickes&#x27; group of advisers on race relations.

Ickes was the father of Harold M. Ickes, White House Deputy Chief of Staff for President Bill Clinton.

==Early years==
Of Scottish and German ancestry, Ickes was born in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, the son of Matilda (McCune) and Jesse Boone Williams Ickes. He and his entire family lived in nearby Altoona, Pennsylvania. At the age of 16 his mother died. Leaving behind his father and three other siblings in Altoona, Ickes and his younger sister moved in with an aunt in Chicago where he attended Englewood High School. He was the class president while at Englewood. After graduating, he worked his way through the University of Chicago, finishing with a B.A. in 1897. At Chicago, Ickes was a charter member re-establishing the Illinois Beta Chapter of Phi Delta Theta.

He first worked as a newspaper reporter for &quot;The Chicago Record&quot; and later for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. He obtained a J.D. degree from the University of Chicago Law School in 1907 but rarely practiced. One notable case was the death of Lazarus Averbuch. He became active in reform politics, especially on behalf of John Maynard Harlan in Republican politics. 

===First World War===
From 1917 to 1918 he served with the YMCA in France while the organization was stationed with the 35th Infantry Division of the American Expeditionary Forces.

==Politics==

Initially a Republican in Chicago, Ickes was never part of the establishment. He was unsatisfied with Republican policies and joined Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Bull Moose movement in 1912. After returning to the Republican fold, he campaigned for progressive Republicans Charles Evans Hughes (1916) and Hiram Johnson (1920 and 1924). He later served as the Illinois manager of Hugh S. Magill&#x27;s United States Senate campaign in 1926.

He fought lengthy and legendary battles first with Chicago figures Samuel Insull, the utilities magnate, William Hale Thompson, the mayor, and Robert R. McCormick, the owner of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot;. Later he had an ongoing battle with Thomas E. Dewey, the presidential candidate.

Although active in Chicago politics, he was unknown nationally until 1933. As part of this involvement, Ickes was involved in Chicago&#x27;s social and political affairs; among his many activities include his work for the City Club of Chicago. He was also involved in state and county politics serving on state councils and party committees. He served as president of the People&#x27;s Protective League of Illinois in 1922. He was a member of the Roosevelt Memorial Association and later vice president of the Roosevelt Memorial Association of Greater Chicago. He later served on the National Conservation Committee and on the board of advisers of the Quetico-Superior Council. He served as chairman of the People&#x27;s Traction League in 1929.

After Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected president in 1932, he began putting together his cabinet. His advisers thought the Democratic president needed a progressive Republican to attract middle-of-the-road voters. Roosevelt offered the position to New Mexico Senator Bronson Cutting, who ultimately declined the position due to his unstable health. Roosevelt then sought out Hiram Johnson, a Republican Senator at the time who had supported Roosevelt in the campaign, but Johnson was uninterested. Johnson, however, recommended an old ally, Ickes.

==Secretary of the Interior==

Ickes served simultaneously in several major roles for Roosevelt. Although he was the Secretary of the Interior, he was better known to the public for his simultaneous work as the director of the Public Works Administration, where he directed billions of dollars of projects designed to lure private investment and provide employment during the depths of the Great Depression. His management of the PWA budget and his opposition to corruption earned him the name &quot;Honest Harold.&quot; He regularly presented projects to Roosevelt for the President&#x27;s personal approval, but also clashed no less often with FDR and other Cabinet colleagues, being noted for combativeness in debate.

Ickes&#x27; support of PWA power plants put increased financial pressure on private power companies during the Great Depression, which had both positive and negative effects. He tried to enforce the Raker Act against the city of San Francisco, an act of Congress that specified that because the dam at Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park was on public land, no private profit could be derived from the development. The city continued selling the power to PG&amp;E, which then resold it at a profit.

In 1937, Ickes expanded the boundaries of Yosemite National Park through a direct government purchase of a tract owned by the Yosemite Sugar Pine Company. This had the effect of ending large-scale commercial logging in the park.

In July 1938, Ickes wrote a letter to then President Roosevelt, imploring him not to turn Palmyra Atoll over to the US Navy for use as a military base. Quoting his letter, he writes,

... the Navy Department has plans for the acquisition and development of the island as an air base. Our representatives have studied conditions at Palmyra and other islands in the south Pacific, and they report that use of this small land area as an air base for Navy Department purposes would undoubtedly destroy much if not all that makes the island one of our most scientifically and scenically unique possessions.

The letter was unsuccessful, and plans for the base proceeded, but he was by all accounts the first official to propose that Palmyra Atoll become a national monument. Today the atoll is part of the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument, and despite suffering the kind of damage Ickes predicted, it has recovered and is used regularly for scientific study, having still retained what Ickes also described in his letter as &quot;geologic and biologic exhibits ... of great beauty and scientific importance&quot;.

He was instrumental in establishing the Kings Canyon National Park, commissioning Ansel Adams as a &#x27;photographic muralist&#x27; in an ambitious public relations project that Ickes had himself conceived to document and communicate, on a visceral level, the outstanding beauty of the parks for the public to see, and indirectly but effectively persuading the Congress to support the bill to President Roosevelt in 1940.

After the loss of the German passenger Zeppelin &quot;Hindenburg&quot; in 1937, the Zeppelin Company director Dr. Hugo Eckener sought to obtain inert helium from the United States to replace the highly flammable hydrogen gas for use in their future airships. At the time, the United States held a monopoly on helium and the Zeppelin company could not obtain the gas from other sources. Ickes opposed the sale although practically every other member of the Cabinet supported it along with the President himself. Ickes remained adamant in his opposition, fearing Germany would use the helium in military dirigibles. Eckener refused to risk passenger safety with the continued use of hydrogen and as a result, Zeppelin passenger service came to an end.

The Saudi Aramco oil corporation, with Ickes&#x27; assistance, got Roosevelt to agree to Lend-Lease aid to Saudi Arabia, which would involve the U.S. government in protecting American interests there and create a shield for ARAMCO.

Due to a projected oil shortage between June and October 1941, Ickes issued orders to close gasoline stations in the Eastern United States between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m.

Ickes was a powerful orator and the only man in the Roosevelt Administration who could rebut John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers, who often delivered radio addresses critical of the Roosevelt administration.

===Segregation and civil rights===

Ickes was a strong supporter of both civil rights and civil liberties. He had been the president of the Chicago National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and supported African American contralto Marian Anderson when the Daughters of the American Revolution prohibited her from performing in DAR Constitution Hall. Ickes was the organizer and master of ceremonies at Anderson&#x27;s subsequent concert at the Lincoln Memorial.

In 1933, Ickes ended segregation in the cafeteria and rest rooms of his department, including the national parks around the country. He encouraged private contractors working for the PWA to hire both skilled and unskilled blacks. Robert C. Weaver, who in 1966 became the first black person to hold a cabinet position, was one of his advisers on race relations, a group known as the &quot;Black Kitchen Cabinet.&quot; White attitudes toward blacks evolved little in the 1930s, and Ickes did not try to speed up the change, arguing that first there needed to be emergency relief and the upgrading of black skills.

In 1937, when Senator Josiah Bailey, Democrat of North Carolina, accused him of trying to break down segregation laws, Ickes wrote him that he worked towards and foresaw equality but did not waste his energy on state-level segregation:

In 1941 Ickes paved the way for the National Park Service to desegregate its facilities in the nation&#x27;s capital after a group of black men came to play mini-golf at East Potomac Park Golf Course and were verbally harassed by the patrons of the then white-only facility. He did so the day after this event and almost fourteen years before Brown v. Board of Education.

He complained in his diary about the Japanese American internment in 1942, but made no public protest.

===World-level colonial independence===

As an official delegate to the founding United Nations conference in San Francisco, presided over by Acting Secretary General Alger Hiss, Ickes advocated for stronger language promoting self-rule and eventual independence for the world&#x27;s colonies.

===Jewish refugees in Alaska===

In a news conference on the eve of Thanksgiving 1938, Ickes proposed offering Alaska as a &quot;haven for Jewish refugees from Germany and other areas in Europe where the Jews are subjected to oppressive restrictions.&quot; The proposal was designed to bypass normal immigration quotas, because Alaska was not a state. Ickes had toured Alaska that summer, meeting with local officials to discuss how to attract greater development, both for economic reasons and to bolster security in an area so close to Japan and Russia and to develop a plan to attract international professionals, including European Jews. In his press conference, he pointed out that 200 families had been relocated from the Dust Bowl to Alaska&#x27;s Matanuska-Susitna Valley.

The Department of the Interior prepared a report detailing the advantages of the plan, which was introduced as a bill by Utah&#x27;s Senator William H. King and California&#x27;s Democratic Representative Franck R. Havenner. The plan met with little support from American Jews, however, with the exception of the Labor Zionists of America; most Jews agreed with Rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise of the American Jewish Congress that the plan, if implemented, would deliver &quot;a wrong and hurtful impression ... that Jews are taking over some part of the country for settlement.&quot;

The final blow was dealt when Roosevelt suggested a limit of only 10,000 immigrants a year for five years, with a maximum of 10 percent Jews. He later reduced even that number and never publicly mentioned the plan.

===Pauley dispute===
Although Ickes stayed on in President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s cabinet after Roosevelt died in April 1945, he resigned from office within a year. In February 1946, Truman nominated Edwin W. Pauley to be Secretary of the Navy. Pauley was the former Democratic Party national treasurer. He once suggested to Ickes that $300,000 in campaign funds could be raised if Ickes would drop his fight for title to oil-rich offshore lands. Ickes testified to this during Pauley&#x27;s Senate confirmation hearing. This led to a heated confrontation with Truman, who suggested that Ickes&#x27; memory might have been faulty.

Ickes wrote a 2,000-word letter of resignation, which read in part: &quot;I don&#x27;t care to stay in an Administration where I am expected to commit perjury for the sake of the party... I do not have a reputation for dealing recklessly with the truth.&quot; Truman accepted his resignation and gave Ickes three days to vacate his office. Soon afterward, Pauley declined the nomination.

==After government==
Ickes had bought a working farm, Headwaters Farm, near Olney, Maryland, in 1937. His wife Jane managed the farm and Ickes grew flowers as a hobby. President Roosevelt spent occasional weekends there before the establishment of &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, the presidential retreat now known as Camp David.

After he resigned from the Cabinet in 1946, Ickes retired to his farm but remained active on the political scene, working as a syndicated columnist. In December 1945, Ickes accepted the position of executive chairman of the newly founded Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions (ICCASP), a group that criticized Truman&#x27;s lack of fidelity to FDR&#x27;s principles. A thousand people attended the hotel banquet that celebrated his appointment. He resigned on February 13, 1946, unhappy with the organization&#x27;s failure to pay him the agreed-upon salary and unwilling to support the organization of a new political party to support Henry Wallace&#x27;s presidential race. he died in 1952.

==Critiques and battles==
Ickes was known for his acerbic wit and took joy in verbal battles. He often took verbal abuse too. For instance, Roosevelt selected Ickes to deliver a response following the nomination of Wendell Willkie. In response to Ickes&#x27; comments, Senator Styles Bridges called Ickes &quot;a common scold puffed up by high office.&quot; Republican Congresswoman Clare Boothe Luce once famously remarked that Ickes had &quot;the mind of a commissar and the soul of a meataxe.&quot;

In September 1944, Thomas E. Dewey, the Republican nominee for president, promised to fire Ickes if elected. Ickes penned a letter of resignation to Dewey and it was widely printed in the press. Ickes wrote, in part:

==Personal life==
Ickes married divorcee Anna Wilmarth Thompson in 1911. He had one son, Raymond Wilmarth Ickes (1912–2000) with Anna. He was a stepfather to two children from Anna&#x27;s previous marriage, her biological son Wilmarth Thompson, and her adopted daughter Frances Thompson. Ickes and Anna also adopted son Robert Harold Ickes (1913–1971). Anna died in an automobile accident on August 31, 1935. His 37-year-old adopted son Wilmarth Ickes killed himself in the family&#x27;s suburban Chicago home on the same day the following year. Secretary Ickes declined to comment to &quot;The New York Times&quot; on his son&#x27;s death.

At the age of 64, he married 25-year-old Jane Dahlman (1913–1972), the younger sister of Wilmarth Ickes&#x27; wife, Betty, on May 24, 1938. Children resulting from this marriage were daughter Elizabeth Jane and son Harold McEwen Ickes, who became Deputy Chief of Staff under Bill Clinton.

==Honors &amp; awards==

There was a Chicago Housing Authority public housing project on the south side of Chicago named the Harold L. Ickes Homes. Built between 1954 and 1955, the buildings have since been demolished.

The Harold Ickes Playground, a 1.82-acre park located in the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City, is named in his honor.

Mount Ickes in Kings Canyon National Park was named in his honor in 1964.

He was awarded the Brandeis Medal for service to humanity in 1940 and the Pugsley Medal for distinguished park service in the United States in 1941.

==Pronunciation and spelling of name==
Asked how to say his name, he told &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; &quot;I think you come as close as anybody when you suggest that it rhymes with &quot;sickness&quot; with the &quot;n&quot; omitted. The &quot;e&quot; is halfway between a short &quot;e&quot; and short &quot;u&quot;&quot;: hence, . His son Harold M. Ickes, however, pronounces the name . The correct spelling of Ickes&#x27; middle name is undetermined. It is sometimes spelled Le Clair, Le Claire or LeClare.

==In fiction==
*In the 1942 film &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;, James Cagney (as George M. Cohan) sings a satirical song about the Roosevelt Administration, which includes a reference to &quot;Mr. Ickes&quot;. In that rendering, he pronounces it the way the son does: IK-eez.
*In the 1977 musical play &quot;Annie&quot;, Roosevelt demands that Ickes sing &quot;Tomorrow&quot; in the Oval Office, and orders him to get louder. Ickes was largely a comic figure in the play, despite acting rude, vulgar, and arrogant. Annie helps him to sing, and he gets somewhat carried away. He ends the song on his knees, much to the dismay of the Cabinet and the President.
*In Michael Chabon&#x27;s 2007 alternative history &quot;The Yiddish Policemen&#x27;s Union&quot;, Harold Ickes plays a key part in the backstory.

<text>James Edward Ingram (February 16, 1952 – January 29, 2019) was an American singer, songwriter and record producer. He was a two-time Grammy Award-winner and a two-time Academy Award nominee for Best Original Song. After beginning his career in 1973, Ingram charted eight top 40 hits on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart from the early 1980s until the early 1990s, as well as thirteen top 40 hits on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. In addition, he charted 20 hits on the Adult Contemporary chart (including two number-ones). He had two number-one singles on the Hot 100: the first, a duet with fellow R&amp;B artist Patti Austin, 1982&#x27;s &quot;Baby, Come to Me&quot; topped the U.S. pop chart in 1983; &quot;I Don&#x27;t Have the Heart&quot;, which became his second number-one in 1990 was his only number-one as a solo artist.

In between these hits, he also recorded the song &quot;Somewhere Out There&quot; with fellow recording artist Linda Ronstadt for the animated film &quot;An American Tail&quot;. The song and the music video both became hits. Ingram co-wrote &quot;The Day I Fall in Love&quot;, from the motion picture &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s 2nd&quot; (1993), and singer Patty Smyth&#x27;s &quot;Look What Love Has Done&quot;, from the motion picture &quot;Junior&quot; (1994), which earned him nominations for Best Original Song from the Oscars, Golden Globes, and Grammy Awards in 1994 and 1995.

== Early life ==
Ingram was born in Akron, Ohio, where he attended Akron&#x27;s East High School and received a track scholarship to the University of Akron. Subsequently, he moved to Los Angeles and played with the band Revelation Funk, which made an appearance in the Rudy Ray Moore film &quot;Dolemite&quot;. He also later played keyboards for Ray Charles before becoming famous. James Ingram received his first publishing deal with 20th Century Fox publishing company, which is where he sang the $50 demo for &quot;Just Once&quot;.

== Career ==

Ingram provided the vocals to &quot;Just Once&quot; and &quot;One Hundred Ways&quot; on Quincy Jones&#x27;s 1981 album &quot;The Dude&quot;, which earned Ingram triple Grammy nominations, including Best New Artist. &quot;One Hundred Ways&quot; won him the Grammy Award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance for his work. On December 11, 1981, Ingram appeared as a guest on the Canadian comedy series &quot;SCTV&quot; (which aired on NBC), singing &quot;Just Once&quot;. Ingram&#x27;s debut album, &quot;It&#x27;s Your Night&quot;, was released in 1983 and included the ballad &quot;There&#x27;s No Easy Way&quot;. He worked with other notable artists such as Donna Summer, Ray Charles, Anita Baker, Viktor Lazlo, Nancy Wilson, Natalie Cole, Kim Carnes, and Kenny Rogers. In October 1990, he scored a No. 1 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with the love ballad &quot;I Don&#x27;t Have the Heart&quot;, from his &quot;It&#x27;s Real&quot; album.

In 1984, Ingram received three additional Grammy nominations: &quot;How Do You Keep the Music Playing?&quot; (his second duet with recording artist Patti Austin), for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals; the US Top 10 single, &quot;P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)&quot; for Michael Jackson, which Ingram and Quincy Jones co-wrote, for Best R&amp;B Song; and the track &quot;Party Animal&quot; for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance. In early 1985, he was nominated for his debut album (&quot;It&#x27;s Your Night&quot;) for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance, and for its single, &quot;Yah Mo B There&quot; (a duet with fellow R&amp;B musician Michael McDonald), for Best R&amp;B Song and Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group, and won the latter.

Ingram is perhaps best known for his hit collaborations with other vocalists. He scored a No. 1 hit on the Hot 100 chart in February 1983 with Patti Austin on the duet &quot;Baby, Come to Me&quot;, a song made popular on TV&#x27;s &quot;General Hospital&quot;. A second Austin–Ingram duet, &quot;How Do You Keep the Music Playing?&quot;, was featured in the movie &quot;Best Friends&quot; (1982) and earned an Oscar nomination. In 1984, he teamed up with Kenny Rogers and Kim Carnes for the Top 40 ballad &quot;What About Me?&quot; In 1985, Ingram won a Grammy Award for &quot;Yah Mo B There&quot;, a duet with Michael McDonald, and participated in the charity project &quot;We Are the World&quot;.

Ingram teamed with American vocalist Linda Ronstadt and had a million-selling #2 hit in the U.S. and a Top 10 U.K. hit in 1987 with &quot;Somewhere Out There&quot;, the theme from the animated feature film &quot;An American Tail&quot;. The song was awarded the 1987 Grammy Award for Song of the Year. It also received Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations. It was one of the last million-selling Gold-certified 45 RPM singles to be issued by the RIAA.

In the 1990s, Ingram&#x27;s highest-profile team-up came again with Quincy Jones, on the song &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;. This song also featured vocals by Barry White, El DeBarge, and Al B. Sure!. Soundtrack songs were popular for Ingram in the 1990s. From the movie &quot;Sarafina!&quot; came &quot;One More Time&quot;, and from &quot;City Slickers&quot; came &quot;Where Did My Heart Go?&quot; In 1991, he and Melissa Manchester performed the song &quot;The Brightest Star&quot; in the animated Christmas film &quot;Precious Moments Timmy&#x27;s Gift&quot;. In 1993, they performed the song again in the film&#x27;s sequel &quot;Precious Moments Timmy&#x27;s Special Delivery&quot;. Ingram&#x27;s 1994 composition &quot;The Day I Fall in Love&quot;, a duet with Dolly Parton, was the theme song for the movie &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s 2nd&quot; and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. Ingram and Parton performed the song live on the Oscar broadcast. In 1997, he and Carnie Wilson co-wrote the song &quot;Our Time Has Come&quot; and lent it to the animated film &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot;.

During the summer of 2004, Ingram participated in the U.S. television reality show &quot;Celebrity Duets&quot; as a duet partner. The show combined professional vocalists, of various musical genres, with entertainers of different backgrounds in a weekly elimination competition. In 2006, Ingram and neo-soul singer Angie Stone teamed up on &quot;My People&quot;. In 2011, Ingram joined Cliff Richard&#x27;s list of special guest performers on his &quot;Soulicious&quot; Tour performing at various UK venues during November. He sang two songs from the album with Richard, as well a solo of &quot;Just Once&quot;. In 2012, Ingram appeared as himself in the ABC television show &quot;Suburgatory&quot;, in the episode &quot;The Motherload&quot;. Also in 2012, he was a guest vocalist at Debbie Allen&#x27;s October 13 live show at the corner of Crenshaw Blvd. and Martin Luther King Blvd. celebrating the arrival of the &quot;Space Shuttle Endeavour&quot;, singing R. Kelly&#x27;s &quot;I Believe I Can Fly&quot;.

<text>Henry Clay Ide (September 18, 1844 – June 13, 1921) was a U.S. judge, colonial commissioner, ambassador, and Governor-General of the Philippines.

== Biography ==
=== Early life, States Attorney, Senator, and Presidential Commissioner to Samoa ===
Ide was born in Barnet, Vermont, on September 18, 1844, a son of Jacob and Lodoiska (Knights) Ide. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1866, where he was named valedictorian. He studied law, first with Benjamin H. Steele, and later with Jonathan Ross, and was admitted to the bar in 1870. He practiced law in St. Johnsbury, Vermont from until 1891, and was the partner of Wendell Phillips Stafford. Among the prospective attorneys who studied law in their office was William H. Taylor, who later served as an Associate Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court.

A Republican, from 1876 to 1878, Ide was State&#x27;s Attorney for Caledonia County. From 1882 to 1885 he was a member of the Vermont State Senate.

President Benjamin Harrison appointed Ide Presidential Commissioner to Samoa in 1891. The formal title of the post was American Land Commissioner in Samoa, one of three representatives (of the United States, Germany, and Great Britain) responsible for adjudicating land claims by foreigners in the islands, as provided for in the Treaty of Berlin (1889). Ide reached Apia on May 16, 1891, but only held the office for six months, until he resigned because of a serious illness in his family and left the islands on November 12, 1891. Robert Louis Stevenson wrote to him two days beforehand, saying &quot;I hear with great regret of your departure. They say there are as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it, but I doubt if they will come to our hook. It is not only that you have shown so much capacity, moderation, tact, and temper; but you have had the talent to make these gifts recognized and appreciated among our very captious population. For my part, I always thought your presence the best thing that the treaty had brought us.&quot;

Ide returned to the islands in 1893 as Chief Justice, another position provided for by the Treaty of Berlin. He accepted the appointment in August, and sailed for the islands two months later. As Chief Justice, Ide presided over trials of both native Samoans and foreign nationals of the three Treaty of Berlin signatories. He also had the power to recommend criminal and taxation legislation to the government of Samoa. He resigned in 1896, but there was a delay in the arrival of his successor, requiring him to continue in office until 1897. At his departure, the &quot;Samoa Weekly Herald&quot; editorialized that Ide had been a just and able judge. Similarly, King Malietoa told Ide that &quot;You will not be forgotten in Samoa, you will be remembered as the good Chief Justice who knew our ways and laws and customs and who was kind to us&quot;.

Ide was succeeded as Land Commissioner and Chief Justice by William Lea Chambers.

=== Presidential Commissioner to the Philippines ===

Ide was one of the Commissioners of the Taft Commission, appointed in 1900. Like the other Commissioners, he arrived in the Philippines in June of that year, and assumed official legislative power on 1900-09-01.

In 1901, Ide and the other commissioners gained executive power when they were appointed to the cabinet of territorial Governor William Howard Taft. Ide was appointed Secretary of Finance and Justice, and served until 1904.

Ide was appointed Vice-Governor of the Philippines in 1904. In November 1905 he became Acting Governor General after Luke Wright, then Governor General, took leave. Wright formally resigned in April 1906, and Ide formally succeeded him Governor-General.

Ide was Governor-General until September, when he resigned and was recalled to Washington D.C. In part, Ide&#x27;s few months as Governor-General were a political face-saving exercise (as was Wright&#x27;s resignation). Taft had visited the Philippines in August 1905, and after that visit that Taft intended major changes to the Philippine Commission. Wright and Ide were two of the Commissioners he intended to replace, and allowing Wright to resign and Ide to serve briefly as Governor-General were seen by contemporary observers as face-saving moves. The issue Taft sought to solve was a conflict between the Commission members and the Federalistas. The Federalistas disagreed with and disliked both Wright and Ide. However, while they found Wright&#x27;s Governor-Generalship outright offensive, they were happier with Ide&#x27;s ten months in office. Hailing his resignation from office, &quot;La Democracia&quot; (as quoted in the September 5, 1906 &quot;Manila Times&quot;) praised Ide and his work, and stated that &quot;in his social relations, Mr. Ide has reestablished the good times of Taft, which the latter&#x27;s successor tried to make us forget&quot;.

=== Ambassador ===
Ide served as minister to Spain 1909–1913.

=== Family, personal life, and business affairs ===
On October 26, 1871 Ide married Mary M. Melcher, daughter of Joseph and Sophia Melcher of Stoughton, Massachusetts. They had four children before her death in 1892: Adelaide (Addie) M., Annie L., Harry J. and Mary M.

During his time on Samoa, Ide became friends with Robert Louis Stevenson, who was heavily engaged in the politics of the region and a frequent commentator on Samoan affairs to the world at large. One day, Ide mentioned to Stevenson the feelings of his daughter Annie about having been born on Christmas Day and so having no birthday celebration separate from the family&#x27;s Christmas celebrations. Stevenson drew up a formal deed of gift, properly sealed and witnessed as a legal document, and then published in the press, donating his birthday to Ide&#x27;s daughter. The daughter and Stevenson corresponded further on the matter in November 1891, with Stevenson assuring her that &quot;I am sure [your father] will tell you this is sound law.&quot; The affair was the root of a strong bond between the Ide and Stevenson families.

Anne H. Ide, who was known as &quot;Levei-malo&quot; to the Samoans, married William Bourke Cockran in 1906, becoming his third wife. In 1912, his daughter Marjorie married Shane Leslie, a first cousin of Winston Churchill.

=== Death ===
Ide died in St. Johnsbury, Vermont on 13 June 1921. His body was buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in St. Johnsbury.

<text>The High Coast () is a part of the coast of Sweden on the Gulf of Bothnia, in the Ångermanland province of northeast Sweden, centered in the area of the municipalities of Kramfors, Härnösand and Örnsköldsvik. It is notable as an area for research on post-glacial rebound and eustacy, in which the land rises as the covering glaciers melt, a phenomenon first recognised and studied there. Since the last ice age, the land has risen 300 meters, which accounts for the region&#x27;s unusually tall cliffs. The High Coast is part of the Swedish/Finnish High Coast/Kvarken Archipelago UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its exceptional geology and unique example of isostatic rebound.

==Geology==
The relief of the High Coast is that of a large scale joint valley terrain that dissects uplifted remnants of the Sub-Cambrian peneplain. 

During the Ice Ages of the past 2-3 million years, the High Coast was repeatedly covered by continental ice sheet, including the Fennoscandian ice sheet until roughly 9600 years ago. When the glaciers retreated from the High Coast, the ground, which had been compacted by the weight of the ice sheet, went through rapid uplift, a process known as isostatic rebound. This rebound cause uplift of roughly 285 meters, the highest known isostatic rebound on Earth. The region is still rising, on the order of 8 mm per year. Remains of the former shorelines can be seen along the High Coast. 

Some of the fish species found in the High Coast are relict species from the most recent ice age, including the Fourhorn sculpin. Other animal species resident to the high coast include brown bears, lynx, and moose.

==History==
The area known today as &quot;Höga Kusten&quot; has historically been known as the &quot;Ångermanland Coast&quot;. In 1974, the term &quot;High Coast&quot; () was coined in connection with a report on the area.

In 2000, UNESCO put the area on the World Heritage List: &quot;The High Coast site affords outstanding opportunities for the understanding of the important processes that formed the glaciated and land uplift areas of the Earth&#x27;s surface.&quot; In 2006, the High Coast was joined with the Finnish Kvarken areas. The World Heritage Site ranges from the High Coast Bridge (Swedish: Högakustenbron) in the South to Skagsudde in the North. 

==Attractions==
The most popular places to visit in the High Coast of Sweden are Skule Mountain, Skuleskogen National Park, and the islands Ulvön and Trysunda.

The High Coast of Sweden is considered to be excellent for hiking and has been cited as one of the best hiking regions in Sweden.

Both outdoor magazines (such as Utemagasinet and Outside) and daily newspapers (such as Svenska Dagbladet) rank the High Coast Trail as one of the best of Sweden&#x27;s hiking trails.

The High Coast Trail is a 128-kilometer long trail along the High Coast. For day hikes, Skule Mountain and Skule National park are popular. The High Coast Hike (Höga Kusten Hike) is an annual event considered suitable for both experienced and new hikers.

The Höga Kusten Bridge is located in the region, while there are a number of picturesque islands and fishing villages in the area.

<text>William Brown Ide (March 28, 1796 – December 19 or 20, 1852) was an American pioneer who headed the short-lived California Republic in 1846.

==Life==
William Ide was born in Rutland, Massachusetts to Lemuel Ide, a member of the Vermont State Legislature. His first ancestor Nicholas Ide arrived to the Americas from England in 1636. A carpenter by trade, Ide married Susan Grout Haskell (1799–1850) in 1820. He and his wife Susan lived at first in Massachusetts, but soon began moving westward—to Kentucky, then to Ohio and finally to Illinois. They farmed in Springfield, where Ide supplemented his income by teaching school.

Since at least as early as 1886 and as late as 1993, some historians have argued that Ide was never a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This argument was settled in 2014 in the affirmative, however, when researchers Roger Robin Ekins, Michael N. Landon and Richard K. Behrens—building on the work of David Freeman and Ronald L. &quot;Smokey&quot; Bassett—positively identified an unsigned letter in the archives of the LDS Church as being penned by Ide. Ekins has laid out all of the arguments on both sides of this controversy, positively concluding that Ide was baptized a Mormon in July 1837, was likely set apart as the President of the Springville Branch of the Church in July 1844 and was called on a mission to assist Joseph Smith&#x27;s campaign for the Presidency of the United States on April 6, 1844. Accordingly, Ide and his family were the first known Mormons to enter California and Ide—as commander of the short-lived California Republic—was, arguably, the first LDS head of state.

In 1845, Ide sold his farm and joined a wagon train in Independence, Missouri headed for Oregon. On the advice of the mountain man Caleb Greenwood, Ide and a group of settlers split off and headed to Alta California, then a province of Mexico. They arrived at Sutter&#x27;s Fort on October 25, 1845. Ide traveled north to work for Peter Lassen on Rancho Bosquejo.

In 1846, on a report that the Mexican government was threatening to expel all settlers who were not Mexican citizens, about thirty settlers conducted what was to become known as the Bear Flag Revolt. On June 14, Ide and the others seized the pueblo of Sonoma and captured the Mexican Commandante of Northern California, Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, who in fact supported American annexation. On June 15, Ide released the Proclamation he had written the night before. By noon of June 17, the rebels raised the new California Bear Flag, proclaiming the Mexican province to be the California Republic. Ide had been chosen to serve as commander.

===Ide&#x27;s proclamation ===

William B. Ide wrote a proclamation announcing and explaining the reasons for the revolt during the night of June 14–15, 1846 (below). There were additional copies and some more moderate versions (produced in both English and Spanish) distributed around northern California through June 18.

The Bear Flag Republic lasted until July 9, 1846, just 25 days, until the U.S. Flag was raised at Sonoma. Ide and other &quot;Bear Flaggers&quot; joined John C. Frémont and the U.S. armed forces in taking possession of California from Mexico.

After the Mexican–American War, Ide returned to his home near Red Bluff, California, where he resumed his partnership with Josiah Belden at his Rancho Barranca Colorado. He bought out Belden in 1849, and was successful in mining. Ide went on to a distinguished career as a public servant in Colusi County (the precursor to portions of today&#x27;s Colusa, Glenn and Tehama Counties). There he served as Probate and County Judge, Presiding Judge of the Court of Sessions, County Recorder, County Auditor, County Clerk, County Treasurer, Deputy County Surveyor and Deputy Sheriff.

Ide died of smallpox in December 1852, probably during the night of the 19th–20th, at the age of 56. He is buried in a small cemetery on the east side of Highway 45, 5 miles south of Hamilton City at the former site of Monroeville where a monument is visible from the road. On June 7, 2014 new gravestones, created by William B. Ide Adobe State Historic Park docent David Freeman and assisted by members of the Chico California Stake of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, were dedicated by S. Dennis Holland, President of the California Pioneer Heritage Foundation &amp; Director of Public Affairs of LDS Historic Sites in California.

William B. Ide Adobe State Historic Park, comprising a restored adobe house and other buildings near Red Bluff, commemorates his life.

<doc id="738374" wikidata="Q2896236" url="?curid=738374" title="René Blum (impresario)">
<text>René Blum (13 March 1878 – September 1942) was a French Jewish theatrical impresario. He was the founder of the Ballet de l&#x27;Opéra at Monte Carlo and was the younger brother of the Socialist Prime Minister of France, Léon Blum. A Jew, he was interned in various camps from 1941 until he was murdered by the Nazis at the Auschwitz concentration camp in late September 1942. While at the camps, he was known for keeping up the spirits of his fellow prisoners with tales of his life in the arts.

==Biography==
Blum was born in Paris.

At the turn of the 20th century he was an editor at the Parisian literary journal &quot;Gil Blas&quot; and a popular theatre critic. He became a friend of Marcel Proust, and it was on his advice that Proust turned to Bernard Grasset to publish &quot;Du côté de chez Swann&quot;.

During World War I, Blum served in the Battle of the Somme. He saved threatened artwork from Amiens Cathedral and earned the French Croix de Guerre.

===Founder of Ballet of Monte-Carlo===
He became director of plays and operettas at Monte Carlo in 1924, where Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes was based. In 1931, Blum was hired by Louis II, Prince of Monaco, to create a ballet company that would continue the work and legacy of the late Diaghilev (who had died in 1929). In 1932, with the help of financier Serge Denham, Blum and Colonel W. de Basil formed the Ballets Russes de Monte-Carlo.

Blum and de Basil fell out in 1934, and their Ballets Russes partnership dissolved. Blum kept ballet alive in Monte Carlo. In short order, he hired choreographer Bronislava Nijinska. After Nijinska left, Blum hired Michel Fokine. In 1937, Blum and former Ballets Russes choreographer Léonide Massine acquired financing from Fleischmann&#x27;s Yeast heir Julius Fleischmann, Jr.&#x27;s World Art, Inc. to create a new ballet company. In 1938, their new company was allowed to regain the name &quot;Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo&quot; (although the company fled for the United States in 1939, and was thereafter mostly based in New York City).

===Deportation and death===
In the summer of 1940, after the German occupation of Paris, Blum returned to France to be with his family. He was arrested on 12 December 1941 in his Parisian home, among the first Jews to be arrested in Paris by the French police. He was held in the Beaune-la-Rolande internment camp, then in the Drancy internment camp. On 23 September 1942 he was shipped to the Auschwitz concentration camp. He was murdered by the Nazis at age 64 in late September 1942.

<doc id="738376" wikidata="Q438601" url="?curid=738376" title="Idris I of Morocco">
<text>Idris (I) ibn Abd Allah (; d. 791), also known as Idris the Elder (), was a Hasanid and the founder of the Idrisid dynasty in part of northern Morocco, after fleeing the Hejaz as a result of the Battle of Fakhkh. He ruled from 788 to 791. He is credited with founding the dynasty that established Moroccan statehood, and is regarded as the founding father of Morocco.

==History==
Idris was the great-grandchild of Hasan, who was the son of Fatima and Ali and grandson of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. He was born and raised in Arabia. His paternal half-brothers Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya and Ibrahim had been killed by the Abbasids during an abortive rebellion. His brother Yahya rose in revolt in Daylam, but was forced to surrender. He was persecuted by Caliph Harun al-Rashid thereafter, and repeatedly imprisoned.

Idris himself had participated (along with Yahya) in another Alid uprising in 786, under al-Husayn ibn Ali al-Abid. After the revolt&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Fakhkh, he escaped and remained in hiding, before moving to Egypt. Assisted by the local head of the caliphal postal system, Wadih, he managed to leave Egypt and reach the Maghreb.

In 789, he arrived in Tangier before going to Walīlī, the site of the Roman Volubilis. Here his headquarters have been discovered in recent excavations conducted by the Moroccan Institute of Archaeology (INSAP) and University College London. The headquarters lies just outside the walls of the Roman town, which was then occupied by the Berber tribe of the Awraba, under Ishaq ibn Muhammad. He married Kenza, of the Awraba, fathering a son, Idris II. This event is considered a consolidation and the birth of the Idrisid dynasty, the fourth Muslim State in Morocco after Nekor (710–1019), Barghawata (744–1058), and Midrar (757–976). 
Idris I conquered large parts of northern Morocco and founded the city of Fez. In 789 AD, he captured Tlemcen (in modern-day Algeria) from the Sufrite Ifranid Abu Qurra which became part of the kingdom. This succession of events prompted vengeance from the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid, who sent emissaries to kill him. Idris I died in 791 in Walīlī, allegedly poisoned by the caliph&#x27;s agents. His son, Idris II, was born a few months later and brought up by the Awraba under the regency of Rashid, his father&#x27;s freedman (&quot;mawla&quot;) and advisor. He left Walīlī for Fes in 808. During his reign (791–828) he successfully consolidated the Idrisid state and developed Fez into a thriving capital.

Idris I&#x27;s body was buried on a hill not far from Walīlī. The site of his tomb grew into a village known as Moulay Idriss Zerhoun. A &quot;zawiya&quot; (religious complex) centered around his mausoleum developed here over the centuries and remains an important religious site in Morocco today.

<text>A vascular headache is an outdated term to describe certain types of headache which were thought to be related to blood vessel swelling and hyperemia as cause of pain. 

There is no doubt that &quot;some&quot; headaches are caused by vascular effects. However, it is no longer a recognized term and not mentioned in the Headache classification of the International Headache society (IHS), although it is still used by some physicians and still mentioned in some medical classification systems. There are many types of vascular headaches. Other types of vascular headaches include headaches produced by fever, cluster headaches, and headaches from a rise in blood pressure (OSU Wexner Medical Center, 2012).
Headaches that were described as being vascular headaches include:
* Cluster headache
* Migraine
* Toxic headache

<text>Gargamelle was a heavy liquid bubble chamber detector in operation at CERN between 1970 and 1979. It was designed to detect neutrinos and antineutrinos, which were produced with a beam from the Proton Synchrotron (PS) between 1970 and 1976, before the detector was moved to the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). In 1979 an irreparable crack was discovered in the bubble chamber, and the detector was decommissioned. It is currently part of the &quot;Microcosm&quot; exhibition at CERN, open to the public.

Gargamelle is famous for being the experiment where neutral currents were discovered. Found in July 1973, neutral currents were the first experimental indication of the existence of the Z0 boson, and consequently a major step towards the verification of the electroweak theory.

Gargamelle can refer to both the bubble chamber detector itself, or the high-energy physics experiment by the same name. The name itself is derived from a 16th-century novel by François Rabelais, &quot;The Life of Gargantua and of Pantagruel&quot;, in which the giantess Gargamelle is the mother of Gargantua.

==Background==
In a series of separate works in the 1960s Sheldon Glashow, Steven Weinberg, and Abdus Salam came up with a theory that unified electromagnetic and weak interaction between elementary particles—the electroweak theory—for which they shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics. Their theory predicted the existence of the W± and Z0 bosons as propagators of the weak force. W± bosons have electric charge, either positive (W+) or negative (W−), the Z0, however, has no charge. Exchange of a Z0 boson transfers momentum, spin, and energy but leaves the particle&#x27;s quantum numbers unaffected—charge, flavor, baryon number, lepton number, etc. Since there is no transfer of electric charge, the exchange of a Z0 is referred to as &quot;neutral current&quot;. Neutral currents were a prediction of the electroweak theory.

In 1960 Melvin Schwartz proposed a method of producing an energetic neutrino beam. Such a beam was then used by Schwartz and others in an experiment in 1962 at Brookhaven which showed that there are different types of neutrinos: muon neutrinos and electron neutrinos. Schwartz shared the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery. Prior to Schwartz&#x27; idea weak interactions had been studied only in the decay of elementary particles, especially strange particles. Using these new neutrino beams greatly increased the energy available for the study of the weak interaction. Gargamelle was one of the first experiments that made use of a neutrino beam, produced with a proton beam from the PS.

A bubble chamber is simply a container filled with a superheated liquid. A charged particle travelling through the chamber will leave an ionization track, around which the liquid vaporizes, forming microscopic bubbles. The entire chamber is subject to a constant magnetic field, causing the tracks of the charged particles to curve. The radius of curvature is proportional to the momentum of the particle. The tracks are photographed, and by studying the tracks one can learn about the properties of the particles detected. The neutrino beam which travelled through the Gargamelle bubble chamber did not leave any tracks in the detector, since neutrinos have no charge. Interactions with neutrinos were therefore detected, by observing particles produced by the interactions of the neutrinos with the constituents of matter. Neutrinos have extremely small cross sections, i.e., the probability of interaction is very small. Whereas bubble chambers typically are filled with liquid hydrogen, Gargamelle was filled with a heavy liquid—CBrF3 (Freon)—increasing the probability of seeing neutrino interactions.

==Conception and construction==
The domain of neutrino physics was in rapid expansion in the 60&#x27;s. Neutrino experiments using bubble chambers were already running at the first synchrotron at CERN, the PS, and the question of the next generation of bubble chambers had been on the agenda for some time. André Lagarrigue, an esteemed physicist at the École Polytechnique in Paris, and some of his colleagues, wrote the first published report, dated 10 February 1964, proposing the construction of a heavy liquid chamber to be built under the supervision of CERN. He formed a collaboration consisting of seven laboratories: École Polytechnique Paris, RWTH Aachen, ULB Bruxelles, Istituto di Fisica dell&#x27;Università di Milano, LAL Orsay, University College London and CERN. The group met in Milan in 1968 to list the physics priorities for the experiment: today Gargamelle is famous for its discovery of the neutral currents, but while preparing the physics program the topic was not even discussed, and in the final proposal it is ranked as fifth in priority. At the time there was no consensus around the electroweak theory, which might explain the list of priorities. Also, earlier experiments looking for neutral currents in the decay of the neutral kaon into two charged leptons, had measured very small limits of around 10−7.

Due to budgetary crisis, the experiment was not approved in 1966, contrary to what was expected. Victor Weisskopf, Director General at CERN, and Bernard Grégory, Scientific Director, decided to commit the money themselves, the latter offering a loan to CERN to cover the instalment due for 1966. The final contract was signed on 2 December 1965, making this the first time in CERN&#x27;s history that an investment of this kind was not approved by the council, but by the Director General using his executive authority.

The Gargamelle chamber was entirely constructed at Saclay. Though the construction was delayed by about two years, it was finally assembled at CERN in December 1970, and the first important run occurred in March 1971.

==Experimental setup==
===The chamber===
Gargamelle was 4.8 meters long and 2 meters in diameter, and held 12 cubic meters of heavy liquid Freon. To bend the tracks of charged particles, Gargamelle was surrounded by a magnet providing a 2 Tesla field. The coils of the magnet were made of copper cooled down with water, and followed the oblong shape of Gargamelle. In order to maintain the liquid at an adequate temperature several water tubes surrounded the chamber body, to regulate the temperature. The entire installation weighed more than 1000 tons.

When recording an event, the chamber was illuminated and photographed. The illumination system emitted light that was scattered at 90° by the bubbles, and sent to the optics. The light source consisted of 21 point flashes disposed at the ends of the chamber body and over one half of the cylinder. The optics were situated in the opposite half of the cylinder, distributed in two rows parallel to the chamber axis, each rows having four optics. The objective was made by an assembly of lenses with a 90° angular field followed by a divergent lens which extends the field to 110°.

===The neutrino beam===
Gargamelle was designed for neutrino and antineutrino detection. The source of neutrinos and antineutrinos was a proton beam at an energy of 26 GeV from the PS. The protons were extracted by a magnet and then directed through an appropriate array of quadrupole and dipole magnets, providing the necessary degrees of freedom in position and orientation for adjusting the beam onto target. The target was a cylinder of beryllium, 90 cm long and 5 mm in diameter. The target material was chosen so that the hadrons produced in the collision was mainly pions and kaons, which both decay to neutrinos. The produced pions and kaons have a variety of angles and energies, and consequently their decay product will also have huge momentum spread. As neutrinos have no charge, they cannot be focused with electric or magnetic fields. Instead, one focuses the secondary particles by using a magnetic horn, invented by Nobel laurate Simon van der Meer. The shape of the horn and the strength of the magnetic field can be tuned to select a range of particles that are to be best focused, resulting in a focused neutrino beam with a chosen range of energy as the kaons and pions decay. By reversing the current through the horn, one could produce an antineutrino beam. Gargamelle ran alternately in a neutrino and an antineutrino beam. The invention of van der Meer increased the neutrino flux by a factor of 20. The neutrino beam had an energy between 1 and 10 GeV.

After being focused, the pions and kaons were directed through a 70 m long tunnel, allowing them to decay. Pions and kaons that did not decay hit a shielding in the end of the tunnel and were absorbed. When decaying, pions and kaons normally decay in and , meaning that the flux of neutrinos would be proportional to the flux of muons. As the muons were not absorbed as hadrons, the flux of charged muons was stopped by an electromagnetic slowing down process in the long shielding. The neutrino flux was measured through the corresponding muon flux by means of six planes of silicium-gold detectors placed at various depths in shielding.

During the years 1971-1976 large improvements factors were obtained in the intensity, first with a new injector for the PS — the Proton Synchrotron Booster — and secondly by the careful study of beam optics.

==Results and discoveries==
The first main quest of Gargamelle was to search for evidence of hard-scattering of muon-neutrinos and antineutrinos off nucleons. The priorities changed in March 1972, when the first hints of the existence of hadronic neutral current became obvious. It was then decided to make a two-prong attack in the search for neutral current candidates. One line would search for leptonic events — events involving the interaction with an electron in the liquid, e.g. or . The other line would search for hadronic events — involving a neutrino scattered from a hadron, e.g. , or , plus events with many hadrons. The leptonic events have small cross-sections, but correspondingly small background. The hadronic events have larger backgrounds, most extensively due to neutrons produced when neutrinos interact in the material around the chamber. Neutrons, being of no charge, would not be detected in the bubble chamber, and the detection of their interactions would mimic neutral currents events. In order to reduce the neutron background, the energy of the hadronic events had to be greater than 1 GeV.

The first example of a leptonic event was found in December 1972 at Gargamelle by a graduate student from Aachen. By March 1973 166 hadronic events had been found, 102 events with the neutrino beam and 64 events with the antineutrino beam. However, the question of neutron background hung over the interpretation of the hadronic events. The problem was solved by studying the charged current events which also had an associated neutron interaction which satisfied the hadronic event selection. In this way one has a monitor of the neutron background flux. On the 19th of July 1973 the Gargamelle collaboration presented the discovery of neutral currents at a seminar at CERN.

The Gargamelle collaboration discovered both leptonic neutral currents — events involving the interaction of a neutrino with an electron — and hadronic neutral currents — events when a neutrino is scattered from a nucleon. The discovery was very important as it was in support of the electroweak theory, today a pillar of the Standard Model. The final experimental proof the electroweak theory came in 1983, when the UA1 and UA2 collaboration discovered the W± and Z0 bosons.

Initially the first priority of the Gargamelle had been to measure the neutrino and antineutrino cross-sections and structure functions. The reason for this was to test the quark model of the nucleon. Firstly the neutrino and antineutrino cross-sections were shown to be linear with energy, which is what one expects for the scattering of point-like constituents in the nucleon. Combining the neutrino and antineutrino structure functions allowed the net number of quarks in the nucleon to be determined, and this was in good agreement with 3. In addition comparing the neutrino results with results from Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in the US, using an electron beam, one found that quarks had fractional charges, and experimentally proved the values of these charges: + e, − e. The results were published in 1975, providing crucial evidence for the existence of quarks.

<text>Paul Robert Ignatius (born November 11, 1920) is an American government official who served as Secretary of the Navy between 1967 and 1969 and was the Assistant Secretary of Defense during the Lyndon Johnson Administration. He is currently the oldest-living former U.S. government official.

==Life and career==

Ignatius was born in 1920 in Glendale, California, the son of Armenian parents who migrated to the United States, Elisa (née Jamgochian; ) and Hovsep &quot;Joseph&quot; B. Ignatius (original last name – Ignatosian; ). Ignatius&#x27; ancestors came from the historic Armenian settlement of Agin near Kharpert. Ignatius is a trustee of the George C. Marshall Foundation and member of the Federal City Council and the Washington Institute of Foreign Affairs. He has served previously as cofounder and chairman of the board of trustees for Logistics Management Institute; chairman, president and CEO of Air Transport Association; president of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; newspaper and executive vice president of The Washington Post Company; Secretary of the Navy; Assistant Secretary of Defense (Installations and Logistics), Under Secretary of the Army, and Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations and Logistics).

While serving as Secretary of the Navy, he presented the Congressional Medal of Honor to Captain William Loren McGonagle for the heroism he demonstrated during the 1967 USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident. McGonagle&#x27;s Medal of Honor was not presented to him by the President of the United States in a public ceremony at the White House, as is customary, but was instead presented at the Washington Navy Yard. This is the only time in history it has been done this way. At the time of the ceremony, President Lyndon B. Johnson was in the East Room of the White House overseeing the graduation of high school students from Capitol Page School. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, a longtime &quot;Liberty&quot; advocate, was also in attendance. Moorer explained the award was presented in this manner because the attack on the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; had been covered-up by the incumbent presidential administration.

He founded Harbridge House, Inc., a Boston management consulting and research firm. Ignatius received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Southern California (Phi Beta Kappa and Phi Kappa Tau) and his MBA degree from Harvard Business School. He served as a commissioned lieutenant in the U.S. Navy in World War II, principally as an aviation ordnance officer aboard escort aircraft carrier in the Pacific. He has two sons and two daughters. David Ignatius is a columnist for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and a novelist. Adi Ignatius is editor-in-chief of &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot;. Both daughters, Sarah and Amy, have practiced law. Amy Ignatius is a Superior Court Judge in New Hampshire. Sarah Ignatius has worked for decades as a non-profit executive director.

==Personal life==
He married Nancy Weiser Sharpless (1925–2019) in 1947. They had four children, including David and Adi. He turned 100 on November 11, 2020. He currently lives in Washington D.C.

==Legacy==
On May 23, 2013, the Navy announced that an , would be named for him. It was commissioned at Port Everglades, Florida on July 27, 2019.

<text>Nils Claus Ihlen (24 July 1855 – 22 March 1925) was a Norwegian engineer and politician for the Liberal Party. He served as Foreign Minister of Norway from 1913 to 1920.

==Early life==
He was born in Skedsmo as the oldest son of Wincentz Thurmann Ihlen (1826–1892) and Birgitte Elisabeth Mørch (1830–1913). He was a first cousin of Christian Ihlen, nephew of Niels Ihlen and of Jacob Thurmann Ihlen, great-grandson of the constitutional founding father Ole Clausen Mørch and brother-in-law of Per Lund.

In August 1892, he was married to actress Constance Bruun, but she died in October 1894. In February 1898, he married a colonel&#x27;s daughter, Henriette Marie Lund (1870–1962). The couple had several daughters and sons. The sons Nils, Joakim and Alf (Nils was the half-brother of the other two) took over the family business.

Ihlen took his education at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule of Zürich and returned to Norway in 1877 to work one year for the Norwegian State Railways. In 1878 he was hired by his father at the iron works Strømmens Værksted (then named &quot;W. Ihlen, Strømmen&quot;) to work as a manager. In 1883, he took over as owner of the factory. He left in 1908 and left his younger brothers in control.

==Political career==
Ihlen first entered politics as mayor of Skedsmo Municipality and served from 1989 to 1904 and 1907 to 1910. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway in 1907 and represented the rural constituency of &quot;Mellem Romerike&quot;.

After one year l, he was appointed Minister of Labour in the first cabinet Knudsen. During his tenure, there were several achievements, including the opening of the Rjukan Line and the Bergen Line railways. His seat in Parliament was taken by Martin Løken in 1908 and 1909, and Ihlen was not re-elected in 1910. The first cabinet Knudsen fell in February 1910, but when the second cabinet Knudsen assumed office on 31 January 1913, Ihlen was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs. He served through the entire World War I during which Norway balanced on a thin line of neutrality. For some days in July 1918, he had also served as Minister of Industrial Provisioning. In June 1920, Ihlen resigned along with the rest of the second cabinet Knudsen and then left national politics.

Ihlen died in 1925 in Kristiania.

==Ihlen Declaration==

The Ihlen Declaration was a statement made on 22 July 1919 by the Nils Claus on the topic of Denmark&#x27;s sovereignty over Greenland in which Ihlen declared verbally to the Danish minister that &quot;the plans of the Royal [Danish] Government respecting Danish sovereignty over the whole of Greenland... would be met with no difficulties on the part of Norway&quot;. The declaration became an issue when the question was raised whether the statement was binding on Norway. The question eventually went all the way to the Permanent Court of International Justice in the form of the Eastern Greenland Case in 1933.

<text>Ilya Arnoldovich Ilf (born Iehiel-Leyb Aryevich Faynzilberg; ; – 13 April 1937) was a Soviet journalist and writer of Jewish origin who usually worked in collaboration with Yevgeny Petrov during the 1920s and 1930s. Their duo was known simply as Ilf and Petrov. Together they published two popular comedy novels &quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot; (1928) and &quot;The Little Golden Calf&quot; (1931), as well as a satirical book &quot;Odnoetazhnaya Amerika&quot; (often translated as &quot;Little Golden America&quot;) that documented their journey through the United States between 1935 and 1936.

==Biography==

Iliya Ilf (born Faynzilberg) was born on October 15, 1897, in Odessa, he was the third of four sons of Ariye Benjamin Faynzilberg and his wife Mindle Aronovna Faynzilberg (née Kotlova). The family moved from Boguslav to Odessa before Ilf&#x27;s birth. His father was a Jewish bank clerk. He graduated from a technical school in 1913 and held various positions, including time at the telephone company and a military plant. After the Russian Revolution, he began working as a journalist, editing several humor magazines, and joined the Odessa Union of Poets.

In 1923, he relocated to Moscow and took employment at the newspaper &#x27; (roughly &quot;Toot!&quot;, meaning the locomotive horn noise), a publication for railway workers. His contributions consisted mostly of satirical pieces. It was there that he met his writing partner, Petrov. In 1928, they were both let go, due to staff reductions, but they were able to find work at &#x27;, a literary journal that provided a start for many Soviet writers and artists. From 1932 to 1937, they also wrote pieces for major publications such as &quot;Pravda&quot;, &quot;Literaturnaya Gazeta&quot; and &quot;Krokodil&quot;. Ilf also had a passion for photography, but this was not fully appreciated until years after his death, when his daughter discovered his photograph albums.

== Illness and death ==
Ilf had been diagnosed with tuberculosis in the 1920s. He thought it was in remission, but he was diagnosed with it again during his trip to America, and he died not long after returning. Days later, a Nazi propaganda newspaper, &quot;Der Angriff&quot;, published an article claiming that Ilf committed suicide following a scathing critique from the Soviet government during a writers&#x27; convention. Petrov immediately published a denial in &quot;Pravda&quot; called &quot;An Answer to Fascist Slanderers&quot;, pointing out that his death was caused by illness and that nothing extraordinary happened during the convention, with a full transcript of the proceedings. However, the suicide version is still used by some Western biographers.

==Personal life==
In 1921, in Odessa, Ilf met the love of his life, Maria Nikolayevna Tarasenko (1904–1981). They married in Moscow in 1924, and had a daughter Aleksandra born in 1935.

Ilf was a passionate photographer. In 1929, Yevgeni Petrov lent him 800 rubles for a camera, and then jokingly regretted that he had lost not only his money but also a friend and co-writer, as Ilf stopped writing and spent most of his time on photography. Long after Ilf&#x27;s death, his daughter had found and published ca. 200 of his photographs.

<text>The Indian Museum (formerly called Imperial Museum of Calcutta before independence,) is a massive museum in Central Kolkata, West Bengal, India. It is the ninth oldest museum in the world and the oldest and largest museum in Asia, by size of collection. It has rare collections of antiques, armour and ornaments, fossils, skeletons, mummies and Mughal paintings. It was founded by the Asiatic Society of Bengal in Kolkata (Calcutta), India, in 1814. The founder curator was Nathaniel Wallich, a Danish botanist.

It has six sections comprising thirty five galleries of cultural and scientific artifacts namely Indian art, archaeology, anthropology, geology, zoology and economic botany. Many rare and unique specimens, both Indian and trans-Indian, relating to humanities and natural sciences, are preserved and displayed in the galleries of these sections. In particular the art and archaeology sections hold collections of international importance.

It is an autonomous organization under the Ministry of Culture, Government of India. The present Director of the Indian Museum is Shri Arijit Dutta Choudhury who is also the Director General, NCSM and having the additional charge of Director General of National Library.

==History==
The Indian Museum originated from the Asiatic Society of Bengal which was created by Sir William Jones in 1784. The concept of having a museum arose in 1796 from members of the Asiatic Society as a place where man-made and natural objects collected could be kept, cared for and displayed.

The objective began to look achievable in 1808 when the Society was offered suitable accommodation by the Government of India in the Chowringhee-Park Street area.

On 2 February 1814, Nathaniel Wallich, a Danish botanist, who had been captured in the siege of Serampore but later released, wrote to the council of the Asiatic Society for the formation of a museum out of his own collection and that of the Asiatic Society in Calcutta, volunteering his service as a Curator wherein he proposed five sections—an archaeological, ethnological, a technical section and a geological and zoological one. The council readily agreed and the Museum was created, with Wallich named the Honorary Curator and then Superintendent of the Oriental Museum of the Asiatic Society. Wallich also donated a number of botanical specimens to the museum from his personal collection. In 1815, Mr William Lloyd Gibbons, Asst Secretary and Librarian, was appointed Joint Secretary of the Museum.
After the resignation of Wallich, curators were paid salaries by the Asiatic Society ranging from Rs 50 to Rs 200 a month. However, in 1836, when the bankers of the Asiatic Society (Palmer and Company) became insolvent, the Government began to pay the salary of the Curator from its public funds since a large part of the collection was that of the surveyors of Survey of India.

A temporary grant of Rs 200 per month was sanctioned for maintenance of the museum and library, and J. T. Pearson of the Bengal Medical Service was appointed curator, followed shortly by John McClelland and, after the former&#x27;s resignation, by Edward Blyth.

In 1840, the Government took a keen interest in geology and mineral resources, and this led to an additional grant of Rs 250 per month for the geological section alone. In 1851 when the Geological Survey of India came into being with the advent of Sir Thomas Oldham, a rented building at 1, Hastings Road now K N Roy Road, the present site of the New Secretariat became its office. The geological collection of the Government of India &#x27;Museum of Economic Geology&#x27; at the Asiatic Society, were then transferred to this site in 1856. The Asiatic Society geological collection were however held back with the condition that it would be handed over to the GSI once a Museum for all its collection came into being. It was way back in 1837 that Sir James Princeps, then-Secretary of the Asiatic Society, had written to the Government asking for a Museum paid for by the state. A movement for a full-fledged Museum was thereafter keenly pursued over a decade, and later, with Sir Thomas Oldham, then Superintendent of the Geological Survey of India, at the helm, it gained momentum.
The thrust for a full-fledged Museum was held up due to the intervention of the revolt of the sepoys of the East India Company. The matter was pursued again, once things settled down after India came under the Crown.

Thereafter the First Indian Museum Act was passed in 1866 and the foundation of the Indian Museum at its present site laid in 1867. In 1875 the present building on Chowringee Road, presently Jawaharlal Nehru Road, designed by W L Granville in consultation with Sir Thomas Holland, on Chowringee was completed. In 1877 after the retirement of Sir Thomas Oldham in 1876 the Geological Survey of India including the Museum of Economic Geology shifted here from its rented accommodation on 1 Hastings Road.
This building had been designated as the site for not just the Asiatic Societies, Oriental Museum&#x27;s collection and the Economic Geology collection of the Geological Survey of India but also to hold the offices of both.

The Asiatic Society however relinquished its rights preferring to maintain its autonomy from the government. The Geological Survey of India is till date headquartered at the buildings of the Indian Museum Complex and holds exclusive rights over the Geological galleries of the Indian Museum.

The building parallel to Sudder Street commenced in 1888 and occupied in 1891. The next building block at right angle to Sudder Street was erected in 1894. Half of this building was consigned to the Geological Survey of India but by 1912 it was wholly transferred to it.
The Zoological and Anthropological sections of the museum gave rise to the Zoological Survey of India in 1916, which in turn gave rise to the Anthropological Survey of India in 1945.

The Scottish anatomist and zoologist John Anderson took up the position of curator in 1865, and catalogued the mammal and archaeology collections. The English zoologist James Wood-Mason worked at the museum from 1869 and succeeded Anderson as curator in 1887.

The museum was closed to visitors for restoration and upgrades from September 2013 to February 2014.

==Collections==
=== Egyptian ===
It currently occupies a resplendent mansion, and exhibits among others: an Egyptian mummy. The mummy is being restored.

=== Indian ===
The large collection of ancient and medieval Indian artifacts include the complete railings and gateways of the Buddhist stupa from Bharhut (the bare stupa is still at Bharhut, near Satna, MP). The Bharhut panels are unique in that they are inscribed in the Brahmi script. The museum has a collection of the remains of the slightly later Amaravati Stupa. There is a large and representative collection of Buddhist and Hindu sculptures of the medieval period, especially those from Bengal, Bihar, and Odisha.

Also preserved are Buddha&#x27;s relics, a copy of the Lion Capital of Ashoka from an Ashoka pillar (original in the Sarnath Museum) whose four-lion symbol became the official emblem of the Republic of India, fossil skeletons of prehistoric animals, an art collection, rare antiques, and a collection of meteorites.

The Indian Museum is also regarded as &quot;the beginning of a significant epoch initiating the socio-cultural and scientific achievements of the country. It is otherwise considered as the beginning of the modernity and the end of medieval era&quot;.

=== Natural History ===
The museum has four galleries dedicated to natural history, namely the botanical, insect, mammal and bird galleries. It also contains prehistoric artifacts such as the huge skeleton of a dinosaur.

==Administration==
Administrative control of the Cultural sections, viz. Art, Archaeology and Anthropology rests with the Board of Trustees under its Directorate, and that of the three other science sections is with the geological survey of India, the zoological survey of India and the Botanical survey of India. The museum Directorate has eight co-ordinating service units: Education, preservation, publication, presentation, photography, medical, modelling and library. This multipurpose institution with multidisciplinary activities is being included as an Institute of national importance in the seventh schedule of the Constitution of India.

<text>The West Rail line () was a commuter rail / rapid transit line that formed part of the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system in Hong Kong until 27 June 2021. Coloured magenta on the MTR map, the line ran from Tuen Mun to Hung Hom, with a total length of , in 37 minutes. The railway connected the urban area of Kowloon and the new towns of Yuen Long, Tin Shui Wai and Tuen Mun in the northwestern New Territories.

The line was the second of three lines built and operated by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC), then known as the KCR West Rail (). It was designed to suburban rail standards similar to that of KCR&#x27;s first line, now the East Rail line, anticipating freight and intercity services to Mainland China, although the latter role was ultimately superseded by the Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link Hong Kong section as part of the China Railway High-speed network.

After KCRC&#x27;s merger of operations with the MTR Corporation on 2 December 2007, the West Rail line was operated as part of the MTR network. Along with the Ma On Shan line, the line was integrated into the Tuen Ma line in June 2021 upon the completion of Phase 1 of the Sha Tin to Central Link.

== History ==
=== Planning ===
A railway to the northwestern New Territories from the urban area in Kowloon was recommended as early as 1978 in a Tuen Mun Transport Study by Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick &amp; Partner; by the early 1990s, the surge of commuter towns in Yuen Long and Tuen Mun had frequently brought road networks to a standstill, as urban populations spilled over to the bedroom communities while keeping their jobs in Kowloon and Hong Kong Island.

The 1994 Hong Kong Government Railway Development Strategy report envisaged a domestic passenger service between the Northwestern New Territories (NWNT) and urban Kowloon, a cross-boundary passenger service for passengers travelling between Hong Kong and Mainland China, and container freight transport between ports in Mainland China and Hong Kong.

In January 1995, the Government invited the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC) to submit a proposal for the design, construction and operation of the proposed Western Corridor Railway. KCRC submitted a full proposal in November 1995, as did MTRC; twelve months later, the Government adopted KCRC&#x27;s proposal. Tuen Mun residents clamoured for a direct connection (or failing that, a costly alternative coastal alignment), and the terminus was duly extended along Tuen Mun Nullah. Along with the Light Rail network, which was reconfigured as a feeder system, the new railway was designed to serve 1.08 million residents in northwestern New Territories, 25% of whom lived within walking distance to stations compared to 80% along the Tseung Kwan O line.p. 39

In August 1996, the KCR Corporation set up the West Rail Steering Committee to oversee all aspects of the project. Originally conceived and carried through to the technical design phase as a 12-car system, paralleling the KCRC-operated East Rail line, the West Rail project was re-evaluated by the KCRC in autumn of 1998; the present nine-car capacity (of which trains of eight-cars are currently run) is a result of improved ultimate headway from 120 seconds to 90.

The first phase of construction included a double-track commuter railway connecting Tuen Mun station and Nam Cheong station in newly reclaimed West Kowloon, at a cost of HK$46.4 billion in 2002 prices which was some 28% lower than the original estimate in 1998; later reports cite $51.7 billion in money of the day prices.

=== Initial operation ===
Originally, the KCRC expected the West Rail to have a daily ridership of about 340,000 upon commissioning and 500,000 by 2011. Actual figures hovered around 100,000 by April 2004, however, and rose to 170,000 by the end of the year following a series of discounts. Frequent breakdowns (by local standards: 24 incidents in 2004 caused a delay of eight minutes or more) led KCRC Chairman Michael Tien to announce that he would consider resigning if service performance failed to improve.

Some 30,000 flats were originally planned to be built along the route between 2006 and 2011, only to be put on hold when the property market crashed. The commuter line was built after the new towns in north-west New Territories, along with road-based transport networks, were nearing completion. Attempts to boost patronage were made by cutting longstanding bus services, which in turn necessitated government compensation to private bus operator Kowloon Motor Bus.

===Kowloon Southern Link===
On 16 August 2009, the Kowloon Southern Link from Nam Cheong to East Tsim Sha Tsui station was opened. At the same time, the existing segment between East Tsim Sha Tsui station and Hung Hom station was transferred from the East Rail line to the West Rail line, and both services now terminated in the south and interchanged at Hung Hom.

== Route ==

Like all MTR lines, the West Rail line is grade-separated throughout its entire length and includes a combination of underground, at-grade, and elevated sections. Running from southeast to northwest, it starts at Hung Hom station at ground level and initially heads southwest into a tunnel and descending underground through East Tsim Sha Tsui and Austin stations (the former having originally being served by the East Rail line, and the track heading northwards through the latter), before returning to ground level (though still fully covered) at Nam Cheong station. The track then runs northwest through a sealed box tunnel just to the north to and under the West Kowloon Highway through Lai Chi Kok Park into Mei Foo station, which has a ground-level/underground hybrid design. Bored tunnels traverse densely populated Kwai Chung and under the Tsuen Wan line towards Tsuen Wan West station on reclaimed land, after which a bored rock tunnel, the Tai Lam Tunnel, takes trains through Tai Lam Country Park.

The line emerges into open air just south of the train depot at Pat Heung and initially runs at-grade, and later on an embankment, as it approaches Kam Sheung Road station. The rest of the line is fully elevated and constructed on a continuous viaduct, running in a westerly direction through the new towns of Yuen Long and turning towards the south at Tin Shui Wai, before taking a bend towards the Tuen Mun River and eventually terminating at Tuen Mun station.

== Capacity and ridership ==

=== Rolling stock and technology ===
The West Rail line was served by 33 eight-car MTR SP1900 EMUs built by a Japanese consortium of Kinki Sharyo and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, of which 22 were originally ordered by KCRC as seven-car trains for the initial opening of the line (the same model was ordered in 12-car and 4-car variants for the East Rail and the original Ma On Shan line, respectively). Up to 26 sets run during the morning peak service with a 171-second headway; MTRC specifies capacities of 52 seated and 286 standing passengers per car. 

In March 2020, a newly built eight-car East West line train, manufactured by CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles, entered service on the line. Similar to the previous rolling stock, the trains had a maximum running speed of and travel at an average speed of on the West Rail line. Unlike the trains on the East Rail line, there are no first-class compartments. All trains are serviced at Pat Heung depot and are equipped with the SelTrac IS moving block signalling system for train protection; this was among the earliest applications of the technology on a high-capacity, heavy-rail line worldwide.

Beginning in January 2016, all 7-car trains were converted to 8-car trains in anticipation of the Sha Tin to Central Link (see ); this was completed in May 2018. During the transition period with both 7-car and 8-car trains in service, passengers had to pay attention to the platform LCD screens and announcements to queue at the right part of the platforms.

=== Theoretical capacity ===
The line increased capacity between the northwest New Territories and urban areas by about 80%, and on the Tuen Mun-Yuen Long Corridor by about 200%. Crowding on trains–or a lack thereof–has been a matter of heated public debate since its inauguration, as the government has no specific indicator for measuring
crowdedness in train compartments as of 2014.

Japanese train manufacturer Kinki Sharyo quoted car capacities (standing plus seating) upward of 430 for cab cars and 452 for the rest. KCRC&#x27;s stress tests prior to the system&#x27;s début specified a crush-load capacity of 2345, or 335 passengers in longitudinal seating for each of its seven cars, which corresponds to seven passengers per square metre in line with MTRC standards. This contrasts with a worst-case allowable planning standard of 5 pax/square metre in the United States.

In industry journals, KCRC engineers and academics quoted ultimate limits upwards of 100,000 under 105-second headways, in nine-car configuration; however, both post-merger MTRC and government planning consultants report that the &#x27;designed maximum one-hour carrying capacity&#x27; is actually 64,000, a figure described in Hansard footnotes as &#x27;calculated in terms of the highest train frequency allowed with the existing signaling system&#x27;; in the consultants&#x27; report, 2011 average loading from Kam Sheung Road to Tsuen Wan West during the busiest morning peak hour stood at 65% (of the &quot;one-direction passenger capacity of the trains operated along the railway line&quot;, the exact figure of which was unspecified): consultants thus referred to &quot;under-utilisation of train capacity&quot;3.11. (The same consultant also forecast 50,000 pax/hr in 2031, given a peak service of 28 tph at 75,000 pax/hr capacity.)

=== Actual ridership ===
In present operations, parliamentary briefs state that the Kowloon Southern Link raised the one-hour carrying capacity from 39,900 to 46,900 pax/hr when headway was shortened from 3.5 minutes to 3.

2013 LegCo submissions from the MTRC confirmed that the capacity was at 46,900 pax/hr, with average train loading during morning peak hours on weekdays (from 6.30am to 9am) at around 70%. Extrapolated, 4.5 pax/square metre would translate to &#x27;maximal overcrowding&#x27; by London Underground authorities&#x27; definitions; however, James Blake, then Senior Director/Capital Projects of KCRC, noted that 6 pax/square metre was used in demand-capacity projections at peak times, and &quot;this figure would be quite acceptable to the ordinary travelling public even at peak times&quot;p. 11.

In December 2013, the Transport and Housing Bureau submitted detailed definitions to legislators regarding average train loading without specifying the figures: they were eventually released in February 2014 in a Legco subcommittee submission. It recognised that 6 pax/square metre design capacity standards were not achieved in actual operations, and that the service level of new MTR lines is pitched at 4 pax/square metre service benchmark. At 4 pax/square metre, the critical link on the line ran at 99% capacity (34,600 pax/hr) in 2013, partly due to lengthy turnaround times at the present Hung Hom terminus which depressed realizable carrying capacity by 20%.

Platform screen doors

All West Rail line stations have platform screen doors. The only exception was Hung Hom station, which shared its platform with the East Rail line until it was moved underground on 20 June 2021.

== Fare system ==
The fare system of the line generally followed the other lines on the former KCR network. Octopus cards and single ride tickets were available. All persons aged between 12 and 64 were charged the adult fare, whereas children aged 11 or below, full-time students, and seniors aged 65 or above were entitled to a concession fare.

As with the contemporaneous East Tsim Sha Tsui extension, the KCRC adopted a &quot;value of time&quot; methodology when fare levels were established for new services, resulting in a significant markup compared to bus and East Rail services.

Like the East Rail, Tuen Ma, and Tung Chung lines, the West Rail line also offered day passes and monthly passes.
;Monthly passes
:&quot;Tuen Mun-Hung Hom Monthly Pass&quot; and &quot;Tuen Mun-Nam Cheong Monthly Pass&quot; are Octopus-stored monthly unlimited passes between the said stations, Light Rail, MTR Bus, and designated minibus routes. They were priced at HK$490 and $420 respectively unless passengers hold valid discounted passes ($410/$330), in which case the discount is rolled on. Connections to the rest of the MTR network are charged to the Octopus as if the journey were made from/to the cheapest of the interchanging West Rail line station.

;Day passes
:&quot;Tuen Mun-Nam Cheong Day Pass&quot; is a $28 electronic/paper ticket combo between the said stations, MTR Bus and Light Rail; other onward connections must be made separately by exiting and re-entering the station.

:A sightseeing bus service was run as a temporary feeder service of the West Rail line in the northwest New Territories. This service was launched on 26 September 2004 and ended on 28 November.

== Stations ==

The following is a list of the stations on the West Rail line, all of which have now been transferred to the Tuen Ma line.

=== Notes ===

== Major incidents ==

=== Train explosion ===
At 9:15am on 14 February 2007, a passenger train broke down when one of the voltage transformers mounted on the train roof exploded. This incident occurred in the southbound direction in the tunnel between Kam Sheung Road and Tsuen Wan West, about north of Tsuen Wan West. Around 650 passengers had to evacuate through the dark tunnel to the station, while around 340 people returned to the ground through a ventilation shaft at Chai Wan Kok. Eleven people were sent to hospital. Train services returned to normal after 4 hours.

It was suspected that the overheated transformer caused its insulating oil to vaporise, thus causing the explosion. The train-borne circuit breaker, which was connected in parallel to the voltage transformer to the train pantograph, was not designed to isolate this kind of fault. After the incident, all SP1900 EMUs had their voltage transformers replaced. The new voltage transformers are German-made dry type transformers, which will not catch fire, even if they fail.

As an apology, the West Rail was opened for free rides on 21 February 2007, the first working day after the Chinese New Year holiday.

===Yuen Long attack===

On the night of 21 July 2019, during ongoing protests in the territory, Yuen Long station was stormed by armed men, and 45 people were injured.

== Future development ==
Current proposals tabled under the Railway Development Strategy 2014 plan by the Hong Kong Government include the Northern Link, a spur line from Kam Sheung Road station to Lok Ma Chau station and a future Kwu Tung station, both on the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line of the East Rail line; and two new stations on the current West Rail line route in Hung Shui Kiu and Tuen Mun South. Hung Shui Kiu may house 160,000 in a new town, whereas Tuen Mun South is already home to 90,000 residents.

<text>Naftali Herz Imber (, ; December 27, 1856 – October 8, 1909) was a Jewish Hebrew-language poet, most notable for writing &quot;Hatikvah&quot;, the poem that became the basis for the Israeli national anthem.

==Biography==
Naftali Herz Imber was born in Złoczów (now Zolochiv, Ukraine), a city in Galicia, which then was part of the Austrian Empire. His parents were Joshua Heschel Schorr and Hodel Imber, who followed a strictly Orthodox lifestyle. He began writing poetry at the age of 10 and several years later received an award from Emperor Franz Joseph for a poem on the centenary of Bukovina&#x27;s joining to the Austrian Empire. His brother, Shmaryahu Imber, also became a writer and a local teacher, and his son, Naftali&#x27;s nephew Shmuel Yankev, became a Yiddish language poet. In his youth Naftali Herz Imber traveled through Hungary, Serbia, and Romania.

In 1882 Imber moved to Ottoman Palestine as a secretary of Sir Laurence Oliphant. He lived with Oliphant and his wife Alice in their homes in Haifa and Daliyat al-Karmel. Oliphant sent him to Beirut to learn the art of watchmaking. Upon his return he helped Imber open a shop in Haifa.In 1884, he moved to Jerusalem, where he wrote poems suffused with elation and hope. In 1889, after quarreling with Oliphant, Imber departed for England. From there he traveled to Paris, Berlin and Bombay. In 1892, he headed for the United States, traveling from one city to another.

In Chicago he met a Protestant physician, Amanda Katie, who converted to Judaism and married him. Israel Zangwill described her as &quot;a Christian crank.&quot; The brief marriage ended in divorce. The eminent Jewish judge, Mayer Sulzberger, became his benefactor, providing him with a monthly allowance that allowed him to survive.

==Literary career==
In 1882, he published his first book of poems, &quot;Morning Star&quot; ( &quot;Barkai&quot;), in Jerusalem. One of the book&#x27;s poems was &quot;Tikvateinu&quot; (&quot;Our Hope&quot;); its very first version was written already in 1877 in Iaşi, Romania. This poem soon became the lyrics of the Zionist anthem and later the Israeli national anthem Hatikvah.

Imber has been described as the &quot;first Hebrew beatnik.&quot; He made a mockery of the serious and had a sardonic vulgar wit. Apart from writing his own poems, Imber also translated Omar Khayyam into Hebrew. Additionally, he published Treasures of Two Worlds: Unpublished Legends and Traditions of the Jewish Nation (1910), which posited that the Tabernacle carried by the Hebrews during their 40 years in the desert contained an electrical generator, and that King Solomon invented the telephone.

Imber died penniless in New York City on October 8, 1909 from the effects of chronic alcoholism, nonetheless beloved by the local Jewish community. He had made prior arrangement for his burial by selling a poem, but with his immediate family living in Europe and unavailable to make his funeral arrangements, there was controversy about the cemetery in which he was to be buried. He was buried in Mount Zion Cemetery in Queens, In 1953, he was re-interred at Har HaMenuchot, in Jerusalem.

<text>Inayatullah Khan (Pashto/Persian: ), (20 October 1888 – 12 August 1946) was the King of Afghanistan for three days in January 1929. He was the son of former Afghan Emir, Habibullah Khan. Inayatullah&#x27;s brief reign ended with his abdication.

Khan was born into a Pashtun family. In the middle of the night, on 14 January 1929, Amanullah Khan handed over his throne to his brother Inayatullah Khan and tried to secretly escape from Kabul to Kandahar. Habibullāh Kalakāni and his followers chased Amanullah&#x27;s Rolls-Royce on horseback but Amanullah managed to escape.

With the King gone, Kalakani wrote a letter to Inayatullah to either surrender or prepare for war. Inayatullah&#x27;s response was that he had never sought nor wished to be king and agreed to abdicate and proclaim Kalakani as king on 17 January 1929. Inayatullah was airlifted out of Kabul by the Royal Air Force and spent the remainder of his life in exile. In August 1929, during the Afghan Civil War (1928–1929), there were rumours in Kabul that rupees bearing Inayatullah&#x27;s name were circulating among anti-Kalakani forces. This led some to believe that Inaytullah had begun to contest the Afghan throne. However, nothing came of this, and the rumours quickly subsided. Inayatullah remained in Iran, until his death in Tehran in 1946.

==Family==
Inayatullah and Khariya (Khariya, a daughter of Mahmud Tarzi) had Khalilullah Seraj (born 1910), Ruhullah Seraj (born 1911, died 1913), Zaynab Seraj, Mastura Seraj, Humaira Seraj, Hamidullah Enayat Seraj (born c.1923), Roqya Seraj (born 1918), Hamida Seraj (born 1920), Khayrullah Enayat Seraj (born 1921), Esmatullah Enayat Seraj (born 1922), Latifa Seraj (born 1923), Anisa Seraj (born 1924), Nafisa Seraj (born 1925).

<text>Matthew David Cameron (born November 28, 1962) is an American musician who is the drummer for the rock band Pearl Jam. He first gained fame as the drummer for Seattle-based rock band Soundgarden, which he joined in 1986. He appeared on each of the band&#x27;s studio albums until its initial break-up in 1997. In 1998, Cameron was invited to join Pearl Jam&#x27;s U.S. Yield Tour and then became a permanent member of the band, replacing Jack Irons. Following Soundgarden&#x27;s reunion in 2010, Cameron became simultaneously a member of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. He remained with the band until its second break-up after the death of lead singer Chris Cornell in 2017. Cameron, along with guitarist Kim Thayil and Cornell, is one of three members to feature on every Soundgarden studio album.

Additionally, Cameron was a member of Temple of the Dog (with fellow Soundgarden and Pearl Jam bandmates) and has served as the drummer for the side project bands Nighttime Boogie Association, Hater and Wellwater Conspiracy, also acting as the lead singer for the latter. Prior to joining Soundgarden, Cameron was a member of the Seattle rock bands Bam Bam and Skin Yard.

In 2016, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Cameron 52nd on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Drummers of All Time&quot;. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Pearl Jam on April 7, 2017. Cameron has won two Grammy Awards as a member of Soundgarden.

==Early life==
Matt Cameron was born and raised in San Diego, California. Cameron began playing drums at an early age. At the age of thirteen, he and some friends played in a cover band called &quot;Kiss&quot; (with the word &quot;imitation&quot; written underneath the name, in small print). During this stint, he met Paul Stanley. However, after a letter from the management of the band Kiss threatened the boys with legal action if they did not cease their infringement, the band melted away.

Cameron attended Bonita Vista High School. In 1978, under the pseudonym &quot;Foo Cameron&quot;, Cameron sang the song &quot;Puberty Love&quot;, which was featured in the movie &quot;Attack of the Killer Tomatoes&quot;. The nickname &quot;Foo&quot; came from Cameron&#x27;s older brother Pete, who pronounced Matthew as &quot;Ma Foo&quot;.

==Musical career==

===Bam Bam (1983-1984) &amp; Skin Yard (1985–1986)===

In 1983, Cameron moved to Seattle, Washington, where he got a job working at a Kinko&#x27;s. His first professional work as drummer was for Bam Bam, fronted by early grunge lead singer Tina Bell and guitarist Tommy Martin, the parents of Academy Award winning documentary film director TJ Martin. 

He next played in the local instrumental band feeDBack with musician Daniel House. Following feeDBack, Cameron joined House in 1985 in the newly formed Skin Yard. The band had been formed in January 1985 by House and Jack Endino. Cameron stayed with the group for almost a year. In 1986, Skin Yard contributed two songs to the now-legendary &quot;Deep Six&quot; compilation. This album was the first to showcase the early grunge sound. The band released its first album in 1986, the eponymous &quot;Skin Yard&quot;. Cameron wrote the song &quot;Reptile&quot; for the band, which appears on its first record. (More of Cameron&#x27;s work with Skin Yard can be found on the 2001 rarities compilation, &quot;Start at the Top&quot;.) Shortly after the release of &quot;Skin Yard&quot;, Cameron left the band, later joining Soundgarden.

===Soundgarden (1986–1997; 2010–2017)===

By September 1986, Cameron had gained so much notoriety in the local music scene that he was chosen to play for Soundgarden, replacing drummer Scott Sundquist. Soundgarden was made up of vocalist/guitarist Chris Cornell, guitarist Kim Thayil, and bassist Hiro Yamamoto. Cornell said, &quot;When I first met Matt, he was already the best drummer in town ... He just seemed very confident and well-adjusted.&quot; The band signed with the independent label Sub Pop and released the &quot;Screaming Life&quot; EP in 1987 and the &quot;Fopp&quot; EP in 1988. In 1988, the band signed with legendary punk record label SST Records and released its debut full-length album &quot;Ultramega OK&quot;. The album earned the band its first major award nomination, a Grammy Award, in 1990. The band subsequently signed with A&amp;M Records, becoming the first grunge band to sign to a major label. In 1989, the band released its first album for a major label, &quot;Louder Than Love&quot;. Following the release of &quot;Louder Than Love&quot;, Yamamoto left the band to finish his master&#x27;s degree in Physical Chemistry at Western Washington University. He was replaced by former Nirvana guitarist Jason Everman. Everman was fired following Soundgarden&#x27;s tour supporting &quot;Louder Than Love&quot;.

In 1990, the band was joined by a new bassist, Ben Shepherd. The new line-up released &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; in 1991. The album brought the band to a new level of commercial success, and the band found itself amidst the sudden popularity and attention given to the Seattle music scene and the genre known as grunge. &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1992. The band&#x27;s next album was to be its breakthrough. &quot;Superunknown&quot;, released in 1994, debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and launched several successful singles, including &quot;Spoonman&quot; and &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot;. Cameron&#x27;s drumming is showcased throughout the album, as he provides the complex backbeat (and plenty of improvisation) to the unusual time signatures present on many of the tracks. The album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 1995. Two singles from &quot;Superunknown&quot;, &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; and &quot;Spoonman&quot;, won Grammy Awards, and the music video for &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; won a MTV Video Music Award and a Clio Award. &quot;Superunknown&quot; was ranked number 336 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; was ranked number 25 on VH1&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest songs of the &#x27;90s. In 1996, the band released its fifth studio album, &quot;Down on the Upside&quot;; while successful, the album could not emulate the precedent set by &quot;Superunknown&quot;. Tensions within the group arose during the &quot;Down on the Upside&quot; sessions, with Thayil and Cornell reportedly clashing over Cornell&#x27;s desire to shift away from the heavy guitar riffing that had become the band&#x27;s trademark. In 1997, Soundgarden received another Grammy nomination, for the lead single &quot;Pretty Noose&quot;. In 1997, the band broke up due to internal strife over its creative direction. In a 1998 interview, Thayil said, &quot;It was pretty obvious from everybody&#x27;s general attitude over the course of the previous half-year that there was some dissatisfaction.&quot; Cameron later said that Soundgarden was &quot;eaten up by the business.&quot;

On January 1, 2010, Cornell announced on his Twitter that Soundgarden would be reuniting. The official website relaunched soon thereafter. The band had begun recording a new album in February 2011, which was later released in November 2012, known as King Animal. 

While a member of Soundgarden, Cameron wrote the following songs for the band:
* &quot;He Didn&#x27;t&quot; (&quot;Ultramega OK&quot;) ... music
* &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot; (&quot;Badmotorfinger&quot;) ... music (co-written)
* &quot;Room a Thousand Years Wide&quot; (&quot;Badmotorfinger&quot;) ... music
* &quot;Drawing Flies&quot; (&quot;Badmotorfinger&quot;) ... music
* &quot;New Damage&quot; (&quot;Badmotorfinger&quot;) ... music (co-written)
* &quot;Birth Ritual&quot; (&quot;Singles&quot; ) ... music (co-written)
* &quot;Exit Stonehenge&quot; (&quot;Spoonman&quot; single) ... music (co-written)
* &quot;Mailman&quot; (&quot;Superunknown&quot;) ... music, and played mellotron
* &quot;Limo Wreck&quot; (&quot;Superunknown&quot;) ... music (co-written)
* &quot;Fresh Tendrils&quot; (&quot;Superunknown&quot;) ... lyrics (co-written) and music
* &quot;Jerry Garcia&#x27;s Finger&quot; (&quot;Songs from the Superunknown&quot;) ... music (co-written)
* &quot;Rhinosaur&quot; (&quot;Down on the Upside&quot;) ... music
* &quot;Applebite&quot; (&quot;Down on the Upside&quot;) ... music, and played Moog synthesizer
* &quot;A Splice of Space Jam&quot; (&quot;Blow Up the Outside World&quot; single) ... music (co-written)
* &quot;By Crooked Steps&quot; (&quot;King Animal&quot;) ... music (co-written)
* &quot;Eyelid&#x27;s Mouth&quot; (&quot;King Animal&quot;) ... music

The task of figuring out the time signatures for Soundgarden&#x27;s songs was usually left to Cameron. Regarding his drumming with Soundgarden, &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; stated that Cameron &quot;always injected a maturity into Soundgarden&#x27;s music. His ghost-note grooves and the uncanny ability to make odd time feel like straight time have already earned him status among rock&#x27;s drumming&#x27;s elite pacemakers.&quot;

On November 15, 2013, Cameron announced that he would not be touring with Soundgarden in 2014, due to prior commitments promoting Pearl Jam&#x27;s album &quot;Lightning Bolt&quot;.

=== Pearl Jam (1998–present) ===
Almost a year after Soundgarden&#x27;s break-up, in summer 1998, Cameron was invited by rock-colleagues Pearl Jam to drum on its U.S. Yield Tour after the band&#x27;s drummer Jack Irons left due to the touring scheduling conflicting with his health issues and a desire to spend more time with his family. Cameron had worked with members of the band before on the Temple of the Dog project and had helped them record some early instrumental demos in 1990. Cameron said, &quot;I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly (Curtis, Pearl Jam&#x27;s manager). I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He called and said &#x27;hey what are you doing this summer?&#x27;&quot; Guitarist Mike McCready said, &quot;We knew him from being around the same scene and seeing him on tour. It had a lot to do with it. We knew he was a normal cat too, a normal guy.&quot; Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. He was hired on an initially temporary basis, but soon, during the tour, he was invited to become a full-time member. Cameron stated, &quot;The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn&#x27;t a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they&#x27;ve been through so many different drummers, I don&#x27;t even know if they knew what they wanted. So, I just kind of played the way I played and then eventually we kind of figured out what worked best for the band.&quot;

Cameron has since become the longest serving drummer of the band. McCready stated that Cameron has made Pearl Jam &quot;into a way better band.&quot; In 1998, Pearl Jam, with Cameron on drums, recorded &quot;Last Kiss&quot;, a cover of a 1960s ballad made famous by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers. It was released on the band&#x27;s 1998 fan club Christmas single; however, by popular demand, the cover was released to the public as a single in 1999. &quot;Last Kiss&quot; peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and became the band&#x27;s highest-charting single. In 2000, the band released its sixth studio album, &quot;Binaural&quot;, and initiated a successful and ongoing series of official bootlegs. The band released seventy-two such live albums in 2000 and 2001, and set a record for most albums to debut in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at the same time. &quot;Grievance&quot; (from &quot;Binaural&quot;) received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. The band released its seventh studio album, &quot;Riot Act&quot;, in 2002. Pearl Jam&#x27;s contribution to the 2003 film, &quot;Big Fish&quot;, &quot;Man of the Hour&quot;, was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in 2004. The band&#x27;s eighth studio album, the eponymous &quot;Pearl Jam&quot;, was released in 2006. The band released its ninth studio album, &quot;Backspacer&quot;, in 2009. Their tenth studio album &quot;Lightning Bolt&quot; was released in 2013. Their eleventh studio album &quot;Gigaton&quot; was released March 27, 2020. In May 2022, Cameron was forced to miss his first shows in 24 years since joining Pearl Jam due to testing positive for the COVID-19 virus. Josh Klinghoffer and Richard Stuverud filled in on drums for Cameron. He tested positive again In September 2023 whilst the band were on a US tour forcing him to miss out on the first night in Indianapolis with Klinghoffer once again filling in for him this time for the whole show.

Since joining Pearl Jam, Cameron has written the following songs for the band:
* &quot;Evacuation&quot; (&quot;Binaural&quot;) ... music
* &quot;Save You&quot; (&quot;Riot Act&quot;) ... music (co-written)
* &quot;Cropduster&quot; (&quot;Riot Act&quot;) ... music
* &quot;You Are&quot; (&quot;Riot Act&quot;) ... lyrics (co-written), music, played rhythm guitar, and sang background vocals
* &quot;Get Right&quot; (&quot;Riot Act&quot;) ... lyrics and music
* &quot;In the Moonlight&quot; (&quot;Lost Dogs&quot;) ... lyrics and music
* &quot;Unemployable&quot; (&quot;Pearl Jam&quot;) ... music (co-written)
* &quot;The Fixer&quot; (&quot;Backspacer&quot;) ... music (co-written)
* &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; (&quot;Backspacer&quot;) ... music (co-written)
* &quot;Dance of the Clairvoyants&quot; (&quot;Gigaton&quot;) ... music (co-written)
* &quot;Take the Long Way&quot; (&quot;Gigaton&quot;) ... lyrics, music, played guitar, and sang background vocals

While not as frequent as the other members&#x27; written contributions, Cameron&#x27;s are held in high regard by the band, as are his performances. In the liner notes of the 2003 &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; compilation, Pearl Jam vocalist Eddie Vedder says:
Matt Cameron writes songs and we run to find step stools in order to reach his level, ... what comes naturally to him leaves us with our heads cocked like the confused dogs that we are, ... eventually getting it. Did we mention he&#x27;s the greatest drummer on the planet?

===Other musical projects (1990–present)===

Along with Cornell, Stone Gossard, Jeff Ament, McCready, and Vedder, Cameron appeared on the 1991 &quot;Temple of the Dog&quot; album. The album paid tribute to Mother Love Bone vocalist Andrew Wood, who died of a heroin overdose at age 24.

He has played in two jazz-influenced side projects: Tone Dogs in the early 1990s, and Harrybu McCage, which formed in 2008. He recorded with the Tone Dogs for their debut album &quot;Ankety Low Day&quot;, which was released in 1990. Cameron also has a fondness for psychedelic garage rock, and his side projects Hater and Wellwater Conspiracy reflect this. Cameron formed Hater in 1993 with Soundgarden bassist Ben Shepherd. The band released a self-titled album in 1993 and recorded a second album in 1995 following Soundgarden&#x27;s &quot;Superunknown&quot; tour. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;The 2nd&quot;, would not see release until 2005. Cameron founded Wellwater Conspiracy with Shepherd and guitarist John McBain. The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Declaration of Conformity&quot;, was released in 1997. Following Shepherd&#x27;s departure from the band in 1998, Cameron took over lead vocal duties for the band. Cameron and McBain maintained the group after Cameron joined Pearl Jam, and a further three Wellwater Conspiracy albums were released following the band&#x27;s debut album (&quot;Brotherhood of Electric: Operational Directives&quot; (1999), &quot;The Scroll and Its Combinations&quot; (2001), and &quot;Wellwater Conspiracy&quot; (2003)).

He worked with electronic punk act The Prodigy on their album The Fat of the Land, playing on the track &quot;Narayan&quot;.

Cameron appears on the Gamma Ray 7&quot;, which would become the first recorded material by Queens of the Stone Age. Cameron played drums at the band&#x27;s first show on November 20, 1997, at the OK Hotel in Seattle, however he did not join the band as its drummer. He also appeared with them in 2008, at the memorial concert for Natasha Shneider, playing double drums along with their then-current drummer Joey Castillo, of which various Queens of the Stone Age and Desert Sessions songs, as well as covers by artist including The Doors and Cream were played.

Cameron contributed his drumming on seven tracks considered for The Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; 1998 album, &quot;Adore&quot;, though only &quot;For Martha&quot; appeared on the album. Another studio track, &quot;Because You Are&quot;, surfaced on the 2001 B-sides and rarities collection, &quot;Judas O&quot;. Rumors circulated in the beginning of 1998 that he was considered as a permanent drummer replacement for Jimmy Chamberlin, but Cameron denied this.

Other drumming contributions by Cameron include four tracks on Eleven&#x27;s 1995 album, &quot;Thunk&quot;, the track &quot;Disappearing One&quot; on former bandmate Chris Cornell&#x27;s 1999 solo album, &quot;Euphoria Morning&quot;, and Geddy Lee&#x27;s 2000 solo album, &quot;My Favourite Headache&quot;.

Cameron has enjoyed a friendship with fellow drummer Jeremy Taggart of Canadian rock group Our Lady Peace. When Taggart was sidelined with an ankle injury during the recording of that group&#x27;s 2000 album, &quot;Spiritual Machines&quot;, Cameron played drums on two songs on the album, &quot;Right Behind You (Mafia)&quot; and &quot;Are You Sad?&quot;. Cameron contributed to the soundtrack for the 2002 film &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, playing on &quot;Hero&quot; with Chad Kroeger and Josey Scott. As Cameron was unable to attend the shoot, Jeremy Taggart returned the favor and is shown in Cameron&#x27;s place in the video.

Cameron, along with Pearl Jam bandmate Mike McCready, contributed two songs to Peter Frampton&#x27;s instrumental album, &quot;Fingerprints&quot; (2006). These include a cover of Soundgarden&#x27;s &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; and &quot;Blowin&#x27; Smoke&quot;.

Cameron has lent his talents to Submersible Music&#x27;s DrumCore software.

In 2013, Cameron performed with drummers Janet Weiss of Sleater Kinney, and Zach Hill of Death Grips on an all-drum album entitled &quot;Drumgasm&quot;.

In 2020, Nighttime Boogie Association released their first two singles. The supergroup formed by Cameron, Taylor Hawkins, Buzz Osborne and Steven McDonald plans to release more music in 2021.

In 2021 Cameron, along with Kim Thayil, bassist Krist Novoselic (Nirvana, Giants in the Trees), guitarist Bubba Dupree (Hater, Void), and vocalists Jennifer Johnson and Jillian Raye (Giants in the Trees) formed the group 3rd Secret. Their self-titled debut album, which they recorded at The Bait Shop in Bellevue, Washington with producer Jack Endino was released in April 2022. The group also performed at the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle.

Also in 2021, Cameron and Thayil were featured on the track Only Love Can Save Me Now on the Pretty Reckless album, Death by Rock and Roll, with both appearing in the video for the song.

===Career timeline===
==Musical style and influences==
Cameron was described by Greg Prato of AllMusic as &quot;unquestionably one of rock&#x27;s finest and most versatile drummers&quot;. Known for his creativity, power, and precision, Cameron&#x27;s style is one that does not instinctively seek to dominate a song, but rather tease out a groove that will complement and support its atmosphere. Examples of this can be clearly heard in Temple of the Dog&#x27;s &quot;Wooden Jesus&quot; or Soundgarden&#x27;s &quot;Mind Riot&quot; and &quot;Applebite&quot;. Cameron&#x27;s time in Pearl Jam has helped see his technique mellow to a more modest backing role, providing support for the more straightforward nature of Pearl Jam&#x27;s matured style compared to Soundgarden&#x27;s more extreme and unusual tendencies, e.g., the song &quot;Face Pollution&quot;. Despite a career in rock music, Cameron stated in a 1989 radio interview that growing up he &quot;wasn&#x27;t a big rock fan ...&quot; and that his musical tastes during his youth were &quot;more into jazz.&quot; Cameron has professed that his primary musical interests lie in progressive rock and various jazz subgenres, including hard bop, both of which are characterized by a much busier playing style than Cameron typically exhibits, especially in the aforementioned matured Pearl Jam. Cameron has cited Keith Moon of the Who as his biggest musical influence.

Cameron tends to revisit the paradiddle for effect. Examples include the spreading of the RLRR-LRLL pattern amongst ride and snare on Soundgarden&#x27;s &quot;Never the Machine Forever&quot; (from &quot;Down on the Upside&quot;), &quot;Unemployable&quot; (from &quot;Pearl Jam&quot;), creating a driving shuffle; and &quot;You Are&quot; (from &quot;Riot Act&quot;). This pattern can also be heard during the bridge of &quot;Bleed Together&quot; (from the &quot;Burden in My Hand&quot; single). Cameron also is well known for his use of tom grooves and tribal patterns, the most famous of which being the tour-de-force &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot; figure, as well as &quot;Little Joe&quot;, &quot;Gun&quot;, and &quot;Spoonman&quot;. Cameron also incorporated the technique of open-handed drumming into his playing, particularly around the &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; period in Soundgarden, specifically the tracks &quot;Slaves &amp; Bulldozers&quot;, the outro of &quot;Rusty Cage&quot;, and &quot;Somewhere&quot;, and used the technique later on &quot;Superunknown&quot; &quot;Limo Wreck.&quot;

==Equipment==
Throughout the 80s and 90s, Cameron favored two to three crashes (generally matching 19-inch Zildjian Avedis Rock crashes and eventually Z Customs by &quot;Superunknown&quot; touring period), an A or K ride of 20 or 21 inches, and 15-inch hi hats with an occasional 10-inch splash or bell. China cymbals were used throughout the &#x27;80s but infrequently in the &#x27;90s, and were eliminated from his live setup by &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot;. Even after becoming a full-time member of Pearl Jam, Cameron&#x27;s cymbal setup did not change radically from his Soundgarden days. Currently, the most noticeable difference is his use of the A and K series as opposed to the heavier Z Custom series.

Though Cameron is best known for his use of equipment from California-based Drum Workshop during his initial time with Soundgarden, he used his own Yamaha kit before 1990 when he started using DW, which he later admittedly approached after Yamaha first turned down his endorsement. Most early Soundgarden records up until &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; including the Temple of the Dog record were done with an 8000 series kit in a &quot;real wood&quot; finish. By the autumn of 1991, however, Cameron started playing copper gloss finished DW&#x27;s with 12 and 13-inch rack toms, a 15-inch floor tom, and a 22-inch bass drum with black gloss hoops and a 14-inch knurled steel snare. By 1993 his &quot;Superunknown&quot; era kit arrived, a black gloss kit with 12, 13, and a 14-inch hanging tom, which Cameron would mount on a snare stand, a 16-inch floor tom and a 24x16 inch bass drum. Cameron revealed in a 1994 interview with &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine that to greater emphasize the dynamic shift on the song &quot;Like Suicide&quot;, both kits were used, the latter having shells both larger in depth and diameter. &quot;Superunknown&quot; is well known for its huge drum sound and practices such as this brought attention in the drumming world. Other examples include the use of all ride cymbals on &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; and 3 drummers playing at the same time at the end of &quot;Head Down&quot;, being Cameron, Soundgarden bassist Ben Shepherd and drum technician and craftsman Gregg Keplinger. Cameron, along with fellow Northwesterner William Goldsmith (Sunny Day Real Estate and Foo Fighters), was an early user of Keplinger&#x27;s snares, famous for perhaps being the heaviest stainless steel snare drum available.

By the recording of 1996&#x27;s &quot;Down on the Upside&quot;, and the album&#x27;s subsequent tour, Cameron endorsed the Canadian custom outfit Ayotte, a company Keplinger had teamed with offering mass-produced steel snares, and soon cohorts and fellow Keplinger fans Jeremy Taggart (Our Lady Peace), Matt Chamberlain (Pearl Jam, session), and Joey Waronker (Beck, Atoms for Peace) joined as well. During the recording of &quot;Down on the Upside&quot; in 1995 and a short European tour in the middle of making it, Cameron used natural maple finished Ayotte&#x27;s with wood hoops with 10, 12, and 13-inch rack toms, 16 and 18-inch floor toms, and a 22-inch bass drum, with Ayotte/Keplinger snares or his longtime favorite Keplinger 14x7 stainless steel snare. By the album&#x27;s official tour in 1996, a new kit with updated OEM hardware made by Tay-e, including bass drum mounted tom mounts, in the same sizes but with dark purple sparkle finish and a 24-inch silver sparkle bass drum was used all the way up to Soundgarden&#x27;s breakup. Following his hiring for Pearl Jam&#x27;s U.S. Yield Tour in 1998 Cameron continued using his purple Ayotte kit, which would stay intact for the most part for the next 4 years including touring for &quot;Binaural&quot; in 2000. All throughout this period Cameron continued using equipment manufactured by DW, including pedals, cymbal stands, and snare stands.

Following a corporate mutiny resulting in the resignation of Ray Ayotte from his own company and the subsequent end in partnership with Gregg Keplinger, Cameron switched to Yamaha in 2002, and Cameron&#x27;s subsequent time with Pearl Jam is notable for his shift away from maple-shelled drums, arguably the most popular drum material for its overall even frequency response and overall melodic tone. Cameron began endorsing and using Yamaha&#x27;s Birch Custom Absolute drums in a vintage natural finish that year. Compared to maple shelled drums, birch is higher-pitched with a quicker attack and produces fewer overtones. By 2009, he began experimenting with another type of wood, the Yamaha Oak Custom in a black gloss finish with Yamaha Vintage Maple hoops, similar to his old Ayotte&#x27;s. Oak drums are noted for their additional attack and projection, with a similar fundamental tone to maple. He used this kit through the period of Soundgarden&#x27;s reformation.

In 2018 Cameron returned to maple with Yamaha&#x27;s Absolute Hybrid Maple in a satin black stain but with stock steel hoops. His current setup continues his longtime use of 12, 13, 16-inch toms, with a shallow 24 bass drum, more specifically 12×8, 13×9, 16×16, and 24×14. He occasionally uses a 14×14 floor tom on his left side and an 18×16 floor tom when not using 14×7 Alex Acuña timbale for certain songs in Pearl Jam. His switches his snares between his various Gregg Keplinger built models and Yamaha productions, varying from copper and aluminum shelled models to discontinued signature snares for David Garibaldi, Roy Haynes, and Steve Gadd. Lately he has also experimented with Kapur shelled Yamaha Club Customs and his Yamaha/Steve Gadd 30th anniversary drum set. He has also used a Yamaha Steve Jordan signature cocktail kit live occasionally.

Matt endorses Yamaha drums and hardware, Zildjian cymbals, Vic Firth drumsticks, and Remo Drumheads.

==Personal life==
Cameron married his longtime girlfriend April Acevez on October 25, 1997. They reside in Woodway, Washington with their two children, son Ray (born October 25, 1998) and daughter Josie. Outside of his music career, Cameron is an avid runner.

Cameron&#x27;s favorite literary author is Franz Kafka.

<text>The Sugar Act 1764 or Sugar Act 1763 (4 Geo. 3. c. 15), also known as the American Revenue Act 1764 or the American Duties Act, was a revenue-raising act passed by the Parliament of Great Britain on 5 April 1764. The preamble to the act stated: &quot;it is expedient that new provisions and regulations should be established for improving the revenue of this Kingdom ... and ... it is just and necessary that a revenue should be raised ... for defraying the expenses of defending, protecting, and securing the same.&quot; The earlier Molasses Act 1733, which had imposed a tax of six pence per gallon of molasses, had never been effectively collected due to colonial evasion. By reducing the rate by half and increasing measures to enforce the tax, Parliament hoped that the tax would actually be collected. These incidents increased the colonists&#x27; concerns about the intent of the British Parliament and helped the growing movement that became the American Revolution.

==Background==
The Molasses Act 1733 was passed by Parliament largely at the insistence of large plantation owners in the British West Indies. Molasses from French, Dutch, and Spanish West Indian possessions was inexpensive. Producers of sugar from the British West Indies priced sugar much higher than their competitors, and they had no need for the large quantities of lumber, fish, and other items offered by the colonies in exchange. Sometimes colonists would pay Molasses Act taxes because they were rather low depending on where they resided and how much money they had. In the first part of the 18th century, the British West Indies were Great Britain&#x27;s most important trading partner, so Parliament was attentive to their requests. However, rather than acceding to their demands to prohibit the colonies from trading with the non-British islands, Parliament passed a prohibitively high tax on the colonies on molasses imported from those islands. If actually collected, the tax would have effectively closed that source to New England and destroyed much of the rum industry. Instead, smuggling, bribery or intimidation of customs officials effectively nullified the law.

During the Seven Years&#x27; War, known in Colonial America as the French and Indian War, the British government substantially increased the national debt to pay for the war. In February 1763, as the war ended, the ministry headed by John Stuart, the Earl of Bute, decided to maintain a standing army of ten thousand British regular troops in the colonies. Shortly thereafter, George Grenville replaced Bute. Grenville supported his predecessor&#x27;s policy, even more so after the outbreak of Pontiac&#x27;s War in May 1763. Grenville faced the problem of not only paying for these troops but servicing the national debt. The debt grew from £75,000,000 before the war to £122,600,000 in January 1763, and almost £130,000,000 by the beginning of 1764.

George Grenville did not expect the colonies to contribute to the interest or the retirement of the debt, but he did expect the Americans to pay a portion of the expenses for colonial defense. Estimating the expenses of maintaining an army in the Continental colonies and the West Indies to be approximately £200,000 annually, Grenville devised a revenue-raising program that would raise an estimated £79,000 per year.

==Passage==
The Molasses Act 1733 was set to expire in 1763. The Commissioners of Customs anticipated greater demand for both molasses and rum as a result of the end of the war and the acquisition of Canada. They believed that the increased demand would make a sharply reduced rate both affordable and collectible. When passed by Parliament, the new Sugar Act 1764 halved the previous tax on molasses. In addition to promising stricter enforcement, the language of the bill made it clear that the purpose of the legislation was not to simply regulate the trade (as the Molasses Act had attempted to do by effectively closing the legal trade to non-British suppliers) but to raise revenue.

The new act listed specific goods, the most important being lumber, which could only be exported to Britain. Ship captains were required to maintain detailed manifests of their cargo and the papers were subject to verification before anything could be unloaded from the ships. Customs officials were empowered to have all violations tried in vice admiralty courts rather than by jury trials in local colonial courts, where the juries generally looked favourably on smuggling as a profession.

American historian Fred Anderson wrote that the purpose of the Act was &quot;to resolve the problems of finance and control that plagued the postwar empire&quot;. To do this &quot;three kinds of measures&quot; were implemented – &quot;those intended to make customs enforcement more effective, those that placed new duties on items widely consumed in America, and those that adjusted old rates in such a way as to maximize revenues.&quot;

==Effect on the American colonies==

The Sugar Act was passed by Parliament on 5 April 1764, and it arrived in the colonies at a time of economic depression. A good part of the reason was that a significant portion of the colonial economy during the Seven Years&#x27; War was involved with supplying food and supplies to the British Army. Colonials, however, especially those affected directly as merchants and shippers, assumed that the highly visible new tax program was the major culprit. As protests against the Sugar Act developed, it was the economic impact rather than the constitutional issue of taxation without representation that was the main focus for the colonists.

New England ports especially suffered economic losses from the Sugar Act as the stricter enforcement made smuggling molasses more dangerous and risky. Also they argued that the profit margin on rum was too small to support any tax on molasses. Forced to increase their prices, many colonists feared being priced out of the market. The British West Indies, on the other hand, now had unrestricted exports. With supply of molasses well exceeding demand, the islands prospered with their reduced expenses while New England ports saw revenue from their rum exports decrease. Also the West Indies had been the primary colonial source for hard currency, or specie, and as the reserves of specie were depleted the soundness of colonial currency was threatened.

Two prime movers behind the protests against the Sugar Act were Samuel Adams and James Otis, both of Massachusetts. In May 1764 Samuel Adams drafted a report on the Sugar Act for the Massachusetts assembly, in which he denounced the act as an infringement of the rights of the colonists as British subjects:

In August 1764, fifty Boston merchants agreed to stop purchasing British luxury imports, and in both Boston and New York City there were movements to increase colonial manufacturing. There were sporadic outbreaks of violence, most notably in Rhode Island. Overall, however, there was not an immediate high level of protest over the Sugar Act in either New England or the rest of the colonies. That would begin in the later part of the next year when the Stamp Act 1765 was passed.

The Sugar Act 1764 was replaced with the Revenue Act 1766, which reduced the tax to one penny per gallon on molasses imports, British or foreign. This occurred around the same time that the Stamp Act 1765 was repealed.

<text>Inge Haraldsson (; 1135 – 3 February 1161) was king of Norway (being Inge I) from 1136 to 1161. Inge’s reign fell within the start of the period known in Norwegian history as the civil war era, and he was never the sole ruler of the country. He is often known as Inge the Hunchback (; ), because of his physical disability. However, this epithet does not appear in medieval sources.

==Childhood and accession==
Inge was the only son of King Harald Gille by his wife, Ingiríðr Ragnvaldsdóttir. At the time, however, legitimate birth was not an important factor in determining succession to the throne. Inge was fostered by &quot;Ögmund&quot; or &quot;Ámund Gyrðarson&quot; in eastern Norway. His father, Harald, was murdered in 1136 by the pretender Sigurd Slembe. The one-year-old Inge was named king at the thing of &quot;Borgarting&quot; near Sarpsborg. His two half-brothers, also infants, Magnus and Sigurd, were also named king at other things. Their respective guardians joined forces against Sigurd Slembe and his ally, the former king Magnus the Blind. In 1139, they were defeated and killed at the Battle of Holmengrå. According to the sagas Morkinskinna and Heimskringla, Inge’s infirmity stemmed from having been carried into battle by one of his guardians during a battle in 1137: “&quot;...his back was knotted into a hump, and the one foot was shorter than the other; and he was besides so infirm that he could scarcely walk as long as he lived.&quot;” The Danish chronicler Saxo Grammaticus offers the alternative explanation that he became a hunchback after having been dropped on the floor by a maid during infancy. During the minority of Inge, Sigurd and Magnus, the country was ruled in peace by their guardians, prominent among whom was Inge’s mother, queen Ingiriðr. Magnus, of whom little more is known, died at some point in the 1140s. In 1142, a fourth, older brother, Eystein, came to Norway from Scotland, where he had grown up. Harald Gille had acknowledged Eystein as a son before his death, and Eystein was therefore given a share of the kingdom.

==Adulthood and reign==
The division of the kingdom does not seem to have been territorial, all brothers seem to have held equal regal status over all parts of the country. According to the sagas, relations between the brothers were peaceful as long as their guardians were alive. This period of their reign saw the establishment of an independent Norwegian Archiepiscopacy in Nidaros (Trondheim) in 1152. As their guardians died, and the brothers grew up, conflict broke out.

In 1155, a meeting between the brothers in Bergen resulted in fighting breaking out between the men of king Inge and king Sigurd, in which king Sigurd was killed. King Eystein was late in arriving for the meeting, and only approached the city after Sigurd was already dead. An uneasy settlement was reached between Inge and Eystein. The reasons for the fighting in Bergen remain disputed. According to the sagas, Eystein and Sigurd had plotted to strip Inge of his royal title and divide his share of the kingdom between them. Some modern historians doubt this version, seeing it as Inge’s excuse for his own aggressive actions. In any event, peace between Inge and Eystein did not hold for long after the events of 1155. In 1157, both sides gathered their forces for a confrontation. Inge’s forces outnumbered Eystein’s, and when they met, on the west coast near Moster, Eystein’s forces melted away. Eystein was forced to flee, he was caught and killed in Bohuslän later the same year.

Inge was now the last remaining brother. However, the supporters of Sigurd and Eystein united behind a son of Sigurd, Haakon the Broadshouldered. They renewed the fight against Inge. &quot;Heimskringla&quot; notes that Inge was popular among the “chieftains” – the lendmenn – because he allowed them a great say in the running of the kingdom. Foremost among his advisors was the &quot;lendmann&quot; Gregorius Dagsson, another prominent supporter was Erling Skakke. The king’s mother, who survived her son, also appears to have remained influential throughout his reign.
7 January 1161, Gregorius was killed in a skirmish with king Haakon’s forces.
On 3 February the same year, Inge was defeated and killed, leading his men into battle against King Haakon near Oslo, after many of his men, led by his vassal Guðrøðr Óláfsson, the exiled King of the Isles, defected to King Haakon’s side. He was buried in St. Hallvard’s church in Oslo.

==Aftermath==
The period of peace during the minority of king Inge and his brothers – from 1129 until 1155 - was the longest peaceful period Norway was to see until 1240, as the dispute between the brothers ushered in the Norwegian civil war era. &quot;Heimskringla&quot; describes Inge thus:

:&quot;King Inge was the handsomest among them in countenance. He had yellow but rather thin hair, which was much curled. His stature was small; and he had difficulty in walking alone, because he had one foot withered, and he had a hump both on his back and his breast. He was of cheerful conversation, and friendly towards his friends; was generous, and allowed other chiefs to give him counsel in governing the country. He was popular, therefore, with the public; and all this brought the kingdom and the mass of the people on his side.&quot;

After Inge’s fall, his supporters rallied behind the lendmann Erling Skakke and his son, king Magnus Erlingsson. This party is sometimes referred to as the &quot;lendmann-party&quot;. The sagas of king Inge do not mention any offspring, but one of the pretenders against king Sverre, Jon Kuvlung (died 1188), claimed to be Inge’s son.

==Sources==
The main sources to Inge’s reign are the kings’ sagas Heimskringla, Fagrskinna, Morkinskinna and Ágrip. The three former base at least part of their account on the older saga Hryggjarstykki, which was written some time between 1150 and 1170, and was thus a near-contemporary source. This saga itself has not been preserved.

<doc id="738438" wikidata="Q1494086" url="?curid=738438" title="Gardeners' Question Time">
<text>Gardeners&#x27; Question Time is a long running BBC Radio 4 programme in which amateur gardeners can put questions to a panel of experts.

==History==
The first programme was broadcast in the North and Northern Ireland Home Service of the BBC at 22:15 on 9 April 1947 and came from the &quot;singing room&quot; at the Broadoak Hotel, Ashton-under-Lyne. Originally entitled &quot;How Does Your Garden Grow?&quot;, it was inspired by the wartime Dig for Victory campaign. On the first panel were Bill Sowerbutts, Fred Loads, Tom Clark and Dr E.W. Sansome.

Professor Alan Gemmell joined Loads and Sowerbutts in 1950 when their contrasting styles (Professor, Traditional Head gardener and Commercial Grower) added an entertainment element. The success of the format led to the programme&#x27;s being broadcast nationally on Saturday mornings at 11:00 from 27 April to 13 July 1957 on the BBC Light Programme (under the title &quot;Down the Garden Path&quot;). In September 1957 the programme was transferred to the Home Service and gained its present title of &quot;Gardeners&#x27; Question Time&quot; as well as the time slot of 14:00 on Sundays which it has retained to this day. The programme marked its 1,000th edition in 1972, though the occasion was overshadowed by the death of long-serving chairman Franklin Engelmann just days earlier.

The format and panel remained largely unchanged for many years. In 1994, production moved to outside company Taylor Made Broadcast; the complete panel was discarded by the BBC and moved to the new Classic FM station on a short-term contract to present &quot;Classic Gardening Forum&quot;, sponsored by the Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society. In 2009, the production of the show was taken over by the UK&#x27;s largest independent radio production company Somethin&#x27; Else. The programme&#x27;s audience figures continue to perform strongly as confirmed by the official audience measurement body, RAJAR.

==Format==
The programme typically comes from a village hall or other public venue somewhere in Britain, or occasionally further afield, such as in the Republic of Ireland or northern France. &quot;GQT&quot; often records at special locations throughout the UK, including on a moving train, the peak of Snowdon, from inside the Tower of London and in December 2016 from the state dining room at 10 Downing Street.

There are also regular editions in which the panel answer questions sent in by post or email, known as &quot;postbag editions&quot;. These editions are recorded in a specially adapted potting shed at Sparsholt College near Sparsholt, Hampshire; however, in recent years postbag programmes have been recorded at various gardens around the UK, including at Highgrove, with Prince Charles, Kew Gardens, RHS Wisley, Ness Botanic Gardens and East Ruston Old Vicarage.

Each year the programme visits a botanic garden to stage its annual &quot;GQT&quot; Summer Garden Party. The event includes seminars and talks given by the panel, a chance to receive first hand advice from a panellist inside the &quot;GQT&quot; Potting Shed, plus two programme recordings. A highlight of the horticultural calendar, the event attracts a large audience of keen amateur gardeners. Most recently the Summer Garden Party has been hosted by Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, National Botanic Garden of Wales and Ness Botanic Gardens.

Since 2001, &quot;Gardeners&#x27; Question Time&quot; factsheets have been made available after each episode covering all questions and their given answers. The factsheets can be found by searching for a particular episode and scrolling down the page.

In 2009, the programme launched a podcast edition and a Twitter account, the latter designed to be a place where listeners can share gardening ideas and tips and comment on the radio programme&#x27;s topics and panellists&#x27; answers.

The programme regularly attracts an audience in excess of two million and has answered over 35,000 questions in its long run.

==Panellists==
Panellists include Matthew Wilson, Chris Beardshaw, Matthew Biggs, Bob Flowerdew, Pippa Greenwood, Bunny Guinness, Anne Swithinbank, James Wong and Christine Walkden.

Past participants have included John Cushnie, Dr Stefan Buczacki, David Burges, Fred Downham, Professor Alan Gemmell, Walter Gilmore, Jill Hicking, Clay Jones, Nigel Colborn, Daphne Ledward, Fred Loads, Bridget Moody, Martin Fish, David Jones, Sue Phillipps, Geoffrey Smith, Sid Robertson, and Bill Sowerbutts.

Past chairmen were Bob Stead, Franklin Engelmann, Michael Barratt, Steve Race, Ken Ford, Les Cottington, Clay Jones, and Stefan Buczacki. On 26 April 2019 Eric Robson, host for 25 years, chaired his last programme. His replacement as chair was BBC radio newsreader Kathy Clugston.

<text>Tsuen Wan West is an underground MTR station in Tsuen Wan, New Territories, Hong Kong. It is located between and stations on the . There is an emergency platform on the southern side of the station.

There is a large bus and minibus interchange above the station, connecting it with most residential areas, factories, and shopping centres in the area. With the opening of new developments in central Tsuen Wan such as the 80 storey Nina Tower, Vision City, and City Point, traffic to the station has increased. Additional MTR property development on nearby lands such as City Point and Pavilion Bay also commenced circa 2014. 

== History ==
The construction of the station was very complex. It required the diversion of some roads, the demolition of two factories, part of a nearby park, and the relocation of a ferry pier which originally occupied the site. The station was designed by Farrells. The waterfront promenade built along with the station&#x27;s construction connected the two ends of Tsuen Wan, significantly improved the scenery of the area, and provided a leisure place for many residents of southern and western Tsuen Wan.

Although the station is in the same region as Tsuen Wan station, the two stations have different fares. For example, passengers have to pay HK$1.7-4.0 more if they are going to Hong Kong Island, although it is faster and more convenient. Only out-of-system interchange is available for the pair.

On 20 December 2003, Tsuen Wan West station opened to the public with the first phase of the KCR West Rail.

The campsite for the 2012 edition of Brighton Community Church YF Camp &#x27;Deep and Wide&#x27; is located near this station and Tsuen Wan station on the Tsuen Wan line. The camp was held from the 17th to the 20th of December 2012. Team captains could decide to meet their team members at this station or Tsuen Wan station.

On 27 June 2021, the merged with the (which was already extended into the &quot;Tuen Ma line Phase 1&quot; at the time) in East Kowloon to form the new , as part of the Shatin to Central Link project. Hence, Tsuen Wan West is now an intermediate station on the Tuen Ma line.

<text>Julie Gregory (born 1969) is an American author of &quot;Sickened: The Memoir of a Munchausen by Proxy Childhood&quot;, an autobiographical account of the Münchausen syndrome by proxy abuse she suffered as a child.

==Childhood==
Gregory was raised in rural Ohio alongside her brother Danny, who was seven years younger than her. As a child, Gregory&#x27;s mother, Sandy Gregory, would give her matches to suck on as treats and withheld food from her daughter. Reasons for withholding food would include forgetting to fill the forms needed for school lunches and supposed allergies. Some days Gregory would wake up with her mother announcing she was too ill to go to school, or be pulled out of classes by her mother. 

During one doctor&#x27;s visit when Gregory was 12, she was asked to stand and began feeling faint due to a lack of food. The doctor, hearing her racing heart, became concerned that Gregory might have a heart problem, and recommended follow up tests. Her mother began telling others that Gregory had a heart condition and pursuing an open heart surgery that she deemed essential.

==Film appearances==
Julie Gregory starred in the film &quot;I Didn’t Think You Didn’t Know I Wasn’t Dead&quot; and &quot;My New Advisor&quot; by Columbus, Ohio, independent filmmaker Jim Bihari.

<doc id="738443" wikidata="Q2301192" url="?curid=738443" title="Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty">
<text>Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC) was an international animal rights campaign to close down Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS), Europe&#x27;s largest contract animal-testing laboratory. HLS tested medical and non-medical substances on around 75,000 animals every year, from rats to primates. It had been the subject of several major leaks or undercover investigations by activists and reporters since 1989.

SHAC was started by three British animal rights activists—Greg Avery, Heather James, and Natasha Dellemagne—after video footage supposed to have been shot covertly inside HLS in 1997 by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) showed HLS staff shaking, punching, and shouting at beagles in their care. The footage was broadcast by Channel 4 in the UK, the employees were dismissed and prosecuted, and HLS&#x27;s licence to perform animal experiments was revoked for six months. PETA stopped its protests against the company after HLS threatened it with legal action, and SHAC took over as a leaderless resistance.

The campaign used tactics ranging from protests and civil disobedience to the firebombing of private property connected with HLS&#x27; clients and investors. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which monitors US domestic extremism, has described SHAC&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot; as &quot;frankly terroristic tactics similar to those of anti-abortion extremists,&quot; and in 2005 an official with the FBI&#x27;s counter-terrorism division referred to SHAC&#x27;s activities in the United States as domestic terrorist threats.

In 2009 and 2010, 13 members of SHAC, including Avery, James, and Dellemagne, were jailed for between 15 months and eleven years on charges of conspiracy to blackmail or harm HLS and its suppliers.

==Background==

HLS tests household cleaners, pesticides, weedkillers, food additives, chemicals for use in industry, and drugs for use against Alzheimer&#x27;s, Parkinson&#x27;s, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. It kills around 75,000 animals every year, including rats, rabbits, pigs, dogs, and primates (marmosets and macaques).

The company has been the subject of several undercover investigations since 1989. Sarah Kite of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) secured a job and filmed inside HLS in 1989. Zoe Broughton did the same for Channel 4 in 1996, as Michelle Rokke claimed to have done for PETA in 1997. Lucy Johnston for &quot;The Daily Express&quot; gained access in 2000. A diary kept by Kite, who worked undercover there for eight months, alleged that HLS workers routinely mishandled the animals, shouting at them, throwing them into their cages, and mocking them for having fits in response to toxicity tests. In 1997, Zoe Broughton came out with footage showing puppies being hit and shaken. A year later, Michelle Rokke allegedly obtained footage of the vivisection of a monkey in HLS in New Jersey, in which a technician expresses concern that the animal is inadequately anaesthetized. Between 2006 and 2008, an Animal Defenders International employee filmed undercover inside HLS after securing a position inside its primate toxicology unit in Cambridgeshire.

According to Mark Matfield of the Research Defence Society, a pro-animal testing lobby group in the UK, HLS lost a great deal of business after these investigations, primarily among the pharmaceutical industry. &quot;There was an ingrained feeling among scientists and business people that this company had transgressed in a very serious way,&quot; he said.

==Structure==

===SHAC UK===

SHAC was founded in November 1999 by Greg Avery; his second wife, Natasha Avery (née Dellemagne); and his first wife, Heather Nicholson (née James). Avery and Nicholson had been involved in previous high-profile campaigns against facilities in the UK that bred animals for laboratories. In 1997, after a ten-month campaign, they caused the closure of Consort Kennels, which bred beagles for animal research. Later that year, they started Save the Hill Grove Cats against Hill Grove farm in Oxfordshire, which bred cats for laboratories. The farm closed after two years.

They would meet every three months to receive updates from colleagues in the United States and Europe. Sarah Whitehead, an experienced campaigner known in the group as &quot;Mumsy&quot;, would lead younger members and carry out up to five attacks in a night, according to the judge.

===Methods===

====Secondary and tertiary targeting====
SHAC&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot; is known as secondary and tertiary targeting. Activists engage in direct action—ranging from lawful protests to intimidation, harassment, and violent attacks—not only against HLS, its employees, and its employees&#x27; families, but also against secondary and tertiary targets such as HLS&#x27;s business partners, and &quot;their&quot; business partners, insurers, caterers, cleaners, children&#x27;s nursery schools, and office suppliers. A New York yacht club, for example, was covered in red paint because members of the club worked for Carr Securities, which traded in HLS shares. The campaign drove down HLS&#x27;s profits, suppressed its share price, and made it difficult to find business and financial partners.

In 2001, HLS managing director in the UK, Brian Cass, was beaten outside his home by three masked men – animal rights activist David Blenkinsop was sentenced to three years in prison for the attack – and HLS marketing director Andrew Gay was attacked on his doorstep with a chemical spray to his eyes that left him temporarily blinded.

====Shareholders====

On 21 December 2000, HLS was dropped from the New York Stock Exchange because its market capitalization had fallen below NYSE limits, and on 29 March 2001, HLS lost both of its market makers and its place on the London Stock Exchange. Shortly after this, HLS moved its headquarters to the United States, incorporating as Life Sciences Research (LSR), and secured a $15m loan from investment bank Stephens, Inc, its largest shareholder. In September 2005, after the firebombing of the homes of a Canadian brokerage employee and a British pharmaceutical executive, the New York Stock Exchange asked LSR to delay moving its listing from the OTC Bulletin Board to the main exchange. LSR has since transferred its listing to the NYSE Arca electronic exchange. HLS is no longer a publicly traded company after being bought by CEO Andrew Baker.

In June 2005, Vancouver-based brokerage Canaccord Capital announced that it had dropped a client, Phytopharm PLC, in response to the May 2005 Animal Liberation Front (ALF) firebombing of a car belonging to Canaccord executive Michael Kendall. The ALF stated on its website that activists placed an incendiary device under the car, which was in Kendall&#x27;s garage at home when it caught fire during the night. Kendall and his family went into hiding. Phytopharm was targeted, as were those doing business with it, because it had business links with HLS.

In May 2006, an anonymous group said it would be writing to every one of GlaxoSmithKline&#x27;s 170,000 small investors warning them to sell their shares. The letters began arriving at investors&#x27; home addresses on 7 May 2006, asking that shares be sold within 14 days, and that the group be informed of the sale by e-mail via a Hotmail address. The number of letters sent was smaller than claimed; the BBC said at least 50 shareholders received the warning. Writing in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; the following week, British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed support for animal experimentation in the face of an &quot;appalling ... campaign of intimidation.&quot;

===Ties to the ALF===
Kevin Kjonaas – who took charge of SHAC UK while the Averys and James were jailed for six months in 2002 – declared his support for the ALF, and Robin Webb, spokesman for the ALF in the UK, attended and addressed SHAC conferences in the United States.

In 2006 the ALF warned that it was targeting HLS suppliers, and that year firebombed a car belonging to the finance director of Canaccord Capital, a brokerage firm. Members of SHAC said the company had acted as brokers for Phytopharm, which had used HLS for contract testing.

The FBI linked SHAC with attacks claimed by the militant animal rights group, the Animal Liberation Brigade. They issued an arrest warrant for Daniel Andreas San Diego, who they described as being &quot;involved with the Stop Huntington Animal Cruelty campaign&quot;, in connection with bomb attacks against two of HLS&#x27;s clients in California. San Diego was added to the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists List in 2009.

==Convictions and legislation==

SHAC&#x27;s campaign prompted the introduction of sections 145–149 of the British Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, which created new offences intended to protect animal-testing facilities, including prohibiting acts or threats intended to cause someone to terminate or not enter into a contract with such a facility. The first person to be convicted under the Act was Joseph Harris, a doctor of molecular biology, who attacked property owned by companies supplying materials to HLS; he received a three-year sentence. In February 2007, a number of SHAC supporters were charged with illegal street collecting without a licence. According to the Metropolitan Police, two stalls in London&#x27;s Oxford Street collected over £80,000 a year. In March 2007, three activists were jailed under the Act for intimidating HLS suppliers; one supplier dropped its contract with HLS after being invaded by demonstrators wearing skull masks.

===2006: SHAC 7 (U.S.)===
In March 2006, a federal jury in Trenton, New Jersey, found six members of SHAC guilty of using their website to incite attacks on those who did business with HLS. Originally, seven individuals (the SHAC 7) were charged: Kevin Kjonaas (also known as Kevin Jonas, former president of Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA), Lauren Gazzola, Jacob Conroy, Joshua Harper, Andrew Stepanian, Darius Fullmer, and John McGee. McGee was later dropped from the case. They were charged with conspiracy to violate the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, in the first application of the 1992 statute. Jonas, Gazzola, Conroy, and Harper were charged with conspiracy to harass using a telecommunications device (discussing black faxes), while Jonas, Gazzola, Conroy, and SHAC USA were charged with stalking via the internet. The defence of the SHAC 7 rested largely on the 1969 case &quot;Brandenburg v. Ohio&quot;, in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that political speech is legal unless it can be shown that a defendant incited others to commit imminent unlawful acts of violence. During the trial, the defendants were prohibited from providing evidence of animal cruelty taking place at Huntingdon Life Sciences testing laboratories.

In 2011, NPR reported that Andrew Stepanian of the SHAC 7—since released—had been imprisoned in the highly restrictive Communication Management Unit of the U.S. federal prison system.

In 2019 Joaquin Phoenix produced &#x27;The Animal People&#x27;; a documentary about the SHAC 7 defendants.

===2007: Operation Achilles (UK)===
On 1 May 2007, a series of raids—Operation Achilles—took place against SHAC in Europe, involving 700 police officers in England, Amsterdam, and Belgium. Thirty-two people were arrested, including Greg and Natasha Avery, and Heather Nicholson, who were charged with blackmail, along with nine others.
Prosecutors told jurors that a 2007 meeting between the defendants had been bugged by police, and revealed that SHAC supported illegal acts that were traced to attacks on people across Great Britain. The prosecution also alleged there was evidence of direct email links between SHAC, the Animal Liberation Front, and Animal Rights Militia. &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; wrote that as a result of the police operation the number of attacks on HLS and associated businesses declined drastically, although the day after the convictions new posts on SHAC&#x27;s website indicated that the campaign would continue.
