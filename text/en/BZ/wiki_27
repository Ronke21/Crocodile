<text>In economics, the lump of labour fallacy is the misconception that there is a finite amount of work—a lump of labour—to be done within an economy which can be distributed to create more or fewer jobs. It is also known as the lump of jobs fallacy, fallacy of labour scarcity, fixed pie fallacy, and the zero-sum fallacy—due to its ties to zero-sum games. The term &quot;fixed pie fallacy&quot; is also used more generally to refer to the idea that there is a fixed amount of wealth in the world. This and other zero-sum fallacies can be caused by zero-sum bias.

It was considered a fallacy in 1891 by economist David Frederick Schloss, who held that the amount of work is not fixed. The term originated to rebut the idea that reducing the number of hours employees are allowed to labour during the working day would lead to a reduction in unemployment. The term is also commonly used to describe the false belief that increasing labour productivity, automation, immigration, or women&#x27;s participation in the workforce causes an increase in unemployment. The facts show that just like the amount of labor is not fixed, neither is the size of the economy (fixed pie fallacy) and as more work is done, the economy grows.
==Automation/Technological change==
While many workers fear that automation or artificial intelligence will take their jobs, history has shown that when jobs in some sectors disappear, jobs in new sectors are created. One example is the United States, where a century of increasing productivity and technological improvements changed the percentage of Americans employed in the production of food from 41% of the workforce in 1900 to 2% in 2000. This change did not result in large-scale unemployment, because workers found jobs in newly created industries (like farm equipment manufacturing). Another way to state this is that automation or technological improvements free workers to move to new growing industries.

==Immigration and women in the workforce==
While many people worry that new immigrants to their country will reduce employment (the same way US men in the 1960&#x27;s worried that women&#x27;s entry into the workforce would lead to massive unemployment) the data show that this did not happen because new workers earn money which they spend with the result being that the total economy grows and more people are employed.

== Early retirement ==
Early retirement has been used to induce workers to accept termination of employment before retirement age following the employer&#x27;s diminished labour needs.

In an editorial in &quot;The Economist&quot; a thought experiment is proposed in which old people leave the workforce in favour of young people, on whom they become dependent for their living through state benefits. It is then argued that since growth depends on having either more workers or greater productivity, the society cannot really become more prosperous by paying an increasing number of its citizens unproductively. The article also points out that even early retirees with private pension funds become a burden on society as they also depend on equity and bond income generated by workers.

== Criticism ==
There have been critiques of the idea that the concept is a fallacy. Arguments include that Schloss&#x27; concept is misapplied to working hours and that he was originally critiquing workers intentionally restricting their output, and that John Maynard Keynes believed shorter working hours could alleviate unemployment.

<doc id="732771" wikidata="Q5232737" url="?curid=732771" title="USS Vincennes (CL-64)">
<text>USS &quot;Vincennes&quot; was a light cruiser of the United States Navy, which were built during World War II. The class was designed as a development of the earlier s, the size of which had been limited by the First London Naval Treaty. The start of the war led to the dissolution of the treaty system, but the dramatic need for new vessels precluded a new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s used the same hull as their predecessors, but were significantly heavier. The &quot;Cleveland&quot;s carried a main battery of twelve guns in four three-gun turrets, along with a secondary armament of twelve  dual-purpose guns. They had a top speed of .

==Design==

The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers traced their origin to design work done in the late 1930s; at the time, light cruiser displacement was limited to by the Second London Naval Treaty. Following the start of World War II in September 1939, Britain announced it would suspend the treaty for the duration of the conflict, a decision the US Navy quickly followed. Though still neutral, the United States recognized that war was likely and the urgent need for additional ships ruled out an entirely new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s were a close development of the earlier s, the chief difference being the substitution of a two-gun dual-purpose gun mount for one of the main battery gun turrets.

&quot;Vincennes&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . Her crew numbered 1285 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 6 in /47-caliber Mark 16 guns in four 3-gun turrets on the centerline. Two were placed forward in a superfiring pair; the other two turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in another superfiring pair. The secondary battery consisted of twelve /38-caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin turrets. Two of these were placed on the centerline, one directly behind the forward main turrets and the other just forward of the aft turrets. Two more were placed abreast of the conning tower and the other pair on either side of the aft superstructure. Anti-aircraft defense consisted of twenty-four Bofors guns in four quadruple and four double mounts and twenty-one Oerlikon guns in single mounts.

The ship&#x27;s belt armor ranged in thickness from , with the thicker section amidships where it protected the ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. Her deck armor was thick. The main battery turrets were protected with faces and sides and tops, and they were supported by barbettes 6 inches thick. &quot;Vincennes&quot;″s conning tower had 5-inch sides.

==Construction and commissioning==
She was originally laid down as &quot;Flint&quot; (CL-64) on 7 March 1942 at Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation&#x27;s Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts. While the ship was under construction, however, the Battle of Savo Island occurred in August 1942, during which engagement the heavy cruiser &quot;Vincennes&quot; (CA-44) had been sunk. In order to perpetuate the name, &quot;Flint&quot; was renamed &quot;Vincennes&quot; on 16 October 1942. Launched on 17 July 1943, &quot;Vincennes&quot; was sponsored by Mrs. Arthur A. Osborn, the former Miss Harriet V. Kimmell, who had sponsored the first cruiser of the name.

Commissioned on 21 January 1944, Capt. Arthur D. Brown in command, &quot;Vincennes&quot; fitted-out at her builders&#x27; yard into late February, undergoing her sea trials soon thereafter. From 25 February to the last day of March, &quot;Vincennes&quot; sailed to the British West Indies and back on her shakedown cruise. With brief stopovers in the Chesapeake Bay region, the new light cruiser &quot;shook down&quot; principally in the Gulf of Paria, near Trinidad.

==Service==

===Post-shakedown and training===
After post-shakedown repairs and alterations, &quot;Vincennes&quot; became the flagship for Commander, Cruiser Division (CruDiv) 14, Rear Admiral Wilder D. Baker, who embarked in the light cruiser on 14 April with members of his staff. Other ships in the division included and — the latter perpetuating, like &quot;Vincennes&quot;, the name of a man-of-war lost earlier in action with Japanese surface units.

Departing Boston on 16 April, &quot;Vincennes&quot; subsequently transited the Panama Canal and ultimately reached Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, on 6 May. For the next week, the ship engaged in intensive training in the Hawaiian operating area. During one of the ship&#x27;s in-port periods that interspersed the at-sea training evolutions, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz came on board &quot;Vincennes&quot; and presented her embarked flag officer with a Navy Cross — won for directing bombardment operations in the Aleutians.

With the shakedown and training phases of her career behind her, the sleek light cruiser put to sea on 24 May and left Pearl Harbor in her wake. After conducting exercises &quot;en route&quot;, &quot;Vincennes&quot; reached Majuro, in the Marshall Islands, six days later. A week later, she left Majuro as part of the mighty armada known as Task Force 58 (TF 58). At the helm of that powerful striking force, based around the fast carriers of the Fleet, was Vice Admiral Marc A. Mitscher.

===Mariana Islands, 1944===
Subsequently, &quot;Vincennes&quot; made her initial contact with the enemy. During the first strikes on the Bonins, Japanese aircraft in retaliatory raids went after the TF 58 flattops. &quot;Vincennes&quot;, in the screen, downed a Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Betty&quot; bomber on 10 June. Her guns had drawn their first blood of the war. It would not be the last time.

In the days that ensued, &quot;Vincennes&quot; supported the carriers as they launched aircraft to smash Japanese positions on Saipan and Pagan Islands on 12–13 June. On the 16th, she was part of the group that conducted the first air strikes on Iwo Jima — an isle later to be remembered by many sailors and marines. During the key Battle of the Philippine Sea, &quot;Vincennes&quot;″ gunners performed their tasks well, aiding materially in the barrage of gunfire that broke up several of the enemy&#x27;s nevertheless persistent attacks.

On 23 June, Rear Admiral Baker shifted his flag to &quot;Vincennes&quot;″ sister ship &quot;Miami&quot;, releasing the erstwhile flagship to proceed to Eniwetok, in the Marshalls, for needed engineering repairs. Dropping anchor at Eniwetok on the 27th, &quot;Vincennes&quot; completed her repairs by the end of the month; she subsequently sailed to rejoin CruDiv 14, and Rear Admiral Baker brought his flag to the ship again on 7 July.

Departing Eniwetok on 14 July, &quot;Vincennes&quot; operated with TF 58 in the vicinity of Guam while the planes from the fast carriers conducted strikes on Japanese positions there from 18–21 July. She took part in further fast carrier task group strikes on Tinian, Rota, and Guam, through the 27th of the month. After continuing her support evolutions with the fast flattops, &quot;Vincennes&quot; headed for the Marianas, dropping her hook at Saipan on the last day of July.

Departing Saipan on 1 August, &quot;Vincennes&quot; resumed her operations with the carriers, making a high-speed run to the Bonins where planes from the carriers carried out air strikes on the 4th and 5th before retiring. The cruiser subsequently put into Eniwetok to replenish, anchoring there on the 11th, where Rear Admiral Francis E. M. Whiting relieved Admiral Baker eight days later, breaking his flag at &quot;Vincennes&#x27; &quot; main on that day.

Assigned next to TF 34, &quot;Vincennes&quot; departed Eniwetok at the end of August and conducted tactical and gunnery exercises until joining TG 38.2 on 3 September. Early that month, the task group conducted strikes on Japanese positions in the Palau Islands on 6 September. The next day, 7 September, &quot;Vincennes&quot;, as part of Task Unit 38.2.5 (TU 38.2.5), under Rear Admiral Whiting, embarked on board, conducted the first shore bombardment on Japanese installations on the southernmost Palau cluster of Peleliu, Ngesebus and Angaur islands, the ship&#x27;s captain subsequently recording that the coverage of the areas shelled was &quot;excellent&quot;.

===Philippines, 1944===
The operations against the Palaus, however, turned out to be only a curtain-raiser for the show to come — the recapture of the Philippines. &quot;Vincennes&quot; left the Palau group astern on 8 September for the southern Philippines. American carrier planes hit targets on the island of Mindanao on 9–10 September; the cruiser then screened the fast carriers as they conducted air strikes in the central Philippine Archipelago, hitting Negros, Leyte, Cebu, and the Bohol Islands from 12–14 September. &quot;Vincennes&quot; then proceeded to the operating areas off Luzon where carrier air strikes were launched against Japanese sites ashore on 21–22 September. The slate of air operations resumed again within a few days, &quot;Vincennes&quot; screening the flattops as their planes struck Leyte, Cebu, and Negros.

&quot;Vincennes&quot; left the operating areas soon thereafter, however, to replenish in the Carolines, reaching Ulithi on 1 October. Her stay in port was interrupted, however, by the presence of a typhoon in the vicinity. The light cruiser sortied for typhoon-evasion purposes on the 3rd, returning to port two days later. Resuming and completing the replenishment chores at Ulithi, &quot;Vincennes&quot; subsequently weighed anchor on 6 October with TF 38.

&quot;Vincennes&quot; operated off Okinawa in the ensuing days, reaching the waters off that isle on 10 October. Planes from the carriers in the task groups conducted the first air strikes in that area while the ships in the screen stood poised for retaliation from shore. Many enemy planes closed the carriers and their escorting battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and destroyer escorts — most to no avail. Friendly fighters on combat air patrol (CAP) duties overhead proved invaluable, knocking down many enemy aircraft that ventured too close. Included in the bag were a &quot;Betty&quot; and a Yokosuka P1Y &quot;Frances&quot;. The enemy knew no set time to attack — &quot;Vincennes&quot; observed a &quot;Betty&quot; being shot down within sight of the ship during the task force&#x27;s fueling-at-sea evolutions the next day.

===Formosa, 1944===
&quot;Vincennes&quot; and her sisters next shaped course for Formosa, as the fast carriers shifted their operating area to prepare the way for the upcoming onslaught against the Japanese-occupied Philippine Islands. &quot;En route&quot; to Formosa, Japanese planes frequently showed themselves, but maddeningly stayed out of range — persistent and pugnacious snoopers that always managed to slip away untouched.

On 12 October, the carriers began launching air strikes against Formosan sites; that afternoon, the task group gunners proved exceptional, downing a pair of &quot;Betties&quot; that ventured too close. &quot;Vincennes&quot; went to general quarters at 18:55 on that day and remained at battle stations almost continuously for the next two days. At 19:03, soon after the ship had manned her battle stations, &quot;Vincennes&quot; contributed to the flaming of two planes within 10 minutes — one at 19:03 and one at 19:10. The cruiser maintained a steady rate of fire throughout the air attack that continued intermittently until 20:45.

The strikes ceased at that point, but the respite provided the Americans proved only temporary — the determined Japanese came back again. Flares dropped from &quot;snoopers&quot; illuminated the entire task group, bathing the ships in an eerie light. Antiaircraft fire crisscrossed the night; one enemy plane tumbled in flames from the sky; &quot;Vincennes&quot; splashed another off her starboard quarter at 23:40.

The operations in the vicinity of Formosa proved dangerous, to say the least. The persistent Japanese attacks had taken their toll: the light cruiser &quot;Houston&quot; and the heavy cruiser had taken torpedoes and were badly damaged, limping out of the battle zone. To protect their flight, &quot;Cripple Division One&quot; was formed. Put together on 16 October, the force served its purpose; &quot;Vincennes&quot; participated in the withdrawal, screening her crippled sister-ship and division mate, and &quot;Canberra&quot;.

===Leyte Gulf===
&quot;Vincennes&quot; then operated in the vicinity of Visayas, in the Philippines, screening, as before, the fast carriers. Enemy snoopers closed the formation on several occasions; detected early on the 24th, a Japanese four-engined flying boat — a Kawanishi H8K &quot;Emily&quot; — went down in flames to the guns of friendly fighters.

Meanwhile, the Battle for Leyte Gulf was shaping up. At 03:25 on the 24th, &quot;Vincennes&quot; received reports of the presence of an enemy force. Four battleships, eight heavy cruisers, and 13 destroyers had been detected south of Buruncan Point, Mindanao Island. Enemy planes commenced a determined air attack; all ships in Vincennes&#x27; group maneuvered radically to avoid possible torpedoes.

At 02:30 on the 25th, two enemy task groups were reported about north of &quot;Vincennes&quot;″ formation. At 03:00, the light cruiser and her consorts headed north to engage; at 07:33, an intercepted report from a search plane told of many enemy surface ships about north and headed south at . Aircraft from the fast carriers launched and took off on the hunt, conducting persistent strikes on the Japanese ships that resulted in heavy enemy losses.

&quot;Vincennes&quot; subsequently headed south toward the San Bernardino Strait in anticipation of making contact with the enemy ships, including stragglers, that were expected to transit the strait in retiring from the day&#x27;s operations.

At 00:26, &quot;Vincennes&quot;″ radar plot disclosed a surface contact at a distance of . &quot;Vincennes&quot;, and Miami escorted by DesDiv 103, broke from the formation to attack. At 00:54, gun-flashes from &quot;Vincennes&quot; and her sisters&#x27; main battery split the night; both main and secondary batteries — 6 and 5-inch guns — in company with the 5-inch guns of the destroyers, hurled salvoes at the enemy vessel. The vessel — tentatively identified as a cruiser — sank beneath the waves at 01:49 as a result of the deluge of rapid shellfire. Their victim was actually the &quot;Nowaki&quot;.

&quot;Vincennes&quot; returned to former cruising grounds off Visayas on 28 October and off Luzon the following day. The ship experienced several determined air attacks on the 29th, but the CAP proved ready to accept the enemy&#x27;s challenges, downing eight Japanese planes during the course of the raids.

&quot;Vincennes&quot; continued her vital screening duties on 5–6 November as carrier planes carried out strikes on Japanese positions and installations on Luzon. She then headed for the Carolines, reaching Ulithi on 9 November and dropping anchor. Replenishment completed, she stood out five days later to return to the combat zone in the Philippines.

By the time she returned, air strikes against Japanese positions on Luzon were well underway; enemy resistance — now taking on a fiercer aspect with more widespread use of the &quot;kamikaze&quot;, proved heavy once more, several persistent air attacks occurring on the ships with which &quot;Vincennes&quot; was operating. , and all took &quot;kamikazes&quot;. &quot;Vincennes&quot; blasted a second kamikaze heading for &quot;Cabot&quot;; others that managed to get by the CAP were taken under fire as well.

Subsequently, &quot;Vincennes&quot; returned to Ulithi for further replenishment and conducted exercises en route back to the battle zones. &quot;Vincennes&quot; then operated in support of carrier air strikes on Luzon from 14–16 December; during that time, &quot;Vincennes&quot;″ senior aviator, Lt. Halbert K. Evans, led a rescue mission of cruiser-based floatplanes and performed such sterling service that he was later awarded the Air Medal.

Neptune&#x27;s fury soon interrupted the unfolding pressure against the Japanese, however, when Typhoon Cobra swirled through the fleet on the 18th. The severe tropical storm generated gusts of wind up to , whipping up mountainous seas. Fortunately for &quot;Vincennes&quot;, she was able to weather the storm without serious damage. After the storm had subsided, all available ships searched for the survivors of the three destroyers, , , and , which had tragically capsized in the typhoon.

===Further operations off of Formosa, 1945===
After a Christmas respite at Ulithi from 24–30 December, &quot;Vincennes&quot; returned to the waters off Formosa, again screening the flattops. She subsequently entered the South China Sea in early January, encountering only two small enemy raids; night fighters (&quot;friendlies&quot;) downed two enemy planes early on the morning of 10 January 1945.

Assigned areas east of Cam Ranh Bay, Indochina, the task group to which &quot;Vincennes&quot; was attached conducted air strikes on shipping in that vicinity before proceeding west of Formosa for further strikes on that already-pounded isle, as well as the coast of China. Enemy air resistance, as before, proved heavy.

During subsequent attacks on Formosa, Japanese planes struck back. One pushed over into a steep dive shortly after noon on 21 January; as she screamed down at her target, &quot;Vincennes&quot; commenced firing at her. At 12:09, the determined &quot;kamikaze&quot; plunged into . Fires soon broke out; the carrier began trailing a tell-tale plume of black smoke. She had been hit hard.

While ships rushed to &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;″s aid, the formation resumed a lookout for the determined Japanese. At 12:46, &quot;Vincennes&quot; fired on enemy aircraft in the vicinity; three minutes later, the light cruiser teamed with &quot;Miami&quot; to blast a &quot;kamikaze&quot; from the sky and into the sea. The barrage of anti-aircraft fire, however, could not stop a second suicider which plunged into &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; at 12:55.

After supporting strikes against Japanese positions on Okinawa, &quot;Vincennes&quot; returned to Ultihi for replenishment, reaching that place of rest on 26 January. Leaving the Carolines in her wake subsequently, the light cruiser departed Ulithi on 10 February, joining TG 58.1 that evening. During scheduled gunnery exercises, a radio control target drone crashed into the splinter shield of one of &quot;Vincennes&quot;″ 40 mm mounts, bursting into flame. With utter disregard for their own safety, four sailors, Chief Boatswain&#x27;s Mate Mack C. Miller, USN; Gunner&#x27;s Mate 3d Class Carl C. Miller, USNR; Gunner&#x27;s Mate 3d Class Buck E. Goebel, USNR; and Seaman 1st Class Paul G. Catarius, USNR, entered the mount and threw smoldering debris, as well as damaged and overheated ammunition over the side, thus preventing further damage. For their meritorious conduct, each man received commendation ribbons subsequently.

===Operations off Japan &amp; Okinawa, 1945===
Repairing the superficial damage in the wake of the drone accident, &quot;Vincennes&quot; continued with TG 58.1 as it headed toward the Japanese home islands. Operating southeast of Honshū, the fast carriers conducted strikes on the Tokyo area and the southern Bonin Islands. The first carrier strikes conducted by the fast carrier planes hit Tokyo on the 16th; strikes that continued the following day, stepping up the pace of the war and carrying it to the Empire&#x27;s veritable doorstep.

Over the days that ensued, carrier planes hit not only targets in Japan but on Chichi Jima, hitting Japanese airfields. More strikes against Tokyo itself took place on 25 February.

Four days later, the carriers launched their planes to hit Okinawa. On 1 March, &quot;Vincennes&quot;, &quot;Miami&quot;, , and DesRon 61, with Rear Admiral Whiting in &quot;Vincennes&quot; as unit commander, sailed for Okino Daito Shima and shelled Japanese installations there starting large fires ashore. For directing the successful bombardment mission, Rear Admiral Whiting was awarded the Bronze Star.

The following fortnight for &quot;Vincennes&quot; was spent primarily in operational training and replenishment away from the forward operating areas. Complete release from combat tensions was not enjoyed, however, for &quot;kamikazes&quot; struck Ulithi on 11 March, one crashing into the new carrier only three miles distant, and another crashing ashore.

Returning to the battle zone within a week&#x27;s time, &quot;Vincennes&quot; steamed with TG 58.1 as it headed for Kyūshū. After American carrier-based planes had hit Japanese installations on Kyūshū, determined enemy attacks on the formation kept &quot;Vincennes&quot;″ gunnery department busy on the 18th. A twin-engined bomber flew over the ship at 05:06 on that day, at an altitude of . The ship&#x27;s gunfire scored hits on that enemy aircraft, as well as another one that crashed into the sea astern, just 20 minutes later. At 06:01, &quot;Vincennes&quot;″ gunners scored again, splashing a Japanese plane close to .

Firing at enemy aircraft continued at intervals throughout the balance of 18–19 March, with &quot;Vincennes&quot; contributing an outstanding performance; her antiaircraft fire control officer, 1st Lieutenant Henry M. Lamberton, USMCR, received a Bronze Star for his direction of that battery.

&quot;Vincennes&quot; operated east of Okinawa from 23–25 March, while carriers in TG 58.1 sent off their planes to conduct air strikes against the Japanese on Okinawa. Two days later, the ship resumed operations east and southeast of the island earmarked for invasion and continued such operations through 5 April. On 31 March, two of &quot;Vincennes&quot;″ floatplanes cooperated in rescuing a downed fighter pilot in spite of heavy enemy fire; Lt. Evans, commended earlier, received the Distinguished Flying Cross, while Lt. (jg.) George A. Greenwood, USNR, and the two rear-seat men all received Air Medals.

On 1 April, the day of the initial assault on Okinawa, enemy air attacks came thick and fast. Ships of TG 58.1 smashed 12 enemy planes into the sea; &quot;Vincennes&quot; drew three assists in the action. At 13:21, the ship experienced her narrowest escape in the war; an enemy aircraft, hit by the ship&#x27;s gunfire, crashed only astern.

Subsequently, &quot;Vincennes&quot; operated in various groups of TF 58 off Okinawa, supporting the fast carriers as they hit Okinawa and Kyūshū. Frequent and persistent air attacks characterized the three weeks commencing on 7 April, while the invasion of Okinawa proceeded apace. CAP fighters shot down many of the attackers, but sometimes the attacks came in such force that ships in the formation would have to lay down barrages of antiaircraft fire to greet the enemy aircraft that had fought their way through the friendly fighters.

After another replenishment period at Ulithi, &quot;Vincennes&quot; rejoined the forces off Okinawa, remaining with TG 58.1. The light cruiser performed screening duties for the fast carriers as they hit Kyūshū before being ordered to report for duty with the shore bombardment forces off Okinawa on 17 May. In company with sister-ship , &quot;Vincennes&quot; complied and, for 27 of the next 30 days, shelled Japanese targets ashore, both day and night.

&quot;Vincennes&quot;″ 6 in guns fired 5,836 rounds; her batteries contributed another 10,583 rounds to the shellings. Air spotters and shore fire control spotters recorded the effectiveness of the ship&#x27;s fire in their subsequent reports: she destroyed a large &quot;disappearing coastal gun&quot; and concentrations of troops; direct hits were scored on mortar positions; destroyed nine gun emplacements; destroyed an ammunition dump with a direct hit; destroyed coastal batteries; and closed off the entrances to at least five caves. Her airmen proved a busy lot, Lt. Evans earning a gold star in lieu of his second DFC and Lt. (jg.) Greenwood earning a DFC; each man flew 10 spotting missions.

===End of the war &amp; post-war===
&quot;Vincennes&quot; fired her final salvoes on 16 June and then headed for the United States for a much-needed overhaul. Sailing via Pearl Harbor, Vincennes reached Mare Island Navy Yard on 8 July and remained there until the availability was completed in late August.

During that time, the war in the Pacific had drawn to a close with a battered but defiant Japan surrendering in mid-August. After her post-repair trials, &quot;Vincennes&quot; had shifted to San Diego on 29 August to commence her post-repair shakedown and refresher training in the waters off San Clemente Island.

&quot;Vincennes&quot; then participated in Operation Magic Carpet following her refresher training, sailing between Pearl Harbor and the west coast as a transport for returning sailors and Marines. She continued her &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; assignment by sailing for the South Pacific that autumn, reaching Noumea, New Caledonia, to become the flagship for Rear Admiral Paul Hendren, Commander, South Pacific Area Force. On 25 October, the ship got underway to take Rear Admiral Hendren on an inspection tour of facilities at Guadalcanal; in the Russells; at Tulagi; at Espiritu Santo; and Efate, returning to Nouméa on 5 November. During the course of that brief voyage, the ship passed near the spot where her namesake had gone down that furious night of combat on 8 and 9 August 1942 in the Battle of Savo Island.

&quot;Vincennes&quot; subsequently made two trips to New Zealand waters before returning home with 300 veterans embarked as passengers. Discharging them at San Francisco upon her arrival on 23 March 1946, the light cruiser sped to Mare Island where workmen soon commenced deactivating the ship.

==Decommissioning==
Decommissioned on 10 September 1946, &quot;Vincennes&quot; never returned to active service with the Fleet. She was one of the &quot;Cleveland class&quot; ships surveyed for conversion to guided missile configuration like her sisters &quot;Little Rock&quot; and &quot;Providence&quot;, but other ships were selected instead. Struck from the Navy list on 1 April 1966, she was sunk as a target in missile experiments in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California near Point Mugu, on 28 October 1969.

==Awards ==
&quot;Vincennes&quot; earned six battle stars for her World War II service.

<text>Bernt Haas (; born 8 April 1978) is a former Swiss football defender. He was most recently sporting director of Grasshopper Club Zürich.

==Career==
===Club===
Haas was born in Vienna, Austria. He played his early youth football with local club FC Freienbach before he moved to the youth department of Grasshoppers Zurich. Aged just 16 years he signed his first professional contract and advanced from the U-21 team to GC first team under head coach Christian Gross during the 1994–95 Nationalliga A season. Haas played his debut on 31 May 1995 as GC won an away game 3–1 against Lausanne-Sport. At the end of the season he won the Swiss Championship. Haas play his Champions League debut on 1 November 1995 as GC played a goalless draw against Ajax.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uefa-CL-1995/96-GC-Ajax&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Haas played with GC for seven seasons before moving to England to join Premier League club Sunderland in August 2001. Despite making 27 appearances for the club in 2001–02, he did not play for Sunderland during the following season and was loaned out to FC Basel.

On 30 August 2002 it was announced that Haas had joined Basel&#x27;s first team during their 2002–03 season under head coach Christian Gross, who in the meantime had moved on. Haas played his domestic league debut for the club in the home game in the St. Jakob-Park on 11 September 2002 as Basel won 7–1 against Wil. Basel advanced to the group stage and they ended this in second position behind Valencia, but ahead of Liverpool and Spartak Moscow to advance to the second group stage. They ended this in third position behind Manchester United and Juventus, but ahead of Deportivo La Coruña. Haas scored his first goal for the club on 8 March 2003 in the home game as Basel won 2–0 against Servette.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcb-achiv-2002/03-F-FCBServette&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although Basel had a buy out option in the loan contract, Hass decided he wanted to return to England. During his 10 months with the club he played a total of 43 games for Basel scoring that one goal. 22 of these games were in the Swiss Super League, four in the Swiss Cup, 11 in the Champions League and six were friendly games.

Haas joined West Bromwich Albion in 2003, and was a regular at right-back as Albion were promoted back to the Premier League. He scored with a superb volley in the 2–0 League Cup win against Manchester United, having already scored in an earlier round against Brentford. He also scored once in the league against Crewe. However, he found his chances limited in the top-flight, and left the club by mutual consent on 21 January 2005. The following day he signed for SC Bastia in France, whom he played for prior to joining 1. FC Köln. 

After just one season at Cologne, he joined Swiss Super League club FC St. Gallen in 2007. But injuries obstructed his progress. The career of the strong right-back ended in some doctor&#x27;s room in St. Gallen. Cartilage damage and osteoarthritis in the knee.

===International===
Haas played for the Swiss national team at Euro 2004 and was sent off in the match against England.

==Post-retirement==
Following his retirement in 2010, Haas decided to go self-employed and became a player consultant. He functioned as director of football for Liechtensteiner club FC Vaduz from 2015 until 2018. He remained living in Wollerau and commuted the 40 minutes by car to the Principality.

Between 2020 and 2022, he functioned as Sporting Director at Swiss Challenge League side FC Schaffhausen. On 7 September 2023, he was fined 2,000 for his role in Schaffhausen fielding ineligible players during the 2021–22 season. That season&#x27;s top scorer Joaquín Ardaiz and his fellow Uruguayan Agustín González had made appearances in 21 games without a valid work permit. 

On 1 July 2022 he was appointed Sporting Director of his former club Grasshopper Club Zürich. He was dismissed from this position on 27 March 2024.

==Personal life==
He has a twin sister named Dina, once a talented sports photographer and well known in the football business.

Haas once worked as a model for Armani.

<doc id="732780" wikidata="Q2334495" url="?curid=732780" title="Tony Hawk's Underground">
<text>Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground is a 2003 skateboarding video game and the fifth entry in the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; series, following &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4&quot;. It was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Game Boy Advance. In 2004, it was published for Windows in Australia and New Zealand as a budget release.

&quot;Underground&quot; is built upon the skateboarding formula of previous &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; games: the player explores levels and completes goals while performing tricks. It features a new focus on customization; the player, instead of selecting a professional skater, creates a custom character. &quot;Underground&quot; adds the ability for players to dismount their boards and explore on foot. The plot follows the player character and their friend Eric Sparrow as the two become professionals and grow apart.

&quot;Underground&quot; was developed with a theme of individuality which was manifested in the extensive character customization options, the presence of a narrative, and the product&#x27;s characterization as an adventure game. Real world professional skateboarders contributed their experiences to the plot. &quot;Underground&quot; was a major critical and commercial success, with reviewers praising its wide appeal, soundtrack, customization, multiplayer, and storyline. The graphics and the controls for driving vehicles and walking were less well received. &quot;Underground&quot;″s PlayStation 2 version had sold 2.11 million copies in the United States by December 2007. A sequel, &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground 2&quot;, followed in 2004.

== Gameplay ==

Like its predecessors in the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; series, &quot;Underground&quot; is centered on skateboarding in a series of levels. The player performs tricks via combinations of analog stick and button inputs. For example, the player initiates an ollie (a jump trick) by holding and releasing the jump button. During an ollie, the player may change the position of the analog stick and press one of two buttons to perform either a flip trick (such as an impossible or kickflip) or a grab trick (such as a benihana or nosegrab). The player can grind on certain edges and rails; different tricks may be performed during a grind based on the position of the analog stick. On quarter pipes, the player may execute lip tricks. While skating on flat surfaces, the player may manual in multiple ways via button combinations. Miscellaneous tricks include acid drops and wall-rides.

While a grind, lip, or manual trick is underway, a balance meter appears: unless the player prevents this meter from falling to the left or right, the character will bail and need a few seconds to recover. Bailing can also be caused by falling without one&#x27;s board facing downward. Completing tricks in succession without bailing is called a combo. Comboing raises the player&#x27;s score and fills up the Special Meter; when it is full, the player is granted access to more elaborate tricks worth more points, such as the McTwist and 540 Flip. &quot;Underground&quot; introduces the ability to dismount one&#x27;s skateboard, which allows the player to explore levels more carefully and reach new areas. Each level features at least one vehicle, usually a car, that the player can drive.

The levels are based on regions of the United States and other countries. In each level, certain tasks that advance the narrative must be completed before the player can move on. These tasks include score attacks, races, item collection, and reaching one of many gaps found in a level. Each level houses one professional skateboarder, who provides a sidequest that unlocks a trick for the Special Meter. On account of the levels&#x27; large sizes and the integration of goals into the story, &quot;Underground&quot; has been described as an adventure game. Characters can level up their stats—which include jump height and speed—by completing optional goals in a level; this adds an element of role-playing gameplay. Other gameplay modes include multiplayer minigames—one, a combat mode called &quot;Firefight&quot;, can be played online in the PlayStation 2 version—and a &quot;free skate&quot; mode that lets the player explore levels with no goals or story.

&quot;Underground&quot; features extensive customization. The player creates a custom character for the story mode, and may not play as a pre-made professional skater outside a few contexts: a special scene late in the game, minigames, and the free skate mode. A level editor allows the player to create skate parks with a large array of objects, ranging from traditional skate park elements like halfpipes, ramps, funboxes, and grind rails to more outlandish pieces like buildings and sections of elevated freeways. The player can change their park&#x27;s time of day and environmental theme. Tricks, skateboards, and level goals may be customized as well.

&quot;Underground&quot; features many real world professional skateboarders including: Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Paul Rodriguez, Chad Muska, Mike Vallely, Andrew Reynolds, and Stacy Peralta. &quot;Underground&quot; also features cameo appearances by Iron Man, a parody of C.H.U.D. called T.H.U.D., and Kiss bassist Gene Simmons.

While the console versions are fully three-dimensional, the Game Boy Advance version is rendered in an isometric style that incorporates both 2D sprites and 3D models. This version is a more traditional &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; game, with little attention given to the story or customization. The mobile version is similarly restricted.

== Plot ==
The protagonist and their friend, Eric Sparrow, live in suburban New Jersey and dream of becoming famous skateboarders. The protagonist manages to impress professional skater Chad Muska, visiting town for a demo, who gives them a new skateboard and informs them that a good way to start a skating career is to gain a sponsorship from a local skate shop. The protagonist seeks out Stacy Peralta, who agrees to sponsor them on the condition that the player does something to set themselves apart from the other local skaters, so the protagonist travels to Manhattan, New York with Eric, who is on the run from drug dealers after setting their car on fire as revenge for stealing from the skate shop.

There, the pair shoot a skating video that impresses Stacy, who loans them a van and suggests they enter the Tampa AM, an amateur division skate contest held annually at the Skatepark of Tampa, in Tampa, Florida. Upon arrival, Eric is arrested for insulting a police officer, and the protagonist does favors for the local police department to secure his bail. However, when they arrive for the contest, it is revealed that Eric had only completed his own application form and not the protagonist&#x27;s, forcing a dejected protagonist to try and impress competitors in the pro contest in order to gain admission. After impressing Tony Hawk, the protagonist wins the Best Trick event at Tampa AM and is offered deals by major skateboard sponsors, much to Eric&#x27;s dismay. The protagonist then heads to San Diego, California to meet Todd, the manager of the team, and completes several photo shoots for a magazine. Following a wild celebration party, it is revealed that Eric has been picked up by the same sponsor.

The team then flies out to Hawaii to film a video, with the protagonist aiming for local spots that skaters have not filmed at before. Finding a tall hotel, the protagonist climbs to the roof and recruits Eric to film a trick video atop it. The police arrive to arrest them for trespassing, but the protagonist uses the opportunity to perform a McTwist over the helicopter and onto the awning of the adjacent Royal Hawaiian Hotel, allowing them and an awestruck Eric to evade the police. The team then travels to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. After doing errands for locals and finishing their part of the team video, the protagonist attends the video premiere at the Slam City Jam. Eric steals the idea and edits the protagonist&#x27;s part out of the video, allowing only Eric to become a professional. After angrily confronting Eric, the protagonist enters Eric&#x27;s pro contest and wins, becoming a pro as well.

After designing their own pro skateboard, the protagonist and Eric embark on a team trip to Moscow, Russia, where they reconcile. Eric gets drunk and joyrides in a Russian military tank. The protagonist hops in and attempts to stop the tank but, being unfamiliar with the controls, fails to stop it from crashing into a government building. Eric jumps out and runs away, leaving the protagonist, trapped inside, to be arrested by the Russian military. Eric then lies and claims the protagonist stole the tank, stating that he in fact tried to stop them. Unwilling to pay the $700,000 worth of damages, Todd kicks the protagonist off the team, much to Eric&#x27;s delight. The American Embassy bails out the protagonist, leaving them to do favors for locals in order to return home to New Jersey.

Eric, who now owns his own skate company, reveals that he had been planning to betray the protagonist after having long abandoned the idea of &quot;soul skating&quot; (skating for enjoyment rather than riches); after unsuccessfully trying to exempt them from the Tampa AM, Eric stole the helicopter footage in jealousy before finally getting the protagonist kicked off the skate team by lying back in Moscow. Determined to fight back, the protagonist teams up with Peralta and several professionals to create a soul skating video, creating a new trick in the process. Due to the success of the video, Eric challenges the protagonist to one last skate-off, with the unedited helicopter tape at stake. The protagonist wins the skate-off and walks away with the tape while Eric screams at them.

=== Alternate ending ===
If the story has been completed more than once on two different difficulties, an alternate ending occurs, where the protagonist knocks Eric unconscious, taking the tape back instead of holding the skate-off.

== Development ==
=== Concept ===
The GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox versions of &quot;Underground&quot; were developed by Neversoft, while the Game Boy Advance version was developed by Vicarious Visions the mobile version by Jamdat, and the Windows version was created by Beenox. Activision, which had acquired Neversoft in 1999, published all the versions. &quot;Underground&quot; was conceived as the fifth entry in the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot; series under the title &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 5&quot; (no relation to the 2015 game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 5&quot;), but it was reworked.

&quot;Underground&quot; was created with a theme of individuality: it stars an amateur skater in a true story mode, whereas each previous &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; game had starred professional skaters and had lacked a plot. One reason for only allowing the player to use a custom character was that certain criminal acts completed in the plot would not reflect well on real-world skaters. Previous games in the series had included character-creation features as well, but Neversoft expanded customization in &quot;Underground&quot; by implementing face-scanning for the PlayStation 2 version: if the player emailed a photograph of their face to &quot;faces@thugonline.com&quot;, the company could digitize it for use in the game. Regarding the customization options, especially the park editor, producer Stacey Drellishak said that Neversoft was &quot;trying to create the most customizable game ever&quot;. The developers used storytelling and exploration to distance their product from the plotless, task-based format of previous &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; games, which led Neversoft president Joel Jewett to describe &quot;Underground&quot; as an adventure game.

=== Design ===
Levels in the console versions of &quot;Underground&quot; were significantly larger than those of earlier &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; games. Neversoft expanded each level until it ceased to run correctly, then shrunk it slightly. Most of the levels were modelled closely after real-world locations; the designers traveled to locales representative of each city and took photographs and videos as reference. The New Jersey level was a replication of a neighborhood where team artist Henry Ji had grown up as a young skater. Neversoft wanted the player to become familiar with the basic game mechanics quickly and to notice &quot;Underground&quot;″s differences from previous &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; games immediately. To accomplish this, they introduced the ability to travel on foot, and the ability to climb along ledges in the first few missions. While Neversoft wanted to keep &quot;Underground&quot; realistic and relatable for the most part, they added driving side-missions as an enjoyable diversion and to push the boundaries of freedom in skateboarding games, but these missions were not intended to take away from the main experience of skateboarding.

&quot;Pro Skater 4&quot;, &quot;Underground&quot;″s predecessor in the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; series, had received criticism for its difficulty: Neversoft had not realized that each game in the series was drawing new fans who were unaccustomed to the demanding tasks. As a result, Neversoft added four difficulty settings to &quot;Underground&quot;″s story mode, ranging from &quot;Too Easy&quot; to &quot;Sick&quot;. Neversoft wanted players to develop skills for higher difficulty settings on Too Easy while still progressing through the story. The company had included extremely difficult missions in each previous &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; game; the methods used to create these missions were the inspiration for &quot;Underground&quot;″s Sick mode. Development of the basic gameplay mechanics and structure began quickly but by the end of August 2003, only two months before the American release, work was still in progress.

While the cutscenes are animated with 3D graphics, the team recorded live-action videos to introduce the real-world skateboarding teams, so that players could better understand each team before selecting one to join. Neversoft interviewed professional skaters about their experiences of becoming known in the skateboarding world, then compiled elements of these stories into the script. Every skater who appears in the plot helped to craft their own scenes and voiced their own character.

=== Promotion and release ===
&quot;Underground&quot; was promoted with a playable demo at Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;GameRiot&quot; event held at Lollapalooza in July 2003. Activision promoted &quot;Underground&quot; with the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Face Off Mobile Tour&quot;, a series of events across 29 cities in October. Attendees could play the game early and compete in it for tickets to Boom Boom Huck Jam 2003, which Tony Hawk himself attended. Activision, which sponsored the October Gravity Games extreme sports competition, promoted the game at the event and used its rendering engine to model tricks performed by the real-world skaters. The console and Game Boy Advance versions were released on October 28 in the United States, November 14 in Europe, and May 2004 in Japan. The mobile phone version was released worldwide in January 2004. This version was distributed in the United States via AT&amp;T&#x27;s mMode data download service and also by Verizon Wireless. &quot;Underground&quot; had a marketing budget of $8.6 million.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot; received &quot;universal acclaim&quot;, according to review aggregator Metacritic. GameZone&#x27;s Michael Knutson wrote that &quot;Underground&quot; is &quot;one of the best skating games around&quot; and that players of every skill level would enjoy it. Eurogamer&#x27;s Tom Bramwell concurred that &quot;as a &#x27;pick-up-and-play&#x27; sort of game, &quot;THUG&quot; is endlessly rewarding&quot; and called it the best entry in the series.

The story was well received. Joe Rybicki of &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; said that, as an extreme-sports game, &quot;Underground&quot; has a real story with &quot;honest-to-goodness characters&quot;. IGN&#x27;s Douglas Perry called it &quot;a kick, albeit relatively lightweight in nature&quot;. He especially praised the pervasive sense of humor in the narrative and in the portrayal of real-world skaters. Knutson called the story &quot;unique&quot; and said that it blends well with the gameplay. Ben Silverman of Game Revolution described the plot as a &quot;silly&quot; cross between those of the 1980s films &quot;North Shore&quot; and &quot;Gleaming the Cube&quot;, but he praised it for giving context to the level goals and keeping distance between the skill unlocks. Bramwell called it &quot;hackneyed&quot;. Rybicki found that the plot hurt the replay value and caused missions to be overly simplistic. By contrast, &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Justin Leeper thought that &quot;it serves to make some of the less-entertaining goals tolerable, because there&#x27;s a reason for doing them&quot;.

The aesthetics were generally well received. Bramwell called the graphics &quot;unchanged and increasingly antiquated&quot; and criticized the presence of &quot;sharp, angular character models, eerily unrealistic lighting and odd little moments when the player is trying to turn round and ends up banging into a curb&quot;. Knutson, meanwhile, was positive regarding the graphics, art, and animation: he called them &quot;nearly flawless&quot; and praised the realism they brought to the inherently fantastical skateboarding genre. Williams said that &quot;&quot;THUG&quot;″s cityscapes are incredibly well designed&quot; and singled out the GameCube version of &quot;Underground&quot; as exceptionally well rendered. Rybicki called the levels &quot;big and beautiful&quot;. Knutson commended the soundtrack&#x27;s large size and the sound effects&#x27; realism. Perry appreciated the &quot;hilariously hurtful&quot; injury sounds and the extensive song list. By contrast, IGN&#x27;s Craig Harris praised the graphics of the Game Boy Advance version but was more mixed on the soundtrack.

The alternate gameplay modes were received well. Knutson lauded the high degree of customization; he summarized that &quot;everything is expounded a hundred fold: from create-a-skater to create-a-park mode, it is simply amazing&quot;. He singled out the level editor as one of the deepest he had ever seen. GameSpy&#x27;s Bryn Williams identified the level editor as an &quot;extremely well-designed&quot; feature that contributed to the overall &quot;brilliance&quot; of the full product. Leeper said that each customization mode is &quot;intuitive and user-friendly&quot;, and both he and Rybicki especially enjoyed the trick-creation feature. Reviewers for &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine praised the story mode, whose open world format they compared to the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series. Knutson and Perry enjoyed the multiplayer, particularly the online Firefight mode. Williams thought similarly and stated that &quot;the most notable disappointment&quot; was the lack of online play for non-PlayStation 2 owners. Harris found the board customization of the Game Boy Advance version to be poorly implemented, though in-depth. Despite his praise for the customization modes, Leeper admitted that his greatest enjoyment still came from &quot;seeking great lines&quot; and beating own scores.

The walking and driving controls were criticized. Bramwell claimed that these modes felt &quot;like they&#x27;ve been attached with an old stick of glue that&#x27;s about as adhesive as baby oil&quot;. Knutson agreed, though he praised the novelty of these diversions. He stated that &quot;the &quot;Tony Hawk&quot; series has always had exceptional controls&quot; and that &quot;Underground&quot;, overall, was no exception. Perry felt that the feature increased levels&#x27; replay value. Similarly, &quot;Famitsu&quot; reviewers noted that, although the fast pace was extremely challenging at times, the high difficulty provides a sense of accomplishment when jumps and tricks are performed correctly. Williams found the GameCube version&#x27;s controls mediocre, albeit manageable. Damon Brown from GameSpot said that the mobile version&#x27;s restrictive controls—many tricks require three button inputs—were that version&#x27;s only caveat.

=== Sales and accolades ===
&quot;Underground&quot; won Best Sports Game at the 2003 Game Critics Awards hosted by Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). The 2004 MTV Video Music Awards introduced a new category, Best Video Game Soundtrack, which &quot;Underground&quot; won. During the AIAS&#x27; 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Underground&quot; received nominations for Console Action Sports Game of the Year, Outstanding Achievement in Game Design, and Outstanding Achievement in Licensed Soundtrack.

In Europe the week after the release, the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube versions were respectively the fifth, sixth, and eighth-best selling games for those consoles. It would remain uninterrupted in the top twenty of every week until January 24, 2004, for the Xbox and GameCube and February 21 for the PlayStation 2, inclusive. As of December 2007, the PlayStation 2 version had sold 2.11 million copies in the United States. The GameCube version made Nintendo&#x27;s Player&#x27;s Choice list by selling 250,000 copies in the United States. Its PlayStation 2 version also received a &quot;Platinum&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

== Sequel ==

Neversoft and Activision released a sequel, &quot;Underground 2&quot;, on October 4, 2004, for Windows, GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, Game Boy Advance, and PlayStation Portable consoles. The plot continues that of &quot;Underground&quot; and focuses on the player character and their team sabotaging an opposing team. The gameplay, structure, and level design are very similar to those of &quot;Underground&quot;, but &quot;Underground 2&quot; features new tricks and gameplay mechanics, like the Natas spin, the ability to plant customized stickers in levels with the &quot;sticker slap&quot;, a slow-motion &quot;Focus&quot; mode, and the ability to earn points by having a tantrum after falling. The plot is set in new locations, including Boston, New Orleans, Berlin, Barcelona, and Skatopia.

<doc id="732786" wikidata="Q706058" url="?curid=732786" title="Allan Clarke (footballer)">
<text>Allan John Clarke (born 31 July 1946), nicknamed &quot;Sniffer&quot;, is a former professional footballer who played in the Football League for Walsall, Fulham, Leicester City, Leeds United and Barnsley, and won 19 international caps for England.

==Career==

===Early career===
Clarke was born in Short Heath, Willenhall, Staffordshire. He is the third of seven children. Clarke joined Walsall F.C. in 1961 as an apprentice, playing his debut for the Saddlers in October 1963, against Reading. Whilst at the club he scored 46 goals in 82 appearances. He was transferred to Fulham in March 1966 for a fee of £35,000. Such was his early promise that Leicester City paid £150,000 for Clarke in 1968, a then British football transfer fee record. Frank Large moved to Fulham from Leicester as part of the deal. Clarke spent just one season at Leicester City, in which he scored the winning goal in the semi-final of the 1969 FA Cup, knocking out the team he had supported as a boy – West Bromwich Albion. He also played in the FA Cup final and was man of the match, despite Leicester City losing 1–0 to Manchester City.

===Leeds United===
On 24 June 1969, Leeds United manager Don Revie paid £165,000 to Leicester City for Clarke&#x27;s services. For the second time, Clarke had topped the British football transfer fee record.

Clarke scored 26 goals in his first season at Leeds and earned the nickname &quot;Sniffer&quot;, because of his predatory instincts of &quot;sniffing out&quot; scoring opportunities. Leeds United chased a dream &quot;treble&quot; of League championship, FA Cup and European Cup though ultimately they won nothing. Clarke hit the post in the FA Cup Final at Wembley (with strike partner Mick Jones following up to score the rebound) and then went on a run through several Chelsea defenders in the replay to set up a goal for Jones again, but Leeds United still lost. The title had already gone to Everton who had clinched the trophy several weeks before the end of the season, and the European Cup campaign ended with defeat to Celtic in the semi-final (0–1 at Elland Road and 1–2 at Hampden Park).

Clarke was in the Leeds United side that won its second Fairs Cup in 1971, scoring in the final against Juventus. Leeds United reached the FA Cup Final again in the competition&#x27;s centenary year, and at Wembley they faced the Cup holders, Arsenal. Clarke scored the only goal of the game with a diving header from a Jones cross early in the second half. He had hit the crossbar with another diving header earlier in the game. Unfortunately for Clarke and Leeds, they lost the League title and the chance of emulating Arsenal&#x27;s previous season &quot;double&quot; when they lost to Wolverhampton Wanderers two days after winning the FA Cup.
Clarke played again at Wembley – and lost – when Leeds United were beaten 1–0 by Sunderland in the 1973 FA Cup Final. Clarke was again Leeds United&#x27;s top scorer as Leeds United won the league title in 1974, including a run of 29 opening matches without defeat. Leeds United lost the 1975 European Cup Final to Bayern Munich 2–0 and were denied a clear penalty when Clarke was tackled from behind and felled by Franz Beckenbauer in the penalty area.

After this match the Revie side began to break up; their manager had left in 1974 to take the England job, and Clarke himself left the club in 1978 after 351 appearances and 151 goals, with a knee injury curtailing his ability to play at top-flight level. He scored in the 1977 FA Cup semi-final, but the game ended in a 2–1 win by Manchester United.

==International career==
Clarke was called up for England&#x27;s 1970 World Cup squad in Mexico, despite being uncapped. He made his debut for his country against Czechoslovakia in the heat and pressure of a World Cup first-round match. Clarke scored the only goal of the match, from the penalty spot. He remains the most recent England player to make his international debut in a World Cup finals match. Over the next five years he appeared a total of 19 times for England, scoring ten goals.

In 1973, he was in the England team which needed to beat Poland at Wembley to qualify for the 1974 World Cup. A goal down, England were awarded a penalty from which Clarke scored, but other than that, he was among many England players to be thwarted by the Polish goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski. A 1–1 draw was not enough, and England did not go through to play in the 1974 World Cup.

==Managerial career==
Clarke was appointed Barnsley player-manager on 1 June 1978, and under him they won promotion to the old third Division in May 1979, Clarke scoring 12 goals himself that season including a hat-trick against Port Vale on Boxing Day. On 29 December 1979, Barnsley lost 7–0 at Reading, and Clarke decided to end his playing career. He took his players down Woolley Colliery to show them what they could have been doing for a living. Clarke then began to bring in new players such as Trevor Aylott and Derrick Parker and Ian Evans and Barnsley finished mid-table. Clarke left Barnsley in September 1980 to manage Leeds United. Leeds finished 9th under Clarke at the end of his first season as manager, but the following season, they were beaten 5–1 at Swansea on the opening day, and only won once until October. Leeds were relegated and Clarke was sacked on 25 June 1982. He then became manager at Scunthorpe United between February 1983, and 24 August 1984, when he and the chairman both resigned. He led Scunthorpe to promotion to the Third Division in May 1983, but a year later they were relegated.

Clarke had another spell at Barnsley between 1 July 1985 and 8 November 1989. Despite having no money to spend, low gates, and being forced to sell players such as David Hirst and John Beresford, Clarke led Barnsley to the fifth round of the FA Cup twice, when they were knocked out by Arsenal in 1987 and Everton in 1989. At the end of 1988–89 season, Barnsley finished just two points off securing a play-off place, losing only twice in the last 17 games. However, in the following season, after a bright start, a bad run saw Barnsley move, by 4 November, to fifth-from-bottom. Four days later Clarke was sacked. He was Lincoln City caretaker manager for six months, being replaced by Steve Thompson on 30 November 1990.

==Life outside football==
From 1993 until he reached retirement age, Clarke was a travelling salesman for MTS Nationwide, a firm based at Wakefield, West Yorkshire. He has, however, remained an outspoken critic of the game, and like all the Leeds United players of the Revie era, has remained fiercely protective of the reputation of both the manager and the club. He has suffered from arthritic knees in recent years. Clarke now lives in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire.

==The Clarke footballing brothers==
Allan was the second of five brothers to play the professional game – four of whom played for Walsall across three decades.
Frank was the only Clarke brother not to represent Walsall, playing for Shrewsbury Town, Queens Park Rangers, Ipswich Town and Carlisle United; Derek played for Walsall, Oxford United and Orient; Kelvin played for Walsall; and the youngest sibling, Wayne Clarke, played for Walsall towards the end of his career.

<doc id="732798" wikidata="Q2973938" url="?curid=732798" title="Electoral district (Canada)">
<text>An electoral district in Canada is a geographical constituency upon which Canada&#x27;s representative democracy is based. It is officially known in Canadian French as a &quot;circonscription&quot; but frequently called a &quot;comté&quot; (county). In Canadian English it is also colloquially and more commonly known as a riding or constituency.

Each federal electoral district returns one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons of Canada; each provincial or territorial electoral district returns one representative—called, depending on the province or territory, Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA), Member of the National Assembly (MNA), Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) or Member of the House of Assembly (MHA)—to the provincial or territorial legislature.

Since 2015, there have been 338 federal electoral districts in Canada. In provincial and territorial legislatures, the provinces and territories each set their own number of electoral districts independently of their federal representation. The province of Ontario currently defines most of its provincial electoral districts to align with federal boundaries; no other province does so, and even Ontario maintains a few variances from federal boundaries. The ward boundaries of Toronto City Council also correspond to federal electoral district boundaries, although they are numbered rather than using the federal names.

Elections Canada is the independent body set up by Parliament to oversee Canadian federal elections, while each province and territory has its own separate elections agency to oversee the provincial and territorial elections.

==Terminology==
Originally, most electoral districts were equivalent to the counties used for local government, hence the French unofficial term &quot;comté&quot;. However, it became common, especially in Ontario, to divide counties with sufficient population into multiple electoral divisions. The Constitution Act, 1867, which created the electoral map for Ontario for the first federal and provincial general elections, used the term &quot;ridings&quot; to describe districts which were sub-divisions of counties. The word &quot;riding&quot;, from Old English &quot;*þriðing&quot; &quot;one-third&quot; (compare &quot;&quot;, literally &quot;one-fourth&quot;), is an English term denoting a sub-division of a county.

In some of Canada&#x27;s earliest censuses, in fact, some citizens in the Ontario ridings of Bothwell, Cardwell, Monck and Niagara listed their electoral district as their &quot;county&quot; of residence instead of their actual county.

Although the term &quot;riding&quot; is no longer used officially to indicate an electoral district, it has passed into common usage. Soon after Confederation, the urban population grew—and more importantly, most city dwellers gained the franchise after property ownership was no longer required to gain the vote. Rural constituencies therefore became geographically larger through the 20th century and generally encompassed one or more counties each, and the word &quot;riding&quot; became used to refer to any electoral division.

A political party&#x27;s local organization is generally known as a riding association; the legal term is &quot;electoral district association&quot; or EDA.

== Historical multi-member districts ==
While electoral districts at both the federal and provincial levels are now exclusively single-member districts, multiple-member districts have been used in the past. The federal riding of Ottawa elected two members from 1872 to 1933. The federal riding of Halifax elected two members from the 1800s to 1966. The federal riding of Victoria elected two members from 1872 to 1903. As well, eight other federal ridings elected multiple (two) members at different times.

As well, every province plus the territories of Yukon and Northwest Territories at one time or another used multi-seat districts. The use of multi-member districts usually led to the use of plurality block voting but occasionally other forms of voting were used in the multi-seat districts. 

From 1920 to 1949 Winnipeg used single transferable vote (STV) to elect 10 MLAs in a single city-wide district. And then the city was made into three four-member districts, again with the seats filled through STV. St. Boniface elected two MLAs in 1949 and 1953 through STV.

Alberta had three provincial districts that at various times returned two, five, six or seven members: see Calgary, Edmonton and Medicine Hat. Prior to 1924 these seats were filled through plurality block voting but from 1924 to 1956 the seats were filled through single transferable voting (STV).

Saskatchewan used multi-member provincial districts in Saskatoon, Regina and Moose Jaw, from 1920 to 1967. These seats were filled through multiple non-transferable vote.

British Columbia provincially had a mix of multiple-member districts and single-member districts at the provincial level from 1871 to the 1991 election. Members were elected through plurality (first past the post or plurality block voting). The only exception were the 1952 and 1953 elections, when instant-runoff voting was used. In the case of multi-member districts, separate contests were used to elect separate MLAs in the same district.

Prince Edward Island had dual-member districts at the provincial level from Confederation to the 1996 election.

In the case of New Brunswick, between 1935 and 1974, some ridings were multi member districts, electing more than one MLA in a district at each election.

In the case of Ontario, Toronto in 1886 and 1890 was a multi-member provincial district. Limited voting was used to ensure mixed representation and voter satisfaction. From 1908 to 1914, the four Toronto districts elected two MLAs each.

With just a few exceptions, voters in multiple-member districts were able to cast as many votes as there were seats in the district (block voting). Usually, under block voting, one single party took all the seats in the district. STV was used in Alberta and Manitoba multi-member districts from 1920s to 1950s. STV almost always produced mixed representation with no one-party sweep. 

As mentioned, limited voting was used in Toronto when it was a multi-member district.

IRV was used in all BC districts including the multi-member districts, in 1952 and 1953. This voting system ensured that the winner had the support of a majority of votes in each contest but did nothing to create proportionality.

==Naming conventions==
Electoral district names are usually geographic in nature, and chosen to represent the community or region within the electoral district boundaries. Some electoral districts in Quebec are named for historical figures rather than geography, e.g., Louis-Hébert, Honoré-Mercier. Similarly in Alberta, provincial districts mix geographic names with those of historical personages (e.g., Edmonton-Decore after Laurence Decore, Calgary-Lougheed after Peter Lougheed and James Alexander Lougheed). This practice is no longer employed in the other provinces and territories.

==Boundary adjustment for federal electoral districts==
Electoral district boundaries are adjusted to reflect population changes after each decennial census. Depending on the significance of a boundary change, an electoral district&#x27;s name may change as well. Any adjustment of electoral district boundaries is official as of the date the changes are legislated, but is not put into actual effect until the first subsequent election. Thus, an electoral district may officially cease to exist, but will continue to be represented &quot;status quo&quot; in the House of Commons until the next election is called. This, for example, gives new riding associations time to organize, and prevents the confusion that would result from changing elected MPs&#x27; electoral district assignments in the middle of a Parliament.

On some occasions (e.g., Timiskaming—French River, Toronto—Danforth), a riding&#x27;s name may be changed without a boundary adjustment. This usually happens when it is determined at a later date that the existing name is not sufficiently representative of the district&#x27;s geographic boundaries. This is the only circumstance in which a sitting MP&#x27;s riding name may change between elections.

The number of electoral districts for first federal election in 1867 were set by the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; on the principle of representation by population. The Act provided Quebec a minimum of 65 seats and seat allotment for the remainder of the country was based by dividing the average population of Quebec&#x27;s 65 electoral districts to determine the number of seats for other provinces. The Act also specified that distribution and boundary reviews should occur after each 10 year census. The boundaries for Quebec&#x27;s seats were based on the 65 seats Canada East had held in the Parliament of the Province of Canada, prior to Confederation, while the boundaries for Ontario&#x27;s 82 seats were set by the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;.

===Formula for adjusting federal electoral boundaries===
The present formula for adjusting electoral boundaries was adopted in 2022. It starts by calculating an &quot;electoral quotient&quot;, based on the average of the growth rate of the provinces since the time of the last redistribution, the previous redistribution&#x27;s electoral quotient is then multiplied by this average, and then the population of each individual province is divided by this electoral quotient then rounded up to determine the number of seats to which the province is officially entitled. Additionally, one seat is automatically allocated to each of Canada&#x27;s three territories.

Finally, a few special rules are applied. Under the &quot;Senate floor&quot;, a province&#x27;s number of seats in the House of Commons can never be lower than the province&#x27;s representation in the Senate. Under the &quot;grandfather clause&quot;, the province&#x27;s number of seats can also never fall below the number of seats it had in the 43rd Canadian Parliament (2019–2021). Under the &quot;representation rule&quot;, no province that had a higher share of seats than its population share in the last redistribution can have its share of seats drop below its population share.

A province may be allocated extra seats over its base entitlement to ensure that these rules are met. In 2022, for example, Prince Edward Island would have been entitled to only two seats according to the electoral quotient, but through the senatorial clause the province gained two more seats to equal its four senators. Quebec was only entitled to 71 seats by the electoral quotient alone, but through the grandfather clause the province gained seven seats to equal the 78 seats it had in the 43rd Parliament. Saskatchewan and Manitoba also gained seats under the grandfather clause, New Brunswick gained seats under the senatorial clause, and Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador gained seats under the grandfather and senate clauses.

In practice, the process results in most provinces maintaining the same number of seats from one redistribution to the next, due to the senatorial and grandfather clauses—prior to the 2015 election, only Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia, traditionally the country&#x27;s three fastest-growing provinces, had ever gained seats in a redistribution. All other provinces still held the same number of seats that they held in 1985, and were thus already protected from losing even one seat by the other clauses. The 2012 redistribution, which added three new seats in Quebec under the newly added representation rule, was the first and so far only time since 1985 that any of the other seven provinces had ever gained new seats.

Some sources incorrectly state that a special provision guaranteeing a certain number of seats to Quebec is also applied. While such a provision was proposed in the failed Charlottetown Accord, no such rule currently exists—Quebec&#x27;s seat allotment in the House of Commons is in fact governed by the same adjustment clauses as all other provinces, and not by any provisions unique to Quebec alone. However, such provisions have existed at various times in the past. From 1867 to 1946 Quebec was allocated 65 seats, with the other provinces allocated seats based on their size relative to Quebec. The &quot;amalgam formula&quot; of 1976 set the number of Quebec seats to 75, which was to be increased by 4 after each decennial census. Other &quot;large&quot; provinces (over 2.5 million) would be assigned seats based on their relative population to Quebec. The amalgam formula was applied only once, based on the 1971 census. After the 1981 census it was realized that adding an additional four seats to Quebec every ten years would rapidly inflate the size of the House of Commons, so that formula was abandoned in favour of the 1985 Representation Act.

In 2008 the government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper proposed an amendment to the process which would have given Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario, the three provinces whose electoral districts have an average size larger than those in Quebec, a total of 32 additional seats by applying Quebec&#x27;s average of 105,000. The measure initially included only British Columbia and Alberta; Harper later proposed an alternative plan which included Ontario. However, opposition then emerged in Quebec, where politicians expressed concern about the province losing clout in Ottawa if its proportion of seats in the House of Commons were reduced; finally, three new seats were allotted to Quebec as well. The measure did not pass before the 2011 election was called, but was put forward again after the election. It was passed on December 16, 2011 as the Fair Representation Act (Bill C-20), and resulted in the 2012 redistribution process.

On March 24, 2022, the Liberal Trudeau government tabled legislation to prevent Quebec (or any other province) from losing any seats relative to the number of seats it was apportioned in 2012 Canadian federal electoral redistribution. Bill C-14 amended Rule 2 of subsection 51(1) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;Grandfather Clause&quot;. The Bill passed the House of Commons on June 15, 2022, passed the Senate on June 21, 2022, and received royal assent on June 23, 2022. The Chief Electoral Officer announced the new allocation of seats on July 8, 2022, which would result in an increase to 343 seats. The act was introduced after a Bloc Québécois&#x27; motion calling for government action to protect the number of Quebec&#x27;s seat after redistribution. 

===Boundary review of federal electoral districts===
When the province&#x27;s final seat allotment is determined, an independent election boundaries commission in each province reviews the existing boundaries and proposes adjustments. Public input is then sought, which may then lead to changes in the final boundary proposal. For instance, the proposed boundaries may not accurately reflect a community&#x27;s historical, political or economic relationship with its surrounding region; the community would thus advise the boundary commission that it wished to be included in a different electoral district.

For example, in the 2003 boundary adjustment, the boundary commission in Ontario originally proposed dividing the city of Greater Sudbury into three districts. The urban core would have remained largely unchanged as Sudbury, while communities west of the central city would have been merged with Algoma—Manitoulin to form the new riding of Greater Sudbury—Manitoulin, and those east and north of the central city would have been merged with Timiskaming to create the riding of Timiskaming—Greater Sudbury.

Due to the region&#x27;s economic and transportation patterns, however, &quot;Timiskaming—Greater Sudbury&quot; was particularly opposed by its potential residents — voters in Sudbury were concerned about the weakening of their representation if the city were divided into one city-based riding and two large rural ones rather than two city-based ridings, while the Timiskaming District is much more strongly aligned with and connected to North Bay, to which it has a direct highway link, than to Sudbury. In a deputation to the boundary commission, Sudbury&#x27;s deputy mayor Ron Dupuis stated that &quot;An electoral district must be more than a mere conglomeration of arbitrary and random groups of individuals. Districts should, as much as possible, be cohesive units with common interests related to representation. This makes a representative&#x27;s job of articulating the interests of his or her constituency much easier.&quot; Instead, in the final report that was passed by the House of Commons, the Sudbury area&#x27;s existing ridings of Sudbury and Nickel Belt were retained with only minor boundary adjustments, while the Timiskaming riding was merged with Nipissing. Despite the opposition that arose to the 2003 process, however, virtually the same tripartite division of the city was proposed in the boundary adjustment of 2012, although due to concerns around balancing the Northern Ontario region&#x27;s population against its geographic size, the commission announced in 2013 that it would retain the existing electoral districts again.

Similarly, opposition arose in Toronto during the 2012 redistribution process, especially to a proposal which would have divided the Church and Wellesley neighbourhood, the city&#x27;s primary gay village, between the existing riding of Toronto Centre and a new riding of Mount Pleasant along the length of Wellesley Street. In the final report, the northern boundary of Toronto Centre was shifted north to Charles Street.

Once the final report is produced, it is then submitted to Parliament, MPs may offer objections to the boundaries, but the boundary commissions are not compelled to make any changes as a result of the objections.

At Canadian Confederation, the boundaries were defined by the Constitution Act, 1867. Boundaries for one or more electoral districts were updated in 1872, 1882, 1892, 1903, 1914, 1924, 1933, and 1947. Subsequent changes are known as &quot;Representation Order&quot;, and occurred in 1952, 1966, 1976, 1987, 1996, 2003, 2013 and 2023. Such changes come into force &quot;on the first dissolution of Parliament that occurs at least seven months after the day on which that proclamation was issued&quot;.

==Boundary adjustment for provincial and territorial electoral districts==
The boundary adjustment processes for electoral districts in provincial or territorial legislative assemblies follow provincial or territorial, rather than federal, law; they are overseen by each province&#x27;s or territory&#x27;s own election agency rather than by Elections Canada, and legislated by the provincial legislature rather than the federal parliament. Each province is free to decide its own number of legislative assembly seats, and is not required to comply with the federal quotas that govern its number of parliamentary districts.

===Ontario===
Prior to 1999, provincial electoral districts were defined independently of federal districts; at the time of the 1995 Ontario general election, the province had 103 seats in the Canadian House of Commons but 130 in its provincial legislature. For the 1999 Ontario general election, however, the government of Mike Harris passed legislation which mandated that seats in the provincial legislature would follow federal electoral district boundaries, both reducing the size of the legislature and eliminating the cost of the province conducting its own boundary adjustment process. After each federal boundary adjustment, seats in the legislative assembly would henceforth be automatically realigned to match the federal boundaries at the first subsequent provincial election.

Although most electoral districts in the province still conform to federal boundaries, later amendments to the 1999 legislation have reauthorized the introduction of some differences from the federal map. In the Southern Ontario region, provincial districts remain in precise alignment with the federal ones; in the Northern Ontario region, however, because the region&#x27;s slower growth would result in the gradual loss of seats compared to the more rapidly growing south, most districts still retain the same boundaries as the federal districts that were in place as of 2003, and are not readjusted to correspond to current federal boundaries. For the 2018 Ontario general election, further, two new uniquely provincial districts were added to increase representation for the far north of the province. As a result, the province currently has 121 seats in the House of Commons, but 124 seats in the provincial legislature. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following the 2022 federal electoral redistribution, Premier Doug Ford announced his government would break with tradition and not update the provincial boundaries to match those of the new federal ridings, meaning the majority of Ontario&#x27;s provincial ridings will have different names and/or borders from their federal counterparts following the 2025 federal election.
===Prince Edward Island===
When Prince Edward Island joined Confederation in 1873, it set a fixed formula in which each of the province&#x27;s three counties was divided into five electoral districts per county, each of which elected two representatives to the provincial legislature. These districts were never adjusted for demographic changes, except in 1966 when the district for the capital city of Charlottetown was divided into two. After 1966, however, the electoral district boundaries again remained unchanged until 1996, when the province adopted new single-member districts. Under the new model, electoral districts are now adjusted every ten years, although most adjustments are geographically modest and the district&#x27;s name is sometimes, but not always, the only substantive change that actually occurs.

== Political issues ==
Because electoral district boundaries are proposed by an arms-length body, rather than directly by political parties themselves, gerrymandering is not generally seen as an issue in Canada. However, in 2006 the provincial government of Prince Edward Island was accused of gerrymandering after it rejected the independent boundary commission&#x27;s report and instead proposed a new map that would have seen the cities of Charlottetown and Summerside each gain one additional seat, with two fewer seats allocated to rural areas of the province. The alternate map gave every incumbent member of the governing party a &quot;safe&quot; seat to run in, while the original report would have forced some of the party&#x27;s MLAs to compete against each other in nomination contests.

The unequal size of electoral districts across Canada has sometimes given rise to discussion of whether all Canadians enjoy equal democratic representation by population. For example, the four federal electoral districts in Prince Edward Island have an average size of just 33,963 voters each, while federal electoral districts in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia have an average size of over 125,000 voters each—only slightly smaller, in fact, than the &quot;entire&quot; population of Prince Edward Island.

Conversely, pure representation by population creates distinct disadvantages for some Canadians, giving rise to frequent debate about how to balance the population size of electoral districts against their geographic size. Whereas urban districts, such as Toronto Centre, Vancouver Centre or Papineau, may be as small as or less, more rural districts, such as Timmins-James Bay, Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik—Eeyou or Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River may encompass tens or hundreds of thousands of square kilometres. Thus, while Canadians who reside in major urban centres typically live within walking distance of their federal or provincial representatives&#x27; constituency offices, a rural resident may not even be able to call their federal or provincial representative&#x27;s constituency offices without incurring long-distance calling charges.

Further, a rural politician who represents dozens of geographically dispersed small towns must normally incur much greater travel expenses, being forced to drive for several hours, or even to travel by air, in order to visit parts of their own district—and may even need to maintain more than one constituency office in order to properly represent all of their constituents. In Ontario, for example, the highest annual expense budgets among members of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario are consistently filed by the representatives for Mushkegowuk—James Bay and Kiiwetinoong, the province&#x27;s two largest and northernmost electoral districts; both must spend far more on travel to and from Toronto, travel within their own ridings and additional support staff in multiple communities within their ridings than any other legislator in the province.

==Demographics of ridings==
A 2017 study found, that 41 of the 338 federal ridings, have populations where visible minorities/non-Whites form the majority of the riding. Ontario and British Columbia have the largest number of ridings where visible minorities form the majority. Quebec has the most ridings with less than 5% visible minorities.

<text>Wolfgang Grams (March 6, 1953 – June 27, 1993) was a member of the Red Army Faction (RAF), a German far-left militant organisation from 1970 to 1998. Grams&#x27; death, officially while resisting arrest, caused a major political scandal and the circumstances continue to be debated.

==Life==

Wolfgang Grams was born in Wiesbaden, Germany. His parents, Werner and Ruth Grams, were expelled from the east. Werner Grams volunteered for service in the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;. They had another son, Rainer.

During Grams&#x27; younger years, his family lived near the Wiesbaden Army Airfield, and he demonstrated against the Vietnam War.

While living in a commune, he was given the nickname &quot;Gaks&quot;. After the arrest of Andreas Baader and Gudrun Ensslin, he started visiting RAF prisoners in jail. He found the conditions of solitary confinement inhumane.

Grams&#x27; name was found in a note book of an RAF militant who was killed during an arrest attempt. He was kept in custody for 153 days, but was given remuneration in 1980. He then met Birgit Hogefeld, and they began dating and moved in together.

On February 15, 1987, the &quot;Tagesschau&quot; on ARD ran a bulletin on Grams and Hogefeld. He was described as tall and with blue green eyes and a striking dark skin discoloration on his face. From 1984 on he lived underground. Only in the Autumn of 1990 did he come home to meet with his parents in Taunus.

Later DNA evidence connects Gram to the killing of Detlev Karsten Rohwedder in 1991.

==Death==
On June 27, 1993, members of the GSG 9, the counter-terrorism and special operations unit of the German Federal Police (BPOL; Bundespolizei), were assigned to arrest Grams and Hogefeld at the train station in Bad Kleinen. Instead, Grams pulled a gun and shot two BKA officers, including one, Michael Newrzella, fatally. Officers were quoted as saying they saw Grams &quot;suddenly fall backward&quot; off the station platform and onto the track. Either before or after he fell, he allegedly shot himself in the head rather than be taken alive. He was taken to the Medizinische Universität zu Lübeck by helicopter where he died from his wounds a few hours later.

Shortly after the operation there were allegations that Grams had not shot himself but was executed with a shot in the head from close range by a GSG 9 officer. The Staatsanwaltschaft Schwerin investigated these allegations and concluded in January 1994 that these allegations were incorrect. Grams&#x27; parents challenged this conclusion in court, but it was upheld by five different courts, including the European Court of Human Rights in 1999.

Interior Minister Rudolf Seiters took responsibility for the poor conducting and postprocessing of the operation and resigned in July of the year, as well as Chief Federal Prosecutor, Alexander von Stahl. Helmut Kohl paid a visit to the unit, praising Officer Newrzella and discouraged &quot;attempts to make a martyr of his murderer.&quot;

==In popular culture==
*The award-winning 2001 German documentary movie &quot;Black Box BRD&quot; retells the lives and deaths of Wolfgang Grams and Alfred Herrhausen, a German banker in whose assassination Grams is suspected of having been involved.
*The incident has been widely criticised in German punk rock songs such as &quot;Kopfschuss&quot; (&quot;head shot&quot;) by WIZO, &quot;Bad K.&quot; by Dritte Wahl or &quot;Gewalt&quot; (&quot;violence&quot;) by Slime.

<text>Suramin is a medication used to treat African sleeping sickness and river blindness. It is the treatment of choice for sleeping sickness without central nervous system involvement. It is given by injection into a vein.
Suramin causes a fair number of side effects. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, skin tingling, and weakness. Sore palms of the hands and soles of the feet, trouble seeing, fever, and abdominal pain may also occur. Severe side effects may include low blood pressure, decreased level of consciousness, kidney problems, and low blood cell levels. It is unclear if it is safe when breastfeeding.
Suramin was made at least as early as 1916. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In the United States it can be acquired from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). In regions of the world where the disease is common suramin is provided for free by the World Health Organization (WHO).

==Medical uses==
Suramin is used for treatment of human sleeping sickness caused by trypanosomes. Specifically, it is used for treatment of first-stage African trypanosomiasis caused by &quot;Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense&quot; and &quot;Trypanosoma brucei gambiense&quot; without involvement of central nervous system. It is considered first-line treatment for &quot;Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense&quot;, and second-line treatment for early-stage &quot;Trypanosoma brucei gambiense&quot;, where pentamidine is recommended as first line.

It has been used in the treatment of river blindness (onchocerciasis).

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
It is unknown whether it is safe for the baby when a woman takes it while breastfeeding.

==Adverse reactions==
The most frequent adverse reactions are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and a feeling of general discomfort. It is also common to experience various sensations in the skin, from crawling or tingling sensations, tenderness of palms and the soles, and numbness of hands, arm, legs or feet. Other skin reactions include skin rash, swelling and stinging sensation. Suramin can also cause loss of appetite and irritability. Suramin causes non-harmful changes in urine during use, specifically making the urine cloudy. It may exacerbate kidney disease.

Less common side effects include extreme fatigue, ulcers in the mouth, and painful tender glands in the neck, armpits and groin. Suramin uncommonly affects the eyes causing watery eyes, swelling around the eyes, photophobia, and changes or loss of vision.

Rare side effects include hypersensitivity reactions causing difficulty breathing. Other rare systemic effects include decreased blood pressure, fever, rapid heart rate, and convulsions. Other rare side effects include symptoms of liver dysfunction such as tenderness in upper abdomen, jaundice in eyes and skin, unusual bleeding or bruising.

Suramin has been applied clinically to HIV/AIDS patients resulting in a significant number of fatal occurrences and as a result the application of this molecule was abandoned for this condition.

== Pharmacology ==

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Suramin is not orally bioavailable and must be given intravenously. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administration could result in local tissue inflammation or necrosis . Suramin is approximately 99-98% protein bound in the serum and has a half-life of 41–78 days average of 50 days; however, the pharmacokinetics of suramin can vary substantially between individual patients. Suramin does not distribute well into cerebral spinal fluid and its concentration in the tissues is equivalently lower than its concentration in the plasma. Suramin is not extensively metabolized and about 80% is eliminated via the kidneys.

=== Mechanism of action ===
The mechanism of action for suramin is unclear, but it is thought that parasites are able to selectively uptake suramin via receptor-mediated endocytosis of drug that is bound to low-density lipoproteins and, to a lesser extent, other serum proteins. Once inside parasites, suramin combines with proteins, especially trypanosomal glycolytic enzymes, to inhibit energy metabolism.

==Chemistry==
The molecular formula of suramin is C51H40N6O23S6. It is a symmetric molecule in the center of which lies a urea (NH–CO–NH) functional group. Suramin contains six aromatic systems – four benzene rings, sandwiched by a pair of naphthalene moieties – plus four amide functional groups (in addition to the urea) and six sulfonic acid groups. When given as a medication, it is usually delivered as the sodium sulfonate salt as this formulation is water-soluble, though it does deteriorate rapidly in air.

The synthesis of suramin itself and structural analogs is by successive formation of the amide bonds from their corresponding amine (aniline) and carboxyl (as acyl chloride) components. Various routes to these compounds have been developed, including starting from separate naphthalene structures and building towards an eventual unification by formation of the urea or starting with a urea and appending successive groups.

==History==
Suramin was first made by the chemists Oskar Dressel, Richard Kothe and Bernhard Heymann at Bayer AG laboratories in Elberfeld, after research on a series of urea-like compounds. The drug is still sold by Bayer under the brand name Germanin. The chemical structure of suramin was kept secret by Bayer for commercial and strategic reasons, but it was elucidated and published in 1924 by Ernest Fourneau and his team at the Pasteur Institute.

==Research==
It is also used as a research reagent to inhibit the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins in a variety of GPCRs with varying potency. It prevents the association of heteromeric G proteins and therefore the receptors guanine exchange functionality (GEF). With this blockade the GDP will not release from the Gα subunit so it can not be replaced by a GTP and become activated. This has the effect of blocking downstream G protein mediated signaling of various GPCR proteins including rhodopsin, the A1 adenosine receptor, the D2 receptor, the P2 receptor, and ryanodine receptors. Suramin is also an inhibitor of ABC-type and P-type ATPases, which acts competitively with ATP.

Suramin was studied as a possible treatment for prostate cancer in a clinical trial.

Suramin has been studied in a mouse model of autism and in a small phase I/II human trial. Results from a randomized clinical study found no statistically significant effects of suramin (in either 10mg or 20mg doses) versus placebo on boys with moderate to severe autism spectrum disorder.

Suramin is a reversible and competitive protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPases) inhibitor, also is the potent inhibitor of sirtuins, purified topoisomerase II and SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).

<text>Chiquimula is one of the 22 departments of Guatemala, in Central America. The departmental capital is also called Chiquimula. The department was established by decree in 1871, and forms a part of the southeastern region of Guatemala. Physically, it is mountainous, with a climate that varies between tropical and temperate, depending on the location.

==History==
At the time of Spanish contact, Chiquimula was part of the indigenous kingdom of Chiquimulha, or Payaqui, governed from its capital at Copanti (now Copan, in Honduras). This kingdom also included portions of Honduras and El Salvador. The name Chiquimula is derived from the Nahuatl &quot;chiquimoltlān&quot;, from &quot;chiquimolin&quot; meaning &quot;finches&quot; with the locative suffix &quot;-tlān&quot;, to mean &quot;place of many finches&quot;.

Chiquimula de la Sierra (&quot;Chiquimula in the Highlands&quot;), occupying the area of the modern department, was inhabited by Ch&#x27;orti&#x27; Maya at the time of the conquest. The first Spanish reconnaissance of this region took place in 1524 by an expedition that included Hernando de Chávez, Juan Durán, Bartolomé Becerra and Cristóbal Salvatierra, amongst others. In 1526 three Spanish captains, Juan Pérez Dardón, Sancho de Barahona and Bartolomé Becerra, invaded Chiquimula on the orders of Pedro de Alvarado. The indigenous population soon rebelled against excessive Spanish demands, but the rebellion was quickly put down in April 1530. However, the region was not considered fully conquered until a campaign by Jorge de Bocanegra in 1531–1532 that also took in parts of Jalapa. The afflictions of Old World diseases, war and overwork in the mines and &quot;encomiendas&quot; took a heavy toll on the inhabitants of eastern Guatemala, to the extent that indigenous population levels never recovered to their pre-conquest levels.

The modern department was created by executive decree on 10 November 1871. The decree reduced the area covered by the administrative division of Chiquimula by removing that portion that now forms the modern department of Zacapa and part of the department of Izabal.

==Geography==
Chiquimula is located in the southeastern region of Guatemala. It is bordered by the department of Zacapa to the north and the departments of Jalapa and Zacapa to the west. To the south, Chiqimula is bordered by the department of Jutiapa and the republic of El Salvador. To the east, the department is bordered by the republic of Honduras.

The departmental capital is the city of Chiquimula, which is from Guatemala City.

Mountains cross the department from north to south, crossing from the border with Jalapa and joining the Sierra del Merendón range, which extends into neighbouring Honduras and El Salvador. Chiquimula possesses two drainage basins, one flowing towards the Atlantic Ocean, the other towards the Pacific Ocean. The principal river in the department is the Río Grande, or Camotán River, which flows in from Honduras, before becoming the Jocotán River, and flowing into the Motagua River to eventually drain into the Caribbean Sea. In the south of the department, the most important rivers are the Anguiatú and the Ostúa.

The department has numerous mineral deposits, and silver has been mined there since the Spanish colonial period.

==Climate==
Chiquimula is divided into two climatic zones; the municipalities of Concepción Las Minas, Esquipulas, Ipala, Olopa and Quetzaltepeque are temperate, while Camotán, Chiquimula, Jocotán, San Jacinto, San José La Arada and San Juan Ermita are tropical. In the temperate areas, the average temperature is ; in the tropical areas it reaches . Climate change has notably affected the department, with maximum temperatures reaching , and a decrease in rainfall contributing to scarcity of foodstuffs. The lowest recorded temperature between 2009 and 2013 was in 2010; during the same period, relative humidity varied between 74.5% and 76.6%. Average annual precipitation is .

==Population==
At the 2018 census, the population of Chiquimula was 415,063. In 2002, 83.33% of the population was non-indigenous and 16.67% was indigenous. The majority of the indigenous population are Ch&#x27;orti&#x27; Maya, with a very small number of Xinka and Garifuna. In 2006, 59.5% of the population of the department was living in poverty, with 27.7% of the population living in extreme poverty (included within the former percentage). Poverty levels tend to be higher in the northern portions of the department, and lower in the south. In 2002, the department of Chiquimula contained 2.7% of the national population, with a population density of , ranking it 10th of 22 departments for population density. In 2013, 25.5% of the population were recorded as illiterate, demonstrating a year-on-year reduction in illiteracy rates over the previous five years.

In 2002, 26% of the population of the department lived in urban areas, and 74% in rural areas. There were an average of 5.1 people per household; averaging 4.5 people per household in urban areas and rising to an average of 5.3 people per household in rural areas.

===Ethnicity and language===
Breakdown of population by ethnicity for the whole departmental population, and first language in those aged three and above, as recorded in the 2002 census. 
===Mortality===
In 2013, 2095 deaths were registered in the department, demonstrating a 1% drop on the previous year, and 2.9% of the national total:
==Governance==

As with all Guatemalan departments, the regional government is headed by a governor appointed directly by the president of Guatemala.

=== Municipalities ===
Since its establishment as a department in the late 19th century, Chiquimula has been divided into eleven municipalities.
==Economy==
Principle products of the department of Chiquimula are cattle, rice, maize, beans, potato, coffee, cacao, peanuts and tropical fruits, ceramics, rope, leather and palm products. Palm handicrafts include the manufacture of a variety of baskets for different purposes.

==Tourism==

Esquipulas is one of the most important centres for religious pilgrimage in Central America, focused upon the Black Christ of Esquipulas contained in the basilica church, which has been venerated due to miracles attributed to the image.

==In the news 2021==
In January 2021, a caravan of between 7,000 and 9,000 migrants from Honduras, who had departed from San Pedro Sula was heading towards the United States and broke through police lines at Vado Hondo, a village near the city of Chiquimula.

<text>Thomas Nettleship Staley (17 January 1823 – 1 November 1898) was a British bishop of the Church of England and the first Anglican bishop of the Church of Hawaii (called at the time Bishop of Honolulu).

==Life==
Thomas Nettleship Staley was born 17 January 1823 in Sheffield, Yorkshire, England. His father was the Wesleyan minister William Staley. Staley entered Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge in 1840, earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1844, and became a Fellow in 1847 after earning his Master of Arts degree. He was tutor at St Mark&#x27;s College, Chelsea, from 1844 to 1848 and headmaster of St Mark&#x27;s Practising School from 1848 to 1850 (whilst still lecturing in mathematics at St Mark&#x27;s College) and then principal of the Collegiate School, Wandsworth, from 1850 to 1861. He married Catherine Workman Shirley in September 1850.

He was appointed by John Bird Sumner, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and consecrated on 15 December 1861, at the suggestion of Samuel Wilberforce and Queen Victoria, as the church&#x27;s first Bishop of Honolulu, for the Kingdom of Hawaii. He departed on 17 August 1862 and arrived in Honolulu in October 1862, several weeks after the death of Albert, Prince of Hawaii, the only son of King Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma Kaleleonālani Naea.
His presence provoked conflict with the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions because they considered him a symbol of ritualism. The fact that he was a bishop also bothered the Calvinists who disliked any kind of religious hierarchy. In a letter to Rufus Anderson of the American Board, the British missionary William Ellis (who had visited the Hawaiian Islands in 1825) wrote that Staley was &quot;associated with that section of the Church of England from which the greatest number of perverts to Popery has proceeded, and between whom and the Roman Catholics the difference is reported to be slight ...&quot; Even the American writer Mark Twain criticized Staley as an agent of Britain.

Staley publicly defended his actions as being non-political, but was considered symbolic of the struggle for influence on the islands. Although he was appointed to the King&#x27;s Privy Council 1863–1864 and Board of Education in 1865, he denied ever giving political advice, or being behind any plots leading to British colonization of the islands. In December 1863 he held the memorial service for Kamehameha IV and later dedicated the Royal Mausoleum where the royal family was reburied. The next King Kamehameha V continued his support and the cornerstone for the Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew was laid in a ceremony in March 1867. On 13 June 1865, his young daughter was baptised at a temporary cathedral in Honolulu.

Staley began two church-operated Saint Andrew&#x27;s Priory School for Girls and ʻIolani School in Honolulu (originally named for Saint Alban). Staley was appointed Chaplain of Hawaii&#x27;s Royal Order of Kamehameha I.

He corresponded with Charles Darwin regarding the decline in population of the native Hawaiians.

Staley was frustrated with the political struggle and suggested he would like to resign. He hoped to be replaced by an American Episcopal bishop, but none could be found. He reluctantly retired in 1870 and was replaced by Alfred Willis; he was reported on 25 February to havealready tendered his resignation. He resided in Croxall and died on 1 November 1898 at Bournemouth.

<doc id="732839" wikidata="Q16835935" url="?curid=732839" title="Executive agreement">
<text>An executive agreement is an agreement between the heads of government of two or more nations that has not been ratified by the legislature as treaties are ratified. Executive agreements are considered &quot;politically binding&quot; to distinguish them from treaties which are &quot;legally binding&quot;.

In the United States, executive agreements are made solely by the President of the United States. They are one of three mechanisms by which the United States enters into binding international obligations. Some authors consider executive agreements to be treaties under international law in that they bind both the United States and another sovereign state. However, under United States constitutional law, executive agreements are not considered treaties for the purpose of the Treaty Clause of the United States Constitution, which requires the advice and consent of two-thirds of the Senate to qualify as a treaty.

Some other nations have similar provisions with regard to the ratification of treaties.

==In general==
Executive agreements are often used in order to bypass the requirements of national constitutions for ratification of treaties. Many nations that are republics with written constitutions have constitutional rules about the ratification of treaties. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe is based on executive agreements.

==In the United States==

===Federal government===

In the United States, executive agreements are binding internationally if they are negotiated and entered into under the president&#x27;s authority in foreign policy, as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, or from a prior act of Congress. For instance, as commander-in-chief, the president negotiates and enters into status of forces agreements (SOFAs), which govern the treatment and disposition of U.S. forces stationed in other nations. The president cannot, however, enter unilaterally into executive agreements on matters that are beyond their constitutional authority. In such instances, an agreement would need to be in the form of a congressional-executive agreement, or a treaty with Senate advice and consent.

The U.S. Supreme Court, in &quot;United States v. Pink&quot; (1942), held that international executive agreements validly made have the same legal status as treaties and did not require Senate approval. In &quot;Reid v. Covert&quot; (1957), while reaffirming the president’s ability to enter into executive agreements, the court also held that such agreements cannot contradict existing federal law or the Constitution.

The Case–Zablocki Act of 1972 requires the president to inform the Senate within 60 days of any executive agreement being made. No restriction was placed on presidential powers to make such agreements. The notification requirement enabled Congress to vote to cancel an executive agreement, or to refuse to fund its implementation.

===State government===
Governors or other statewide executive officers may sign onto joint agreements with their counterparts in other state governments which may not have the legal backing of their respective legislatures.

<text>54 Alexandra is a carbonaceous asteroid from the intermediate asteroid belt, approximately 155 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by German-French astronomer Hermann Goldschmidt on 10 September 1858, and named after the German explorer Alexander von Humboldt; it was the first asteroid to be named after a male.

== Description ==

On May 17, 2005, this asteroid occulted a faint star (magnitude 8.5) and the event was observed and timed in a number of locations within the U.S. and Mexico. As a result, a silhouette profile was produced, yielding a roughly oval cross-section with dimensions of 160 × 135 km (± 1 km). The mass of the asteroid can be estimated based upon the mutually perturbing effects of other bodies, yielding an estimate of .

Photometric observations of this asteroid during 1990–92 gave a light curve with a period of 18.14 ± 0.04 hours and a brightness variation of 0.10 in magnitude. Alexandra has been studied by radar. It was the namesake and largest member of the former Alexandra asteroid family; a dynamic group of C-type asteroids that share similar orbital elements. Other members included 70 Panopaea and 145 Adeona. 145 Adeona was subsequently assigned to the Adeona family, with Alexandra and Panopaea being dropped.

==In Popular Culture==

In the Swedish film Aniara (2018) it is mentioned that 54 Alexandra is the closest celestial body which the off-course and out-of-control spacecraft will approach before it leaves the Solar System.

<text>Jutiapa Department is a department of Guatemala that borders along El Salvador and the Pacific Ocean. The capital is the city of Jutiapa. As of 2018, it has a population of 488,395. The department is divided into seventeen municipalities. Jutiapa is the country&#x27;s southeasternmost department and officially the only department with no Mayan descendants native to the region. The main crops are sorghum, tobacco, onion and corn. The climate is dry. An important attraction is the cattle fair. It is at 405 m above sea level.

The population is ethnically &quot;Ladino&quot; (of European descent &amp; non Mayan-indigenous), though in the northern regions of Jutiapa there are few descendants that once belonged to the Xinca population. The Xinca people were of non-Mayan descent.

The coat of arms contains the cornucopia symbolizing Jutiapa as the barn of the East, supplying Guatemala with most of the grain consumed by the people. The horse and the cow represent the cattle; the books stand for educational and cultural advances. In the background sits La Cruz hill, the firm guardian of the departmental chief town, with the tower or antenna of a Jutiapa radio station. Behind the hill float the clouds, the sky and the sun of Jutiapa, &quot;The Sun City&quot;. This coat of arms is placed on the flag between two laurel branches symbolizing the daily triumphs of the sons of Jutiapa. The flag is mainly white, showing in its center the coat of arms adapted and adroned, between two laurel branches.

Jutiapa was subject to CIA monitoring in the lead-up to the CIA&#x27;s successful coup d&#x27;état deposing the democratically elected Guatemalan President Jacobo Árbenz.

<doc id="732848" wikidata="Q326316" url="?curid=732848" title="Robert Torricelli">
<text>Robert Guy Torricelli (born August 27, 1951) is an American attorney and former politician. A Democrat, Torricelli served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from New Jersey&#x27;s 9th district from 1983 to 1997 and as a United States senator from New Jersey from 1997 to 2003.

He is notable for his tenure as chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. In September 2002, Torricelli ended his Senate re-election campaign after having been formally admonished by the U.S. Senate in connection with a campaign finance scandal. He later founded Rosemont Associates and Woodrose Properties. Rosemont is an international consulting firm and Woodrose has developed and managed commercial and multi family real estate in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Florida.

==Early life and education==
Torricelli was born in Paterson, New Jersey, the son of Betty (Lotz), a school librarian, and Salvatore Torricelli, a lawyer. After graduation from Storm King School in Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York, Torricelli attended Rutgers University, New Brunswick where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1974. He then earned his J.D. degree in 1977 from Rutgers Law School in Newark. He was admitted to the New Jersey bar in 1978 and later attended Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government, earning a master&#x27;s in public administration in 1980.

==Career==
Torricelli was an assistant to the Governor of New Jersey, Brendan Byrne, from 1975 to 1977. In 1978, he served as associate counsel to Vice President Walter Mondale, and managed the Carter-Mondale campaign in the Illinois primary. At the 1980 Democratic National Convention, he served as the director of the Rules Committee.

===U.S. Representative===
In 1982, Torricelli ran for U.S. Congress, defeating incumbent Republican Harold Hollenbeck. Torricelli served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1983 until 1997 representing New Jersey&#x27;s 9th congressional district.

Torricelli was a resident of New Milford, New Jersey during his first term in Congress.

Torricelli was Democratic floor leader in the Persian Gulf War discussion regarding the adoption of the &quot;Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution&quot; in 1991 and gave the closing speech.

In 1988, Torricelli visited Cuba and stated, &quot;Living standards are not high, but the homelessness, hunger and disease that is witnessed in much of Latin America does not appear evident.&quot; He sponsored the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 which prohibits U.S. trade with Cuba. Torricelli stated that the act would &quot;wreak havoc on that island. He defended the legislation as necessary to force democratic refirm on the island and halt Castro’s export of violent revolution in Latin America. After candidate Bill Clinton endorsed the legislation, President Bush signed it.&quot; Academic Helen Yaffe writes that between Toricelli&#x27;s 1988 visit and the 1992 Act, he received significant campaign contributions from the Cuban American National Foundation.

He was chairman of the House subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere.

===U.S. senator ===
Torricelli was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1996, defeating Republican Congressman Dick Zimmer by 291,511 votes to obtain the seat vacated by the retirement of Democratic Senator Bill Bradley. It was later found that six donors had made illegal contributions to Torricelli&#x27;s campaign. In 2000, he headed the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee which regained the Democratic majority in the Senate. Torricelli was responsible for recruiting Senate candidates including Hillary Clinton. As a member of the Senate Finance Committee Torricelli amended the tax code to permit the partial deduction of college tuition for the first time. After 9/11, he amended legislation to authorize a new rail tunnel to NYC.

A federal criminal investigation into Torricelli was dropped in early 2002. In the summer of 2002, however, Torricelli received a formal letter of admonishment from the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Ethics following an investigation into his alleged receipt of improper gifts from campaign donor David Chang, who had pleaded guilty to violating federal election laws. Torricelli apologized to voters for his behavior and delivered a speech in which he promised to take &quot;&#x27;full personal responsibility&#x27;&quot; for his actions. On September 30, 2002, Torricelli ended his 2002 re-election campaign after Republicans &quot;successfully made the incumbent&#x27;s ethics troubles -- stemming from illegal 1996 campaign donations and questionable gifts -- a campaign issue...&quot; Shortly thereafter, the New Jersey Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Democratic Party could legally replace Torricelli&#x27;s name on the ballot with that of former U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg.

In 2007, Torricelli drew public criticism despite federal rules allowing retired officials to give leftover campaign funds to political parties, candidates and charities when his leftover campaign funds, given to the Rosemont Foundation, were not funneled back to his political party. The Rosemont Foundation donates funds to animal welfare charities with particular emphasis on dog shelters.

During his time in the Senate, Torricelli was a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, the Finance Committee, and the Rules Committee.

===Post-congressional career===
In 2003, Torricelli was appointed by the U.S. Federal District Court as special master overseeing the environmental cleanup project of the Mutual Chemical site in Jersey City, New Jersey, owned by the Honeywell Corporation.

Torricelli founded business and government affairs consulting firm Rosemont Associates. He is a partner in real estate firm Woodrose Properties, which is invested in over 50 multi family or commercial properties in 10 states. Torricelli has represented the Iranian opposition group, the MEK.

==Personal life==
Torricelli was married to Susan Holloway and has dated Bianca Jagger.

<text>Behind Enemy Lines is a 2001 American action war film directed by John Moore in his directorial debut, and starring Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman. The film tells the story of Lieutenant Chris Burnett, an American naval flight officer who is shot down over Bosnia and uncovers genocide during the Bosnian War. Meanwhile, the rear admiral commanding the carrier strike group to which he is assigned is struggling to gain approval to launch a combat search and rescue mission to save Burnett. The plot is loosely based on the 1995 Mrkonjić Grad incident that occurred during the war.

Released on November 30, 2001, &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot; received generally negative reviews from critics. However, it was a considerable box office success, taking in nearly $92 million worldwide against a $40 million budget.

The film started a franchise of direct-to-video spiritual successors: &quot;Behind Enemy Lines II: Axis of Evil&quot;, &quot;Behind Enemy Lines: Colombia&quot;, &quot;SEAL Team 8: Behind Enemy Lines&quot;, co-produced by WWE Studios.

==Plot==
During the Bosnian War, United States Navy flight officer Lieutenant Chris Burnett and pilot Lieutenant Jeremy Stackhouse are stationed on the aircraft carrier in the Adriatic Sea. Fed up with the battle readiness routine, Burnett is preparing to leave the Navy, and clashes with his commanding officer, Rear Admiral Leslie Reigart. On Christmas, Reigart assigns Burnett and Stackhouse to fly an aerial reconnaissance mission, which goes smoothly until they spot unusual activity in the demilitarized zone. Burnett persuades Stackhouse to fly their F/A-18F Super Hornet off-course for a closer look, unaware that they are photographing Serb Volunteer Guard soldiers burying massacred Bosniak civilians in mass graves. The local Bosnian Serb paramilitary commander, General Miroslav Lokar, is conducting a secret genocidal campaign against the Bosniak population, and orders the jet be shot down.

Attempting to outmaneuver Lokar&#x27;s surface-to-air missiles, Burnett and Stackhouse&#x27;s jet is hit, forcing them to eject. Lokar and his men find the injured Stackhouse, who is executed by Sasha Ivanic, Lokar&#x27;s personal assassin. Watching nearby, Burnett gives away his position and flees into the wilderness, and Lokar orders his deputy, Colonel Bazda, and Sasha to hunt him down. Burnett radios for help and receives an extraction point from Reigart, who is forced to stand down after Admiral Piquet, the commander of NATO naval forces in the region, warns him that rescuing Burnett in the demilitarized zone risks derailing the peace process. Burnett reaches the extraction point only to be informed that he must continue to another location, miles outside the demilitarized zone, in order to be rescued.

Spotting Bazda&#x27;s patrol, Burnett falls into a mass grave, and conseals himself under the corpses until the Serbs move on. To ensure Burnett&#x27;s rescue, Reigart leaks news of the downed jet to Sky News, angering Piquet. Lokar realizes that the American jet&#x27;s optical disc with the incriminating photographs may still be in the wreckage. Heading to the new extraction point, Burnett escapes Serb soldiers through a minefield. Pursued by Sasha, he encounters Bosniak guerrillas who offer him a ride to the town of Hač, which turns out to be a war zone. After the battle, Serb troops believe they have found Burnett&#x27;s body, but Sasha recognized a prison tattoo on the body, and determined that Burnett switched uniforms with a dead Serb guerrilla and escaped. To buy more time to catch Burnett, the Serbs present the corpse wearing Burnett&#x27;s uniform to the media with his head covered, convincing NATO forces that Burnett has been killed, and the mission to rescue him is aborted just as he reaches the extraction point.

Realizing why the Serbs shot him down, Burnett remembers a statue of an angel near where his ejection seat landed, and returns to find it. He reactivates the seat&#x27;s rescue beacon, notifying his carrier group that he is still alive, but also alerting the Serbs to his location. Knowing he risks being relieved of command, Reigart prepares a Marine Force Recon task force to rescue Burnett, in defiance of Piquet&#x27;s orders. On the way to kill Burnett and recover his body, Bazda steps on a landmine; Sasha abandons him to his fate, and the explosion alerts Burnett that someone is approaching. Sasha finds the ejection seat, but is ambushed by Burnett, who, despite taking a shot in the arm, fatally stabs him with the spike of a railroad flare. Lokar arrives with armored vehicles and infantry, but is held off by Reigart&#x27;s task force. Retrieving the optical disc, Burnett is successfully rescued, much to the dismay of Lokar as his crime is now being exposed.

The photographs of the mass grave lead to Lokar&#x27;s arrest and conviction for war crimes including genocide. Reigart&#x27;s actions result in him being relieved of command and retiring from service, and Burnett continues his career in the Navy.

==Production== 
In December 1996, it was announced 20th Century Fox had greenlit &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot; from Davis Entertainment based on Scott O&#x27;Grady and the Banja Luka incident with David Nutter set to direct. In December 1999, it was announced commercial director John Moore had been hired to direct the film as his feature debut with James Van Der Beek attached to star. By July 2000, it was announced Van Der Beek had been replaced by Owen Wilson.

The film was shot at the Koliba Studios in Bratislava, Slovakia and on location in the Slovakian village of Háj (in the village of Háj there is also a prop of an angel from the film).

 was the aircraft carrier featured in the film. Exterior naval footage was filmed on board the carrier. Interiors were filmed on , and on a film set. The release date was originally January 18, 2002, but this was moved to November 30, 2001.

==Historical inspiration==

The film bears some resemblance to the experiences of former U.S. Air Force Captain Scott O&#x27;Grady, who was shot down over Bosnia on June 2, 1995. He survived for six days before being rescued by U.S. Marines. O&#x27;Grady, who later became a children&#x27;s author and motivational speaker, filed suit against both the producers of &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot; as well as &quot;Behind Enemy Lines: The Scott O’Grady Story&quot;, a 1998 documentary that Discovery Channel aired on his experience, for defamation of character, accusing the film&#x27;s producers of invasion of privacy through the misappropriation of his name, likeness and identity, false representation and false advertising, and contending that those involved in both works produced them without his permission, and that the commercial value of his name was damaged by them. O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s complaint indicated that among other things, he was troubled by the disobedience and profanity exhibited by the feature film&#x27;s main character. O&#x27;Grady also accused Fox of using the documentary to promote the feature film and making a film about his ordeal without his permission. The film&#x27;s characters and events differ from O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s experience; he never entered populated areas, nor did he interact with civilians, and did not engage in direct combat with enemy soldiers. Also, O&#x27;Grady never flew an F/A-18F, but rather an F-16 Fighting Falcon. The case was settled out of court.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film made $18.7 million in its opening week in the U.S., landing at the #2 spot and was held off the top spot by &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot;. &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot; eventually grossed $92 million worldwide, of which $59 million was from North America. The budget was estimated to be $40 million.

===Critical response===
&quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot; received generally negative reviews from critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 37% based on reviews from 130 critics, with a weighted average of 4.8/10 and the site&#x27;s consensus stating &quot;The plot for &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot; is more jingoistic than credible, and the overload of flashy visual tricks makes the action sequences resemble a video game.&quot; Metacritic has assigned the film an average score of 49 out of 100 based on 29 reviews from mainstream critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B+&quot; on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert gave the film 1½ stars out of four, likening it to a comedy: &quot;Its hero is so reckless and its villains so incompetent that it&#x27;s a showdown between a man begging to be shot, and an enemy that can&#x27;t hit the side of a Bosnian barn.&quot;

==Sequels==
&quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot; was followed by three direct-to-video Spiritual successors. &quot;Behind Enemy Lines II: Axis of Evil&quot; was released in 2006, &quot;Behind Enemy Lines: Colombia&quot; was released in 2009 (this film was co-produced by WWE Studios) and &quot;SEAL Team 8: Behind Enemy Lines&quot; was released in 2014.

===2017 television pilot===
The Fox network ordered a pilot episode of a series loosely based on the film in February 2017 for consideration as part of the network&#x27;s 2017–18 television season. It was ultimately canceled.

<text>Confetti are small pieces or streamers of paper, mylar, or metallic material which are usually thrown at celebrations, especially parades and weddings. The origins are from the Latin &quot;confectum&quot;, with &quot;confetti&quot; the plural of Italian &quot;confetto&quot;, small sweet. Modern paper confetti trace back to symbolic rituals of tossing grains and sweets during special occasions, traditional for numerous cultures throughout history as an ancient custom dating back to pagan times, but adapted from sweets and grains to paper through the centuries. Confetti are manufactured in multiple colors, and commercially available confetti come in many different shapes. A distinction is made between confetti and glitter; glitter is smaller than confetti (pieces usually no larger than 1 mm) and is universally shiny. Most table confetti is also shiny. While they are called metallic confetti they are actually metallized PVC. Most party supply stores carry paper and metallic confetti. Confetti are commonly used at social gatherings such as parties, weddings, and Bar Mitzvahs. The simplest confetti are simply shredded paper (see ticker-tape parade), and can be made with scissors or a paper shredder. Chads punched out of scrap paper are also common. A hole punch makes small round chads, and a ticket punch makes more elaborate chads. Most pieces of paper flats will flutter as tumblewings giving long flight times.

In the early 21st century the use of confetti as a cosmetic addition to trophy presentations at sporting events became increasingly common. In this case, larger strips of paper (typically measuring 20 mm × 60 mm) in colors appropriate to the team or celebration are used. For smaller volumes of confetti, ABS or PVC &quot;barrels&quot; are filled and the confetti is projected via a &quot;cannon&quot; (a small pressure vessel) using compressed air or carbon dioxide. For larger venues or volumes of confetti, a venturi air mover powered by carbon dioxide is used to propel significantly larger volumes of confetti greater distances.

==History==
Since the Middle Ages, in northern Italy it was common usage for the participants of carnival parades to throw objects at the crowd, mostly mud balls, eggs, coins or fruit. These traditions are still present in some towns in different forms, such as the &quot;Battle of the Oranges&quot; in Ivrea.

The throwing of objects at parades is well-documented in Milan from the 14th century. The nobles would throw candies and flowers during the parades, while dames threw eggshells filled with essences and perfumes. Lower-class people mocked the nobles by throwing rotten eggs, and battles among enemy factions or districts became common. In 1597, the city governor Juan Fernández de Velasco y Tovar imposed a ban on egg-throwing and &quot;squittaroli&quot; (spraying liquids in the street) along with other immoral behaviors. The custom disappeared for about a century, re-emerging in the 1700s in the form of thrown small candies, typically sugar-coated seeds. The seeds used were mostly coriander, a common plant in the area: the Italian name for confetti is &quot;coriandoli&quot;, from the name of the herb.

The candies were expensive, and the lower classes often used small chalk balls instead, called &quot;benis de gess&quot; (chalk candy). Those were officially defined as the only material allowed to be thrown during the parades in an edict by the Prefect of Milan in 1808, but the battles fought with them in the 1800s became too large and dangerous, with hundreds of people involved, leading to a ban of the chalk pellets. Some circumvented the ban by throwing balls of mud.

In 1875, an Italian businessman from Milan, Enrico Mangili, began selling paper confetti for use in the upcoming &quot;carnevale di Milano&quot;, the yearly parade held along the streets of the city. At that time, the province of Milan was one of the main hubs of silk manufacturing. Mangili begun collecting the small punched paper disks that were left as a byproduct from the production of the holed sheets used by the silkworm breeders as cage bedding, and selling them for profit. The new paper confetti was well received by the customers, being less harmful, cheaper and more entertaining than the alternatives, and their use quickly replaced previous customs in Milan and northern Italy.

&quot;Scientific American&quot; recorded that the throwing of paper confetti (in the form of plain shredded paper) occurred at the 1885 New Year&#x27;s Eve in Paris. Paper confetti became common in all of Europe within the next two decades (unlike ticker-tape parade, which never received as wide a diffusion as they did in the U.S.).

==Alternatives==

Some weddings use natural petal confetti. These are made from freeze-dried flower petals and are completely biodegradable. In fact, venues may now only allow these biodegradable versions to be used. Some wedding venues have decided that due to the mess and potential inconvenience caused by the use of confetti to ban its usage completely. One way that this restriction has been circumvented is to use soap bubbles in place of confetti.

==Etymology and Italian &quot;confetti&quot;==

The English word &quot;&quot; (to denote Jordan almonds) is adopted from the Italian confectionery of the same name, which was a small sweet traditionally thrown during carnivals. Also known as dragée or comfit, Italian &quot;confetti&quot; are almonds with a hard sugar coating; their name equates to French &quot;confit&quot;. The Italian word for paper confetti is &quot;&quot;, which refers to the coriander seeds originally contained within the sweet.

By tradition, the Italian &quot;confetti&quot; (sugar coated almonds) are given out at weddings (white coating) and baptisms (blue or pink coating, according to the sex of the newborn baby), or graduations (red coating), often wrapped in a small tulle bag as a gift to the guests. For a wedding, they are said to represent the hope that the new couple will have a fertile marriage. The British adapted the missiles to weddings (displacing the traditional grains or rice symbolising sexual fertility) at the end of the 19th century, using symbolic shreds of coloured paper rather than real sweets.

<text>The Church of Hawaiʻi, originally called the Hawaiian Reformed Catholic Church, was the state church and national church of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi from 1862 to 1893. It was the ecclesiastical province of the Anglican Communion in Hawaiʻi, which later merged into the American Episcopal Church during the establishment of the Republic of Hawaii.

==History==
As a young prince, King Kamehameha IV had visited England and was impressed by the rich ceremony of the Church of England, compared to the dour simplicity of the American missionaries who educated him as a child. His queen consort Queen Emma had a British grandfather and was brought up in a house of a British Anglican doctor. Their 1856 wedding ceremony included Anglican prayers but had to be performed by the Congregationalist minister.

In 1859, Emma wrote to Victoria of the United Kingdom to request a clergyman from the English church. The King&#x27;s foreign minister, Robert Crichton Wyllie, also made requests through diplomatic contacts. In 1860, Samuel Wilberforce suggested expanding the mission to include a bishop who could organize a new branch. William Ingraham Kip of the Episcopal Church in California also supported the idea, but the American Civil War prevented any help from them. The idea was approved by John Bird Sumner and British Foreign Secretary Lord John Russell. The first Bishop was Thomas Nettleship Staley, consecrated on December 15, 1861.

The sending of Staley caused friction with the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions even before he arrived in 1862; making him a bishop concerned the Congregationalists, who opposed any kind of religious hierarchy. Rufus Anderson, of the American Board, became a fierce critic, accusing him of ritualism. The officially chartered name of &quot;Hawaiian Reformed Catholic Church&quot; provoked criticism as &quot;papist&quot;. After Kamehameha IV died, an elaborate funeral service was held which was compared to a Pontifical High Mass. Staley was even attacked by American writer Mark Twain, and others whom he called &quot;Puritans&quot;.
The Church of Hawaiʻi became the official royal church, with land donated from the royal family&#x27;s holdings, not the government. Emma was baptized, followed by a young David Kalākaua who would later also become king. The Royal Mausoleum was built with a private chapel, which contrasted to the simple unadorned graveyards preferred by earlier missionaries. Observance of the holidays of Christmas and Good Friday was begun. Since Kamehameha IV had died on the feast of Saint Andrew, the first cathedral constructed in Hawaiʻi by his brother the new King Kamehameha V was called the Saint Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral. The cornerstone was laid in 1867, and it became the official residence of the bishop. Two associated schools were also started: Saint Andrew&#x27;s Priory School for Girls, and a boys&#x27; school named for Saint Alban, which eventually became part of Iolani School.

After the overthrow of the monarchy in 1893 and United States annexation in 1898, the Church of Hawaiʻi was dissolved and became the Episcopal Diocese of Hawaiʻi as territorial jurisdiction was transferred to the Episcopal Church in the United States of America.

<doc id="732860" wikidata="Q310916" url="?curid=732860" title="Iamblichus">
<text>Iamblichus ( ; ; Arabic: يَمْلِكُ, romanized: &quot;Yamlīkū;&quot; ; ) was a Arab Syrian neoplatonic philosopher. He determined a direction later taken by neoplatonism. Iamblichus was also the biographer of the Greek mystic, philosopher, and mathematician Pythagoras. In addition to his philosophical contributions, his is important for the study of the sophists because it preserved about ten pages of an otherwise unknown sophist known as the Anonymus Iamblichi.

== Life ==
According to the and Iamblichus&#x27; biographer, Eunapius, Iamblichus was born in Chalcis (later called Qinnašrīn) in Coele, now in northwest Syria. Iamblichus was descended from the Emesene dynasty. He initially studied under Anatolius of Laodicea and later studied under Porphyry, a pupil of Plotinus (the founder of neoplatonism). Iamblichus disagreed with Porphyry about theurgy, reportedly responding to Porphyry&#x27;s criticism of the practice in &quot;On the Mysteries of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Assyrians&quot;.

He returned to Coele Syria around 304 to found a school in Apamea (near Antioch), a city known for its neoplatonic philosophers. Iamblichus designed a curriculum for studying Plato and Aristotle, and wrote commentaries on the two which survive only in fragments. Pythagoras was his supreme authority, and he wrote the ten-volume &quot;Collection of Pythagorean Doctrines&quot; with extracts from several ancient philosophers; only the first four volumes and fragments of the fifth survive.

Iamblichus wrote the &quot;Exhortation to Philosophy&quot; in Apamea during the early fourth century. Considered a man of great culture and learning, he was renowned for his charity and self-denial and had a number of students. According to Johann Albert Fabricius, he died sometime before 333 during the reign of Constantine the Great.

== Philosophy ==
Iamblichus detailed Plotinus&#x27; neoplatonic formal divisions, applied Pythagorean number symbolism more systematically, and (influenced by other Asian systems) interpreted neoplatonic concepts mythically. Unlike Plotinus, who broke from platonic tradition by positing a separate soul, Iamblichus re-affirmed the soul&#x27;s embodiment in matter and believed that matter was as divine as the rest of the cosmos.

=== Cosmology and theology ===

Iamblichus placed the Monad at the head of his system, from which emanates the &quot;Nous&quot; (intellect, or demiurge) and the &quot;psyche&quot;. Plotinus represented the &quot;Nous&quot; as three stages: objective being, subjective life, and realized intellect. Iamblichus divided them into two spheres: intelligible (the objects of thought) and intellective (the domain of thought).

Iamblichus and Proclus may have introduced a third sphere between the two worlds, separating and uniting them. The identification of &quot;nous&quot; with the demiurge in the neoplatonic tradition was adopted and developed in Christian gnosticism. Augustine of Hippo follows Plotinus, identifying the &quot;nous&quot; with &quot;logos&quot; (the creative principle) as part of the Trinity.

Iamblichus multiplied the number of divine entities according to universal mathematical theorems. He conceived of gods, angels, demons and heroes: twelve heavenly gods (whose number increases to 36 or 360), 72 other gods proceeding from them, 21 chiefs and 42 nature-gods. His divine realm extends from the Monad to material nature, where the soul descends into matter and becomes embodied in human form. These superhuman beings influence natural events and communicate knowledge about the future, and are accessible with prayers and offerings. Iamblichus posited that numbers are independent, occupying a middle realm between the limited and unlimited. He believed that nature was bound by fate, differing from divine things which are not subject to fate and turn evil and imperfection to good ends; evil was generated accidentally in the conflict between the finite and the infinite.

== Works ==
Only a fraction of Iamblichus&#x27; books have survived; knowledge of his system is preserved in fragments of writings preserved by Stobaeus and others: notes by his successors (especially Proclus), his five extant books and sections of his work on Pythagoreanism. In addition to these, Proclus attributed to him the &quot;On the Mysteries of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Assyrians&quot;, also known as &quot;The Theurgia&quot;. Although stylistic and doctrinal differences exist between this book and Iamblichus&#x27; other works, it originated from his school at least. Iamblichus also completed a coherent polytheist theological system under the Egyptian pseudonym &quot;Abammon&quot;.

== Reception ==
Iamblichus was praised by his followers, and contemporaries credited him with miraculous powers. The Roman emperor Julian, not content with Eunapius&#x27; modest eulogy that Iamblichus was inferior to Porphyry only in style, regarded him as second only to Plato and said that he would give all the gold in Lydia for one of his letters. During the 15th- and 16th-century revival of interest in his philosophy, Iamblichus&#x27; name was rarely mentioned without the epithet &quot;divine&quot; or &quot;most divine&quot;.

<text>Iamblichus (; 165–180 AD) was an ancient Syrian Greek novelist. He was the author of the &quot;Babyloniaca&quot; (, , &#x27;Babylonian Stories&#x27;), a romance novel in Greek. If not the earliest, it was at least one of the first productions of this kind in Greek literature.

==Life==
Iamblichus was an Emesene who achieved wide prominence in the 2nd century. He describes himself as being &quot;descended from the ancient dynasts&quot;, i.e. the Sampsigeramids. Iamblichus had the knowledge of three languages: Assyrian, Babylonian and Greek.

Iamblichus was educated in Babylon, and didn&#x27;t become acquainted with the Greek language until later in his life. After having lived at Babylon for a number of years, he was taken prisoner and sold as a slave to a Syrian, who, however, appears to have set him free again. He is said to have acquired such a perfect knowledge of Greek that he even distinguished himself as a rhetorician. For a time, he lived in Armenia, when it was ruled by the Roman client king; his fellow Emesene and distant relative Sohaemus.

==The &quot;Babyloniaca&quot;==
Iamblichus&#x27;s novel was about two lovers, Rhodanes and Sinonis. Garmus, a legendary king of Babylon, forces Sinonis to marry him and throws Rhodanes into prison. The lovers manage to escape, and after many singular adventures, in which magic plays a considerable part, Garmus is overthrown by Rhodanes, who becomes king of Babylon.

According to the Suda, it consisted of 39 books, but Photios, who gives a tolerably full epitome of the work, mentions only 16. A perfect copy of the work in manuscript existed down to the year 1671, when it was destroyed by fire. A few fragments of the original work have been preserved. The epitome of Photios and the fragments are collected in Chardon de la Rochette&#x27;s &quot;Melanges de Critique et de Philologie&quot;, Vol. 1, pp. 18, 34 and 53, and in Franz Passow&#x27;s &quot;Corpus Erotic.&quot;, vol. i.; comp. Fabric. &quot;Bibl. Graec.&quot; vol. viii. p. 152; Gerardus Vossius, &quot;De Hist. Graec.&quot; p. 275, ed. Westermann.

<text>Faversham Abbey was a Cluniac style monastery immediately to the north-east of the town of Faversham, in north Kent, England.

== History ==
It was founded by King Stephen and his wife Matilda of Boulogne in 1148. A party of monks from Bermondsey Abbey provided the nucleus and the first abbot.

At the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Sir Thomas Cheney assigned the abbey to Thomas Arden and it was considerably destroyed in 1538. Thereafter the site of the abbey came into the possession of the Sondes family and now lies within the grounds of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School.

The Abbey was the burial place of King Stephen, Queen Matilda, and their eldest son, Eustace IV of Boulogne. Their bones were reportedly thrown into the nearby Faversham Creek when the abbey was demolished. Their empty tombs were unearthed in 1964 near what had been the centre of the choir. However, there is a canopy tomb with no contemporary inscription in the nearby Parish Church, where it is said that their bones were re-interred.

The Abbey was excavated in 1965 by a team led by the archaeologist Brian Philp. A full plan of the abbey was produced. At around in length, the abbey was shorter than Canterbury Cathedral, but longer than Rochester Cathedral. The cloister and monastic buildings were built on the northern side.

The abbey was built from a mix of chalk, flint, ragstone, greensand, and Caen stone. The roofing material appears to have been slate from south Devon with matches to materials obtained from sites near Modbury and Slapton Sands.

== Archaeology ==
In May, 2019 Kent Archaeological Field School uncovered long by wide Roman building at Abbey Farm. According to the Dr Paul Wilkinson, the building contained broken stone walls. The walls covered huge amounts of box flue tiles, which were used to direct hot air up the indoor walls, glazed terracotta floors, an untouched underfloor with hypocaust heating and tons of ceramic roof tiles. Although the plaster painted from these walls were mostly white, plaster walls coloured with green, red and yellow panels were found in the hot sauna room on the north side of the building. The building was divided into two zones of activity – a bath house and a room for agricultural activity.

<doc id="732873" wikidata="Q1859747" url="?curid=732873" title="Base rate fallacy">
<text>The base rate fallacy, also called base rate neglect or base rate bias, is a type of fallacy in which people tend to ignore the base rate (e.g., general prevalence) in favor of the individuating information (i.e., information pertaining only to a specific case). For example, if someone hears that a friend is very shy and quiet, they might think the friend is more likely to be a librarian than a salesperson. However, there are far more salespeople than librarians overall—hence making it more likely that their friend is actually a salesperson, even if a greater proportion of librarians fit the description of being shy and quiet. Base rate neglect is a specific form of the more general extension neglect.

It is also called the prosecutor&#x27;s fallacy or defense attorney&#x27;s fallacy when applied to the results of statistical tests (such as DNA tests) in the context of law proceedings. These terms were introduced by William C. Thompson and Edward Schumann in 1987, although it has been argued that their definition of the prosecutor&#x27;s fallacy extends to many additional invalid imputations of guilt or liability that are not analyzable as errors in base rates or Bayes&#x27;s theorem.

==False positive paradox==
An example of the base rate fallacy is the false positive paradox (also known as accuracy paradox). This paradox describes situations where there are more false positive test results than true positives (this means the classifier has a low precision). For example, if a facial recognition camera can identify wanted criminals 99% accurately, but analyzes 10,000 people a day, the high accuracy is outweighed by the number of tests; because of this, the program&#x27;s list of criminals will likely have far more innocents (false positives) than criminals (true positives) because there are far more innocents than criminals overall. The probability of a positive test result is determined not only by the accuracy of the test but also by the characteristics of the sampled population. The fundamental issue is that the far higher prevalence of true negatives means that the pool of people testing positively will be dominated by false positives, given that even a small fraction of the much larger [negative] group will produce a larger number of indicated positives than the larger fraction of the much smaller [positive] group.

When the prevalence, the proportion of those who have a given condition, is lower than the test&#x27;s false positive rate, even tests that have a very low risk of giving a false positive &quot;in an individual case&quot; will give more false than true positives &quot;overall&quot;.

It is especially counter-intuitive when interpreting a positive result in a test on a low-prevalence population after having dealt with positive results drawn from a high-prevalence population. If the false positive rate of the test is higher than the proportion of the &quot;new&quot; population with the condition, then a test administrator whose experience has been drawn from testing in a high-prevalence population may conclude from experience that a positive test result usually indicates a positive subject, when in fact a false positive is far more likely to have occurred.

==Examples==
===Example 1: Disease===
==== High-prevalence population ====

Imagine running an infectious disease test on a population &quot;A&quot; of 1,000 persons, of which 40% are infected. The test has a false positive rate of 5% (0.05) and a false negative rate of zero. The expected outcome of the 1,000 tests on population &quot;A&quot; would be:

:Infected and test indicates disease (true positive)
::1000 × = 400 people would receive a true positive
:Uninfected and test indicates disease (false positive)
::1000 × × 0.05 = 30 people would receive a false positive
:The remaining 570 tests are correctly negative.

So, in population &quot;A&quot;, a person receiving a positive test could be over 93% confident () that it correctly indicates infection.

====Low-prevalence population====

Now consider the same test applied to population &quot;B&quot;, of which only 2% are infected. The expected outcome of 1000 tests on population &quot;B&quot; would be:

:Infected and test indicates disease (true positive)
::1000 × = 20 people would receive a true positive
:Uninfected and test indicates disease (false positive)
::1000 × × 0.05 = 49 people would receive a false positive
:The remaining 931 tests are correctly negative.

In population &quot;B&quot;, only 20 of the 69 total people with a positive test result are actually infected. So, the probability of actually being infected after one is told that one is infected is only 29% () for a test that otherwise appears to be &quot;95% accurate&quot;.

A tester with experience of group &quot;A&quot; might find it a paradox that in group &quot;B&quot;, a result that had usually correctly indicated infection is now usually a false positive. The confusion of the posterior probability of infection with the prior probability of receiving a false positive is a natural error after receiving a health-threatening test result.

===Example 2: Drunk drivers===
Imagine that a group of police officers have breathalyzers displaying false drunkenness in 5% of the cases in which the driver is sober. However, the breathalyzers never fail to detect a truly drunk person. One in a thousand drivers is driving drunk. Suppose the police officers then stop a driver at random to administer a breathalyzer test. It indicates that the driver is drunk. No other information is known about them.

Many would estimate the probability that the driver is drunk as high as 95%, but the correct probability is about 2%.

An explanation for this is as follows: on average, for every 1,000 drivers tested,
* 1 driver is drunk, and it is 100% certain that for that driver there is a &quot;true&quot; positive test result, so there is 1 &quot;true&quot; positive test result
* 999 drivers are not drunk, and among those drivers there are 5% &quot;false&quot; positive test results, so there are 49.95 &quot;false&quot; positive test results
Therefore, the probability that any given driver among the 1 + 49.95 = 50.95 positive test results really is drunk is formula_1.

The validity of this result does, however, hinge on the validity of the initial assumption that the police officer stopped the driver truly at random, and not because of bad driving. If that or another non-arbitrary reason for stopping the driver was present, then the calculation also involves the probability of a drunk driver driving competently and a non-drunk driver driving (in-)competently.

More formally, the same probability of roughly 0.02 can be established using Bayes&#x27; theorem. The goal is to find the probability that the driver is drunk given that the breathalyzer indicated they are drunk, which can be represented as
:formula_2
where &quot;D&quot; means that the breathalyzer indicates that the driver is drunk. Using Bayes&#x27;s theorem,
:formula_3
The following information is known in this scenario: 
:formula_4
:formula_5
:formula_6 and
:formula_7
As can be seen from the formula, one needs &quot;p&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) for Bayes&#x27; theorem, which can be computed from the preceding values using the law of total probability:
:formula_8
which gives
:formula_9
Plugging these numbers into Bayes&#x27; theorem, one finds that
:formula_10
which is the precision of the test.

===Example 3: Terrorist identification===
In a city of 1 million inhabitants, let there be 100 terrorists and 999,900 non-terrorists. To simplify the example, it is assumed that all people present in the city are inhabitants. Thus, the base rate probability of a randomly selected inhabitant of the city being a terrorist is 0.0001, and the base rate probability of that same inhabitant being a non-terrorist is 0.9999. In an attempt to catch the terrorists, the city installs an alarm system with a surveillance camera and automatic facial recognition software.

The software has two failure rates of 1%:
* The false negative rate: If the camera scans a terrorist, a bell will ring 99% of the time, and it will fail to ring 1% of the time.
* The false positive rate: If the camera scans a non-terrorist, a bell will not ring 99% of the time, but it will ring 1% of the time.

Suppose now that an inhabitant triggers the alarm. Someone making the base rate fallacy would infer that there is a 99% probability that the detected person is a terrorist. Although the inference seems to make sense, it is actually bad reasoning, and a calculation below will show that the probability of a terrorist is actually near 1%, not near 99%.

The fallacy arises from confusing the natures of two different failure rates. The &#x27;number of non-bells per 100 terrorists&#x27; (P(¬B | T), or the probability that the bell fails to ring given the inhabitant is a terrorist) and the &#x27;number of non-terrorists per 100 bells&#x27; (P(¬T | B), or the probability that the inhabitant is a non-terrorist given the bell rings) are unrelated quantities; one does not necessarily equal—or even be close to—the other. To show this, consider what happens if an identical alarm system were set up in a second city with no terrorists at all. As in the first city, the alarm sounds for 1 out of every 100 non-terrorist inhabitants detected, but unlike in the first city, the alarm never sounds for a terrorist. Therefore, 100% of all occasions of the alarm sounding are for non-terrorists, but a false negative rate cannot even be calculated. The &#x27;number of non-terrorists per 100 bells&#x27; in that city is 100, yet P(T | B) = 0%. There is zero chance that a terrorist has been detected given the ringing of the bell.

Imagine that the first city&#x27;s entire population of one million people pass in front of the camera. About 99 of the 100 terrorists will trigger the alarm—and so will about 9,999 of the 999,900 non-terrorists. Therefore, about 10,098 people will trigger the alarm, among which about 99 will be terrorists. The probability that a person triggering the alarm actually is a terrorist is only about 99 in 10,098, which is less than 1% and very, very far below the initial guess of 99%.

The base rate fallacy is so misleading in this example because there are many more non-terrorists than terrorists, and the number of false positives (non-terrorists scanned as terrorists) is so much larger than the true positives (terrorists scanned as terrorists).

Multiple practitioners have argued that as the base rate of terrorism is extremely low, using data mining and predictive algorithms to identify terrorists cannot feasibly work due to the false positive paradox. Estimates of the number of false positives for each accurate result vary from over ten thousand to one billion; consequently, investigating each lead would be cost- and time-prohibitive. The level of accuracy required to make these models viable is likely unachievable. Foremost, the low base rate of terrorism also means there is a lack of data with which to make an accurate algorithm. Further, in the context of detecting terrorism false negatives are highly undesirable and thus must be minimised as much as possible; however, this requires increasing sensitivity at the cost of specificity, increasing false positives. It is also questionable whether the use of such models by law enforcement would meet the requisite burden of proof given that over 99% of results would be false positives.

===Example 4: biological testing of a suspect===
A crime is committed. Forensic analysis determines that the perpetrator has a certain blood type shared by 10% of the population. A suspect is arrested, and found to have that same blood type.

A prosecutor might charge the suspect with the crime on that basis alone, and claim at trial that the probability that the defendant is guilty is 90%.

However, this conclusion is only close to correct if the defendant was selected as the main suspect based on robust evidence discovered prior to the blood test and unrelated to it. Otherwise, the reasoning presented is flawed, as it overlooks the high prior probability (that is, prior to the blood test) that he is a random innocent person. Assume, for instance, that 1000 people live in the town where the crime occurred. This means that 100 people live there who have the perpetrator&#x27;s blood type, of whom only one is the true perpetrator; therefore, the true probability that the defendant is guilty – based only on the fact that his blood type matches that of the killer – is only 1%, far less than the 90% argued by the prosecutor.

The prosecutor&#x27;s fallacy involves assuming that the prior probability of a random match is equal to the probability that the defendant is innocent. When using it, a prosecutor questioning an expert witness may ask: &quot;The odds of finding this evidence on an innocent man are so small that the jury can safely disregard the possibility that this defendant is innocent, correct?&quot; The claim assumes that the probability that evidence is found on an innocent man is the same as the probability that a man is innocent given that evidence was found on him, which is not true. Whilst the former is usually small (10% in the previous example) due to good forensic evidence procedures, the latter (99% in that example) does not directly relate to it and will often be much higher, since, in fact, it depends on the likely quite high prior odds of the defendant being a random innocent person.

==Examples in law==
===O. J. Simpson trial===
O. J. Simpson was tried and acquitted in 1995 for the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.

Crime scene blood matched Simpson&#x27;s with characteristics shared by 1 in 400 people. However, the defense argued that the number of people from Los Angeles matching the sample could fill a football stadium and that the figure of 1 in 400 was useless. It would have been incorrect, and an example of prosecutor&#x27;s fallacy, to rely solely on the &quot;1 in 400&quot; figure to deduce that a given person matching the sample would be likely to be the culprit.

In the same trial, the prosecution presented evidence that Simpson had been violent toward his wife. The defense argued that there was only one woman murdered for every 2500 women who were subjected to spousal abuse, and that any history of Simpson being violent toward his wife was irrelevant to the trial. However, the reasoning behind the defense&#x27;s calculation was fallacious. According to author Gerd Gigerenzer, the correct probability requires additional context: Simpson&#x27;s wife had not only been subjected to domestic violence, but rather subjected to domestic violence (by Simpson) killed (by someone). Gigerenzer writes &quot;the chances that a batterer actually murdered his partner, given that she has been killed, is about 8 in 9 or approximately 90%&quot;. While most cases of spousal abuse do not end in murder, most cases of murder where there is a history of spousal abuse were committed by the spouse.

===Sally Clark case===
Sally Clark, a British woman, was accused in 1998 of having killed her first child at 11 weeks of age and then her second child at 8 weeks of age. The prosecution had expert witness Sir Roy Meadow, a professor and consultant paediatrician, testify that the probability of two children in the same family dying from SIDS is about 1 in 73 million. That was much less frequent than the actual rate measured in historical data Meadow estimated it from single-SIDS death data, and the assumption that the probability of such deaths should be uncorrelated between infants.

Meadow acknowledged that 1-in-73 million is not an impossibility, but argued that such accidents would happen &quot;once every hundred years&quot; and that, in a country of 15 million 2-child families, it is vastly more likely that the double-deaths are due to Münchausen syndrome by proxy than to such a rare accident. However, there is good reason to suppose that the likelihood of a death from SIDS in a family is significantly greater if a previous child has already died in these circumstances, (a genetic predisposition to SIDS is likely to invalidate that assumed statistical independence) making some families more susceptible to SIDS and the error an outcome of the ecological fallacy. The likelihood of two SIDS deaths in the same family cannot be soundly estimated by squaring the likelihood of a single such death in all otherwise similar families.

The 1-in-73 million figure greatly underestimated the chance of two successive accidents, but even if that assessment were accurate, the court seems to have missed the fact that the 1-in-73 million number meant nothing on its own. As an &quot;a priori&quot; probability, it should have been weighed against the &quot;a priori&quot; probabilities of the alternatives. Given that two deaths had occurred, one of the following explanations must be true, and all of them are &quot;a priori&quot; extremely improbable:
# Two successive deaths in the same family, both by SIDS
# Double homicide (the prosecution&#x27;s case)
# Other possibilities (including one homicide and one case of SIDS)

It is unclear whether an estimate of the probability for the second possibility was ever proposed during the trial, or whether the comparison of the first two probabilities was understood to be the key estimate to make in the statistical analysis assessing the prosecution&#x27;s case against the case for innocence.

Clark was convicted in 1999, resulting in a press release by the Royal Statistical Society which pointed out the mistakes.

In 2002, Ray Hill (a mathematics professor at Salford) attempted to accurately compare the chances of these two possible explanations; he concluded that successive accidents are between 4.5 and 9 times more likely than are successive murders, so that the &quot;a priori&quot; odds of Clark&#x27;s guilt were between 4.5 to 1 and 9 to 1 against.

After the court found that the forensic pathologist who had examined both babies had withheld exculpatory evidence, a higher court later quashed Clark&#x27;s conviction, on 29 January 2003.

==Findings in psychology==
In experiments, people have been found to prefer individuating information over general information when the former is available.

In some experiments, students were asked to estimate the grade point averages (GPAs) of hypothetical students. When given relevant statistics about GPA distribution, students tended to ignore them if given descriptive information about the particular student even if the new descriptive information was obviously of little or no relevance to school performance. This finding has been used to argue that interviews are an unnecessary part of the college admissions process because interviewers are unable to pick successful candidates better than basic statistics.

Psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky attempted to explain this finding in terms of a simple rule or &quot;heuristic&quot; called representativeness. They argued that many judgments relating to likelihood, or to cause and effect, are based on how representative one thing is of another, or of a category. Kahneman considers base rate neglect to be a specific form of extension neglect. Richard Nisbett has argued that some attributional biases like the fundamental attribution error are instances of the base rate fallacy: people do not use the &quot;consensus information&quot; (the &quot;base rate&quot;) about how others behaved in similar situations and instead prefer simpler dispositional attributions.

There is considerable debate in psychology on the conditions under which people do or do not appreciate base rate information. Researchers in the heuristics-and-biases program have stressed empirical findings showing that people tend to ignore base rates and make inferences that violate certain norms of probabilistic reasoning, such as Bayes&#x27; theorem. The conclusion drawn from this line of research was that human probabilistic thinking is fundamentally flawed and error-prone. Other researchers have emphasized the link between cognitive processes and information formats, arguing that such conclusions are not generally warranted.

Consider again Example 2 from above. The required inference is to estimate the (posterior) probability that a (randomly picked) driver is drunk, given that the breathalyzer test is positive. Formally, this probability can be calculated using Bayes&#x27; theorem, as shown above. However, there are different ways of presenting the relevant information. Consider the following, formally equivalent variant of the problem:

:  1 out of 1000 drivers are driving drunk. The breathalyzers never fail to detect a truly drunk person. For 50 out of the 999 drivers who are not drunk the breathalyzer falsely displays drunkenness. Suppose the policemen then stop a driver at random, and force them to take a breathalyzer test. It indicates that they are drunk. No other information is known about them. Estimate the probability the driver is really drunk.

In this case, the relevant numerical information—&quot;p&quot;(drunk), &quot;p&quot;(&quot;D&quot; | drunk), &quot;p&quot;(&quot;D&quot; | sober)—is presented in terms of natural frequencies with respect to a certain reference class (see reference class problem). Empirical studies show that people&#x27;s inferences correspond more closely to Bayes&#x27; rule when information is presented this way, helping to overcome base-rate neglect in laypeople and experts. As a consequence, organizations like the Cochrane Collaboration recommend using this kind of format for communicating health statistics. Teaching people to translate these kinds of Bayesian reasoning problems into natural frequency formats is more effective than merely teaching them to plug probabilities (or percentages) into Bayes&#x27; theorem. It has also been shown that graphical representations of natural frequencies (e.g., icon arrays, hypothetical outcome plots) help people to make better inferences.

One important reason why natural frequency formats are helpful is that this information format facilitates the required inference because it simplifies the necessary calculations. This can be seen when using an alternative way of computing the required probability &quot;p&quot;(drunk|&quot;D&quot;):

:formula_11

where &quot;N&quot;(drunk ∩ &quot;D&quot;) denotes the number of drivers that are drunk and get a positive breathalyzer result, and &quot;N&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) denotes the total number of cases with a positive breathalyzer result. The equivalence of this equation to the above one follows from the axioms of probability theory, according to which &quot;N&quot;(drunk ∩ &quot;D&quot;) = &quot;N&quot; × &quot;p&quot; (&quot;D&quot; | drunk) × &quot;p&quot; (drunk). Importantly, although this equation is formally equivalent to Bayes&#x27; rule, it is not psychologically equivalent. Using natural frequencies simplifies the inference because the required mathematical operation can be performed on natural numbers, instead of normalized fractions (i.e., probabilities), because it makes the high number of false positives more transparent, and because natural frequencies exhibit a &quot;nested-set structure&quot;.

Not every frequency format facilitates Bayesian reasoning. Natural frequencies refer to frequency information that results from &quot;natural sampling&quot;, which preserves base rate information (e.g., number of drunken drivers when taking a random sample of drivers). This is different from &quot;systematic sampling&quot;, in which base rates are fixed &quot;a priori&quot; (e.g., in scientific experiments). In the latter case it is not possible to infer the posterior probability &quot;p&quot;(drunk | positive test) from comparing the number of drivers who are drunk and test positive compared to the total number of people who get a positive breathalyzer result, because base rate information is not preserved and must be explicitly re-introduced using Bayes&#x27; theorem.

<doc id="732898" wikidata="Q526545" url="?curid=732898" title="Dan Swanö">
<text>Dan-Erland Swanö (born 10 March 1973), also known as Dan &quot;The Man&quot; Swanö, is a Swedish musician and record producer who is currently the vocalist, guitarist, ex-bassist and ex-drummer for the band Nightingale, lately vocalist, keyboardist and drummer for the band Witherscape, as well as the owner of Unisound. He achieved fame as the vocalist and songwriter of progressive death metal band Edge of Sanity.

As a multi-instrumentalist he is regarded as influential in the underground melodic death metal, black metal, progressive metal, death metal, progressive rock, and power metal communities. He is known for his progressive rock-influenced songwriting style and his frequent use of both clean and growled vocals.

==Career==
Swanö has fronted a number of bands, including Edge of Sanity, Brejn Dedd, Unicorn, Infestdead and Route Nine. He has also been a member of Katatonia and Ribspreader, as well as playing drums and lead guitar in death metal band Bloodbath.

Swanö also participated in Steel, a one-off power metal project from Sweden that featured him and members of Opeth. Started in 1996, this collaboration emerged during the recording sessions for Opeth&#x27;s &quot;Morningrise&quot; album. During a jam session, when the band were soundchecking the drums, they hit upon an idea to record a short piece for fun, entitled &quot;Guitars and Metal&quot;. This gave birth to Steel. Subsequently, they were asked to record more songs, and when they did, the songs which were originally meant for a demo, actually appeared on a limited picture 7-inch EP titled &quot;Heavy Metal Machine&quot;, released by Near Dark Productions. To this date, it remains their sole record. Featuring only two songs, &quot;Heavy Metal Machine&quot; sounds very much like a typical 1980s power metal band, with high-pitched vocals, shredding solos, pounding bass lines and 1980s-style sound effects (police sirens, etc.). However, the record is not meant to be taken as a serious power metal attempt, explaining Swanö&#x27;s extremely high-pitched vocals. As a limited release, &quot;Heavy Metal Machine&quot; remains a collectors&#x27; item and is hard to come by.

He has also contributed his vocal talents to Arjen Lucassen&#x27;s Star One project. The two musicians are good friends, with Lucassen contributing guitar parts to Swanö&#x27;s Nightingale project. Swanö can also be heard on the albums &quot;Theli&quot; and &quot;A&#x27;arab Zaraq – Lucid Dreaming&quot; by the symphonic metal band Therion. He was a producer and contributing writer of the band Diabolical Masquerade, the now-defunct solo avant-garde black metal band of Anders Nyström a.k.a. Blakkheim (Katatonia, Bloodbath, ex-Bewitched). He also contributed some guitar solos, backing vocals on various Diabolical Masquerade albums, and played the drums on the album &quot;Nightwork&quot;. He also produced and played the keyboards on the &quot;Memories from Nothing&quot; album by Swedish rock band Another Life, released on Vic Records.

Swanö has also released a solo progressive death metal album entitled &quot;Moontower&quot;, on which he plays all instruments (guitar, bass, drums, keyboard) as well as providing all the vocal work.

In July 2007, he auditioned to be lead singer for the Israeli project Amaseffer but lost the part to Mats Levén.

During 2009, Swanö re-activated Odyssey, this time performing all instruments by himself. Swanö recorded seven of his all-time favourite songs which was released in November 2010 on the album &quot;Reinventing the Past&quot;, together with the three 1999 tracks as a bonus on Vic Records. His brother Dag played guest lead guitar on the song &quot;Gypsy&quot;, a Uriah Heep cover.

In 2013, Swanö released with his new project Witherscape the full studio album &quot;The Inheritance&quot;, with Ragnar Widerberg as co-member, and the collaboration of, amongst other guest musicians, Novembers Doom&#x27;s founder Paul Kuhr. It was followed a year after by the EP &quot;The New Tomorrow&quot;. In 2016, the full studio album &quot;The Northern Sanctuary&quot; was released, via Century Media Records like its predecessors, featuring once again Paul Kuhr.

Swanö has a diverse vocal register, encompassing many styles, which include death growls; clean, melodic singing with a warm tone; dark gothic vocals; and thrash shouting.
As a peculiarity, he is a left-handed guitarist, but plays on right-handed guitars without reversing the strings.

In December 2020 Swanö was a guest on episode 8 of the podcast &quot;Wir und ELANE&quot;, hosted by members of the German band Elane. He spoke about several band experiences, the creation process of the first Nightingale album and the project which was called &quot;Second Sky&quot;.

===Unisound Studio===
Unisound Studio (also Unisound Recordings or Gorysound Studio) is a recording studio owned and operated by Dan Swanö. It used to be in Finspång, Sweden, but was closed down in around 2001 because of his family. The studio was later relocated into Swanö&#x27;s home in Örebro.

==Family and work==

Despite the large amount of releases to his name, Swanö worked full-time in a music store (&quot;Musikbörsen&quot;) in Örebro, near his home in Sweden, rarely doing live performances with any of his bands. He has an older brother, Dag, who plays guitars and keyboards in Nightingale, formerly under the name of &quot;Tom Nouga&quot;.

<text>55 Pandora is a fairly large and very bright asteroid in the asteroid belt. Pandora was discovered by American astronomer and Catholic priest George Mary Searle on September 10, 1858, from the Dudley Observatory near Albany, NY. It was his first and only asteroid discovery.

It is named after Pandora, the first woman in Greek mythology, who unwisely opened a box that released evil into the world. The name was apparently chosen by Blandina Dudley, widow of the founder of the Dudley Observatory, who had been involved in an acrimonious dispute with astronomer B. A. Gould. Gould felt that the name had an &quot;apt significance&quot;. The asteroid shares its name with Pandora, a moon of Saturn.

This object is orbiting the Sun with a period of 4.58 years, a semimajor axis of , and an eccentricity of 0.14. Its orbital plane lies at an angle of 7.2° to the plane of the ecliptic. Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Rozhen Observatory in Bulgaria during 2010 gave a light curve with a period of 4.7992 hours and a brightness variation of &quot;Δm&quot;=0.22 mag. This is consistent with a period of 4.804 hours and an amplitude of 0.24 obtained during a 1977 study. It has a cross-sectional size of .

<doc id="732906" wikidata="Q2411812" url="?curid=732906" title="The Gumps">
<text>The Gumps is a comic strip about a middle-class family. It was created by Sidney Smith in 1917, launching a 42-year run in newspapers from February 12, 1917, until October 17, 1959.

According to a 1937 issue of &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;The Gumps&quot; was inspired by Andy Wheat, a real-life person Smith met through his brother. &quot;Born forty-seven years ago [i.e., in 1890] in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, Andy Wheat acquired his unusual physiognomy as the result of an infection following the extraction of a tooth, which eventually necessitated the removal of his entire lower jaw. Through Dr. Thomas Smith of Bloomingdale, Illinois, a dentist and a brother of Sidney Smith, Wheat met the cartoonist, who saw in him an ideal comic character. Wheat subsequently had his surname legally changed to &quot;Gump&quot; to match the cartoon character. His wife&#x27;s name is Min, and he has two children, Chester and Goliath, now living in San Francisco, and an Uncle Bim who lives in Georgia. Gump&#x27;s home is in Tucson, Arizona, but he also has a farm near his birthplace in Mississippi.&quot;

==Characters and story==
The Gumps were utterly ordinary: chinless, bombastic blowhard Andy Gump (short for Andrew), who is henpecked by his wife, Min (short for Minerva); their sons Chester and baby Goliath (plus an unnamed daughter in college and an unnamed son in the Navy); wealthy Uncle Bim; and their annoying maid Tilda. They had a cat named Hope and a dog named Buck. The idea was envisioned by Joseph Patterson, editor and publisher of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, who was important in the early histories of &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; and other long-run comic strips. Patterson referred to the masses as &quot;gumps&quot; and thought a strip about the domestic lives of ordinary people and their ordinary activities would appeal to the average American newspaper reader. He hired Smith to write and draw the strip, and it was Smith who breathed life into the characters. Smith was the first cartoonist to kill off a regular character: His May 1929 storyline about the death of Mary Gold caused a national sensation.

The Sunday page also included several toppers over the course of the run: &quot;Old Doc Yak&quot; (Dec 7, 1930 – Feb 25, 1934), &quot;Cousin Juniper&quot; (Jan 2, 1944–1955) and &quot;Grandpa Noah&quot; (1955).

==Debut==
&quot;The Gumps&quot; made its debut in an unusual way. Cartoonist Sidney Smith had previously drawn and written &quot;Old Doc Yak&quot;, a talking-animal strip that sustained only a brief run. The very last &quot;Old Doc Yak&quot; strip depicted Yak and his family moving out of their house, while wondering who might move into the house next. On Thursday, February 8, 1917, the last panel showed only the empty house. On Monday, February 12, 1917, after the Gumps were introduced in the space formerly occupied by &quot;Old Doc Yak&quot;, they moved into the house formerly occupied by the Yak family. (&quot;Old Doc Yak&quot; would reappear as a topper for &quot;The Gumps&quot; Sunday page from 1930 to 1934.)

&quot;The Gumps&quot; had a key role in the rise of syndication when Robert R. McCormick and Patterson, who had both been publishing the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; since 1914, planned to launch a tabloid in New York, as comics historian Coulton Waugh explained:

==Films==
As one of the earliest continuity strips, &quot;The Gumps&quot; was extremely popular, with newspaper readers anxiously following the convoluted storylines. By 1919, this popularity prompted an interest in film adaptations, and in 1920–21, with writing credited to Smith, animation director Wallace A. Carlson produced and directed more than 50 animated shorts, some no longer than two minutes, for distribution through Paramount.

Between 1923 and 1928, Universal Pictures produced at least four dozen &quot;Gumps&quot; two-reel comedies starring Joe Murphy (1877–1961), one of the original Keystone Cops, as Andy Gump, Fay Tincher as Min and Jack Morgan as Chester. Many of these shorts were directed by Norman Taurog, later famed as the leading director of Elvis Presley movies.

In the comic strip, Sidney Smith had Andy run for Congress in 1922 and for President in 1924 and in practically every succeeding election, one of the first of many comic strip and cartoon characters to run for office. In 1924, Smith wrote his characters into a novel, &quot;Andy Gump: His Life Story&quot;, published in Chicago by Reilly &amp; Lee. In 1929, when Smith killed off Mary Gold, she was the first major comic strip character to die, and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; had to hire extra staff to deal with the constant phone calls and letters from stunned readers.

The strip and its merchandising (toys, games, a popular song, playing cards, food products) made Smith a wealthy man. On his way home from signing a $150,000 a year contract in 1935, he crashed his new Rolls-Royce and died. Patterson replaced Smith with sports cartoonist Gus Edson. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, when actor Martin Landau was a cartoonist, he worked as Edson&#x27;s assistant on &quot;The Gumps&quot;, eventually drawing the Sunday strips for Edson.

==Radio==

&quot;The Gumps&quot; launched a craze for continuity strips in newspapers. It also influenced radio and television programming. Radio/TV sitcoms and serialized dramas can all be traced back to &quot;The Gumps&quot;, as detailed by broadcast historian Elizabeth McLeod in the &quot;Andy Gump to Andy Brown&quot; section of her popular culture essay, and her book, &quot;The Original Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy: Freeman Gosden, Charles Correll, and the 1928–43 Radio Serial&quot; (McFarland, 2005).

At the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;&#x27;s radio station WGN, Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll signed on as staffers in 1925. WGN executive Ben McCanna believed that a dramatic serial could work on radio just as it did in newspapers. &quot;The Gumps&quot; first aired on WGN in 1931, then moved to CBS Radio for a four-year run (1934–1937), produced and directed by Himan Brown with scripts by Irwin Shaw.

In the early programs, Jack Boyle portrayed Andy Gump with Dorothy Denvir as Min, Charles Flynn as their son Chester and Bess Flynn, born 1899 in Tama, Iowa, as Tilda the maid. Flynn scripted for soap operas, including &quot;Bachelor&#x27;s Children&quot;, &quot;Martha Webster&quot; and &quot;We, the Abbotts&quot;, and she also portrayed the title role on &quot;Martha Webster&quot;. In 1935, Wilmer Walter played Andy Gump with Agnes Moorehead portraying Min during the last two years of the series when Lester Jay and Jackie Kelk were heard as Chester.

==Reprints==

Herb Galewitz assembled a selective compilation of the comic strips for the book, &quot;Sidney Smith&#x27;s The Gumps&quot;, published in 1974 by Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons. However, the strips in this book were assembled in a slipshod manner with no apparent restoration.

In 2012, IDW&#x27;s imprint The Library of American Comics announced a new series reprinting daily strips, in the &quot;LoAC Essentials&quot;. A &quot;Gumps&quot; volume titled &quot;The Saga of Mary Gold&quot; (1928–29) was published in March 2013.

==Tributes==
A gift from the &quot;Tribune&quot; management to Smith was a large statue of Andy Gump, which stood on Smith&#x27;s Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, estate. After Smith died in 1935, the statue was moved to a city park. In 1943, the statue was acquired by the city of Lake Geneva, but it was destroyed in 1967 during a drunken riot. It was replaced with a new statue, which was stolen in 1989 and again replaced. A plaque honoring Smith was also stolen from Lake Geneva in 1952, but it was later found. The statue is currently on display at the Lake Geneva Museum.

Hockey great Gump Worsley, born Lorne Worsley, was nicknamed for his resemblance to Andy Gump.

Jazz musician Min Leibrook, born Wilford Leibrook, received his nickname from Andy Gump&#x27;s wife, Min.

The town of Bim, West Virginia is named for Uncle Bim Gump.

A bunker on the 16th hole of the Hinsdale Golf Club in Clarendon Hills, IL is shaped in the likeness of Andy Gump.

The surgical removal of the mandible can result in a dysmorphism referred to as the &quot;Andy Gump deformity&quot; due to his character design apparently lacking a jaw.

<text>56 Melete is a large and dark main belt asteroid. It is a rather unusual P-type asteroid, probably composed of organic rich silicates, carbon and anhydrous silicates, with possible internal water ice. The asteroid orbits the Sun with a period of 4.18 years.

Melete was discovered by Hermann Goldschmidt from his balcony in Paris, on September 9, 1857. Its orbit was computed by E. Schubert, who named it after Melete, the Muse of meditation in Greek mythology. It was originally confused for 41 Daphne before it was confirmed not to be by its second sighting on August 27, 1871. In 1861, the brightness of 56 Melete was shown to vary by German astronomer Friedrich Tietjen.

Melete has been studied by radar. Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado Springs, Colorado in 2007 gave a light curve with a period of 18.151 ± 0.002 hours and a brightness variation of 0.15 ± 0.02 in magnitude. This result is in agreement with a period of 18.1 hours independently reported in 1993 and 2007.

To date, two stellar occultations by Melete have been observed successfully (in 1997 and again in 2002).

<text>Henry Grantland Rice (November 1, 1880 – July 13, 1954) was an American sportswriter known for his elegant prose. His writing was published in newspapers around the country and broadcast on the radio.

==Early life and education==

Rice was born in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, the son of Bolling Hendon Rice, a cotton dealer, and Mary Beulah (née Grantland) Rice. His grandfather Major H. W. Rice was a Confederate veteran of the American Civil War.

Rice attended Montgomery Bell Academy and Vanderbilt University in Nashville, where he was a member of the football team for three years, a shortstop on the baseball team, a brother in the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, and graduated with a BA degree in 1901 in classics. On the football team, he lettered in the year of 1899 as an end and averaged two injuries a year. On the baseball team, he was captain in 1901.

==Sportswriter==
In 1907, Rice saw what he would call the greatest thrill he ever witnessed in his years of watching sports during the Sewanee–Vanderbilt football game: the catch by Vanderbilt center Stein Stone, on a double-pass play then thrown near the end zone by Bob Blake to set up the touchdown run by Honus Craig that beat Sewanee at the very end for the SIAA championship. Vanderbilt coach Dan McGugin in &quot;Spalding&#x27;s Football Guide&quot;″s summation of the season in the SIAA wrote, &quot;The standing. First, Vanderbilt; second, Sewanee, a mighty good second;&quot; and that Aubrey Lanier &quot;came near winning the Vanderbilt game by his brilliant dashes after receiving punts.&quot; Rice coached the 1908 Vanderbilt baseball team.

Rice was an advocate for the emerging game of golf in the United States. He became interested in the sport in 1909 while covering the Southern Amateur at the Nashville Golf Club. It was not his first golf event, but it was the one that seemed to pull him toward the game.

After taking early jobs with the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot; and the &quot;Cleveland News&quot;, he later became a sportswriter for the &quot;Nashville Tennessean&quot;. The job at the &quot;Tennessean&quot; was given to him by former Sewanee Tigers coach Billy Suter, who coached baseball teams against which Rice played while at Vanderbilt. Afterwards he obtained a series of prestigious jobs with major newspapers in the northeastern United States. In 1914 he began his Sportlight column in the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;. He also provided monthly Grantland Rice Sportlights as part of Paramount newsreels from 1925 to 1954. He is best known for being the successor to Walter Camp in the selection of College Football All-America Teams beginning in 1925, and for being the writer who dubbed the great backfield of the 1924 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team the &quot;Four Horsemen&quot; of Notre Dame. A Biblical reference to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, this famous account was published in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; on October 18, describing the Notre Dame vs. Army game played at the Polo Grounds in New York City:

The passage added great import to the event described and elevated it to a level far beyond that of a mere football game. This passage, although famous, is far from atypical, as Rice&#x27;s writing tended to be of an &quot;inspirational&quot; or &quot;heroic&quot; style, raising games to the level of ancient combat and their heroes to the status of demigods. He became even better known after his columns were nationally syndicated beginning in 1930, and became known as the &quot;Dean of American Sports Writers&quot;. He and his writing are among the reasons that the 1920s in the United States are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Golden Age of Sports&quot;. Rice&#x27;s all-time All-America backfield was Jim Thorpe, Red Grange, Ken Strong, and Ernie Nevers.

His sense of honor can be seen in his own actions. Before leaving for service in World War I, he entrusted his entire fortune, about $75,000 (the equivalent of around $1.4 million today), to a friend. On his return from the war, Rice discovered that his friend had lost all the money in bad investments, and then had committed suicide. Rice accepted the blame for putting &quot;that much temptation&quot; in his friend&#x27;s way. Rice then made monthly contributions to the man&#x27;s widow throughout his life.

According to author Mark Inabinett in his 1994 work, &quot;Grantland Rice and His Heroes: The Sportswriter as Mythmaker in the 1920s&quot;, Rice very consciously set out to make heroes of sports figures who impressed him, most notably Jack Dempsey, Babe Ruth, Bobby Jones, Bill Tilden, Red Grange, Babe Didrikson, and Knute Rockne. Unlike many writers of his era, Rice defended the right of football players such as Grange, and tennis players such as Tilden, to make a living as professionals, but he also decried the warping influence of big money in sports, once writing in his column:

Rice authored a book of poetry, &quot;Songs of the Stalwart&quot;, which was published in 1917 by D. Appleton and Company of New York.

==Personal life==
Rice married Fannie Katherine Hollis on April 11, 1906; they had one child, the actress Florence Rice. Rice died at the age 73 on July 13, 1954, following a stroke. He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City.

==Legacy==

In 1951, in recognition of Rice&#x27;s 50 years in journalism, an anonymous donor contributed $50,000 to establish the Grantland Rice Fellowship in Journalism with The New York Community Trust. In 1954, the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) established the Grantland Rice Trophy, an annual award presented (from 1954 to 2013) to the college football team recognized by the FWAA as the national champions. The Grantland Rice Bowl, an annual college football bowl game held from 1964 to 1977, was named in his honor, as was the Grantland Rice Award given to the winner. Rice was posthumously awarded the 1966 J. G. Taylor Spink Award by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America. The award, presented the following year at the annual induction ceremony at the Baseball Hall of Fame, is given for &quot;meritorious contributions to baseball writing&quot;.

At Vanderbilt, a four-year scholarship named for Rice and former colleague and fellow Vanderbilt alumnus Fred Russell is awarded each year to an incoming first-year student who intends to pursue a career in sportswriting. Recipients of the Fred Russell–Grantland Rice Sportswriting Scholarship include author and humorist Roy Blount Jr.; Skip Bayless of Fox Sports and &quot;New York Times&quot; best-selling author, Andrew Maraniss. The press box in Vanderbilt Stadium at Vanderbilt University is dedicated to Rice and named after Rice&#x27;s protégé, Fred Russell. For many years, a portion of one floor of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism was designated the &quot;Grantland Rice Suite&quot;. Grantland Avenue in his hometown of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, was named in his honor.

Rice was mentioned in an &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; episode entitled &quot;The Camping Trip&quot;, and was portrayed by actor Lane Smith, also a native of Tennessee, in &quot;The Legend of Bagger Vance&quot;. On June 8, 2011, ESPN&#x27;s Bill Simmons launched a sports and popular culture website titled Grantland, a name intended to honor Rice&#x27;s legacy. It operated for a little more than four years until being shuttered by ESPN on October 30, 2015, several months after Simmons&#x27;s departure.

<text>Mazda makes both piston and Wankel &quot;rotary&quot; engines. This page summarizes the various engine families and variations.

==Piston engines==

Although Mazda is well known for their Wankel &quot;rotary&quot; engines, the company has been manufacturing piston engines since the earliest years of the Toyo Kogyo company. Early on, they produced overhead camshaft, aluminum blocks, and an innovative block containing both the engine and transmission in one unit. This section summarizes piston engine developments. Note that only Mazda&#x27;s V-twin, Inline-4, and V6 configurations have made it to market. The company has engineered and completed a W12 engine by 1990 for use in their proposed Amati luxury car brand. Due to financial hardships during that time, the luxury brand was abandoned as well as those two engines.

===V-twin===
Like several other Japanese makers, Mazda produced V-twin engines for their three-wheeled delivery vehicles of the 1950s. These were also used in some of the tiny keicars of the 1960s. These were essentially motorcycle engines, and were largely superseded by water-cooled straight-4 engines in a few years, except for in the Mazda R360 which remained in production until 1969 especially for the handicapped.

* V-twin - 356 cc—1.4 L air-cooled V2 (1958-1969)

===Inline-4===
Mazda&#x27;s strength since the 1960s has been in its line of Inline-4 engines. Beginning with a tiny 358 cc kei car engine, one of the smallest ever made, Mazda continues to this day to be a leading developer of this type of engine. 
* OHV engine – 358 cc–1.2 L OHV I4 (1961–1974)
* xC engine – 1.0 L–2.0 L SOHC I4 (1965–1983)
* E engine – 1.1 L–1.5 L SOHC I4 (1980–1987)
* F engine – 1.6 L–2.2 L SOHC/DOHC I4 (1977–2002)
* RF engine (including MZR-CD) – Diesel - 1983 - 2009
* G engine – 2.5 L–2.6 L I4 (1989–1999)
* B engine – 1.1 L–1.8 L SOHC/DOHC I4 (1985–2005)
* Mazda Z engine (MZR) – 1.3 L–1.6 L DOHC I4 (1995–2011)
* Mazda L engine (MZR) – 1.8 L–2.5 L DOHC I4 (2002–2011)
* Japan Kei car engine – Suzuki I4
* Diesel – 1.4 L–4.6 L I4
* YF – Ford 2.0 L I4 for Mazda Tribute
* SkyActiv-G – 1.3/1.5/2.0 L I4 (2011–present)
* SkyActiv-G – 2.5 L I4 (2013–present)
* SkyActiv-D – Twin Turbo Diesel - 2.2 L I4 (2012–present)
* SkyActiv-X – 2.0 L I4 (2019–present)

===V6===
Mazda has created three families of in-house V6 engines. As of 2000, they build and use the Ford Duratec V6 design.

* J engine – 2.0 L–3.0 L 60° V6 (–1995)
* K engine – 1.8 L–2.5 L 60° V6
* Diesel V6 – 4.1 L–5.5 L ZB/ZC V6
* AJ/MZI – 2.5 L and 3.0 L V6 - The Mazda version of the Ford Duratec DOHC V6. The 3.5 L MZI is the Ford Cyclone engine.

==Wankel engines==
Mazda is the only producer of successful Wankel engines, positioning them as a prime sports car powerplant. All of Mazda&#x27;s Wankels are based on their first design of the 1960s, though there have been significant developments over the four decades. After Mazda RX-8 production ceased in 2013, Mazda has carried on with testing prototypes to re-introduce the rotary as part of the &quot;SkyActiv&quot; lineup, dubbed SkyActiv R, displacing 1600 cc and featuring direct injection, laser ignition and forced induction.

* Wankel family – 1.0 L-2.0 L Wankel (1967–present)
** 10A – 1.0 L (1967–1973)
** 0813 – 1.0 L (1968–1972)
** 13A – 1.3 L (1970–1972)
** 12A – 1.1 L (1970–1985)
** 13B – 1.3 L (1973–2002)
** 20B – 2.0 L three-rotor (1990–1996)
** R26B – 2.6 L four-rotor (1991 24 Hours of Le Mans winner)
** Renesis – 1.3 L (2004–2013)
* Mazda Skyactiv-R – (Coming Soon)

== Gasoline Diesel Engine ==
* SKYACTIV-X</text><links>

<text>Abraham Yakin (; 31 July 1924 – 10 May 2020) was an Israeli artist.

== Background ==
Abraham Yakin was born in Jerusalem. During the Second World War, he joined the Royal Navy and served three years in the Mediterranean Fleet. During this time he became acquainted with the art of Egypt, Greece, France and Italy. After the war, he returned to Jerusalem and joined the Haganah. At the same time, he started his artistic training at Bezalel Academy, where he studied with Jacob Steinhardt and Mordecai Ardon.

With Israel&#x27;s declaration of independence, Yakin joined the Israel Defense Forces. He resumed his studies in 1950, and he had his first exhibition in 1953. In 1957 he married Hannah, an artist who had recently immigrated from the Netherlands. The couple divided their time between raising eight children, teaching art in Jerusalem, and exhibiting extensively in Israel, Europe and the United States.

In 1961 Abraham Yakin won the international Adolphe Neumann Prize in Paris. Works of Yakin are in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, the Musee d&#x27;Art Juif, Paris, and several museums in the Netherlands.

<doc id="732946" wikidata="Q817488" url="?curid=732946" title="Benjamin Butler">
<text>Benjamin Franklin Butler (November 5, 1818 – January 11, 1893) was an American major general of the Union Army, politician, lawyer, and businessman from Massachusetts. Born in New Hampshire and raised in Lowell, Massachusetts, Butler was a political major general of the Union Army during the American Civil War and had a leadership role in the impeachment of U.S. president Andrew Johnson. He was a colorful and often controversial figure on the national stage and on the Massachusetts political scene, serving five terms in the U.S. House of Representatives and running several campaigns for governor before his election to that office in 1882.

Butler, a successful trial lawyer, served in the Massachusetts legislature as an antiwar Democrat and as an officer in the state militia. Early in the Civil War he joined the Union Army, where he first gained renown when he refused to return escaped slaves, designating them as contraband of war, an idea that the Lincoln administration endorsed and that played a role in making emancipation an official war goal. Later in the war, he was noted for his questionable military skills and his controversial command of New Orleans, which made him widely disliked in the South and earned him the &quot;Beast&quot; epithet. His commands were marred by financial and logistical dealings across enemy lines, some of which may have taken place with his knowledge and to his financial benefit.

Butler was dismissed from the Union Army after his failures in the First Battle of Fort Fisher, but he soon won election to the United States House of Representatives from Massachusetts. As a Radical Republican he considered President Johnson&#x27;s Reconstruction agenda to be too weak, advocating harsher punishments of former Confederate leadership and stronger stances on civil rights reform. He was also an early proponent of the prospect of impeaching Johnson. After Johnson was impeached in early 1868, Butler served as the lead prosecutor among the House-appointed impeachment managers in the Johnson impeachment trial proceedings. Additionally, as Chairman of the House Committee on Reconstruction, Butler authored the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 and coauthored the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1875.

In Massachusetts, Butler was often at odds with more conservative members of the political establishment over matters of both style and substance. Feuds with Republican politicians led to his being denied several nominations for the governorship between 1858 and 1880. Returning to the Democratic fold, he won the governorship in the 1882 election with Democratic and Greenback Party support. He ran for president on the Greenback Party and the Anti-Monopoly Party tickets in 1884.

==Early years==
Benjamin Franklin Butler was born in Deerfield, New Hampshire, the sixth and youngest child of John Butler and Charlotte Ellison Butler. His father served under General Andrew Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans during the War of 1812 and later became a privateer, dying of yellow fever in the West Indies not long after Benjamin was born. He was named after Founding Father Benjamin Franklin. His elder brother, Andrew Jackson Butler (1815–1864), served as a colonel in the Union Army during the Civil War and joined him in New Orleans. Butler&#x27;s mother was a devout Baptist who encouraged him to read the Bible and prepare for the ministry. In 1827, at the age of nine, Butler was awarded a scholarship to Phillips Exeter Academy, where he spent one term. He was described by a schoolmate as &quot;a reckless, impetuous, headstrong boy&quot;, and regularly got into fights.

Butler&#x27;s mother moved the family in 1828 to Lowell, Massachusetts, where she operated a boarding house for workers at the textile mills. He attended the public schools there, from which he was almost expelled for fighting, the principal describing him as a boy who &quot;might be led, but could not be driven.&quot; He attended Waterville (now Colby) College in pursuit of his mother&#x27;s wish that he prepare for the ministry, but eventually rebelled against the idea. In 1836, Butler sought permission to go instead to West Point for a military education, but he did not receive one of the few places available. He continued his studies at Waterville, where he sharpened his rhetorical skills in theological discussions and began to adopt Democratic Party political views. He graduated in August 1838. Butler returned to Lowell, where he clerked and read law as an apprentice with a local lawyer. He was admitted to the Massachusetts bar in 1840 and opened a practice in Lowell.

After an extended courtship, Butler married Sarah Hildreth, a stage actress and daughter of Dr. Israel Hildreth of Lowell, on May 16, 1844. They had four children: Paul (1845–1850), Blanche (1847–1939), Paul (1852–1918) and Ben-Israel (1855–1881). Butler&#x27;s business partners included Sarah&#x27;s brother Fisher and her brother-in-law, W. P. Webster.

In 1844, Butler was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society.

==Law and early business dealings==
Butler quickly gained a reputation as a dogged criminal defense lawyer who seized on every misstep of his opposition to gain victories for his clients, and also became a specialist in bankruptcy law. His trial work was so successful that it received regular press coverage, and he was able to expand his practice into Boston. George Riley worked at his Boston law office.

Butler&#x27;s success as a lawyer enabled him to purchase shares in Lowell&#x27;s Middlesex Mill Company when they were cheap. Although he generally represented workers in legal actions, he also sometimes represented mill owners. When he became more politically active, he advocated the passage of a law establishing a ten-hour day for laborers, but he also opposed labor strikes over the matter. He instituted a ten-hour work day at the Middlesex Mills.

==Pre-Civil War political career==
During the debates over the ten-hour day a Whig-supporting Lowell newspaper published a verse suggesting that Butler&#x27;s father had been hanged for piracy. Butler sued the paper&#x27;s editor and publisher for that and other allegations that had been printed about himself. The editor was convicted and fined $50, but the publisher was acquitted on a technicality. Butler blamed the Whig judge, Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar, for the acquittal, inaugurating a feud between the two that would last for decades and significantly color Butler&#x27;s reputation in the state.

Butler, as a Democrat, supported the Compromise of 1850 and regularly spoke out against the abolition of slavery. At the state level, he supported the coalition of Democrats and Free Soilers that elected George S. Boutwell governor in 1851. This garnered him enough support to win election to the state legislature in 1852. His support for Franklin Pierce as president, however, cost him the seat the next year. He was elected a delegate to the 1853 state constitutional convention with strong Catholic support, and was elected to the state senate in 1858, a year dominated by Republican victories in the state. Butler was nominated for governor in 1859 and ran on a pro-slavery, pro-tariff platform. He lost to incumbent Republican Nathaniel Prentice Banks.

In the 1860 Democratic National Convention at Charleston, South Carolina, Butler initially supported John C. Breckinridge for president but then shifted his support to Jefferson Davis, believing that only a moderate Southerner could keep the Democratic party from dividing. A conversation he had with Davis prior to the convention convinced him that Davis might be such a man, and he gave him his support before the convention split over slavery. Butler ended up supporting Breckinridge over Douglas against state party instructions, ruining his standing with the state party apparatus. He was nominated for governor in the 1860 election by a Breckinridge splinter of the state party, but trailed far behind other candidates.

==Civil War==
Although he sympathized with the South, Butler stated, &quot;I was always a friend of southern rights but an enemy of southern wrongs&quot; and sought to serve in the Union Army. His military career before the Civil War began as a private in the Lowell militia in 1840. Butler eventually rose to become colonel of a regiment of primarily Irish American men. In 1855, the nativist Know Nothing governor Henry J. Gardner disbanded Butler&#x27;s militia, but Butler was elected brigadier general after the militia was reorganized. In 1857 Secretary of War Jefferson Davis appointed him to the Board of Visitors of West Point. These positions did not give him any significant military experience.

===1860===
After Abraham Lincoln was elected president in November 1860, Butler traveled to Washington, D.C. When a secessionist South Carolina delegation arrived there he recommended to lameduck President James Buchanan that they be arrested and charged with treason. Buchanan rejected the idea. Butler also met with Jefferson Davis and learned that he was not the Union man that Butler had previously thought he was. Butler then returned to Massachusetts, where he warned Governor John A. Andrew that hostilities were likely and that the state militia should be readied. He took advantage of the mobilization to secure a contract with the state for his mill to supply heavy cloth to the militia. Military contracts would constitute a significant source of profits for Butler&#x27;s mill throughout the war.

===Petitioning for military leadership appointment===
Butler also worked to secure a leadership position should the militia be deployed. He first offered his services to Governor Andrew in March 1861. When the call for militia finally arrived in April, Massachusetts was asked for only three regiments, but Butler managed to have the request expanded to include a brigadier general. He telegraphed Secretary of War Simon Cameron, with whom he was acquainted, suggesting that Cameron issue a request for a brigadier and general staff from Massachusetts, which soon afterward appeared on Governor Andrew&#x27;s desk. He then used banking contacts to ensure that loans that would be needed to fund the militia operations would be conditioned on his appointment. Despite Andrew&#x27;s desire to assign the brigadier position to Ebenezer Peirce, the bank insisted on Butler, and he was sent south to ensure the security of transportation routes to Washington. The nation&#x27;s capital was threatened with isolation from free states because it was unclear whether Maryland, a slave state, would also secede.

===1861: Baltimore and Virginia operations===

The two regiments Massachusetts sent to Maryland were the 6th and 8th Volunteer Militia. The 6th departed first and was caught up in a secessionist riot in Baltimore, Maryland on April 19. Butler traveled with the 8th, which left Philadelphia the next day amid news that railroad connections around Baltimore were being severed. Butler and the 8th traveled by rail and ferry to Maryland&#x27;s capital, Annapolis, where Governor Thomas H. Hicks attempted to dissuade them from landing. Butler landed his troops (who needed food and water), occupying the Naval Academy. When Hicks informed Butler that no one would sell provisions to his force, Butler pointed out that armed men did not necessarily have to pay for needed provisions, and he would use all measures necessary to ensure order.

After being joined by the 7th New York Militia, Butler directed his men to restore rail service between Annapolis and Washington via Annapolis Junction, which was accomplished by April 27. He also threatened Maryland legislators with arrest if they voted in favor of secession, and he seized the Great Seal of Maryland, &quot;without which no legislation could become law.&quot; Butler&#x27;s prompt actions in securing Annapolis were received with approval by the US Army&#x27;s top general, Winfield Scott, and he was given formal orders to maintain the security of the transit links in Maryland. In early May, Scott ordered Butler to lead the operations that occupied Baltimore. On May 13 he entered Baltimore on a train with 1000 men and artillery, with no opposition. That was done in contravention of Butler&#x27;s orders from Scott, which had been to organize four columns to approach the city by land and sea. General Scott criticized Butler for his strategy (despite its success) as well as his heavy-handed assumption of control of much of the civil government, and he recalled him to Washington. Butler shortly after received one of the early appointments as major general of the volunteer forces. His exploits in Maryland also brought nationwide press attention, including significant negative press in the South, which concocted stories about him that were conflations of biographical details involving not just Butler but also a namesake from New York and others.

===Fort Monroe, Virginia===

When two Massachusetts regiments had been sent overland to Maryland, two more were dispatched by sea under Butler&#x27;s command to secure Fort Monroe at the mouth of the James River. After being dressed down by Scott for overstepping his authority, Butler was next assigned command of Fort Monroe and of the Department of Virginia. On May 27, Butler sent a force north to occupy the lightly defended adjacent town of Newport News, Virginia at Newport News Point, an excellent anchorage for the Union Navy. The force established and significantly fortified Camp Butler and a battery at Newport News Point that could cover the entrance to the James River ship canal and the mouth of the Nansemond River. Butler also expanded Camp Hamilton, established in the adjacent town of Hampton, Virginia, just beyond the confines of the fort and within the range of its guns.

The Union occupation of Fort Monroe was considered a threat to Richmond by Confederate General Robert E. Lee, and he began organizing the defense of the Virginia Peninsula in response. Confederate General John B. Magruder, seeking to buy time while awaiting men and supplies, established well-defended forward outposts near Big and Little Bethel, only from Butler&#x27;s camp at Newport News as a lure to draw his opponent into a premature action. Butler took the bait, and suffered an embarrassing defeat at the Battle of Big Bethel on June 10. Butler devised a plan for a night march and operation against the positions but chose not to lead the force in person, for which he was criticized. The plan proved too complex for his inadequately trained subordinates and troops to carry out, especially at night, and was further marred by the failure of staff to communicate passwords and precautions. A friendly fire incident during the night gave away the Union position, further harming the advance, which was attempted without knowledge of the layout or the strength of the Confederate positions. Massachusetts militia general Ebenezer W. Peirce, who commanded in the field, received the most criticism for the failed operation. With the withdrawal of many of his men for use elsewhere, Butler was unable to maintain the camp at Hampton, although his forces retained the camp at Newport News. Butler&#x27;s commission, which required approval from Congress, was vigorously debated after Big Bethel, with critical comment raised about his lack of military experience. But his commission was narrowly approved on July 21, the day of the First Battle of Bull Run, the war&#x27;s first large-scale battle. The battle&#x27;s poor outcome for the Union was used as cover by General Scott to reduce Butler&#x27;s force to one incapable of substantive offense, and it was implicit in Scott&#x27;s orders that the troops were needed nearer to Washington.
In August, Butler commanded an expeditionary force that, in conjunction with the United States Navy, took Forts Hatteras and Clark in North Carolina. That move, the first significant Union victory after First Bull Run, was lauded in Washington and won Butler accolades from President Lincoln. Butler was sent back to Massachusetts to raise new forces. That thrust Butler into a power struggle with Governor Andrew, who insisted on maintaining his authority to appoint regimental officers, refusing to commission (among others) Butler&#x27;s brother Andrew and several of the general&#x27;s close associates. The spat instigated a recruiting war between Butler and the state militia organization. The dispute delayed Butler&#x27;s return to Virginia, and in November he was assigned to command ground troops in Louisiana.

While in command at Fort Monroe, Butler had declined to return to their owners fugitive slaves who had come within his lines. He argued that Virginians considered them to be chattel property, and that they could not appeal to the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 because of Virginia&#x27;s secession. &quot;I am under no constitutional obligations to a foreign country,&quot; he said, &quot;which Virginia now claims to be.&quot; Furthermore, slaves used as laborers for building fortifications and other military activities could be considered contraband of war. &quot;Lincoln and his Cabinet discussed the issue on May 30 and decided to support Butler&#x27;s stance&quot;. It was later made standard Union Army policy to not return fugitive slaves. This policy was soon extended to the Union Navy.

===New Orleans===
Butler directed the first Union expedition to Ship Island, off the Mississippi Gulf Coast, in December 1861, and in May 1862 commanded the force that conducted the capture of New Orleans after its occupation by the Navy following the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip. In the administration of that city he showed great firmness and political subtlety. He devised a plan for relief of the poor, demanded oaths of allegiance from anyone who sought any privilege from government, and confiscated weapons.

However, Butler&#x27;s subtlety seemed to fail him as the military governor of New Orleans when it came to dealing with its Jewish population, about which the general, referring to local smugglers, infamously wrote, in October 1862: &quot;They are Jews who betrayed their Savior, &amp; also have betrayed us.&quot;

====Public health management====
In an ordinary year, it was not unusual for as much as 10 percent of the city&#x27;s population to die of yellow fever. In preparation, Butler imposed strict quarantines and introduced a rigid program of garbage disposal. As a result, in 1862, only two cases were reported.

====Civil administration difficulties====
Many of his acts, however, were highly unpopular. Most notorious was Butler&#x27;s General Order No. 28 of May 15, 1862, that if any woman should insult or show contempt for any officer or soldier of the United States, she may be treated similarly to a &quot;woman of the town plying her avocation,&quot; i.e., a prostitute. This was in response to various acts of verbal and physical abuse inappropriate of &quot;respectable&quot; women, including mocking the funeral cortège of a fallen soldier, spitting in the faces of U.S. officers, pouring chamber pots full of human excrement on patrolling U.S. soldiers, and, in one notorious case, pouring urine on Admiral David Farragut, the Union Navy commander.

&quot;Butler&#x27;s &#x27;Woman Order&#x27; was immediately effective. Insults by word, look or gesture abruptly ceased... Throughout the South, however, the Woman Order evoked a universal shout of execration&quot;. Butler&#x27;s insistence on prosecuting the woman as any other person &quot;aiding the Confederacy&quot; provoked angry jeers from white residents of New Orleans, who amplified a narrative that he used his power to engage in the petty looting of New Orleanians. &quot;[F]or years after the Civil War steamships plying the lower Mississippi were furnished with chamber pots bearing the likeness of &#x27;Beast Butler.

He was nicknamed &quot;Butler the Beast&quot; by Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard (despite Beauregard&#x27;s leaving his wife under Butler&#x27;s personal care) or alternatively &quot;Spoons Butler&quot;, the latter nickname deriving primarily from an incident in which Butler seized a 38-piece set of silverware from a New Orleans woman who attempted to cross Union lines while using a pass that permitted her to carry nothing more than the clothing on her person.

====Cotton seizures====
Shortly after the Confiscation Act of 1862 became effective in September, Butler increasingly relied upon it as a means of grabbing cotton. Since the Act permitted confiscation of property owned by anyone &quot;aiding the Confederacy,&quot; Butler reversed his earlier policy of encouraging trade by refusing to confiscate cotton brought into New Orleans for sale. First, he conducted a census in which 4,000 respondents failing to pledge loyalty to the Union were banished. Their property was seized and sold at low auction prices in which his brother Andrew was often the prime buyer. Next, the general sent expeditions into the countryside with no military purpose other than to confiscate cotton from residents who were assumed to be disloyal. Once brought into New Orleans, the cotton would be similarly sold in rigged auctions. To maintain correct appearances, auction proceeds were dutifully held for the benefit of &quot;just claimants&quot;, but the Butler consortium still ended up owning the cotton at bargain prices. Always inventive of new terminology to achieve his ends, Butler sequestered, or made vulnerable to confiscation, such &quot;properties&quot; in all of Louisiana beyond parishes surrounding New Orleans.

====Censorship of newspapers====
Butler censored New Orleans newspapers. When William Seymour, the editor of the &quot;New-Orleans Commercial Bulletin&quot;, asked Butler what would happen if the newspaper ignored his censorship, an angry Butler reportedly stated, &quot;I am the military governor of this state — the supreme power — you cannot disregard my order, Sir. By God, he that sins against me, sins against the Holy Ghost.&quot; When Seymour published a favorable obituary of his father, who had been killed serving in the Confederate army in Virginia, Butler confiscated the newspaper and imprisoned Seymour for three months.

====Execution of William Mumford====
On June 7, 1862, Butler ordered the execution of William B. Mumford for tearing down a United States flag placed by Admiral Farragut on the United States Mint in New Orleans. In his memoirs, Butler maintained that &quot;[a] party headed by Mumford had torn down the flag, dragged it through the streets and spit on it, and trampled on it until it was torn to pieces. It was then distributed among the rabble, and each one thought it a high honor to get a piece of it and wear it.&quot; Butler added that these actions were &quot;against the laws of war and his country.&quot;

Before Mumford was executed, Butler permitted him to make a speech for as long as he wished, and Mumford defended his actions by claiming that he was acting out of a high sense of patriotism. Most, including Mumford and his family, expected Butler to pardon him. The general refused to do so, but promised to care for his family if necessary. (After the war, Butler fulfilled his promise by paying off a mortgage on Mumford&#x27;s widow&#x27;s house and helping her find government employment.) For the execution and General Order No. 28, he was denounced (December 1862) by Confederate President Jefferson Davis in General Order 111 as a felon deserving capital punishment, who, if captured, should be &quot;reserved for execution&quot;.

====Recall====
Although Butler&#x27;s governance of New Orleans was popular in the North, where it was seen as a successful stand against recalcitrant secessionists, some of his actions, notably those against the foreign consuls, concerned Lincoln, who authorized his recall in December 1862. Butler was replaced by Nathaniel P. Banks. The necessity of taking sometimes radical actions and the support he received in Radical Republican circles drove Butler to change political allegiance, and he joined the Republican Party. He also sought revenge against the more moderate Secretary of State Seward, whom he believed to be responsible for his eventual recall.

Butler continues to be a disliked and controversial figure in New Orleans and the rest of the South.

====Louisiana Native Guard====

On September 27, 1862, Butler formed the first African-American regiment in the US Army, the 1st Louisiana Native Guard, and commissioned 30 officers to command it at the company level. This was highly unusual, as most USCT regiments were commanded by white officers only. &quot;Better soldiers never shouldered a musket,&quot; Butler wrote, &quot;I observed a very remarkable trait about them. They learned to handle arms and to march more easily than intelligent white men. My drillmaster could teach a regiment of Negroes that much of the art of war sooner than he could have taught the same number of students from Harvard or Yale.&quot; The regiment would serve Butler effectively during the Siege of Port Hudson. Butler organized three regiments totaling 3,122 soldiers and officers.

===Army of the James===
Butler&#x27;s popularity with the Radicals meant that Lincoln could not readily deny him a new posting. Lincoln considered sending him to a position in the Mississippi River area in early 1863, and categorically refused to send him back to New Orleans. In November 1863, he finally gave Butler command of the Department of Virginia and North Carolina based in Norfolk, Virginia. In January 1864, Butler played a pivotal role in the creation of six regiments of U.S. Volunteers recruited from among Confederate prisoners of war (&quot;Galvanized Yankees&quot;) for duty on the western frontier. In May, the forces under his command were designated the Army of the James. On November 4, 1864, Butler arrived in New York City with 3,500 troops of the Army of the James. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton had &quot;requested that Grant send troops to New York City to help oversee the election there. Stanton&#x27;s concern arose from the city&#x27;s perennial political and racial divisions, which had erupted during the 1863 draft riots,&quot; and because of fear of Confederates coming from Canada to burn the city on Election Day. Grant selected Butler for the assignment. &quot;Even though he knew nothing about the plot [to burn the city] and did nothing to prevent it, Butler&#x27;s mere presence with his 3,500 troops&quot; demoralized the leaders of the conspiracy, who postponed it until November 25, when it failed.

The Army of the James also included several regiments of United States Colored Troops. These troops saw combat in the Bermuda Hundred campaign (see below). At the Battle of Chaffin&#x27;s Farm (sometimes also called the Battle of New Market Heights), the USCT troops performed extremely well. The 38th USCT defeated a more powerful force despite intense fire, heavy casualties, and terrain obstacles. Butler awarded the Medal of Honor to several men of the 38th USCT. He also ordered a special medal designed and struck, which was awarded to 200 African-American soldiers who had served with distinction in the engagement. This was later called the Butler Medal.

====Bermuda Hundred campaign====

In the spring of 1864, the Army of the James was directed to land at Bermuda Hundred on the James River, south of Richmond, and from there attack Petersburg. This would sever the rail links supplying Richmond, and force the Confederates to abandon the city. In spite of Grant&#x27;s low opinion of Butler&#x27;s military skills, he was given command of the operation.

Butler&#x27;s force landed on May 5, when Petersburg was almost undefended, but Butler became unnerved by the presence of a handful of Confederate militia and home guards. While he dithered, the Confederates assembled a substantial force under General P. G. T. Beauregard. On 13 May, Butler&#x27;s advance toward Richmond was repulsed. On May 16, the Confederates drove Butler&#x27;s force back to Bermuda Hundred, bottling up the Union troops in a loop of the James River. Both sides entrenched; the Union troops were safe but impotent, and Beauregard sent most of his troops as reinforcements to Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia. Had Butler been more aggressive in early May, he might have taken Petersburg or even Richmond itself and ended the war a year early, although his two West Pointer corps commanders Maj. Gen &quot;Baldly&quot; Smith and Quincy Gilmore also did not perform well or make up for Butler&#x27;s limitations as a general.

Despite this fiasco, Butler remained in command of the Army of the James.

===Fort Fisher and final recall===

Although Grant had largely been successful in removing incompetent political generals from service, Butler could not be easily gotten rid of. As a prominent Radical Republican, Butler was a potential replacement of Lincoln as presidential nominee. Lincoln had even asked Butler to be the 1864 nominee for vice president, as did Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase, who sought to replace Lincoln as president. In reply to Lincoln&#x27;s offer, Butler said, &quot;Tell him ... I would not quit the field [resign as major general] to be Vice-President, even with himself as President, unless he will give me bond with sureties ... that he will die or resign within three months after his inauguration. Ask him what he thinks I have done to deserve the punishment ... of being made to sit as presiding officer over the Senate, to listen for four years to debates more or less stupid, in which I can take no part or say a word...&quot;

There was no good place to put Butler; sending him to Missouri or Kentucky would likely end in disaster, so it was considered safer to leave him where he was in Virginia. More worrying was the fact that Butler was one of the highest ranking volunteer major generals in the Union army; next to Grant himself, he was the ranking field officer in the Eastern theater, and command of the Army of the Potomac would default to him in Grant&#x27;s absence. For that reason, Grant remained with the army as much as possible and only made trips away from the front when it was absolutely necessary.

In December, troops from the Army of the James were sent to attack Fort Fisher in North Carolina with Butler in command. Butler devised a scheme to breach the defenses with a boat loaded with gunpowder, which failed completely. He then declared that Fort Fisher was impregnable and withdrew his troops without authorization. However, Admiral David Dixon Porter (commander of the naval element of the expedition) informed Grant that it could be taken easily if anyone competent were put in charge.

This mismanagement finally led to his recall by Grant in early 1865. As Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton was not in Washington at the time, Grant appealed directly to Lincoln for permission to terminate Butler, noting &quot;there is a lack of confidence felt in [Butler&#x27;s] military ability&quot;. Grant also voiced his suspicions about corruption going on in Butler&#x27;s department, including smuggling of supplies to Lee&#x27;s army, and that Butler arbitrarily arrested anyone who noticed what was going on, although, due to Butler&#x27;s formidable political connections, nothing came of Grant&#x27;s complaints. By this point, the presidential election was over, so the administration no longer had to be concerned about Butler&#x27;s running for president, and, in General Order Number 1, Lincoln relieved him from command of the Department of North Carolina and Virginia and ordered him to report to Lowell, Massachusetts. Grant informed Butler of his recall on January 8, 1865, and named Major General Edward O. C. Ord to replace him as commander of the Army of the James. &quot;Embarrassed and outraged, Butler broke off all relations with Grant and set out to destroy him.&quot; In 1867, when it seemed that Grant might run for president, Butler &quot;employed detectives in an effort to prove that Grant was &#x27;a drunkard, after fast horses, women and whores.&#x27; Grant, he announced, was &#x27;a man without a head or a heart, indifferent to human suffering and impotent to govern.

Rather than report to Lowell, Butler went to Washington, where he used his considerable political connections to get a hearing before the Joint Congressional Committee on the Conduct of the War in mid-January. At his hearing Butler focused his defense on his actions at Fort Fisher. He produced charts and duplicates of reports by subordinates to prove he had been right to call off his attack of Fort Fisher, despite orders from General Grant to the contrary. Butler claimed the fort was impregnable. To his embarrassment, a follow-up expedition led by Maj. Gen. Alfred H. Terry and Brig. Gen. Adelbert Ames (Butler&#x27;s future son-in-law) captured the fort on January 15, and news of this victory arrived during the committee hearing; Butler&#x27;s military career was over. He was formally retained until November 1865 with the idea that he might act as military prosecutor of Confederate President Jefferson Davis.

===Colonization===

General Butler claimed that Lincoln approached him in 1865, a few days before his assassination, to talk about reviving colonization in Panama. Since the mid-twentieth century, historians have debated the validity of Butler&#x27;s account, as Butler wrote it years after the fact and was prone to exaggerating his prowess as a general. Recently discovered documents prove that Butler and Lincoln did indeed meet on April 11, 1865, though whether and to what extent they talked about colonization is not recorded except in Butler&#x27;s account.

===Financial dealings===
Negative perceptions of Butler were compounded by his questionable financial dealings in several of his commands, as well as the activities of his brother Andrew, who acted as Butler&#x27;s financial proxy and was given &quot;almost free rein&quot; to engage in exploitative business deals and other &quot;questionable activities&quot; in New Orleans. Upon arriving in the city, Butler immediately began attempts to participate in the lucrative inter-belligerent trade. He used a Federal warship to send $60,000 in sugar to Boston where he expected to sell it for $160,000. However, his use of the government ship was reported to the military authorities, and Butler was chastised. Instead of earning a profit, military authorities permitted him to recover only his $60,000 plus expenses. Thereafter, his brother Andrew officially represented the family in such activities. Everyone in New Orleans believed that Andrew accumulated a profit of $1–$2 million while in Louisiana. Upon inquiry from Treasury Secretary Chase in October 1862, the general responded that his brother actually cleared less than $200,000 (~$ in ). When Butler was replaced in New Orleans by Major General Nathaniel Banks, Andrew Butler unsuccessfully tried to bribe Banks with $100,000 if Banks would permit Andrew&#x27;s &quot;commercial program&quot; to be carried out &quot;as previous to [Banks&#x27;s] arrival.&quot;

Butler&#x27;s administration of the Norfolk district was also tainted by financial scandal and cross-lines business dealings. Historian Ludwell Johnson concluded that during that period: &quot;... there can be no doubt that a very extensive trade with the Confederacy was carried on in [Butler&#x27;s Norfolk] Department... This trade was extremely profitable for Northern merchants ... and was a significant help to the Confederacy... It was conducted with Butler&#x27;s help and a considerable part of it was in the hands of his relatives and supporters.&quot;

Shortly after arriving in Norfolk, Butler became surrounded by such men. Foremost among them was Brigadier General George Shepley, who had been military governor of Louisiana. Butler invited Shepley to join him and &quot;take care of Norfolk.&quot; After his arrival, Shepley was empowered to issue military permits allowing goods to be transported through the lines. He designated subordinate George Johnston to manage the task. In fall 1864, Johnston was charged with corruption. However, instead of being prosecuted, he was allowed to resign after saying he could show &quot;that General Butler was a partner in all [the controversial] transactions,&quot; along with the general&#x27;s brother-in-law Fisher Hildreth. Shortly thereafter, Johnston managed a thriving between-the-lines trade depot in eastern North Carolina. There is no doubt that Butler was aware of Shepley&#x27;s trading activities. His own chief of staff complained about them and spoke of businessmen who &quot;owned&quot; Shepley. Butler took no action.

Much of the Butler-managed Norfolk trade was via the Dismal Swamp Canal to six northeastern counties in North Carolina separated from the rest of the state by Albemarle Sound and the Chowan River. Although cotton was not a major crop, area farmers purchased bales from the Confederate government and took them through the lines where they would be traded for &quot;family supplies.&quot; Generally, the Southerners returned with salt, sugar, cash, and miscellaneous supplies. They used the salt to preserve butchered pork, which they sold to the Confederate commissary. After Atlantic-blockaded ports such as Charleston and Wilmington were captured, this route supplied about ten thousand pounds of bacon, sugar, coffee, and codfish daily to Lee&#x27;s army. Ironically, Grant was trying to cut off Lee&#x27;s supplies from the Confederacy when Lee&#x27;s provender was almost entirely furnished from Yankee sources through Butler-controlled Norfolk. Grant wrote of the issue, &quot;Whilst the army was holding Lee in Richmond and Petersburg, I found ... [Lee] ... was receiving supplies, either through the inefficiency or permission of [an] officer selected by General Butler ... from Norfolk through the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal.&quot;

Butler&#x27;s replacement, Major General George H. Gordon, was appalled at the nature of the ongoing trade. Reports were circulating that $100,000 in goods daily left Norfolk for Rebel armies. Grant instructed Gordon to investigate the prior trading practices at Norfolk, after which Gordon released a sixty-page indictment of Butler and his cohorts. It concluded that Butler associates, such as Hildreth and Shepley, were responsible for supplies from Butler&#x27;s district pouring &quot;directly into the departments of the Rebel Commissary and Quartermaster.&quot; Some Butler associates sold permits for cross-line trafficking for a fee. Gordon&#x27;s report received little publicity, because of the end of the war and Lincoln&#x27;s assassination.

==Postbellum business and charitable dealings==
Butler greatly expanded his business interests during and after the Civil War, and was extremely wealthy when he died, with an estimated net worth of $7 million ($ million today). Historian Chester Hearn believed &quot;The source of his fortune has remained a mystery, but much of it came from New Orleans...&quot; However, Butler&#x27;s mills in Lowell, which produced woolen goods and were not hampered by cotton shortages, were economically successful during the war, supplying clothing and blankets to the Union Army, and regularly paying high dividends. Successful postwar investments included a granite company on Cape Ann and a barge freight operation on the Merrimack River. After learning that no domestic manufacturer produced bunting, he invested in another Lowell mill to produce it, and convinced the federal government to enact legislation requiring domestic sources for material used on government buildings. Less successful ventures included investments in real estate in Virginia, Colorado, and the Baja Peninsula of western Mexico, and a fraudulent gold mining operation in North Carolina. He also founded the Wamesit Power Company and the United States Cartridge Company, and was one of several high-profile investors who were deceived by Philip Arnold in the famous Diamond hoax of 1872.

Butler put some of his money into more charitable enterprises. He purchased confiscated farms in the Norfolk, Virginia area during the war and turned them over to cooperative ventures managed by local African Americans, and sponsored a scholarship for African-Americans at Phillips Andover Academy. He also served for fifteen years in executive positions of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, including as its president from 1866 through 1879.

His law firm also expanded significantly after the war, adding offices in New York City and Washington. High-profile cases he took included the representation of Admiral David Farragut in his quest to be paid by the government for prizes taken by the Navy during the war, and the defense of former Secretary of War Simon Cameron against an attempted extortion in a salacious case that gained much public notice.

Butler built a mansion immediately across the street from the United States Capitol in 1873–1874, known as the Butler Building. One unit of the building was constructed to be fireproof so that it could be rented as storage for valuable and irreplaceable survey records, maps, and engraving plates of the United States Coast Survey (renamed the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1878), whose headquarters in the Richards Building was directly next door. The building was used by President Chester A. Arthur while the White House was being refurnished. On April 10, 1891, the Department of the Treasury purchased the building from Butler for $275,000, (~$ in ) and it became the headquarters of the U.S. Marine Hospital Service, with its Hygienic Laboratory (the predecessor of the National Institutes of Health) occupying its top floor.

==Early postbellum political activities==
At the urging of his wife, Butler actively sought another political position in the Lincoln administration, but this effort came to an end with Lincoln&#x27;s assassination in April 1865. Soon after he became president, however, Andrew Johnson sought Butler&#x27;s legal advice as to whether he could prosecute Robert E. Lee for treason, even though General Grant had granted Lee parole at Appomattox. &quot;On April 25, 1865, Butler wrote a lengthy memorandum to Johnson explaining why the parole Lee received from Grant did not protect him from being prosecuted for treason... Butler argued that parole was merely a military arrangement that allowed a prisoner &#x27;the privilege of partial liberty instead of close confinement... Indeed the Lieutenant General [Grant] had not authority to grant amnesty or pardon even if he had undertaken to do so.

In March 1866, Butler argued in the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of the United States in &quot;Ex parte Milligan&quot;, in which the Court held, against the United States, that military commission trials could not replace civilian trials when courts were open and where there was no war.

==United States House of Representatives (1867–75 and 1877–79)==
Popular from his reputation as a general, Butler turned his eyes to Congress and was elected in 1866 on a platform of civil rights and opposition to President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s weak Reconstruction policies. He supported a variety of populist and social reform positions, including women&#x27;s suffrage, an eight-hour workday for federal employees, and the issuance of greenback currency. In his stump speeches, Butler not only denounced Johnson, but also regularly called for his removal from office.

Butler served four terms (1867–75) before failing to be reelected (after hostile Republicans led by Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar succeeded in denying him renomination for his congressional seat in 1874). He was then elected in 1876 and served a single additional term. As a former Democrat, he was initially opposed by the state Republican establishment, which was particularly unhappy with his support of women&#x27;s suffrage and greenbacks. The more conservative party organization closed ranks against him to reject his two attempts (in 1871 and 1873) to gain the Republican nomination for Governor of Massachusetts.

===Impeachment of Andrew Johnson===
Butler was an early and fierce supporter of impeaching President Johnson.

As a congressional candidate, by October 1866 Butler was traveling to multiple cities across the United States delivering speeches in which he promoted the prospect of impeaching Johnson. He detailed six specific charges that Johnson should be impeached for. These were:

*Seeking to overthrow the government of the United States, doing so by attempting to bring Congress &quot;to disgrace&quot; by refusing to execute or carry out the laws that it had passed which he disagreed with, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau bills
*Corruptly using his powers to appoint and remove officers
*Declaring peace in the American Civil War without the consent of Congress
*Corruptly using his pardon powers and restoring to former Confederates property seized by the United States in the Civil War
*Failing to enforce the Civil Rights Act of 1866
*Complicity in the New Orleans massacre of 1866

By the end of November 1866, Congressman-elect Butler was promoting the idea of impeaching Johnson on the basis of eight articles. The articles that he proposed charged Johnson with:
*&quot;Degrading and debasing...the station and dignity of the office of Vice-President and that of president&quot; by being publicly drunk at &quot;official and public occasions&quot;
*&quot;Officially and publicly making declarations and inflammatory harangues, indecent and unbecoming in derogation of his high office, dangerous to the permanency of our republican form of government, and in design to excite the ridicule, fear, hatred, and contempt of the people against the legislative and judicial departments therof&quot;
*&quot;Wickedly, tyrannically, and unconstitutionally...usurping the lawful rights and powers of the Congress&quot;
*&quot;Wickedly and corruptly using and abusing&quot; the constitutional power of the President by making recess appointments with the &quot;design to undermine, overthrow and evade the power&quot; of the Congress to advice and consent on such appointments
*&quot;Improperly, wickedly, and corruptly abusing the constitutional power of pardons&quot; with his pardons for ex-Confederates; &quot;knowingly and willfully violating the constitutionally enacted laws of the United States by appointing disloyal men to office and illegally and without right giving to them emoluments of such office from the Treasury, well knowing the appointees to be ineligible to office&quot;
*&quot;Knowingly and willfully neglecting and refusing to carry out the constitutional laws of Congress&quot; in the former Confederate states &quot;in order to encourage men lately into rebellion and in arms against the United States to the oppression and injury of the loyal true citizens of such States&quot;
*&quot;Unlawfully, corruptly, and wickedly confederating and conspiring with one John T. Monroe...and other evil disposed persons, traitors, and Rebels&quot; in the New Orleans massacre of 1866.

In March 1867, Butler unsuccessfully lobbied to be appointed to the House Committee on the Judiciary, which was overseeing the first impeachment inquiry against Andrew Johnson. John Bingham, who had worked to combat many of the early efforts to impeach Johnson, strongly opposed the prospect of Butler&#x27;s being appointed to that committee.

Although Butler was not included on the select committee appointed to draft the articles of impeachment for Johnson after he was impeached in February 1868, he independently wrote his own article of impeachment. He did so at the urging of Thaddeus Stevens, a member of the select committee who felt that Radical Republicans on the select committee were conceding too much to moderates in limiting the scope of the violations of law that the articles of impeachment the committee was drafting would charge Johnson with. The article Butler wrote cited no clear violation of law, but instead charged Johnson with attempting, &quot;to bring into disgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt, and reproach the Congress of the United States.&quot; The article was seen as having been written in response to speeches that Johnson had made during his &quot;Swing Around the Circle&quot;. Butler&#x27;s article was initially rejected by a 48–74 vote on March 2, 1868. However, it was subsequently adopted as the tenth article of impeachment by a 88–45 vote after it was reintroduced by the impeachment managers the following day. It was the only article of impeachment that any Republican congressman voted against.


Butler was elected by the House serve as be one of the managers (prosecutors) for the impeachment trial of Johnson before the Senate. Although Thaddeus Stevens was the principal guiding force behind the impeachment effort, he was aging and ill at the time, and Butler stepped in to become the main organizing force in the prosecution. The case was focused primarily on Johnson&#x27;s removal of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton in violation of the Tenure of Office Act, and was weak because the constitutionality of the law had not been decided. The trial was a somewhat uncomfortable affair, in part because the weather was hot and humid, and the chamber was packed. The prosecution&#x27;s case was a humdrum recitation of facts already widely known, and it was attacked by the defense&#x27;s William Evarts, who drowned the proceedings by repeatedly objecting to Butler&#x27;s questions, often necessitating a vote by the Senate on whether to allow the question. Johnson&#x27;s defense focused on the point that his removal of Stanton fell within the bounds of the Tenure of Office Act. Despite some missteps by the defense and Butler&#x27;s vigorous cross-examination of defense witnesses, the impeachment failed by a single vote. In the interval between the trial and the Senate vote, Butler searched without success for substantive evidence that Johnson operatives were working to bribe undecided Senators. After acquittal on May 16, 1868, of the first article voted on, Senate Republicans voted to adjourn for ten days, seeking time to possibly change the outcome on the remaining articles.

Later on May 16, 1868, The House enabled an investigation by the impeachment managers into alleged &quot;improper or corrupt means used to influence the determination of the Senate&quot;. Butler led this investigation, approving summons for several eyewitnesses the same day that the investigation was authorized. Butler looked into the possibility that four of the seven Republican senators who voted for acquittal had been improperly influenced in their votes. He uncovered some evidence that promises of patronage had been made and that money may have changed hands but was unable to decisively link these actions to any specific senator.

On May 26, 1868, Johnson was acquitted on the second and third articles voted on, and the trial was adjourned. On August 3, 1868, Johnson wrote that Butler was &quot;the most daring and unscrupulous demagogue I have ever known.&quot; Butler&#x27;s performance as a prosecutor has been regarded as subpar, and this has been cited as a factor that contributed to Johnson&#x27;s acquittal. After the trial resulted in an acquittal, Butler continued the impeachment managers&#x27; investigation into possible corrupt influence on the trial, conducting hearings on reports that Republican senators had been bribed to vote for Johnson&#x27;s acquittal. He published the final report of the investigation on July 3, 1868, having failed to prove the alleged corruption that had been investigated.

===Civil Rights Act of 1871===

Butler wrote the initial version of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act). After his bill was defeated, Representative Samuel Shellabarger of Ohio drafted another bill, only slightly less sweeping than Butler&#x27;s, that successfully passed both houses and became law upon Grant&#x27;s signature on April 20. Along with Republican senator Charles Sumner, Butler proposed the Civil Rights Act of 1875, a seminal and far-reaching law banning racial discrimination in public accommodations. The Supreme Court of the United States declared the law unconstitutional in the 1883 Civil Rights Cases.

===Relationship with President Ulysses S. Grant===
Butler managed to rehabilitate his relationship with Ulysses Grant after the latter became president, to the point where he was seen as generally speaking for the president in the House. He annoyed Massachusetts old-guard Republicans by convincing Grant to nominate one of his protégés to be collector of the Port of Boston, an important patronage position, and secured an exception for an ally, John B. Sanborn, in legislation regulating the use of contractors by the Internal Revenue Service for the collection of tax debts. In 1874, Sanborn would be involved in the Sanborn Contract scandal, in which he was paid over $200,000 (~$ in ) for collecting debts that would likely have been paid without his intervention.

===Other actions===
In 1871, Butler sponsored an appearance by suffragette Victoria Woodhull before a congressional committee. In her testimony, Woodhull argued that the 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States implicitly grant women the right to vote. During his tenure in Congress, Butler served for some time as the chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary. During the 41st Congress, Butler served as the chairman of the House Select Committee on Reconstruction.

In a campaign speech in 1871, Butler spoke out in support of the Paris Commune. He described the working-class insurrection as &quot;possibly overshadowing the great act of emancipation by which this country liberated four millions of people.&quot; Butler&#x27;s speech provided a rare example of a U.S. politician offering solidarity to the Communards.

==Governor of Massachusetts (1883–84)==
===Unsuccessful bids===
Butler made four unsuccessful attempts at being elected governor of Massachusetts between the years 1871 and 1879.

In 1871 and 1874, he attempted to receive the Republican nomination, but the more conservative party organization closed ranks against him to deny him the nomination.

Butler again ran unsuccessfully for governor of Massachusetts in 1878, this time as an independent with Greenback Party support. He had unsuccessfully also sought the Democratic nomination. He was denied the Democratic nomination by the party&#x27;s leadership, which refused to admit him into the party. Despite this, Butler did receive the nomination of a populist rump group of Democrats that disrupted the main convention, forcing it to adjourn to another location. He was renominated by the populist Democrats in similar fashion in 1879. In both years, Republicans won against the divided Democrats.

Because Butler sought the governorship in part as a stepping stone to the presidency, he opted not to run for it again until 1882.

===Term in office===
In 1882, Butler successfully litigated &quot;Juilliard v. Greenman&quot; before the Supreme Court. In what was seen as a victory for Greenback supporters, the case confirmed that the government had the right to issue paper currency for public and private debts.

In 1882, Butler again ran for governor of Massachusetts, this time being elected by a 14,000-vote margin after winning nomination by both Greenbacks and an undivided Democratic Party. As governor, Butler was active in promoting reform and competence in administration, in spite of a hostile Republican legislature and Governor&#x27;s Council. He appointed the state&#x27;s first Irish-American judge, its first African American judge, George Lewis Ruffin, and appointed the first woman to executive office, Clara Barton, to head the Massachusetts Reformatory for Women. He also graphically exposed the mismanagement of the state&#x27;s Tewksbury Almshouse under a succession of Republican governors. Butler was somewhat notoriously snubbed by Harvard University, which traditionally granted honorary degrees to the state&#x27;s governors. Butler&#x27;s honorarium was denied because the Board of Overseers, headed by Ebenezer Hoar, voted against it.

Butler&#x27;s bid for reelection in 1883 was one of the most contentious campaigns of his career. His presidential ambitions were well known, and the state&#x27;s Republican establishment, led by Ebenezer and George Frisbie Hoar, poured money into the campaign against him. Running against Congressman George D. Robinson (whose campaign manager was a young Henry Cabot Lodge), Butler was defeated by 10,000 votes, out of more than 300,000 cast. Butler is credited with beginning the tradition of the &quot;lone walk&quot;, the ceremonial exit from the office of Governor of Massachusetts, after finishing his term in 1884.

==1884 presidential campaign==
Butler parlayed his victory in the &quot;Juilliard v. Greenman&quot; decision into a run for president in 1884. Butler was nominated by the Greenback and Anti-Monopoly parties, but was unsuccessful in getting the Democratic nomination, which went to Grover Cleveland. Cleveland refused to adopt parts of Butler&#x27;s platform in exchange for his political support, prompting Butler to run in the general election rather than withdrawing in deference to Cleveland. He sought to gain electoral votes by engaging in fusion efforts with Democrats in some states and Republicans in others, in which he took what were perceived in the contemporary press as bribes $25,000 from the campaign of Republican James G. Blaine. The effort was in vain: Butler polled 175,000 out of 10 million votes cast in the election, which Cleveland won.

==Later years and death==

In his later years Butler reduced his activity level, working on his memoir, &quot;Butler&#x27;s Book&quot;, which was published in 1892. &quot;Butler&#x27;s Book&quot; has 1,037 pages plus a 94-page appendix consisting of letters. In it, &quot;Butler focused by far the majority of his attention on the war years, vigorously defending his often-maligned record.&quot; He arranged &quot;with his longtime friend and ally James Parton [author of &quot;General Butler in New Orleans&quot;] that Parton would finish the book if Butler died before it was done. (As it happens, Parton died first, in October 1891).&quot; Butler&#x27;s biographer Richard S. West, Jr. writes, &quot;The autobiography may be said to be generally true without being meticulously accurate&quot;.

Butler died on January 11, 1893, of complications from a bronchial infection, two days after arguing a case before the Supreme Court. He is buried in his wife&#x27;s family cemetery, behind the main Hildreth Cemetery in Lowell. The inscription on Butler&#x27;s monument reads, &quot;the true touchstone of civil liberty is not that all men are equal but that every man has the right to be the equal of every other man—if he can.&quot;

His daughter Blanche married Adelbert Ames, a Mississippi governor and senator who had served as a general in the Union Army during the war. Butler&#x27;s descendants include the scientist Adelbert Ames Jr., suffragist and artist Blanche Ames Ames, Butler Ames, Hope Butler, and George Plimpton.

==Legacy==
According to biographer Hans L. Trefousse:

Butler was one of the most controversial 19th-century American politicians. Demagogue, speculator, military bungler, and sharp legal practitioner—he was all of these; and he also was a fearless advocate of justice for the downtrodden, a resourceful military administrator, and an astonishing innovator. He was passionately hated and equally strongly admired, and if the South called him &quot;Beast,&quot; his constituents in Massachusetts were fascinated by him... As a leading advocate of radical Reconstruction, Butler played an important role in the conflict between president and Congress. His effectiveness was marred by the frequency with which engaged in personal altercations, and his conduct as one of the principal managers of the impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson was dubious. Nevertheless he deserves recognition as a persistent critic of southern terrorism and is one of the chief authors of the Civil Rights Act of 1875.

Black newspapers eulogized him &quot;consistently as a &#x27;friend of the colored race,&#x27; &#x27;a staunch and enthusiastic advocate&#x27; of Black progress, and &#x27;one of the few American statesmen who have stood as a wall of defense in favor of equal rights for all American citizens.&#x27; ... The &quot;New England Torchlight&quot; put it simply: &#x27;The white South hated him. The black South loved him.

==Ideology (&quot;Butlerism&quot;)==
Butlerism was a political term in the United States during the Gilded Age applied as a pejorative by its opponents that referred to the political causes of Butler. A populist movement, it was criticized for its &quot;spirit of the European mob,&quot; and appealed to support for women&#x27;s suffrage, Irish nationalism, an eight-hour work day, monetary inflation, and the usage of greenbacks to pay off the national debt.

The ideology and political themes of Butlerism, which opposed civil service reform, advocated inflationary monetary policy, and assailed capitalism as exploiting workmen, clashed with the aims of liberal reformers in the Gilded Age. Its left-wing stances on monetary policy came at odds with the considerably more conservative members of the Republican Party, including Ulysses S. Grant and James G. Blaine. When Butler and Democratic congressman George H. Pendleton led a bipartisan wing of inflationists advocating the continued usage of greenbacks, Blaine emerged as the first member of Congress antagonizing the repudiation theory. After President Grant in 1874 vetoed Butler&#x27;s &quot;inflation bill,&quot; &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; published a cartoon by Thomas Nast depicting Grant, a supporter of sound money, as having &quot;bottled up&quot; Butlerism.

In spite of Butlerism&#x27;s radical elements during its time, Butler during the presidency of Rutherford B. Hayes was closely aligned with the politics of the conservative Stalwart faction in his support for Ulysses S. Grant, due to their shared concern for civil rights, tendency to &quot;wave the bloody shirt,&quot; and antipathy towards the hardline civil service reform efforts. These aims were in turn harshly lamented by reformers, including Charles Francis Adams Jr., and Carl Schurz.

Opponents of Butler derided the ideology as involving &quot;no principle which is elevating, it inspires no sentiment which is ennobling.&quot; In turn, defenders of Butlerism retorted:
Attacks on Butlerism included one by Kentucky Democrat John Y. Brown in February 1874, who complained: &quot;If I wished to describe all that was pusillanimous in war, inhuman in peace, forbidden in morals, and infamous in politics, I should call it &#x27;Butlerism. Brown subsequently faced a censure for his remarks, and bickering on the House floor soon followed.

<text>The oprichnina (, ) was a state policy implemented by Tsar Ivan the Terrible in Russia between 1565 and 1572. The policy included mass repression of the boyars (Russian aristocrats), including public executions and confiscation of their land and property. In this context the term can also refer to:

*The notorious organization of six thousand Oprichniki, the first political police in the history of Russia.
*The portion of Russia, ruled directly by Ivan the Terrible, where his Oprichniki operated.
*The corresponding period of Russian history.

The term &quot;oprichnina&quot;, which Ivan coined for this policy, derives from the Russian word &quot;oprich&quot; ( &#x27;apart from&#x27;, &#x27;except&#x27;).

==Causes==
In 1558, Tsar Ivan IV started the Livonian War. A broad coalition, which included Poland, Lithuania and Sweden, became drawn into the war against Russia. The war became drawn-out (it continued until 1583) and expensive; raids by Crimean Tatars, Polish and Lithuanian invasions, famines, a trading blockade and escalating costs of war ravaged Russia.

In 1564, Prince Andrey Kurbsky defected to the Lithuanians and commanded the Lithuanian army against Russia, devastating the Russian region of Velikiye Luki. Tsar Ivan began to suspect other aristocrats of readiness to betray him.

Historians Vasily Klyuchevsky (1841–1911) and (1876–1952) explained the oprichnina in terms of Ivan&#x27;s paranoia and denied larger social aims for the oprichnina. However, historian Sergey Platonov (1860–1933) argued that Ivan IV intended the oprichnina as a suppression of the rising boyar aristocracy. Professor Isabel De Madariaga (1919–2014) expanded this idea to explain the oprichnina as Ivan&#x27;s attempt to subordinate all independent social classes to the autocracy.

== Establishment ==
On December 3, 1564, Ivan IV departed Moscow on pilgrimage. While such journeys were routine for the throne, Ivan neglected to set in place the usual arrangements for rule in his absence. Moreover, an unusually large personal guard, a significant number of boyars, and the treasury accompanied him.

After a month of silence, Ivan finally issued two letters from his fortifications at Aleksandrova Sloboda on January 3, 1565. The first addressed the elite of Moscow and accused them of embezzlement and treason. Further accusations concerned the clergy and their protection of denounced boyars. In conclusion, Ivan announced his abdication. The second letter addressed the population of Moscow and claimed &quot;he had no anger against&quot; its citizenry. Divided between Aleksandrova Sloboda and Moscow, the boyar court was unable to rule in the absence of Ivan and feared the wrath of the Muscovite citizenry. Envoys departed for Aleksandrova Sloboda to beg Ivan to return to the throne.

Ivan IV agreed to return on condition that he might prosecute people for treason outside legal limitations. He demanded the right to execute and confiscate the land of traitors without interference from the boyar council or from the church. To pursue his investigations, Ivan decreed the establishment of the oprichnina (originally a term for land left to a noble widow, separate from her children&#x27;s land). He also raised a levy of 100,000 rubles to pay for the oprichnina.

==Organization==
The oprichnina consisted of a separate territory within the borders of Russia, mostly in the territory of the former Novgorod Republic in the north. This region included many of the financial centers of the state, including the salt region of Staraya Russa and prominent merchant towns. Ivan held exclusive power over the oprichnina territory. The Boyar Council ruled the zemshchina (&#x27;land&#x27;), the second division of the state. Until 1568, the oprichnina relied upon many administrative institutions under zemshchina jurisdiction. Only when conflict between the zemshchina and oprichnina reached its peak did Ivan create independent institutions within the oprichnina.

Ivan also stipulated the creation of a personal guard known as the oprichniki. Originally it was a thousand strong. The noble oprichniki Aleksei Basmanov and Afanasy Viazemsky oversaw recruitment. Nobles and townsmen free of relations to the zemshchina or its administration were eligible for Ivan’s new guard. Henri Troyat has emphasized the lowly origin of the oprichnina recruits. However, historian Vladimir Kobrin has contested that a shift to the lower classes constituted a late development in the oprichnina era. Many early oprichniki had close ties to the princely and boyar clans of Russia.

Territorial divisions under the oprichnina led to mass resettlement. When the property of zemshchina nobles fell within oprichnina territory, oprichniki seized their lands and forced the owners onto zemshchina land. The oprichnina territory included primarily service estates. Alexander Zimin and Stepan Veselovsky have argued that this division left hereditary landownership largely unaffected. However, Platonov and other scholars have posited that resettlement aimed to undermine the power of the landed nobility. Pavlov has cited the relocation of zemshchina servicemen from oprichnina territories onto heredity estates as a critical blow to the power of the princely class. The division of hereditary estates diminished the influence of the princely elites in their native provinces. The worst affected was the province of Suzdal which lost 80% of its gentry.

The oprichniki enjoyed social and economic privileges under the oprichnina. While zemshchina boyars lost both hereditary and service land, the oprichniki retained hereditary holdings that fell in zemshchina land. Moreover, Ivan granted the oprichnina the spoils of a heavy tax levied upon the zemshchina nobles. The rising oprichniki owed their allegiance to Ivan, not heredity or local bonds.

==Operations==

The first wave of persecutions targeted primarily the princely clans of Russia, notably the influential families of Suzdal. Ivan executed, exiled, or tortured prominent members of the boyar clans on questionable accusations of conspiracy. 1566 saw the oprichnina extended to eight central districts. Of the 12,000 nobles there, 570 became oprichniks, and the rest were expelled. They had to make their way to the zemshchina in mid-winter; peasants who helped them were executed. In a show of clemency, Ivan recalled a number of nobles to Moscow. The Tsar even called upon zemshchina nobles for a zemskii sobor concerning the Livonian War. Ivan posed the question whether Russia should surrender the Livonian territories to recently victorious Lithuania or maintain the effort to conquer the region. The body approved war measures and advanced emergency taxes to support the draining treasury.

However, the zemskii sobor also forwarded a petition to end the oprichnina. The Tsar reacted with a renewal of the oprichnina terror. He ordered the immediate arrest of the petitioners and executed the alleged leaders of the protest. Further investigations tied Ivan Federov, leader of the zemshchina duma, to a plot to overthrow Tsar Ivan; Federov was removed from court and executed shortly thereafter.

The overthrow of King Erik XIV of Sweden in 1568 and the death of Ivan&#x27;s second wife in 1569 exacerbated Ivan&#x27;s suspicions. His attention turned to the northwestern city of Novgorod. The second largest city in Russia, Novgorod housed a large service nobility with ties to some of the condemned boyar families of Moscow. Despite the sack of the city under Ivan III, Novgorod maintained a political organization removed from Russia’s central administration. Moreover, the influence of the city in the northeast had increased as the city fronted the military advance against the Lithuanian border. The treasonous surrender of the border town Izborsk to Lithuania also caused Ivan to question the faith of border towns.

Ivan IV and an oprichniki detachment instituted a month-long terror in Novgorod (the Massacre of Novgorod). The oprichniki raided the town and conducted executions among all classes. As the Livonian campaign constituted a significant drain on state resources, Ivan targeted ecclesiastical and merchant holdings with particular fervor. After Novgorod, the oprichniki company turned to the adjacent merchant city Pskov. The city received relatively merciful treatment. The oprichniki limited executions and focused primarily upon the seizure of ecclesiastical wealth. According to a popular apocryphal account, Nicholas Salos of Pskov the fool-for-Christ prophesied the fall of Ivan and thus motivated the deeply religious Tsar to spare the city. Alternatively, Ivan may have felt no need to institute a terror in Pskov due to his prior sack of the city in wake of the Izborsk treason. The dire financial condition of the state and the need to bolster the war treasury likely inspired the second raid.

The persecutions began to target the oprichnina leadership itself. The tsar had already refused Basmanov and Viazemsky participation in the Novgorod campaign. Upon his return, Ivan condemned the two to prison, where they died shortly thereafter. Pavlov links Ivan&#x27;s turn against the higher echelons of oprichniki to the increasing number of the lower-born among their ranks. Ivan may have reacted to the apparent discontent among the princely oprichniki over the brutal treatment of Novgorod. Furthermore, class disparity may have set the lower recruits against the princely oprichniki. As Ivan already suspected the older oprichniki on the issue of Novgorod, the lower-born recruits may have advanced the new persecutions to increase their influence in the oprichnina hierarchy.

==Disbandment==
1572 saw the fall of the oprichnina state structure. The zemshchina and oprichnina territories were reunited and placed under rule of a reformed Boyar Council, which included members from both sides of the divided apparatus.

Scholars have cited diverse factors to explain the dissolution of the oprichnina. When the Crimean Tatars burnt Moscow in 1571 during the Russo-Crimean War, the oprichniki failed to offer serious resistance. The success of the Tatars may have shaken the Tsar&#x27;s faith in the effectiveness of the oprichnina. Ivan may have found state division ineffective in a period of war and its significant social and economic pressures. Alternatively, Ivan may have deemed the oprichnina a success; the weakening of the princely elite having been achieved, the Tsar may have felt that the terror had simply outlived its usefulness.

==Legacy==

Scholar Robert O. Crummey and Platonov have emphasized the social impact of the mass resettlements under the oprichnina. The division of large estates into smaller oprichnik plots subjected the peasants to a stricter landowning dominion. Furthermore, a new itinerant population emerged as state terror and the seizure of lands forced many peasants from their lands. The increase in itinerants may have motivated the ultimate institutionalization of serfdom by the Russian throne. The oprichnina coincided with the major social and economic crisis in Russia and, according to some contemporary and historical accounts, contributed to it.

Historian Isabel de Madariaga has emphasized the role of the oprichnina in the consolidation of aristocratic power. Resettlement drastically reduced the power of the hereditary nobility. Oprichniki landowners who owed their loyalty to the throne replaced an aristocracy that might have evolved independent political ambitions. Alternatively, Crummey has summarized the social effects of the oprichnina as a failure. From this perspective, the oprichnina failed to pursue coherent social motives and instead pursued a largely unfocused terror. Such interpretations are derived from the 1960s works by Ruslan Skrynnikov who described the Oprichnina as the reign of terror designed to root out every possible challenge to the autocracy:

==Cultural depictions==
Ivan Lazhechnikov wrote the tragedy &quot;The Oprichniki&quot; (), on which Tchaikovsky based his opera &quot;The Oprichnik&quot;. In turn, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s opera inspired a 1911 painting by Apollinary Vasnetsov, depicting a city street and people fleeing in panic at the arrival of the oprichniki.

A fantasy variation on the Oprichnina appears in the Japanese light novel franchise &quot;Gate&quot;. It retains the name, purpose, activities, dog head motif, and even the use of brooms from the historic original.

Vladimir Sorokin&#x27;s 2006 novel &quot;Day of the Oprichnik&quot; envisions a dystopian near future in which the Russian monarchy and oprichnina have been reestablished. The novel&#x27;s oprichnina drive red cars with severed dog heads as hood ornaments, rape and kill dissenting nobles, and consume massive amounts of alcohol and narcotics, all while praising the monarchy and the Russian Orthodox Church.

<text>Wallace Rider Farrington (May 3, 1871 – October 6, 1933) was an American journalist who served as the sixth Territorial Governor of Hawaii, serving from 1921 to 1929. Prior to his term, he was editor of &quot;The Honolulu Advertiser&quot; and &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; newspapers.

==Life==
Farrington was born in Orono on May 3, 1871. He graduated the University of Maine in 1891. An avid traveler, he found himself in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1894 and was persuaded to stay to become the editor of the &quot;Honolulu Advertiser&quot;. He left the newspaper after three years of service to become the editor of the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot;. Interested in local politics, he was elected Mayor of Honolulu.

In 1915, Farrington organized the Honolulu Ad Club. One of his invited guest speakers was Warren Harding, a Republican Senator from Ohio. Farrington introduced Harding as &quot;the future president of the United States.&quot; Harding replied that if Farrington&#x27;s prediction came true, he would name Farrington governor of the Territory of Hawaii.

Three months after taking office as U.S. President in 1921, Harding fulfilled his promise, appointing Farrington as the Territorial Governor of Hawaii. His tenure was controversial, as he followed the previous Governor in favouring the Whites. 
Farrington served as a Republican through 1929 when he retired from public life. Suffering from heart disease, he died on October 6, 1933.

Farrington was memorialized with the dedication of Wallace Rider Farrington High School in the historic Kalihi district of Honolulu. The school adopted &quot;The Governors&quot; as its nickname and mascot, in honor of the school&#x27;s namesake. Also named after him are Farrington Street in lower Manoa Valley, Farrington Highway which stretches from Pearl City to the leeward coast of Oahu, and Farrington Hall (demolished in the 1970s) at the University of Hawaii, Manoa where he served as chairman of the University of Hawaii Board of Regents from 1914 to 1920.

==Family==
Farrington was the father of Joseph Rider Farrington, a member of the Senate of the Territory of Hawaii and the territory&#x27;s delegate to the United States Congress. Joseph Farrington died in office and was succeeded by his wife, Mary Elizabeth Pruett Farrington, who carried on the Farrington name. He was buried in Oahu Cemetery.

<doc id="732968" wikidata="Q927315" url="?curid=732968" title="The Human Equation">
<text>The Human Equation is the sixth album from the progressive rock project Ayreon by Dutch musician Arjen Anthony Lucassen, released on 25 May 2004 via Inside Out Music. As with other Ayreon albums, it features guest appearances from several musicians previously unrelated to the project, including James LaBrie of Dream Theater, Mikael Åkerfeldt of Opeth, Eric Clayton of Saviour Machine, and Devin Townsend, performing music arranged and written by Lucassen.

As with nearly every Ayreon album, it is a concept album with each character being portrayed by one singer. However unlike previous albums, &quot;The Human Equation&quot; is not a sci-fi story but takes place almost entirely in the mind of a character called Me (played by LaBrie) who is in a coma after a car crash, with each song consisting of one day spent in coma. While his Wife (Marcela Bovio) and Best Friend (Lucassen) are at his side in the real world, Me, trapped in his own mind, encounters representations of his own feelings and recalls his life from his childhood to his crash.

The album was released in three different editions: a regular edition with two CDs, a Special Edition with two CDs and a DVD, and a Limited Deluxe Edition with two CDs, a DVD and a 36-page booklet. The album peaked at #7 at Dutch Albums Chart and at #50 at Germany Albums Top 50. The album was also released on vinyl in December 2012.

&quot;The Human Equation&quot; is one of the few Ayreon albums in which Lucassen did not write all the lyrics (the others are &quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot; and &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot;): Townsend wrote all lyrics for his character Rage, while Heather Findlay of Mostly Autumn and Devon Graves of Deadsoul Tribe also wrote some of the lyrics for their characters, Love and Agony. The albums marks the first collaboration between Lucassen and Bovio, selected by Lucassen via an internet female singing contest to play Wife. The following year, Bovio and Lucassen created together progressive/symphonic metal band Stream of Passion.

==Concept and storyline==
The album explores the idea of psychological rebirth, and follows the story of a man who, after falling into a coma following a car crash, is confronted with his past, his emotions, and his current situation as he lays trapped inside his own mind. The circumstances surrounding the crash are mysterious, as the man (&quot;Me&quot;, portrayed by James LaBrie) ploughed into a tree on a deserted road in broad daylight. Following this, he slips into a twenty-day coma, with each day represented by a single song. Each song follows a slightly different format, though there are major common themes, such as the presence of Me&#x27;s manifest emotions in his dream world including Fear (Mikael Åkerfeldt), Reason (Eric Clayton), and Pride (Magnus Ekwall); the presence of Me&#x27;s Wife (Marcela Bovio) and Best Friend (Arjen Anthony Lucassen) at his bedside; and the past events that Me is forced to reflect on.

The plot builds from Me’s early broken state to his eventual rebirth as a new and better man. His own dark past, in which he suffered beneath an abusive Father (Mike Baker), was driven to become merciless by school bullies, and eventually betrayed his closest friend for his own benefit; is intertwined with the plot surrounding Wife and Best Friend, eventually revealing the cause of the crash: Me had witnessed the two sharing an intimate moment, and had swerved his car into a tree in his despair. The three eventually come clean and forgive each other, leading Me to conquer his negative emotions and escape his nightmarish prison.

The story terminates with a sci-fi twist in contrast to the psychodrama of the album, but reminiscent of earlier Ayreon releases. The final song cuts suddenly to silence as it crescendoes to a climax, and a computerised voice announces the shut-down of the Dream Sequencer. The voice of Forever of the Stars then speaks the final words of the album (&quot;Emotions...I remember...&quot;), tying its events into the overall Ayreon plot that began with &quot;The Final Experiment&quot;.

<doc id="732971" wikidata="Q59783" url="?curid=732971" title="Dekalog">
<text>Dekalog (, also known as Dekalog: The Ten Commandments and The Decalogue) is a 1989 Polish drama television miniseries directed by Krzysztof Kieślowski and co-written by Kieślowski with Krzysztof Piesiewicz, with music by Zbigniew Preisner. It consists of ten one-hour films, inspired by the decalogue of the Ten Commandments. Each installment explores characters facing one or several moral or ethical dilemmas as they reside in an austere housing project in 1980s Poland.

Exhibited in its entirety at the 46th Venice International Film Festival, the series, Kieślowski&#x27;s most acclaimed work, was said in 2002 to be &quot;the best dramatic work ever done specifically for television&quot; and has won numerous international awards, though it did not receive wide release outside Europe until the late 1990s. It is one of fifteen films listed in the category &quot;Values&quot; on the Vatican film list. In 1991, filmmaker Stanley Kubrick wrote an admiring foreword to the published screenplay, wherein &quot;Dekalog&quot; is the only masterpiece he could think of.

==Production==
The series was conceived when screenwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz, who had seen a 15th-century artwork illustrating the Commandments in scenes from that time period, suggested the idea of a modern equivalent. Filmmaker Krzysztof Kieślowski was interested in the philosophical challenge, and also wanted to use the series as a portrait of the hardships of Polish society, while deliberately avoiding the political issues he had depicted in earlier films. He originally meant to hire ten different directors, but decided to direct the films himself. He used a different cinematographer for each episode except III and IX, in both of which Piotr Sobociński was director of photography.

The large cast includes both famous and unknown actors, many of whom Kieślowski also used in his other films. Typically for Kieślowski, the tone of most of the films is melancholic, except for the final one, which is a black comedy, featuring two of the same actors, Jerzy Stuhr and Zbigniew Zamachowski, as in &quot;Three Colors: White&quot;.

==Themes==
The ten films are titled simply by number, e.g. &quot;Dekalog: One&quot;. According to film critic Roger Ebert&#x27;s introduction to the DVD set, Kieślowski said that the films did not correspond exactly to the commandments, and never used their names himself. Though each film is independent, most of them share the same setting in Warsaw, and some of the characters are acquainted with each other. Each short film explores characters facing one or several moral or ethical dilemmas as they live in a large housing project in 1980s Poland. The themes can be interpreted in many different ways; however, each film has its own literality:

===Recurring character of Artur Barciś===
A nameless character played by Polish actor Artur Barciś appears in all but episodes 7 and 10. He observes the main characters at key moments, and never intervenes. 

===Milk===
Milk is a recurring element in the following 7 episodes:

==Cast and cinematography by episode==
==Reception==
 It won the 1991 BAFTA TV Award for Best International Programme and the Bodil Award for Best European Film. The film also won the &quot;Best Foreign Film&quot; award from French Syndicate of Cinema Critics.

The series was praised by renowned film critics including Roger Ebert and Robert Fulford, as well as important figures from the film industry, such as Stanley Kubrick.

In the 2002 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll to determine the greatest films of all time, &quot;Dekalog&quot; and &quot;A Short Film About Killing&quot; received votes from 4 critics and 3 directors, including Ebert, New Yorker critic David Denby, and director Mira Nair. Additionally, in the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll held the same year to determine the top 10 films of the previous 25 years, Kieslowski was named #2 on the list of Top Directors, with votes for his films being split between &quot;Dekalog,&quot; &quot;Three Colors Red/Blue&quot;, and &quot;The Double Life of Veronique&quot;.
In the 2012 polls &quot;Dekalog&quot; received six votes from critics including Kenneth Turan and one vote from director Milcho Manchevski as the &quot;Greatest Film of All Time&quot;.

&quot;The Village Voice&quot; ranked &quot;The Decalogue&quot; at No. 112 in its Top 250 &quot;Best Films of the Century&quot; list in 1999, based on a poll of critics. In January 2002, the film was listed among the Top 100 &quot;Essential Films&quot; of all time by the National Society of Film Critics. The film ranked #36 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; in 2010.

In a 2025 Criterion Closet Video, Director Brady Corbet called &quot;The Decalogue&quot; &quot;[M]aybe the greatest achievement in the history of cinema.&quot;

==Longer feature films==
Kieślowski expanded &quot;Five&quot; and &quot;Six&quot; into longer feature films (&quot;A Short Film About Killing&quot; and &quot;A Short Film About Love&quot;), using the same cast and changing the stories slightly. This was part of a contractual obligation with the producers, since feature films were easier to distribute outside Poland. In 2000, the series was released on five DVDs, each containing two parts of about 2 hours.

<text>Gilles Caouette (; February 16, 1940 – August 13, 2009) was a Canadian politician and member of Parliament.

Caouette was born in Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec. His father, Réal Caouette, was a prominent Social Credit politician, and leader of the &quot;Ralliement créditiste&quot; and later the Social Credit Party of Canada.

Gilles followed in his father’s footsteps, and ran unsuccessfully for election to the House of Commons of Canada as a &quot;Ralliement créditiste&quot; or Social Credit candidate three times (1963, 1964 and 1965). He finally won election from Charlevoix in the 1972 election with a margin of 159 votes.

Gilles was defeated in the 1974 election, and in a 1975 by-election in Hochelaga.

His father died in 1976, resulting in a by-election in the Témiscamingue riding that his father had held since 1962. Gilles won the May 24, 1977 by-election, and returned to the House of Commons. On June 24, 1977, Réal’s successor as Social Credit party leader, André-Gilles Fortin, died at the age of 33. Gilles became acting party leader on June 29. He had intended to run at the party&#x27;s leadership convention but refused to run and resigned as interim leader when the party&#x27;s executive council decided to hold the convention earlier rather than later and hold it in Winnipeg, Manitoba instead of Quebec where most party members (and all of its Members of Parliament) lived. He was replaced as interim leader by Charles-Arthur Gauthier.

Caouette ran in the 1979 election but lost his seat in the House of Commons.

Outside politics he worked as an administrator, draftsman, research director, and as a technician.

<text>Joseph Rider Farrington (October 15, 1897 – June 19, 1954) was an American newspaper editor and statesman who served in the United States Congress as delegate for the Territory of Hawai&#x27;i.

==Education and military career==
Farrington was born in Washington, D.C., to Wallace Rider Farrington, the future Territorial Governor of Hawai&#x27;i. While still an infant, he moved to Honolulu, Hawai&#x27;i with his parents where his father began work as an editor for the &quot;Honolulu Advertiser&quot; and later the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; newspapers. Farrington attended Punahou School and, upon graduating, studied at the University of Wisconsin. He dropped out of college in June 1918 to enlist in the United States Army. He was commissioned a second lieutenant of field artillery in September 1918 and discharged the following December. He returned to the University of Wisconsin–Madison and graduated in 1919.

==Newspaper career==
As soon as he obtained his degree in Wisconsin, Farrington became a reporter on the staff of the &quot;Public Ledger&quot; in Philadelphia. He served three years as a member of its Washington bureau. He then returned to Honolulu to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps and entered the newspaper business. He became a reporter and then editor of the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot;. In 1939, Farrington succeeded his father to become president and general manager of the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot;, an office in which he served until his death.

==Political career==
Farrington began a part-time political career as secretary to the Hawai&#x27;i Legislative Commission in 1933. The following year he was elected to the Hawaii Territorial Senate, an office he served in through 1942. On January 3, 1943, Farrington was sworn in as a Republican delegate to Congress. Farrington was a supporter of Hawaiian statehood and help advise the early post-war efforts for admission. He died in office in Washington, D.C., on June 19, 1954, of an apparent heart attack. His wife, Elizabeth P. Farrington, was elected to replace him in Congress. Farrington was buried in the Oahu Cemetery in Nuuanu Valley in Honolulu.

<text>Croxteth is a suburb of Liverpool, Merseyside, England, and a Liverpool City Council Ward. Although housing in the area is predominantly modern, the suburb has some notable history. At the 2011 census it had a population of 14,561.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Croxteth&quot; appears to be of Old Norse origin. The name appears to mean &quot;Croc&#x27;s landing place&quot; or &quot;river-bend landing place&quot;, derived from the elements &quot;Croc&quot; (personal name) or Old Norse &quot;krókr&quot; (&quot;river-bend&quot;) + Norse &quot;stǫð&quot; (&quot;landing-place, jetty&quot;). Or else, the second element may be &quot;staðr&quot; (&quot;place&quot;).

==History==

The suburb is in the north of Liverpool and borders Norris Green, Gilmoss, Fazakerley and West Derby. The &quot;Dog and Gun&quot; public house (demolished in 2005) was a historic hostelry, likely associated with the hunt from Croxteth Hall.

The first tranche of housing in Croxteth was built to rehouse families from the Scotland Road area of the city that was subject to mass demolition during the construction of the second Mersey Tunnel. Within the past twenty years very large areas of Croxteth Park and a City Council playing field have been sold for housing development to create a huge housing estate, noted for its lack of local amenities. 

From the A580 road (the Liverpool-East Lancashire Road, abbreviated to and known commonly as East Lancs Road) passing Malpas Road to St. Swithens including the much talked about haunting of Gillmoss School. Croxteth was one of the first &quot;suburbs of Liverpool&quot;.
The first houses in the Croxteth estate were in fact built in the immediate post war period to house skilled workers from Slough and Rugby who had been brought in to the English Electric and Napier factories (on the East Lancs Road), and families from the dockland inner-city areas who had lost their homes through bombing and slum demolition. The second tunnel came much later. The first families arrived in 1951 to live in an estate that was without roads, pavements, shops, pubs or buses. However, in the wake of World War II during the late 1940s and early 1950s, massive residential extensions at Croxteth, alongside similar and indistinguishable development of neighbouring Norris Green, resulted in what together, are now regarded as the largest municipal housing estate in Europe.

==Transport==

Croxteth is close to the &quot;A580 East Lancashire Road&quot;, to the north, and the M57 motorway.

The area is served by the Merseytravel bus routes to Liverpool City Centre, Page Moss, Broadgreen Hospital, Fazakerley Hospital and Knowsley Industrial Estate.

The nearest station is Fazakerley railway station, approximately away in on the Kirkby branch of Merseyrail&#x27;s Northern Line.

A proposed light rail system, Merseytram was intended to serve Croxteth. Approved in 2002, it would have linked Kirkby and Croxteth to Liverpool City Centre via West Derby, West Derby Road, the Royal Liverpool University Hospital and a city centre loop. The &quot;Merseytram Line 1 Transport and Works Act&quot; was approved by the then Secretary of State for Transport Alistair Darling in December 2004 and construction of the route was expected to begin with the &quot;M-Pact&quot; consortium of GrantRail and Laing O’Rourke selected to do so from 2005. However, due to cost overruns and other associated difficulties, the scheme was cancelled in November 2009.

==Education==
The area is serviced by two secondary schools (11–18); Dixons Croxteth Academy (mixed) and St John Bosco Arts College (Catholic Girls). In 2010, a third school, Croxteth Community Comprehensive (Mixed), closed due to poor academic standards and falling pupils numbers, despite local protests and the school achieving higher academic standards in OFSTED reports and on average higher student grades than De La Salle. In June 2008 it was revealed a new £20m &quot;super-school&quot; would be built on the site of De La Salle. However, this proposal has since been scrapped.

==Notable residents==
Former England footballer Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen (née McLoughlin) grew up and met in the area. Coleen was a pupil at St John Bosco School and Wayne attended De La Salle School (now Dixons Croxteth Academy).

One-time England footballer Francis Jeffers also attended De La Salle School.

Distance runner Robert Pope, who became the first person to complete the 15,600-mile Forrest Gump run, was born and raised in the area.

<doc id="732984" wikidata="Q185112" url="?curid=732984" title="1349 (band)">
<text>1349 is a Norwegian black metal band from Oslo, Norway, formed in 1997. The band&#x27;s name is a reference to the year the Black Death reached Norway.

== History ==
1349 formed in 1997 and comprises several former members of the band Alvheim. Drummer Frost is also a member of Satyricon.

In recognition of 1349&#x27;s influences, the band performed a cover of Mayhem&#x27;s &quot;Buried by Time and Dust&quot; on their debut album, &quot;Liberation&quot;. At 1349&#x27;s live shows, the band has also covered Celtic Frost, whom vocalist Ravn cites as his principal influence.

1349 tours on a regular basis. The band&#x27;s live shows often begin with Frost and guitarist Archaon breathing fire. In 2006, 1349 toured the US with Celtic Frost. Ravn also appeared on the Celtic Frost album &quot;Monotheist&quot; (2006), performing guest vocals on the CD digipack bonus track, &quot;Temple of Depression&quot;. In 2007, during the French Hellfest festival, 1349 was slated to play during the day, but asked to reschedule their appearance to play in the dark instead. During 1349&#x27;s appearance at the Oslo Inferno Metal Festival in March 2008, the band was joined on stage by Celtic Frost frontman Tom Gabriel Fischer for a rendition of the Celtic Frost song &quot;The Usurper&quot;. In September 2008, 1349 toured with Carcass, Suffocation, Aborted and Rotten Sound on the Exhume to Consume Tour.

A music video for &quot;Sculptor of Flesh&quot; was made following the release of &quot;Hellfire&quot; (2005). The video, directed by Judd Tilyard, alternates between footage of the band performing the song in Norway and clips of surgery filmed in Australia.

During late 2008, 1349 recorded its fourth album, &quot;Revelations of the Black Flame&quot;. The album was co-mixed by Tom Gabriel Fischer, and was released in Europe on 25 May 2009. &quot;Revelations of the Black Flame&quot; marked a change in direction for the band, as songs on the album were slower than previous releases, and there were also some dark ambient and industrial-tinged tracks.

At the beginning of 2010 the band signed a contract with Indie Recordings for the release of its fifth album in Europe, with Prosthetic Records distributing the album in North America.

1349 toured with Cannibal Corpse, Skeletonwitch, and Lecherous Nocturne on the Evisceration Plague Tour, in April–May 2010. The band also performed at the Wacken Open Air and Summer Breeze Open Air festivals in August 2010.

1349 released its fifth album, &quot;Demonoir&quot;, on 26 April 2010. The album shows a return to 1349&#x27;s earlier sound, before &quot;Revelations of the Black Flame&quot;, while continuing the low-fi production and ambient sensibilities of &quot;Revelations&quot;. 1349 toured Canada and the United States with Tom Gabriel Fischer&#x27;s project Triptykon in October 2010. A deluxe box set of &quot;Demonoir&quot; was released in October 2011. The band&#x27;s first live DVD, titled &quot;Hellvetia Fire – The Official 1349 Bootleg&quot;, was released on 24 October 2011 by Candlelight Records. It was filmed at Bikini Test La Chaux De Fonds in Switzerland in 2005.

In October 2013, the band began recording their sixth studio album, called &quot;Massive Cauldron of Chaos&quot;. On 10 December, the band announced that the record was finished, and it was released on 29 September 2014, via Indie Recordings.

In February 2017, it was announced that 1349 have now signed to Season of Mist and are now said to be in the process of writing their seventh studio album, which is set to be released in 2019. The first new single from the as yet untitled new album, &#x27;Dødskamp&#x27; was released digitally on 14 January 2019. On 31 July 2019 it was revealed that the band&#x27;s seventh Studio album would be titled &#x27;The Infernal Pathway&#x27;. It was released on 18 October 2019. According to recent updates on the band’s instagram profile in April 2024, they are now in the process of recording their eighth studio album. On 3 May, 2024 the band released the first single from their upcoming album titled ‘Ash of Ages’. On 9 July 2024, they released a second track ‘Shadow Point’ as well as full details of their eighth studio album, which will be titled ‘The Wolf &amp; the King’, and was released on October 4, 2024.

<doc id="732989" wikidata="Q1373874" url="?curid=732989" title="Speech disfluency">
<text>A speech disfluency, also spelled speech dysfluency, is any of various breaks, irregularities, or non-lexical vocables which occur within the flow of otherwise fluent speech. These include &quot;false starts&quot;, i.e. words and sentences that are cut off mid-utterance; phrases that are restarted or repeated, and repeated syllables; &quot;fillers&quot;, i.e. grunts, and non-lexical or semiarticulate utterances such as &quot;huh&quot;, &quot;uh&quot;, &quot;erm&quot;, &quot;um&quot;, and &quot;hmm&quot;, and, in English, &quot;well&quot;, &quot;so&quot;, &quot;I mean&quot;, and &quot;like&quot;; and &quot;repaired&quot; utterances, i.e. instances of speakers correcting their own slips of the tongue or mispronunciations (before anyone else gets a chance to). &quot;Huh&quot; is claimed to be a universal syllable.

==Definition==
A disfluence or nonfluence is a non-pathological hesitance when speaking, the use of fillers (“like” or “uh”), or the repetition of a word or phrase. This needs to be distinguished from a fluency disorder like stuttering with an interruption of fluency of speech, accompanied by &quot;excessive tension, speaking avoidance, struggle behaviors, and secondary mannerism&quot;.

== Fillers ==

Fillers are parts of speech which are not generally recognized as purposeful or containing formal meaning, usually expressed as pauses such as &quot;uh&quot;, &quot;like&quot; and &quot;er&quot;, but also extending to repairs (&quot;He was wearing a black—uh, I mean a blue, a blue shirt&quot;), and articulation problems such as stuttering. Use is normally frowned upon in mass media such as news reports or films, but they occur regularly in everyday conversation, sometimes representing upwards of 20% of &quot;words&quot; in conversation. Fillers can also be used as a pause for thought (&quot;I arrived at, um—3 o&#x27;clock&quot;), and when used in this function are called hesitation markers or planners.

== Language-dependence ==
Research in computational linguistics has revealed a correlation between native language and patterns of disfluencies in spontaneously uttered speech. Besides that research, there are other subjective accounts reported by individuals.

According to one commentator, Americans use pauses such as &quot;um&quot; or &quot;em&quot;, the Irish commonly use the pause &quot;em&quot;, the British say &quot;uh&quot; or &quot;eh&quot;, the French use , the Germans say (pronounced &quot;eh&quot; or &quot;er&quot;), the Dutch use , Japanese use ああ , あのう or ええと , the Spanish say (also used in Hebrew) and (normally meaning &#x27;like&#x27;), and Latin Americans but not the Spanish use (normally meaning &#x27;this&#x27;). Besides and , the Portuguese use or .

In Mandarin, and are used, meaning &#x27;that&#x27; or &#x27;this&#x27;, respectively. Arabic speakers say , the pronunciation of which is close to &quot;yaa&#x27;ni&quot;, or , (literally &#x27;he means&#x27;; there is no grammatical gender-neutral third person) and Turkish say in addition to (without the found in Arabic) and .

Despite the differences between languages, pause fillers in different languages often sound similar because they tend to be the easiest and most neutral vowel sounds to make (such as the schwa), i.e the sounds that can be pronounced with a relaxed tongue or jaw.

== Research ==
Recent linguistic research has suggested that non-pathological disfluencies may contain a variety of meaning; the frequency of &quot;uh&quot; and &quot;um&quot; in English is often reflective of a speaker&#x27;s alertness or emotional state. Some have hypothesized that the time of an &quot;uh&quot; or &quot;um&quot; is used for the planning of future words; other researchers have suggested that they are actually to be understood as full-fledged function words rather than accidents, indicating a delay of variable time in which the speaker wishes to pause without voluntarily yielding control of the dialogue. There is some debate as to whether to consider them a form of noise or as a meaning-filled part of language, but disfluency can improve language understanding by signalling that the speaker may be about to say something new or complex.

==&quot;Hmm&quot;==
Hmm is an exclamation (an emphatic interjection) typically used to express reflection, uncertainty, thoughtful absorption, or hesitation. Hmm is technically categorized as an interjection, like &quot;um&quot;, &quot;huh&quot;, &quot;ouch&quot;, &quot;erm&quot;, and &quot;wow&quot;. The first &quot;h&quot;-sound is a mimic for breathing out, and the second &quot;m&quot;-sound, since the mouth is closed, is representing that the person is not currently sure what to say (&quot;erm&quot; and &quot;um&quot; are used similarly). The pause filler indicates that the person is temporarily speechless, but still engaged in thought. The variety of tones, pitches, and lengths used add nuances in meaning.

===Etymology===
The expression is used in many different languages; however, the origin of &quot;hmm&quot; is difficult to find, mainly because &quot;the word is so natural that it may have arisen at any time&quot;, as highlighted by Anatoly Liberman, a linguist at the University of Minnesota and an expert on word origins. It is possible Neanderthals might have used &quot;hmm&quot;. Nicholas Christenfeld, a psychologist at the University of California, San Diego, and an expert on filled pauses, attests &quot;hmm&quot; is popular largely since it is such a neutral sound and that &quot;it&#x27;s easier to say than anything else&quot;. The earliest attestations of &quot;hmm&quot; are from Shakespeare, &quot;I cried hum ... But markt him not a word&quot; (1598 Shakespeare Henry IV, Pt. 1 iii. i. 154). It may be a vocable that grew out of lexicalized throat-clearing.

===Use as a filler word===
&quot;Hmm&quot; is a &quot;filler&quot; word, like &quot;um&quot; and &quot;er&quot;. Typically, &quot;hmm&quot; is uttered when the person is being especially conscious about whom they are talking with, and as a result are thinking deeply about what to say. Moreover, the use of &quot;hmm&quot; is often interactional and cognitive. The interactional function is to do with politeness: if someone is invited to a party and responds &quot;no&quot; without a filled pause, they might appear rude, but a reply of &quot;Hmm, sorry, no&quot; might appear much more polite, as it seems the speaker is giving the offer some thought, rather than abruptly declining.

===Thoughtful absorption===
The use of &quot;hmm&quot; is typically used during &quot;thoughtful absorption&quot;, which is when one is engrossed in their flow of ideas and associations, that lead to a reality-oriented conclusion. The utterance of &quot;hmm&quot; is key for listeners to understand that the speaker is currently engaged in thought; if the speaker thought silently instead, listeners may be unsure if the speaker had finished their utterance. &quot;Um&quot; and &quot;er&quot; are also used during thoughtful absorption; however, typically the extent of the absorption of thought is more limited since &quot;um&quot; and &quot;er&quot; are usually spoken mid-sentence and for shorter periods of time than &quot;hmm&quot;. For this reason, thoughtful absorption is typically associated with the utterance of &quot;hmm&quot;.

==&quot;Huh&quot; – the universal syllable==
A 2013 study suggested that the word/syllable &quot;huh&quot; is perhaps the most recognized syllable throughout the world. It is an interrogative which crosses geography, language, cultures and nationalities.

<text>Miguel Abia Biteo Boricó (11 January 1961 – 6 December 2012) was an Equatoguinean politician. He was the 5th Prime Minister of Equatorial Guinea having served from 11 July 2004 to 14 August 2006. He was a member of the Bubi ethnic group.

Abia Biteo lived and studied in the Soviet Union, where he became a mining engineer. After returning to Equatorial Guinea he began to work for the government and became one of the most powerful officials in his country&#x27;s oil industry. He was Minister of Finance from 1999 until 2000, when he was forced to resign following a corruption scandal. He was once a close ally of the President, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.

Abia Biteo served as Minister of State in charge of Relations with Parliament and Legal Affairs of the Presidency prior to being appointed Prime Minister on 11 July 2004; his government was announced on 14 July.

President Obiang directed serious criticism at Abia Biteo during 2006, and his government resigned on 10 August 2006. Ricardo Mangue Obama Nfubea was appointed to succeed him on 14 August. 

Abia Biteo remained tortured in Black Beach prison in Malabo as of 2007 and died on 6 December 2012 apparently due to a cardiac arrest.

<doc id="732992" wikidata="Q122841" url="?curid=732992" title="Adlai Stevenson III">
<text>Adlai Ewing Stevenson III (October 10, 1930 – September 6, 2021) was an American attorney and politician from Illinois. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a member of the United States Senate from 1970 to 1981. A member of the prominent Stevenson family, he also served as a member of the Illinois House of Representatives and Illinois Treasurer. He unsuccessfully ran for governor of Illinois in 1982 and 1986. He had been awarded Japan’s Order of the Sacred Treasure with gold and silver stars and was an honorary Professor of Renmin University of China.

==Early life, education, and early career (1930–1964)==
Adlai Stevenson III was born in Chicago to Ellen Stevenson and two time Democratic Party presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson II. He attended Milton Academy in Massachusetts, Harrow School in England, and Harvard College. He received a law degree in 1957 from Harvard Law School. Stevenson was commissioned as a lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1952, served in Korea and was discharged from active duty in 1954. He continued to serve in the Marine Reserve and was discharged in 1961 as a captain. In 1957, Stevenson went to work as a clerk for a Justice of the Supreme Court of Illinois and worked there until 1958 when he joined the law firm of Brown and Platt.

==Early political career (1964–1970)==

=== State politics ===

==== Illinois House of Representatives ====
Stevenson was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in the 1964 Illinois House of Representatives election, which was held at-large due to the state&#x27;s failure to redistrict. With 2,417,978 votes, he received the most votes of any candidate (by a margin of 7,613 more votes than the next candidate). More than half of ballots cast in the statewide general election included a vote for Stevenson.

Stevenson served in the Illinois House from 1965 to 1967. During his time in the state house, he won a Best Legislator award from the Independent Voters of Illinois.

==== Treasurer of Illinois ====
In 1966, Stevenson was elected treasurer of Illinois. As state treasurer, he quadrupled earnings on the investment of state funds while cutting the budget each year.

==United States Senate (1970–1981)==

=== Elections ===

==== 1970 ====
Following the death of incumbent U.S. Senator Everett Dirksen in 1969, Stevenson ran for his seat. He faced former state representative Ralph T. Smith in the general election, who was appointed to the seat by Gov. Richard B. Ogilvie. Stevenson defeated Smith in a 1970 special election by a vote of 2,065,054 (57%) to 1,519,718 (42%) to fill Dirksen&#x27;s unexpired term.

==== 1974 ====
In 1974, Stevenson ran for re-election, and faced Republican George Burditt in the general election. He defeated Burditt by a vote of 1,811,496 (62%) to 1,084,884 (37%).

=== Committee assignments ===
In the Senate, Stevenson served on the Commerce Committee (Chairman of the Subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space), Banking Committee (Chairman of the Subcommittee on International Finance) and Intelligence Committee (Chairman, Subcommittee on the Collection and Production of Intelligence). He was the first Chairman of the United States Senate Select Committee on Ethics charged with implementing a code of ethics he helped draft. Stevenson was also chairman of a Special Senate Committee which led the first major reorganization of the Senate since its Committee system was formed in the early 19th Century.

=== Tenure ===
Stevenson took his seat on November 17, 1970.

==== Vietnam War ====
Stevenson opposed the Vietnam War. He condemned Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Indochina policies and the violent police tactics at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, renewed his attacks on Republican President Richard Nixon’s prosecution of the war. He also introduced legislation requiring an end to all aid to South Vietnam by June 30, 1975.

==== Watergate scandal ====
Stevenson was highly critical of Republican President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal. He called on Nixon to answer for the integrity of the country’s leaders. “All of us — Republicans and Democrats — have an interest in clearing the record,&quot; he said a year before Nixon resigned in disgrace. “The faith of the people in their system and their leaders — a faith that has already been shaken enough — is at stake.&quot;

==== Legislative accomplishments ====
Stevenson authored the International Banking Act of 1978, the Stevenson–Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 and its companion, the Bayh–Dole Act, to foster cooperative research, organize national laboratories for technology utilization and commercialization, and permit private sector interests in government-funded research. He was the first chairman of the United States Senate Select Committee on Ethics charged with implementing a code of ethics he helped draft. Stevenson was also chairman of a special Senate committee that reorganized the Senate and served on the United States Senate Democratic Policy Committee. He also conducted the first in-depth congressional study of terrorism as chairman of the Subcommittee on the Collection and Production of Intelligence, leading to introduction of the Comprehensive Counter Terrorism Act of 1971. He warned of &quot;spectacular acts of disruption and destruction&quot; and an amendment that proposed reducing assistance for Israel by $200 million. His amendment received seven votes.

==== Views on Israel ====
Stevenson was a strong supporter of Israel, but was critical of the influence of American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) on US politics. Stevenson had sharp differences with the Israeli lobby on issues concerning the Middle East, including a 1979 vote to cut military assistance to Israel by 10 percent and support of a 1978 weapons sale to Saudi Arabia. AIPAC also criticized his meeting with PLO leader Yasser Arafat.

In a letter to Jewish leader Hyman Bookbinder in 1980, Stevenson wrote:&quot;It is the Israeli lobby, led by AIPAC, which I deplore. It does not speak for all Jewry, including Israeli Jewry. Yet it exercises an inordinate degree of influence with weak public officials. I deplore their subservience to the vagaries of a foreign government.&quot;

=== 1976 Presidential election ===

==== Presidential bid ====
Stevenson was encouraged to run for president in 1976, which was fueled by Richard J. Daley of Chicago, who resented the senator’s liberal reforms, but who recognized Stevenson as being a vote-getter. The senator declined to campaign, but as the nominating process got underway, Daley forces ran him as a favorite son candidate.

==== Vice presidential finalist ====
Despite this, former governor Jimmy Carter of Georgia locked up the nomination before the 1976 Democratic National Convention, in New York City. Stevenson was, however, one of the finalists for vice president at the convention, though Carter eventually chose U.S. Senator Walter Mondale from Minnesota.

=== Retirement ===
Stevenson opted to not run for reelection in 1980 and returned to Illinois to practice law.

==Post-Senate life and career (1981–2021)==

=== Gubernatorial bids ===
Stevenson ran for governor of Illinois in 1982 and 1986, losing both elections to James R. Thompson.

==== 1982 ====
In the 1982 campaign, Stevenson complained that Thompson was trying to portray him as an ineffectual elitist by famously stating, &quot;He is saying &#x27;Me tough guy,&#x27; as if to imply that I’m some kind of wimp.&quot; The initial vote count showed Stevenson winning; however, the final official count showed him losing by 0.14 percent. Stevenson promptly petitioned the Illinois Supreme Court for a recount and presented evidence of widespread election irregularities, including evidence of a failed punch card system for tabulation of votes. Three days before the gubernatorial inauguration, the court denied the recount in a 4-3 ruling, asserting that the Illinois recount statute was unconstitutional.

==== 1986 ====
In the 1986 statewide Democratic primaries, Democratic voters nominated allies of Lyndon LaRouche for lieutenant governor and secretary of state. Stevenson objected to their platform and refused to appear on the same ticket. Instead, he organized the Illinois Solidarity Party to provide an alternate slate for governor, lieutenant governor, and secretary of state, which was endorsed by Democratic Party of Illinois. Persuading Democrats to vote for most of the Democratic ticket as well as the Solidarity candidates for governor, lieutenant governor, and secretary of state was an unconventional strategy; however, Stevenson and the candidate for lieutenant governor position, Mike Howlett, won 40% of the vote.

===Later career ===

==== Business and cultural relations ====
After leaving the Senate, Stevenson was active in business and cultural relations with East Asia. He was chairman of SC&amp;M Investment Management Corporation, and co-chairman of HuaMei Capital Company (the first Chinese-American investment bank).

==== Non-profit organizations ====
He also held many positions with non-profit organizations in this area. He served as chairman of the National Association of Japan–America Societies Society of Chicago, the Midwest U.S.-Japan Association, and the Midwest U.S.-China Association, and as president of the U.S. Committee of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC). He was also co-chairman of the PECC&#x27;s Financial Market Development Project, a member of the U.S.-Korea Wisemen Council, and sat on the board of directors of the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy. He was also chairman of the international Adlai Stevenson Center on Democracy housed at the family home, a national historic landmark, near Libertyville, Illinois. Stevenson was also a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

==== UNPA proposal ====
On December 8, 2012, aged 82, Stevenson endorsed the proposal for the United Nations Parliamentary Assembly (UNPA), one of only six persons who served in the United States Congress ever to do so.

=== Death ===
Stevenson died from complications of Lewy body dementia at his home in Chicago on September 6, 2021, at age 90. 

== Personal life ==

=== Family ===

Stevenson&#x27;s great-grandfather Adlai E. Stevenson I was Vice President of the United States (1893–1897) during Grover Cleveland&#x27;s second term. His grandfather Lewis Stevenson was Illinois secretary of state (1914–1917). His father, Adlai Stevenson II, was governor of Illinois, Ambassador to the United Nations, and two-time Democratic presidential nominee. Actor McLean Stevenson was his third cousin.

=== Marriage and children ===
Stevenson met his future wife, Nancy Anderson, in 1953 while he was in tank training at Fort Knox in preparation for his deployment to Japan and then Korea. The couple was married in 1955 at Nancy’s home outside of Louisville. Together, they had four children. His son Adlai Stevenson IV is a business executive and former journalist. Though Adlai IV had previously expressed his intention to be &quot;Adlai the last,&quot; his son, Adlai Ewing Stevenson V, was born in the summer of 1994.

==Writings==

* Stevenson authored &quot;The Black Book,&quot; which records American history and culture from within its politics as his family knew it over five generations, starting with his great great grandfather, Jesse W. Fell, who was Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s patron and persuaded him to run for president. As well as his grandfather Lewis Stevenson, an Illinois secretary of state, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic vice-presidential nomination in 1928.

==Awards==
Stevenson has been honored with a number of awards, which include :

* Order of the Sacred Treasure, by the government of Japan, with gold and silver star.
* Honorary Professor of Renmin University in China.

<text>André-Gilles Fortin (; November 13, 1943 – June 24, 1977) was a Canadian politician. Fortin was a member of the House of Commons of Canada for Lotbinière. He was first elected in the 1968 federal election for the Ralliement Créditiste, which in 1971 merged with the Social Credit Party of Canada.

Fortin was elected leader of the party on November 7, 1976, after his popular predecessor, Réal Caouette, was forced to resign due to illness. The party was then struggling, having lost almost all its support in the west and in decline in Quebec where its members were divided between support for Canadian federalism and for sovereignty association for Quebec, a position supported by René Matte whom Fortin defeated for the leadership. Fortin&#x27;s efforts to rebuild the party were cut short when he was killed after only eight months as leader.

Fortin died in a car crash at about three in the morning on June 24, 1977, at the age of 33. It is believed that he fell asleep while driving and his car went off the highway, where it missed a bridge and jumped over a river, slamming into the embankment on the other side. The accident took place on the Trans-Canada Highway between Montreal and Quebec City. At the time of his death, he had two young children.

Réal Caouette&#x27;s son, Gilles Caouette, became acting leader of the party five days later.

<doc id="732998" wikidata="Q682363" url="?curid=732998" title="Project Pitchfork">
<text>Project Pitchfork are a German dark wave and electronic music group from Hamburg, Germany.

== History==
=== First years (1990–1994) ===
Project Pitchfork were formed by Peter Spilles and Dirk Scheuber. After agreeing to work together, they picked the project&#x27;s name by choosing a random word from the dictionary. The band gave their first performance in Hamburg in February 1990 and released their demo, &quot;K.N.K.A&quot;, in August. In May 1991, their debut album &quot;Dhyani&quot; was released. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Lam-&#x27;Bras&quot; was released in February 1992 and yielded the first vocal appearance of Patrica Nigiani. Six months later, the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Entities&quot; was released. The band switched labels to Off Beat for their 1994 release &quot;Io&quot;. The album featured two singles, &quot;Renascence&quot; and &quot;Carrion&quot;, and marked the first time the band entered the German Charts. The album was followed by a lengthy German tour.

=== The development years and success (1995–2002) ===
In 1995, Project Pitchfork established their own label, Candyland Entertainment, through which they would release the majority of their material as well as some side projects and bands such as Philtron and Deep Red. 1995 also saw the release of two EPs, &quot;CH&#x27;I&quot; and &quot;Corps d&#x27;Amour&quot;, and one album, &quot;Alpha Omega&quot;. The year finished off with a tour supported by Rammstein. The next Project Pitchfork studio album &quot;¡Chakra:Red!&quot; was released in 1997. It was the first album since &quot;Dhyani&quot; to be written as a group effort, rather than by Peter Spilles alone, and the first to include Jürgen Jansen as a permanent band member.

Immediately after their first US tour in 1998, Project Pitchfork returned with concept album &quot;&quot;, their first while signed to label EastWest, an imprint of the major label Warner Music. The album yielded three singles, &quot;Steelrose&quot;, &quot;Carnival&quot;, and &quot;I Live Your Dream&quot;. With the support of EastWest, the band had greater resources available to produce videos for their music, which led to their being the first gothic industrial band to receive airplay on music TV in Germany. The video for &quot;Steelrose&quot; earned the band a nomination for an Echo Award for Best Video National.

Between 1998 and 2001 the band built out their own studio which gave them more time to develop their next release. In 2001, the band released their eighth studio album &quot;Daimonion&quot; and supported the album with a European tour. In 2002 the band released the &quot;NUN&quot; trilogy which consisted of album &quot;Inferno&quot; and EPs &quot;View From a Throne&quot; and &quot;Trialog&quot;. This earned the band another nomination for an Echo Award, this time for Best Alternative Act National.

=== Recent years (2003–present) ===
Project Pitchfork returned with album Kaskade in 2005. In February 2009 the band released &quot;Dream, Tiresias!&quot; which received praise from electronic music magazine, ReGen. In 2010 the band&#x27;s follow up album &quot;Continuum Ride&quot; was released along with a video to support the song &quot;Beholder.&quot; &quot;Continuum Ride&quot; was inspired by the band&#x27;s US tour in 2009, particularly their experience of Detroit, whose dilapidated skyline led to a more &quot;dark and destructive&quot; sound than that of their previous album. By 2011 Project Pitchfork ceased operating their Candyland label, having since begun releasing their work on the Trisol label.

The band released &quot;Quantum Mechanics&quot; in 2011 as well as a video for the album&#x27;s second track, &quot;Lament&quot;. Later that year the band released a compilation album titled &quot;First Anthology&quot;. In 2013 the band released their fourteenth studio album, &quot;Black&quot;, and a music video to accompany the song &quot;Rain&quot;. In June 2014, the band announced via their official website a new album titled &quot;Blood&quot;. To promote the record the band held a pre-release show in Hamburg. The album was released in September and featured a music video for &quot;Blood-Diamond (See Him Running)&quot; edited by Peter Spilles himself.

In 2016, Project Pitchfork released their &quot;Second Anthology&quot;, a double CD that included one new track, several unreleased rarities, and many re-recorded and remastered tracks. Also in 2016, the band released the album &quot;Look Up, I’m Down There&quot; to commemorate their 25th anniversary. The album was released in two versions: a standard CD release and a special, limited edition double CD with an 80-page art book containing complete lyrics and a short story by the fantasy author Björn Springorum.

In 2018, the band released the album &quot;Akkretion&quot;, the first of what was planned to be a trilogy of albums for release that year. On 12 October 2018, the second part of the trilogy, &quot;Fragment&quot;, was released.

Starting in 2019, Trisol began releasing reissues of all the band&#x27;s material over the previous decade from &quot;Dream, Tiresias!&quot; through &quot;Look Up, I&#x27;m Down There&quot;.

On 2 March 2021 the band announced that cofounder and keyboardist Dirk Scheuber had left the band.

In 2024 the band release “Elysium” the third and final act of cosmic electro trilogy that started with “Akkretion”. To support the album release the band will commence a German tour in April 2024 with one date in the UK during May and will play various festivals.

<text>Adab (Sumerian: &quot;Adab&quot;ki, spelled UD.NUNKI) was an ancient Sumerian city between Girsu and Nippur, lying about 35 kilometers southeast of the latter. It was located at the site of modern Bismaya or Bismya in the Al-Qādisiyyah Governorate of Iraq. The site was occupied at least as early as the 3rd Millenium BC, through the Early Dynastic, Akkadian Empire, and Ur III empire periods, into the Kassite period in the mid-2nd millennium BC. It is known that there were temples of Ninhursag/Digirmah, Iskur, Asgi, Inanna and Enki at Adab and that the city-god of Adab was Parag&#x27;ellilegarra (Panigingarra) &quot;The Sovereign Appointed by Ellil&quot;.

Not to be confused with the small, later (Old Babylonian and Sassanian periods) archaeological site named Tell Bismaya, 9 kilometers east of the confluence of the Diyala and the Tigris rivers, excavated by Iraqi archaeologists in the 1980s or Tell Basmaya, southeast of modern Baghdad, excavated by Iraqi archaeologists in 2013-2014.

==Archaeology==

The 400-hectare site consists of a number of mounds distributed over an area about long and wide, consisting of a number of low ridges, nowhere exceeding in height, lying somewhat nearer to the Tigris than the Euphrates, about a day&#x27;s journey to the southeast of Nippur. It was surrounded by a double wall. In total there are twelve mounds of which two (Mounds X and XII) are the result of sand dredged from the Iturungal canal, though some rooms and 20 tablets were found on the northern extension of X. Persons reported working on mound XIV and mound XVI but there is no record where they lay. Some private houses were noted outside the east wall. Notable mounds were
*Mound I - Palace, Isin/Larsa - Old Babylonian Periods. About 33 meters by 25 meters. Several hundred mostly fragmentary tablets
*Mound II - Cemetery and House by Bath. Seven burials (5 intramural graves, 2 tombs).
*Mound III - Administrative and light industrial near west corner. Early Dynastic, Akkadian, and Ur III levels. Most tablets found there date to reign of Akkadian Empire ruler Shar-kali-sharri.
*Mound IV - The Library. Over 2,000 tablets found here, originally held in reed baskets with labels. Akkadian period administrative center.
*Mound V - E-Sar/E-mah Temple. Mound 11 meters high and 90 meters in circumference. Ten occupation levels, atop pure sand, ranging from Early Dynastic I to Ur III. Inscribed bricks of Kurigalzu indicated restoration in the Kassite period. Two consecutive temples were built with the first ritually sealed before construction of the second.
*Mound VI - Large walls with inscribed bricks of Amar-Sin. Thought to be a temple.

Initial examinations of the site of Bismaya were by William Hayes Ward of the Wolfe Expedition in 1885 and by John Punnett Peters of the University of Pennsylvania in 1890, each spending a day there and finding one cuneiform tablet and a few fragments. Walter Andrae visited Bismaya in 1902, found a tablet fragment and produced a sketch map of the site.
Excavations were conducted there on behalf of the University of Chicago and led by Edgar James Banks for a total of six months beginning on Christmas Day of 1903 until May 25, 1904. Work resumed on September 19, 1904 but was stopped after 8 1/2 days by the Ottoman authorities. Excavation resumed on March 13, 1905 under the direction of Victor S. Persons and continued until the end of June, 1905. During the excavation of a city gate thousands of sling balls (some stone, most of baked clay), some flattened, were found which the excavator interpreted as the result of a battle. While Banks was better trained than the earlier generation of antiquarians and treasure hunters and used more modern archaeological methods the excavations suffered seriously from having never been properly published. The Banks expedition to Bismaya was well documented by the standards of the time and many objects photographed though no final report was ever produced due to personal disputes. In 2012, the Oriental Institute re-examined the records and objects returned to the institute by Banks and produced a &quot;re-excavation&quot; report. One issue is that Banks and Persons purchase objects from Adab locally while there and it is uncertain which object held at the museum were excavated vs being bought.
On Mound V, on what was originally thought to be an island but has since been understood to have resulted from a shift in the canal bed, stood the temple, E-mah, with a ziggurat. The temple had two occupational phases. E-Sar, the first (Earlier Temple), constructed of plano-convex bricks, was from the Early Dynastic period. That temple was later filled in with mud bricks and sealed off with a course of baked brick and bitumen pavement. A foundation deposit of Adab ruler E-iginimpa&#x27;e dated to Early Dynastic IIIa was found on that pavement containing &quot;inscribed adze-shaped copper object (A543) with a copper spike (A542) inserted into the hole at its end and two tablets, one of copper alloy (A1160) and one of white stone (A1159)&quot;.
The second temple (Later Temple) was faced by baked bricks, some with an inscription of the Ur III ruler Shulgi naming it the temple of the goddess Ninhursag.

Adab was evidently once a city of considerable importance, but deserted at a very early period, since the ruins found close to the surface of the mounds belong to Shulgi and Ur-Nammu, kings of the Third Dynasty of Ur in the latter part of the third millennium BC, based on inscribed bricks excavated at Bismaya. Immediately below these, as at Nippur, were found artifacts dating to the reign of Naram-Sin and Sargon or the Akkadian Empire, c. 2300 BC. Below these there were still of stratified remains, constituting seven-eighths of the total depth of the ruins. A large palace was found in the central area with a very large well lined with plan-convex bricks, marking it as being from the Early Dynastic period. 
Besides the remains of buildings, walls, and graves, Banks discovered a large number of inscribed clay tablets of a very early period, bronze and stone tablets, bronze implements and the like. Of the tablets, 543 went to the Oriental Institute and roughly 1100, mostly purchased from the locals rather than excavated, went to the Istanbul Museum. The latter are still unpublished and are unavailble for study. Brick stamps, found by Banks during his excavation of Adab state that the Akkadian ruler Naram-Sin built a temple to Inanna at Adab, but the temple was not found during the dig, and is not known for certain to be &quot;E-shar&quot;. The two most notable discoveries were a complete statue in white marble, apparently the earliest yet found in Mesopotamia, now in the Istanbul Archaeology Museums, bearing the inscription, translated by Banks as &quot;E-mach, King Da-udu, King of, Ud-Nun&quot;, now known as the statue of Lugal-dalu and a temple refuse heap, consisting of great quantities of fragments of vases in marble, alabaster, onyx, porphyry and granite, some of which were inscribed, and others engraved and inlaid with ivory and precious stones.

Of the Adab tablets that ended up at the University of Chicago, sponsor of the excavations, all have been published and also made available in digital form online.
 After the end of excavation, on a later personal trip the region in 1913, Banks purchased thousands of tablets from a number of sites, many from Adab, and sold them sold piecemeal to various owners over years. Some have made their way into publication. Many more have subsequently made their way into the antiquities market from illegal looting of the site and some have also been published. A number ended up in the collection of the Cornell University.
In response to widespread looting which began after the war 1991, the Iraq State Board of Antiquities and Heritage conducted an excavation at Adab in 2001. The site has now been largely destroyed by systematic looting which increased after the war in 2003, so further excavation is unlikely. On the order of a thousand tablets from that looting, all from the Sargonic Period, have been sold to various collectors and many are being published, though missing archaeological context. Of the 9,000 published tablets from the Sargonic Period (Early Dynastic IIIb, Early Sargonic, Middle Sargonic and Classic Sargonic) about 2,300 came from Adab.

From 2016 to 2019, the University of Bologna and the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities and Heritage led by Nicolò Marchetti conducted a program, the Qadis survey, of coordinated remote sensing and surface surveys in the Qadisiyah province including at Bismaya (QD049). Results included a &quot;Preliminary reconstruction of the urban layout and hydraulic landscape around Bismaya/Adab in the ED III and Akkadian periods&quot;. A previously unknown palace was discovered and the extent of looting identified. It was determined that the city was surrounded by canals. The overall occupation of the site in the Early Dynastic III period was determined to have been 462 hectares. The Qadis survey showed that Adab had a 24-hectare central harbor, with a maximum length of 240 meters and a maximum width of 215 meters. The harbor was connected to the Tigris river via a 100-meter–wide canal. In 2001 a statue became available to the Baghdad Museum which was inscribed &quot;Temple Builder, of the goddess Nin-SU(?)-KID(?): Epa&#x27;e, King of Adab&quot;.

==History==
Adab is mentioned in late 4th millennium BC texts found at Uruk but no finds from that period have been recovered from the site.

===Early Dynastic Period===

Adab was occupied from at least the Early Dynastic Period. According to Sumerian text &quot;Inanna&#x27;s descent to the netherworld&quot;, there was a temple of Inanna named &quot;E-shar&quot; at Adab during the reign of Dumuzid of Uruk. In another text in the same series, &quot;Dumuzid&#x27;s dream&quot;, Dumuzid of Uruk is toppled from his opulence by a hungry mob composed of men from the major cities of Sumer, including Adab.

A king of Kish, Mesilim, appears to have ruled at Adab, based on inscriptions found at Bismaya. One inscription, on a bowl fragment reads &quot;Mesilim, king of Kish, to Esar has returned[this bowl], Salkisalsi being patesi of Adab&quot;. One king of Adab, Lugal-Anne-Mundu, appearing in the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot;, is mentioned in few contemporary inscriptions; some that are much later copies claim that he established a vast, but brief empire stretching from Elam all the way to Lebanon and the Amorite territories along the Jordan. Adab is also mentioned in some of the Ebla tablets from roughly the same era as a trading partner of Ebla in northern Syria, shortly before Ebla was destroyed by unknown forces.

A marble statue was found at Bismaya inscribed with the name of another king of Adab, variously translated as Lugal-daudu, Da-udu, and Lugaldalu. An inscription of Eannatum, ruler of Lagash was also found at Adab.

===Sargonic period===

Meskigal, governor of Adab under Lugalzagesi of Uruk, changed allegiance to Akkad and became governor under Sargon of Akkad. He later joined other cities including Zabalam in a rebellion against Rimush son of Sargon and second ruler of the Akkadian Empire and was defeated and captured. About 380 of the published tablets from Adab date to the time of Meskigal (ED IIIB/Early Sargonic). This rebellion occurred during the first two regnal years of Rimush. A year name of Rimush reads &quot;The year Adab was destroyed&quot; and an inscription reads &quot;Rimus, king of the world, was victorious over Adab and Zabala in battle and struck down 15,718 men. He took 14,576 captives&quot;. Various governors, including Lugal-gis, Sarru-alli, Ur-Tur, and Lugal-ajagu then ruled Adab under direct Akkadian control. About 1000 tablets from this period (Middle Sargonic) have been published. In the time of Sargon&#x27;s grandson Naram-Sin Adab, again joined a &quot;Great Rebellion&quot; against Akkad and was again defeated. In the succeeding period (Classical Sargonic) it is known that there were temples to Ninhursag/Digirmah (E-Mah), Iskur, Asgi, Inanna and Enki. By the end of the Akkadian period, Adab was occupied by the Gutians, who made it their capital. Enheduanna, daughter of Sargon and first known poet, wrote a number of temple hymns including one to the temple of the goddess Ninhursag and her son Ashgi at Adab.

===Ur III Empire===

Several governors of the city under Ur III are also known including Ur-Asgi and Habaluge under Ur III ruler Shulgi (and Amar-Sin) and Ur-Asgi II under Shu-Sin. A brick inscription found at Adab marked Shulgi dedicating a weir to the goddess Ninhursag. Inscribed bricks of Amar-Sin were also found at Adab. A temple for the deified Shi-Sin was built at Adab by Habaluge.
===2nd Millennium BC===
About 200 inscribed objects, mainly tablets but also a few bricks and clay sealings, from the Old Babylonian period of the early 2nd millenium BC from Adab are known. The city of Adab is also mentioned in the Code of Hammurabi (c. 1792 – c. 1750 BC). There is a Sumerian language comic tale, dating to the Old Babylonian period, of the &quot;Three Ox-drivers from Adab&quot;.
Inscribed bricks of the Kassite dynasty ruler Kurigalzu I (c. 1375 BC) were found at Adab, marking the last verified occupation of the site.

<text>The &quot;Three Colours&quot; trilogy (, ) is the collective title of three psychological drama films directed by Krzysztof Kieślowski: &quot;Three Colours: Blue&quot; (1993), &quot;Three Colours: White&quot; (1994), and &quot;Three Colours: Red&quot; (1994), represented by the Flag of France. The trilogy is an international co-production between France, Poland, and Switzerland in the French language, with the exception of &quot;White&quot; in Polish and French. 

All three installments were co-written by Kieślowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz (with story consultants Agnieszka Holland and Sławomir Idziak), produced by Marin Karmitz and composed by Zbigniew Preisner. All three films garnered widespread acclaim from reviews, with &quot;Red&quot; receiving nominations for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography at the 67th Academy Awards.

==Themes==
Blue, white, and red are the colours of the French flag in hoist-to-fly order, and the story of each film is loosely based on one of the three political ideals in the motto of the French Republic: liberty, equality, fraternity. As with the treatment of the Ten Commandments in &quot;Dekalog&quot;, the illustration of these principles is often ambiguous and ironic. As Kieślowski noted in an interview with an Oxford University student newspaper: &quot;The words [&quot;liberté, egalité, fraternité&quot;] are French because the money [to fund the films] is French. If the money had been of a different nationality, we would have titled the films differently, or they might have had a different cultural connotation. But the films would probably have been the same&quot;.

The trilogy has also been interpreted by film critic Roger Ebert as, respectively, an anti-tragedy, an anti-comedy, and an anti-romance.

==Connections and patterns==
A symbol common to the three films is that of an underlying link or thing that keeps the protagonist linked to their past. In the case of &quot;Blue&quot;, it is the lamp of blue beads, and a symbol seen throughout the film in the TV of people falling (doing either sky diving or bungee jumping); the director is careful to show falls with no cords at the beginning of the film, but as the story develops the image of cords becomes more and more apparent as a symbol of a link to the past. In the case of &quot;White&quot; the item that links Karol to his past is a 2 Fr. coin and a plaster bust of Marianne that he steals from an antique store in Paris. In the case of &quot;Red&quot;, the judge never closes or locks his doors and his fountain pen, which stops working at a crucial point in the story.

Another recurring image related to the spirit of the film is that of elderly people recycling bottles: In &quot;Blue&quot;, an old woman in Paris is recycling bottles and Julie does not notice her (in the spirit of freedom); in &quot;White&quot;, an old man also in Paris is trying to recycle a bottle but cannot reach the container and Karol looks at him with a sinister grin on his face (in the spirit of equality); and in &quot;Red&quot;, an old woman cannot reach the hole of the container and Valentine helps her (in the spirit of fraternity).

In &quot;Blue&quot;, while Julie is searching for her husband&#x27;s mistress in the central courthouse, she accidentally steps into an active court trial and is immediately turned around by security. While Julie is peeking into the courtroom, Karol from &quot;White&quot; can be heard pleading to the judge in a scene that begins his chapter of the trilogy.

Each film&#x27;s ending shot is of a character crying. In &quot;Blue&quot;, Julie de Courcy cries looking into space. In &quot;White&quot;, Karol cries as he looks at his wife. In &quot;Red&quot;, the judge Kern cries as he looks through his broken window out at the camera.

Many main characters from &quot;Blue&quot; and &quot;White&quot;, including Julie and Karol, appear at the ending of &quot;Red&quot; as survivors of a ferry accident.

==Soundtrack==
Music for all three parts of the trilogy was composed by Zbigniew Preisner and performed by Silesian Philharmonic choir along with Sinfonia Varsovia.

==Reception==
The trilogy as a whole topped &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot;″s list of the best films of 1994, ranked third on &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; writer Glenn Lovell&#x27;s year-end list, ten on a list by Michael Mills of &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot;, and was also on unranked top-tens list by &quot;Tulsa World&quot;″s Dennis King and &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; critics Eleanor Ringel and Steve Murray. Roger Ebert ranked the trilogy as a whole at No. 5 on his list of the &quot;Best films of 1990s&quot;. He also included the trilogy in its entirety to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list.

Ranked #11 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 33 Greatest Movie Trilogies&quot; in 2010.

Ranked #14 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; in 2010.

<text>Neil Geoffrey Turok (born 16 November 1958) is a South African physicist. He has held the Higgs Chair of Theoretical Physics at the University of Edinburgh since 2020, and has been director emeritus of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics since 2019. He specializes in mathematical physics and early-universe physics, including the cosmological constant and a cyclic model for the universe.

==Early life and career==
Turok was born on 16 November 1958 in Johannesburg, South Africa, to Mary Turok and Byelorussian-born Ben Turok, who were activists in the anti-apartheid movement and the African National Congress. 

After graduating from Churchill College, Cambridge, Turok gained his doctorate from Imperial College, London, under the supervision of David Olive, one of the inventors of superstring theory. After a postdoctoral post at Santa Barbara, he was an associate scientist at Fermilab, Illinois. 

In 1992 he was awarded the Maxwell medal of the Institute of Physics for his contributions to theoretical physics. In 1994 he was appointed Professor of Physics at Princeton University, then held the Chair of Mathematical Physics at the University of Cambridge starting in 1997. He was appointed Director of the Perimeter Institute in 2008. In 2020, Turok was appointed as the Inaugural Higgs Chair of Theoretical Physics at the University of Edinburgh.

==Research and other contributions==
Turok has worked in a number of areas of mathematical physics and early universe physics, focusing on observational tests of fundamental physics in cosmology. In the early 1990s, his group showed how the polarisation and temperature anisotropies of the Cosmic microwave background would be correlated, a prediction which has been confirmed in detail by recent precision measurements by the WMAP spacecraft. They also developed a key test for the presence of a cosmological constant, also recently confirmed.
Turok and collaborators developed the theory of open inflation. With Stephen Hawking, he later developed the so-called Hawking-Turok instanton solutions which, according to the no-boundary proposal of Hawking and James Hartle, can describe the birth of an inflationary universe.

Together with Justin Khoury, Burt Ovrut and Paul Steinhardt, Turok introduced the notion of 
the Ekpyrotic Universe, &quot;... a cosmological model in which the hot big bang universe is produced by the collision of a brane in the bulk space with a bounding orbifold plane, beginning from an otherwise cold, vacuous, static universe&quot;. 
Most recently, with Paul Steinhardt at Princeton, Turok has been developing a cyclic model for the universe, in which the big bang is explained as a collision between two &quot;brane-worlds&quot; in M theory. The predictions of this model are in agreement with current cosmological data, but there are interesting differences with the predictions of cosmological inflation which will be probed by future experiments (probably by the Planck space observatory). In 2006, Steinhardt and Turok showed how the cyclic model could naturally incorporate a mechanism for relaxing the cosmological constant to very small values, consistent with current observations. In 2007, Steinhardt and Turok co-authored the popular science book &quot;Endless Universe&quot;. In 2012, Turok&#x27;s Massey Lectures were published as &quot;The Universe Within: from Quantum to Cosmos&quot;.

In 2003, Turok founded the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Muizenberg, a postgraduate educational centre supporting the development of mathematics and science across the African continent.

==Awards and honours==
He was awarded the 2008 TED Prize for his work in mathematical physics and in establishing the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Muizenberg. He also received a &quot;Most Innovative People Award,&quot; for Social Innovation, at the World Summit on Innovation and Entrepreneurship (WSIE) in 2008.

On 9 May 2008, Mike Lazaridis announced that Turok would become the new Executive Director of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics starting on 1 October 2008.

<text>The Martyrs&#x27; Memorial is a stone monument positioned at the intersection of St Giles&#x27;, Magdalen Street and Beaumont Street, to the west of Balliol College, Oxford, England. It commemorates the 16th-century Oxford Martyrs.

==History==
The monument was built 300 years after the events of the English Reformation and commemorates the Bishop of Worcester, Hugh Latimer, and Bishop of London, Nicholas Ridley, who were burned nearby on 16 October 1555 after having been convicted for heresy because of their Protestant beliefs after a quick trial. It also commemorates the former archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer, who was similarly executed (after having watched his colleagues&#x27; painful deaths while imprisoned in a nearby tower and the Vatican having permitted his degradation from holy orders in February) on 21 March 1556. The Rev. Charles Pourtales Golightly (a descendant of Huguenots who fled to England in that earlier era) and other Anglican clergy raised the funds to erect the monument during the Victorian era. They opposed the 19th-century Oxford Movement (also known as the Tractarian Movement), led by John Keble, John Henry Newman and others. Golightly and his colleagues were alarmed at the Anglo-Catholic realignment the movement was bringing into the Church of England, and wanted the memorial to reflect the university&#x27;s Protestant profession and anti-Catholic tradition.

==Description==
Designed by George Gilbert Scott, the monument was completed in 1843 after two years&#x27; work, having replaced &quot;a picturesque but tottering old house&quot;. The Victorian Gothic memorial, whose design dates from 1838, has been likened to the steeple of a cathedral, though it was consciously patterned on the Eleanor crosses erected by King Edward I between 1290 and 1294 to the memory of his wife, Queen Eleanor of Castile (1241–1290). Henry Weekes sculpted the three statues of Cranmer, Latimer and Ridley. The statues are carved from Caen stone while the monument itself is made of Magnesian limestone. The monument is listed at Grade II*.

The inscription on the base of the Martyrs&#x27; Memorial reads:

To the Glory of God, and in grateful commemoration of His servants, Thomas Cranmer, Nicholas Ridley, Hugh Latimer, Prelates of the Church of England, who near this spot yielded their bodies to be burned, bearing witness to the sacred truths which they had affirmed and maintained against the errors of the Church of Rome, and rejoicing that to them it was given not only to believe in Christ, but also to suffer for His sake; this monument was erected by public subscription in the year of our Lord God, MDCCCXLI [1841].

Cuthbert Bede (in his novel &quot;The Adventures of Mr Verdant Green&quot;) wrote about the setting of the Martyrs&#x27; Memorial thus in 1853:
He who enters the city, as Mr Green did, from the Woodstock Road, and rolls down the shady avenue of St Giles&#x27;, between St John&#x27;s College and the Taylor Buildings, and past the graceful Martyrs&#x27; Memorial, will receive impressions such as probably no other city in the world could convey.

The actual execution site is close by in Broad Street, just outside the line of the old city walls. The site is marked by an iron cross sunk in the road.

==Current condition==

The Memorial deteriorated during the 20th century, but underwent a full restoration in 2002, as part of the 75th anniversary of the Oxford Preservation Trust. The Oxford Preservation Trust opened a public fundraising campaign in April 2001, and subsequently cleaned the memorial, repainted the heraldic shields, and reshaped and replaced the incomplete and missing statues. The restored monument was unveiled in January 2003.

Popular rumour is that in the past students have misled foreign tourists about the nature of the Memorial and convinced them it was the spire of an underground church, which could be toured for a modest fee. This would result in the tourists venturing down a nearby flight of stairs which actually led to the public toilets.

<doc id="733009" wikidata="Q8973627" url="?curid=733009" title="Nanopore sequencing">
<text>Nanopore sequencing is a third generation approach used in the sequencing of biopolymers — specifically, polynucleotides in the form of DNA or RNA.

Nanopore sequencing allows a single molecule of DNA or RNA be sequenced without PCR amplification or chemical labeling. Nanopore sequencing has the potential to offer relatively low-cost genotyping, high mobility for testing, and rapid processing of samples, including the ability to display real-time results. It has been proposed for rapid identification of viral pathogens, monitoring ebola, environmental monitoring, food safety monitoring, human genome sequencing, plant genome sequencing, monitoring of antibiotic resistance, haplotyping and other applications.

== Development ==
Nanopore sequencing took 25 years to materialize. David Deamer was one of the first to push the idea. In 1989 he sketched out a plan to push single-strands of DNA through a protein nanopore embedded into a thin membrane as part his work to synthesize RNA. Realizing that the approach might allow DNA sequencing, Deamer and his team spent a decade refining the concept. In 1999 they published the first paper using the term &#x27;nanopore sequencing&#x27; and two years later produced an image capturing a DNA hairpin passing through a nanopore in real time. 

Another foundation for nanopore sequencing was the work of Hagan Bayley&#x27;s team, who from the 1990s independently developed stochastic sensing, a technique that measures the change in an ionic current passing through a nanopore to determine the concentration and identity of a substance. By 2005 Bayley had made progress with the DNA sequencing method. He co-founded Oxford Nanopore to push the technology. In 2014 the company released its first portable nanopore sequencing device. This made it possible for DNA sequencing to be carried out almost anywhere, even with limited resources. A quarter of the world&#x27;s SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes were sequenced with nanopore devices. The technology offers an important tool for combating antimicrobial resistance. In 2020, China-based Qitan Technology launched its nanopore single-molecule gene sequencer, while in 2024 MGI Tech launched its own products.

==Principles ==
The biological or solid-state membrane, where the nanopore is found, is surrounded by an electrolyte solution. The membrane splits the solution into two chambers. Applying a bias voltage across the membrane induces an electric field that drives charged particles, in this case the ions, into motion. This effect is known as electrophoresis. For a high enough concentrations, the electrolyte solution is well distributed and the voltage drop concentrates near and inside the nanopore. This means charged particles in the solution feel a force only from the electric field when they are near the pore region. This region is typically referred to as the capture region. Inside the capture region, ions have a directed motion that can be recorded as a steady ionic current by placing electrodes near the membrane. A nano-sized polymer such as DNA or protein placed in one of the chambers has a net charge that feels a force from the electric field in the capture region. The molecule approaches this capture region aided by Brownian motion. Any attraction it might have to the surface of the membrane. Once inside the nanopore, the molecule translocates via a combination of electro-phoretic, electro-osmotic and sometimes thermo-phoretic forces. Inside the pore the molecule occupies a volume that partially restricts the ion flow, observed as an ionic current drop. Based on various factors such as geometry, size and chemical composition, the change in magnitude of the ionic current and the duration of the translocation vary. Different molecules can then be sensed and potentially identified based on this current modulation.

=== Base identification ===
The magnitude of the electric current density across a nanopore surface depends on the nanopore&#x27;s dimensions and the composition of DNA or RNA that is occupying the nanopore. Sequencing was made possible because passing through the channel of the nanopore, the samples cause characteristic changes in the density of the electric current. The total charge flowing through a nanopore channel is equal to the surface integral of electric current density flux across the nanopore unit normal surfaces.

==Types==
=== Biological ===
Biological nanopore sequencing relies on the use of transmembrane proteins, called protein nanopores, in particular, formed by protein toxins, that are embedded in lipid membranes so as to create size dependent porous surfaces - with nanometer scale &quot;holes&quot; distributed across the membranes. Sufficiently low translocation velocity can be attained through the incorporation of various proteins that facilitate the movement of DNA or RNA through the pores of the lipid membranes.

====Alpha hemolysin====
Alpha hemolysin (αHL), a nanopore from bacteria that causes lysis of red blood cells, has been studied for over 15 years. To this point, studies have shown that all four bases can be identified using ionic current measured across the αHL pore. The structure of αHL is advantageous to identify specific bases moving through the pore. The αHL pore is ~10 nm long, with two distinct 5 nm sections. The upper section consists of a larger, vestibule-like structure and the lower section consists of three possible recognition sites (R1, R2, R3), and is able to discriminate between each base.

Sequencing using αHL has been developed through basic study and structural mutations, moving towards the sequencing of very long reads. Protein mutation of αHL has improved the detection abilities of the pore. The next proposed step is to bind an exonuclease onto the αHL pore. The enzyme would periodically cleave single bases, enabling the pore to identify successive bases. Coupling an exonuclease to the biological pore would slow the translocation of the DNA through the pore, and increase the accuracy of data acquisition.

Notably, theorists have shown that sequencing via exonuclease enzymes as described here is not feasible. This is mainly due to diffusion related effects imposing a limit on the capture probability of each nucleotide as it is cleaved. This results in a significant probability that a nucleotide is either not captured before it diffuses into the bulk or captured out of order, and therefore is not properly sequenced by the nanopore, leading to insertion and deletion errors. Therefore, major changes are needed to this method before it can be considered a viable strategy.

A recent study has pointed to the ability of αHL to detect nucleotides at two separate sites in the lower half of the pore. The R1 and R2 sites enable each base to be monitored twice as it moves through the pore, creating 16 different measurable ionic current values instead of 4. This method improves upon the single read through the nanopore by doubling the sites that the sequence is read per nanopore.

====MspA====
Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) is the second biological nanopore currently being investigated for DNA sequencing. The MspA pore has been identified as a potential improvement over αHL due to a more favorable structure. The pore is described as a goblet with a thick rim and a diameter of 1.2 nm at the bottom of the pore. A natural MspA, while favorable for DNA sequencing because of shape and diameter, has a negative core that prohibited single stranded DNA(ssDNA) translocation. The natural nanopore was modified to improve translocation by replacing three negatively charged aspartic acids with neutral asparagines.

The electric current detection of nucleotides across the membrane has been shown to be tenfold more specific than αHL for identifying bases. Utilizing this improved specificity, a group at the University of Washington has proposed using double stranded DNA (dsDNA) between each single stranded molecule to hold the base in the reading section of the pore. The dsDNA would halt the base in the correct section of the pore and enable identification of the nucleotide. A recent grant has been awarded to a collaboration from UC Santa Cruz, the University of Washington, and Northeastern University to improve the base recognition of MspA using phi29 polymerase in conjunction with the pore. MspA with electric current detection can also be used to sequence peptides.

=== Solid state ===
Solid state nanopore sequencing approaches, unlike biological nanopore sequencing, do not incorporate proteins into their systems. Instead, solid state nanopore technology uses various metal or metal alloy substrates with nanometer sized pores that allow DNA or RNA to pass through. These substrates most often serve integral roles in the sequence recognition of nucleic acids as they translocate through the channels along the substrates.

====Tunneling current====

Measurement of electron tunneling through bases as ssDNA translocates through the nanopore is an improved solid state nanopore sequencing method. Most research has focused on proving bases could be determined using electron tunneling. These studies were conducted using a scanning probe microscope as the sensing electrode, and have proved that bases can be identified by specific tunneling currents. After the proof of principle research, a functional system must be created to couple the solid state pore and sensing devices. 
Researchers at the Harvard Nanopore group have engineered solid state pores with single walled carbon nanotubes across the diameter of the pore. Arrays of pores are created and chemical vapor deposition is used to create nanotubes that grow across the array. Once a nanotube has grown across a pore, the diameter of the pore is adjusted to the desired size. Successful creation of a nanotube coupled with a pore is an important step towards identifying bases as the ssDNA translocates through the solid state pore.

Another method is the use of nanoelectrodes on either side of a pore. The electrodes are specifically created to enable a solid state nanopore&#x27;s formation between the two electrodes. This technology could be used to not only sense the bases but to help control base translocation speed and orientation.

====Fluorescence====
An effective technique to determine a DNA sequence has been developed using solid state nanopores and fluorescence. This fluorescence sequencing method converts each base into a characteristic representation of multiple nucleotides which bind to a fluorescent probe strand-forming dsDNA. With the two color system proposed, each base is identified by two separate fluorescences, and will therefore be converted into two specific sequences. Probes consist of a fluorophore and quencher at the start and end of each sequence, respectively. Each fluorophore will be extinguished by the quencher at the end of the preceding sequence. When the dsDNA is translocating through a solid state nanopore, the probe strand will be stripped off, and the upstream fluorophore will fluoresce.

This sequencing method has a capacity of 50-250 bases per second per pore, and a four color fluorophore system (each base could be converted to one sequence instead of two), will sequence over 500 bases per second. Advantages of this method are based on the clear sequencing readout—using a camera instead of noisy current methods. However, the method does require sample preparation to convert each base into an expanded binary code before sequencing. Instead of one base being identified as it translocates through the pore, ~12 bases are required to find the sequence of one base.

== Purposes ==
Nanopore devices can be used for eDNA analysis in environmental monitoring and crop epidemiology. These can be miniaturised more than earlier technologies and so have been made into portable devices, especially the MinION. The MinION is especially known for the studies of crop viruses by Boykin et al 2018 &amp; Shaffer 2019 and studies of species prevalence by Menegon et al 2017 and Pomerantz et al 2018. Owing to its high portability, low cost and easiness to use for rapid sequencing applications, it also raised ethical, legal and social concerns along with other next generation sequencing technologies. SARS-CoV-2 variants in Prague wastewater were detected by nanopore-based sequencing. Sequencing of sub-sewershed samples benefits epidemiological early warning systems.

=== Biological: advantages and disadvantages ===
Biological nanopore sequencing systems have several fundamental characteristics that make them advantageous as compared with solid state systems- with each advantageous characteristic of this design approach stemming from the incorporation of proteins into their technology. Uniform pore structure, the precise control of sample translocation through pore channels, and even the detection of individual nucleotides in samples can be facilitated by unique proteins from a variety of organism types.

The use of proteins in biological nanopore sequencing systems, despite the various benefits, also brings with it some negative characteristics. The sensitivity of the proteins in these systems to local environmental stress has a large impact on the longevity of the units, overall. One example is that a motor protein may only unzip samples with sufficient speed at a certain pH range while not operating fast enough outside of the range- this constraint impacts the functionality of the whole sequencing unit. Another example is that a transmembrane porin may only operate reliably for a certain number of runs before it breaks down. Both of these examples would have to be controlled for in the design of any viable biological nanopore system- something that may be difficult to achieve while keeping the costs of such a technology as low and as competitive, to other systems, as possible.

==Challenges==
One challenge for the &#x27;strand sequencing&#x27; method was in refining the method to improve its resolution to be able to detect single bases. In the early papers methods, a nucleotide needed to be repeated in a sequence about 100 times successively in order to produce a measurable characteristic change. This low resolution is because the DNA strand moves rapidly at the rate of 1 to 5μs per base through the nanopore. This makes recording difficult and prone to background noise, failing in obtaining single-nucleotide resolution. As of 2006, the problem has been tackled by either improving the recording technology or by controlling the speed of DNA strand by various protein engineering strategies and Oxford Nanopore employs a &#x27;kmer approach&#x27;, analyzing more than one base at any one time so that stretches of DNA are subject to repeat interrogation as the strand moves through the nanopore one base at a time. Various techniques including algorithmic have been used to improve the performance of the MinION technology since it was first made available to users. More recently effects of single bases due to secondary structure or released mononucleotides have been shown.

In 2010 Hagan Bayley proposed that creating two recognition sites within an alpha-hemolysin pore may confer advantages in base recognition.

As of 2009, one challenge for the &#x27;exonuclease approach&#x27;, where a processive enzyme feeds individual bases, in the correct order, into the nanopore, has been to integrate the exonuclease and the nanopore detection systems. In particular, the problem is that when an exonuclease hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bonds between nucleotides in DNA, the subsequently released nucleotide is not necessarily guaranteed to directly move into, say, a nearby alpha-hemolysin nanopore. In 2009, one idea has been to attach the exonuclease to the nanopore, perhaps through biotinylation to the beta barrel hemolysin.

The central pore of the protein may be lined with charged residues arranged so that the positive and negative charges appear on opposite sides of the pore. However, this mechanism is primarily discriminatory and does not constitute a mechanism to guide nucleotides down some particular path.

<doc id="733015" wikidata="Q519729" url="?curid=733015" title="Haslach im Kinzigtal">
<text>Haslach im Kinzigtal (, ; ) is a small city in the Black Forest in the district Ortenaukreis, Baden-Württemberg in south-western Germany. In 2015, it comprised a population of 6,893 inhabitants.

Haslach is a member of the &quot;Deutsche Fachwerkstraße&quot;, an association of German cities with examples of the traditional vernacular timber-framed houses.

==History==
The first documentary mention as &quot;Haselahe&quot; dates from 1240.

Haslach earliest proven settlements date back to Roman times. Roman Age finds (pottery shards, stone altar, Roman grave relief) indicate the presence of a settlement here at the time of the construction of a military road through the Kinzig valley (about 74 A.D.). Archaeological finds indicate a Roman road station.

Haslach experienced its first heyday in the 13th century when the town, seat of the mountain judge, became the center of an important silver mining area. From the 17th century, Haslach continued to develop as a market town. Its market streets and squares, which were wide for the time, have been completely preserved to this day and, together with the narrow residential and craft alleys, give the picturesque old town, which consists almost exclusively of baroque half-timbered houses, a unique flair.

After the decline of silver mining in the 16th century, Haslach developed further as an official and market town. In the War of Spanish Succession, it was completely burned down in 1704. Oriented at the medieval town plan, the city then emerged relatively modern timber-framed buildings in southern German baroque style.

During the last months of World War II (September 1944–April 1945), Haslach had three sub-camps of the concentration camp Natzweiler-Struthof at the volcano near the city. Reason for the establishment of the camp was the relocation of production of several arms factories in the bombproof tunnels of the mine Hartsteinwerke volcano. The Vulkan Memorial in Haslach commemorates the 1,700 prisoners from 21 countries who were forced to do labour work. More than 223 inmates known by name lost their lives in Haslach. Others were secretly buried in the vicinity of the camp.

On September 15, 1978, the old town of Haslach was placed under a preservation order by the Freiburg Regional Council. This ordinance serves to preserve the appearance of the old town of Haslach, which is still characterised by its medieval floor plan, within its historical limits.

== Culture ==

=== Annual festivities ===

Source:

* Star singing (Sternesingen): Every evening from January 1 to 6, children dress up as Biblical Magi, accompanied by &quot;Sterndriller&quot; and singers and parade through the city and perform Haslach Christmas Carols, a local collection of Christmas, Shepherd and Epiphany songs in front of every house.
* Day of the stork (Storchentag): February 22 has been &quot;Storchentag&quot; in Haslach for centuries. The possible origin of this usage is the fulfillment of a vow made by the Haslacher on the occasion of a vermin plague in the 17th century. 
* Allemanic Carnival (Fastnacht): Haslach is one of the strongholds of the Alemannic Carnival. It is organised by the fools&#x27; guild that dates back to 1860. The typical Haslach carnival figures include the knapsack guard (many Haslachers say &quot;Fässlemänner&quot;), the Haselnarros and Schellenhansel.
* Scheibenschlagen: Scheibenschlagen is an old Alemannic spring custom. It takes place on the fourth Sunday of Lent (Alemannic: &quot;Lätare&quot;). As darkness falls, a mighty fire blazes and the single young men practice &quot;hitting&quot; the glowing wooden discs. At the end, a mighty, straw-wrapped fire wheel rolls down into the valley.
* Palm Sunday (Palmsonntag): On Palm Sunday, large and small palm trees and palm stalks are brought to the church. These are decorated with box, tuja and holly as well as with colored paper and receive their blessing before entering the church.
* Herbal consecration (Kräuterweihe): On August 15, the feast of the Assumption of Mary, the &quot;herb clump&quot;, a structure made of many herbs, garden onions and ears of grain, is blessed during the church services. The &quot;herb clump&quot; is then stored in the house as protection against illness and danger.
* Shepherds&#x27; singing (Hirtensingen): Usually on the day before New Year&#x27;s Eve, shepherds&#x27; manners and poems are recited against the backdrop of a stable. The &quot;Duweschneck&quot;, a Christmas bread from Haslach, is served with mulled wine.

==== The Hansjakob museum (Freihof) ====
Heinrich Hansjakob (1837–1916) was a pastor in Hagnau (Lake Constance), where he founded the first Baden winegrowers&#x27; cooperative. As a member of the Baden state parliament in Karlsruhe, he was an active politician for 10 years, but he was best known as a writer. Hansjakob has published more than 70 books. He offers an excellent insight into his literary work as an observer of the farmers, craftsmen, citizens and traders of the Baden Black Forest in the 19th century, but also into his work as a historian, publicist, politician and writer. His manuscripts and letters are kept in the Hansjakob archive.

<doc id="733018" wikidata="Q3989133" url="?curid=733018" title="The Saw Doctors">
<text>The Saw Doctors are an Irish rock band. Formed in 1986 in Tuam, County Galway, they have achieved eighteen Top 30 singles in the Republic of Ireland including three number ones. Their first number one, &quot;I Useta Lover,&quot; topped the Irish charts for nine consecutive weeks in 1990 and holds the record for the country&#x27;s all-time biggest-selling single. On 15 February 2008, they received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Meteor Ireland Music Awards.

Their main influences include Bruce Springsteen, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Sex Pistols, The Undertones and John Prine.

==Career==
===Origins and line-up===
The Saw Doctors were formed in 1986 by Leo Moran (formerly a member of defunct Tuam reggae band, Too Much for the White Man), Davy Carton (formerly a songwriter and guitarist with short-lived Tuam punk band Blaze X), and local vocalist Mary O&#x27;Connor. The trio got their start playing small gigs in local venues such as Tuam&#x27;s Imperial Hotel. O&#x27;Connor left the group the following year to emigrate to London. Carton and Moran added other musicians and carried on with the band.

Moran and Carton have been the only constant presences in the Saw Doctors&#x27; ever-shifting line-up. Past members have included musical artist, producer and co producer of the band&#x27;s debut album, John &quot;Turps&quot; Burke &#x27;87 to &#x27;93; bass player Pearse Doherty; keyboard and accordion player Tony Lambert; keyboard player and guitarist Derek Murray; and drummers Padraig Stevens, John Donnelly, Jimi Higgins, and Fran Breen. The fluidity of the band&#x27;s line-up in part accounts for the variety of musical influences, including pop, punk, rock and roll, and traditional Irish, that make up the band&#x27;s signature sound.

As of 2016, the Saw Doctors are Leo Moran (vocals, guitar), Davy Carton (vocals, guitar), Kieran Duddy (keyboards), Anthony Thistlethwaite (saxophone), Will Merrigan (bass) and Rickie O&#x27;Neill (drums).

===Rise to fame===
The Saw Doctors rose to national attention during 1987 and 1988 as they toured in support of popular Irish bands such as the Hothouse Flowers and The Stunning. They also proved to be a success when they played at the 1988 Galway Arts Festival. In the spring of 1988, when The Saw Doctors were playing a six-week residency at the Quays Bar in Galway, their live show attracted the attention of The Waterboys, who were then recording their &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Blues&quot; album in nearby Spiddal. Pub sessions and budding friendships among the two groups would prove fruitful for the Saw Doctors&#x27; future and would see eventual crossovers between the two groups. The band&#x27;s current saxophonist, Anthony Thistlethwaite, and former drummer, Fran Breen, have both been members of The Waterboys.

In the autumn of 1988, The Saw Doctors filmed a rockumentary on a flat-bed truck while driving between Galway and Salthill, a parody of U2&#x27;s newly released &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; film, in which U2 played Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; from a flat-bed truck in San Francisco, The Saw Doctors&#x27; &quot;Crackle and Buzz&quot; had its world premiere at the Claddagh Palace Cinema in Galway. The Saw Doctors played live from the cinema&#x27;s balcony, caricaturing the short acoustic set U2 played atop the Savoy Cinema on O&#x27;Connell Street when &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; premiered there on 27 October 1988. Footage from the tongue-in-cheek stunt was featured on RTÉ&#x27;s main evening news.

In late 1988 and early 1989, The Saw Doctors accompanied The Waterboys on tours of Ireland and Great Britain. In August 1989, The Waterboys&#x27; frontman Mike Scott produced the band&#x27;s first single, &quot;N17,&quot; a song about an Irish emigrant longing to be driving on the N17 national route which connects Galway with County Mayo and County Sligo, passing through the Saw Doctors&#x27; hometown of Tuam. Although &quot;N17&quot; did not chart upon its original release, the band&#x27;s appearance at the inaugural 1990 Féile music festival in Thurles, County Tipperary, cemented their reputation as a live act. The song became known as the band&#x27;s anthem.

Following their success at Féile, the band released their second single, &quot;I Useta Lover,&quot; a humorously off-colour paean to an ex-girlfriend. The single topped the Irish charts in September 1990 and spent nine weeks at number one, becoming Ireland&#x27;s all-time best-selling single. A re-released &quot;N17&quot; reached number one in the Irish charts at Christmas 1990, and the following year, the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;If This Is Rock and Roll, I Want My Old Job Back&quot; entered the Irish albums chart at number one.

In 1992, the band released their second Album &quot;All The Way From Tuam&quot;, which included live favourites &quot;Green &amp; Red of Mayo&quot;, &quot;Exhilarating Sadness&quot; and &quot;You Got Me on the Run&quot; as well as the singles &quot;Wake Up Sleeping&quot;, &quot;Pied Piper&quot;, &quot;Never Mind The Strangers&quot;, &quot;Me Heart Is Living in the Sixties Still&quot; and their next number one hit, &quot;Hay Wrap&quot;. After the release of &quot;All The Way From Tuam&quot;, the band parted company with Warner Music and formed their own record label, Shamtown Records.

The first release under their new Shamtown label was the &quot;Small Bit of Love&quot; EP which gained them their first Top 30 hit in the UK Singles Chart and an appearance on BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

The band released their third studio album &quot;Same Oul&#x27; Town&quot; in February 1996. It went on to peak at number six in the UK Albums Chart. It included the hit singles &quot;World of Good&quot;, &quot;To Win Just Once&quot; and the double A-side &quot;Clare Island&quot; / &quot;Everyday&quot;. The band&#x27;s subsequent work did not reach the same success of &quot;Same Oul&#x27; Town&quot;, and many line-up changes happened over the next few years. However, they had successful British and US tours, and appeared at the Glastonbury Festival and Oxegen.

In October 1998, their fourth album &quot;Songs From Sun Street&quot; was released, which included tracks that had been part of the live show for the previous few years including &quot;Galway &amp; Mayo&quot;, &quot;Tommy K&quot; &amp; &quot;I&#x27;ll Be on My Way&quot;. They also appeared in the 1999 Walter Foote film &quot;The Tavern&quot; as well as contributing songs to its soundtrack.

The fifth studio album &quot;Villains?&quot; was released in 2001 and contained the minor hit &quot;This Is Me&quot;. Entertainment.ie said in its review &quot;to many music fans they&#x27;re a novelty act that&#x27;s long since passed its sell-by date. It would be a shame, however, if their dodgy image obscured the music, since Villains? is by some distance the best album they&#x27;ve ever made.&quot;

Pearse Doherty left the band after the touring of &quot;Villains?&quot; was completed leaving only Carton and Moran as members from the early days. The line-up changed to include Anthony Thistlethwaite on bass guitar. Thistlethwaite had been playing saxophone on and off with the band since the late 1980s, even playing on their first single &quot;N17&quot;.

&quot;Live in Galway&quot; was released on CD and DVD in 2004. Another live album, &quot;Live on News Years Day&quot; as well as the sixth studio album &quot;The Cure&quot; followed. Their career was giving a boost when at the 2008 Meteor Irish Music Awards, The Saw Doctors received the Lifetime Achievement Award. The week before the Meteor Awards the band appeared on the &quot;Podge &amp; Rodge Show&quot; on RTÉ Television. When on the show they covered the Sugababes song &quot;About You Now&quot;, and later decided to release the track as a single. In October 2008 &quot;About You Now&quot; reached number one in the Irish chart, some seventeen years since their last chart-topping feat.

They followed this with the release of another live album and DVD, &quot;Live at the Melody Tent&quot;, recorded in Cape Cod in the summer of 2008. &quot;She Loves Me&quot; charted at number two. In 2009 after six studio albums, Universal Music released &quot;To Win Just Once – The Best of The Saw Doctors&quot;. The compilation album featured twenty two of their tracks, and went platinum within weeks of release.

During 2010, the band played a number of music festival appearances, including playing at the 40th anniversary of the Glastonbury Festival. September 2010 saw the release of their seventh album, &quot;The Further Adventures of... The Saw Doctors&quot;.

In spring 2013, the Saw Doctors announced a break from touring, initially for a year.

In 2016, the band made the announcement that they would be back in the studio, and during the spring and summer of that year, they toured for the first time in over four years. The band toured Ireland, the UK and US and made an appearance on Ireland&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;.

Their tour of the UK and Ireland scheduled for the Autumn and Winter of 2016 was put on hold, as Davy Carton was recovering from a throat operation. The dates were rescheduled to take place in the Spring of 2017.

When the Ireland and UK tour finally took place towards the end of 2017, it was a triumphant success. Subsequently, it was announced that Carton and Moran were writing material for a planned new album.

After a 5-year break from touring, in March 2022, The Saw Doctors announced a 4-date UK Tour for November and December 2022. This tour will consist of dates in Glasgow, London, Leeds and Manchester Apollo.

The Saw Doctors continued their revival in 2023 with shows across Ireland and the U.K. In March, after much speculation, they announced they would play 2 shows in the United States; one in New York City and one in Boston. Tickets for those shows went on sale on April 4th and sold out almost immediately. These were their only US shows of 2023. The New York City show took place on July 7th at the Hammerstein Ballroom and the Boston show took place July 8th at the MGM Music Hall.

On May 24, 2024, the band released a new single titled &quot;Man In The Moon&quot;, whilst also announcing a show at the Hammersmith Apollo on October 31, 2024.

===Live shows and recordings===
Although the Saw Doctors have released a number of studio albums over their career, their live shows have brought them international renown. In 2004, the band recorded its show before a crowd at the Black Box Theatre, Galway, and released a live audio CD and a concert DVD, both titled &quot;Live in Galway&quot;. The DVD also contained a 50-minute documentary, &quot;A Different Kind of World,&quot; following the Saw Doctors around their favourite locales in the West of Ireland (including a trip to Clare Island) and showing them on tour in Brooklyn, New York. A follow-up live album, &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day,&quot; again featured the band in the Black Box Theatre, this time on New Year&#x27;s Day 2005. The band donated profits from this album to victims of 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.

The band performed three songs at Celtic Park, Glasgow on 21 November 2006 before Celtic&#x27;s UEFA Champions League match with Manchester United.

===Other projects===
The Saw Doctors&#x27; song &quot;She Says&quot; is used as the theme song to the BBC Northern Ireland comedy series &quot;Give My Head Peace&quot;. Under the name &quot;The Folk Footballers,&quot; Leo Moran and former Saw Doctor Padraig Stevens released &quot;The First Fifteen,&quot; a collection of songs featuring local artists that celebrated the Galway football team in the wake of its success in the 1998 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. Re-released in 2001, when Galway again won the All-Ireland football championship. Further collaborations brought a self-titled album by another side-project band, The Shambles. Guinness used the Saw Doctors song &quot;Never Mind the Strangers&quot; in an advertisement campaign for Harp Lager in the US. The Saw Doctors made an appearance in &quot;The Tavern&quot; and &quot;Same Oul&#x27; Town&quot; was featured in the film. The Saw Doctors appeared on the 2007 Killinascully Christmas special. The band reappeared in 2010 Killinascully Christmas special.

In 1994 the single &quot;Spanish Lady&quot; was released by Dustin the Turkey and went to No.1 in the Irish Singles Chart on 18 November and stayed there for 4 weeks. Proceeds of the single&#x27;s sale were in aid of the National Council for the Blind of Ireland. It featured Ronnie Drew and The Saw Doctors. Although not mentioned on the cover sleeve The Saw Doctors are clearly identified during the comic number when Dustin sings &quot;Hey Ronnie is that the Saw Doctors? Is it? Who let yous into the studio? Hey eh Leo outta here this is a Dublin Song, meself and Ronnie.&quot; The Saw Doctors proceed to sing a rap verse about cooking turkey and to provide backing vocals until the end of the number.

Man United Man sung by Men United was another Saw Doctor inspired Irish chart topper. Written by Leo Moran and Davy Carton the single&#x27;s proceeds raised money for the RTÉ telethon appeal, People in Need. It reached the peak on 4 May 1996 and remained there for four weeks.

During the Saw Doctors&#x27; break from touring in 2013 three members (Moran, Thistlethwaite and O&#x27;Neill) formed a band with fellow Galway musicians called The Cabin Collective. Moran and Thistlethwaite also tour and record as a duo, Leo and Anto.

==Lottery win==
In April 1993, the Saw Doctors&#x27; keyboard and accordion player Tony Lambert, who had previously played with Bonnie Tyler and Alex Harvey, won IR£852,000 (2023: approx. €2 million) when he won the jackpot in the Irish National Lottery&#x27;s Lotto game. Lambert, who at the time was living in a converted bus that he had driven from his native Wales to Galway and parked just off the N17 road, had purchased his winning ticket in a local Claregalway shop. After his win, he left the band and settled in County Galway, where he restored an old house and built his own recording studio.

Coincidentally, the Saw Doctors&#x27; song &quot;To Win Just Once&quot; was written and recorded shortly before Lambert hit the Lotto jackpot. It is the only song on the &quot;Same Oul&#x27; Town&quot; album featuring him.

He died on 29 April 2018 in Thailand after a long battle with heart disease.

<doc id="733029" wikidata="Q439990" url="?curid=733029" title="Thanom Kittikachorn">
<text>Thanom Kittikachorn (, , ; 11 August 1911 – 16 June 2004) was Prime Minister of Thailand from 1963 to 1973, military officer, who supported and initiated military coups and became Thailand&#x27;s defence minister. He rose to power when he staged a self-coup, until public protests which exploded into violence forced him to step down. His return from exile in 1976 sparked protests which led to a massacre of demonstrators, followed by a military coup.

==Early life==
Thanom Kittikachorn was born in Tak Province to Khun Amphan Kittikachorn and his wife, Linchee Kittikachorn. His family was of Thai Chinese descent. He attended Wat Koak Plu Municipal School, then was admitted to the Army Cadet Academy. After receiving his commission, he reported for duty with Infantry Regiment VII in Chiang Mai. Thanom later studied at the Cartography School and the Infantry School, and graduated from the National Defense College in its first class.

==Rise to power==
After the Anti-Indian sentiment riots and serving in the Shan States of Burma during the British Raj, then Lieutenant Colonel Thanom took part in a successful 1947 coup headed by Colonel Sarit Thanarat. He became a regimental commander and was head of the Lopburi military department. He was soon promoted to colonel, commanding the 11th Infantry Division. Thanom was appointed a member of parliament in 1951, his first political role. He was promoted to major general the same year.

In February 1953, Thanom led the suppression of a rebellion against military rule, and was rewarded with promotion to lieutenant general. He represented Thailand at the ceremony to mark the end of the Korean War in July 1953 and was later promoted as commander of the 1st Region Army.

He was appointed deputy cooperatives minister in 1955. Thanom supported Sarit in his coup against the government of Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, and was subsequently appointed defence minister in Pote Sarasin&#x27;s puppet regime in 1957. Thanom consolidated his power base as the second military leader and right-hand man of Sarit. A few days after the December 1957 general election, in which the pro-government Sahaphum Party (&quot;United Land&quot;) had performed disappointingly, Thanom co-founded the National Socialist Party &quot;(Chat Sangkhomniyom)&quot;. He became the deputy leader of this party, designed to extend the pro-government camp and win over former members of Phibunsongkhram&#x27;s Seri Manangkhasila Party who had been reelected to parliament as independents.

In 1958, he was made a full general and assumed the offices of prime minister and defence minister. He was prime minister for nine months, after which he was replaced by Sarit himself and made deputy prime minister, defence minister, and armed forces deputy supreme commander.

==Prime Minister of Thailand==

Prime Minister Thanom succeeded his predecessor one day after Sarit&#x27;s death in 1963. He subsequently appointed himself commander-in-chief of the army. One year later, he promoted himself to the concurrent ranks of field marshal, admiral of the fleet, and marshal of the air force. Thanom continued the pro-American and anti-communist politics of his predecessor, which helped to ensure massive US economic and financial aid during the Vietnam War. Although he was personally popular, his regime was known for massive corruption. He established and led the United Thai People&#x27;s Party &quot;(Saha Prachathai)&quot; in October 1968.

Thanom reappointed himself prime minister in February 1969 after general elections had been completed. The following year saw the beginnings of the 1970s peasant revolts in Thailand. Then, in November 1971, he staged a coup against his own government, citing the need to suppress communist infiltration. He dissolved parliament and appointed himself Chairman of the National Executive Council, and served as a caretaker government for one year. In December 1972, he appointed himself prime minister for a fourth time, also serving as the defence and foreign ministers. Thanom, his son Colonel Narong, and Narong&#x27;s father-in-law General Praphas Charusathien became known as the &quot;three tyrants&quot;.

Public discontent grew, along with demands for a general election to choose a new parliament. Student-led demands for a return to constitutional government led to days of violence followed by the sudden downfall of his government. Thanom and the other &quot;tyrants&quot; flew to exile in the United States and Singapore. Thanom&#x27;s departure was followed by a restoration of democratic rule in Thailand.

==After step down==

During his exile, Thanom was ordained at Wat Ananda Metyarama in Singapore. In October 1976, Thanom returned to Thailand in the robes of a novice monk, to stay at Bangkok&#x27;s Wat Bowonniwet. Even though he announced he had no desire to enter politics, his return triggered student protests, which eventually moved onto the campus of Thammasat University. This was only a year after South Vietnam and Thailand&#x27;s neighbors Laos and Cambodia had fallen to the communists, and right-wing Thais suspected the protesters wished the same fate for their own country. On 6 October 1976, right-wing militants, aided by government security forces, stormed the Thammasat campus, violently broke up the protests, and killed many protesters. That evening, the military seized power from the elected civilian government of Democrat MR Seni Pramoj and installed hard-line royalist Thanin Kraivichien as premier.

Thanom soon left the monkhood, but he kept his word never to take part in politics again. Late in his life, he attempted to rehabilitate his tarnished image and recover properties seized when his government was overthrown.

Controversy arose in early 1999 when it became known that Thanom was appointed as an honorary officer of the Royal Guard by prime minister Chuan Leekpai as recommended by the military. Thanom settled the matter himself by resigning.

Thanom Kittikachorn died in 2004 the age of 92 in Bangkok General Hospital, after suffering a stroke and a heart attack two years earlier. His family&#x27;s medical expenses were paid by King Bhumibol Adulyadej, which some saw as recognition of Thanom&#x27;s agreeing to the king&#x27;s request that he leave the country to end the violence in 1973. Thanom&#x27;s cremation was held on 25 February 2007 at Wat Debsirin. Queen Sirikit presided over the cremation ceremony, lighting the royal flame on behalf of King Bhumibol. Her youngest daughter, the Princess Chulabhorn, was also present. Thanom&#x27;s wife died in 2012, aged 96.

<doc id="733032" wikidata="Q1331285" url="?curid=733032" title="Elizabeth P. Farrington">
<text>Mary Elizabeth Pruett Farrington (May 30, 1898 – July 21, 1984), more commonly known as Elizabeth P. Farrington, was publisher of the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; and an American politician who served as delegate to the United States Congress for the Territory of Hawai&#x27;i. She was the wife to Joseph Rider Farrington, whom she had succeeded in Washington, D.C. Her father-in-law was the Territorial Governor of Hawai&#x27;i Wallace Rider Farrington.

==Early life==
Farrington was born in Tokyo on May 30, 1898; her parents were Robert and Josie Pruett, who were Christian missionaries from Tennessee. She attended Tokyo Foreign School before moving back to the United States. She attended grammar schools in Nashville, Tennessee, El Paso, Texas, and Los Angeles, California. After graduating from Hollywood High School, Farrington obtained a degree from Ward-Belmont Junior College of Nashville in 1916. She went on to study journalism at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she met her husband. She graduated from Wisconsin in 1918. Newly married, she settled in Honolulu. She became a newspaper correspondent for the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; through 1957.

She and her husband adopted two children.

==Political career==
Farrington was elected President of the League of Republican Women, an office she served in Washington, D.C., from 1946 to 1948. She was then elected to the National Federation of Women&#x27;s Republican Clubs and served as its president from 1949 to 1953. In 1952, Farrington was a delegate for the Territory of Hawai&#x27;i to the Republican National Convention that nominated Dwight Eisenhower to become President of the United States.

Farrington was elected to the United States Congress in a special election to fill a vacancy left by her husband&#x27;s unexpected death. She was subsequently re-elected to a term in her own right, and served from July 31, 1954, to January 3, 1957. In 1956, she lost her bid for re-election to a third term in Congress and returned to her family&#x27;s newspaper business in Honolulu. She was the first woman elected to represent Hawaii in any capacity (territory or state) in the U.S. Congress.

==Newspaper career==
Farrington succeeded her husband&#x27;s office as publisher, president and director of &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot;. She served in those capacities from 1946 to 1961. She concurrently served as director and chairman of the Honolulu Lithograph Company, Limited and president of the Hawaiian Broadcasting System, Limited. She made a brief return to politics when President of the United States Richard Nixon appointed her to be the Director of the Office of Territories of the United States Department of the Interior. After completing her term she retired to Honolulu where she died on July 21, 1984. Her ashes were interred at O&#x27;ahu Cemetery.

<text>James Ralph Sasser (September 30, 1936 – September 10, 2024) was an American politician, diplomat, and attorney from Tennessee. A member of the Democratic Party, he served three terms as a member of the United States Senate from 1977 to 1995, and was Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on the Budget. From 1996 to 1999, during the Clinton Administration, he was the United States Ambassador to China.

==Early life and career==
James Ralph Sasser was born in Memphis, Tennessee, on September 30, 1936. He attended public schools in Nashville, Tennessee, graduating from Hillsboro High School in 1954. He attended the University of Tennessee from 1954 to 1955, where he joined the Lambda chapter of Kappa Sigma fraternity. He earned his undergraduate degree from Vanderbilt University in 1958, followed by his law degree from the Vanderbilt University Law School in 1961. He was admitted to the Tennessee Bar in 1961 and began practicing law in Nashville.

From 1957 to 1963, he served in the United States Marine Corps Reserve.

Sasser was a long time Democratic activist and the manager of Albert Gore Sr.&#x27;s unsuccessful 1970 reelection campaign. A lawyer by trade, Sasser sought election in his own right and won his party&#x27;s 1976 nomination for the United States Senate. He defeated, among others, Nashville, Tennessee entrepreneur and attorney John Jay Hooker, then still considered to be a serious candidate due to his strong personality, his (intermittent) wealth, and his connections with &quot;The Tennessean&quot; controlling Seigenthaler family. His son Gray Sasser, also a lawyer, is a past chair of the Tennessee Democratic Party.

==Senate campaigns==

===1976 election===

Upon winning his party&#x27;s Senate nomination, Sasser set out to attack the record of one-term incumbent Sen. Bill Brock, heir to a Chattanooga, Tennessee candy fortune. Sasser emphasized Brock&#x27;s connections to former President Richard Nixon and his use of income tax code provisions that had, despite his great wealth and considerable income, resulted in his paying less than $2,000 in income tax the previous year. Sasser was able to capitalize on the tax issue by pointing out that Brock had paid less than many Tennesseans of considerably more modest means.

Sasser&#x27;s campaign was also greatly aided by the efforts of ex-Senator Gore. Brock had defeated the elder Gore for the Senate in 1970 largely upon the basis of Gore&#x27;s opposition to the Vietnam War. Sasser won handily over Brock, and went on to serve three terms in the Senate.

===Re-election, 1982 and 1988===

Sasser turned back a serious effort against him by five-term United States House of Representatives member Robin Beard very handily in 1982. That showing was so impressive that his 1988 Republican opponent was a virtual political unknown named Bill Andersen, whose underfunded, essentially token campaign never stood a chance.

===1994 re-election campaign===

There were two unforeseen events that negated Sasser&#x27;s popularity. Some Tennessee voters were discontented with the first two years of the Bill Clinton administration, especially the proposal for a national health-care system largely put together and advocated by Clinton&#x27;s wife, Hillary Clinton, as well as the passage of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. The other was the somewhat unexpected nomination of Nashville, Tennessee heart transplantation surgeon Bill Frist for the seat by the Republicans.

Frist was a political unknown and a total novice (who never voted until he was 36) at campaigning, but was from one of Nashville&#x27;s most prominent and wealthiest medical families, which gave him name recognition, especially in the Nashville area, and resources adequate to match the campaign war chest built up by a typical three-term incumbent, a challenge most &quot;insurgent&quot; candidates find to be extremely difficult. A further factor working to Frist&#x27;s advantage was a simultaneous Republican campaign by actor and attorney Fred Thompson for the other Tennessee Senate seat, which was held to replace Al Gore, who had resigned in 1993 to become Vice President of the United States. To an extent, Frist was able to bask in the reflected glory of this formidable stage presence, and additionally developed some campaigning skills, which were almost totally absent in the early stages of his campaign. Another factor in Frist&#x27;s favor was that Sasser was never seen as possessing much charisma of his own. During the campaign Nashville radio stations were derisive towards Sasser to the point of stating that he could only win &quot;a Kermit the Frog lookalike contest.&quot; In one of the largest upsets in a night of political upsets in the November 1994 U.S. general elections, Sasser lost his seat to Frist by a vote of 834,226 (56%) to 623,164 (42%). Sasser and Pennsylvania&#x27;s Harris Wofford were the only incumbents to lose re-election in the 1994 cycle. As of 2024, Sasser is the last Democrat to have represented Tennessee in the U.S. Senate. 

==Senate accomplishments==
With the retirement of Senator Lawton Chiles in 1989, Sasser became Chairman of the United Senate Committee on the Budget. In that role, he served as a key ally of Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, a United States Senate member of Maine. Sasser helped negotiate the 1990 budget summit agreement with President George H. W. Bush. In 1993 he engineered passage of President Bill Clinton&#x27;s first budget, which reduced the deficit by $500 billion over 10 years but passed without any Republican votes.

With these successes, Sasser began to work his way upward in the party leadership. When then-Senate Majority Leader Mitchell announced his intention to retire, Sasser was widely expected to be elected to the position, had he won a fourth term in the Senate.

==Ambassador to China==

Sasser went on to serve as ambassador to China during the period of alleged nuclear spying and the campaign finance controversy that involved possible efforts by China to influence domestic U.S. politics during the Clinton Administration. Sasser again gained media attention when the U.S. Embassy in Beijing was besieged after U.S. warplanes mistakenly bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade during the U.S. intervention in the Kosovo War. Shortly after the siege of the embassy was lifted, Ambassador Sasser retired (he was slated to do so before the siege, so his retirement was not a direct result) and returned to the United States.

==Later career==
After retiring as ambassador, Sasser worked as a consultant in Tennessee and Washington, D.C., and also lectured at George Washington University. He later became a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

==Personal life and death==
Sasser married Mary Gorman in 1962, and they had two children. He died from a heart attack at his home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, on September 10, 2024, at the age of 87, 20 days before his 88th birthday.

<doc id="733042" wikidata="Q5128335" url="?curid=733042" title="Classical information channel">
<text>In quantum information science, a classical information channel (often called simply classical channel) is a communication channel that can be used to transmit classical information (as opposed to quantum channel which can transmit quantum information). An example would be a light travelling over fiber optics lines or electricity travelling over phone lines.

Although classical channels cannot transmit quantum information by themselves, they can be useful in combination with quantum channels. Examples of their use are:
* In quantum teleportation, a classical channel together with a previously prepared entangled quantum state are used to transmit quantum information between two parties. Neither the classical channel nor the previously prepared quantum state alone can do this task. 
* In quantum cryptography, a classical channel is used along with a quantum channel in protocols for quantum key exchange. 
* In quantum communication, the information rate of a noisy quantum channel can be increased when used together with a noise-free classical channel. In particular, some very noisy quantum channels cannot transmit quantum information if used alone but can transmit it if used together with a classical channel (which is not capable of transmitting quantum information by itself).

<doc id="733062" wikidata="Q409353" url="?curid=733062" title="Poly(p-phenylene vinylene)">
<text>Poly(&quot;p&quot;-phenylene vinylene) (PPV, or polyphenylene vinylene) is a conducting polymer of the rigid-rod polymer family. PPV is the only polymer of this type that can be processed into a highly ordered crystalline thin film. PPV and its derivatives are electrically conducting upon doping. Although insoluble in water, its precursors can be manipulated in aqueous solution. The small optical band gap and its bright yellow fluorescence makes PPV a candidate in applications such as light-emitting diodes (LED) and photovoltaic devices. Moreover, PPV can be doped to form electrically conductive materials. Its physical and electronic properties can be altered by the inclusion of functional side groups.

==Preparation==
PPVs can be synthesized by a variety of methods, the details of which determine purity and molecular weight. The most popular methods proceed via p-xylylene intermediates after a base induced elimination from α,α&#x27;-disubstituted para-xylenes.

===Other methods===
Although xylylene-based routes dominate the synthetic methodology, many other routes have been evaluated.

====Step growth routes====
PPV can be synthesized by Wittig-type couplings between the bis(ylide) derived from an aromatic bisphosphonium salt and dialdehyde, especially 1,4-benzenedialdehyde.
Step growth coupling reactions, such as this Wittig condensation, usually yield low molecular weight oligomer with 5-10 repeat units. Incorporation of various side groups (alkyl, alkoxy, or phenyl) increases the solubility of the polymer and gives higher molecular weights. An advantage of the step-polymerization approach is that ortho-, meta-, and para-xylylene linkages can be incorporated in the main chain. Copolymers of defined stereoregularity can also be easily made in this way.

PPV derivatives can be also produced via the Knoevenagel condensation between a benzylic nitrile and an aromatic dialdehyde. Since this method produces many side reactions, such as hydrolysis of nitrile group, careful optimization of the reaction conditions was needed.
====Heck coupling routes====
The couplings of ethylene with a variety of aromatic dibromides via a Heck reaction give reasonable molecular weights (3,000-10,000) when solubilizing groups present. However, this method requires one of the gaseous starting materials to be added in precise amounts, In excess polyethylene could be formed.
====Ring-opening routes====
A bicyclooctadiene compound has been coupled by ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) to give a precursor polymer of high molecular weight and soluble in organic solvents. This polymer can be deposited as thin films and converted thermally to PPV. Lower conversion temperatures could be employed with the presence of an amine catalyst.
:

A modification of the ROMP route to PPV used a silyl-substituted paracyclophane derivative. Transformation into PPV could be achieved by elimination of the silyloxy group followed by thermal treatment or treating the precursor polymer with acid. The advantage of this method is that polymers and block copolymers of well-defined molecular weight can be easily prepared.
:

==Structure and properties==
Highly oriented PPV films obtained by the soluble polymeric precursor route usually have P21 symmetry with a monoclinic unit cell containing two monomer units: c (chain axis) = 0.658, a = 0.790, b = 0.605 nm, and α (monoclinic angle) = 123o (Figure 1). The structural organization of PPV chains resembles that found in other highly oriented rigid-rod polymers, where the molecules are oriented along the fiber axis (often the stretching direction) but with partial axial translational disorder.
PPV is a diamagnetic material and has a very low intrinsic electrical conductivity, on the order of 10−13 S/cm. The electrical conductivity increases upon doping with iodine, ferric chloride, alkali metals, or acids. However, the stability of these doped materials is relatively low. In general, unaligned, unsubstituted PPV presents only moderate conductivity with doping, ranging from «10−3 S/cm (I2 doped) to 100 S/cm (H2SO4-doped). Draw ratios of up to 10 are possible. Alkoxy-substituted PPVs are generally easier to oxidize than the parent PPV and hence have much higher conductivities. Longer side chains lower the conductivity and hinder interchain hopping of charge carriers.

==Aspirational uses==

Due to its stability, processability, and electrical and optical properties, PPV has been considered for a wide variety of applications. In 1989 the first polymer-based light emitting diode (LED) was discovered using PPV as the emissive layer. Polymers are speculated to have advantages over molecular materials in LEDs, such as ease of processing, reduced tendency for crystallization, and greater thermal and mechanical stability. Ever since the first breakthrough in 1989, a large number of PPV derivatives have been synthesized and used for LED applications. Although solid-state lasing has yet to be demonstrated in an organic LED, poly[2-methoxy-5-(2&#x27;-ethylhexyloxy)-p-phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV) has been proven to be a promising laser dye due to its high fluorescence efficiency in solution.

Polyphenylene vinylene is electroluminescent, suggesting applications in polymer-based organic light emitting diodes. PPV was used as the emissive layer in the first polymer light-emitting diodes. Devices based on PPV emit yellow-green light, and derivatives of PPV obtained by substitution are often used when light of a different color is required. In presence of even a small amount of oxygen, singlet oxygen is formed during operation, by energy transfer from the excited polymer molecules to oxygen molecules. These oxygen radicals then attack the structure of the polymer, leading to its degradation.

PPV has also been investigated as an electron-donor in organic solar cells. PPV-based devices however suffer from poor absorption and photodegradation.

<text>Maurice Lee &quot;Footsie&quot; Britt (June 29, 1919 – November 26, 1995) was an American military officer, businessman, and politician. He played professional football for the Detroit Lions in 1941 before entering active service with the U.S. Army during World War II, during which he was awarded the Medal of Honor. 

Britt served as the 11th Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas during the administration of Governor Winthrop Rockefeller from 1967 to 1971. Rockefeller and Britt were the first Republicans to serve in the state of Arkansas&#x27;s top two offices since Reconstruction.

==Early life==
He was born Maurice Britt in Carlise in Lonoke County in central Arkansas, the son of Maurice Lee and Virgie Britt. His family moved from Carlisle to nearby Lonoke when he was a boy. He received the nickname &quot;Footsie&quot; after winning a pair of shoes at a local fair as an adolescent; he had size-thirteen feet. He graduated as the valedictorian of Lonoke High School in 1937 and entered the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, where he was supported by an athletic scholarship in both football and basketball. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism and an Army Reserve commission as a Second Lieutenant of Infantry through Army Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps upon graduation in 1941. He was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.

==Professional football==

Britt was selected in the 13th round of the 1941 NFL draft by the Detroit Lions, who used the 115th overall pick of the draft to take him. The 6&#x27;4&quot; end signed a contract with the Lions and saw action in nine games during the 1941 season coming off the bench, scoring one league touchdown on a 45-yard passing play. He was unable to complete the season due to the outbreak of World War II.

==World War II==

===US Army===
Britt entered active duty in December 1941 as a second lieutenant at Camp Joseph T. Robinson in North Little Rock. He was assigned to Company L, 3rd Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division during training at Fort Lewis, Washington, Fort Ord, California, and Camp Pickett in Virginia. He received a partial deferment to entering active duty until after the 1941 football season. He initially joined the 3rd Division and participated in coastal defense on the West Coast of the United States. On October 23, 1942, the 30th Infantry and the 3rd Division embarked for North Africa.

; North Africa
On November 8, 1942, he was a platoon leader in Company L when the 3rd Infantry Division and two other U.S. Army divisions landed during the invasion of French North Africa under Major General George S. Patton, Jr. who was in command of the Western Forces. Britt and his unit landed at the North African beach at Casablanca, French Morocco. The 30th Infantry came on shore and quickly secured the left flank of the 3rd Division and silenced Fort Blondin in the process which had been firing on the naval forces lying off the Moroccan coast. 

By November 11, the 30th Infantry and the 3rd Division had secured Casablanca. In January 1943, the 3rd Battalion, 30th Infantry were assigned to personal guard duty for Sir Winston Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Casablanca Conference. At the end of the North African Campaign, the 3rd Division began training in Bizerte, Tunisia for the invasion of Sicily.

; Italy
Britt continued to serve as a platoon leader during the amphibious invasion of Sicily on July 10, 1943. The 3rd Battalion, 30th Infantry executed one of the longest foot marches in modern military history, from near Gela northward to Palermo. The 3rd Battalion marched 54 miles in only 33 hours. Palermo was captured on July 22. Britt led his men through the combat and extensive marching from Palermo to Messina in Sicily.

On September 19, 1943, Britt participated in the amphibious landings in Salerno, Italy during the invasion of Italy (Operation Avalanche). This was his third amphibious assault landing of the war. He took command of Company L after his company commander was wounded and evacuated. On September 22, he led an assault on Acerno, Italy which was 10 miles from Salerno, and destroyed an enemy machine gun position. The 30th Infantry captured Acerno and he received a Silver Star for gallantry in action and his first of four Purple Hearts. 

By early October 1943, the whole of southern Italy was in Allied hands, and the Allied armies faced the Volturno Line, the first of a series of prepared defensive lines running across Italy from which the Germans chose to fight delaying actions, giving ground slowly and buying time to complete their preparation of the Winter Line, their strongest defensive line south of Rome. Britt led his men in the river crossing on the Volturno River. For his actions at Pietravairano on October 29, Britt received the Bronze Star Medal with &quot;V&quot; device. For his actions above and beyond the call of duty on the assault of Monte Retundo on November 10, north of Mignano, in central Italy, he received the Medal of Honor, British Military Cross, Italian Military Medal for Valor, and a battlefield promotion to captain.

He was part of the initial invasion at Anzio on January 22, 1944 (Operation Shingle). On January 23, in one instance at the Pontine Marshes,
Britt and his men were having difficulty locating German gun positions. Captain Britt, in plain view of the German lines, clapped his hands above his head to deliberately draw enemy gunfire, thus exposing a gun position so it could be destroyed. Thereafter American units in the area referred to the intersection there as &quot;Britt&#x27;s Junction&quot;. 

Britt directed mortar and artillery fire from close proximity over the next day, contributing to the destruction of 25 German machine gun positions. Britt was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism for his actions on January 22 and 23 at the Anzio beachhead near Latina.

Britt&#x27;s own war in Europe came to an abrupt end at this time, however. A German tank got into range of Britt&#x27;s command post, a stone farmhouse. The shell it fired passed through three walls, blowing off Britt&#x27;s right arm at the elbow, fracturing a leg, and perforating his back in 47 places. &quot;I sure was lucky,&quot; Britt noted shortly thereafter. &quot;If I&#x27;d been standing a little further over that shell would have killed me.&quot;

In February 1944, he was evacuated to the United States for medical treatment at Lawson General Hospital in Atlanta. While recuperating from his wounds, he participated in a War Bond tour. He received an honorable discharge on December 27, 1944.

Maurice Britt became the first recipient of the top four combat decorations for valor awarded to an infantryman by the US Army during World War II.

==Postwar==
After the war, he briefly attended the University of Arkansas School of Law in Fayetteville but left the institution to enter business. He spent twenty years working at a furniture manufacturing company and then running the Beautyguard Manufacturing Company, a producer of aluminum building products.

In 1966, he was elected lieutenant governor, when the incumbent Democrat, Nathan Green Gordon, did not seek reelection. He was re-elected in 1968 but did not seek a third term in 1970, having deferred to his friend and Little Rock neighbor, Former House Speaker Sterling R. Cockrill, a Democrat-turned-Republican, who ran unsuccessfully on Winthrop Rockefeller&#x27;s losing Republican ticket that year. Britt defeated the Democratic nominees, Judge James H. Pilkington of Hope in 1966 and State Representative Bill Wells of Hermitage in 1968. He was a lifelong Arkansas Republican, having been active in his state&#x27;s Young Republicans in college. Neal Sox Johnson, the first paid executive director of the Arkansas GOP, said that he believed Rockefeller should have stepped down in 1970, and Britt should have been the gubernatorial nominee. Rockefeller was unseated that year by the Democrat Dale Bumpers. As Rockefeller and Britt left office, two legislative Republicans remained behind, State Senator Jim Caldwell and Representative Preston Bynum, both of Benton County in far northwestern Arkansas.

After leaving office, Britt was appointed by the Richard Nixon administration as district director of the Small Business Administration. He served in that capacity from 1971 to 1985.

In 1986, Britt came out of political retirement to seek the Republican gubernatorial nomination. He polled only 3,116 votes (13.9 percent) to 13,831 ballots (61.9 percent) for former Governor Frank D. White. A third candidate, Wayne Lanier, received 4,576 votes (20.5 percent) in a low-turnout primary. White was thereafter defeated in the general election for a second time by future U.S. President Bill Clinton.

Britt was a leader in civic affairs too. He was past state chairman of the Crippled Children&#x27;s Hospital, Easter Seals, and the Federal Executive Association. He was a member of the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame and received the National Collegiate Athletic Association Sports Achievement Award.

==Death==
Britt died of heart failure in the John L. McClellan Memorial Veterans Hospital in Little Rock. He was one of two lieutenant governors in state history to lie in state in the State Capitol Rotunda, the other being Winthrop Paul Rockefeller, the son of Governor Winthrop Rockefeller. The coffin was open, and Britt&#x27;s military coat hung from the back of his favorite rocking chair, which was placed next to the body. His medals and a military cap were placed on a nearby table. An Army Sergeant stood at the head of the casket throughout the six hours that Britt lay in state.

Services were held in the Calvary Baptist Church of Little Rock, where Britt was a member. Burial was in Little Rock National Cemetery.

==Family==
Britt had three daughters, Andrea Schafer and Nancy McDurmont, both of Lonoke, and Patricia Anne Britt of Falls Church, Virginia; two sons, Maurice Lee Britt, III (born ), and his wife, Dee Britt, of Royal, Arkansas, and Timothy Watson Britt (born ) of Little Rock; one brother, B. A. Britt (born ) of Carlisle; twelve grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. Britt&#x27;s wife died shortly before his own death. Britt was a distant cousin of Circuit Judge Henry M. Britt of Hot Springs, the 1960 Republican gubernatorial nominee against Orval Faubus. He was also a cousin of internationally known actress Dorothy Lamour. [4]

<text>Edgar James Banks (May 23, 1866 – May 5, 1945), was an American diplomat, antiquarian and novelist.

==Biography==
Banks was an antiquities enthusiast and entrepreneurial roving archaeologist in the closing days of the Ottoman Empire, who has been held up as an original for the fictional composite figure of Indiana Jones. Starting from his position as American consul in Baghdad in 1898, Banks bought hundreds of cuneiform tablets on the market in the closing days of the Ottoman Empire and resold them in small batches to museums, libraries, universities, and theological seminaries, several in Utah and the Southwestern United States and across the United States. These tablets had been dug up by locals at sites like Telloh and the many other tells of central Mesopotamia. Banks purchased many more cuneiform inscriptions from a dealer in Constantinople. His export of antiquities was an infringement of Article 8 of the 1884 Ottoman Antiquities Law.

He wrote a book, published in 1912, about his excavations of the ancient Sumerian city of Adab, located in what is now Bismya/Bismaya in Iraq. The book contains lively accounts of his excavations in Adab and discoveries of a sequence of buildings from the prehistoric into the reign of Ur-Nammu in the ancient Sumerian city. It details also his extensive expeditions in the region and struggles with the Ottoman bureaucracy which, though he had been funded for an expedition to the site of Ur, had refused permits for digs at Babylon, Tell Ibrahim, or other prominent sites. In 1903 it was decided that his excavations were to be at Bismya, the site of ancient Adab, in Iraq.

In 1909 Banks became a professor of Oriental languages and archaeology at the University of Toledo. After World War I, Banks travelled and lectured extensively, scattering his cuneiform tablets among purchasers wherever he went. Tablets Banks sold to Charles W. Ames are now in the Science Museum of Minnesota, University of Minnesota, and many other private and public sites in the U.S.

Banks is known as the person who sold the ancient mathematical cuneiform tablet Plimpton 322, which was likely excavated in what is now southern Iraq, to the New York publisher George Arthur Plimpton, reportedly for $10. It was housed in Plimpton&#x27;s private collection before being donated to Columbia University shortly before Plimpton&#x27;s death. The artifact contains a table of numbers related to Pythagorean triples, and has been the subject of numerous studies by historians of mathematics.

Edgar Banks also started two film companies and climbed Mount Ararat in a search for Noah&#x27;s Ark. Cecil B. DeMille apparently invited Banks to become a consultant on bible epics in 1921.

Banks was an active lecturer and author. It was during such a lecturing trip in 1921 that he discovered Eustis, Florida, and decided to retire there. He died in Eustis in 1945 at the age of 79. The Eustis Historical Museum features one room with exhibits about Banks.

<text>Arthur Bourchier (22 June 186314 September 1927) was an English actor and theatre manager. He married and later divorced the actress Violet Vanbrugh.

Bourchier was noted for roles both in classical drama, particularly Shakespeare, and in contemporary plays, including works by W. S. Gilbert, Anthony Hope, Arthur Wing Pinero and Alfred Sutro. He managed several West End theatres during his career, including the Royalty, the Criterion, the Garrick (for a total of eight years), His Majesty&#x27;s and the Strand.

In his later years Bourchier became active in British politics as a member of the Labour Party.

==Biography==
Bourchier was born in Speen, Berkshire, England. He was the only son of Fanny (née Farr) and Captain Charles John Bourchier. He was educated at Eton, where he played cricket, and at Oxford University, chiefly at Christ Church. At Oxford he acted with an amateur group called the Philothespian Society, with whom he played Shylock in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. With the encouragement of the Vice-Chancellor, Benjamin Jowett, Bourchier founded the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS), which succeeded the Philothespians. With the OUDS, Bourchier played Hotspur, Falstaff, Feste, Thanatos (in &quot;Alcestis&quot;), and Brutus to the Caesar of H. B. Irving.

===Early career===
Bourchier&#x27;s first professional appearance was with Lillie Langtry in 1889, as Jaques in &quot;As You Like It&quot;. He also acted with Charles Wyndham at the Criterion Theatre and travelled to America to appear with Augustin Daly&#x27;s company, for whom he later played the part of Robin Hood in Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;The Foresters&quot; at its London premiere. In 1893, he appeared together with Violet Vanbrugh, elder sister of Irene Vanbrugh, in Daly&#x27;s production of &quot;Love in Tandem&quot; at Daly&#x27;s Theatre in London. The two married the following year and had a daughter, Prudence Bourchier (b. 1902), who also became an actress and took the stage name Vanbrugh.
In 1895, Bourchier became lessee of the Royalty Theatre, and Violet Vanbrugh became his leading lady in many productions, including &quot;The Chili Widow&quot; (an adaptation of his own, which ran for over 300 nights), &quot;Mr and Mrs&quot;, &quot;Monsieur de Paris&quot; and &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Proctor&quot;. Bourchier, Vanbrugh and her sister Irene toured America beginning in 1897. Returning to England, Vanbrugh played the title role in &quot;Teresa&quot;, which he produced at the Metropole.

In partnership with Charles Wyndham in 1900 at the Criterion, Bourchier produced &quot;His Excellency the Governor&quot;, &quot;Lady Huntworth&#x27;s Experiment&quot;, &quot;The Noble Lord&quot;, and &quot;Mamma&quot;. He became lessee of the Garrick Theatre in September 1900. Over the six years of his management at the Garrick, he produced many plays, often starring himself and Vanbrugh, including &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Move&quot;, &quot;My Lady Virtue&quot;, &quot;Whitewashing Julia&quot;, &quot;The Arm of the Law&quot; and W. S. Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;The Fairy&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; (1904). Their production of &quot;The Walls of Jericho&quot; by Alfred Sutro, in 1904, ran for a very successful 423 performances.

Bourchier and Vanbrugh appeared in command performances before King Edward VII in November 1902 in &quot;Dr Johnson&quot; at Sandringham with Henry Irving&#x27;s company, and in November 1905 in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; at Windsor. They toured in 1908 in &quot;John Glayde&#x27;s Honour&quot;. In 1910, Bourchier joined Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre and appeared in Shakespearian roles including Bottom in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, Brutus in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, Sir Toby Belch in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; and Ford to Tree&#x27;s Falstaff in &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;. He had a notable success as the title character in &quot;Henry VIII&quot; with Tree as Wolsey and Vanbrugh as Queen Katherine, followed by Tree&#x27;s silent film of a shortened version of the play in February 1911. In 1913, Bourchier and Vanbrugh produced their own movie in Germany of scenes from &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

===Later years===
Bourchier returned to manage the Garrick in 1912 for two years. In 1913, he appeared in a revival of &quot;London Assurance&quot; in aid of King George&#x27;s Actors&#x27; pension fund with other stars including Tree, Henry Ainley, Charles Hawtrey, Weedon Grossmith and Marie Tempest. In 1916 he again played Brutus in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, for the Shakespeare tercentenary with Frank Benson as Caesar, H. B. Irving as Cassius and Ainley as Antony. The same year, Bourchier took over management of His Majesty&#x27;s. In 1917, he created the part of Bruce Bairnsfather&#x27;s &quot;Old Bill&quot; in a stage adaptation called &quot;The Better &#x27;Ole&quot; at the Oxford Music Hall, where it ran for over 800 performances.

Bourchier and Vanbrugh continued to play in Shakespeare and other pieces through World War I, but their marriage was becoming difficult. A contemporary later observed, &quot;He treated her very much as Henry VIII treated Anne Boleyn – except he didn&#x27;t quite cut off her head.&quot; They toured together in 1916 but then separated and finally divorced in 1918. Bourchier remarried a much younger actress, Violet Marion Kyrle Bellew in 1918, with whom he continued to appear in contemporary melodramas. Bourchier managed the Strand Theatre from 1919 to 1923. There, in 1922, he appeared as Long John Silver in J. B. Fagan&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. He toured with the play in 1923, and brought it back to the Strand the following year. In 1921 he appeared in the Hugh Ford film &quot;The Great Day&quot;. He also played Iago in 1920.

In his later years, Bourchier became involved in politics, writing a pamphlet for the Independent Labour Party in 1926 on &quot;Art and Culture in Relation to Socialism&quot;. At the time of his death he had been selected as Labour Party parliamentary candidate for Gloucester. At the subsequent election, his Labour Party successor failed by the narrow margin of 493 votes to defeat the Conservative candidate. In the last year of his life Bourchier embarked on a tour of South Africa. His departure was marked by a luncheon at Claridge&#x27;s at which he was presented with a bronze bust of himself commissioned by old members of the OUDS in recognition of his work in founding and later subsidising the society.

Bourchier became ill in South Africa and died of pneumonia in Johannesburg in 1927 at the age of 64.

===Reputation===

&quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; wrote of Bourchier, &quot;A certain coarseness, a certain bluff geniality and with it a certain slyness, were all part of his composition as a stage personality, [but] in spite of his great vitality it was not in violent or exuberant parts that he shone... his artistic merit was that he could always get his best effects very quietly.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; said, &quot;Never a great actor, he was nevertheless always a conspicuous figure in the theatrical world. He brought to his work an enthusiasm for the stage which gave to performances not artistically distinguished a curious effect of personal distinction... Sometimes his interpretations seemed to be misguided and his methods extravagantly theatrical, but here at least was an actor who was never colourless and, therefore, seldom dull.&quot;

The critic C. E. Montague was quoted as saying of Bourchier&#x27;s Macbeth, &quot;Even murder cannot be as serious as all that.&quot; Gilbert said of Bourchier&#x27;s Hamlet, &quot;At last we can settle whether Bacon or Shakespeare wrote the plays. Have the coffins opened and whichever has turned in his grave is the author.&quot;

<text>Abbevillian (formerly also &quot;Chellean&quot;) is a term for the oldest lithic industry found in Europe, dated to between roughly 600,000 and 400,000 years ago.

The original artifacts were collected from road construction sites on the Somme river near Abbeville by a French customs officer, Boucher de Perthes. He published his findings in 1836.
Subsequently, Louis Laurent Gabriel de Mortillet (1821–1898), professor of prehistoric anthropology at the School of Anthropology in Paris, published (1882) &quot;Le Prehistorique, antiquité de l&#x27;homme&quot;, in which he was the first to characterize periods by the name of a site. 

Chellean included artifacts discovered at the town of Chelles, a suburb of Paris. They are similar to those found at Abbeville. Later anthropologists substituted Abbevillian for Chellean, the latter of which is no longer in use.

Abbevillian tool users were the first archaic humans in Europe, classified as either late Homo erectus
as Homo antecessor or as Homo heidelbergensis.

==History ==
The label Abbevillian prevailed until the Leakey family discovered older (yet similar) artifacts at Olduvai Gorge (a.k.a. Oldupai Gorge), starting in 1959, and promoted the African origin of man. Olduwan (or Oldowan) soon replaced Abbevillian in describing African and Asian paleoliths. The term Abbevillian is still used, but it is now restricted to Europe. The label, however, continues to lose popularity as a scientific designation.

Mortillet had portrayed his traditions as chronologically sequential. In the Abbevillian, early Palaeolithic hominins used cores; in the Acheulian, flakes. Olduwan tools, however, indicate that in the earliest Palaeolithic, the distinction between flake and core is less clear. Consequently, there also is a tendency to view Abbevillian as an early phase of Acheulian.

==Provenience of the type==
The Abbevillian type site is on the 150-foot terrace of the River Somme. Tools found there are rough chipped bifacial handaxes made during the Elsterian Stage of the Pleistocene Ice Age, which covered central Europe between and years ago.

The Abbevillian is a phase of Olduwan that occurred in Europe near, but not at, the end of the Lower Palaeolithic (2.5 mya. – 2,500,000 years ago). Those who adopt the Abbevillian scheme refer to it as the middle Acheulian, about - years ago. Geologically it occurred in the Middle Pleistocene, younger than about 700,000 years ago. It spanned the Günz-Mindel interglacial period between the Günz and the Mindel, but more recent finds of the East Anglian Palaeolithic push the date back into the Günz, closer to the ya mark.

The Abbevillian culture bearers are not believed to have evolved in Europe, but to have entered it from further east. It was thus preceded by the earlier Olduwan of Homo erectus, and the Upper Acheulian, of which Clactonian and Tayacian are considered phases, supplanted it. 
The Acheulian there went on into the Levalloisian and Mousterian are associated with Neanderthal man.

==Abbevillian sites in Europe==
To avoid the question of what culture name should be used to describe European artifacts, some, such as Schick and Toth, refer to &quot;non-handaxe&quot; and &quot;handaxe&quot; sites. Handaxes came into use at about the 500,000 ya mark. Non-handaxe sites are often the same sites as handaxe sites, the difference being one of time, or, if geographically different, have no discernible spatial pattern. The physical evidence is summarized in the table below Note that the dates assigned vary widely after 700,000 ya and, except where substantiated by scientific methods, should be viewed as tentative and on the speculative side.

<doc id="733092" wikidata="Q1072880" url="?curid=733092" title="Long-nosed caenolestid">
<text>The long-nosed caenolestid (Rhyncholestes raphanurus), also known as the Chilean shrew opossum or long-nosed shrew opossum, is a shrew opossum that occurs in temperate forests of Argentina and southern Chile. It was first described by American zoologist Wilfred Hudson Osgood in 1924. The long-nosed caenolestid resembles &quot;Caenolestes&quot; species in morphology. It is characterized by a long, pointed snout, small eyes and ears, and one claw on a digit of each of the thin limbs. Little is known of its behavior; it appears to be terrestrial (lives on land), nocturnal (active mainly at night) and omnivorous. It prefers cool, moist areas, and has a small distribution. It is classified as near threatened by the IUCN.

== Taxonomy and etymology ==
The long-nosed caenolestid is the sole member of its genus, and is classified in the family Caenolestidae. It was first described by American zoologist Wilfred Hudson Osgood in 1924. Two subspecies are recognised:
*&quot;R. r. continentalis&quot; : Occurs in Argentina and Chile (type locality: Cerro la Picada in Los Lagos, Chile).
*&quot;R. r. raphanurus&quot; : Occurs in southern Chiloé Island (off the coast of Chile).

A 2013 morphological and mitochondrial DNA-based phylogenetic study showed that the Incan caenolestid (&quot;Lestoros inca&quot;) and the long-nosed caenolestid form a clade sister to &quot;Caenolestes&quot;. The cladogram below is based on this study.

Caenolestid fossils date to as early as the early Eocene (nearly 55 mya). The generic name derives from the Greek words &quot;rhynchos&quot; (&quot;snout&quot;) and &quot;lestes&quot; (&quot;robber&quot;, &quot;pirate&quot;). The specific name comes from the Greek &quot;raphanos&quot; (&quot;cabbage&quot;), referring to the thick tail of this caenolestid. The Spanish name for this caenolestid, &quot;comadrejita trompuda&quot;, is the combination of &quot;comadreja&quot; (&quot;weasel&quot;) and &quot;trompa&quot; (&quot;snout&quot;). Other names for this shrew opossum are Chilean shrew opossum or Chilean caenolestid.

== Description ==
The long-nosed caenolestid resembles &quot;Caenolestes&quot; species in morphology. In his 1924 account, Osgood recorded external measurements of three specimens. The head-and-body length ranged from , skull length was between and hind feet measured . The smooth coat is dark greyish brown, without countershading (greater pigmentation on the upper side). It is characterized by a long, pointed snout, small eyes and ears, and one claw on a digit of each of the thin limbs. This shrew opossum lacks a marsupium (young are attached to the nipples) and has seven nipples, unlike the four typical of other caenolestids. The tail helps in balancing the body during locomotion; the relatively shorter tail could imply lesser agility in the long-nosed caenolestid in comparison to other caenolestids. Moreover, the tail can be used to store fat, and is reportedly thickest during early winter.
A 2007 study recorded dental anomalies such as missing teeth and supernumerary teeth. The rodent-like incisors help in killing vertebrate prey and searching for insects in crevices. The pattern of tooth eruption appears to be largely consistent in all caenolestids – the eruption of procumbent (trailing along the surface without spreading out roots) incisors, followed by the development of closely spaced incisors that distance from one another as the mandible grows, and then the eruption of molars and premolars.

== Ecology and behavior ==
Little is known of the behavior of the long-nosed caenolestid. It appears to be terrestrial (lives on land) and nocturnal (active mainly at night). An omnivore, it feeds on insects and small invertebrates as well as plant material and fungi. The caenolestid appears to live in burrows and fallen logs; nests may be used temporarily. Lactating females have been reported in May as well as from October to March. The long-nosed caenolestid is a nocturnal species.

== Distribution and status==
The long-nosed caenolestid occurs in temperate forests of Argentina and southern Chile, and up to altitudes of above the sea level (in Osorno Province, Chile). It prefers cool, moist areas. By 2011 it was known from less than 25 locations, having a very small distribution. This shrew opossum also marks the southern limit of the distribution of caenolestids. In 2023 the species was reported from 17 sites within the Valdivian Coastal Reserve and the Alerce Costero National Park. Though locally abundant, the survival of the caenolestid is threatened by deforestation. Its population has declined by nearly 20% since the 1990s due to deforestation and human settlement. The IUCN classifies the long-nosed caenolestid as near threatened.

<text>Louis Bourdaloue (20 August 1632 – 13 May 1704) was a French Jesuit and preacher.

==Biography==
Louis Bourdaloue was born in Bourges where his father practiced law. He began his studies at the Jesuit Collège de Sainte-Marie in Bourges. In November 1648 he entered the Society of Jesus, and was appointed successively professor of rhetoric, philosophy and moral theology, in various Jesuit colleges. His success as a preacher in the provinces led his superiors to call him to Paris in 1669 to occupy for a year the pulpit of the church of St. Louis. He was friends with Jacques-Benigne Bossuet, although they had very different styles and approaches to preaching. 

He preached at the court of Versailles during the Advent of 1670 and the Lent of 1672, and was subsequently called again to deliver the Lenten course of sermons in 1674, 1675, 1680 and 1682, and the Advent sermons of 1684, 1689 and 1693. This was all the more noteworthy as it was the custom never to call the same preacher more than three times to court. Bourdaloue earned a reputation as an outstanding preacher.

Places were secured at daybreak; princes and prelates crowded to hear him, and on one memorable occasion, several of the most distinguished members of the hierarchy, among them Bossuet himself, withdrew in anger because the seats they claimed were not granted. Bossuet himself, however, remained in a gallery apart to listen to the discourse. Madame de Sévigné was a great admirer.

On the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes he was sent to Languedoc to confirm the new converts in the Catholic faith, possibly at the request of Anne-Jules, 2nd Duke of Noailles. He had much success in this delicate mission. Catholics and Protestants came in throngs to hear him, and were unanimous in praising his fiery eloquence in the Lent sermons which he preached at Montpellier in 1686.

His strength lay in his power of adapting himself to audiences of every kind. His influence was reportedly due as much to his character and his manners as to the force of his reasoning. Voltaire said that his sermons surpassed those of Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet (whose retirement in 1669, however, practically coincided with Bourdaloue&#x27;s early pulpit utterances), and it is said that their simplicity and coherence as well as the direct appeal that they made to hearers of all classes gave them a superiority over the more profound sermons of Bossuet. 

Bourdaloue generally addressed issues of morality in daily life and his experience as a confessor gave him insight into people wrestling with ethical issues. Many of his sermons have been adopted as textbooks in schools. 

Towards the close of his life he confined his ministry to charitable institutions, hospitals and prisons. He died in Paris on 13 May 1704 at the age of seventy-one.

His sermons were revised and edited by François de Paule Bretonneau. Eight of his sermons were translated and published as &quot;Eight Sermons for Holy Week and Easter&quot; by George Francis Crowther in 1884.

<text>François Louis Bourdon (11 January 1758 – 22 June 1798), also known as Bourdon de l&#x27;Oise, was a French politician of the Revolutionary period and &quot;procureur&quot; at the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris.

==Biography==
Born in Rouy-le-Petit (Somme), he was from early on an advocate of revolutionary doctrines, and took an active part in the insurrection of 10 August 1792. Representing the &quot;département&quot; of the Oise in the National Convention, he voted for the immediate execution of King Louis XVI.

He accused the Girondists of relations with the Bourbons, then turned against Maximilien Robespierre, who had him expelled from the Jacobin Club for his conduct as commissioner of the Convention with the French Revolutionary Army troops in La Rochelle.

On 27 July 1794, at the onset of the Thermidorian Reaction, he was one of the deputies delegated to aid Paul Barras to repress the insurrection of the Paris Commune in favour of Robespierre. Bourdon then became a violent reactionary, attacking the former members of The Mountain and supporting rigorous measures against the rioters of the 12 Germinal Year III, and that of 1 Prairial Year III.

In the Council of Five Hundred under the French Directory, Bourdon belonged to the party of &quot;Clichyens&quot;, composed of crypto-Royalists, against whom the directors used the Coup of 18 Fructidor. Bourdon was arrested and deported to French Guiana, and died soon after his arrival in Sinnamary.

<text>Charles &quot;Skip&quot; Pitts (April 7, 1947 – May 1, 2012) was an American soul and blues guitarist. He is best known for his distinctive &quot;wah-wah&quot; style, prominently featured on Isaac Hayes&#x27; title track from the 1971 movie &quot;Shaft&quot;. He is widely considered to have been one of the architects of soul, R&amp;B and funk guitar.

==Early career==
Pitts learned to play guitar at age 11 on the street corners of his childhood hometown, Washington D.C., often receiving tips from his neighbor, Bo Diddley. Pitts&#x27; uncle owned a hotel next to the Howard Theater, where he was introduced to soul and R&amp;B musicians such as James Brown and Otis Redding.

At the age of 17, Pitts performed on Gene Chandler&#x27;s &quot;Rainbow &#x27;65,&quot; which would become his first appearance on many hit recordings. Pitts soon became the guitarist and bandleader for Wilson Pickett&#x27;s Midnight Movers, backing Pickett and Sam &amp; Dave.

In 1969, Pitts joined The Isley Brothers band, for whom he created the signature riff for their chart-topping hit &quot;It&#x27;s Your Thing.&quot;

==With Isaac Hayes (1971-2008)==
In 1970, Pitts moved to Memphis, Tennessee, to join Isaac Hayes&#x27; band. A year later, Pitts created the wah-wah guitar intro for &quot;Theme From Shaft&quot;, a song which earned Hayes an Academy Award.

Pitts went on to work with Hayes over the next three decades, appearing on many of Hayes&#x27; hit albums and soundtracks. He can be seen onstage performing with Hayes in the documentary &quot;Wattstax&quot; (1973) and in the blaxploitation film &quot;Truck Turner&quot; (1974). In the 1990s and 2000s, Pitts collaborated with Hayes on the John Singleton remake of &quot;Shaft&quot; as well as the soundtrack for the animated series &quot;South Park&quot;, for which he received a gold record.

Pitts remained the band&#x27;s guitarist and bandleader until Hayes&#x27; death in August 2008.

==Stax Records==
When not working with Hayes, Pitts served as a session musician at Stax Records. His performances included hits by Rufus Thomas (&quot;The Breakdown&quot;), The Temprees (&quot;This is Dedicated to the One I Love&quot;), The Soul Children, and Albert King.

More recently, Pitts&#x27; guitar playing was introduced to a new generation, when the hip-hop community began sampling classic Stax recordings. His guitar riffs have been sampled by Dr. Dre with Snoop Dogg, Beastie Boys, Massive Attack, Eazy-E, and DJ Shadow with Cut Chemist.

==The Bo-Keys==
In 1998, Pitts became a founding member of The Bo-Keys, a soul/jazz group formed by producer Scott Bomar as an homage to Memphis&#x27; rich musical tradition. He appeared with the band at venues and festivals nationally and internationally, including The Ponderosa Stomp, London&#x27;s Barbican Performing Arts Centre, and Lincoln Center&#x27;s Midsummer Nights Swing Series. He is prominently featured on The Bo-Keys 2011 release, &quot;Got to Get Back!&quot; The album led to a feature in the July 2011 issue of &quot;Guitar Player Magazine&quot;.

==Elmo and The Shades==
Pitts was associated with the eclectic Memphis blues and soul band Elmo and the Shades from the early 1990s, and occasionally appeared as a duo with Elmo Lee Thomas called The Skip and Elmo Show. He performed on the band&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Blue Memphis&quot;.

==Other notable recordings==
Pitts appeared on Al Green&#x27;s Grammy nominated record &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stop&quot;, produced by Willie Mitchell, as well as Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s Grammy nominated &quot;Memphis Blues&quot;. He performed singles from the album with Lauper on the television shows &quot;The Apprentice&quot; and &quot;Late Night with David Letterman.&quot;

==Film work==
In addition to &quot;Wattstax&quot; and &quot;Truck Turner&quot;, Pitts appeared in the award-winning &quot;Forty Shades of Blue&quot;, Craig Brewer&#x27;s &quot;Black Snake Moan&quot;, and &quot;Soul Men&quot; featuring Bernie Mac and Samuel L. Jackson, for which he also contributed three songs to its soundtrack. The song &quot;Soul Music&quot; by Anthony Hamilton was nominated for a Grammy. Further, he performed on the score for the Academy Award winning film &quot;Hustle and Flow&quot; with The Bo-Keys.

Due to his association with the wah-wah pedal, Pitts was interviewed for the documentary &quot;Cry Baby: The Pedal That Rocks the World&quot; alongside Slash, Buddy Guy, Eddie Van Halen, and Kirk Hammett.

==Awards and outreach==
Pitts taught at-risk youth at Memphis&#x27; Stax Music Academy in the early 2000s.

He was the voice of the Memphis Police Department&#x27;s &quot;Blue Crush&quot; advertisement campaign, an effort to reduce street crime in the city.

In 2011, Pitts received a brass note on the Beale Street Walk of Fame.

==Death==
Pitts died of cancer in Memphis, Tennessee, on May 1, 2012. He was 65 years old.

<text>A federal capital is a political entity, often a municipality or capital city, that serves as the seat of the federal government. A federal capital is typically a city that physically encompasses the offices and meeting places of its respective government, where its location and relationship to subnational states are fixed by law or federal constitution. Federal capitals may or may not be considered states in themselves, and either exercise significant political autonomy from the federation or are directly ruled by the national government located within their premises, as federal districts.

Federal capitals are often new creations. That is, they are not established in one of the existing state capitals (but they may well be a pre-existing city). They have not grown organically as capitals tend to do in unitary states. This is because the creation of a federation is a new political entity and it is usually necessary not to favour any one of the constituent state capitals by making it the federation capital. This is also the motivation behind the creation of federal capital territories as districts governed apart from the constituent state governments. It is especially important that the choice of federal capital be neutral in multi-ethnic states such as Nigeria.

Examples of well-known federal capitals include Washington, D.C., which is not part of any U.S. state but borders Maryland and Virginia; Berlin, which is a state of Germany in its own right and forms an enclave within the much larger state of Brandenburg; and the Australian Capital Territory, a territory of Australia which includes the capital city of Australia, Canberra.

Canada is the only federation in the world not to accord a special administrative subdivision to its capital. Rather, Ottawa is merely another municipality in the Province of Ontario. The Canadian government does designate the Ottawa area as the National Capital Region, although this term merely represents the jurisdictional area of the government agency that administers federally owned lands and buildings, and is not an actual political unit. The City of Ottawa is governed as any other city in Ontario would be.

==Early capitals of the United States==

During and immediately after the American Revolution, eight cities served in turn as the capital of the new country:

* Philadelphia, Pennsylvania served at various times as the home of the Continental Congress, then as capital of the US under the Articles of Confederation and from 1790 to 1800 while Washington, D.C. was being built.
* Baltimore, Maryland late 1776–1777.
* Lancaster, Pennsylvania September 1777.
* York, Pennsylvania September 1777–June 1778.
* Princeton, New Jersey Summer 1783.
* Annapolis, Maryland November 1783–August 1784.
* Trenton, New Jersey November–December 1784.
* New York, New York 1785–1790.

<doc id="733123" wikidata="Q18639200" url="?curid=733123" title="English concertina">
<text>The English concertina is a member of the concertina family of free-reed musical instruments. Invented in England in 1829, it was the first instrument of what would become the concertina family.

It is a fully chromatic instrument, having buttons in a rectangular arrangement of four staggered rows; its buttons are unisonoric, producing the same note on both the push and pull of the bellows. It differs from other concertinas in that the scale is divided evenly between the two hands, such that playing a scale involves both hands alternately playing each note in sequence.

==History==
The invention of the instrument is credited to Sir Charles Wheatstone; his earliest patent of a like instrument was granted 19 December 1829, No 5803 in Great Britain.

The English concertina was initially used for playing classical music, virtuosic solos, and chamber music. By the 1860s-1870s, the English concertina grew more popular in the music hall tradition. The evangelical Salvation Army adopted all systems of the concertina as a more portable and flexible alternative to brass instruments, and published a number of tutor books showing the complexity and range of the music they played on the English system.

===Folk music===

====England====
In the English Folk Revival of the 1960s, though the English concertina had been more an art music instrument, it became popular with British folk musicians. Karl Dallas has suggested that the mere presence of &#x27;English&#x27; in the name attracted some of the revival&#x27;s demographic; however the instrument&#x27;s versatility and portability were also important as factors in the instrument&#x27;s adoption. Alf Edwards was a regular accompanist to both A. L. Lloyd and Ewan MacColl, and taught the instrument to Peggy Seeger. His virtuosic and reliable playing was a key element in the adoption of the English concertina by the English folk revival, featuring prominently on influential records such as The Iron Muse and on the Radio Ballads.

Later in the 1960s Alistair Anderson became known for interpreting the traditional dance music of Britain, particularly that of Northumbria. The English concertina has a strong representation amongst amateur players of English folk music; modern nationally known folk performers on the English concertina include Robert Harbron, Sandra Kerr, Graham Kennett, and the Scottish musician Simon Thoumire.

====Ireland====
The English concertina found limited use in Irish traditional music – significantly less than the Anglo concertina. Rick Epping plays Irish music on the harmonica whilst accompanying himself on English concertina.

====South Africa====
Although the Boeremusiek of the Afrikaner people of South Africa was predominantly played on the Anglo concertina, English system players were also recorded.

References in Boeremusiek to the &quot;4-ry&quot; (four row) concertina refer to the English system. Boer musicians used the actual word &quot;English&quot; to mean Anglo system instruments made by English firms such as Lachenal &amp; Co. and Wheatstone (and, less frequently, English and Duet system instruments made by those English companies).

====Latin America====
While it was primarily the bandoneon concertina which achieved success in South America, the English concertina gained some popularity in Bolivia, particularly in the Cochabamba region. It is theorized the instrument may have been brought there by foreign technicians working on the Bolivian Railway or the Patiño mines.

==Play==

The English concertina is typically held by placing the thumbs through thumb straps and the little fingers on metal finger rests, leaving three fingers free for playing. Many players also intermittently or continuously use the little finger to play notes, thus playing with all four fingers and relying upon the thumb straps to support the instrument. Heavier and larger instruments were often fitted with wrist straps and/or a neck sling to further support the weight of the instrument.

The two innermost rows of the layout constitute a diatonic C major scale, distributed alternately between the two sides of the instrument. Thus in a given range, C-E-G-B-d is on one side, D-F-A-c-e on the other. The two outer rows consist of the sharps and flats required to complete the chromatic scale. This distribution of scale notes between sides facilitates rapid melodic play.

English-system treble and tenor-treble concertinas usually span 3 1/2 or 4 octaves. Baritones are similar, but transpose down one octave. Bass concertinas transpose two octaves down, Contrabass Concertinas 3 Octaves down and piccolo concertinas play one octave up.

The standard keyboard arrangement across treble, baritone and bass instruments has middle C on the button nearest the player on the second row of the left hand keyboard; tenor instruments may have that position button as the F below middle C.

Tenor, baritone and bass concertinas often have an air valve in the position that would otherwise be occupied by the instrument&#x27;s highest note. The air button is an essential feature of many bass concertinas which only have reeds to sound on the push bellows direction, due to the increased size of the reeds.

==Performers and repertoire==
Giulio Regondi was a virtuoso performer and composer on this instrument as well as the guitar, and helped to popularize the instrument during the 19th century. In the classical style of Regondi, the little finger is used as well as the other three fingers, and the metal finger rests are used only very occasionally. This allows all eight fingers to simultaneously play the instrument so large chords are possible. In pieces such as the Bernhard Molique &quot;Concerto No 1 in G for concertina and orchestra&quot;, or Percy Grainger&#x27;s &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Hey&quot;, four, five, and six note chords are not uncommon, and would be difficult or impossible to play without using all the fingers.

Allan Atlas, in his book &quot;The Wheatstone Concertina in Victorian England&quot; identifies six known concertos written for this instrument.

<doc id="733132" wikidata="Q270552" url="?curid=733132" title="Antoinette Bourignon">
<text>Antoinette Bourignon de la Porte (13 January 161630 October 1680) was a French-Flemish mystic and adventurer. She taught that the end times would come soon and that the Last Judgment would then fall. Her belief was that she was chosen by God to restore true Christianity on earth and became the central figure of a spiritual network that extended beyond the borders of the Dutch Republic, including Holstein and Scotland. Bourignon&#x27;s sect belonged to the spiritualist movements that have been characterized as the &quot;third power&quot;.

==Early years==
Antoinette was born to a family of wealthy Catholic merchants in Lille in 1616. She was born with a severe cleft lip and palate, and initially &quot;it was debated whether her life was worth preserving&quot;, although a subsequent surgery completely removed the birth defect. By her own account, she was attracted to religion from an early age, lecturing her parents on religion as young as five.
==Career==
In 1636, she fled a marriage her father had arranged for her, but was brought back home shortly after. After eighteen months at home, she left to form an ascetic community at Mons, the first of many attempts in her life to create a new community around revelations she believed to have been revealed directly to her.

Antoinette would have preferred to have joined a strict religious order, the Discalced Carmelites. In 1653 she founded a girls’ orphanage with inheritance money. In 1662 she fled to Ghent and Mechelen, after the magistrate investigated the harsh regime of the orphanage after one of the girls died there. Bourignon claimed to be in direct connection with God and accused the girls of having a pact with the devil.

Bourignon disliked the lavish splendour of the Catholic Church and wanted to establish a community of what she saw as true Christians. It was her view that only &quot;true Christians&quot; would be saved and Bourignon was - according to her - obliged by God to gather these true Christians. In Mechelen she won her first follower, Christiaan de Cort. De Cort had grand plans to establish a new colony on Nordstrand, an island off the coast of Schleswig-Holstein. There a Roman Catholic community had been established since 1652 consisting of dyke workers from Brabant. In 1667 she moved with De Cort to Amsterdam to attract more sponsors. There she met Jean de Labadie, Comenius and Anna Maria van Schurman and began publishing her writings.

Her intense religiosity, unorthodox views and disregard of all sects drew both persecution and followers. Much of the criticism levelled at her was because she was acting as a spiritual leader of a largely male group, many of them married men. They included merchants, craftsmen, doctors (such as Steven Blankaart), painters, rentiers, clerics and scholars (such as Robert Boyle, who had her work translated into English), and Comenius, who invited her to his deathbed. Subsequently, she gained the support of Jan Swammerdam, who was in a spiritual crisis and did not fully trust her, and the owner of Nyenrode Castle, Johan Ortt.

In 1671, she inherited a portion of the island of Nordstrand, not far from Husum, from De Cort, who left large debts after his death. There, she moved with a few followers and started a commune. She set up a printing press and carried on attracting controversy, calling herself the &quot;new Eve&quot; until her press was confiscated by the local government. She then fled to Husum, in an area then known for its religious tolerance and freedom.

Setting up another printing press, Bourignon and her followers distributed her writings at fairs and annual markets. In 1675 Jan Swammerdam visited the community. He had burned his study of the silkworm on her advice. Swammerdam traveled to Copenhagen to visit the mother of Nicolaus Steno, and immediately returned to Amsterdam. He failed to finish his work The Book of Nature, which was full of mystical poems and phrases.

The community, consisting of six wealthy and educated persons, failed when the only other woman refrained from further service. The printing press was confiscated by the Lutheran government. Bourignon was accused of witchcraft and so hurriedly departed to Hamburg. Her stay there was brief; opposition from the Lutheran clergy there forced her to move to East-Friesland, accompanied by Pierre Poiret. There she attempted to found a hospital in the outbuildings of a chateau in Lütetsburg. But by then she was losing much of her support and so decided to return to Amsterdam. On her way there, she fell ill and was stranded in Franeker, Friesland, where she died on 30 October 1680.

==Legacy==
After her death, most of her followers drifted away; a small group remained who edited and circulated her unpublished writings. In 1686, her collected works were published in 19 volumes by the Amsterdam publisher John Wetstein. Finally a large part of her manuscripts ended up at the Aalmoezeniersweeshuis (Orphanage) and the Remonstrant Congregation of Amsterdam through Volckert van de Velde. The entire collection now rests in the library of the University of Amsterdam.

In the early 18th century, her influence was revived in Scotland (see Andrew Michael Ramsay), sufficiently to call forth several denunciations of her doctrines in the various Presbyterian general assemblies of 1701, 1709 and 1710.

==Writings==
Her writings, containing an account of her life and of her visions and opinions, were collected by her disciple, Pierre Poiret (19 vols, Amsterdam, 1679–1686), who also published her life (2 vols, 1683): 
*&quot;La vie de Damlle Antoinette Bourignon. Ecrite partie par elle-méme, partie par une personne de sa connoissance, dans les Traités dont on void le tiltre a la page suivante.&quot; Amsterdam: J. Riewerts &amp; P. Arents, 1683. The first volume of the book (pp. 137–223) contains her autobiography up to 1668.
For a critical account see Hauck, &quot;Realencylopädie&quot; (Leipzig, 1897), and &quot;Étude sur Antoinette Bourignon&quot;, by M. E. S. (Paris, 1876). Three of her works at least have been translated into English, some by Robert Boyle in an earlier stage:

*&quot;An Abridgment of the Light of the World&quot; (London, 1786)
*&quot;A Treatise of Solid Virtue&quot; (1699)
*&quot;The Restoration of the Gospel Spirit&quot; (1707).

<doc id="733140" wikidata="Q1335689" url="?curid=733140" title="White Lion">
<text>White Lion was a Danish-American glam metal band that was formed in New York City in 1983 by Danish vocalist/guitarist Mike Tramp and Italian-American guitarist Vito Bratta. Mainly active in the 1980s and early 1990s, they released their debut album &quot;Fight to Survive&quot; in 1985. The band achieved success with their No. 8 hit &quot;Wait&quot; and No. 3 hit &quot;When the Children Cry&quot; from their second album, the double platinum selling &quot;Pride&quot;. The band continued their success with their third album, &quot;Big Game&quot; which achieved Gold status and their fourth album &quot;Mane Attraction&quot; which included a supporting tour. White Lion disbanded in 1992 and not long afterwards, their first compilation album, &quot;The Best of White Lion&quot; was released.

Mike Tramp reformed White Lion with all new musicians in 1999 and again in 2004, following a failed attempt to reform the original line up. The new White Lion released a live album in 2005 and a brand new studio album &quot;Return of the Pride&quot; in 2008.

From 2023, Tramp would bring his version of White Lion back with a duo of albums featuring re-recorded versions of White Lion classics, appropriately titled, &quot;The Songs of White Lion&quot;.

==History==
===&quot;Fight to Survive&quot;===
After moving from Denmark to Spain and then New York City, vocalist Mike Tramp (formerly of the bands Mabel, Studs, and Danish Lions) met Staten Island guitarist Vito Bratta (formerly of Dreamer) in late November 1982 at L&#x27;Amour Rock Club in Brooklyn when Tramp was playing with his band. In March 1983 they decided to put together a new band. At first they had a hard time finding a stable rhythm section, and they tried several different ones including Michael Clayton on drums (who later played in the band Tyketto). After a while, they recruited drummer Nicki Capozzi and bassist Felix Robinson (formerly of Angel) and named the group White Lion.

White Lion was signed by Elektra Records in 1984, and recorded their debut album &quot;Fight to Survive&quot;. Elektra was unhappy with the final recording, and after refusing to release the album, terminated the band&#x27;s contract.

The album &quot;Fight to Survive&quot; was eventually released by Victor Company of Japan, Ltd, (JVC Records) in Japan in 1985. Philadelphia-based Grand Slamm Records bought the album from Elektra and released it in America the following year, under license by Elektra/Asylum Records. Fight to Survive charted at number 151 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and featured the band&#x27;s debut single and music video, &quot;Broken Heart.&quot; A few months after the album&#x27;s release, Grand Slamm Records went bankrupt.

Felix Robinson had departed the band after they were dropped by Elektra in 1984. He was eventually replaced by bassist Dave Spitz (brother of Anthrax guitarist Dan Spitz). With the Tramp, Bratta, Capozzi, Spitz lineup, the band recorded a round of demos for their second album, and continued to play shows in New York while shopping around for a new record deal. This incarnation of White Lion was hired to play a fictional band in the Tom Hanks/Shelley Long movie &quot;The Money Pit&quot;, which was released a year later. The soundtrack features the song &quot;Web of Desire&quot; (credited to &quot;White Lion and Robey (portrayed by Louise Robey)), which was demoed that year. The film soundtrack was never officially released, although the song plays in the movie during both of the band&#x27;s scenes. Nicki Capozzi was subsequently fired due to health issues and was in September 1985 replaced by former Anthrax drummer Greg D&#x27;Angelo.

Dave Spitz left at the beginning of 1986 to join Black Sabbath, and was briefly replaced by Bruno Ravel, who left shortly afterwards because he was not allowed to contribute ideas. In March 1986, James LoMenzo was asked to join, and then the band finally was complete.

===&quot;Pride&quot;===
Early in 1987, the band was signed by Atlantic Records. The recording of the new LP took six weeks and on June 21, 1987, their album &quot;Pride&quot; was released. The first single, &quot;Wait&quot;, was released on June 1, 1987, but did not reach the charts for nearly seven months.

The &quot;Pride&quot; tour started in July 1987 as White Lion opened for Frehley&#x27;s Comet. The next year and a half was filled with constant touring, opening for such bands as Aerosmith, Stryper and Kiss. In January 1988, White Lion landed the opening slot for AC/DC on their &quot;Blow Up Your Video&quot; album American tour.

While the band toured with AC/DC, the &quot;Pride&quot; album and &quot;Wait&quot; single finally charted, due in no small part to MTV airing the &quot;Wait&quot; music video in regular rotation—nearly seven months after the single&#x27;s release. &quot;Wait&quot; hit no. 8 on the singles chart, while &quot;Pride&quot; hit no. 11 on the album charts. &quot;Pride&quot; would remain on the Top 200 &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts for a full year, selling two million copies in the US alone and achieving double platinum status.

In August 1988, the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Tell Me&quot;, reached no. 58. Around the time this single was released, White Lion played at the Ritz club in New York City. The show was filmed and later aired on MTV.

The &quot;Pride&quot; album&#x27;s third single, a power ballad titled &quot;When the Children Cry&quot;, made it to no. 3 on the US charts with heavy MTV airplay.

The success of &quot;When the Children Cry&quot; would eventually push sales of &quot;Pride&quot; over the two million mark. In addition, Vito Bratta was recognized for his instrumental talents by racking up Best New Guitarist awards with both &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine and &quot;Guitar for the Practicing Musician&quot; magazine. &quot;All You Need Is Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; was the final single released from the album.

In the end of 1988, the &quot;Pride&quot; tour finally ended, and the band released their first video albums titled &quot;Live at the Ritz&quot; and &quot;One Night in Tokyo&quot; both of which featuring full concerts on VHS.

The band then immediately began work on their next album.

===&quot;Big Game &amp; Mane Attraction&quot;===
In August 1989, White Lion released their third album, &quot;Big Game&quot;, a musically eclectic follow-up to &quot;Pride&quot; that featured the single &quot;Little Fighter&quot; (which peaked at No. 52), in Memory of The &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;, a Greenpeace boat which was destroyed by the French.
A cover of Golden Earring&#x27;s &quot;Radar Love&quot; (which peaked at No. 59) was released as the second single and &quot;Cry for Freedom&quot;, a political song about apartheid in South Africa was released as the third single. &quot;Going Home Tonight&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s final single. The album quickly went gold, with a peak of No. 19 on the album charts. The band&#x27;s success continued with more constant touring. They did a European tour, including a string of UK arena shows supporting Mötley Crüe with Skid Row, and also played with Ozzy Osbourne and Cinderella.

After less successful gigs in England and mixed reviews of the new album, the band chose to take a few months off after the turn of the year to focus on writing a new album. Just in time for the late autumn of 1990, they entered the classic A&amp;M studios with a new producer. White Lion released their fourth album &quot;Mane Attraction&quot; in March 1991. The album featured the singles &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Come Easy&quot; which peaked at number 24 on the Mainstream Rock Charts, &quot;Lights and Thunder&quot;, which is an eight-minute heavy rock epic with a complex structure inspired by Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Achilles Last Stand&quot;, and a re-recorded version of the band&#x27;s debut single &quot;Broken Heart&quot;, all of which featured music videos. &quot;Out with the Boys&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re All I Need&quot; were released as promo singles and &quot;Farewell to You&quot; featured a music video montage. The album also contained White Lion&#x27;s only instrumental song, &quot;Blue Monday&quot;, a tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan, who had died while the band was writing the album. The album&#x27;s two ballads &quot;You&#x27;re All I Need&quot; and &quot;Till Death Do Us Part&quot; gained popular airplay in Indonesia and the Philippines.

Greg D&#x27;Angelo and James LoMenzo left the band in June 1991 when they came back from the European tour, citing &quot;musical differences,&quot; but White Lion carried on with bassist Tommy T-Bone Caradonna and drummer Jimmy DeGrasso (a sideman for Megadeth, Alice Cooper, Suicidal Tendencies, Y&amp;T, and Fiona).

===Breakup===
After briefly touring in support of &quot;Mane Attraction&quot;, Tramp and Bratta decided to fold the group, their last show being held in Boston at the Channel in September 1991. Exactly one year later, in September 1992, the band&#x27;s first compilation album was released, titled &quot;The Best of White Lion&quot;.

Tramp has in later interviews told that the band split up due lack of interests from the record company, issues with the band management and above all the entry of grunge music. 

A video/DVD album featuring concert footage, behind the scenes interviews and all of the band&#x27;s music videos was also released, titled &quot;Escape from Brooklyn&quot;.

When asked what the album would be like if he and Vito Bratta had released another album after &quot;Mane Attraction&quot;, Tramp said it would have hinted at their growth and evolution, and taken them further away from the &#x27;80s sound. He commented:

==After White Lion==
James LoMenzo and Greg D&#x27;Angelo joined Zakk Wylde&#x27;s band, Lynyrd Skynhead, in the mid-1990s which became the band Pride &amp; Glory when Greg D&#x27;Angelo was replaced by Brian Tichy. Pride &amp; Glory released one album, then James LoMenzo left the band. James went on to record and tour with ex-Van Halen frontman David Lee Roth, Zakk Wylde&#x27;s band Black Label Society, thrash metal pioneers Megadeth, and in 2013, joined John Fogerty&#x27;s solo band.

Vito Bratta stayed briefly with Atlantic Records to help produce an album for CPR, and later tried to form a new music group that never panned out. Despite a dedicated worldwide following of guitar aficionados, Vito disappeared from public view from 1992 until his interview by Eddie Trunk live on February 16, 2007. Vito is the sole owner of the White Lion music catalog, retaining the legal and distributive rights to all four original albums. The material was licensed entirely to Bratta&#x27;s Vavoom Music, Inc, when Tramp sold off his share in the mid-1990s.

===Freak of Nature===

Mike Tramp went on to form the alt-rock / heavy metal band Freak of Nature, The follow-up was significantly heavier and darker than White Lion, featuring two guitar players and more visceral songs with a strong rhythmic foundation. The band released three albums between 1992 and 1998, &quot;Freak of Nature&quot;, &quot;Gathering of Freaks&quot;, and &quot;Outcasts&quot;. The band shared stages with Helloween and Dio in Europe in 1993. Freak of Nature eventually disbanded in 1996. Tramp has often called Freak of Nature the best band he has been a part of and also said that he wanted to stray from the 80s sound.

===Mike Tramp solo career===
Following Freak of Nature, Tramp began a solo career, releasing his debut album as a solo artist in 1998 titled &quot;Capricorn&quot;. The album featured former Freak of Nature bandmates, guitarist Kenny Korade and bass player Jerry Best. Former White Lion bass guitarist James LoMenzo performed backing vocals on the album.
The song &quot;Better Off&quot; was released as Tramp&#x27;s debut solo single and features his first solo music video. The album also features the singles &quot;Already Gone&quot;, &quot;If I Live Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Take a Little Time&quot;.

It would be five years before Tramp returned to the studio to record his follow-up album, &quot;Recovering the Wasted Years&quot;, during which time he would move to Australia, with the aim of raising his son away from the rigors of big city life and to plan his next career move. &quot;Recovering the Wasted Years&quot; was released in 2002 and featured the singles &quot;Living a Lie&quot; and &quot;Endless Highway&quot; both featuring live music videos.

In 2003, Tramp followed-up with his third album, &quot;More to Life Than This&quot;, which Tramp once again produced himself but relied on producer/engineer Flemming Rasmussen (Metallica) to engineer and mix the sessions in his very own Sweet Silence Studios. The album&#x27;s title track, &quot;More to Life Than This&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Want to Say Good Night&quot; were both released as singles. A music video made in Australia was released for the song &quot;Lay Down My Life For You&quot;.
Also in 2003, Tramp released the double disc live album &quot;Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Alive&quot;, which features Tramp performing live versions of songs from White Lion, Freak of Nature, and his solo albums.
In 2004, Tramp released the solo album &quot;Songs I Left Behind&quot;.

==The new White Lion and legal issues==
In 1999 after commencing his solo career, Mike Tramp, with all new musicians, also released &quot;Remembering White Lion&quot;, which featured new versions of some of White Lion&#x27;s classic songs and started what would be a long battle to reform White Lion.

In 2000, momentum for a new White Lion continued with the release of a second best of album titled &quot;White Lion Hits&quot; followed by an updated White Lion compilation titled &quot;The Essential White Lion&quot;.

In October 2003, Tramp announced a White Lion reunion, without confirmation of who the lineup would be. Later Tramp said that Vito Bratta wanted nothing to do with a reunion. With summer festivals in Europe already booked, Tramp attempted to put together a &quot;new White Lion&quot; featuring former members James LoMenzo and Jimmy DeGrasso, along with Warren DeMartini of Ratt. Vito Bratta filed suit claiming partial ownership of the name, and the tour was scrapped. Tramp later commented that despite his willingness, &quot;There will never be an original White Lion reunion&quot;.

In 2004 due to legal issues, the album &quot;Remembering White Lion&quot; was re-released under the new title &quot;Last Roar&quot; featuring the band name Tramp&#x27;s White Lion.

In late 2004, Mike Tramp organized another group of unknown musicians and continued with a new White Lion under the act &quot;Tramp&#x27;s White Lion&quot; (TWL),
this however did not stop the persistent legal issues with former members. Despite all the issues, TWL (a.k.a. White Lion 2) played and re-recorded White Lion songs, touring and releasing a box set titled &quot;The Bootleg Series&quot; in 2004 and a double-live CD entitled &quot;Rocking the USA&quot; in 2005.

The band had several concerts canceled in late 2005 as promoters backed away due to the threat of possible legal action and by the end of the year Tramp had almost completely given up on White Lion, but six months later was inspired to continue with the booking of a European tour for November and December 2006. Tramp&#x27;s White Lion played several dates in Europe including Sweden, Norway, Spain, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark.

In 2005, a &quot;Concert Anthology&quot; DVD was released followed by the album &quot;Anthology&quot; in 2006 featuring never before released songs and demo versions of White Lion classic songs from previous albums.

On February 16, 2007, Vito Bratta appeared on the Eddie Trunk radio show in New York, stating that despite what Mike Tramp said, he had never refused a White Lion reunion, stating that the only reason he was unable to participate was due to the illness of his father. He added that he would still be open to the idea and has not closed the door to returning to the music industry again. Trunk made it clear that Bratta&#x27;s involvement in the show was something that he had wanted to happen since White Lion first broke up in 1991. Bratta took calls and answered questions from fans for almost three hours. On April 6 and 7, 2007, at the L&#x27;Amours Reunion Shows in New York, Bratta made his first public musical appearances in over 15 years.

Three weeks later Mike Tramp called the same show from Australia, speaking about Bratta and the band&#x27;s new album, including the tour dates that Tramp&#x27;s White Lion had recently confirmed. Tramp said that he was thankful that Bratta had finally answered fans&#x27; questions, the same questions he himself had been asked many times over the past 15 years. He also stated that he felt uncomfortable answering on Vito&#x27;s behalf, and that he was upset that Vito had withdrawn himself from the music industry.

==&quot;Return of the Pride&quot;==
A White Lion compilation &quot;The Definitive Rock Collection&quot; was released in 2007 and the band was set for a summer tour with Poison and Ratt only to be dropped by the tour promoter after ex-White Lion guitarist Vito Bratta threatened to take legal action over the band name.

In response to the rumors surrounding the White Lion and Poison/Ratt summer tour, Tramp issued a statement explaining that tour promoters Live Nation&#x27;s decision was not based on any controversy over whether Mike Tramp has the legal right to perform as White Lion. Live Nation&#x27;s decision was based upon the threatened lawsuit by Vito Bratta. Even though Live Nation believed Bratta&#x27;s lawsuit to be frivolous and had confirmed that Mike Tramp has the legal right to perform as White Lion, they did not want to spend &#x27;one dollar&#x27; on litigation. Faced with the cancellation of a tour that was to begin within weeks, the band&#x27;s attorneys negotiated a deal with Vito Bratta to drop his threatened lawsuit. However, even with the threat of litigation eliminated, Live Nation did not reinstate White Lion onto the tour. Extremely upset with the decision, Tramp acknowledged the many fans across the United States who were also disappointed by Live Nation&#x27;s decision.

Despite the threatened legal action and the band&#x27;s removal from the Poison/Ratt tour, White Lion continued touring and fulfilled their many headline shows in the U.S. that were scheduled between the Poison shows, including the Rocklahoma festival with Poison, Ratt, Quiet Riot, Slaughter, Y&amp;T, Gypsy Pistoleros, Dirty Penny, Greg Leon Invasion and Zendozer. Tramp also confirmed to MelodicRock.com that the band had just finished recording its new studio album and the CD would be mixed by Dennis Ward and titled &quot;Return of the Pride&quot;.
The new studio album entitled &quot;Return of the Pride&quot; was released on March 14, 2008, and the band was now once again simply known as White Lion. The band did a world tour to support the album. White Lion toured India and played to 42,000 at Shillong, Meghalaya, and a 30,000 plus crowd at the Dimapur stadium in Nagaland. The band was invited to India by the head of the Tripura Royal Family Maharaja Kirit Pradyot Deb Burman. The album featured the singles &quot;Dream&quot; and &quot;Live Your Life&quot;.

A live DVD was released on December 5, 2008, entitled &quot;Bang Your Head Festival 2005&quot;.

==White Lion: final activities and Songs of White Lion==
Following the release of &quot;Return of the Pride&quot;, Tramp faced a tumultuous time of professional indecision as he tried to decide between continuing his solo career or pouring his energy into White Lion.

With White Lion ultimately put on hold again, Tramp continued with his solo career and in 2013 announced in several interviews that there would no longer be a White Lion of any kind, including the new White Lion or any possible reunions. In 2014, Tramp once again confirmed there would be no more White Lion.

In 2023 Mike Tramp announced bringing his version of White Lion back with the upcoming release of ‘Songs of White Lion’, via Frontiers Music Srl on April 14, 2023. 
As the title implies, the new album sees Tramp re-imagining select cuts from White Lion&#x27;s catalog. A re-recorded &quot;Cry for Freedom&quot; was released as the first single, followed by a reworked take on &quot;Little Fighter&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In August 2024, &quot;Songs of White Lion Volume 2&quot; was released, featuring Tramp re-imagining ten more select cuts from White Lion&#x27;s catalog
Volume 2 includes the new single and music video for the re recorded &quot;Lights and Thunder&quot; and the reworked &quot;Lonely Nights&quot;, &quot;Out With the Boys&quot;, &quot;The Road to Valhalla&quot; and &quot;Till Death Do Us Part&quot; were also released as singles featuring visualizer music videos. Tramp will embark on an extended tour supporting &quot;Songs of White Lion Volume 2&quot; starting in mid-August 2024 with European and US dates, followed by Australia in 2025.

The song &quot;Little Fighter&quot; was about the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;, a ship owned by the environmental group Greenpeace that was destroyed by the French government.

<text>Agricultural economics is an applied field of economics concerned with the application of economic theory in optimizing the production and distribution of food and fiber products. 
Agricultural economics began as a branch of economics that specifically dealt with land usage. It focused on maximizing the crop yield while maintaining a good soil ecosystem. Throughout the 20th century the discipline expanded and the current scope of the discipline is much broader. Agricultural economics today includes a variety of applied areas, having considerable overlap with conventional economics. Agricultural economists have made substantial contributions to research in economics, econometrics, development economics, and environmental economics. Agricultural economics influences food policy, agricultural policy, and environmental policy.

==Origins==

Economics has been defined as the study of resource allocation under scarcity. Agricultural economics, or the application of economic methods to optimize the decisions made by agricultural producers, grew to prominence around the turn of the 20th century. The field of agricultural economics can be traced back to works on land economics. Henry Charles Taylor was the greatest contributor in this period, with the establishment of the Department of Agricultural Economics at the University of Wisconsin in 1909.

Another contributor, 1979 Nobel Economics Prize winner Theodore Schultz, was among the first to examine development economics as a problem related directly to agriculture. Schultz was also instrumental in establishing econometrics as a tool for use in analyzing agricultural economics empirically; he noted in his landmark 1956 article that agricultural supply analysis is rooted in &quot;shifting sand&quot;, implying that it was and is simply not being done correctly.

One scholar in the field, Ford Runge, summarizes the development of agricultural economics as follows:

Agricultural economics arose in the late 19th century, combined the theory of the firm with marketing and organization theory, and developed throughout the 20th century largely as an empirical branch of general economics. The discipline was closely linked to empirical applications of mathematical statistics and made early and significant contributions to econometric methods. In the 1960s and afterwards, as agricultural sectors in the OECD countries contracted, agricultural economists were drawn to the development problems of poor countries, to the trade and macroeconomic policy implications of agriculture in rich countries, and to a variety of production, consumption, and environmental and resource problems.

Agricultural economists have made many well-known contributions to the economics field with such models as the cobweb model, hedonic regression pricing models, new technology and diffusion models (Zvi Griliches), multifactor productivity and efficiency theory and measurement, and the random coefficients regression. The farm sector is frequently cited as a prime example of the perfect competition economic paradigm.

In Asia, the Faculty of Agricultural Economics was established in September 1919 in Hokkaido Imperial University, Japan, as Tokyo Imperial University&#x27;s School of Agriculture started a faculty on agricultural economics in its second department of agricultural science. 

In the Philippines, agricultural economics was offered first by the University of the Philippines Los Baños Department of Agricultural Economics in 1919. Today, the field of agricultural economics has transformed into a more integrative discipline which covers farm management and production economics, rural finance and institutions, agricultural marketing and prices, agricultural policy and development, food and nutrition economics, and environmental and natural resource economics.

Since the 1970s, agricultural economics has primarily focused on seven main topics, according to Ford Runge: agricultural environment and resources; risk and uncertainty; food and consumer economics; prices and incomes; market structures; trade and development; and technical change and human capital.

==Major topics in agricultural economics==

===Agricultural environment and natural resources===
In the field of environmental economics, agricultural economists have contributed in three main areas: designing incentives to control environmental externalities (such as water pollution due to agricultural production), estimating the value of non-market benefits from natural resources and environmental amenities (such as an appealing rural landscape), and the complex interrelationship between economic activities and environmental consequences. With regard to natural resources, agricultural economists have developed quantitative tools for improving land management, preventing erosion, managing pests, protecting biodiversity, and preventing livestock diseases.

===Food and consumer economics===
While at one time, the field of agricultural economics was focused primarily on farm-level issues, in recent years agricultural economists have studied diverse topics related to the economics of food consumption. In addition to economists&#x27; long-standing emphasis on the effects of prices and incomes, researchers in this field have studied how information and quality attributes influence consumer behavior. Agricultural economists have contributed to understanding how households make choices between purchasing food or preparing it at home, how food prices are determined, definitions of poverty thresholds, how consumers respond to price and income changes in a consistent way, and survey and experimental tools for understanding consumer preferences.

===Production economics and farm management===
Agricultural economics research has addressed diminishing returns in agricultural production, as well as farmers&#x27; costs and supply responses. Much research has applied economic theory to farm-level decisions. Studies of risk and decision-making under uncertainty have real-world applications to crop insurance policies and to understanding how farmers in developing countries make choices about technology adoption. These topics are important for understanding prospects for producing sufficient food for a growing world population, subject to new resource and environmental challenges such as water scarcity and global climate change.

===Development economics===
Development economics is broadly concerned with the improvement of living conditions in low-income countries, and the improvement of economic performance in low-income settings. Because agriculture is a large part of most developing economies, both in terms of employment and share of GDP, agricultural economists have been at the forefront of empirical research on development economics, contributing to our understanding of agriculture&#x27;s role in economic development, economic growth and structural transformation. Many agricultural economists are interested in the food systems of developing economies, the linkages between agriculture and nutrition, and the ways in which agriculture interact with other domains, such as the natural environment.

==Professional associations==

The International Association of Agricultural Economists (IAAE) is a worldwide professional association, which holds its major conference every three years. The association publishes the journal &quot;Agricultural Economics&quot;. There also is a European Association of Agricultural Economists (EAAE), an African Association of Agricultural Economists (AAAE) and an Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society. Substantial work in agricultural economics internationally is conducted by the International Food Policy Research Institute.

In the United States, the primary professional association is the Agricultural &amp; Applied Economics Association (AAEA), which holds its own annual conference and also co-sponsors the annual meetings of the Allied Social Sciences Association (ASSA). The AAEA publishes the &quot;American Journal of Agricultural Economics&quot; and &quot;Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy&quot;.

==Careers in agricultural economics==

Graduates from agricultural and applied economics departments find jobs in many sectors of the economy: agricultural management, agribusiness, agricultural marketing, education, the financial sector, government, natural resource and environmental management, real estate, and public relations. Careers in agricultural economics require at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and research careers in the field require graduate-level training; 
see Masters in Agricultural Economics.
A 2011 study by the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce rated agricultural economics tied for 8th out of 171 fields in terms of employability.

<text>Elaine Pagels, née Hiesey (born February 13, 1943), is an American historian of religion. She is the Harrington Spear Paine Professor of Religion at Princeton University. Pagels has conducted extensive research into early Christianity and Gnosticism.

Her best-selling book &quot;The Gnostic Gospels&quot; (1979) examines the divisions in the early Christian church, and the way that women have been viewed throughout Jewish history and Christian history. Modern Library named it as one of the 100 best books of the twentieth century.

==Early life and education==
Elaine Hiesey was born February 13, 1943, in California. She is the daughter of Stanford University botanist William Hiesey.

According to Pagels, she has been fascinated with the Gospel of John since her youth. She found it to be &quot;the most spiritual of the four gospels&quot;. After joining an Evangelical church at the age of 13, she quit when the church announced that a Jewish friend of hers who had been killed in a car crash would go to hell because he had not been &quot;born again&quot;.

Pagels remained fascinated by the power of the New Testament. She started to learn Greek when she entered college, and read the Gospels in their original language. She graduated from Stanford University, earning a BA in 1964 and MA in 1965. After briefly studying dance at Martha Graham&#x27;s studio, she began studying for a PhD in religion at Harvard University as a student of Helmut Koester and part of a team studying the Nag Hammadi library manuscripts.

== Academic work ==
Pagels completed her PhD in 1970, and joined the faculty at Barnard College. She headed its Department of Religion from 1974 until she moved to Princeton in 1982. In 1975, after studying the Pauline Epistles and comparing them to Gnosticism and the early Church, Pagels wrote the book, &quot;The Gnostic Paul&quot; which argues that Paul the Apostle was a source for Gnosticism and hypothesizes that Paul&#x27;s influence on the direction of the early Christian church was great enough to inspire the creation of pseudonymous writings such as the Pastoral Epistles (First and Second Timothy and Titus), in order to make it appear that Paul was anti-Gnostic.

Pagels&#x27; study of the Nag Hammadi manuscripts was the basis for &quot;The Gnostic Gospels&quot; (1979), a popular introduction to the Nag Hammadi library. It was a best seller and won both the National Book Award in one-year category Religion/Inspiration
and the National Book Critics Circle Award. Modern Library named it one of the 100 best books of the twentieth century. She follows the well-known thesis that Walter Bauer first put forth in 1934 and argues that the Christian church was founded in a society espousing contradictory viewpoints. A review of the book in the UK newspaper, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, led to the UK broadcaster, Channel 4, commissioning a major three-part series inspired by it, called &quot;&quot;. The programme triggered a national furore, and marked a significant moment in the changes that religious broadcasting was already undergoing at that time. As a movement Gnosticism was not coherent and there were several areas of disagreement among the different factions. According to Pagels&#x27;s interpretation of an era different from ours, Gnosticism &quot;attracted women because it allowed female participation in sacred rites&quot;.

In 1982, Pagels joined Princeton University as a professor of early Christian history. Aided by a MacArthur Fellowship grant in 1981, she researched and wrote &quot;Adam, Eve, and the Serpent&quot;, which examines the creation account and its role in the development of sexual attitudes in the Christian West. In both &quot;The Gnostic Gospels&quot; and &quot;Adam, Eve, and the Serpent&quot;, Pagels focuses especially on the way that women have been viewed throughout Jewish and Christian history. Her other books include &quot;The Origin of Satan&quot; (1995), &quot;Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas&quot; (2003), &quot;Reading Judas: The Gospel of Judas and the Shaping of Christianity&quot; (2007), and &quot;Revelations: Visions, Prophecy, and Politics in the Book of Revelation&quot; (2012).

In April 1987, Pagels&#x27;s son Mark died after five years of illness, and in July 1988, her husband Heinz Pagels died in a mountain climbing accident. These personal tragedies deepened her spiritual awareness and afterwards Pagels began research leading to &quot;The Origin of Satan&quot;. This book argues that the figure of Satan became a way for Christians to demonize their religious and cultural opponents, namely, pagans, other Christian sects, and Jews.

Her &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller, &quot;Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas&quot; (2003), contrasts the Gospel of Thomas with the Gospel of John. It argues that a close reading of the texts reveals distinct theological perspectives: the Gospel of Thomas teaches that &quot;there is a light within each person, and it lights up the whole universe... If it does not shine, there is darkness,&quot; emphasizing the divine light within all human beings. In contrast, the Gospel of John presents Jesus Christ as the &quot;light of the world,&quot; centralizing the revelation of God through Christ.

Pagels suggests that Gospel of Thomas, along with other non-canonical texts, portrays Jesus not as God, but as a human teacher uncovering the divine light within individuals. This interpretation conflicts with the canonical New Testament gospels, which affirm the divinity of Jesus. Pagels argues that the Gospel of John was written in response to the non-canonical viewpoints found in the Gospel of Thomas. She supports this by noting that in John&#x27;s Gospel, the apostle Thomas is portrayed as a disciple who struggles with doubt, needing physical proof to believe, while John emphasizes the divine nature of Jesus as central to faith—a key aspect of early Christian orthodoxy. 

&quot;Beyond Belief&quot; also includes Pagel&#x27;s personal reflection on faith, particularly during a period of personal loss and tragedy.

In 2012, Pagels received Princeton University&#x27;s Howard T. Behrman Award for Distinguished Achievement in the Humanities for, as one nominator wrote, &quot;her ability to show readers that the ancient texts she studies are concerned with the great questions of human existence though they may discuss them in mythological or theological language very different from our own.&quot; In 2015, Pagels was given the National Humanities Medal.

==Reviews==
Pagels and other scholars contend that the Gospel of John exposes the gnosticism advanced by the Gospel of Thomas, which was ultimately rejected by church authorities and excluded from the canon. Other scholars have contested this position. For example, Larry Hurtado argues that John portrays Thomas as no worse than Peter in John 21:15-23, where Jesus asks a disconcerted Peter whether he really loves him and later admonishes him. As well, Hurtado notes that Thomas&#x27;s insistence, in the post-resurrection accounts, on seeing Jesus before he&#x27;ll believe he has risen from the dead is answered positively by Jesus and that Thomas is not represented polemically but as coming to faith.

==Personal life==
She married theoretical physicist Heinz Pagels in 1969, with whom she had a son and adopted two children. In April 1987, their son Mark died at age six and a half, followed 15 months later by the death of her husband in a climbing accident.

Pagels married law professor Kent Greenawalt from Columbia University in June 1995. Each had been widowed about six years earlier, left with children. She had a son and a daughter, while Greenawalt had three sons.

<doc id="733143" wikidata="Q1657380" url="?curid=733143" title="PALplus">
<text>PALplus (or &quot;PAL+&quot;) is an analogue television broadcasting system aimed to improve and enhance the PAL format by allowing 16:9 (or 1.77:1) aspect ratio broadcasts, while remaining compatible with existing television receivers, defined by International Telecommunication Union (ITU) recommendation BT.1197-1. Introduced in 1993, it followed experiences with the HD-MAC (high definition) and D2-MAC, hybrid analogue-digital widescreen formats that were incompatible with PAL receivers. It was developed at the University of Dortmund in Germany, in cooperation with German terrestrial broadcasters and European and Japanese manufacturers. The system had some adoption across Europe during the late 1990s and helped introduce widescreen TVs in the market, but never became mainstream. 

A similar system, developed in Japan at the same time and named EDTV-II/ Wide-aspect Clear-vision, allows for 16:9 NTSC broadcasts.

== History ==
The MAC family of standards was adopted in Europe in 1983, primarily for Direct Broadcasting by Satellite (DBS) services. This was an evolution from older color TV systems (such as PAL or SECAM) fixing the problems of interference between luminance and chrominance, and providing a stepping stone for a future HDTV system. In 1986, a new high definition broadcasting standard, HD-MAC, was presented, offering twice the number of scanning lines compared to PAL. A transitional standard, D2-MAC was established. It had the same number of lines as PAL, but like HD-MAC it was designed for 16:9 widescreen content. 

In 1989, the PALplus strategy group was founded. The goal was to develop an enhanced system for terrestrial transmission compatible with PAL. European terrestrial broadcasters felt the need to better position themselves in order to compete with satellite and cable operators, in view of the introduction of MAC widescreen broadcasts. While not attempting to produce HDTV standards of quality, the new format was meant to improve PAL in the following areas:

* Wider aspect ratio, but with acceptable effects on the traditional 4:3 (or 1.33:1) screen
* Reduced level of artefacts, such as cross-color
* Better sound system
* Improved resolution
* Compatibility with existing receivers.

In the beginning, the task group consisted of the public broadcasting corporations of Germany (ARD and ZDF), Austria (ORF), Switzerland (SRG) and the United Kingdom (BBC and UKIB, United Kingdom Independent Broadcasters) together with the consumer electronics manufacturers Grundig, Nokia, Philips and Thomson. Sony as well as the Spanish (RTVE) and Portuguese (RTP) broadcasters joined the group later on.

At the Berlin IFA 1991, a first PALplus test transmission was demonstrated

At the Berlin IFA 1993, the first experimental PALplus broadcasts began. In the same year, the European Union approved a plan to support the production and broadcast of 16:9 programs.

In 1994, broadcasters began adopting the format. In the United Kingdom, Channel 4 starts to broadcast using the system in October. Nokia launched the first PALplus TV set in Germany.

In 1995, the International Telecommunication Union publishes recommendation BT.1197-1, defining the PALplus system. Originally, the PALplus consortium included the following manufacturers: Philips, Grundig, Thomson, Nokia and Sony. One of the four big Korean electronics manufacturers, Samsung, joined the PALplus consortium that year. VCR manufacturers associated with the PALplus consortium were expected to launch updated VHS and S-VHS home recorders soon. The cost increment compared to conventional PAL VCRs was expected to be small. PALplus was one of the highlights of the Berlin IFA 1995 edition.

In January 1996, the PALplus board published the specifications of the standard in order to support the further dissemination of this standard for wide-screen transmissions. After German broadcasters started to broadcast some of their programmes using the format, the board ended its work by the end of that same year.

At the beginning of 1998, PALplus programmes were broadcast on a regular basis in nine European countries, which made PALplus the mostly used standard for widescreen transmissions in Europe at that time. Evaluations, performed by ITU and EBU engineers in 1995-1998 concluded that the use of down-converted HDTV source material, as well as high-quality widescreen standard definition content, could be a significant benefit to the PALplus picture quality. Moreover, the experts felt that PALplus would not be out of place in an HDTV environment at viewing distances equal or farther to four heights of a television set. It was presumed that the standard method of display of a PALplus signal would be in 625-line interlaced (50 Hz) form, although other display formats (for example, 50 Hz progressive, 100 Hz interlace, or 100 Hz progressive) could be receiver options.

== Countries and territories that used PALplus ==

The following countries and territories used the PALplus system:
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 

=== Belgium ===
In Belgium, the Flemish public broadcasting service VRT had a policy that all of its self-created TV programmes are broadcast in PALplus. The commercial TV station VTM used to broadcast a lot in PALplus. Even the third broadcasting organisation SBS Belgium with its stations VT4 and VijfTV used to broadcast in PALplus for all of their new productions.

The Walloon public broadcasting service RTBF used to broadcast 16:9 programmes that it purchased in PALplus, but preferred creating their own programmes in 4:3. Walloon commercial TV station RTL-TVI used to broadcast almost all its shows in PALPlus.

In 2010, Belgium switched off analog television broadcast.

=== Finland ===
In Finland, the commercial broadcaster MTV3 started broadcasting the youth music program &quot;Jyrki&quot; in PALplus format on August 18, 1997. The experiment ended when the program ended some four years later.

In 2007, Finland switched off analog television broadcast.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, all public broadcasters (ARD, ZDF, &quot;etc.&quot;) complied with this standard. However, private broadcasters (RTL, ProSieben, &quot;etc&quot;) have shown no interest in either this standard or in the 16:9 format.

Pay-per-view channels such as those on Sky often broadcast in 16:9, but use a different standard that requires another kind of decoder.

In 2008, Germany began switching off analog television broadcast.

=== Greece ===
In Greece, there were sporadic PALplus broadcasts on the national television (E.R.T. - Hellenic Radio Television). Throughout the &#x27;90s several attempts from commercial broadcasters in adopting the system failed due to lack of popularity.

As some of the repeaters of ERT&#x27;s channels were fed via OTE (Greek public telecom provider) in uncompressed form over terrestrial links, and others via NOVA (Greece&#x27;s only satellite platform) using MPEG encoding, Palplus wasn&#x27;t available on all areas. The heavy MPEG encoding on NOVA degraded WSS signaling and the additional information embedded in PALplus, making it undecodable.

=== Italy ===
It was used by broadcasters such as RAI (Italy).

=== Ireland ===
RTÉ Ireland’s public service broadcaster, began to broadcast widescreen programming in 1995, initially on Network 2 Television in a special slot, mostly focused on documentaries, music and feature films, but over time more widescreen programming was introduced.

=== Netherlands ===
In the Netherlands, the public broadcasters used PALplus up to 2005. With the switch to digital television and anamorphic widescreen, the system was discontinued with the end of terrestrial analogue broadcasts in November 2006. Analog broadcasts continued on cable operations, but PALplus wasn&#x27;t used for down conversion on those services.

=== Poland ===
In Poland, the only documented use of PALplus is by TV Polonia on December 31, 1996.

=== Portugal ===
In Portugal, the private broadcaster TVI began broadcasting movies in PALplus in 1994, but some years after it left the standard behind.

The public broadcaster RTP started using the format on December 5, 1997.

The system was used to broadcast selected programs (about five programs each day) and some widescreen movies on analog terrestrial broadcasts. Cable distributors occasionally strip the signal of the WSS bits, rendering the system inoperative. Also, when Digital Terrestrial Television broadcasts started, there was no dedicated anamorphic simulcast for the digital channels. Therefore, PALPlus over terrestrial analog PAL broadcasts remained the only source of 576 lines widescreen TV in Portugal for many years.

Since the middle of 2010 PALplus was dropped in favor of regular 16:9 letterbox, because the system caused considerable image degradation (with an effective horizontal resolution of only about ~400px compared to 720px of a digital SDTV image) when used on digital transmissions without any decoding.

With the end of analog broadcasts by 2012, the system became officially obsolete.

=== Spain ===
In Spain, the system was used by the public broadcaster RTVE. The Catalan public television, TV3, trialed the PALplus format in 1994, with a weekly broadcast of a film in this format. Other public regional stations (like Galicia&#x27;s CRTVG) tested the format too, but after these trials the technology was dropped and 16:9 digital broadcasts were not introduced until 2007.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, Channel 4 adopted the system to broadcast selected films after October 1994. Some programmes, including &quot;Fifteen to One&quot; and the omnibus edition of &quot;Brookside&quot; were also broadcast this way. BBC didn&#x27;t adopt the system, opting instead for digital widescreen broadcasts. All of the six main broadcasters, BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Five, Sky and Virgin Media, now broadcast in digital.

Analog television broadcast was switched off in the United Kingdom in 2012.

== Operation ==
A standard PAL receiver will display the 16:9 image in letterbox format with 432 active lines. This reproduces noticeably less detail than the 576 lines used for 4:3 broadcasts. A PALplus receiver can use extra information hidden in the black bars above and below the image to fully recover the 576 lines of vertical resolution.

For compatibility reasons, the horizontal bandwidth remains at 5.0 MHz. This means that a PALplus signal provides no extra horizontal resolution to compensate for the image being stretched across a wider screen. The result is a horizontal resolution that is 73% of the vertical resolution, or 51% when the Kell factor is ignored.

A special signal tells the receiver when PALplus is in use, and also whether the original content was interlaced (&quot;Camera mode&quot; or 50i) or progressive scanned (&quot;Film mode&quot; or 25p) - see List of broadcast video formats. An additional signal can enable a &quot;Ghost Cancellation&quot; feature.

A separate feature related to PALplus is ColourPlus, which improves colour decoding performance.

=== Extensions ===
The PALplus standard comprises three extensions to standard PAL:

==== Vertical helper ====
A broadcaster creates a PALplus signal by scaling an anamorphic 16:9 picture with 576 lines down to 432 lines, so that the picture appears letterboxed on a regular PAL TV set. For luminance, the scaling is done using a pair of matching low-pass and high-pass filters, with the low-pass result being the regular PAL compatible letterbox broadcast. One out of every 4 lines of the high-pass result is hidden in the remaining 144 black letterbox lines at the top and bottom of the picture, using the U colour subcarrier. The filtering is such that this is enough to restore the complete 576 line resolution. The use of the colour subcarrier means these signals appear as very dark blue and yellow patterns on black bars on a regular 4:3 PAL TV set.

The 16:9 PAL-plus receiver combines 432 normally visible lines plus 144 helper lines, restoring the original 576 lines. In &quot;Film mode&quot; (progressive scan), this operation is performed on a per-frame basis, while in &quot;Camera mode&quot; (interlaced) the operation is performed per-field.

==== Colour-plus (or Clean PAL) ====
The PAL colour carrier is modulated making use of correlation between 2 fields, in order to give a cleaner luminance/chrominance separation in the PALplus receiver. It is used with signals with high horizontal luminance frequencies (3 MHz) that share the spectrum with the chrominance signals. Colour pictures on both standard and PALplus receivers are enhanced.

For progressive &quot;Film mode&quot; material, &quot;Fixed&quot; Colour-Plus is used, as there is no motion between the image fields.
For camera based images, &quot;Motion Adaptive Color-Plus&quot; (MACP) is used based on movement.

==== Signaling bits ====
A special WSS signal tells the receiver whether 4:3/16:9/PALplus is in use, and also whether the original content was interlaced (&quot;Camera mode&quot;) or progressive scanned (&quot;Film mode&quot;). An additional signal can enable a &quot;Ghost Cancellation&quot; feature. The bandwidth of these bits is low enough to be recorded on VHS and allow the receiver to switch to the proper format.

== PALplus compatible sets ==
The standard permits using the mark &quot;PALplus&quot; if the vertical helper reconstruction is implemented, with Colour-plus being optional.

Some PALPlus compatible sets:

* Grundig: MFW82-710/9, MFW82-720/9, MFW82-730/9 DVD, M82-169/9
* Nokia: Nokia 8297, Nokia 7297, Nokia 6197
* Philips: 28PW9525, 32PW9525, 36PW9525
* Schneider: Scinema 28-100T, Scinema 2810, Scinema 3000
* Sony: KV-W 3213D, KV-32W3(S)

PALPlus set top decoders:

* Nokia 1724
* Philips: 22AV1012, 22AV1401

Most widescreen sets without any PALplus processing will switch the display format automatically between 4:3 and 16:9, based on the WSS signaling bits. These sets will simply zoom the centre 432 lines of the 16:9 letterboxed image to fill all of the 16:9 frame, without recovering any of the extra vertical line resolution.
