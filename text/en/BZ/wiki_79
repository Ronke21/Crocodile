<text>Wilopo (21 October 1909 – 1 June 1981) was an Indonesian politician and lawyer. A capable administrator, he served as prime minister of Indonesia from 1952 to 1953. He also held various other positions during his career, including as Minister of Labor, Minister of Economic Affairs, speaker of the Constitutional Assembly, and chairman of the Supreme Advisory Council.

Born into a Muslim family in Purworejo, Wilopo attended the &quot;Rechts Hogeschool&quot; in Batavia (now Jakarta), during which time he became involved in educational and nationalist groups. After graduating, he worked as a lawyer and was active in the Indonesian nationalist movement, becoming involved in the Partindo and Gerindo political parties. During the Japanese occupation period (1942–1945), Wilopo became an official in the occupation government and was a figure in both the &quot;Putera&quot; and &quot;Suishintai&quot; organizations. Following the proclamation of Indonesian Independence in 1945, Wilopo joined the newly formed Republican government, first as an aide to Jakarta Mayor Suwiryo, and then as a member of the Central Indonesian National Committee. During the Indonesian National Revolution (1945–1949), he joined the Indonesian National Party (PNI) and became Junior Minister of Labor in 1947.

Following the recognition of sovereignty in the Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference, in which he took part, Wilopo was appointed Minister of Labor by Prime Minister Mohammad Hatta in 1949. He also emerged as a leader in the Indonesian National Party (PNI) and became Minister of Economic Affairs in the Soekiman Cabinet. In 1952, following a foreign policy debacle, the Soekiman Cabinet fell and Wilopo was appointed &quot;formateur&quot; of a new cabinet by President Sukarno. He opted to form a new cabinet consisting of pro-Western technocrats with unity, a common policy orientation, and the support of the PNI and Masyumi Party, even though both parties were unenthusiastic partners.

As prime minister, Wilopo presided over a realignment of political forces as the PNI grew increasingly wary of the Masyumi, the Nahdlatul Ulama split off from the Masyumi, and the Communist Party (PKI) re-entered the political scene. His premiership was also marked by a succession of crises, including an economic crisis and a show of force by the Indonesian Army, which opposed his cabinet&#x27;s demobilization scheme, culminating in the downfall of his cabinet over a land dispute in North Sumatra. Afterward, Wilopo continued to serve in public office, serving as speaker of the Constitutional Assembly (1956–1959) and chairman of the Supreme Advisory Council (1968–1978). He died in Jakarta in 1981.

== Early life and education ==
=== Early life ===
Wilopo was born in Purworejo, on October 21, 1909. He was born to a modest family in Central Java. His father was a man named Soedjono Soerodirjo, but he was raised by his uncle, a man known as Mantri Guru Prawirodiharjo. He wouldn&#x27;t know of his real father until he reached adulthood. When he was eight years old, he and his family had to move to Loano which is five kilometers from Purworejo. They returned to Purworejo when he was in sixth grade.

=== Education ===
Wilopo attended the Holland Inlandse School (HIS). He could have continued his education at the Europese Hogere School (ELS), but he didn&#x27;t because he wanted to continue his education at the Opleiding School Voor Inlandsche Ambtenaren (OSVIA). After graduating from HIS, Wilopo continued his education at the Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs (MULO) in Magelang.

After studying at MULO, Wilopo continued his education at Algemene Middelbare School (AMS), in Yogyakarta. At AMS, Wilopo took part in exact sciences and physics. He received a scholarship to make ends meet during his life in Yogyakarta. During his stay in Yogyakarta, he enjoyed reading newsletters of the De Locomotief, Darmo Kondo, and Soeara Oemoem newspapers. Through this, he found the name of Sukarno (future President of Indonesia). Wilopo also joined the Jong Java youth organization around this time.

He continued his education at the Technische Hoge School (THS) in Bandung. There, Wilopo lived in the Prawirosentiko family&#x27;s house. After some illnesses, he moved to Sukabumi, living in his cousin&#x27;s house. There, he became a teacher at the Taman Siswa.

He moved to Jakarta and continued his studies at the Rechts Hoge School (RHS). During this time, he lived at the house of Abdul Rasyid, a friend of his from MULO.

== Political career ==
=== Minister of labour ===
Wilopo&#x27;s first government position was as the junior minister of labour during the First and Second Amir Sjarifuddin Cabinets from 3 July 1947 to 29 January 1948. After a brief hiatus, he became the minister of labour during the Republic of the United States of Indonesia Cabinet from 20 December 1949 to 6 September 1950. He later became the minister of trade and industry during the Sukiman Cabinet.

=== Prime minister of Indonesia ===
After completing his tenure as Minister of Trade and Industry, on 19 March 1952, Wilopo was told to choose a cabinet to lead. Three days after giving his list to President Sukarno, on 1 April he and his cabinet took power; it was essentially a coalition of necessity between the Masyumi and National parties. During his time as prime minister, he also spent 26 days as Foreign Minister, from 3 to 29 April, making him the shortest-serving Indonesian foreign minister as of 2011. As prime minister, he was initially able to draw support from the army by unhesitatingly accepting the Sultan of Yogyakarta Hamengkubuwono IX as defense minister. After fourteen months, the cabinet collapsed; the collapse was blamed on land issues.

=== Post-prime ministership ===
From 1955 to 1959, Wilopo served as the Speaker of the Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia. He later became head of the Commission of Four, a part of the Corruption Eradication Team, with his service beginning in June 1970. Despite finding &quot;corruption everywhere&quot;, no actions were taken by the government.

== Death and legacy ==
Wilopo died in Jakarta in 1981. Herbert Feith, an Australian scholar on Indonesian politics, notes that Wilopo was widely considered fair-minded and sympathetic to the plight of the working classes, working carefully towards his goals. As he did not prioritize party loyalty, he was known as being able to cooperate with anyone.

== Personal life ==
During his time in Jakarta, he met Sumikalimah, the younger sister of Abdul Rasyid&#x27;s mother. Sumikalimah is a teacher at an elementary school. Wilopo began a relationship with Sumikalimah until they got married in October 1917.

<text>The Porsche 961 was a racing car built by Porsche and based on their 959 sports car. It was intended for Group B sports car racing, complementing the purpose-built 956 and 962C which ran Group C in the World Sports-Prototype Championship. The 961 project was short-lived, running only three races and seeing the construction of only one car. Plans to sell the car to customers were scrapped when the Group B class was canceled.

==Development==

In the early 1980s, the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) reorganized their classification structure for motorsports. Two new categories, known as Group B and Group C, were designated for use in the World Sports-Prototype Championship. Porsche had developed the 956 for the Group C rules, and following the 956&#x27;s debut, began work on developing a Group B car. An initial prototype concept, named the Porsche Gruppe B, debuted in 1983, after which plans were made to build the car for production and provide racing versions for customers as had been done with the 956.

By time the Gruppe B had been launched as the production 959 in 1985, Group B rules had been altered by FISA to better suit the class&#x27; use in the World Rally Championship rather than the Sports-Prototype Championship. Plans to develop multiple customer cars for sports car racing were therefore scrapped by Porsche, but development continued on the production of car which could be factory run in order to put the car&#x27;s development to use. This lone racing car, built on 959 chassis No. 10016, became known as the 961.

The new 961 retained much from the 959 road car, including most notably the four-wheel drive system that was uncommon in sports car racing at the time but allowable under the Group B regulations. The system was modified to distribute power more to the rear wheels rather than the balanced distribution of the 959. The driver adjustable damper and suspension systems were removed and replaced by a racing unit that could only be adjusted from by the pit crew, but was more reliable for endurance racing.

The 961&#x27;s engine was a Porsche Type-935 unit. This twin-turbocharged engine was not only used in the 959, but also in the Group C 956 and later the 962C. This racing development helped the 961 run higher boost level than the standard 959. This resulted in a peak power output of . The brakes were also adopted from those developed for the 962C. Bodywork was replaced with lighter panels to bring the car down to a weight of , while the rear wing and front fascia were replaced with modified designs in order to create more downforce. Dunlop, who already supported Porsche&#x27;s factory 962C team, supplied the tyres for the 961.

When the 961 was completed in 1986, Porsche had not yet built enough 959s to satisfy the Group B regulations for homologation. Due to this, the 961 had to be classified under International Motor Sports Association&#x27;s similar GTX class.

==Racing history==
Making its first appearance at the May test for the 1986 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 961 was able to show its potential pace quickly by setting the tenth fastest lap time under the control of French driver René Metge. The 961&#x27;s time was not only quicker than the BMW M1 which was entered in the Group B category, but was also faster than several C1 and C2 class prototypes. At the race in June, Metge was joined by fellow Frenchman Claude Ballot-Léna and the two were able to qualify the car 26th. Through dependability the 961 was able to climb through the field as the race progressed and eventually finished the race in seventh place, 47 laps behind the winning factory 962C.

Later in 1986, the 961 was moved to the United States and entered in the Camel GT Championship&#x27;s final round at Daytona International Speedway. The car was reclassified once again by International Motor Sports Association, this time being entered in the GTP category alongside sports prototypes like the 962. Drivers Kees Nierop of Canada and Günter Steckkönig of Germany were assigned to the car. The 961 however struggled with the banked turns of the Daytona circuit. The 961&#x27;s Dunlop tyres were pushed beyond their limits and suffered several blowouts while the car was at full speed. This slowed the 961&#x27;s overall pace down before it eventually finished the race in 24th position.

Porsche continued to develop the 961 into the 1987 season where it was prepared once more for Le Mans. The car was repainted in the colors of Rothmans to match the scheme used by the factory 962Cs. Performance fell from the previous year as the 961 earned only the 16th fastest lap in the May test session. Swiss driver Claude Haldi was assigned to partner René Metge, but the two were later joined by Kees Nierop whose 962C had been destroyed in a qualifying accident. Although the 961 managed to run as high as 11th overall in the race, Kees Nierop crashed the car after a mis-shift. The car was stopped and retired after it caught fire as Nierop attempted to return to the pit lane.

Following the Le Mans difficulties, and with no championship with which to run the 961 against similar machinery, the project was canceled. The 961, repaired after its crash and fire in 1987, now resides on display in the Porsche Museum in Stuttgart, Germany.

<text>The Porsche 964 is a model of the Porsche 911 sports car manufactured and sold between 1989 and 1994. Designed by Benjamin Dimson through January 1986, it featured significant styling revisions over previous 911 models, most prominently the more integrated bumpers. It was the first car to be offered with Porsche&#x27;s Tiptronic automatic transmission and all wheel drive as options.

==Name==
Type 964 (&quot;nine-sixty-four&quot;, or &quot;nine-six-four&quot;) is Porsche&#x27;s internal code name for the 911 Carrera 2 and 911 Carrera 4 models, which were badged simply as &quot;Carrera 2&quot; and &quot;Carrera 4&quot;. &quot;964&quot; is used by automotive publications and enthusiasts to distinguish them from other generations of the Carrera.

==Carrera 2 and 4==
The 964 was considered to be 85% new as compared to its predecessor, the Carrera 3.2. The first 964s available in 1989 were all wheel drive equipped &quot;Carrera 4&quot; models; Porsche added the rear wheel drive Carrera 2 variant to the range in 1990. Both variants were available as a coupé, Targa or Cabriolet. The 964 Carrera was the last generation sold with the traditional removable Targa roof until the 2011 991 (993, 996, and 997 versions used instead a complex glass-roof &quot;greenhouse&quot; system). A new naturally aspirated engine called the M64 was used for 964 models, with a flat-6 displacement of 3.6 litres.
Porsche substantially revised the suspension, replacing torsion bars with coil springs and shock absorbers. Power steering and ABS brakes were added to the 911 for the first time; both were standard. The exterior bumpers and fog lamps became flush with the car for better aerodynamics. A new electric rear spoiler raised at speeds above and lowered down flush with the rear engine lid at lower speeds. A revised interior featured standard dual airbags beginning in late 1989 for all North American production 1990 MY cars. A new automatic climate control system provided improved heating and cooling. Revised instrumentation housed a large set of warning lights that were tied into the car&#x27;s central warning system, alerting the driver to a possible problem or malfunction.

==Carrera RS variants==

In 1992, Porsche produced a super-lightweight, rear-wheel-drive only version of the 964 dubbed Carrera RS for the European market. It was based on Porsche&#x27;s 911 &quot;Carrera Cup&quot; race car and harked back to the 2.7 and 3.0 RS and RSR models. It featured a revised version of the standard engine, titled M64/03 internally, with a marginally increased power output of and a lightweight flywheel coupled to the G50/10 transmission with closer ratios, asymmetrical limited slip differential, and steel synchromesh. A track-oriented suspension system with lower ride height, stiffer springs, shocks and adjustable stabilizer bars without power steering (RHD UK cars did have power steering).

Two versions were available; the standard RS and Clubsport.

The standard RS or heavier &quot;Touring&quot; variant included more creature comforts when compared with the Clubsport (thin carpets, some sound deadening, leather lined bucket seats, undercarriage protection with options such as a radio, power windows, and air conditioning).

The Clubsport package (option code M003) included a fully a stripped-out interior devoid of power windows, seats, rear seats, air conditioning, cruise control, stereo system, sound deadening and carpeting. It was equipped with a roll cage and full racing-bucket front seats. The bonnet was aluminum and the chassis was seam welded. Wheels were magnesium and the glass was thinner in the doors and rear window. At , the Carrera RS is approximately lighter than the US-market RS America. Porsche made 290 cars with the M003 option code.

Towards the end of the production run a limited production version was available in Europe; called the Carrera 3.8 RS. It featured the wider Turbo body and a 3.8-litre version of the M64 motor. This engine was bored out by 2 mm for a total of 3,746 cc, and was also available in a more powerful competition version called the 3.8 RSR. Only 11 3.8 spec cars were equipped with the Clubsport package.

===RS America===

The Carrera RS was not sold in the United States because Porsche Cars North America realized the challenges of the RS complying with U.S. federal crash / emission laws . In 1992, 45 US-legal cars that were very similar to the Carrera RS were imported to the US for a proposed &quot;Porsche Carrera Cup&quot; racing series. This Carrera Cup series was to function as a support race for the American CART racing series just as European Carrera Cup has supported Formula One.

These 45 cars were identical to a Carrera RS other than having airbags (with required electric windows), alarm system, American lighting, American bumpers, aluminum wheels, and standard seats. The cars otherwise had the lightweight seam welded chassis, lightweight interior trim, aluminum hood, lightweight door glass, suspension, brakes, G50/10 transmission and M64/03 engine etc. of the Carrera RS. These cars were approximately 200 pounds (90 kg) lighter than a normal US Carrera 2 model.

The plan was for Andial, the then equivalent of what is now Porsche Motorsport US, to convert these cars to full racing specification, however, due to lack of sponsor support, the Carrera Cup series was cancelled before it began. The 45 cars imported to the US for this series were then sold, quietly without any advertising so as not to compete with the new RS America, through normal dealer channels. These cars were supplied with a dash plaque which indicated that they were the &quot;Carrera Cup US Edition&quot;.

In order to please devoted American 911 enthusiasts who wanted an RS model, Porsche produced the less uncompromising RS America. The RS America was produced as a model year 1993 and 1994 car based on the US Carrera 2. A total of 701 were produced. The cars were offered in standard colors red, black and white and optional colors midnight blue metallic and polar silver. A total of four color to sample cars were manufactured in Ferrari Yellow. The first was custom manufactured for the New York Auto Show, the other three were custom &quot;color to sample&quot;. There was also a very small number of other color to sample cars, but the $2498 cost to order was high for 1993. The RS America featured a distinctive &quot;whale tail&quot; spoiler, a partially stripped interior with flat door panels, with fabric door pulls, (from the European RS) and carpeting along with a luggage shelf with storage underneath (1993 model only) replacing the rear seats. Cloth covered sports seats, 17 inch wheels and M030 Sports Suspension were fitted as standard. Lightweight fabric trunk mats were included. The logo &quot;RS America&quot; was placed on the rear deck lid along with an &quot;RS&quot; logo in front of the rear wheels. Deleted to save weight were power steering, cruise control, powered side mirrors, air-conditioning, sunroof and radio, although the air-conditioning, sunroof and radio as well as a limited slip differential could be ordered as options. The RS America was listed by Porsche as weighing , lighter than the weight listed for a stock Carrera 2. The standard US Carrera 2 engine and gearbox were used. These vehicles became popular among racing enthusiasts and were often purpose used in racetrack and auto cross events.

==964 Cup==

Based on the Porsche 964 was the 1990 racing version for the new Porsche Carrera Cup. In addition to an increase in output by 11 kW to , the 964 Cup had a welded roll-cage, a modified chassis set-up and the ground clearance was lower than on the standard version. To reduce weight much of the interior comforts including the sound-proofing material was removed. The gear ratios were modified and it had non power-steering. The vehicle did have a catalytic converter and an anti-lock braking system (ABS).

In 1992, the 964 Cup had a major revision. The vehicle now had the body from the 964RS and the engine now produced . Another major change was that the ABS could be switched off in the event of emergency braking or whilst the car was going backwards. The vehicle now had 18 inch magnesium rims, which replaced the aluminium rims. The car was lowered by a further 20 mm.

=== Technical data ===
==Turbo==

=== Turbo 3.3 ===

Porsche introduced the 964 Turbo model in March, 1990 as the successor to the 930. However, they did not have the time necessary to develop a turbocharged version of the 3.6-litre M64 engine, and chose to re-use the 3.3-litre engine from the 930, with several minor revisions that made the engine smoother, less prone to turbo lag and more powerful, with a total output of at 5,750 rpm. A total of 3,660 964 Turbos were built.

In 1992, the 3.3 litre Turbo S Leichtbau (light build) was introduced. Some 25-50 units were planned, though this was later increased to 80. The standard Turbo model was modified to produce with bigger injectors, more boost, more aggressive camshafts, and a lightweight interior with limited &quot;creature comforts&quot;, making the Turbo S one of the fastest cars on the road. With suspensions lowered by 40 mm, a front strut brace and manual steering, the Turbo S was geared towards performance. The Leichtbau requirement was achieved by deleting the under-body protection, soundproofing, air conditioning, power steering and rear seats, while further savings came from thinner glass, aluminium doors, a carbon-fibre luggage compartment and thinner carpets, the result being a reduction of 180kg over the standard Turbo. Production of the Turbo S Leichtbau began in July 1992 for the 1993 model year. Some sources state that Porsche ended up building six more cars than the 80 planned.

=== Turbo 3.6 ===
Porsche released the 964 Turbo 3.6 in January 1993, now featuring a KK&amp;K K27 turbocharged version of the 3.6 litre M64 engine developing at 5,500 rpm and at 4,200 rpm of torque, produced only for model year 1993/1994, with fewer than 1,500 of them produced in total, making it one of the rarest and most sought after Porsches produced since the 959. A black 1994 MY was used in the Bad Boys movie, starring Will Smith.

At the end of 964 production in 1994, the Porsche factory had some 90 Turbo chassis left. These were all transferred to &quot;Porsche Exclusiv&quot; and built as the very special Turbo 3.6 S, available either with the traditional 964 Turbo 3.6 body or with the exclusive flachbau &#x27;slant nose&#x27; option.

Option X83 (Japan), X84 (non-US) and X85 (US), the Turbo S Flachbau, was available in the US as a US$60,179 option on top of the base price US$99,000 Turbo 3.6. The flachbau option was available when ordering the no charge &#x27;36S&#x27; option &#x27;1994 Turbo &quot;S&quot; Model&#x27; at a price of $60,179. In addition to the slantnose fenders, it also included the &#x27;X88&#x27; option which included the &#x27;Turbo S&#x27; motor, the &#x27;X92&#x27; Exclusive front spoiler, &#x27;X93&#x27; Exclusive rear spoiler and &#x27;X99&#x27; Exclusive rear fender air intakes based on the Porsche 959. The flachbau option was designed around the model 968 front end, and the 930 style Turbo S front end for Japan (right down to the sill covers on the fenders). 39 Models were made for US markets, 27 for international market and 10 for Japan, all in Polar Silver (http://flachbau.com). An additional 17 X85 models were commissioned by Porsche Exclusiv for the US, known as the &quot;Package cars,&quot; replacing the slantnose front end with the original 964-style front end.

===Specifications===
==30th Anniversary C4==
In 1993 Porsche introduced the 30th Anniversary C4 to commemorate 30 years since the 911 launch in 1963. Its based on the wider turbo body and wheels with 4 wheel drive, but with a normally aspirated engine and standard small lifting wing. 911 units were produced, and the car was only offered in Viola, Polar Silver or Amethyst. This version was the start of a line that continued with the 993 C4S and 996 C4S.

==Turbo S LM-GT==
Also in 1993 Porsche developed a highly tuned 964 Turbo S prototype for use in international motorsport. This car, known as the Turbo S Le Mans GT (or simply Turbo S LM-GT), was based on the standard road-legal Turbo S, but stripped down and modified for circuit use. A deep chin spoiler was added to the front, while two air inlets were added just above the rear wheel arches. An adjustable racing rear wing was added on top of the standard Turbo&#x27;s wing. Wider wheel arches were used to house wide racing slicks. The interior was completely stripped, a rollcage added, and the windows replaced with plastic. The engine used was not the standard road-car unit, but a smaller twin-turbocharged 3.2 liter unit which produced 475 hp.

The Turbo S LM-GT made its debut at the 1993 12 Hours of Sebring where the car finished seventh overall and first in its class with the Brumos Porsche racing team (Röhrl-Stuck-Haywood). From there, the car was entered in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, running under the guise of the Porsche factory team. The car would however fail to finish after the engine was damaged early in the race. For 1994, the Turbo S LM-GT would be moved to the hands of Larbre Compétition, where a new 3.6 liter engine based on the 993 unit would be used in place of the 3.2 liter engine. The team opened the year with a second-place finish at the 24 Hours of Daytona, before moving on to select rounds of the BPR Global GT Series. The car would win all four races in which it competed, including the 1000 km Suzuka. The Turbo S LM-GT would make a few select appearances in 1995 with Obermaier Racing before being retired.

The development work from the Turbo S LM-GT helped Porsche in creating the 993-generation 911 GT2 in 1995, which would be mass-produced and sold to racing customers. Some teams, unable to buy new 911 GT2s, developed their own twin-turbo racing versions of the 964 Turbo to mimic the Turbo S LM-GT, but lacked the success of the factory project.

==964 Speedster==

There were two distinct incarnations of the air-cooled 911 Speedster. The first was the 1989 model year Speedster. Shown at the 1988 Frankfurt Motor Show beside the upcoming Carrera 4, the 1989 Speedster actually shared more in common with the 930 turbo than with the upcoming 964 generation 911s, causing it to be looked upon, in retrospect, as a much inferior &quot;driver&#x27;s car&quot; to the later 1994 Speedster. More than three quarters (641) of the 800 built had the &quot;Turbo look&quot; wide-body option.

The 1994 Porsche 911 Speedster was available either in standard or lightweight trim called “clubsport.&quot; Unlike the 1989 model, the 1994 Speedster was based on the new Carrera 2 platform and was not initially available with the &quot;Turbo look&quot; wide-body style. The 1994 Speedster was designed to be a more focused &quot;driver&#x27;s car&quot; and served as a hybrid between a 964 Carrera 2 Cabriolet and a 964 RS. While it featured a softer suspension set up than the 964 RS, it offered almost none of the comforts of a normal 964 Carrera 2 Cabriolet, though power windows were standard and it was available with air conditioning and a stereo. Porsche planned to build 3000 examples of the 1994 Speedsters in 1992, but only 936 examples were built and sold during the two years of production. Once again, the United States was the most important market with 427 Speedsters heading Stateside. Right hand drive versions were exceptionally rare this time: only 27 cars compared to 139 examples in right hand drive of the pre-964 911 Speedster. Of these RHD cars 13 were made with UK specification, 8 Australia specification, 4 Singapore specification and either 2 or 3 Hong Kong Specification. Of these RHD there were 6 Speed yellow, 7 Guards Red, 3 Grey, 4 Black, 1 Slate grey, 1 Amazon Green (the only 964 Speedster in this colour), 1 Metallic Silver, 1 Grand Prix White and one Maritime Blue. In addition, 20 special examples were finished at Porsche Exclusive&#x27;s workshop at Werk 1 (Factory 1) with the optional “Turbo look” wide-bodies.

==America Roadster==

A turbo-bodied cabriolet version was released in 1992. This had the standard electric spoiler and turbo guards. Mechanically, it was the same as the standard model, apart from 17-inch Cup wheels and the brakes and suspension, which were to Turbo specifications. Only 250 of this variant were produced in total, for the 1992 and 1993 model years.

==Porsche 969==
The Porsche 969 was a concept intended to succeed the Porsche 959 and was based on the then upcoming 964 platform.

The car was conceived in 1982 as a twin-turbo 911 with four-wheel drive and a PDK gearbox. The project received the in-house code &quot;965&quot; and was developed along with the new, 964 generation of the 911. However, the intended engine (a 3.3 litre, flat-six) could not be used due to cooling problems. Various alternatives were considered during the car&#x27;s development, including a water-cooled version of the traditional flat-six and two variants of Porsche&#x27;s Indy V8 engine.

While the 969 shared the 911&#x27;s roofline, its slanted headlights and wide tail were carryovers from the 959.

Ultimately, the project was scrapped. Ongoing engine development issues and a projected price of over 200.000 DM in the wake of a recession kept it from succeeding the 911 turbo (the 964 turbo made its debut in March 1990). Fifteen of the 16 prototypes were destroyed in December 1988 and the sole remaining prototype has not been seen since. Porsche later disclosed that it kept it hidden from public at a warehouse near Zuffenhausen.

<text>Kain is a character and the main protagonist and title character of the &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; video game series. First introduced in &quot;Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain&quot; in 1996, he was created by Denis Dyack and Silicon Knights, and has appeared in all subsequent &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; games under the direction of developer Crystal Dynamics. Between games, he serves as either the central playable character, or as an antagonist, but in all his depictions he has consistently been described as an antihero.

Drawing inspiration from the morally ambiguous character of William Munny from Clint Eastwood&#x27;s 1992 film &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, Silicon Knights conceived Kain as a nobleman murdered and revived as a vampire to take revenge on his assassins. He gradually embraces his new existence, and learns of his birthright to maintain balance in Nosgoth (the fictional setting of the series). Crystal Dynamics later portrayed Kain as an Oedipus-like figure, seeking to thwart the fate determined for him before his birth.

Beyond his role in the series, Kain has also featured in tie-in comics, and in Crystal Dynamics&#x27; &quot;Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light&quot;. In all of his voiced appearances, he has been played by actor Simon Templeman. He has been favorably received by critics and fans, with praise centering around his memorable personality, nuanced characterization and moral greyness; his transition from protagonist in &quot;Blood Omen&quot; to antagonist in &quot;Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&quot; was positively singled out.

==Concept and creation==
Kain&#x27;s character was originally conceived circa 1993 by Silicon Knights&#x27; president, Denis Dyack, as the protagonist of &quot;The Pillars of Nosgoth&quot;, an initial video game concept for what would become 1996&#x27;s &quot;Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain&quot;. He was modeled in part on William Munny, the protagonist of Clint Eastwood&#x27;s 1992 Western film, &quot;Unforgiven&quot;. The developers set out to craft an antihero to suit &quot;a game where the player is put in the position where everyone believes you are evil&quot;, feeling that the industry required a story addressing issues of moral ambiguity and wondering how players would react when &quot;everyone in the world was your enemy (including yourself) [...] where you had to kill innocents to survive [and] you are the ultimate pawn&quot;. Other influences which helped to define Kain&#x27;s character arc included &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot;, &quot;Necroscope&quot;, and cover art from &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot;. In comparison to Count Dracula, Dyack commented in an interview that he believed Kain would &quot;kick his ass&quot; in a fight. He and writer Ken McCulloch considered Simon Templeman&#x27;s voiceover for the character superlative, despite initial apprehensions that the actors they had hired might not be able to convey the game&#x27;s complicated dialogue.

After a legal dispute with Silicon Knights, &quot;Blood Omen&quot; publisher Crystal Dynamics obtained the rights to the &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; intellectual property, with Amy Hennig directing Kain&#x27;s characterization for the sequel, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&quot;. In this game, which built upon the &quot;Blood Omen&quot; ending in which he damns the world, Kain adopted the role of antagonist, with new character Raziel serving as the lead. Hennig justified this choice, believing that it would prove interesting to see what his decision had engendered after a few millennia. She emphasized, though, that she did not consider him a monster or mustache-twirling villain, remarking that &quot;in many ways, he&#x27;s a more complex and sympathetic character than Raziel himself&quot;. Sources which helped to formulate his role in the plot ranged from Biblical lore to Eastern myth and mysticism.

In interviews preceding the release of 2001&#x27;s &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot;, Hennig said that Crystal Dynamics had a huge investment in Kain as a character. His portrayal in this game extrapolated further from &quot;Blood Omen&quot;&#x27;s story, and was influenced by Joseph Campbell&#x27;s ideals. No longer acting as a pure villain, Kain was intended to function as a &quot;steadfast character&quot;, coming to the story from a position of knowledge in contrast to Raziel&#x27;s relative ignorance. Hennig expressed that, by &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot;, her personal perception of Kain&#x27;s character had changed over the years, and that she now considered him a somewhat more attractive and interesting individual than Raziel due to his complexity. She dubbed him a tragic hero, &quot;screwed by his own character flaws&quot;, and argued that this hamartia added to his depth. Since joining Naughty Dog, when asked whether Raziel or Kain is closest to her heart, Hennig has said that while Raziel is a sympathetic protagonist, she probably prefers Kain as a character.

For 2002&#x27;s &quot;Blood Omen 2&quot;, developed by a different team within Crystal Dynamics, Kain returned as the playable protagonist. The development staff chose to focus on his rise to power as a younger vampire, combining aspects of his &quot;Blood Omen&quot; and &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; incarnations. He was marketed as a more powerful and ruthless character than traditional video game heroes, with lead designer Mike Ellis inviting comparison to &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;&#x27;s Kefka Palazzo and Revolver Ocelot of the &quot;Metal Gear series&quot;. Design issues, raised by the wealth of abilities and equipment he accumulated in &quot;Blood Omen&quot;, prompted the team to add to his backstory and convincingly deprive him of these powers. Producer Sam Newman described him as &quot;a very unique character&quot; who &quot;doesn&#x27;t fit to the generic character molds you find in many other games, books and movies [...] not good, he&#x27;s not necessarily evil - Kain does as Kain believes&quot;.

&quot;Legacy of Kain: Defiance&quot;, released in 2003, returned to the aged, elder Kain from &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; and &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot;, now controllable alongside Raziel. The prospect of making this incarnation of Kain playable left the development team &quot;very excited&quot;, and was agreed upon very early in pre-production. Recognizing that he is &quot;the most important character in the series&quot;, designer Kyle Mannerberg named several parallels and influences concerning his development up to that point, citing Neo and John Murdoch (the protagonists of &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;Dark City&quot; respectively), the archetypal Fisher King of Arthurian legend, the story of Oedipus, and Gnostic myth as inspirations (with both latter sources being reaffirmed as strong influences by Hennig in a later interview). The spells he obtains over the course of his levels were intended to pay homage to the original &quot;Blood Omen&quot;.

==Characteristics==
Kain&#x27;s appearance undergoes &quot;pretty dramatic changes&quot; throughout the games as he ages, but core personality attributes cited by &quot;Defiance&quot;&#x27;s developers include his intelligence and cynicism, arrogance and regality, and his defiant nature. In the series&#x27; fictional universe, he is described as the guardian of balance, a being responsible for preserving the health and integrity of Nosgoth (the games&#x27; setting), but left incapable of realizing this duty due to spiritual corruption that he inherited at birth.

The character&#x27;s transformation into a vampire, and the visceral nature this trait lends the series, was derived from William Shakespeare&#x27;s classical models: &quot;for the drunken commoners in the front rows he would insert dirty jokes to keep them entertained but for the aristocracy in the balconies he would write very cerebral metaphors&quot;. According to Silicon Knights, the graphic violence and vampirism in &quot;Blood Omen&quot; served as their &quot;dirty jokes&quot;, supplemented by a complex story.

As the story progresses, Kain evolves from a directionless young nobleman, to a lithe and devious vampire, to a &quot;craggy&quot; figure. As a playable character, he frequently narrates his thoughts through the dramatic device of soliloquy. In &quot;Blood Omen&quot; and &quot;Defiance&quot;, his battle cry and catchphrase is Vae victis, a Latin phrase attributed to Brennus meaning &quot;woe to the conquered&quot;.

==Appearances==
===Debut===

In &quot;Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain&quot;, Kain is introduced as a young human noble. In the game&#x27;s prologue, he is murdered by assassins, and resurrected as a vampire by Mortanius, a necromancer. He is promised both vengeance and a cure to his vampirism if he can restore the nine Pillars of Nosgoth, edifices whose state dictates the vitality of the world; the nine guardians who symbiotically represent the Pillars were corrupted prior to his birth, and must be killed before the land can recover. During his quest, he meets the ancient vampire Vorador, who influences him to forsake his former humanity and accept his vampirism, and discovers the Soul Reaver, a legendary soul-devouring sword. Using the Reaver, he tries to alter the course of Nosgoth&#x27;s history to prevent the Nemesis — a tyrant king — from coming to power. Tricked by Moebius, the guardian of time, Kain succeeds in destroying the Nemesis, but the temporal paradox this triggers results in a new timeline in which vampires have been hunted to extinction; Kain is left the last surviving vampire in Nosgoth. After systematically tracking down and killing most of the guardians, he confronts Mortanius — revealed as the guardian of death, and the orchestrator of Kain&#x27;s assassination. After killing Mortanius, a malevolent, mysterious being known as The Dark Entity emerges from Mortanius&#x27;s body where he tells Kain that he is the one who orchestrated the murder of Ariel (by possessing Mortanius) and the entire affair in Nosgoth, while Mortanius attempted to save Nosgoth and fight mentally against him before succumbing. Kain confronts The Dark Entity in final battle by slaying him. After the battle, Kain realizes that he himself is the final guardian, and that the cure to his curse entails his own destruction. Faced with the obligation of self-sacrifice — thereby restoring the world, but ensuring the annihilation of the vampire race or the alternative of destroying the Pillars to rule over the world in its miasmatic state. Although both options are available to the player, the canon established in the sequels proves that Kain opts for the latter choice, embracing vampirism as a blessing as the Pillars collapse.

===&quot;Soul Reaver&quot; games===

&quot;Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&quot; features Kain as the main antagonist and a recurring boss character, narratively following him centuries after his decision. Since the first game, Kain has revived the vampire race, and has become the despotic ruler of the land. When the game&#x27;s protagonist, his lieutenant Raziel, surpasses Kain, Raziel is executed for his transgression. Resurrected by The Elder God, Raziel returns to destroy his former brethren and Kain, and eventually confronts Kain at the ruins of the Pillars. Kain attacks Raziel with the Soul Reaver, but the blade shatters when it strikes him, and Kain escapes, strangely satisfied. Raziel discovers, to his horror, that Kain created him and his other lieutenants from the corpses of the Sarafan, an ancient order of vampire hunters. He fights Kain a second time in Moebius&#x27;s abandoned time machine, the Chronoplast, where Kain explains the nature of free will and rationalizes his actions. Narrowly escaping, Kain activates the Chronoplast and travels into the past, with Raziel pursuing him as the game ends.

In &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot;, Kain acts as a non-player character encountered by Raziel in several cutscenes. As the game&#x27;s plot progresses, his agenda and motives become clearer. He seeks a third option to the dilemma prescribed for him at the end of &quot;Blood Omen&quot;, hoping to both restore Nosgoth and return the Pillars to vampire control. Having viewed the timestream, he learned that history is predestined, and seeks to change his fate by triggering more temporal paradoxes, an objective which demanded Raziel&#x27;s temporary destruction. It is revealed that Raziel is destined to be consumed by the Soul Reaver, thus becoming the soul-devouring entity trapped within the weapon. With Raziel&#x27;s help, Kain is able to defy history and prevent his own pre-ordained death, and, in return, he saves Raziel from being consumed by the Reaver at the story&#x27;s climax. However, this alteration putatively changes history for the worse, leading into the events of &quot;Blood Omen 2&quot; and &quot;Legacy of Kain: Defiance&quot;.

===&quot;Blood Omen 2&quot; and &quot;Defiance&quot;===

&quot;Blood Omen 2&quot; pursues a younger Kain during his early conquests of Nosgoth, in the altered timeline triggered by the changes to Raziel&#x27;s destiny at the end of &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot;. &quot;Legacy of Kain: Defiance&quot; takes place in the same altered timeline, periodically switching between the characters of the elder Kain and Raziel from &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot;, with both acting as playable protagonists. Over the course of the game, Moebius manipulates Kain into believing he is a champion prophesied to fight against and destroy Raziel, culminating in a final battle between the two characters which Raziel wins. It is discovered that The Elder God is malevolent, and he and Moebius—his servant—had conspired against Kain from the outset of the series, considering vampires an abomination. Kain, after being presumed dead, returns, and reconciles with Raziel, who willingly enters the Soul Reaver. As he does so, he uses his powers to cleanse Kain of the corruption he inherited at birth as a Pillar guardian. Armed with the ancient sword once again, Kain is able to see and battle The Elder God for the first time, but is unable to destroy him. The story ends as he looks out at the Nosgoth landscape; though uncertain that he can ever restore the world, he contemplates Raziel&#x27;s sacrifice and the &quot;first bitter taste&quot; of hope it has given him.

==Promotion and reception==
Several action figures and figurines of Kain have been created by Blue Box Interactive and the National Entertainment Collectibles Association in partnership with Eidos. He was featured extensively in marketing for the &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; series, including a $1 million advertising campaign for &quot;Soul Reaver&quot;. Beyond the games, he also appeared in Top Cow&#x27;s promotional comics for &quot;Soul Reaver&quot; and &quot;Defiance&quot;, and was included alongside Raziel as a playable character in downloadable content for 2010&#x27;s &quot;Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light&quot;. He is set to appear in &quot;Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver – The Dead Shall Rise&quot;, a graphic novel prequel to &quot;Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&quot;.

Opinion on Kain&#x27;s character has been largely positive in critical reviews of the &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; games. Praise has frequently been directed towards Simon Templeman&#x27;s voice acting, with &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;Game Revolution&quot; citing Kain&#x27;s soliloquies as &quot;both gruesome and entertaining&quot;, &quot;the best part [of the game&#x27;s audio]&quot; and &quot;one of the best stints of voice acting ever recorded&quot; respectively in their assessments of his debut in the original &quot;Blood Omen&quot;. Magazines have also described him as one of the best video game villains. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; praised Kain&#x27;s role as an antagonist, but noted that he &quot;lives in more of a grey area than most of the villains&quot;. For &quot;Blood Omen 2&quot;, although critics expressed disappointment with the game itself, they praised Kain&#x27;s character nevertheless; &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Greg Kasavin branded him &quot;a very intriguing protagonist&quot; and &quot;as memorable of a main character as they come&quot;, while &quot;IGN&quot;″s Douglass C. Perry felt he was &quot;incredibly likeable&quot;, and &quot;in a very true sense [...] a great videogame character&quot;. &quot;GameZone&quot;″s Michael Knutson opined that he was a &quot;wicked cool character&quot;, and &quot;Game Revolution&quot;″s Johnny Liu named him a &quot;great anti-hero&quot;. Kasavin again praised him in a review for &quot;Defiance&quot;, writing that &quot;it&#x27;s rare enough to find a truly memorable main character in a game, let alone two&quot;, and that the game&#x27;s ensemble cast &quot;[to some extent superseded] the problems in the gameplay&quot;. Ian Dransfield of &quot;Play&quot; has stated that &quot;we totally and completely fell in love with [Kain]&quot; and highlighted him as a &quot;character who [needs] to be revived&quot;.

Some reviewers were less enthusiastic about aspects of the character, with &quot;IGN&quot;″s Perry commenting that his &quot;Soul Reaver 2&quot; dialogue was haughty and &quot;overwritten&quot;, and Ivan Sulic considering his &quot;Blood Omen 2&quot; incarnation &quot;nothing more than an arrogant jerk with little to latch on to and care about&quot; while expressing preference for Raziel. Also relating to &quot;Blood Omen 2&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot;″s Aaron Boulding regarded his pompous nature as his &quot;one personality trait&quot;, and considered it comedic, while Matt Casamassina felt Kain was &quot;cool&quot;, but decried his visual design as &quot;flamboyant to the point of being comical&quot;. Alex Lucard of &quot;DieHard GameFan&quot; described Kain as an interesting character and one of gaming&#x27;s most memorable vampires, discussing how his personality shifted between a portrayal as a &quot;petty jealous monster&quot; and a &quot;wise but arrogant ruler.&quot; Alex felt this was not contradictory, as it felt like what a creature as old as Kain would experience, calling this aspect of his character &quot;&quot;well developed and tragic.&quot; He also found that the shift in character role was rare in the medium and made him &quot;deep.&quot;

<text>Amitav Ghosh (born 11 July 1956) is an Indian writer. He won the 54th Jnanpith award in 2018, India&#x27;s highest literary honour. Ghosh&#x27;s ambitious novels use complex narrative strategies to probe the nature of national and personal identity, particularly of the people of India and South Asia. He has written historical fiction and non-fiction works discussing topics such as colonialism and climate change.

Ghosh studied at The Doon School, Dehradun, and earned a doctorate in social anthropology at the University of Oxford. He worked at the &quot;Indian Express&quot; newspaper in New Delhi and several academic institutions. His first novel, &quot;The Circle of Reason&quot;, was published in 1986, which he followed with later fictional works, including &quot;The Shadow Lines&quot; and &quot;The Glass Palace.&quot; Between 2004 and 2015, he worked on the &quot;Ibis&quot; trilogy, which revolves around the build-up and implications of the First Opium War. His non-fiction work includes &quot;In an Antique Land&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable&quot; (2016).

Ghosh holds two Lifetime Achievement awards and four honorary doctorates. In 2007, he was awarded the Padma Shri, one of India&#x27;s highest honours, by the President of India. In 2010, he was a joint winner, along with Margaret Atwood, of a Dan David prize, and in 2011, he was awarded the Grand Prix of the Blue Metropolis festival in Montreal. He was the first English-language writer to receive the award. In 2019, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine named him one of the most important global thinkers of the preceding decade.

==Life==
Ghosh was born in Calcutta on 11 July 1956 and was educated at the all-boys boarding school The Doon School in Dehradun. He grew up in India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. His contemporaries at Doon included author Vikram Seth and historian Ram Guha. While at school, he regularly contributed fiction and poetry to &quot;The Doon School Weekly&quot; (then edited by Seth) and founded the magazine &quot;History Times&quot; along with Guha. After Doon, he received degrees from St Stephen&#x27;s College and the Delhi School of Economics, both part of Delhi University.

Ghosh then won the Inlaks Foundation scholarship to complete a D. Phil. in social anthropology at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, under the supervision of British social anthropologist Peter Lienhardt. His thesis, undertaken in the Faculty of Anthropology and Geography, was entitled, &quot;Kinship in relation to economic and social organization in an Egyptian village community&quot;, and submitted in 1982.

Ghosh returned to India to begin working on the &quot;Ibis&quot; trilogy, which includes &quot;Sea of Poppies&quot; (2008), &quot;River of Smoke&quot; (2011), and &quot;Flood of Fire&quot; (2015).

In 2007, Ghosh was awarded the Padma Shri by the Indian government. In 2009, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. In 2015, he was named a Ford Foundation Art of Change Fellow.

Ghosh currently lives in New York with his wife, Deborah Baker, author of the Laura Riding biography &quot;In Extremis: The Life of Laura Riding&quot; (1993) and a senior editor at Little, Brown and Company. They have two children, Lila and Nayan.

==Work==

===Fiction===

Ghosh&#x27;s historical fiction novels include &quot;The Circle of Reason&quot; (his 1986 debut novel), &quot;The Shadow Lines&quot; (1988), &quot;The Calcutta Chromosome&quot; (1996), &quot;The Glass Palace&quot; (2000), &quot;The Hungry Tide&quot; (2004), and &quot;Gun Island&quot; (2019).

Ghosh began working on the &quot;Ibis&quot; trilogy in 2004. Set in the 1830s, its story follows the build-up of the First Opium War across China and the Indian Ocean region. Its consists of &quot;Sea of Poppies&quot; (2008), &quot;River of Smoke&quot; (2011), and &quot;Flood of Fire&quot; (2015).

Most of Ghosh&#x27;s work deals with historical settings, especially in the Indian Ocean periphery. In an interview with historian Mahmood Kooria, he said: 

&quot;The Shadow Lines&quot;, according to one blogger, &quot;throws light on the phenomenon of communal violence and the way its roots have spread deeply and widely in the collective psyche of the Indian subcontinent&quot;. 

&quot;Gun Island&quot;, published in 2019, deals with climate change and human migration, drew praise from critics. According to a review in the &quot;Columbia Journal&quot;, 

The novel creates a world of realistic fiction, challenging the agency of its readers to act upon the demands of the environment. The use of religion, magical realism, coincidences, and climate change come together to create a wholesome story of strife, trauma, adventure, and mystery. The reader takes on the journey to solve the story of &quot;the Gun Merchant&quot; and launches themselves into the destruction of nature and the effects of human actions. Ghosh transforms the novel through his main character, his story, and the very prevalent climate crisis. The novel is advertently a call to action intertwined in an entertaining plot. &quot;The Guardian&quot; however, noted Ghosh&#x27;s tendency to go on tangents, calling it &quot;a shaggy dog story&quot; that &quot;can take a very roundabout path towards reality, but it will get there in the end&quot;.

In 2021, Ghosh published his first book in verse, &quot;Jungle Nama,&quot; which explores the Sundarbans legend of Bon Bibi.

===Non-fiction===

Ghosh&#x27;s notable non-fiction writings include &quot;In an Antique Land&quot; (1992), &quot;Dancing in Cambodia and at Large in Burma&quot; (1998), &quot;Countdown&quot; (1999), and &quot;The Imam and the Indian&quot; (2002), a collection of essays on themes such as fundamentalism, the history of the novel, Egyptian culture, and literature. His writings have appeared in newspapers and magazines in India and abroad.

In &quot;The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable&quot; (2016), Ghosh accuses modern literature and art of failing to adequately address climate change. In &quot;The Nutmeg&#x27;s Curse: Parables for a Planet in Crisis&quot; (2021), Ghosh follows the journey of nutmeg from its native Banda Islands to many other parts of the world, using the spice as a lens through which to understand the historical influence of colonialism upon attitudes towards Indigenous cultures and environmental change. In his latest work, &quot;Smoke and Ashes: A Writer&#x27;s Journey Through Opium&#x27;s Hidden Histories&quot; (2023), Ghosh discusses the history of opium, focusing on its colonial history and legacy in India and China and its connection to modern corporate practices, such as Purdue Pharma&#x27;s role in the ongoing US opioid epidemic. Its discussion of the lead-up to the First Opium War in the 1830s also serves as background to Ghosh&#x27;s fictional &quot;Ibis&quot; trilogy.

===Awards and recognition===

&quot;The Circle of Reason&quot; (1986) won the &quot;Prix Médicis étranger&quot;, one of France&#x27;s top literary awards. &quot;The Shadow Lines&quot; (1988) won the Sahitya Akademi Award and the Ananda Puraskar. &quot;The Calcutta Chromosome&quot; (1996) won the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1997. &quot;Sea of Poppies&quot; (2008), the first installment of the &quot;Ibis&quot; trilogy, was shortlisted for the 2008 Man Booker Prize. It was the co-winner of the Vodafone Crossword Book Award in 2009, as well as co-winner of the 2010 Dan David Prize. &quot;River of Smoke&quot; (2011), the second &quot;Ibis&quot; installment, was shortlisted for the Man Asian Literary Prize 2011.

Ghosh famously withdrew his novel &quot;The Glass Palace&quot; (2000) from consideration for the Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize, where it was awarded the best novel in the Eurasian section, citing his objections to the term &quot;Commonwealth&quot; and the unfairness of the English-language requirement specified in the rules.

The government of India awarded Ghosh the civilian honour of Padma Shri in 2007. He received a lifetime achievement award at Tata Literature Live, the Mumbai LitFest, on 20 November 2016. He was conferred the 54th Jnanpith award in December 2018 and is the first Indian writer in English to have been chosen for this honour.

Ghosh was awarded the Erasmus Prize 2024, specifically for his writing on climate change: &quot;His work offers a remedy by making an uncertain future palpable through compelling stories about the past. He also wields his pen to show that the climate crisis is a cultural crisis that results from a dearth of the imagination.&quot;

His book &quot;Smoke and Ashes: Opium’s Hidden Histories,&quot; made the 2024 British Academy Book Prize shortlist.

<doc id="749435" wikidata="Q596937" url="?curid=749435" title="Rut (mammalian reproduction)">
<text>The rut (from the Latin &quot;rugire&quot;, meaning &quot;to roar&quot;) is the mating season of certain mammals, which includes ruminants such as deer, sheep, camels, goats, pronghorns, bison, giraffes and antelopes, and extends to others such as skunks and elephants. The rut is characterized in males by an increase in testosterone, exaggerated sexual dimorphisms, increased aggression, and increased interest in females. The males of the species may mark themselves with mud, undergo physiological changes or perform characteristic displays in order to make themselves more visually appealing to the females. Males also use olfaction to entice females to mate using secretions from glands and soaking in their own urine. 

During the rut (known as the &quot;rutting period&quot; and in domestic sheep management as &quot;tupping&quot;), males often rub their antlers or horns on trees or shrubs, fight with each other, wallow in mud or dust, self-anoint, and herd estrus females together. These displays make the male conspicuous and aid in mate selection.

The rut in many species is triggered by shorter day lengths. For different species, the timing of the rut depends on the length of the gestation period (pregnancy), usually occurring so the young are born in the spring. This is shortly after new green growth has appeared thereby providing food for the females, allowing them to provide milk for the young, and when the temperatures are warm enough to reduce the risk of young becoming hypothermic.

==Cervidae==
===White-tailed deer===

The rut for white-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;) usually lasts three weeks in the Northern Hemisphere and may occur most of the year in tropical zones. The rut is the time when white-tail deer, especially bucks, are more active and less cautious than usual. This makes them easier to hunt, as well as more susceptible to being hit by motor vehicles.

Outdoors writer Charles Alsheimer has done research demonstrating the white-tailed deer rut is also controlled by the lunar phase and that the rut peaks seven days after the second full moon during October and November (the rutting moon), while elk begin rutting during the September equinox on 21 September.

A white-tail doe may be in estrus for up to 72 hours and may come into estrus up to seven times if she does not mate. Cows may come into estrus up to four or more times if they do not mate. Some people believe that it is possible that does can enter a second estrus around 28 to 30 days from its first estrus if the doe isn&#x27;t bred. There are also studies that show that some does actively participate in seeking out possible mates in areas where there are less males to increase the chances of finding males and being bred.

The rut can start as early as the end of September and can last all the way through the winter months. Bucks usually begin this process when the velvet is falling off their antlers, and it can last all the way until they start to shed their antlers. The peak of the rut, however, is right in the middle. The average peak day for the white-tail rut in the U.S. is November 13. Around this period of time, the bucks and does are very active, with the rut in full swing. For a hunter sitting in a tree stand at this time of the year, it is not uncommon to see many deer pass through his specific area, due to other deer chasing others.
There are many behaviors a buck will exhibit during the rut. During pre-rut, bucks will spar with each other. Sparring is low-intensity aggressive behavior, involving mostly pushing and shoving. Bucks of different sizes will do this to each other. After pre-rut is finished, a buck will rub his antlers on a tree (thus making a &quot;rub&quot;), and make scrapes on the ground with his hooves: both of these are ways a buck will mark its territory and proclaim his dominance for other bucks to see. These activities are usually done at night. Bucks will make many different scent markings using different scent glands. These scent glands include pedal glands found between the toes, preorbital glands found in the corners of their eyes, tarsal glands found on the lower inside of their hind legs, and the metatarsal glands found in the outside hind leg between ankle and hoof. The deer spread scent from these glands by rubbing hooves during ground scrapes, rubbing faces on tree limbs, and urinating down legs.

The most prominent behavior of all during the heat of the rut is fighting, where bucks show their true dominance to others. In fighting, bucks usually battle against similar-sized deer, and small bucks do not normally challenge mature large ones: more often than not, smaller bucks fear the more mature bucks and leave or avoid the dominant deer&#x27;s territory. These fights can be long in duration with the winner getting the group of does. Some fights result in injuries with some resulting in death.

Studies show that males of all age-classes increased their search efforts for mates during rut. According to the source, &quot;One-year-old males seemed to invest less effort searching for females because movement rates (m/h) were 25–30% lower than in older males&quot;. This data indicates that the youngest males don&#x27;t try as hard as older males to find a mate. The energy expenditure of chasing and fighting during the breeding season can result in a buck losing an immense amount of weight, with some research documenting losses of as much as 20% of body weight with some sources showing body mass losses of up to 30%. On average, a buck before breeding season can weigh up to . After he has gone through the stages of the rut, he can lose about of weight, which is quite large, especially for only a few months of time. In the post-rut, a buck will need to replenish his body and catch up on the weight and energy he has lost.

===Elk (Wapiti)===

The timing of the elk rut depends on where they live. In the Northern Hemisphere, it occurs between mid-August and mid-October. In the Southern Hemisphere it occurs between mid-February and mid-April.

The rut tends to last somewhere between 20 and 45 days. This varies on latitude, which affects the timing of spring and autumn and which can give elk a longer calving season and a longer rut. During the rut, elk frequently use areas around fresh water, and tend to bed in heavy timber five to six hours per day. A cow elk will remain in estrus for 12 to 15 hours, if they are not bred during this time frame they will normally have another estrus cycle 18 to 28 days later.

Elk use several different vocalizations during the rut. Some are made only by a certain sex or age class, and each is used for a different reason. The first of which being the cohesion call which is made by both sexes of elk, and is used to locate one another. An alarm squeal is made by both sexes of elk when they are on alert, during the rut these are used frequently by young bulls (male elks) being run off by the herd bull. Satellite bulls frequently spar with one another during the rut, and in turn make sparring squeaks.

====Bugling====
A bugle is a vocalization made exclusively by bulls. The typical bugle consists of three acoustic parts, a low frequency &quot;on-glide&quot; that sounds guttural in tone, which then ascends into the highest frequency part of the call termed the &quot;whistle&quot;, and the last portion of the call, the &quot;off-glide&quot; that returns to a low-frequency tone. The function behind this acoustic structure of the bugle is directly correlated to the male&#x27;s physiology and how different frequencies travel through varied environments. In terms of physiology, the larger an animal gets the lower frequency of sound it is able to produce. This is because with an increase in size comes an increase in vocal fold length, and longer vocal folds confer an increased ability to produce lower frequency sounds. Because of this relationship, a bugle can be directed toward other bulls or toward cows to demonstrate the size and thus fitness of the bull vocalizing. A bull will direct his bugle toward his cows while gathering them or while chasing an estrus cow. A herd bull will direct his bugle toward another bull to express his dominance over the herd, while a satellite bull may use his bugle to challenge the herd bull. 
The reason for the high-frequency portion of the bugle is due to the propagative efficiency of differing frequencies through varying environments. Studies have shown that as a bull&#x27;s harem increases in diameter, meaning the cows become more dispersed, he tends to vocalize more frequently than if they were within closer proximity. The higher-pitched section of the call propagates through the environment better, which is why the bull uses it to congregate a harem that is becoming more spatially dispersed and thus harder to defend. Acoustic analyses comparing bull elk bugles with cow elk cohesion calls show a notable degree of acoustic similarity, indicating that both vocalizations may perform a congregating function, which is why the bugle is often used by the bull to condense his harem.

====Bugling physiology====
The ability to produce such a high-frequency vocalization by such a large animal is unusual. As explained above, this is because larger body mass positively correlates with longer vocal folds and thus lower frequency emission. Larger body size also corresponds with a decreased ability to emit high frequency vocalizations. Bull elk overcome this by a unique anatomical mechanism that produces sound using a different pathway than the vibrations of the vocal folds. Bull elk constrict their supra laryngeal vocal tract, specifically in the nasal cavity in order to create a smaller opening for exhaled air to pass through. As air moves through this opening it causes the tissues to vibrate and produce the high frequency sound waves which comprise the &quot;whistle&quot; portion of the bugle. This anatomical development for bioacoustics in elk was discovered upon sonographic analysis of bugle vocalizations which revealed a biphonetic (two simultaneous frequencies) display. One frequency was high (the result of the supra laryngeal constriction), and the other was low (the result of normal vocal fold oscillations).

====Yelping====
Yelping also known as &quot;grunting&quot; is usually only made by herd bulls when they are excited. They are made more often while interacting with cows than with other bulls. &quot;Yelping commonly was accompanied by contractions of the penile region with simultaneous emission of short spurts of urine.&quot;

=====Phases=====
The rut has six phases: the pre-rut, the first breeding phase, the first rest phase, the second breeding phase, the second rest phase, and the third breeding phase.

* The pre-rut takes place from mid-August through the beginning of September. During the pre-rut bulls begin bugling and gathering their herds. Bulls will bugle to attract cows as well as to express dominance over other bulls. A &quot;herd&quot; bull is the dominant bull in a herd. Younger, smaller bulls are known as satellite bulls, as they tend to cling to the edges of a herd trying to pick up any cows willing to leave the herd. Larger satellite bulls will challenge the herd bull to try and take control of the herd. These challenges include a good deal of bugling as well as fighting.
* The first breeding phase of the rut takes place between the beginning and the middle of September. This is when the three year and older cows come into estrus. During this time herd bulls bugle to keep their cows close by, they also answer the bugles of satellite bulls to let them know they are still dominant. A herd bull will also bugle while approaching a cow in estrus so the cows become familiar with his bugles.
* The first rest phase of the rut occurs between the middle and the end of September. At this time the older cows are predominantly out of estrus and the younger cows have not yet come into estrus. During the rest period, satellite bulls will try to join the herd while the herd bull is resting.
* The second breeding phase of the rut takes place three to four weeks after the first breeding phase. This is due to younger cows coming into estrus, as well as older cows that were not bred on their first estrus cycle coming back into estrus. Herd bulls are less aggressive towards satellite bulls at this phase in the rut due to exhaustion. The second phase of the rut may have the most bugling activity due to the combination of the testosterone levels of the younger bulls rising, and the herd bull still trying to maintain control of the herd.
* The second rest phase of the rut occurs around the middle of October. By this time the original herd bull usually does not have control of the herd, due to a great decline in physical condition. Terry Bowyer states, &quot;Elk were observed feeding in the following percentages of observations: master bulls 24%; bachelor bulls 53%; yearling males 62%; cows 64%; and calves 62%&quot; (Bowyer uses the terms &quot;master bulls&quot; and &quot;bachelor bulls&quot; which have the same meaning as &quot;herd bulls&quot; and &quot;satellite bulls&quot;). Herd bulls do not have time to feed during the rut due to constantly fighting other bulls as well as chasing and breeding cows.
* Occasionally a third breeding phase will occur. This will usually take place around the end of October or early November. This is a result of yearling cows coming into estrus for the first time or two-year-old cows coming into a second estrus cycle. Since most of the herd bulls have left the herd by this time of year, the breeding is usually done by the younger satellite bulls. After this phase the rut is over, most bulls will leave the cows and form bachelor herds to spend the winter with; however young bulls will usually remain with the cows throughout the winter.

===Other deer species===
==== Fallow deer ====
The fallow deer (&quot;Dama dama)&quot; is an ungulate which employs an unusual strategy for mating during the rut. This strategy is the creation of a lek, a display area presented to the females where the males gather and allow the females to choose a mate based upon their traits alone while reducing predation risk, disturbance to copulation, parasite transmission and the cost of looking for a mate. When females come to the lek they leave soon after mating but the males will tend to stay in the lek to court other females until the end of the rutting season. However, male fallow deer which are unsuccessful in mating will leave the lek sooner than other males and they will adopt other strategies to compensate for their lack of mating success in the lek. Furthermore, the duration spent in the lek is positively correlated with the behavioral traits of male display frequency and aggression, male hierarchical position and secondary sex characteristics such as antler size. Overall, lekking species such as the fallow deer have a short intense rutting season where the males face intrasexual competition, territory defense and management of females within their territory.

In elephants, the breeding season is less pronounced than in ungulates and it usually spikes when the rains season occurs or shortly thereafter. The rut is observed in both African and Asian elephants and it is referred to as musth. Its meaning is derived from the Urdu word &quot;mast&quot; meaning intoxication. The most prominent characteristics of an elephant in rut are heightened sexual and aggressive activity along with copious temporal gland secretion and continual urine discharge. Also it has been observed that males will have a higher concentration of testosterone and an increased likelihood of associating with female groups during musth. Similarly to deer or mountain goats, elephants will tusk the ground throwing vegetation, logs and objects into the air and occasionally at subordinates.

== Moose ==
Moose have a series of rutting events that are similar to those seen in other deer species, however, they have several characteristic behaviors which give them a distinct rut. The first of these behaviors is a challenger gait where the bull moose will sway back and forth and circle the rival bull while dipping his antlers down. Another typical behaviour seen in moose especially during the pre-rut stage is mock battling. This is a display meant to scare away other rival males where the bull moose will destroy trees and vegetation prior to engaging in a fight. Also, a behaviour known as displacement feeding is observed in male moose and it refers to the hasty movements made by the moose while it is feeding as it keeps an intense gaze upon rival bull moose. Furthermore, as seen in other deer species male moose will dig mud pits and soak them in urine and the females will fight over possession of these wallows. The pre-rutting season typically begins during August and is marked by bull moose leaving the younger satellite bulls. During this stage there is much mock fighting and the pre-rut ends in September when the bull moose emerge from the solidarity of heavily wooded areas. Then begins the searching stage of the rut where the male seeks the moose cow in estrus and the instances of displacement feeding and tension between rival males increases. Once a potential mate has been found the male enters the display stage of the stage which lasts one to three days. During this time he will court the female by standing sidewise three to five yards from the female moose to show himself as a mate. If successful he will get to mate with her for several days and then move on to a new partner. This pattern of behaviours will then repeat with successive mates until late October or early November. Following the mating season, bull moose spend long hours resting and feeding before forming their usual winter groupings.

Although the battle between males is the main contest, there is also a battle between females. Usually, this occurs between an older cow moose and a younger female. The mature cow will attempt to stop the younger one from coming near to the wallow in a vicious attack with her forelegs and if the younger female gets to lie in the wallow the older female will drive her out of it only to return to lie in it and take up as much space as possible. During this event the bull moose will not interfere and he will just watch in plain sight.

<doc id="749483" wikidata="Q597149" url="?curid=749483" title="The Dæmons">
<text>The Dæmons is the fifth and final serial of the eighth season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in five weekly parts on BBC1 from 22 May to 19 June 1971.

In the serial, the alien time traveller the Master (Roger Delgado) awakens the ancient horned alien Azal (Stephen Thorne) in a cavern beneath an English church, with the Master intending to be granted Azal&#x27;s immense power.

==Plot==

In the village of Devil&#x27;s End, an archaeological dig is excavating the infamous Devil&#x27;s Hump, a Bronze Age burial mound. A local white witch, Olive Hawthorne arrives to protest, warning of great evil and the coming of the horned beast, but she is dismissed as a crank. After watching a television broadcast about the dig the Third Doctor tells Jo that Miss Hawthorne is right – the dig must be stopped, and so the two make preparations to depart.

Miss Hawthorne goes to see the new local vicar, the Reverend Magister who is the Master – he tries to assure her that her fears are unfounded, but his hypnosis fails to overcome her will. Backed by a group of followers, the Master is conducting ceremonies in the cavern below the Church to summon up Azal, a force of evil. The Doctor and Jo reach the mound and the Doctor rushes inside to stop the dig, but it is too late. The tomb door opens and icy gusts of wind rush out, freezing both the leader of the dig and the Doctor, while a stone gargoyle, Bok, seemingly comes alive.

The leader of the dig perishes, but the Doctor somehow recovers, presumably due to his alien physiology. Captain Mike Yates and Sergeant Benton arrive at the village the following morning, but the Brigadier, arriving later, finds himself unable to enter the village, as there is an invisible dome-shaped barrier, 10 miles in diameter and one mile high, surrounding it that causes anything trying to enter to heat up and burst into flame. He contacts Yates and is briefed on the situation while the Doctor and Jo return to the dig where they find a small spaceship in the mound, which has been condensed. From this, the Doctor realises that the Master is trying to conjure up an ancient and all-powerful demon, who is seen on Earth to be the Devil but is an alien. The Doctor explains that the Dæmons have used Earth as a giant experiment throughout its history, becoming part of human myth. The Master has called the Dæmon up once, and right now, it is so small as to be invisible. The third summoning, however, could signal the end of the experiment, and the world.

The Master summons up Azal again and demands to be given the Dæmon&#x27;s power, but Azal warns him that he is not the Master&#x27;s servant. Azal says on his third appearance, he will decide if Earth deserves to continue existing. If so, he will give it to the Master. Azal then vanishes in another heat wave.

The Doctor is captured by a mob of villagers working for the Master. They tie him up to a maypole and plan to burn him alive, but with the help of Miss Hawthorne and Benton he escapes. In the Church cavern Jo and Yates watch as the Master summons Azal one last time. They try to interrupt the ritual but are taken prisoner. As Jo is prepared as a sacrifice to Azal, the Brigadier manages to get through the heat barrier and enter the village. The Doctor manages to avoid Bok, who is guarding the Church and gets into the cavern, where the Master is expecting him. Outside, UNIT troops are held back by Bok.

The Doctor and the Master both try to appeal to Azal but for opposite reasons. The huge, devil-like figure decides to give his power to the Master, and fires electricity at the Doctor to kill him. However, Jo, steps in front of the Doctor, asking Azal to kill her instead. Azal is unable to comprehend this illogical act of self-sacrifice, and his power turns against him, destroying himself and the Church. The Master tries to escape but is captured by the UNIT troops and taken away. The Doctor, Jo, Miss Hawthorne and the UNIT team join the villagers in their May Day celebrations.

==Production==
&quot;The Dæmons&quot; began life as an audition scene for the companion Jo Grant. The audition sequence went on to be written into episode four. Producer Barry Letts was keen to write for the show and decided that a story dealing in black magic would be interesting as well as frightening. Script editor Terrance Dicks had reservations however, stating that people may view it as Satanist, and so it was reworked as strictly scientific with occultist themes. The Master was originally intended to worship the demon in a church setting, standing on an altar. However, owing to fears that this might upset religious viewers, the scenes were reset in a crypt. This was subsequently revised again, and the crypt was called a cavern, although the set resembled a church crypt. Letts initially intended to write the story himself but found himself short of time due to his role as a series producer. His wife suggested a friend of hers, Robert Sloman, who was a playwright and journalist. Together they worked on the script in the evening after work. At the time, however, the BBC frowned upon production staff writing for their series and so Letts and Sloman decided on the pseudonym Guy Leopold - Sloman&#x27;s son and Letts&#x27; middle name respectively. The working title for this story was &quot;The Demons&quot;, which was commissioned on 17 December 1970. The scripts were completed by mid-February 1971 and worked on by Dicks, who had barely completed work on them by the time the story went into pre-production in March.

Director Christopher Barry had worked on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; before, but wasn&#x27;t particularly keen to return as he preferred to concentrate on less genre-specific productions. However, he liked the script due to the rural setting and his interest in archaeology. He would go on to direct for the show many times again, but still listed &quot;The Dæmons&quot; as his favourite, saying it was &quot;a damn good script&quot;.

Much of the serial was filmed on location in Aldbourne, Wiltshire. The location shoot was awarded two weeks of filming, more than double the usual amount at the time, leading to a lot of the finished story being set outside, rather than in the studio. Membury Airfield in Berkshire and Bridge Farm, Ramsbury, were also used briefly as locations. Filming began on 19 April 1971 and saw pleasant, sunny weather for the first week, leading to sudden overnight snow in the second week – causing filming to be delayed. Some episode one scenes were filmed at night – a rarity for the show, although some of these scenes were filmed during daylight with a dark filter put over the camera lens. Other dark indoor scenes were filmed in a disused aircraft hangar at Bridge Farm, Ramsbury. Filming for the serial caused great excitement in Aldbourne, with a lot of the village residents appearing as extras, as well as the Headington Quarry Morris dancers performing dances in episodes four and five.

The cast included David Simeon who himself was from Wiltshire where the story was being filmed. He had previously appeared in the &quot;Inferno&quot; story a year earlier. Comedy actress Damaris Hayman starred throughout the five episodes as Miss Hawthorne in a central role. Hayman herself had an interest in the supernatural and helped out during production as an unofficial adviser. A friend of hers was a practicing witch who had commended the scripts for their accuracy. Veteran British actor Robin Wentworth played Professor Horner. Future television presenter and Sooty puppeteer, Matthew Corbett had a brief role in the final episode as a hooded coven member who objects to the sacrifice of Jo Grant, and was suggested to the production team by friend Katy Manning. Other guest actors in the story include Don McKillop as the pub landlord, John Joyce as Garvin and Stephen Thorne as Azal. Thorne would go on to appear in the show again as costumed villains in &quot;The Three Doctors&quot;, &quot;Frontier in Space&quot; and &quot;The Hand of Fear&quot;.

After three days of studio taping, work on the serial was completed on 16 May 1971, less than a month before transmission of the final episode. This last episode contains footage of a model church being blown up; the scene was realistic enough to lead many viewers to believe that the BBC had blown up a church as part of the filming. The BBC received several letters complaining about this.

The clip of the Brigadier&#x27;s helicopter blowing up as it crashes into the heat shield is borrowed from the James Bond film &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;.

The incantation that the Master uses in summoning Azal is actually the nursery rhyme &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot; said backwards, as well as Damaris Hayman&#x27;s name said backwards.

==Broadcast==
Following the transmission of episode one, the story was discussed by BBC1 controller Paul Fox and Richard Levin, head of television design, who both commended the quality of the script and production. This was a relief to Barry Letts, who due to the extra location filming, had gone over budget on the serial.

The story was repeated on BBC One as a condensed omnibus edition over Christmas 1971 (28 December 1971 at 4.20pm). The Omnibus&#x27;s opening credits gave the title &quot;Doctor Who and the Dæmons&quot; (on the Blu-ray release, the Omnibus opening credits&#x27; title is just &quot;The Daemons&quot;). The closing credits used were for those of episode 5, necessitating the BBC1 continuity announcer naming the cast from earlier episodes. The omnibus repeat achieved higher ratings than the original broadcast, with 10.5 million viewers.

Of the original 625-line PAL colour videotapes, all except Episode Four were wiped for reuse. However, a converted 525-line colour NTSC version recorded off-air from an American broadcast was made available to the BBC. This version was abridged and unsuitable for transmission as it was not of broadcast standard (the US recordings were made on a domestic Betamax VCR from a KCET repeat in 1978). Doctor Who fan Ian Levine tried to retrieve the original NTSC videotapes from KCET, but had discovered that they had been wiped and reused a few weeks before his visit.

In 1992 the colour signal from the NTSC Betamax tapes was used as the basis for restoring the colour to the 16mm monochrome telerecordings of episodes one, two, three and five. These versions were subsequently repeated on BBC2 on consecutive Fridays in November/December 1992 (20 November 1992 to 18 December 1992 at 7.15pm). The ratings were 2.52, 2.96, 2.30, 2.19 and 2.34 million viewers respectively.

Jon Pertwee stated numerous times over the years that this was his favourite &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial. In 1993, Pertwee, along with several members of the cast and crew including Nicholas Courtney, John Levene, Richard Franklin and director Christopher Barry returned to Aldbourne for the Reeltime Pictures reunion documentary &quot;Return to Devil&#x27;s End&quot;. Nicholas Courtney titled his 1998 volume of autobiography &quot;Five Rounds Rapid&quot; after a line from this story:

==Reception==

In 2018, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; ranked &quot;The Dæmons&quot; at number 11 in &quot;the 56 greatest stories and episodes&quot;, describing it as &quot;very much a product of its time&quot; that evoked Hammer Films and also considering it &quot;the quintessential Pertwee story&quot;, noting that it was a particular favourite of the cast. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; concluded that &quot;it may not be one of the greatest stories, but in terms of sheer fun &quot;The Dæmons&quot; is one of the best&quot;. A poll conducted by &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; in 2009 saw it voted the second best story of the Third Doctor&#x27;s era. Arnold T. Blumberg of IGN gave &quot;The Dæmons&quot; a score of 10 out of 10, describing it as &quot;a high point of this Doctor’s time on the show, a classic of the entire series in general, and an amazing document of a particular kind of fantasy horror adventure storytelling so wonderfully &#x27;70s and British that it just never loses its charm&quot;. &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; said that the story was &quot;lavishly filmed and well characterised&quot; and gave particular credit to Roger Delgado as the Master. Although the review was less favourable about the climax to the story, it described the closing scene as &quot;perfection&quot;. 

Reviewing its DVD release, Ian Berriman of &quot;SFX&quot; was more critical, giving it three and a half out of five stars. He derided it for being an &quot;awful mess&quot; with a plot that &quot;doesn&#x27;t make a shred of sense&quot;. Despite praising the &quot;magnificent&quot; characters of Hawthorne, Horner, and Fergus, he thought that other characters including the Doctor and the Master were &quot;continually acting in a completely absurd way&quot;. Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping were also unimpressed by the serial, noting its popularity but stating &quot;&quot;The Dæmons&quot; isn&#x27;t very good. Its denouement is risible, and even the much praised church explosion effect looks cheap.&quot; They did, however, consider the final scene to be &quot;charming&quot;. In &quot;Doctor Who: The Complete Guide&quot;, Mark Campbell awarded it six out of ten, describing it as a &quot;wannabe occult chiller&quot; which &quot;gradually dissipates into a technobabble-filled damp squib&quot;. He regarded the &quot;quintessentially English village&quot; as a &quot;pleasant backdrop&quot; but concluded that &quot;much of the action now seems dated&quot;. In 2010, &quot;SFX&quot; named the resolution to the plot as one of the silliest moments in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; history.

An April Fool spoof report of a suppressed sixth episode was published in the fanzine &quot;DWB&quot; in 1993.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===

A novelisation of this serial, written by Barry Letts, was published by Target Books in October 1974. It was reprinted in 1989 as part of Target&#x27;s Doctor Who Classics range, printed back to back with Terrance Dicks&#x27; novelisation of &quot;The Time Monster&quot;, bound in a metallic cover. There have been Dutch and Portuguese language editions. An unabridged reading of the novelisation by author Barry Letts was released on CD in August 2008 by BBC Audiobooks.

The script of this serial, credited to Robert Sloman and Barry Letts edited by John McElroy, and titled , was published by Titan Books in October 1992.

===Home media===
The final episode of this story was also issued as a black and white film recording on the VHS release &quot;The Pertwee Years&quot;, along with the final episodes of &quot;Inferno&quot; and &quot;Frontier in Space&quot;. In 1993, the episodes with restored colour (see &quot;Broadcast and reception&quot;, above) were released on VHS. A DVD of the serial was released on 19 March 2012, featuring improved sound and picture restoration. The DVD included an audio commentary, on-screen text notes, a retrospective documentary &quot;&quot;The Devil Rides Out&quot; in which cast &amp; crew looked back on the making of the serial, and an obituary documentary &quot;Remembering Barry Letts&quot;&quot; in which family and colleagues looked back over the life and work of the writer/producer/director. The documentary included extensive contributions from Letts himself, from a long interview he conducted with producer Ed Stradling in 2008.
The DVD reached No.3 on the TV-related DVD Chart in the UK, remaining in the top 40 for three weeks. In the overall DVD sales chart it peaked at No.30.

This story, along with the rest of Season 8 was released on Blu-ray on 23 February 2021, to coincide with the 50th Anniversary of The Master. It features a brand new restoration of the film and video materials. According to Mark Ayres, who worked on the restoration, the soundtrack for episodes 1-3 &amp; 5 uses the audio from the 16mm tapes, the NTSC Betamax tapes, and two different UK off-air audio recordings from the original 1971 broadcast in different sections of the restored episodes to get the best quality possible.

<text>The Seraya (also spelled &quot;Saraya&quot;) is a historical building in Nazareth, Israel. It was built around 1740 (or 1730 by the autonomous Arab ruler of the Galilee, Zahir al-Umar, during the Ottoman era in Palestine. Zahir, who later based himself in Acre, used it as a summer home. The Seraya served other functions, namely that of a governmental headquarters for Nazareth, which was an important town in the area and protected the routes and agricultural lands of the Jezreel Valley. The Seraya contained a stable for horses and a jail. Moreover, because of the absence of mosques in Nazareth at the time of the Seraya&#x27;s construction, Zahir designated a prayer room to substitute for a mosque to serve the town&#x27;s Muslim residents. It continued in this capacity until the nearby White Mosque was completed in 1812. 

In 1857, a portico was built for the Seraya, amid other renovations. Later, in the early 20th century, a watchtower, built in the European Renaissance style, was added to the building. With the establishment of the Nazareth Municipal Council in 1877, the Seraya served as the council&#x27;s headquarters until 1991. Prior to that it served as the residence of the local governor of Nazareth and its subdistrict. It is currently in disuse, but the city plans to turn the Seraya into a museum.

<doc id="749492" wikidata="Q284812" url="?curid=749492" title="Samuel Wilson">
<text>Samuel Wilson (September 13, 1766 – July 31, 1854) was an American meat packer who lived in Troy, New York, whose name is purportedly the source of the personification of the United States known as &quot;Uncle Sam&quot;.

==Biography==
Wilson was born in the historic town of Arlington, Massachusetts, (known as Menotomy at the time, township of West Cambridge), to parents Edward and Lucy Wilson. Wilson is a descendant of one of the oldest families of Boston; through direct heritance of his grandfather Robert Wilson, originally from Greenock, Scotland, he was Scottish with a Massachusetts background. As a boy, he moved with his family to Mason, New Hampshire.

===Continental Army===
While living in Mason at the young age of fourteen, Wilson joined the Continental Army on March 2, 1781. His duties while enlisted consisted of guarding and caring for cattle, and mending fences, as well as slaughtering and packaging meat; guarding meat was a priority during the war. It was not uncommon for enemies to tamper with and poison food sources. Wilson&#x27;s service to the Army most likely came to an end around October 19, 1781, with the surrender of Cornwallis at the Siege of Yorktown.

===Move to New York===

In 1789, at the age of 22, Samuel and his older brother Ebeneezer, age 27, relocated, by foot, to Troy, New York. The Wilson brothers were amongst the first pioneer settlers of the community, and Troy was attractive to earlier settlers for its proximity to the Hudson River. Samuel and his brother Ebeneezer partnered together and built several successful businesses. Both were employees of the city as well as successful entrepreneurs.

After his relocation to Troy, Samuel drew upon his prosperous location. He purchased property on Mount Ida (now Prospect Park), closely located to the Hudson River. The combination of natural elements produced exceptional clay, ideal for brick making. This began a new business venture for Samuel Wilson. His bricks were the first native bricks of Troy. Many historical buildings in Troy include bricks made by Wilson. This was revolutionary during the 18th century. Many bricks during this period were imported from the Netherlands.

On March 8, 1793, Samuel and his brother Ebeneezer leased the western half of lot 112, now 43 Ferry Street, from Jacob Vanderhyden for 30 shillings a year. This was the year the Wilson brothers began E &amp; S Wilson, which was the Wilson brothers&#x27; introduction to the profitable meat business. Their slaughterhouse was located between Adams (now Congress) Street and Jefferson Street. The brothers took advantage of their prime location and built a dock at the foot of what is now Ferry Street. Having such access to the Hudson River enabled E &amp; S Wilson to prosper.

===Marriage and children===
Wilson returned to Mason, New Hampshire, in 1797, to marry Betsey Mann, daughter of Captain Benjamin Mann. Samuel and Betsey were parents to four children, Polly (1797–1805), Samuel (1800–1807), Benjamin (1802–59), and Albert (1805–66).

Wilson not only was a pioneer of Troy, he was active in the community, as well as an employee of the city. On April 12, 1808, he took an oath as Office Assessor. Four days later he took an Oath of Office as Path Master (now more commonly known as road commissioner).

===War of 1812===

Wilson&#x27;s career role during the War of 1812 is what he is most noted for today. As troops gathered in camps for equipping and training, the demand for a supply of meat for the troops had significantly increased. Secretary of War William Eustis made a contract with Elbert Anderson Jr. of New York City to supply and issue all rations necessary for the United States forces in New York and New Jersey for one year. Anderson ran an advertisement on October 6, 13, and 20 looking to fill the contract. The Troy, New York firm of Ebenezer &amp; Samuel Wilson secured the contract for 2,000 barrels of pork and 3,000 barrels of beef for one year.

Wilson was subsequently appointed meat inspector for the U.S. Army. His duties included checking freshness and packaging, and ensuring that the barrels were built and packed according to specifications. Each barrel was marked &quot;E.A.-U.S.&quot;, indicating &quot;Elbert Anderson, United States&quot;. The majority of E &amp; S Wilson&#x27;s meat was shipped to a camp of 6,000 soldiers in Greenbush, New York, where soldiers from Troy who were acquainted with Samuel Wilson and his nickname &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; made an association between Wilson and the &quot;U.S.&quot; stamp. Over time, any army property marked U.S. also became linked with Wilson&#x27;s name, and &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; became a figure of speech to describe the United States.

==Historical legacy==
Wilson died July 31, 1854, at the age of 87. He was originally buried in Mt. Ida Cemetery, but later transferred to Oakwood Cemetery in Troy. Monuments mark his birthplace in Arlington, Massachusetts, and site of burial in Troy, New York. A New Hampshire historical marker (number 35) titled &quot;Uncle Sam&#x27;s House&quot; marks his boyhood home in Mason, New Hampshire.

Some scholars have pointed out that Wilson may not have been the original creator of the phrase, but may have had a significant role in spreading the name. While Wilson may or may not have been the original &quot;Uncle Sam&quot;, the 87th United States Congress adopted the following resolution on September 15, 1961: &quot;Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives that the Congress salutes Uncle Sam Wilson of Troy, New York, as the progenitor of America&#x27;s National symbol of Uncle Sam.&quot;

<doc id="749496" wikidata="Q2007168" url="?curid=749496" title="Tom Wilson (record producer)">
<text>Thomas Blanchard Wilson Jr. (March 25, 1931 – September 6, 1978) was an American record producer. He is best known for his work in the 1960s with artists such as Bob Dylan, Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, the Velvet Underground, Cecil Taylor, Sun Ra, Eddie Harris, Nico, Eric Burdon and the Animals, the Blues Project, the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, and others.

==Early life and education==
Wilson was born in Waco, Texas on March 25, 1931, to parents Thomas and Fannie Wilson (&quot;née&quot; Brown). He attended A.J. Moore High School in Waco and was a member of New Hope Baptist Church. Wilson attended Fisk University before transferring to Harvard University, where he became involved in the Harvard New Jazz Society, radio station WHRB, and was president of the Young Republicans. He graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; from Harvard in 1954.

==Career==
After university, Wilson borrowed $500 () to set up Transition Records, having a goal in mind of setting up a record label and recording the most advanced jazz musicians of the day. The label released about a dozen albums, including Sun Ra&#x27;s &quot;Jazz By Sun Ra&quot; (retitled &quot;Sun Song&quot; when reissued in 1968), which was Ra&#x27;s first LP (a second LP of Transition material remained unreleased until 1968), and the album &quot;Jazz Advance&quot; by Cecil Taylor, which was Taylor&#x27;s debut release. Transition also released the first sessions led by Doug Watkins, Donald Byrd, and Herb Pomeroy. The label went bankrupt in 1957 and the catalog was sold off to the Blue Note and Delmark Records. Wilson&#x27;s work with Transition Records helped him obtain a job with United Artists Records in 1957. He worked as a producer for jazz labels, including Savoy Records, for whom he again recorded Sun Ra in 1961.

===Columbia Records===
As a staff producer at Columbia Records, Wilson was one of the &quot;midwives&quot; of folk-rock, producing three of Bob Dylan&#x27;s key 1960s albums: &quot;The Times They Are a-Changin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot;, and &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;, along with the 1965 single, &quot;Like a Rolling Stone.&quot; Wilson also produced the final four tracks Dylan recorded for &quot;The Freewheelin&#x27; Bob Dylan&quot;, after he replaced John Hammond as Dylan&#x27;s producer in 1963.

Wilson produced Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s 1964 debut LP &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.&quot; which included &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;. Seizing on local radio interest in the song in Florida and inspired by the huge success of the Byrds&#x27; folk-rock version of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Mr Tambourine Man&quot;, Wilson took the duo&#x27;s original acoustic track and, without Simon&#x27;s or Garfunkel&#x27;s knowledge, overdubbed electric instruments, turning the track into a #1 pop hit, helping to launch the folk-rock genre. Simon and Garfunkel, who had already split, reunited after the hit and went on to greater success.

After working with Wilson, both Dylan and Simon &amp; Garfunkel worked with another Columbia staff producer, Bob Johnston, who produced several albums for both acts.

===Verve/MGM Records===
In 1966, Wilson signed the Mothers of Invention to Verve Records and was credited as producer on the group&#x27;s debut album &quot;Freak Out!&quot;

Also in 1966, after the Animals split from producer Mickie Most, Wilson became their producer, which continued until the original band broke up in 1967. Wilson also produced the Velvet Underground, featuring Lou Reed and John Cale. Although Andy Warhol is credited as the producer of the group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; (1967), Cale credits Wilson as the true producer, as Warhol was mostly absent from the sessions. Wilson was credited only for the production of the song&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;, which had been released as a single in 1966 prior to the album&#x27;s release. Wilson also produced the Velvet Underground&#x27;s second album, &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; (1968) and was officially credited as that album&#x27;s producer (the band having parted ways with Warhol prior to its recording). Wilson resigned from MGM Records (then owner of Verve) prior to the release of &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; and did not work with the Velvet Underground thereafter.

Another of Wilson&#x27;s Verve production credits was the Blues Project&#x27;s first studio album &quot;Projections&quot; (1966) featuring Al Kooper (with whom Wilson had previously worked on Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;) as vocalist and keyboard player. Wilson co-produced the Soft Machine&#x27;s eponymous first album with Chas Chandler in 1968.

==Achievements==

Wilson was an important producer of the 1960s, alongside his contemporaries (including Phil Spector, George Martin, Jimmy Miller, Brian Wilson, Quincy Jones, Tom Dowd, and Teo Macero). He has been said to have had the skill of &quot;putting the right people together for the right projects&quot;. Grammy-winning producer Ian Brennan (music producer) wrote in Tape Op Magazine, &quot;That an African American man played a massive and pivotal role in three seminal musical forms seemingly dominated by Caucasian artists – folk rock, prog rock, and proto-punk – is one of the most tragically untold stories in popular music’s history.&quot;

Wilson made an important contribution to Dylan&#x27;s rock and roll sound, producing his first rock recordings on &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;. In the 1969 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Interview, Jann Wenner asked, &quot;There&#x27;s been some articles on Wilson and he says that he&#x27;s the one that gave you the rock and roll sound. Is that true?&quot; Dylan: &quot;Did he say that? Well if he said it... [&quot;laughs&quot;] more power to him. [&quot;laughs&quot;] He did to a certain extent. That is true. He did. He had a sound in mind&quot;.

Frank Zappa spoke highly of Wilson, who produced the Mothers of Invention&#x27;s debut album &quot;Freak Out!&quot;:
==Death==
Wilson died of a heart attack in Los Angeles in 1978, aged 47. He was buried at the Doris Miller Memorial Park in McLennan County, Texas.

==In Popular Media==
Wilson appears as a minor character (portrayed by Eric Berryman) in the 2024 Bob Dylan biographical film A Complete Unknown.

<doc id="749504" wikidata="Q1569513" url="?curid=749504" title="Marc Grossman">
<text>Marc Isaiah Grossman (born September 23, 1951) is an American former diplomat and government official. He served as United States Ambassador to Turkey, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, and Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs. He was most recently the United States Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan and is currently a Vice Chairman of The Cohen Group, a business strategic advisory firm headed by former U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen, and a Vice Chair of the German Marshall Fund board of trustees.

== Early life and education ==
Grossman was born in Los Angeles, California on September 23, 1951. He attended the University of California, Santa Barbara and graduated in 1973 with a B.A. in political science. He later received an M.Sc. in international relations from the London School of Economics.

== Diplomatic career ==

=== Early career ===
Grossman served at the United States Embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan, from 1977 to 1979. He served as the Deputy Director of the Private Law Office of Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington, Secretary General of NATO, from 1983 to 1986. Grossman served as Deputy Chief of Mission at the United States Embassy in Ankara, Turkey from 1989 to 1992. From 1993 to 1994, Grossman managed operations for senior State Department leadership as Executive Secretary of the State Department and Special Assistant to the Secretary of State.

=== Ambassador to Turkey ===
Grossman returned to Turkey after being appointed United States Ambassador to Turkey on September 29, 1994. He began his role on January 3, 1995 and left the post on June 1, 1997.

=== Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs ===
Grossman served as Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs from 1997 to 2000 and was responsible for over 4,000 State Department employees posted in 50 sites abroad with a program budget of $1.2 billion. He played a lead role in orchestrating NATO&#x27;s 1999 Washington summit, marking the group&#x27;s 50th anniversary, and helped direct U.S. participation in NATO’s military campaign in Kosovo that same year. While he entered office as the Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, the title of the position was changed to Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs on January 12, 1999.

=== Director General of the Foreign Service ===
From 2000 to 2001, Grossman served as the Director General of the United States Foreign Service and Director of Human Resources. At the direction of the Secretary of State, he revamped the State Department&#x27;s human resource strategies, including the Department&#x27;s strategies for training, assigning, and retaining personnel both at home and abroad.

=== Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs ===
Grossman was appointed Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, the Department&#x27;s third-ranking official, in March 2001. In 2004, Grossman attained the Foreign Service&#x27;s highest rank when the President appointed him to the rank of Career Ambassador. He received the Secretary of State&#x27;s Secretary&#x27;s Distinguished Service Award the following year. Grossman served as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs until his initial retirement in 2005.

=== Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan ===
Grossman was lured out of retirement by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to become the United States Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, an appointment he received following the death of the first Special Representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke. He began his role on February 22, 2011 and concluded his tenure on December 14, 2012.

== Private sector career ==
In January 2005, Grossman resigned from his position and joined The Cohen Group, an advisory firm providing corporate leadership with strategic advice in government regulation and raising capital. Grossman serves as Vice Chairman of the Cohen Group. The Cohen Group has close connections to the Turkish Army and represents some of the US’s largest weapons manufacturers, which stand to benefit from weapons sales to Turkey: Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics and Sikorsky Aircraft among others, and their list of clients includes controversial firms such as DynCorp International, a major national security contractor with the US government, charging billions for overseas military and police training. Through their strategic partnership with DLA Piper, the Cohen Group also serves foreign clients such as the Turkish government and Turkish trade associations, United Arab Emirates, India and Australia’s scandalous AWB. In late 2005, Grossman also joined Ihlas Holding, a Gülen-linked Turkish conglomerate which is also active in several Central Asian countries. Grossman is reported to receive $100,000 per month for his advisory position with Ihlas.

Until 2015, he served as the inaugural Chair of the Board of Advisors of the Master of Science in Foreign Service Program at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, where he serves as a practitioner/faculty member. He is currently a member of the advisory board for DC-based non-profit organization America Abroad Media.

== Personal life ==
Grossman married Mildred Anne Patterson in May 1982. The couple had their first date on November 3, 1979, one day prior to the Iran hostage crisis. They have an adopted daughter, Anne, who was born in Giresun, Turkey. Grossman speaks French and Turkish in addition to English.

<text>William Bauchop Wilson (April 2, 1862 – May 25, 1934) was an American labor leader and progressive politician, who immigrated as a child with his family from Lanarkshire, Scotland. After having worked as a child and adult in the coal mines of Pennsylvania, he became active as a labor organizer.

Wilson is best remembered for his service as the first Secretary of Labor (1913–21) in the United States, serving through the years of American participation in the Great War. President Woodrow Wilson (no relation) nominated him to the office.

==Biography==

===Early life===
William B. Wilson was born in Blantyre, Lanarkshire, Scotland. He was the third child of Adam Black Wilson and Helen Nelson (Bauchop) Wilson, and the first to survive early childhood. His father was a coal miner.

During a mining strike in February 1868, the family was evicted from their company-owned home as the company tried to suppress the strike. His father Adam Wilson traveled around Scotland unsuccessfully trying to find other work. He ultimately decided to emigrate to the United States to find employment there, and left his wife and three children, sailing by ship across the Atlantic in April 1870.

Adam Wilson found work in the bituminous coal region of Pennsylvania, settling in the little town of Arnot, located in Tioga County. After finding a job, he sent for his wife and family. Together with his father-in-law, they departed Glasgow for the United States in August 1870.

Immediately after arriving in the United States, the boy William Wilson was enrolled in public school in Arnot. This interval proved to be short-lived, however, as his father began to suffer serious back problems and was unable to complete his work without assistance. At the age of 9, William was removed from school and sent to help his father in the mines. He continued to work as a miner for nearly two decades.

In 1874, young William engaged in labor organizing for the first time when he attempted to launch a union for the boys who worked as trappers, manually operating the ventilation of the mines. When the fledgling union threatened a strike over a wage reduction, union representative Wilson discovered the limits of union solidarity. He was paddled by a foreman and the incipient strike was broken.

The event proved to be a valuable learning experience for Wilson, who later recalled in his unpublished memoirs:

His argument had been forceful and effective, but it was applied to the wrong part of my anatomy to be permanently convincing... It helped impress upon my mind the fact that until working men were as strong, collectively, as their employers, they would be forced...to accept whatever conditions were imposed upon them.

In 1876, when Wilson was just 14 years old, there was declining membership in the local Miners&#x27; and Laborers&#x27; Benevolent Association. They selected Wilson, the energetic youngster, as the organization&#x27;s Secretary. He began to correspond with other labor activists around the country, laying the groundwork for his career as a trade union organizer and leader.

===United Mine Workers official===
He served as international secretary-treasurer of the United Mine Workers of America from 1900 to 1908.

===House of Representatives===
He was elected as a Democrat from Pennsylvania&#x27;s 15th congressional district to the Sixtieth, Sixty-first, and Sixty-second Congresses. He served as chairman of the United States House Committee on Labor during the Sixty-second Congress. Wilson was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1912 and for election in 1914.

===Secretary of Labor===
He was appointed United States Secretary of Labor in the Cabinet of President Woodrow Wilson and served from March 5, 1913, to March 5, 1921. One of the first efforts he focused on was getting underway the newly created United States Conciliation Service, whose purpose was to provide mediation for labor disputes. During the First World War, he was a member of the Council of National Defense. The administration was working to encourage African-American support for the war effort, both among men who served and those who were working in war industries.

Among his special assistants was George Edmund Haynes, 1918 to 1921, who was the first African American to earn a doctorate from Columbia University. Haynes served as Director of Negro Economics in the United States Department of Labor. Competition was fierce for the higher-paying jobs in the defense industries, and during Red Summer of 1919, whites attacked blacks in numerous cities. Haynes tried to mitigate racial conflict in employment, housing, and recreation. He also continued his earlier work in studying how blacks were excluded from certain trade unions, interracial conditions in the workplace, and issues in child labor.

Wilson was a member of the Federal Board for Vocational Education from 1914 to 1921 and served as chairman of the board in 1920 and 1921. He was appointed on March 4, 1921, a member of the International Joint Commission, created to prevent disputes regarding the use of the boundary waters between the United States and Canada, and served until March 21, 1921, when he resigned.

In December 1916, Wilson addressed a conference on social insurance in which he discussed State developments in that field, such as the provision of mothers&#x27; pensions and workmen&#x27;s compensation, and also spoke of the possibility of the United States introducing old-age pensions and universal health insurance. The Department of Labor had earlier in Wilson&#x27;s term expressed favor towards an invitation to attend an International Conference on Social Insurance.

===Later years and death===
Wilson was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the United States Senate in 1926 against Republican William Scott Vare. After his public service he was engaged in mining and agricultural pursuits near Blossburg, Pennsylvania.

He died on board a train near Savannah, Georgia on May 25, 1934. He was buried in Arbon Cemetery in Blossburg.

===Legacy===

In 2007, Wilson was named to the U.S. Department of Labor&#x27;s Labor Hall of Fame. It is located inside the North Plaza of the headquarters at the Frances Perkins Building on 200 Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, D.C.

<text>Berhampore () is a suburb of Wellington, New Zealand. It lies towards the south of the city, four kilometres from the city centre, and two kilometres from the coast of Cook Strait. It is surrounded by the suburbs of Vogeltown, Newtown, Melrose, Island Bay, Kingston, and Mornington. The suburb was named after Berhampore in Bengal, one of the battlefields at the start of the Battle of Plassey of 1757. Also surrounding Berhampore is the Berhampore Golf Course as well as a very extensive green belt (known as the town belt) with many walkways and tracks connecting outlying areas. The suburb also boasts some of Wellington&#x27;s best all weather sports fields, on Adelaide Road and the national hockey stadium. Alongside the golf course there is a skateboard/bmx park, right by a kids mountain bike track. Berhampore School opened in 1915.

Residents of Berhampore are both ethnically and socio-economically diverse and contribute to the atmosphere of their surrounding communities. Recent traffic calming by Wellington City Council in Adelaide Road and Luxford Street has helped create a more defined sense of community in Berhampore.

The housing stock in Berhampore is a mix of mostly lower to middle value properties, with examples of most building styles and types seen in New Zealand since European settlement. The Berhampore State Flats, located on Adelaide Road, are a fine example of the international style of architecture. They were designed by F. Gordon Wilson, chief architect at the Department of Housing Construction, and completed in 1938–39.

One of the distinctive features of Dexter&#x27;s Inspector Morse novels is the use of quotations as chapter headings, which began in the second novel in the series, &quot;Last Seen Wearing&quot; (1976); then in the fourth, &quot;Service of All the Dead&quot; (1979); and in the sixth, &quot;The Riddle of the Third Mile&quot; (1983) onwards. However, it was not always possible to find suitable quotations for every chapter, so many were simply invented by Dexter and attributed to non-existent sources, the most common of which was Diogenes Small. These appeared in the last five novels of the series: &quot;The Jewel That Was Ours&quot; (1991), &quot;The Way Through the Woods&quot; (1992), &quot;The Daughters of Cain&quot; (1994), &quot;Death Is Now My Neighbour&quot; (1996), and &quot;The Remorseful Day&quot; (1999). Over twenty years, Dexter created a lengthy bibliography for the fictional author, including &quot;Small&#x27;s Enlarged Dictionary&quot;, which apparently ran to at least 18 editions within Small&#x27;s tragically short lifespan.

From time to time, these quotations have appeared elsewhere, such as in newspapers with a &quot;thought for the day&quot; or &quot;humorous quotes&quot; feature, possibly because the contributors admired Dexter&#x27;s conceit, or simply because they accepted the attributions at face value.

<text>Eyre Highway is a highway linking Western Australia and South Australia via the Nullarbor Plain. Signed as National Highways 1 and A1, it forms part of Highway 1 and the Australian National Highway network linking Perth and Adelaide. It was named after explorer Edward John Eyre, who was the first European to cross the Nullarbor by land, in 1840–1841. Eyre Highway runs from Norseman in Western Australia, past Eucla, to the state border. Continuing to the South Australian town of Ceduna, it crosses the top of the Eyre Peninsula before reaching Port Augusta.

The construction of the East–West Telegraph line in the 1870s, along Eyre&#x27;s route, resulted in a hazardous trail that could be followed for interstate travel. A national highway was called for, with the federal government seeing the route&#x27;s importance in 1941, when a war in the Pacific seemed imminent. The highway was constructed between July 1941 and June 1942, and was trafficable by January 1942. It was originally named Forrest Highway, after John Forrest, by the war cabinet. It was officially named Eyre Highway, a name agreed upon by the states&#x27; nomenclature committees.

The finished road, while an improvement over the previous route, still was not much more than a track, and remained such throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Efforts to seal the highway began in Norseman in 1960, with the Western Australian section completed in 1969 and the South Australian section finished in 1976. Further improvement works have been undertaken since the 1980s, including widening and reconstructing portions of the road.

==Route description==
Eyre Highway is the only sealed road linking the states of Western Australia and South Australia. It is one of Western Australia&#x27;s two sealed interstate roads, the other being the Victoria Highway linking Western Australia and Northern Territory. Eyre Highway runs east from Norseman in Western Australia for across the Nullarbor Plain to Ceduna, South Australia. It crosses the top of the Eyre Peninsula as it continues eastwards for , before reaching Port Augusta.

Eyre Highway is part of the National Highway route between Perth and Adelaide, and forms part of Australia&#x27;s Highway 1. It is signed as National Highway 1 in Western Australia, and National Highway A1 in South Australia. The vast majority of the highway is a two-lane single carriageway with a speed limit of , except in and around built-up areas. Road trains (A-double or B-triple) up to are permitted on the Eyre Highway, with Quads up to 49.5 metres (163 feet) between Ceduna and Colona Station turnoff limited to .

The Western Australian section of Eyre Highway is on the western side of the Nullarbor Plain. The South Australian section crosses the eastern section of the Nullarbor Plain, and the top of the Eyre Peninsula. The Nullarbor gets its name from Latin for &quot;no tree&quot;. The typical view on the route is a straight highway and practically unchanging flat saltbush-covered terrain. The Eyre Peninsula has been extensively cleared for agriculture, although there are remnant corridors of native eucalyptus woodland alongside its roads.

Main Roads Western Australia and the Department for Infrastructure &amp; Transport in South Australia monitor traffic volume across the states&#x27; road networks, including various locations along Eyre Highway. In Western Australia, the recorded traffic volumes ranged between 430 and 760 vehicles per day in 2013/14. In South Australia, the estimated annual average daily traffic as of September 2015 varied between 500 and 1,500 vehicles west of Lincoln Highway, and was 2,700 to the east.

=== Safety ===
In 2011, the Australian Automobile Association considered the Eyre Highway to be among the lowest risk highways in the country, based on total number of casualty crashes per length of road. The individual risk based on casualty crash rates per vehicle kilometre travelled was assessed as high for the 95 km section east of Yalata to Fowlers Bay. It was medium for a section from Fowlers Bay to Ceduna, low-medium between Ceduna and Port Augusta, and low west of Yalata.

In 2013, Eyre Highway similarly received a lower safety rating for the South Australian sections, compared to the Western Australian section. Out of five stars, approximately 10% was rated as one- or two-star in Western Australia, generally towards the Norseman end, and 91% was rated three- or four-star. In South Australia, 49% was rated as one- or two-star, mostly from Yalata to Ceduna, and across the Eyre Peninsula, with the remaining 51% rated as three- or four-star.

===Western Australia===
Eyre Highway begins at the town of Norseman, on the Coolgardie–Esperance Highway. Apart from Eucla, from the South Australia border, roadhouses serving the highway are the only settlements on the stretch through Western Australia. These are located apart, at Balladonia, Caiguna, Cocklebiddy, Madura, and Mundrabilla. The section between Balladonia and Caiguna includes what is regarded as the longest straight stretch of road in Australia and one of the longest in the world. The road stretches for without turning, and is signposted and commonly known as the &quot;90 Mile Straight&quot;. Travelling east, the highway descends through the Madura Pass just before the Madura roadhouse from the Nullarbor Plain to the coastal Roe Plains. It skirts the bottom of the escarpment, climbing back through the Eucla Pass just before Eucla.

Because of its remoteness, some widened sections of the highway serve as emergency airstrips for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. These airstrips are signposted, have runway pavement markings painted on the road, and turnaround bays for small aircraft.

===South Australia===
After crossing the border at the settlement of Border Village, the highway passes through the Nullarbor Wilderness Protection Area and through the localities of Yalata, Penong and Ceduna. Before arriving at Ceduna, it enters the Eyre Peninsula. After Ceduna, the highway passes the intersection with Flinders Highway and heads south-east towards Kyancutta. After passing through Wirrulla, Poochera, Yanninee and Wudinna, the highway arrives at Kyancutta where it meets the north end of the Tod Highway.

After Kyancutta, the highway turns to the east towards the town of Kimba. Before arriving at Kimba, it turns to the north-east. After Kimba, the highway passes through the southern end of the Lake Gilles Conservation Park and to the immediate north of both the town of Iron Knob and the Cultana Training Area before meeting the Lincoln Highway. It continues north-east until it intersects with the Augusta Highway and Stuart Highway, north-west of the Joy Baluch AM Bridge which crosses Spencer Gulf at Port Augusta.

An alternative route between Ceduna and Port Augusta, formerly signed Alternate National Route 1 and now signed B100, follows Flinders Highway and Lincoln Highway down the western and eastern sides of the peninsula respectively.

==History==
===Background===

In 1840–1841, Edward John Eyre was the first European to traverse the coastline of the Great Australian Bight and the Nullarbor Plain by land, on an almost trip from Adelaide to Albany, Western Australia.

Three decades later, the East–West Telegraph line was installed. Constructed between 1875 and 1877, it followed the same route across the Nullarbor and along the Great Australian Bight, after John Forrest retraced Eyre&#x27;s route in 1870 and confirmed its suitability. Repeater stations were installed at Port Lincoln, Streaky Bay, Smoky Bay, Fowlers Bay, Eucla, Israelite Bay, Esperance and Bremer Bay. Stations were later added at Franklin Harbour (Cowell) in 1885, Yardea in 1896 and Balladonia in 1897.

From 1912 to 1917 an inland route across the Nullarbor was established with the construction of the Trans-Australian Railway, from Port Augusta via Tarcoola to Kalgoorlie. With few roads or tracks encountering the line, most of it is only accessible by rail.

===Highway planning and construction===

The construction of the telegraph had resulted in a trail that could be followed for interstate travel, but it was a haphazard route which only the more adventurous motorists would take. Many travellers were unprepared for the harsh conditions and lack of services. They would cause a nuisance for station owners and other travellers by scrounging petrol, contaminating water supplies, leaving gates open, and committing acts of vandalism.

In 1938 the Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia (RAC) called for a national highway to be constructed by the federal government, as it would be a strategic defence road, provide another link between Western Australia and other states, and improve the tourist experience. The federal government did not see the road as important enough for its involvement.

In May 1941, following the construction of the central north–south Stuart Highway, the federal government announced its decision to build the east–west highway between Norseman and Port Augusta. A northerly route, close to the Trans-Australian Railway, had been considered, but extensive limestone outcrops made it impractical. Taking a route east from Norseman, with some detours around limestone ridges, would allow a road to be formed quickly and easily. With a war in the Pacific seemingly imminent, construction began in July 1941. The Army was responsible for fuel, food, and communications, while the state government departments of Main Roads (Western Australia) and Highways (South Australia) managed the construction.
The road was completed in June 1942. Construction cost twice the initial £125,000 estimate over a period of four months. The road was sufficiently trafficable and in use by January 1942. The finished road, while an improvement over the previous route, still was not much more than a track. The only sections with a bitumen surface were the Madura and Eucla Passes. The formed width was , with some sections lightly gravelled over a width.

By the middle of the century, several water tanks with up to capacity were located alongside the highway, including at Madura Pass, Moonera, Cocklebiddy, and east of Mundrabilla. In some cases the tanks were accompanied by amenity such as a shed, or a hut and stove, or even petrol and cafes at Ivy Tanks. The establishment of Ivy Tanks in any form was being lost by the 1980s.

===Naming===
In the 1930s and 1940s, the Western Australian Nomenclature Advisory Committee had been choosing directional names for the state&#x27;s main arterial roads, such as Great Eastern Highway. The South Australian Highways Department had been naming the major roads to other states after explorers, such as Flinders Highway, named after Matthew Flinders. In 1938, the historical memorials committee of the Royal Geographical Society in South Australia was disappointed that no road had been named after Eyre, despite its suggestion that the road from Port Augusta towards Perth should be Eyre Highway. In the same year, the RAC suggested that the proposed new highway be named Forrest Highway, after John Forrest. The Assistant Minister for Commerce, Senator Macdonald, concurred.

On 21 January 1942, Prime Minister John Curtin announced the war cabinet decision to name the newly constructed road Forrest Highway, for military purposes. Separately, the states&#x27; nomenclature committees were considering names for the road. A proposal for a single name to be used in both states was put by the Western Australian committee to the South Australian committee when the highway was completed. Two names were suggested: Great Western Highway, in line with similar directional names in Western Australia, and Eyre Highway, after the explorer. After several communications between the committees, both decided to use the name Eyre Highway. After receiving a letter from the South Australian Premier in May 1943, supporting the nomenclature committee&#x27;s recommendation, Curtin agreed to the name, subject to approval from the Western Australian government.

The South Australian section was named Eyre Highway on 20 May 1943, with the portion from Murat Bay (Ceduna) to the state border declared a main road. Eyre Highway was gazetted in Western Australia on 11 June 1943, and included the road from Coolgardie to Norseman until Coolgardie–Esperance Highway was gazetted on 16 August 1957.

===Sealing===

The state of Eyre Highway remained relatively unchanged throughout the 1940s and 1950s. The road received yearly maintenance, but further, more expensive works were not warranted due to the low traffic volume of approximately fourteen vehicles per day. The maintenance and grading was hindered by a lack of rainfall – the road was smoothed out each year, and small sections were gravelled, but the soil the road was made from was too weak to be an effective road surface. When it did rain, even in small amounts, the road would become boggy, from patches that had broken down into a powdery substance, known as &quot;bulldust&quot;, during dry periods. Large numbers of vehicles travelling the highway in 1962, for the Commonwealth Games in Perth, damaged the road in numerous locations, and the lack of moisture required salt water to be pumped from below the surface for use in repairs and maintenance.

Work to seal Eyre Highway was undertaken in the 1960s and 1970s. As the federal government refused requests from Western Australia and South Australia for a special allocation to fund the sealed road, the work was left for the states to finance, over a number of years. Construction began in 1960, at the Norseman end. By the end of that year had been reconstructed, and was ready to be sealed over a width. were sealed in 1961, another were completed by 1963, and in 1964 the seal reached out from Norseman. By the mid-1960s, approximately were being sealed each year. With increased priority given to the project from 1966, Western Australia&#x27;s portion of the highway was completed in 1969, with a ceremony held in Eucla on 17 October.
In South Australia, a decade-long program to seal the highway began in the mid-1960s. The first section completed was the route between Port Augusta and Ceduna, in December 1967. In October 1972 the Ceduna to Penong seal was completed. The final link to be sealed, between Penong and the state border, was completed with a ceremony held in September 1976 near Wigunda Tank, South Australia.

Between Yalata and the state border, the highway was realigned and deviated considerably from the original unsealed route. In deciding the new alignment for the South Australian section of the highway between Yalata and the state border, long, straight, flat sections were purposely avoided to prevent driver boredom and consequent fatigue, as well as sun-glare and glare from oncoming headlights. The new alignment also took into consideration the potential tourism opportunities provided along the coast of the Great Australian Bight.

The older route, Old Eyre Highway, runs from Border Village to the Nullarbor Homestead, approximately away from the coast. Another section from the Nullarbor Homestead to Nundroo Motel also travelled further inland than the new alignment, past Ivy Tank Motel and Yalata Roadhouse.

===Further improvements===
The 1960s standard of a sealed width with gravel shoulders was proving to be inadequate by the 1980s. Increasing numbers of truck and tourist coaches caused fretting, and reduced the actual sealed width to along much of Eyre Highway. Main Roads in Western Australia spent around a million dollars a year on rehabilitating sections. A major project to improve Eyre Highway, rather than just repair the damage, began in 1984 with federal government providing funding to reconstruct in Western Australia.

The highway was rebuilt with a pavement, with shoulders partially sealed to a width of . Work began in mid-1985 near Cocklebiddy, with a section completed in 1986. Work undertaken from 1987 to 1988 reached out east of Cocklebiddy, and had been completed by June 1990. The upgrade from Cocklebiddy to the state border was completed in October 1994.

Since the 1990s, regular maintenance and minor improvements have been an ongoing effort. There have been larger-scale works including reconstruction of sections near Caiguna, Balladonia, and the Frazer Range in Western Australia, as well as Cungena and Kyancutta in South Australia.

<doc id="749539" wikidata="Q112501" url="?curid=749539" title="Revolt of the Three Feudatories">
<text>The Revolt of the Three Feudatories, () also known as the Rebellion of Wu Sangui, was a rebellion lasting from 1673 to 1681 in the early Qing dynasty of China, during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661–1722). The revolt was led by Wu Sangui, Shang Zhixin and Geng Jingzhong, the three ethnic Han lords of Yunnan, Guangdong and Fujian provinces whose hereditary titles were given to them for defecting to and helping the Qing dynasty conquer China proper, who rebelled after the Qing central government started abolishing their fiefs. The feudatories were supported by Zheng Jing&#x27;s Kingdom of Tungning on the island of Taiwan, which sent forces to invade Mainland China. Additionally, minor Han military figures, such as Wang Fuchen, and the Chahar Mongols, also revolted against Qing rule.

Due to their history as defectors that helped to topple the Southern Ming dynasty, the Three Feudatories failed to win over the support of the general Han populace and were eventually defeated by the Qing forces. After the last remaining Han resistance had been put down, the former princely titles were abolished.

==Background==
After the Qing dynasty from Manchuria conquered China proper, during the reign of the Shunzhi Emperor (1643–1661), the central government&#x27;s authority was not strong enough to control the provinces in southern China directly. The government initiated a policy of &quot;letting the Han Chinese govern the Han Chinese&quot; (以漢制漢). Some generals of the former Ming dynasty who had surrendered to the Qing were allowed to help govern the provinces in the south.

That was the result of the crucial contributions those generals had made at decisive moments during the Qing conquest of China. For instance, the navy of Geng Zhongming and Shang Kexi brought about the quick capitulation of Joseon in 1636, allowing rapid advance into Ming territories without worrying about what was behind. The defection and subsequent cooperation of Wu Sangui allowed swift capture and settlement of the Ming capital Beijing. In return, the Qing government had to reward their achievements, and acknowledge their military and political influence.

In 1655, Wu Sangui was granted the title of &quot;Pingxi Prince&quot; (平西王; &quot;West Pacifying Prince&quot;) and granted governorship of the provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou. Shang Kexi and Geng Zhongming were granted the titles of &quot;Pingnan Prince&quot; and &quot;Jingnan Prince&quot; (both mean &quot;South Pacifying Prince&quot;) respectively, and were put in charge of the provinces of Guangdong and Fujian. The three lords had great influence over their lands and wielded far greater power than any other regional or provincial governors. They had their own military forces and had the authority to alter tax rates in their fiefs.

==The Three Feudatories==

In Yunnan and Guizhou, Wu Sangui was granted permission by the Shunzhi Emperor to appoint and promote his own personal group of officials, as well as the privilege of choosing warhorses first before the Qing armies. Wu Sangui&#x27;s forces took up several million taels of silver in military pay, taking up a third of the Qing government&#x27;s revenue from taxes. Wu was also in charge of handling the Qing government&#x27;s diplomatic relationships with the Dalai Lama and Tibet. Most of Wu&#x27;s troops were formerly Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong&#x27;s forces and they were well-versed in warfare.

In Fujian province, Geng Zhongming ruled as a tyrant over his fief, allowing his subordinates to extort food supplies and money from the common people. After Geng&#x27;s death, his son Geng Jimao inherited his father&#x27;s title and fiefdom, and Geng Jimao was later succeeded by his son Geng Jingzhong.

In Guangdong province, Shang Kexi ruled his fief in a similar fashion to Geng Jingzhong. In total, much of the central government&#x27;s revenue and reserves were spent on the Three Feudatories, and their expenditure emptied almost half of the imperial treasury. When the Kangxi Emperor came to the throne, he felt that the Three Feudatories posed a great threat to his sovereignty and wanted to reduce their power.

In 1667, Wu Sangui submitted a request to the Kangxi Emperor, asking for permission to be relieved of his duties in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, on the premise that he was ill. Kangxi, not yet ready for a trial of strength with him, refused Wu&#x27;s request. In 1673, Shang Kexi asked for permission to retire, and in July, Wu Sangui and Geng Jingzhong followed suit. Kangxi sought advice from his council on the issue and received divided responses. Some thought that the Three Feudatories should be left as they were, while others supported the idea of reducing the three lords&#x27; powers. Kangxi went against the views of the majority in the council and accepted the three lords&#x27; requests for retirement, ordering them to leave their respective fiefs and resettle in Manchuria.

==Declaring rebellion==
In December 1673, Wu Sangui ended his connection to the Qing dynasty and instigated the rebellion under the banner of &quot;opposing Qing and restoring Ming&quot; (反清復明). Wu courted Han Chinese officials to join the rebellion by restoring Ming customs and cutting off queues.

Wu&#x27;s forces captured Hunan and Sichuan provinces. In 1674 both Geng Jingzhong in Fujian and after Shang Zhixin, the man who massacred Guangzhou, died, his son followed suit in Guangdong. At the same time, Sun Yanling and Wang Fuchen also rose in revolt in Guangxi and Shaanxi provinces. Zheng Jing, ruler of the Kingdom of Tungning, led an army from Taiwan and landed in Fujian and Guangdong to fight and join the rebel forces.

Wu entrusted the 5th Dalai Lama to negotiate with the Kangxi Emperor about dividing China along the Yangtze, with Wu ruling the south and Qing retaining the north, but the Emperor refused. Later on in 1678, he declared a new dynasty, the Zhou, invoking the name of the great pre-imperial dynasty.

==Composition of Qing armies==

The Qing forces were initially defeated by Wu in 1673–1674. Manchu Generals and Bannermen were put to shame by the performance of the Han Chinese Green Standard Army, who fought better than them against the rebels. The Qing had the support of the majority of Han Chinese soldiers and the Han elite, as they did not join the Three Feudatories. Different sources offer different account of the Han and Manchu forces deployed against the rebels. According to one, 400,000 Green Standard Army soldiers and 150,000 Bannermen served on the Qing side during the war. according to another, 213 Han Chinese Banner companies, and 527 companies of Mongol and Manchu Banners were mobilized by the Qing. According to a third, the Qing mustered a massive army of more than 900,000 northern Han Chinese to fight the Three Feudatories.

Fighting in northwestern China against Wang Fuchen, the Qing put Bannermen in the rear as reserves while they used Han Chinese Green Standard Army soldiers and Han Chinese Generals like Zhang Liangdong, Wang Jinbao, and Zhang Yong as their main military force. The Qing thought that Han Chinese soldiers were superior at fighting other Han people and so used the Green Standard Army as their main army against the rebels instead of Bannermen. As a result, after 1676, the tide turned in favor of the Qing forces. In the northwest, Wang Fuchen surrendered after a three-year-long stalemate, while Geng Jingzhong and Shang Zhixin surrendered in turn as their forces weakened.

==Campaigning==

In 1676 Shang Zhixin joined the rebellion, consolidating Guangdong under his rule and sending troops north into Jiangxi.

In 1677, Wu Sangui suspected Sun Yanling would surrender to the Qing in Guangxi and he sent his relative Wu Shizong, to assassinate Sun. Sun&#x27;s wife Kong Sizhen took control of his troops after his death, although she may already have had control beforehand.

In the south, Wu Sangui moved his armies north after conquering Hunan, while the Qing forces concentrated on recapturing Hunan from him. In 1678, Wu finally proclaimed himself emperor of the Great Zhou Dynasty (大周) in Hengzhou (衡州; present-day Hengyang, Hunan province) and established his own imperial court. However Wu died of illness in August (lunar month) that year and was succeeded by his grandson Wu Shifan, who ordered a retreat back to Yunnan. While the rebel army&#x27;s morale was low, Qing forces launched an attack on Yuezhou (岳州; present-day Yueyang, Hunan province) and captured it, along with the rebel territories of Changde, Hengzhou and others. Wu Shifan&#x27;s forces retreated to the Chenlong Pass. Sichuan and southern Shaanxi were retaken by the Han Chinese Green Standard Army under Wang Jinbao and Zhao Liangdong in 1680, with Manchu forces involved only in dealing with logistics and provisions, not combat. In 1680, the provinces of Hunan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and Sichuan were recovered by the Qing, and Wu Shifan retreated to Kunming in October.

In 1681, the Qing general Zhao Liangdong proposed a three-pronged attack on Yunnan, with imperial armies from Hunan, Guangxi and Sichuan. Cai Yurong, Viceroy of Yun-Gui, led the attack on the rebels together with Zhang Tai and Laita Giyesu, conquering Mount Wuhua and besieging Kunming. In October, Zhao Liandong&#x27;s army was the first to break through into Kunming and the others followed suit, swiftly capturing the city. Wu Shifan committed suicide in December and the rebels surrendered the following day.

Zheng Jing&#x27;s forces were defeated near Xiamen in 1680 and forced to withdraw to Taiwan. The final victory over the revolt was the Qing conquest of the Kingdom of Tungning on Taiwan. Shi Lang was appointed as admiral of the Qing navy and led an invasion of Taiwan, defeating the Tungning navy under Liu Guoxuan in the Battle of Penghu. Zheng Jing&#x27;s son Zheng Keshuang surrendered in October 1683, and Taiwan became part of the Qing Empire. Zheng Keshuang was awarded by the Kangxi Emperor with the title &quot;Duke of Haicheng&quot; (海澄公) and he and his soldiers were inducted into the Eight Banners.

==Aftermath==
Shang Zhixin was forced to commit suicide in 1680; of his thirty six brothers, four were executed when he committed suicide, while the rest of his family was allowed to live. Geng Jingzhong was executed; his brother Geng Juzhong was in Beijing with the Qing court with the Kangxi Emperor, during the rebellion, and was not punished for his brother&#x27;s revolt. Geng Juzhong died of natural causes in 1687. Several Ming princes had accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan in 1661–1662, including the Prince of Ningjing, Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu Honghuan (朱弘桓), son of Zhu Yihai. The Qing sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives in exile since their lives were spared from execution.

In 1685, the Qing used former Ming loyalist Han Chinese naval specialists who had served under the Zheng family in Taiwan in the siege of Albazin. Former Ming loyalist Han Chinese troops who had served under Zheng Chenggong and who specialized at fighting with rattan shields and swords (Tengpaiying) 藤牌营 were recommended to the Kangxi Emperor to reinforce Albazin against the Russians. Kangxi was impressed by a demonstration of their techniques and ordered 500 of them to defend Albazin, under Ho Yu, a former Koxinga follower, and Lin Hsing-chu, a former General of Wu Sangui. These rattan shield troops did not suffer a single casualty when they defeated and cut down Russian forces traveling by rafts on the river, only using the rattan shields and swords while fighting naked.
&quot;[the Russian reinforcements were coming down to the fort on the river] Thereupon he [Marquis Lin] ordered all our marines to take off their clothes and jump into the water. Each wore a rattan shield on his head and held a huge sword in his hand. Thus they swam forward. The Russians were so frightened that they all shouted: &#x27;Behold, the big-capped Tartars!&#x27; Since our marines were in the water, they could not use their firearms. Our sailors wore rattan shields to protect their heads so that enemy bullets and arrows could not pierce them. Our marines used long swords to cut the enemy&#x27;s ankles. The Russians fell into the river, most of them either killed or wounded. The rest fled and escaped. [Lin[ Hsing-chu had not lost a single marine when he returned to take part in besieging the city.&quot;, written by Yang Hai-Chai, who was related to Marquis Lin, a participant in the war
==Literature==
The revolt is featured in Louis Cha&#x27;s novel &quot;The Deer and the Cauldron&quot;. The story tells of how the protagonist, Wei Xiaobao, helps the Kangxi Emperor suppress the rebellion.

<doc id="749543" wikidata="Q313710" url="?curid=749543" title="Thomas Ravelli">
<text>Thomas Ravelli (; born 13 August 1959) is a Swedish former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. His 21-year professional career was almost exclusively associated with Öster and Göteborg, for whom he appeared in a combined 416 Allsvenskan games. The most-capped player for the Sweden national team for several years, Ravelli represented the nation at the 1990 and 1994 FIFA World Cups, and UEFA Euro 1992.

==Club career==
Ravelli was born in Vimmerby where he lived his first five years of life. After a shorter stint in Åtvidaberg the family settled in Växjö. At the club level he played for Östers IF and IFK Göteborg, winning three Allsvenskan championships during his ten-year tenure with the former team before signing for the latter in 1989, at the age of 29.

With Göteborg, Ravelli conquered a further six leagues and his only Swedish Cup. In 1998, already 39, he joined the Tampa Bay Mutiny of Major League Soccer, closing out his career the following year with his first club; in total, he played in nearly 500 official matches as a professional.

==International career==
Ravelli&#x27;s international career spanned almost two decades, starting in 1981. He played in the 1990 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 1992, and the 1994 World Cup, with Sweden finishing third in the latter tournament, and appeared in a total of 143 games. The 1994 World Cup semi-final against Brazil was Ravelli&#x27;s 116th game for Sweden, overtaking Björn Nordqvist&#x27;s appearances record.

He is well known for saving two penalties during the shootout against Romania in 1994 World Cup&#x27;s quarter-final clash, including one in the &quot;sudden death&quot; by Miodrag Belodedici (5–4 win). This feat led to him finishing second in the year&#x27;s race for &quot;Goalkeeper of the Year&quot;, behind Belgian Michel Preud&#x27;Homme, and he was also named by France Football as the seventh best player in Europe.

==Style of play==
Extroverted, experienced and highly competitive with a tall and slender frame, known for his leadership and vocal presence in goal in spite of his eccentric and temperamental personality, Ravelli was a traditional, consistent and efficient goalkeeper with solid all-round fundamentals, who was regarded in particular for his positional sense and ability to read the game and organise his defence; considered to be a world-class player in his position in his prime, as well as one of Sweden&#x27;s greatest goalkeepers ever, he also possessed good elevation and shot-stopping abilities, which enabled him to produce acrobatic saves without having to resort to histrionics, and was known for his command of his area and speed when rushing off his line, as well as his ability to close down his opponents and get over the ball quickly. He also stood out for his longevity throughout his career; however, he also came into criticism at times from his managers over his poor work-rate in training.

Although Ravelli was not known to be a penalty-saving specialist, Ravelli drew attention to himself in the media when he stopped two penalties in Sweden&#x27;s quarter-final penalty shoot-out victory over Romania at the 1994 World Cup.

Ravelli was also known for his temperament among teammates, and he was also known to be a prankster, at one point cutting holes into Martin Dahlin&#x27;s underwear.

==Personal life==
Ravelli&#x27;s twin brother, Andreas, is also a former footballer. Their father, Dr. Peter Ravelli, was an Austrian immigrant of Italian descent who moved to Sweden in 1952, and the siblings played alongside each other at Öster and the national team.

Ravelli participated as a celebrity dancer in Let&#x27;s Dance 2019, broadcast on TV4.

<text>The Ruta Quetzal (also called Aventura 92 and Ruta BBVA in different stages) is an education and cultural exchange project for young people directed by the famous Spanish adventurer Miguel de la Quadra-Salcedo and continued by his son, Íñigo. The programme was created in 1979 at the suggestion of King Juan Carlos I of Spain. The objective of this program was to consolidate the foundations of the Ibero-American Community of Nations among the youth of all Spanish-speaking countries.

Throughout its 43 years of life (32 editions), the Ruta Quetzal managed to unite more than 12,000 young people and travelled to more than 20 countries, always following in the footsteps of crucial figures in the history of the Ibero-American Community. This initiatory expedition, in which education in values, culture and adventure were mixed, was directed by Miguel de la Quadra-Salcedo. With a period of six years without continuity, in 2022, his son, Íñigo de la Quadra-Salcedo, took it back the project with a new expedition to celebrate the commemorations of the Way of Saint James (Camino de Santiago) in Spain.

He is currently preparing the Expedition 2023 entitled Towards the Light of the End of the World.

The Ruta Quetzal was attached to the Secretariat of State for International Cooperation and Ibero-America of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Spain, and was sponsored by the Ibero-American General Secretariat (SEGIB). The programme was also declared of national interest by more than 30 countries, was endorsed by the European Union, and was declared a cultural programme of &quot;Universal Interest&quot; by UNESCO in 1990.

==History==
In 1979, Miguel de la Quadra-Salcedo, Quetzal Route director since the beginning of the &quot;Ruta&quot; (as it&#x27;s called by the routers), proposed to the king Juan Carlos I of Spain his idea to form a trip for teenagers from Spain, Latin America and other countries of Asia and Europe, one which would promote intercultural exchange between the youth of Spanish speaking countries, as well as youngsters from more than 50 countries. Half of the students come from the Iberian Peninsula, around a quarter from Latin America, and the remainder from Europe and Asia.
That same year, the expeditions began.

Until the early 21st century the expeditions were led by Miguel de la Quadra-Salcedo.

Each year, youths from more and more countries become eligible to participate. In 2008, 360 students from 56 countries participated, including the 2 newest countries China and Bulgaria.

==Other information==
Many different routes have been travelled through the years. Usually, the students chosen to take the trip are among the best in Spain, Portugal, and many of the countries that form Latin America. 
The selection process usually consists of an invitation to submit an original piece of historical, literary, artistic or musical work covering one of several pre-designated topics, followed by an interview.

In 1997 the Ruta Quetzal went to Spain and Mexico.

During the 2002 expedition the Ruta Quetzal was in Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Costa Rica and Spain.

<text>Gerabronn () is a small town in the county of Schwäbisch Hall, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. In 2006 it had a population of about 4,547 and covered an area of 40.38 km2.

Gerabronn is the home town of the two leading German politicians of the Green Party: Joschka Fischer and Rezzo Schlauch.

==History==
Gerabronn developed from a village, which was supposedly founded in the 10th century. Originally named &quot;Gerhiltebrunnen&quot; (well of Gerhilt), it was also called Gerolzbrunn, Geroldbrunn, Gerltbrunn or Gerhartsbrunn, until in the 17th century the current name became common. The village was first mentioned in a 1226 feud letter, when the area came under the control of the Bishop of Würzburg.

Until the 19th century Gerabronn was only a village; thereafter it became a town (&quot;Oberamtsstadt&quot;) in 1811 it was responsible for the administration of the surrounding area. Industrialization and a connection to the railway further helped the growth of the town. In 1938 the &quot;Amt&quot; was dissolved and became part of the county of Crailsheim, which in 1972 was included into the county of Schwäbisch Hall. In 1972–75, the previously independent municipalities of Amlishagen, Dünsbach and Michelbach/Heide, as well as Ober- and Unterweiler from the municipality of Wittenweiler, were included into the town.

==Overview==
Gerabronn lies in 422 up to 460 meters height on a hill on the Hohenlohe Plain.

Neighbouring municipalities

The town borders in the north on Blaufelden, in the east on Rot am See, in the south on the towns of Kirchberg an der Jagst and Ilshofen and in the west on Langenburg.

City Districts

From 1972 until 1975, the municipalities of Amlishagen, Dünsbach and Michelbach/Heide as well as Oberweiler und Unterweiler from the municipality of Wittenweiler were annexed following the municipal reform.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms shows the quartered black-and-white shield of the Hohenzollern family, who were the Viscounts of Nürnberg when the coat of arms was granted to the town in 1545. To distinguish the coats of arms of the family and the town two vaulting horses were added, as horse breeding was popular in the town historically. Originally the horses were displayed on the black quarters, but in 1902 they were placed on the silver quarters, the design being made official in 1953.

==Sons and daughters of the town==
* Joschka Fischer (born 1948), politician (Alliance 90 / The Greens), Federal Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor 1998-2005

<doc id="749563" wikidata="Q6565036" url="?curid=749563" title="List of British regional nicknames">
<text>In addition to formal demonyms, many nicknames are used for residents of the different settlements and regions of the United Kingdom. For example, natives and residents of Liverpool are formally referred to as Liverpudlians, but are most commonly referred to as Scousers (after their local dish). Some, but not all, of these nicknames may be derogatory -especially those exchanged by post-industrial towns too close to each other. Many derive from sports clubs, especially football ones. Involved demonyms tend to attract offensive parodies, for example &quot;Bumholian&quot; for &quot;Dundonian&quot; (an inhabitant of Dundee). Owing to the oral nature of the tradition, much of it (but not all) lower-class, citations are haphazard.

<text>François Marie Daudin (; 29 August 1776 in Paris – 30 November 1803 in Paris) was a French zoologist.

==Biography==
With legs paralyzed by childhood disease, he studied physics and natural history but ended up being devoted to the latter.

Daudin wrote &quot;&quot; (Complete and Elementary Treatise of Ornithology) in 1799–1800. It was one of the first modern handbooks of ornithology, combining Linnean binomial nomenclature with the anatomical and physiological descriptions of Buffon. While an excellent beginning, it was never completed.

In 1800, he also published &quot;Recueil de mémoires et de notes sur des espèces inédites ou peu connues de mollusques, de vers et de zoophytes&quot; (Collection of memories and notes on new or little-known species of molluscs, worms and zoophytes).

Daudin found his greatest success in herpetology. He published &quot;Histoire naturelle des reinettes, des grenouilles et des crapauds&quot; (Natural history of tree frogs, frogs and toads) in 1802, and &quot;Histoire naturelle, générale et particulière des reptiles&quot; (Natural History of Reptiles) (8 volumes) in 1802–1803. This latter work contained descriptions of 517 species, many for the first time, based on examining over 1100 specimens.

He was assisted by his wife &quot;Adèle&quot; (Adélaïde Geneviève de Grégoire de Saint-Sauveur, born 1774), who drew the illustrations. Although his books were commercial failures the couple did not live in poverty, due to the family fortune. She died of tuberculosis in late 1803, and he followed shortly thereafter, also of tuberculosis, not yet 30 years old.

<text>Eversource Energy is a publicly traded, Fortune 500 energy company headquartered in Hartford, Connecticut, and Boston, Massachusetts, with several regulated subsidiaries offering retail electricity, natural gas service and water service to approximately 4 million customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.

Following its 2012 merger with Boston-based NSTAR, Northeast Utilities had more than 4,270 circuit miles of electric transmission lines, 72,000 pole miles of distribution lines, and 6,459 miles of natural gas pipeline in New England.

On February 2, 2015, the company and all its subsidiaries rebranded themselves as &quot;Eversource Energy&quot;. The stock symbol changed on February 19, 2015, from &quot;NU&quot; to &quot;ES&quot;.

== Corporate structure ==
Before its rebranding, the company operated six main subsidiaries: Connecticut Light and Power (CL&amp;P), Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH), Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO), Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas), NSTAR Electric, and NSTAR Gas. NSTAR itself was the product of corporate mergers, and included the former Boston Edison Company, Cambridge Electric Light Company, Commonwealth Electric Company, Commonwealth Gas, and Cambridge Gas Company. All now currently operate under the Eversource name.

Eversource remains Connecticut&#x27;s largest electric utility, serving more than 1.2 million residential, municipal, commercial and industrial customers in approximately 149 cities and towns.

Eversource is also New Hampshire&#x27;s largest electric utility, serving over 500,000 customers, including homes and businesses, in 211 cities and towns throughout the state.

Furthermore, Eversource is a major energy distributor to 1.7 million customers across Massachusetts, including over 1.4 million electric customers in 140 communities and over 300,000 natural gas customers in 51 communities.

== History ==

The Rocky River Power Company, formed in 1905 by J. Henry Roraback, became the Connecticut Light and Power Company in 1917. Eversource predecessor Northeast Utilities (NU) was formed on July 1, 1966, under CEO Lelan Sillin, with the merger of the Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&amp;P, formed in 1917), Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO, formed in 1886), and the Hartford Electric Light Company (HELCO, formed in 1878) under a single parent company, creating the first new multi-state public utility holding company since the enactment of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. In 1967, Holyoke Water Power Company (HWP) (formed in 1859) joined the NU System. Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH, formed in 1926), a private company at the time, declared bankruptcy in January 1988 due to problems obtaining a license for the completed Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant. and in 1992 was merged into Northeast Utilities.

In 1999, Con Edison and Northeast Utilities entered negotiations that would have created one of the largest utilities in the United States. However, Con Edison backed out of the merger in 2001 after Connecticut&#x27;s Attorney General Richard Blumenthal threatened lawsuits to block it.

Legislation passed in the late 1990s deregulated the electricity market in New England and required regulated utilities to divest generating stations to competitive suppliers. In 1999 the company divested all of the generating assets of WMECO and CL&amp;P per requirements of the Massachusetts and Connecticut legislation. The company retained some of these assets by transferring them to a new subsidiary called Northeast Generation which functioned as a competitive supplier and sold the other assets entirely: WMECO&#x27;s West Springfield Generating Station and several related hydroelectric and fossil fuel generating units were sold to Con Edison, while other assets (most notably the Northfield Mountain hydroelectric facility) were transferred to Northeast Generation.

In 2001, NU sold the assets and operations of its subsidiary, the Holyoke Water Power Company, to the City of Holyoke including the HWP electrical distribution system and customer base and all generation with the exception of the Mt. Tom coal-fired power plant which NU retained. The city&#x27;s municipal gas and electric department assumed responsibility for the generators and absorbed the HWP distribution customer base. Between 2000 and 2002 due to state laws, NU divested WMECO, CL&amp;P, and PSNH&#x27;s nuclear generating assets which consisted of their stakes in the Seabrook, Millstone, and Vermont Yankee stations.

In November 2005, the company announced it would sell its unregulated competitive businesses, including generation and energy services. In November 2006 the company had essentially completed the divestiture of its competitive businesses.

In 2006, NU decided to sell the generating units it had earlier retained in the 1999 divestiture as competitive suppliers and shut down its competitive generation business units. The Northeast Generation assets, including Mount Tom Station and Northfield Mountain, were all sold to Energy Capital Partners. PSNH continued to operate regulated hydroelectric and fossil fuel generation assets to serve its default/basic service customers who did not choose an alternative competitive supplier.

In October 2010, Northeast Utilities announced that it would merge with NSTAR, the major electric and gas provider in Greater Boston, with the resulting company retaining the Northeast Utilities name for the next several years. After government approvals, the deal closed in April 2012.

In 2015 the company (now known as Eversource) agreed to sell all of its New Hampshire generation assets in the same manner it sold its assets in Massachusetts and Connecticut between 2000 and 2006. The sale of the New Hampshire generation fleet was approved by the state&#x27;s Public Utilities Commission on November 29, 2017, and completed on January 10, 2018.

In June 2017 Eversource announced its merger with Aquarion Water Company for $1.675 billion. Aquarion would become a fully owned subsidiary and retain its own name, adding 300 employees and 230,000 customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. In December 2017, the merger was completed after government approval.

In 2016, Eversource started joint ventures for wind farm developments with Ørsted. In 2023, Eversource announced it would sell off its equity in these projects (Bay State Wind, South Fork Wind, Revolution Wind, and Sunrise Wind) at an expected loss of $200 million.

== Major projects ==

Eversource Energy has participated in a number of projects to improve the reliability of the power grid in southwest Connecticut. The first project was construction of the $350 million 345 kilovolt Bethel–Norwalk transmission line through the western part of the state, and was constructed entirely by the company when it was still known as Northeast Utilities.

With United Illuminating, an upgrade to the 69-mile (112 km), 345 kilovolt Middletown-Norwalk transmission line was energized in 2009 at a cost of $900 million.

In 2013, the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, a component of the ongoing New England East-West Solution, was energized at a cost of $795 million. The project addressed numerous reliability issues with the Springfield, MA area&#x27;s 115 kV transmission system by constructing two new 345 kV lines to the Agawam substation; one line north to Ludlow and the other south to North Bloomfield, Connecticut.

The new 345 kV corridor added a new strong interface between Massachusetts and Connecticut. The project also involved rebuilding all of the 115 kV lines along the transmission corridor between South Agawam and Ludlow to increase their capacities, building a new 115 kV transmission substation in East Springfield (Cadwell), replacing the Fairmont 115 kV transmission substation in Chicopee with a new substation across the street, and configuring a new 115 kV line from South Agawam to Southwick using a combination of both new and old line segments of the former 115 kV path between Agawam and North Bloomfield. The new Cadwell and Fairmont switching stations allowed a number of three-terminal 115 kV lines to be broken up into two-terminal lines. Finally, the project allowed a problematic underground 115 kV transmission path through the city of Springfield that was vulnerable to thermal overloads to be removed from service by breaking it in half at the middle. The underground lines now function solely to supply the distribution load served out of the Breckwood substation in Springfield. A previously proposed costly project that would have replaced the underground cables is no longer necessary. On November 20, 2013, cutover of 115 kV lines to the new Fairmont Switching Station was complete, marking substantial completion of the GSRP.

Eversource has taken action to support the use of electric vehicles. Starting in 2018, the company began spending $45 million over five years to install over 400 electric vehicle charging stations in Massachusetts. The project is part of the company&#x27;s Grid Modernization plan. The company has switched much of its power source from coal to natural gas, wind, hydroelectricity and solar power.

==HVDC transmission (&quot;Northern Pass&quot; Project)==
As Northeast Utilities, the company signed on a joint venture with Hydro-Québec and NSTAR to build a new high-voltage direct current (HVDC) line from Windsor, Quebec (connecting with the Quebec grid) to a location in Franklin, New Hampshire. It was projected that the line would either run in an existing right-of-way adjacent to the HVDC line that runs through New Hampshire, or it would connect to a right-of-way in northern New Hampshire that would run through the White Mountains. This 180- to 190-mile line, projected to carry 1,200 megawatts, would have carried electricity to approximately one million homes. The issue of buying hydropower from Hydro-Québec had been an issue during the Massachusetts gubernatorial election of 2010. In November 2015, the Sierra Club of New Hampshire also expressed opposition for the new line, saying that it would not only benefit Connecticut and Massachusetts residents more than those in New Hampshire, but also the concern of the flooding of boreal forests during the construction of Hydro-Québec&#x27;s dams in northern Quebec, disputes with the Innu First Nations, and the effects of tourism and the environment within the White Mountain National Forest.

On January 25, 2018, Massachusetts Governor Baker selected this &quot;Northern Pass Transmission&quot; (NPT) project as the winner for a clean energy procurement RFP.

However, days later on February 1, 2018, the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee voted unanimously to deny Eversource&#x27;s controversial Northern Pass project a permit, leaving the future of the project, and $1.6 billion of Eversource&#x27;s Transmission Rate Base Growth Projections in doubt.

On July 26, 2019, Eversource Energy announced that it was giving up Northern Pass after the New Hampshire Supreme Court rejected its appeal and sided with the SEC.

== Transmission controversy (FERC Complaint) ==
While Eversource reported that its electric transmission earnings were up 80 percent in Q2 2015, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is now investigating the utility for having transmission rates that appear to be “unjust, unreasonable and unduly discriminatory or preferential”. Meanwhile, the potential for rooftop solar to prevent the need for new transmission lines is growing and Eversource wants to cap rooftop solar growth in the state.

== Political connections ==
In 2015, Eversource fought the rooftop solar industry and supported anti-solar policies. In Massachusetts, they staffed the State House with lobbyists in order to end legislation promoting growth of the solar industry. During the 2015 legislative session in New Hampshire, Eversource opposed an increase to the state&#x27;s solar net metering cap. New Hampshire&#x27;s cap is lower than all neighboring states.

Eversource disclosed on its website politically related organization expenditures of $110,000 to the Democratic Governors Association in 2016, and payments made to trade associations that were used for lobbying or other political activities in excess of $135,000.

== Rate hikes and solar charges ==
In Massachusetts, Attorney General Maura Healey testified in March, 2017 before the DPU urging it to deny Eversource&#x27;s proposed $300 million rate increase. In her testimony, she challenged the need for Eversource&#x27;s rate increase, noting NSTAR&#x27;s and WMECo&#x27;s high returns over the last few years. Referencing NSTAR&#x27;s 2015 return of more than 13 percent, Attorney General Healey told the DPU that “[l]ast year, no state public utility commission in the country allowed a return that high.” Between 2010 and 2015, Eversource&#x27;s shareholders of common stock received a cumulative total return (including quarterly dividends and the change in the market price per share) of 89 percent.

On November 30, 2017, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities on Thursday approved a much-reduced rate hike for Eversource Energy that will allow it to charge its Massachusetts electric customers tens of millions of dollars more a year. On December 20, 2017, Attorney General Maura Healey appealed the DPU ruling in the Eversource rate case, specifically the DPU&#x27;s approval of a costly 10 percent shareholder return, one of the highest rates allowed by an electric distribution company regulator in the last five years.

On January 30, 2018, Massachusetts Rep. Thomas Golden and Sen. Michael Barrett held an Oversight Hearing on the DPU&#x27;s decision to approve Eversource&#x27;s proposal to include a demand charge as part of a monthly minimum reliability contribution on net metering customers. Rep. Golden accused the utility of purposefully making the new charges &quot;as confusing as possible.&quot; He said, &quot;Let me tell you something gentlemen, I&#x27;m not happy how this was rolled out. I&#x27;m not happy with the lack of information my office has received.&quot; Golden, co-chairman of the Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy, helped write the 2016 law that permits utilities to levy a new minimum monthly charge, and he told Eversource executives they were making it &quot;extremely, extremely difficult&quot; for him to continue to support them in the policy.

== Price manipulation controversy ==
In 2017, an environmental group accused Eversource and Avangrid of driving up electric, gas rates over several winters by buying up shipment capacity on a major pipeline that they ultimately did not use. The Environmental Defense Fund said both utilities routinely reserved big deliveries of natural gas on the Algonquin pipeline system for frigid days, but then sharply reduced those orders too late in the day for others to use that capacity. Those orders had the effect of driving up wholesale prices for natural gas during peak winter heating periods and in turn increasing the costs of electricity generated by gas-fired power plants. The two utilities “engaged in behavior that would tend to have the largest impact on prices,” said N. Jonathan Peress, a senior director at the New York-based environmental group. “That implies they knew their efforts would have some sort of pricing impact that would provide them with some commercial benefit.” Representatives for both utilities denied they did anything improper.

Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey is reviewing the findings, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to open an investigation on the matter, and both the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority and the Massachusetts Public Utilities Department are launching inquiries of their own.

On Feb. 27, 2018, FERC announced their investigation “revealed no evidence of anticompetitive withholding of natural gas pipeline capacity on Algonquin Gas Transmission by New England shippers.” It said that following an extensive review Commission staff “determined that EDF’s study was flawed and led to incorrect conclusions about the alleged withholding.”

A class-action lawsuit filed on November 14, 2017, against Avangrid, Inc. and Eversource Energy claims the two companies caused electricity consumers to incur overcharges of $3.6 billion in a years-long scheme that impacted six states and affected 14.7 million people. The lawsuit states that 7.1 million retail electricity customers and an overall population of 14.7 million people have been affected by Eversource and Avangrid&#x27;s “unique monopoly” spanning at least from 2013 to 2016. On June 10, 2019, the case was thrown out of court as the judge stated natural gas prices are federally regulated and could not be interfered with by the court.

<doc id="749582" wikidata="Q7903559" url="?curid=749582" title="Uunijuusto">
<text>Uunijuusto () is a Finnish dish made from cow&#x27;s colostrum, the first milk of a calved cow, salted and baked. Sometimes &quot;uunijuusto&quot; is also made from ordinary milk and eggs. In Sweden, the dish is named &quot;kalvdans&quot; (calve&#x27;s dance).

The word &quot;uunijuusto&quot; literally means &quot;oven cheese&quot;, but &quot;uunijuusto&quot; is not properly a cheese.

&quot;Uunijuusto&quot; is sometimes eaten for dessert with berries (often cloudberries) or jam or &quot;mehukeitto&quot;, a soup made from fresh berries such as lingonberries or redcurrants.

<text>Windows Chat (not to be confused with Microsoft Comic Chat) is a simple LAN-based text chatting program included in Windows for Workgroups and, later, the Windows NT-line of operating systems, including Windows NT 3.x, NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 and also Windows 95. In later Windows versions, the Network DDE service may need to be enabled to receive calls. It utilizes the NetBIOS session service and NetDDE. Users can chat with each other over an IPX LAN. The shortcut to the executable is not present in the Start Menu in newer versions of Windows; it must instead be run by using Start &gt; Run... &gt; WinChat.exe.

Windows Chat utilizes a split screen user interface similar to UNIX talk. Windows Chat is real time text, with typing being transmitted immediately.

Microsoft removed the application from Windows versions from Vista on, with the removal of NetDDE, though the program and the DDE service it needs may be manually installed. However the application can still be used through programs such as virtual machines if earlier versions of Windows are installed on them.

<text>John McCrea (born 1966) is a comic book artist best known for his collaborations with writer Garth Ennis.

==Career==
In 1989, after a few years of drawing television and toy tie-ins, he illustrated Ennis&#x27;s debut, the political series &quot;Troubled Souls&quot;, in &quot;Crisis&quot;, as well as its sequel, the farce &quot;For a Few Troubles More&quot;. He later illustrated the series &quot;Carla Allison&quot; in &quot;Deadline&quot;.

He broke into American comics in 1993, drawing Ennis&#x27;s run on DC Comics&#x27;s &quot;The Demon&quot;, followed by its spin-off, &quot;Hitman&quot;, from 1996 to 2001, on which McCrea developed a versatile drawing style equally at home with goofy humour, action, and subtle characterisation. Hitman issue 34 won the Eisner Award for Best Single Issue in 1999. His wilder, more exaggerated cartooning found an outlet with &quot;Dicks&quot;, a mini-series spinning off from &quot;For a Few Troubles More&quot; into more outrageous dialect, sexual and toilet humour, published by Caliber in 1997, with a sequel, &quot;Dicks II&quot;, from Avatar in 2002.

Since &quot;Hitman&quot; finished he has drawn a variety of characters for DC, Marvel, Dark Horse Comics, 2000 AD and others. Recent work includes &quot;Herogasm&quot; and &quot;Highland Laddie&quot;, limited series spun off from Garth Ennis&#x27; &quot;The Boys&quot;, and &quot;The Boys&quot; story arc &quot;Barbary Coast&quot;.

On 9 April 2011, McCrea was one of 62 comics creators who appeared at the IGN stage at the Kapow! convention in London to set two Guinness World Records, the Fastest Production of a Comic Book, and Most Contributors to a Comic Book.

In 2012, he started work on the Mars Attacks! 50th anniversary relaunch of the ongoing comic, written by John Layman and published by IDW. He also contributed 15 new cards to the Topps MA! Heritage set and exclusive variants for the set.

While pencilling and inking the MA! comic, he has also found time to pencil and ink issue 49.1 of &quot;Deadpool&quot; for Marvel, &quot;Warpaint&quot; (written by Phil Hester) for UK based Strip Magazine and &quot;Progenitor&quot; (also written by Hester) for David Lloyd&#x27;s bold new online only publishing adventure &quot;Aces Weekly&quot;.

He returned to DC briefly in 2013 through their Vertigo imprint for an 8 pager (written by Neil Kleid) for their one shot &quot;Ghosts&quot;. He returned again, this time to mainline DC Comics, for miniseries &quot;Section 8&quot;, based on supporting characters of &quot;Hitman&quot;. &quot;Section 8&quot; also marks his reunion with &quot;Hitman&quot; writer Garth Ennis and the team&#x27;s return to the series.

<doc id="749628" wikidata="Q620860" url="?curid=749628" title="Mount Unzen">
<text>is an active volcanic group of several overlapping stratovolcanoes, near the city of Shimabara, Nagasaki on the island of Kyushu, Japan&#x27;s southernmost main island.

In 1792, the collapse of one of its several lava domes triggered a megatsunami that killed 14,524 people in Japan&#x27;s worst volcanic-related disaster. The volcano was most recently active from 1990 to 1995, and a large eruption in 1991 generated a pyroclastic flow that killed 43 people, including three volcanologists.

Its highest peaks are at and at . The latter emerged during the eruptions of the early, eponymous Heisei era (1989–2019).

== Overview ==
Mount Unzen (or ) rises in the central part of the Shimabara Peninsula, Nagasaki Prefecture. It is located on the outer ring of the Chijiwa Caldera centering on Tachibana Bay in the west of the peninsula. It consists of a total of more than 20 mountains, however, the complexity in the shape of was expressed by various numbers (such as Mitake Goho/Mimine Godake as &quot;24th peak&quot;, or Yatsuha as &quot;36th peak&quot;). As a result, the usage of only eight mountains (sometimes three mountains) was coined in a narrow sense, but historically it is a name that refers to the entire mountain range towering over the sea. It is often confused with the name of the oldest peak, .

Surrounding the highest peak of (), are (), (), (), (), (), and (). and derive magma from the Chijiwa Caldera. In other words, it is supplied from a magma chamber beneath Tachibana Bay off Obama Onsen. The main peak is , but the volcanic activity from 1990 (Heisei 2) to 1995 (Heisei 7) made , which was higher in elevation. is also the highest peak in Nagasaki Prefecture.

Unzen originally read &quot;onsen&quot; in the notation of a hot spring, but it was changed to the current notation when it was designated as a national park. An army radar base was built near the summit of Fugen-dake during the Pacific War, where about 100 people were stationed.

==Eruptive history==

=== Prehistoric to October 1990 ===
Mount Unzen is part of the Shimabara Peninsula, which has seen extensive volcanism over millions of years. The oldest volcanic deposits in the region date from over 6 million years ago, and extensive eruptions occurred over the whole peninsula between 2.5 and 0.5 million years ago.

The origins of the Unzen complex are traced to the formation of a graben through crustal faulting. This caused parts of the peninsula to subside by up to below sea level and may have caused eruptive activity to localize at one site inside the graben. Eruptions of dacitic lava began from a site slightly to the south of today&#x27;s Mount Unzen and migrated north over time.

The volcano rapidly grew during its first 200,000 years, forming a very large cone. Later eruptions over the following 150,000 years filled in much of the graben. Initially, activity was dominated by blocky andesitic lava and ash flows, changing to dacitic pumice flows and airfall deposits from 500,000 to 400,000 years ago. The period from 400,000 to 300,000 years ago saw the emplacement of large areas of pyroclastic flow and lahar deposits; these form the major part of the volcanic fan surrounding the volcano. Beginning 300,000 to 150,000 years ago, thick phreatomagmatic deposits were laid down, suggesting the subsidence of the volcano into its graben was rapid during this period.

Activity from 150,000 years ago to the present has occurred at a number of sites around the volcanic complex, building four main domes at different times: the No-dake (70–150,000 years old), Myōken-dake (25–40,000 years old), Fugen-dake (younger than 25,000 years old) and Mayu-yama (4,000 years old) volcanic peaks. Fugen-dake has been the site of most eruptions during the past 20,000 years and lies about from the center of Shimabara.

In December 1663, Fugen-dake erupted, producing lava flows that covered forest for over an extension of . In the spring of the following year, there was a flood from the Kujuku Island crater, located on the southeastern flank of Fugen-dake at an altitude of . More than 30 were killed.

Unzen&#x27;s deadliest eruption occurred in 1792, beginning with an earthquake in November of the previous year. On February 10, 1792, eruptions from Fugen-dake&#x27;s Jigokuato crater began. Lava flows began on March 1 and continued for nearly two months. On March 22, volcanic plumes were produced, and lava also flowed out of the crater. On March 25, fumes rose and lava flowed down the northeastern part of Fugen-dake at a total length of . Eventually, the east flank of the Mayu-yama dome collapsed unexpectedly following a post-eruption earthquake, creating a landslide into Ariake Bay. This caused a tsunami that killed an estimated 15,000 people. it is the worst volcanic related eruption in Japan.

===November 1990 to May 1991===

After 1792, the volcano remained dormant until it erupted again in November 1990.

It started with a slowly building active phase in 1968, with first earthquake swarms continuing until 1975. Large amounts of volcanic gas were ejected by Fugen, which affected about thirty cedar trees. In 1975, bird and animal carcasses were found in the surrounding area, and high concentrations of carbon dioxide were detected emitting from rock fractures. This area was also reported to have erupted volcanic gasses during the 1792 eruption. Earthquakes occurred sporadically from 1975, but there were 89 sensitive earthquakes, with strong shaking equivalent to a maximum seismic intensity of 5 from June to September 1979. At Shimabara Onsen, there was a place where the dissolved carbon dioxide concentration rose sharply from 1975 and increased by 30%. From April 1984, swarms occurred in Tachibana Bay. A magnitude 5.7 earthquake with a seismic intensity of 5 occurred in August near the south side of Hayama. As a result of this earthquake, uplift of the Shimabara Peninsula was observed, and magma supply from Tachibana Bay began.

In November 1989, an earthquake swarm began about underneath and west of Fugen-dake. Over the following year, earthquakes continued, and their hypocentres gradually migrated towards the summit. Finally on November 17, 1990 (Heisei 2), the first phreatic, or steam-blast, eruptions began ejecting from two places near a shrine at the summit. These eruptions only allowed vaporized hot water and ash to blow up from the two craters. In December of the same year, the volcano&#x27;s state lulled and it seemed that it would end, but it erupted again on February 12, 1991, and on April 3 and 4. The eruption intensified on May 9.

On May 15, the first debris flow caused by accumulated volcanic ash at the summit occurred, and a number of cracks were formed on the west side of the crater, extending in an east–west direction. After this inflation of the summit area, fresh lava was confirmed to be emerging on May 20, 1991. The lava was so viscous that it did not flow out, but instead became a dome which formed in the crater. The lava dome grew like a peach, eventually splitting and collapsing into four pieces under its own weight. After that, the dome continued to grow, continuously supplied with fresh lava from the crater underneath, creating new lobes that hung down from the summit. The 1st to 13th lobes were named in the order they were formed. Collapsing of the lava dome began to occur when the lobes, pushed out by the newly supplied magma, started to give way on the slope, causing a phenomenon known as pyroclastic flows (in which debris and volcanic gasses flow down the mountainside at speeds of 100 km/h).

=== June 3, 1991 eruption disaster===
The threat of further disastrous events prompted authorities to evacuate 12,000 residents from their homes. On June 3, 1991, the volcano erupted violently, possibly as a result of depressurisation of the magma column after a landslide in the crater. A pyroclastic flow triggered by the collapse of a lava dome reached from the crater and claimed the lives of 43 scientists and journalists, including volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft and Harry Glicken.

====Before the eruption====
The first debris flow in the Mizunashi River (located at the foothills of Unzendake) occurred on May 15, and others continued to occur in succession on the 19th, 20th, and 21st. Shimabara City made an evacuation recommendation to the towns in the Mizunashi River basin each time, resulting in smooth evacuation of residents and no human fatalities.

However, on May 20, when the lava dome appeared on Fugen-dake, it continued to grow day by day, and on May 24 part of the dome collapsed and the first pyroclastic flow occurred. After that, small pyroclastic flows occurred frequently, reaching a distance of east of the lava dome on May 26, and on May 29. On May 26 when the tip of a pyroclastic flow approached from the nearest private houses, Shimabara City issued an evacuation recommendation for Kita-Kamikoba town, Minami-Kamikoba town, Shirataki town, Tenjin Motomachi, and Fudan Motomachi – all located in the Mizunashi River basin. The evacuation recommendation was carried out without trouble.

In order to capture the pyroclastic flow activity on film, the mass media chose a select spot within the evacuation advisory area. This spot was away from the lava dome, away from the Mizunashi River (where debris flows were frequent), and high. This shooting spot was located on the prefectural road in the village of Kita-Kamikoba, and was favored by the media because they were able to view Fugen-dake directly in front of them. The nickname &quot;fixed point&quot; was established. After the first pyroclastic flow on May 24, more than a dozen media members were lined up at the &quot;fixed point&quot;. In 1991, the media had started to use color photographs on the paper, and with the Fugen-dake disaster becoming an ongoing topic of coverage, the companies started competing for color photographs. The competition became even more intense as the Mainichi Shimbun succeeded in shooting nightly pyroclastic flows on May 28.

The fact that pyroclastic flows were being recorded in clear images for the first time attracted a great deal of attention from all over the world, and many volcanologists and government officials entered the evacuation advisory area for interviews and photography. On May 28, the Ministry of Construction (at that time officials of the Public Works Research Institute) released a picture taken when entering the path of previous pyroclastic flows below the lava dome, and another group on the afternoon of June 1 or 2. After entering the tip of the deposit path, they surveyed the site for about an hour, photographed the pattern and released it.

In addition, many visitors had begun to gather around Unzendake to see the plumes. In particular, since June 2 was Sunday, many visitors from other prefectures gathered around the Mizunashi River and observed the pyroclastic flows with binoculars and photographed them with video cameras. Traffic became heavy as a result.

However, on May 26, reporters from the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; were warned that it was likely for them to be engulfed by the clouds, and in an evacuation recommendation, they were asked to leave the &quot;fixed point&quot; and find another area. According to a photographer who continued aerial photography of the lava dome from the helicopter, &quot;The bottom fans out from the Sabo dam of the Mizunashi River, and if a large pyroclastic flow occurs, there is a strong possibility of it striking the &#x27;fixed point&#x27;.&quot; The &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; abandoned their position and retreated past the Tsutsuno bus stop, to instead set up a point in Fukae Town outside the evacuation zone on May 28, and switched to 24-hour shooting from there. At the &quot;fixed point&quot;, the coverage in the vicinity was limited to patrols.

Similarly, the Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) stopped shooting from within the evacuated area from the end of May and arranged for an unmanned camera in the Kamikoba area. But until the unmanned camera was ready, the photographer who had been lowered backwards was advanced to the Kamikoba area once again on June 1. The evacuation area then became smaller, since the commercial broadcasters had shot footage of bright red lava on May 30 and 31; the person in charge of the news program (who ordered the initial retreat of the front-line shooting staff) ordered more images shot like it. Kamikoba soon emerged again as a filming location of the press.

From May 15, when the debris flow evacuation advisory was issued, the fire brigade in charge of the Kamikoba district stayed either at the Minami-Kamikoba town fire brigade, or the Kita-Kamikoba town agricultural training center (which was initially an evacuation residence for locals). On May 29, due to the frequent occurrences of pyroclastic flows, they were evacuated from the firefighting station in Minami-Kamikoba town to the Shiratani Public Hall in the lower Mizunashi River, but on June 2, they returned to the Agricultural Training Center in Kita-Kamikoba town. This was because of the following reasons:

* Due to the temporary lull in rainfall, the occurrence of debris flow became more sparse, and it was judged that the area where the pyroclastic flows came out was a steep area and did not reach a gentle slope downwards. The evacuation for Tenjin Motomachi and Fudano Motomachi was lifted on the 1st, as well as Shiratani. Therefore, the fire brigade were no longer allowed to stay in the towns downstream from the Kamikoba area, as the evacuation advisories were now canceled.
* On May 29, preparations for the rainy season were resumed, and so was the removal of sediment from the Mizunashi River. But wire sensors that were installed to detect occurrences of debris flows were cut off on May 26 in a series of pyroclastic flows, and recovery of them was still expected to occur. As a result, it was decided to manually monitor the upstream part of the Mizunashi River. The agricultural training center in Kita-Kamikoba was favored for this, as it was located higher than the Minami-Kamikoba fire station.
* On June 2, several reports from a press conference by the Director General of Shimabara, detailed several TV station crews breaking into homes without permission, borrowing telephones and power outlets, and littering in the area. Also, after May 26, residents would often return to recover personal belongings from their homes, or enter the Kamikoba area to do housework or farm work, and it was considered necessary to guide their evacuation in the event of an emergency. As a result, it was convenient for the agricultural training school (which was close to the &quot;fixed point&quot;) to monitor the behavior of the press and warn any nearby locals of danger.

On Sunday, June 2, all 20 members of the Kamikoba area fire brigade slept at the agricultural training institute. They remained at the training center and were on alert.
==== Eruption and Pyroclastic flows ====
After 3:30 pm on June 3, small and medium-sized pyroclastic flows occurred frequently, and the first large-scale pyroclastic flow occurred at 3:57. Although this pyroclastic flow (and its resulting pyroclastic surge) did not reach the &quot;fixed point&quot;, visibility in the vicinity deteriorated significantly as volcanic ash from the dispersing cloud covered the surroundings, in addition to the rainfall that had continued from the morning.

At 4:08 pm, the second large pyroclastic flow occurred, descending the Mizunashi River Valley and reaching to the east from the lava dome. Although the main body of the flow continued to follow the river, the resulting pyroclastic surge spread out in a fan shape once it had exited the valley mouth and continued further, hitting Kita-Kamikoba town ( away from the lava dome) and finally stopping near the Tsutsuno bus stop ( away). The pyroclastic flow also flowed down the Akamatsu-dani River, but changed direction due to a gust of wind from the south, allowing the residents, firefighters, and the shooting staff (who left their camera behind to capture world-famous footage of the eruption) to immediately escape the eruption.

At the &quot;fixed point&quot;, members of the media initially left their chartered taxis and company cars on the road with their engine running, facing south so that they could escape immediately in case of an unforeseen event. However, the field of view was poor due to dispersing ash from the previous pyroclastic flow, as well as due to the presence of rain, and it was almost impossible to evacuate even from the windward side, as the pyroclastic surge that flowed from the Akamatsu-dani River would have cut them off. A fire brigade member of the agricultural training station, several hundred meters away from the &quot;fixed point&quot;, assumed incorrectly that the roaring of the pyroclastic flow was caused by a debris flow instead, and was engulfed by the pyroclastic surge when he left the training station to check the Mizunashi River. Many members escaped from the evacuation advisory area on their own, but suffered severe burns and airway damage. As a result, 16 members of the media (including part-time students), three volcanologists (the Kraffts and Harry Glicken), 12 firefighters who were on guard, four taxi drivers, two police officers who came by police car to conduct evacuation guidance, two workers who were removing the city council election poster bulletin board, and four residents who were working in agriculture were killed. The disaster resulted in 43 dead or missing, and nine injured. The photographer of the &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; newspaper died holding his Nikon F4. The camera recorded seven frames of the pyroclastic flow, although it was discolored by heat. All of the areas surrounding the &quot;fixed point&quot; where many casualties occurred, were within the advised evacuation zone.

A professional video camera used by an NTV cameraman who died in the pyroclastic flow was discovered in June 2005. The camera melted due to the high temperature generated by the pyroclastic flow and was severely damaged, but the tape it contained was playable, despite having been buried under volcanic deposits for almost 15 years. The video received from the camera shows the reporters observing the first pyroclastic flow, and then continuing to report after having moved their position to the &quot;fixed point&quot;. It also displays the police cars that announced evacuation, all unaware of the approach of the second large pyroclastic flow. The footage and sound were recorded and recovered, although heavily damaged and warped (the video ends when the cameraman notices a sound apparently associated with the generating pyroclastic flow, and asks &quot;What&#x27;s that sound?&quot;, whilst turning the camera in the direction of Mt. Fugen). This video was broadcast on October 16, 2005, and is now exhibited at the Unzendake Disaster Memorial Hall (Shimabara City) alongside the melted camera.

It is unclear as to what caused the unprecedented size of the second, large-scale pyroclastic flow on June 3. It has been suggested that the heavy ash-laden column that towered over the main flow, collapsed during its descent, causing the surge. It has also been pointed out that when the dome collapsed, 0.5 million cubic meters of hardened lava broke off, leaving a significant collapse scar afterwards, suggesting that the size of the dome collapse (rather than the column collapse) initiated the surge. Other explanations account the fact that previous lahars and pyroclastic flows filled the Mizunashi Valley, raising the level of the river-bed and making it more likely for the flow to &quot;skip&quot; ridges that would have once stopped it. According to the 2011 documentary (French for &quot;Facing the Killer Volcano&quot;), the unexpected surge could have been caused by phreatic explosions as the main body of the pyroclastic flow proceeded down two waterfalls at the headwaters of the river, fragmenting the ash-particles of the avalanche and expanding the energy of the overlaying gas and ash cloud.

==== Effects and aftermath ====
Pyroclastic flows continued over the next few days following the June 3 eruption, however, they were reportedly smaller and less frequent. Even so, rescue efforts and movements to recover the bodies of the victims, were disrupted and stalled due to the ever-present danger. Authorities eventually managed to recover 27 bodies and brought them to the Anyoji Temple. Four of the victims&#x27; bodies were never recovered, and were reported as missing at the time, but presumed dead. Many of the recovered bodies were carbonized due to the extreme heat of the surge, and were identified by either dental records, or personal belongings they carried with them (e.g. wristwatches or cameras). Seventeen victims on the outer edges of the affected zone lived for a while, before succumbing later to their injuries (burns to their skin and lungs, or inhaled ash in their windpipe and lungs).&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams 2001 https://archive.org/details/survivinggaleras00stan/page/125 125&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The final victim reportedly died on August 8.

The collapse of the lava dome itself left a notable scar on the eastern side of the summit, and the pyroclastic flow and surge resulted in much damage in the Kamikoba district. Kita-Kamikoba was almost completely destroyed. Around 170 houses were devastated, many of them set alight by the intense heat of the ash. Pictures have shown that the pyroclastic flow left significant deposits near the mouth of the Mizunashi River Valley, enough to bury houses and the river itself. In contrast, the surge that detached from the flow left deposits of ash between thick, however trees were flattened and many buildings continued burning until the next morning. The force of the surge was enough to push a car down-road.

Many of the casualties of the June 3 eruption could have been avoided if the danger of pyroclastic flows had been made more apparent beforehand. While the first pyroclastic flow on May 24 was shocking, many did not understand just how lethal such events could become. A reporter stated at the time: &quot;I knew they were quite hot, but didn&#x27;t know they could be accompanied by (pyroclastic surges). I thought we could escape by car, but I didn&#x27;t know the extent at which it burned.&quot;

Twenty-five days after the event, the Japan Meteorological Agency revealed that while the first dome collapse was reported, much of the mass media and local residents were in a state of confusion about the danger of pyroclastic flows, and were not particularly concerned about them overall. The media originally reported that the pyroclastic flows seen on Fugen-dake at the time were &quot;geologically small&quot;, which many regarded as &quot;a scale that would cause no human fatalities&quot;. On May 26, a construction worker operating a Sabo dam in the upstream area of the Mizunashi River was caught in a pyroclastic flow; he survived but was sent to hospital with burns on his arms. Many thought that such burns could be prevented by wearing a long-sleeved shirt. The danger of the phenomena was not made clear. Furthermore, the number of pyroclastic flows from May 25 to June 2 had increased to 165, and all had stopped near the Sabo dam in the upper reaches of the valley. As a result, much of the media grew accustomed to the eruptions and no longer felt like they were in any danger.

Shimabara City issued an evacuation advisory for the villages near the base of Unzen on May 26, but responded to the residents&#x27; request that patrolling police officers allow them into the area to return to their homes (in preparation for prolonged evacuation). From the same day onward, a &quot;district name sticker&quot; was issued, and private cars with such a sticker were given permission to enter the evacuated area. For this reason, there were many residents doing laundry and field work at homes in the zone that had been declared dangerous. In the Kamikoba area, in particular, there were many farmers who made a living by cultivating tobacco leaf, but since they had been forced to evacuate for a long time (since the May 15 debris flows), their work grew stagnant and many of them were concerned. For this reason, on June 4, in collaboration with tobacco farmers in Annaka Town (which had not been evacuated), the residents of the Kamikoba area entered the evacuation zone to perform flower filling work later than usual.

Volcanologists did not talk about the danger of pyroclastic flows initially, because they feared residents would panic, especially those still working in the evacuated area. Residents were warned not to enter the evacuation advisory area by Shimabara City and the media, but since May, no concrete image was given regarding the danger of pyroclastic flows compared to that of debris flows (which had caused significant damage previously), and most residents did not take the warnings seriously. Many misunderstood them to be mere clouds of dust. According to the &quot;Investigation of Disaster Information Transmission and Residents&#x27; Responses during the 1991 Unzendake Eruption&quot; conducted in 1992, 75% of local residents recognized debris flows as more dangerous than pyroclastic flows before June 2. Only 15% perceived pyroclastic flows to be more dangerous. Furthermore, only 5% of the residents in the Kamikoba area recognized pyroclastic flows as &quot;very dangerous&quot;. As was seen in the survey results, the volcanologist&#x27;s warnings were not even understood by residents living in the most dangerous areas.

On June 3, a debris flow warning was passed out due to rain that began in the morning, and a party was held in Shiratani to celebrate the winner of the Shimabara City Council election on June 2. As a result of those two factors, most residents were withdrawn from the evacuation advisory area, and fortunately resulted in fewer victims.

== Eruptions after June 3, 1991 ==

The eruption activity continued until March 1995, with a temporary pause during its course. Between 1991 and 1994, the volcano generated at least 10,000 small pyroclastic flows, destroying about 2,000 houses. From 1993 onward, the rate of lava effusion gradually decreased, and eruptions came to an end in 1995.

The 1990–1995 eruptions of Unzen were the first eruptive activities in the world where pyroclastic flows were recorded clearly and continuously on video (in the past, many pyroclastic flows, such as those on Mt. Pelee, were recorded either as photographs or on small-scale videos).

Dome collapses and pyroclastic flows continued.

The first large-scale dome collapses and pyroclastic flows occurred after June 3 on September 15, 1991. Progressive failure of the NE flank of the lava dome started at 16:44, with major flows following at 17:59 and 18:45 before the largest pyroclastic flow at 18:54. The first flows descended towards the NE and stopped just short of Kita-Kamikoba. The main flow initially descended on the NE flank and was then deflected by Taruki height, directing it to the SE, after which it passed through the already ravaged Kita-Kamikoba, where it remobilized debris from the June 3 eruption, then continued east through the Mizunashi river valley. As the pyroclastic flow reached Onokoba the pyroclastic surge detached from the main flow body as it continued moving to the SE before losing its energy and stopping. The surge was powerful enough to move a car , flatten and uproot large trees and even move large debris in Kita-Kamikoba and Onokoba. The surge destroyed the Onokaba elementary school and burned down 150 homes.

== Current status (post-1995) ==

=== Effects of the Heisei eruptions/restoration work ===
The eruptive activity caused great damage to the Shimabara Peninsula, especially Shimabara City and Fukae Town. The main factor that led to damage were debris flows and lahars, initiated by heavy rain which destabilized pyroclastic flow and ash debris previously deposited on the slopes. The Mizunashi basin, as well as the Senbongi district and parts of Shimabara were severely damaged. In addition, there was concern about the collapse of Mt. Mayuyama, which previously caused the 1792 disaster. In this eruptive activity, however, Mt. Mayuyama protected the center of Shimabara from the pyroclastic flows.

In areas other than Shimabara and Fukae, there was ash fall depending on the wind direction, and at Kumamoto Airport, it had an impact on the arrival and departure of aircraft.

Since the eruptions, heavy rains have frequently remobilised pyroclastic material, generating lahars. Dikes have been constructed in several river valleys to channel lahar flows away from vulnerable areas, and warning systems and evacuation plans have been developed and deployed.

* Among the areas destroyed by the pyroclastic flows, the area around Heisei Shinzan and the upper part of the Mizunashi River are still designated as warning areas because of the possibility of collapses of the mountain.
* The Mizunashi River was completely filled by earth and sand dredging. Dykes and bridges have been strengthened. In the downstream area, there was too much sediment, so a new residential area was built on the sediment. In addition, a roadside station Mizunashi Honjin Fukae was installed on National Route 251.
* On the coast, a landfill (Heisei-cho) was built by the earth and sand transported, and the Unzendake Disaster Memorial Hall, Shimabara Reconstruction Arena and Shimabara Workers General Welfare Center were built there.
* 10 million yen of support was provided to the residents with completely destroyed households. A new residential area – the &quot;Nita housing complex&quot; – was created on a hill for the victims.
* Various assistance was provided to prevent farmers from leaving the area. The Agricultural Improvement and Extension Center conducted interviews with all affected households (667 households) and held consultations for those who wished to resume agriculture until 1999. Training allowances were provided for those who plan to change the crops handled, and the reconstruction fund received a subsidy for the installation of a greenhouse or relocation costs. In parallel, the irrigation facilities in the affected areas were also developed. At the time of resuming agriculture in 2000, the number of farmers in the affected areas had decreased to 374. However, these support measures were successful, and the value of agricultural production in Shimabara City and Fukae Town recovered to almost the same level as before the disaster in 2005.
* On the bottom of the Ariake Sea off Shimabara city, volcanic ash had accumulated of mud and it has had difficulty recovering naturally.
* Heisei Shinzan has been surveyed and climbed several times (the general public is prohibited from climbing because of the alert area), and a detailed observation of the lava dome was carried out. Even now, active fumaroles can be observed from several places on the summit.
* The Shimabara Railway Line passed through the area affected by the eruptions, but was restored on some elevated reduction, including a disaster zone in 2008. Shimabaragaiko Station continued to operate, but Kazusa Station was abandoned.

Mount Unzen was designated a Decade Volcano by the United Nations, in 1991 as part of their International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, due to its history of violent activity and location in a densely populated area.

==Unzen Scientific Drilling Project (USDP)==
In 1999, an ambitious project began at Mount Unzen to drill deep inside the volcano and sample magma in the 1990–1995 eruption conduit. The project hoped to shed light on some fundamental questions in volcanology, such as why magma repeatedly travels in the same conduits despite the solidification of magma in them at the end of each eruption, and how it can lose enough gas on its ascent to erupt effusively rather than explosively.

Drilling began with test bores to assess the viability of a deep borehole. Two holes were drilled, and deep, and cores taken from these holes were used to better determine Unzen&#x27;s eruptive history. One further deep borehole was drilled to test the methods to be used in the final drilling project.

The main drill began in 2003, starting from the northern flank of the volcano with a hole at an angle of 25 degrees from vertical. At greater depths, the direction of boring was tilted towards the conduit, reaching an angle of 75 degrees from vertical at a depth of . Drilling reached , the original target depth, without reaching the conduit, but in July 2004 at a depth of , the conduit was finally reached. The vertical depth below the summit was .

The temperature at the conduit was about , much lower than pre-drill estimations of and over. This was attributed to hydrothermal circulation accelerating the cooling of the magma over the nine to ten years since the end of the eruption.

<text>Saxifragaceae is a family of herbaceous perennial flowering plants, within the core eudicot order Saxifragales. The taxonomy of the family has been greatly revised and the scope much reduced in the era of molecular phylogenetic analysis. The family is divided into ten clades, with about 640 known species in about 35 accepted genera. About half of these consist of a single species, but about 400 of the species are in the type genus &quot;Saxifraga&quot;. The family is predominantly distributed in the northern hemisphere, but also in the Andes in South America.

== Description ==

Species are herbaceous perennials (rarely annual or biennial), sometimes succulent or xerophytic, often with perennating rhizomes. The leaves are usually basally aggregated in alternate rosettes, sometimes on inflorescence stems. They are usually simple, rarely pinnately or palmately compound. Their margins may be entire, deeply lobed, cleft, crenate or dentate and petiolate with stipules.

The inflorescences are bracteate racemes or cymes. The flowers are hermaphroditic (bisexual), rarely unisexual (androdioecious), actinomorphic (rarely zygomorphic). The perianth is placed on a hypanthium that may be free or may be partly fused with the ovary (which is then semi-inferior). There are usually five sepals, but there may be three to ten, fused with the hypanthium, occasionally petaloid. The petals are clawed, sometimes cleft at the tip or finely dissected. Flowers have five to ten stamens, free and opposite the petals, with the anthers usually basifixed and opening by lengthwise slits. The ovary is inferior to semi-inferior with two (sometimes three) carpels usually fused at the base, sometimes free, each topped with stylodium and capitate stigma. The ovules are few to many, with axile or parietal placentation and two to three styles. The fruit is usually a septicidal capsule or follicle, with numerous small seeds.

== Taxonomy ==
Saxifragaceae has long been considered in a pivotal position in the evolution of angiosperm lineage, located in an ancestral &quot;Saxifragalean stock&quot;. Historically the Saxifragaceae have included many very morphologically disparate taxa in systems based on morphology alone, and has been very difficult to classify and characterize phenotypically. Consequently many different classifications have been published, differing considerably in both the relationship of the family to other angiosperms, and its internal structure, for instance the systems of Cronquist (1981), Dahlgren (1983), Engler (1890), Hutchinson (1973), Schulze-Menz (1964), Takhtajan (1980) and Thorne (1992) (&quot;for a history, see &quot;. In its broadest circumscription, it included 17 subfamilies. This construction is referred to as Saxifragaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot; (&quot;s.l.&quot;). Within those subfamilies, the large majority of genera (30) were located within subfamily Saxifragoideae, the core group, with all but two of the remainder only having 1-3 genera.

The circumscription of the family has changed considerably in recent years, in large part due to molecular phylogenetic work showing the family &quot;s.l.&quot; to be polyphyletic, and probably represents the most extreme example, with at least 10 evolutionary lines. Consequently the circumscription has been considerably reduced, with many of the subfamilies being either elevated to separate families, or placed as components of other families, often quite distant. For instance subfamily Parnassioideae was raised to the level of family Parnassiaceae, and eventually a subfamily of Celastraceae (order Celastrales). Similarly the Hydrangoideae is now the family Hydrangeaceae (order Cornales).

The reduced Saxifragaceae is distinguished by being referred to as Saxifragaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot; (&quot;s.s.&quot;), corresponding to the Saxifragoideae a natural monophyletic group. Historically, the Saxifragaceae has been placed in either the orders Rosales or Saxifragales. This reduced Saxifragaceae, corresponding to subfamily Saxifragoideae and its 30 genera, is now placed within the Saxifragales. There, with three other subfamilies (Ribesoideaee, Iteoideae and Pterostemonoideae) it forms the Saxifragaceae alliance, while Penthoroideae and Tetracarpaeoideae are closely related within the core Saxifragales as shown in the cladogram. The remaining subfamilies are all transferred to more distant orders within the rosid and asterid clades.


=== Subdivision ===


Numerous attempts have been made to subdivide Saxifragoideae (Saxifragaceae &quot;s.s.&quot;). These have included dividing the family by the placentation of the ovules, as either parietal (e.g. &quot;Heuchera&quot;) or axile (e.g. &quot;Saxifraga&quot;). None of these has been supported by molecular data.

Molecular data indicate that the family can be considered as a number of informal clades, with two main lineages, saxifragoids and heucheroids and further subdivision of heucheroids into nine subclades or groups:
;Clades (Genera (Species))
* Saxifragoids (&quot;Saxifraga&quot; (370))
* Heucheroids (remaining genera):
** Leptarrhena (&quot;Leptarrhena&quot; (1), &quot;Tanakaea&quot; (1))
** Saniculiphyllum (&quot;Saniculiphyllum&quot; (1))
** Boykinia (&quot;Boykinia (6), Bolandra (2), Hieronymusia (1), Jepsonia (3), Sullivantia (3), Suksdorfia&quot; (2), &quot;Telesonix&quot; (2))
** Astilbe (&quot;Astilbe&quot; (23), &quot;Saxifragopsis&quot; (1))
** Heuchera (Heuchera (36), &quot;Bensoniella (1), Conimitella (1), Elmera (1), Lithophragma (10), Mitella (20), Tellima (1), Tiarella&quot; (3), &quot;Tolmiea&quot; (1))
** Cascadia (&quot;Cascadia&quot; (1), &quot;Saxifragodes&quot; (1))
** Darmera (&quot;Darmera (1), Astilboides (1), Bergenia (10), Mukdenia (1), Oresitrophe&quot; (1), &quot;Rodgersia&quot; (5))
** Peltoboykinia (&quot;Peltoboykinia&quot; (1), &quot;Chrysosplenium&quot; (55))
** Micranthes (&quot;Micranthes&quot; (70))

The clades and subclades are related as shown in the cladogram:

==== Genera ====

Saxifragaceae &quot;s.s.&quot; has about 33–35 genera and about 640 species. About half of the genera (18 of 33) are monotypic, but &quot;Saxifraga&quot; has about 400 species, and has generally been divided into sections.

=== Evolution and biogeography ===

The crown group of Saxifragaceae diversified at about 38 Mya (Mid–Late Eocene), with the two main lineages diversifying arising at about 30 Mya (Late Miocene/Early Oligocene). The present day heucheroid diversity dates later than the Miocene (&quot;see sublabels in Cladogram II&quot;). Ancestral Saxafragaceae emerged in either East Asia or Western North America, with subsequent dispersal West to Europe and south to South America. From the Eocene to the late Miocene these ancestral land masses were joined by the Bering Land Bridge facilitating plant migration. 

=== Etymology ===

The family and type genus name are derived from the two Latin words &quot;saxum&quot; (rock), and &quot;frango&quot; (to break), but the exact origin is unknown, although surmised to refer to either growing in crevices in rocks or medicinal use for kidney stones.

== Distribution and habitat ==

Primarily Northern hemisphere temperate and arctic regions, and also tropical montane, including the Americas, Europe, North Africa (including montane Ethiopia) and temperate and subtropical Asia to Luzon and New Guinea. In the Americas it extends south to central Mexico and the Andes to Tierra del Fuego. Centres of diversity are western N America, East Asia and the Himalayas. The largest concentration of genera are in the Pacific North West. Some &quot;Saxifraga&quot; and &quot;Chrysosplenium&quot; are circumboreal. Others have disjunct distributions between E Asia and N America, while other taxa have separate narrow distributions in southern S America. Some species are found in wet woodlands, swamplike conditions and wet cliff edges.

<doc id="749659" wikidata="Q376232" url="?curid=749659" title="William Lyne Wilson">
<text>William Lyne Wilson (May 3, 1843 – October 17, 1900) was an American politician and lawyer from West Virginia. A Bourbon Democrat, he was elected to the United States Congress in 1882 and served six terms of office, ending in 1895.

Following his departure from the House of Representatives, he was appointed Postmaster General of the United States by President Grover Cleveland, and remained in that cabinet-level position until 1897. After leaving government service, he was named President of Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia.

==Biography==

===Early years and marriage===

William Lyne Wilson was born in Charles Town, Virginia (now West Virginia) on May 3, 1843. He attended Charles Town Academy, graduated from Columbian College, today part of George Washington University, from which he graduated in 1860. He subsequently studied at the University of Virginia.

During the Civil War, he enlisted in the Confederate Army and served as a private in the 12th Virginia Cavalry.

After the war, Wilson for several years, he taught school at Columbian College during which he graduated from law school. He was admitted to the bar in 1869 and opened a private practice in Charles Town.

He was chosen as president of West Virginia University, taking office on September 4, 1882.

He married the daughter of Rev. A.J. Huntington, D.D., professor of Greek in Columbian University.

===Political career===

Wilson was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1880. He was elected a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives shortly afterward and won reelection five times afterwards, serving from 1883 to 1895. He served as chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means from 1893 to 1895 during which he co-authored the Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act which slightly reduced the United States tariff rates from the numbers set by the McKinley Tariff of 1890.

After leaving Congress, Wilson was appointed Postmaster General in the cabinet of President Grover Cleveland and served from 1895 to 1897. During that time, future Secretary of War Newton D. Baker served as his private secretary. In 1896, he broke party lines by opposing the Free Silver Movement led by Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan and, like many Bourbon Democrats, backed the National Democratic candidate John McAuley Palmer who supported the traditional gold standard, limited government and opposed protectionism.

===Death and legacy===

After leaving office as Postmaster General, Wilson served as president of Washington and Lee University. Wilson died in Lexington, Virginia, on October 17, 1900, and was interred in Edgehill Cemetery in Charles Town.

A portion of U.S. Route 340 between Harpers Ferry and Charles Town, West Virginia, is designated the William L. Wilson Freeway in his honor.

<text>Dominique Ané (born 6 October 1968), better known as &quot;Dominique A&quot;, is a French songwriter and singer.

==Early life==
Born on 6 October 1968 in Provins, France, Dominique Ané is the only child of a teacher and a homemaker. He was passionate about literature and music from a young age. He was interested in the punk music of the time, but at the age of 14, at the beginning of the 1980s, he started to appreciate the dark romanticism of the new wave movement. After his baccalaureate, he studied humanities for a year, and, at the same time, did a range of odd jobs, including his spell as a utility man for an FM radio station in Nantes, where his family lived. At around the age of 16, he started up a band, John Merrick, named after the hero of the film &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, a movie by David Lynch.

The foursome recorded a vinyl album of somber, tormented songs and gave a number of concerts in the area around Nantes. Later, with the singer Katerine, he recorded a number of songs, in a different, more upbeat and livelier style.

==Beginning of a career==
He began, at the start of the 1990s, to record more songs, which were both minimalist and rock in style. He wanted to break with the traditional chanson, which he considered to be more literary than musical. His first CD, released by the Nantes label, Lithium, met with critical acclaim, appreciated by the eminent alternative magazine, &quot;Les Inrockuptibles&quot;, and by Bernard Lenoir, the &#x27;John Peel&#x27; of France. Furthermore, his song, &quot;Le Courage des oiseaux&quot;, (the Courage of the Birds), was an underground hit.

From 1992 onwards, he started to produce more and more live shows, either with a backing band, or solo. His commercial success grew in 1995, with &quot;Le twenty-two bar&quot;, a single off the album, &quot;La Mémoire Neuve&quot;, but this success left a bitter taste in Dominique&#x27;s mouth, as he considered the song to be particularly badly written.

In 2000, he composed the score for Antoine Desrosières&#x27; black comedy film Banqueroute.

Dominique has cited Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) and Suicide as influences.

In 2001, on the album Auguri produced by John Parish, he covered a song by the group Polyphonic Size, &quot;Je t&#x27;ai Toujours Aimee&quot;.

==&quot;Le Détour&quot; and beyond (2002–)==
Dominique&#x27;s discovery of Alain Bashung&#x27;s dark 2002 album, &quot;L&#x27;Imprudence&quot; shocked him to the point that it put his music into question and he decided to explore different ways of working. He decided to compile what he considered to be the first part of a musical time capsule, a longbox entitled &quot;Le Détour&quot;. He asked his fans to write about their relationship with his music, and some of their letters were published in the booklet accompanying Le Détour.

For his subsequent album, he wanted to experiment and consequently, for the first time, he gave control over the album to a third party, the team who produced L&#x27;Imprudence. The result would be &quot;Tout sera comme avant&quot; (Everything will be like it was before), which was released in 2004. Unfortunately, many fans had difficulty understanding and accepting the musical change the album represents. At the same time, Dominique did a lot of live shows, with diverse arrangements: with a big band, with minimalistic backing, or all alone (where he would experiment with oversampling).

In March 2006, &quot;L&#x27;Horizon&quot; came out, a new work that he produced alongside Dominique Brusson, with whom he had made the early album, &quot;Remué&quot;. It was the first time that Dominique A returned to work with a producer. He was backed by his old collaborators, Sacha Toorop and Olivier Mellano, as well as the musicians with whom he produced Tout sera comme avant.

==Collaboration and influence==
Dominique A collaborates regularly with other artists and on other projects. He has been one of the shaping forces of his former girlfriend and French pop star Françoiz Breut&#x27;s career, writing many of her songs since her début in 1997. He has also composed several songs for Jeanne Balibar&#x27;s second album, &quot;Slalom Dale&quot; and wrote &quot;Où est la ville ?&quot; for Jane Birkin&#x27;s 2006 album, Fictions. He has also sung the song &quot;Veruca Salt et Frank Black&quot; in trio with Keren Ann and Vincent Delerm on the latter&#x27;s second album, Kensington Square.

Dominique A has inspired and influenced many artists. He has influenced many instrumentalist artists, such as Yann Tiersen and the electro band, Oslo Telescopic, who named one of their albums &quot;The Dominique O Project.&quot; Lyrically, his movement away from the constraints of chanson moved many others- including Miossec, Holden and Arman Méliès – by showing them that it was possible to make music that reflected their tastes and feelings using French.

<text>Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus (; 25 December 1876 – 9 June 1959) was a German chemist who won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1928 for his work on sterols and their relation to vitamins. He was the doctoral advisor of Adolf Butenandt who also won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1939.

== Biography ==
He was born in Berlin, Germany on 25 December 1876 to a family who owned a drapery business. He attended a prestigious French grammar school, where he focused primarily on literature. Windaus began studying medicine at the University of Berlin in about 1895 then proceeded to study chemistry at the University of Freiburg. He married Elizabeth Resau in 1915 and they had three children together, Günter, Gustav, and Margarete. After earning his PhD in medicine, Windaus became the head of the chemical institute at the University of Göttingen from 1915 to 1944. Throughout his life, Windaus won many awards including the Goethe Medal, the Pasteur Medal, and the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. In addition to his many accomplishments and discoveries in science, Windaus was also one of the very few German chemists who did not work with the Nazis and openly opposed their regime. As the head of the chemical institute at the University of Göttingen, Windaus personally defended one of his Jewish graduate students from dismissal. Windaus believed that while every man had a moral code, his science was motivated by curiosity, and was not driven by politics, ethics, and applications of his discoveries. This viewpoint caused Windaus to decline to research poison gas during World War I.

== Research ==
He was involved in the discovery of the transformation of cholesterol through several steps to vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol). He gave his patents to Merck and Bayer and they brought out the medical Vigantol in 1927.

Sterols

Windaus began his research by studying sterols. In particular, Windaus studied cholesterol, which is the best known sterol. Sterols are nitrogen-free secondary alcohols with high molecular weight that contain alicylic systems, or hydrocarbon rings. Cholesterol was first discovered in human gallstones and is a mono-unsaturated alcohol found in all higher animals, both as a free alcohol and fatty acid ester. Windaus was fascinated by how cholesterol levels in the body fluctuate, in particular how it increases during pregnancy and decreases during disease. He researched sterols in insects, echinodermata, and sponges, called zoosterols. Many of these zoosterols have the same formula as cholesterol, except for spongosterol, which is a saturated sterol and more different from cholesterol than the other zoosterols. In plants, the sterols are known as phytosterols. Windaus found that the most common phytosterols are sitosterols, which have the same formula as cholesterol. There are also saturated phytosterols that are mixed in with these unsaturated sitosterols in small quantities. There are also alcohol-like phytosterols, which contain one more hydroxyl group than sitosterols and a different number of carbons. Mycosterols are sterols which are found in fungi. Ergosterol is one significant mycosterol as it has three double bonds, in comparison to the one double bond in cholesterol. In his research, Windaus did not find sterols to exist in bacteria, which he found to be surprising. This research of the composition of sterols, along with their connection to vitamins, earned Windaus the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1928.

Vitamin D2 and D3

Rickets, a bone disease resulting from vitamin D deficiency, was originally treated in the early 1900s through essential dietary factors such as whole milk or cod-liver oil. It was also postulated that increase sunlight was improving conditions, but was improperly concluded that cholesterol was the precursor activated via UV light. In testing this, investigators under Windaus’ instruction found that completely pure cholesterol - converted into its dibromide and recrystallized - had lost its antirachitic effects upon irradiation. It was then postulated that a different substance associated with ‘chemically pure’ cholesterol through all usual stages of purification is the precursor to vitamin D.

The impurity was able to precipitate with digitonin, showing chemical properties of a steroid with three double bonds. The three UV absorption peaks (see image) of the active impurity was used to purify, and become highly concentrated through high-vacuum distillation and charcoal adsorption techniques. In evaluating a variety of sterols that showed antirachitic activity upon irradiation, done so in consultation with A.F. Hess, O. Rosenheim, and T.A. Webster, ergosterol (see image)- Ca27H42 – was found to be the only precursor of vitamin D, convertible under wavelength between 253 and 302 nm. Similarities of ergosterol to that of the active fraction from cholesterol included similar UV spectrums, rapid destruction by oxidation, and production of the same color reaction with sulfuric acid.

This production of Vitamin D2, or calciferol (see image), was a complete cure to rachitis – 100,000 times more effective than fish liver oil – and Windaus and his group were able to determine its chemical properties. This included being isomeric with ergosterol with a hydroxyl group and three conjugated double bonds; the correct structure was confirmed in 1936.The possibility of polymerization was tested to be inaccurate through evaluating the molecular weight, and were also able to denounce certain isomerization. The secondary alcohol displacing to a double bond via Zerewitinoff&#x27;s method (see image) was shown to not occur, as well as the double bond transforming to a steric rearrangement didn&#x27;t occur under observance of titration and catalytic hydrogenation. Ergosterol was originally found in fungi and not animal organisms, so the question of obtaining Vitamin D from sunlight was still in question and studied by Windaus long after receiving the Nobel Prize. In isolating and identifying 7-dehydrocholesterol in hog skin, and later human skin, whole milk, and animal liver, it too was antirachitic upon irradiation. This was already a known compound derived from cholesterol, and the new irradiation product was named Vitamin D3, or cholecalciferol (see image). Windaus established the structure by investigating the photochemical reactions within its formation.

<text>: &quot;This is an article about a precursor to Romanian popular theater. For the antediluvian patriarch, see Irad&quot;
Irozii (singular &quot;Irod&quot;) were Romanian Orthodox minstrel shows, played in the Christmas season, centered on the figure of Herod the Great () and the Massacre of the Innocents. Along with a New Year tradition of imitation peasant weddings, they are generally considered the origin of Romanian-language popular theater. 

&quot;Irozii&quot; influenced the Purim plays of the Romanian Jews (generally credited as the origin of Yiddish theater) and &quot;vice versa&quot;. Thus, the origin of Romanian-language popular theater in the first half of the 19th century was echoed in the later origin (also in Romania) of Yiddish theater.

Typically performed by schoolteachers and deacons, &quot;irozii&quot; initially took place in the boyar&#x27;s or lord&#x27;s court; in later years, performances would be given in the salons of the grand houses. &quot;Irozii&quot; began to fade in the late 19th century; elaborate pageants are no longer common, though a less elaborate form continues.

<text>Paias Wingti (born 2 February 1951) is a Papua New Guinean politician. He served as the third prime minister of Papua New Guinea between 1985 and 1988, and again from 1992 to 1994.

==Early life and education==
Wingti hails from the Jika Tribe of the Western Highlands province, and was born in Moika village, near Mount Hagen. He did not go to school until the age of 10, but was later educated at Mount Hagen High School. He enrolled at the University of Papua New Guinea in Port Moresby in 1974, and first visited Australia as an Australian Union of Students delegate for the UPNG Student Representative Council. While doing his final year in Economics at university, he contested the 1977 election, and won the Hagen Open seat, joining Michael Somare&#x27;s Pangu Party.

==Political career==
He served as Minister for Civil Aviation from 1978 until the defeat of the first Somare government in 1980, and when Somare returned to power in 1982, became Deputy Prime Minister. He split with the Pangu Party in 1985 and formed the People&#x27;s Democratic Movement, becoming Leader of the Opposition. In November 1985, he moved a successful no-confidence vote against the Somare government and became the third prime minister of Papua New Guinea aged 34. Julius Chan, the second prime minister, served as Wingti&#x27;s deputy. He was made a Privy Councillor in 1987.

He remained in power after the 1987 election after corralling a slender majority of three votes. He announced a more independent foreign policy, attempting to enhance relations with the Soviet Union, U.S., Japan and China. He lost a motion of confidence in July 1988 with changes in the shifting coalition and was succeeded by Rabbie Namaliu, the new leader of the Pangu Party, but Wingti returned for a further two-year stint in 1992. His second term was marked by an escalation of unrest in Bougainville and he was ousted by Julius Chan in August 1994. Wingti continued to represent the Western Highlands in the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea, although he switched from the local Hagen constituency to the provincial-level electorate in 1995.

Wingti served as the governor of Western Highlands Province from 1995 to 1997, when he was defeated for re-election by Father Robert Lak. He returned to parliament in 2002, defeating Lak to regain his seat and the governorship. He subsequently won back the leadership of the People&#x27;s Democratic Movement from Mekere Morauta, who had taken over after his defeat, in 2007. However, he was defeated in his bid for re-election at the 2007 election, losing to former student activist Tom Olga, largely as a result of the new preferential voting system.. Wingti, along with fellow former prime minister Rabbie Namaliu, were the most high-profile losers of the election. Additionally, Wingti lost the governorship of West Highlands Province to Olga. The PDM also suffered a major defeat in the election, losing several seats. He nominated to contest the July 2012 general elections and defeated Tom Olga by 112640 votes to 89195, a difference of 23445 votes and elected Governor of Western Highlands Province. He was one of the three former prime ministers who backed Peter O&#x27;Neil to be retained as prime minister of Papua New Guinea at Parliament House on 3 August 2012.

<text>Edward Winslow (18 October 15958 May 1655) was a Separatist and New England political leader who traveled on the &quot;Mayflower&quot; in 1620. He was one of several senior leaders on the ship and also later at Plymouth Colony. Both Edward Winslow and his brother, Gilbert Winslow signed the Mayflower Compact. In Plymouth he served in a number of governmental positions such as assistant governor, three times was governor and also was the colony&#x27;s agent in London. In early 1621 he had been one of several key leaders on whom Governor Bradford depended after the death of John Carver. He was the author of several important pamphlets, including &quot;Good Newes from New England&quot; and co-wrote with William Bradford the historic &quot;Mourt&#x27;s Relation&quot;, which ends with an account of the First Thanksgiving and the abundance of the New World. In 1655 he died of fever while on an English naval expedition in the Caribbean against the Spanish.

He is the only original Plymouth colonist with an extant portrait painted from life. This, along with portraits of Winslow&#x27;s son and daughter-in-law, and various Winslow family artifacts, are in the Pilgrim Hall Museum, in Plymouth, Massachusetts.

== English origins ==

Edward Winslow was born on 18th October 1595 and was baptized two days later on the 20th of October at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Droitwich in Worcestershire, England. He was the eldest son of Edward Winslow Sr. of Droitwich, in Worcestershire, by his wife Magdalene Oliver whom he had married the previous year at St. Bride&#x27;s Church, Fleet Street, London.
Edward Winslow, the father, according to family records, was born October 17, 1560, and was a descendant of the Winslow family of Kempsey, Worcestershire, a line that had existed in the county at least since 1500. The Winslow estate in Kempsey was called Kersweil with a similar name of Careswell later being given to the gentrified Plymouth estate of Governor Josiah Winslow, son of Edward Winslow and Susanna.

Author Charles Banks notes that it is highly probable that this Edward, Sr. was the son of Kenelm Winslow of Kempsey. Author Eugene Stratton believes that no one has been able to discern Kenelm Winslow&#x27;s ancestry with any certainty. Kenelm Winslow, probably a brother of Edward Sr., born in 1551, was called a resident of Worcester, yeoman, in 1605. It is not certain if the family was gentry, but were at least fairly well-off. Edward Sr. was an under-sheriff and involved in the salt production trade.

Edward Winslow had four younger brothers: Gilbert (who accompanied him on the Mayflower in 1620), John, Josiah, and Kenelm, all of whom followed Edward and Gilbert to America over the next decade.

Between April 1606 and April 1611, Edward Winslow attended the King&#x27;s School at Worcester Cathedral, under Henry Bright. Two years later, in August 1613, he became an apprentice contracted for a total of eight years to John Beale, a stationer and citizen of London. After an apparent legal dispute with Beale, however, Winslow&#x27;s contract was re-made with his being apprenticed in October 1615, for eight years. But Winslow apparently did not fulfill his contract with Beale as about two years later, in 1617, he moved to Leiden, Holland to join the Separatist church there.

== In Leiden, 1617–1620 ==
In 1617 Edward Winslow traveled to Leiden Holland to join the English exile Separatist church and help Elder William Brewster with his underground (illicit) printing activities. Brewster and young Edward Winslow in 1618 were responsible for a religious tract, &quot;Perth Assembly&quot;, critical of the English king and his church bishops which caused an angry King James to order Brewster&#x27;s arrest, sending English government agents to Holland to try to find and seize him. The Pilgrims had bad fortune in this, as Elder Brewster was forced to hide, first in Holland, then in England, from the agents just when the Pilgrims needed his leadership in preparation for their departure for America.

On April 27, 1618, Winslow married Leiden Elizabeth Barker, he being called a printer from London. Johnson reports that a search of possible English ancestral and baptismal records for Elizabeth does not reveal anything of note.

Winslow quite soon became a leading member of the English exiles meeting as the Leiden church group. On June 10, 1620, Winslow was one of four men – the others being William Bradford, Isaac Allerton, and Samuel Fuller, who wrote a letter representing the Leiden congregation to their London agents John Carver and Robert Cushman regarding the terms upon which the Pilgrims would travel to the Americas. The trip preparations became quite taxing on everyone&#x27;s patience and pocket-book due to the various Thomas Weston financial schemes that used up what monies they had and as author Nathaniel Philbrick wrote: &quot;..during preparations to sail for America, the Pilgrims demonstrated an extraordinary talent for getting duped.&quot;

== &quot;Mayflower&quot; voyage ==
Winslow and his wife Elizabeth were part of the Leiden Separatist group who had decided to travel far away from England and the repressive regime of King James I to more freely practice their religious beliefs. Merchant Adventurer investment group agent Thomas Weston assisted in this venture by providing the ship &quot;Mayflower&quot; for the Pilgrim&#x27;s journey. Traveling on the &quot;Mayflower&quot; in company with the Winslows were his brother Gilbert and family servant/employee George Soule and a youth, Elias Story. Also in the care of the family was Elinor (Ellen) More, a girl of eight years. In all there were four unaccompanied More children from Shipton, Shropshire in the care of senior Pilgrims on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;: Elinor, Jasper, Mary and Richard. Elinor perished the winter of 1620 with only one brother Richard More surviving.

The &quot;Mayflower&quot; departed Plymouth, England on September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and the crew is estimated to be approximately 30 but the exact number is unknown. They lived in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship&#x27;s timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way, there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.

On November 9/19, 1620, after about three months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook. After several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the shelter of Cape Cod hook, now called Provincetown Harbor, where they anchored on November 11/21. The Mayflower Compact was signed that day.

==In Plymouth Colony==

The ill-prepared and poorly supplied colonists lost over half of their population through a multitude of problems – including hunger, scurvy, other diseases and their first bitter winter on the North American mainland. In the spring of 1621, Winslow and the others attended what would become known as the first Thanksgiving.

The people who survived all worked hard to provide food and shelter. Amidst criticism from Thomas Weston for not loading up the returning &quot;Mayflower&quot; with goods for the investors, William Bradford sent a letter stating the troubles encountered by the Mayflower passengers. He blamed Weston, and stated that Governor Carver had worked himself to death that spring and &quot;the loss of him and other industrious men lives cannot be valued at any price&quot;.
The following year the ship &quot;Fortune&quot; arrived at Plymouth colony but again, Thomas Weston had inadequately supplied the ship for the colony. With winter approaching, the colonists only had half the needed supplies, but as William Bradford recorded, &#x27;they all faced it bravely&#x27;.

The following year, despite the adversities of the winter, the colonists were able to load the &quot;Fortune&quot; for England with enough furs and other supplies to pay for over half of their indebtedness to the Merchant Adventurers, but the ship was attacked by the French as it came near the English coast and all the cargo was taken by the privateers.

On February 21, 1621, William White died leaving a widow, Susanna, and two sons, Resolved and Peregrine, the first child born in the colony. Edward Winslow lost his wife Elizabeth on March 24, 1621, and just a month and a half later, on May 12, 1621, Edward Winslow and Susanna White became the first couple to marry in Plymouth Colony. They were married in a civil ceremony by Governor William Bradford. The couple had three sons, one daughter, and one unknown child who died young.

== Leadership at Plymouth Colony and with Cromwell in England ==
Winslow made several voyages back to England in the 1620s, serving as ambassador for the Pilgrims and negotiating with the colony&#x27;s financial backers. In 1624, he brought the first cattle – three cows and a bull – to Plymouth. They came from Devon, England, and their descendants became the American Milking Devon breed, which were much valued because they could be used for milk, beef, and as oxen, and were good foragers (did not require supplemental feed).

 Winslow had established a friendship with native leader Massasoit, whose people were trading with the colonists. In January 1629 a new patent for land at Kennebec was approved which provided for a fishing and trading post at Pentagoet and a fortified trading post at Cushnoc on the Kennebec which opened the area to Plymouth colonists. At the same time, Isaac Allerton opened his own trading post on the Kenebec and thereby became a rival of Edward Winslow, setting a pattern for the adversarial rivalry between them that would continue from that time on.

In 1632, he made an exploratory tour up the Connecticut River for colonization. It is suggested that he landed and selected the settlement which became Windsor.

Edward Winslow was an experienced diplomat acting for Plymouth in its relationship with English officials. He later was Plymouth governor for one-year terms from 1633–34, 1636–37, and 1644–45. Additionally, in 1643 Winslow was one of the commissioners of the United Colonies of New England, which was a military group uniting the various New England colonies against the natives.

By the early 1640s England was engaged in a great civil war. Some settlers returned to England to join the efforts to overthrow the reigning King, Charles I. In 1646, Winslow began working for Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector. After King Charles was executed in 1649, Edward Winslow had plans to return to Plymouth but soon became involved in the problems of England. He would never return to Plymouth.

Winslow lived for a short time in Clapham, Surrey together with a number of radical Puritan merchants, including James Sherley one of the financiers of the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. These merchants supported his campaign to send missionaries to the Indians in North America.

In 1654, Winslow was commissioner of an English naval mission against the Spanish in the West Indies. They were victorious but Winslow contracted yellow fever and died on May 7, 1655, near Jamaica.

== Marriage and children ==
Edward Winslow married:

# Elizabeth Barker after May 12, 1618, in Leiden Holland. She died on March 24, 1621, in Plymouth Colony. Elizabeth was buried in 1621 in the Cole&#x27;s Hill Burial Ground in Plymouth.

== Death and memorial of Winslow ==

Winslow is reported to have been buried at sea in the Caribbean somewhere between Hispaniola and Jamaica, sometime after May 7, 1655. Winslow Cemetery in Marshfield, Massachusetts has a stone monument to &quot;The Settlers of Green Harbor Marshfield&quot; with the name of Edward Winslow and his wife Susanna and many others. This includes the names of Susanna&#x27;s sons Resolved and Peregrine White and their wives. Also in Winslow Cemetery is a memorial stone with plaque stating &quot;Edward Winslow, Founder of Marshfield&quot;.

== Works ==
His writings, though fragmentary, are of the greatest value to the history of the Plymouth colony. They include:
* &quot;&quot; (1624) sold by John Bellamy;
* &quot;Hypocrisie Unmasked; by a True Relation of the Governor and Company of Massachusetts against Samuel Gorton, a Notorious Disturber of the Peace&quot; (1646), to which was added a chapter entitled &quot;A Brief Narration of the True Grounds or Cause of the First Plantation of New England&quot; sold by John Bellamy;
* &quot;New England&#x27;s Salamander&quot; (1647);
* &quot;The Danger of Tolerating Levelers in a Civil State&quot; (1649) and;
* &quot;The Glorious Progress of the Gospel amongst the Indians in New England&quot; (1649) with John Eliot and Thomas Mayhew Jr. sold by John Bellamy.

Edward Winslow, along with William Bradford are believed to have prepared a , published in 1622, which is generally known as &quot;Mourt&#x27;s Relation&quot;, owing to its preface having been signed by &quot;G. Mourt.&quot;

Some of his writings may be found reprinted in Alexander Young&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles of the Pilgrims&quot;.

<text>Josiah Winslow ( in Plymouth Colony – 1680 in Marshfield, Plymouth Colony) was the 13th Governor of Plymouth Colony. In records of the time, historians also name him Josias Winslow, and modern writers have carried that name forward. He was born one year after the Charter which founded the Massachusetts Bay Colony, bringing over 20,000 English immigrants to New England in the 1630s. Josiah was the Harvard College-educated son of &quot;Mayflower&quot; passenger and Pilgrim leader and Governor Edward Winslow and was Governor from 1673 to 1680. The most significant event during his term in office was King Philip&#x27;s War, which created great havoc for both the English and Indian populations and changed New England forever. Josiah was the first governor born in a &quot;New England&quot; colony.

==Early years==

Josiah Winslow&#x27;s parents were Edward Winslow (d. 1655) and his second wife, widow Susanna White. Her first husband had been Pilgrim William White, who died in February 1621, with whom she had sons Resolved and Peregrine White, all of whom were Mayflower passengers. The wedding of Edward Winslow and Susanna White was the first in Plymouth Colony.

In 1643 Josiah Winslow was chosen deputy to the general court from Marshfield, and in 1656 he succeeded Myles Standish as the commander of the colony&#x27;s military forces.

In 1657 he was chosen assistant governor, a post he filled until he was elected governor in 1673. Also, in 1658 he was Plymouth&#x27;s commissioner to the United Colonies (a Puritan military alliance against the Indians) until 1672. On October 2, 1658, he was commissioned as major-commandant of the colony&#x27;s militia forces which were consolidated on that same date into a regiment under Winslow&#x27;s command. He held this position until June 3, 1673, when, having been elected Governor of the Colony, he was succeeded by William Bradford Jr. On June 2, 1685, Plymouth Colony was divided into three counties (Plymouth, Barnstable and Bristol), and each county had its own regiment of militia.

In 1643, his father, Edward Winslow, was one of six signers of the new Articles of Confederation of the New England colonies, and in 1673 Josiah became the first native-born governor of the colony upon the death of Governor Thomas Prence.

==Governor==

One of Josiah&#x27;s first acts as governor, was to institute a policy of larger sympathy for the Quakers. He set free two men, Cudworth and Robinson, who were in prison for stating their sympathy for the formerly persecuted Quakers.

During his tenure in 1674–75 the first public school was established and in 1680 the first Lieutenant-Governor was elected. In 1675 he was elected General-in-Chief of the entire military forces of the United Colonies, being the first native-born general.

In 1675 the General Court ordered that four halberdiers (possibly as armed guards) should attend the governor and magistrates at elections and two during court sessions. The government maintained a state of readiness that was previously unknown in the colony.

On September 9, 1675, he signed a Declaration of War made by the commissioners against the Indian leader known as King Philip.

== King Philip&#x27;s War – cause and effect ==
King Philip&#x27;s War, also known variously as &quot;Metacomet&#x27;s War or Rebellion&quot; was between various Indian groups in New England and English colonists and their Indian allies and lasted between 1675–1678. King Philip was killed by a Puritan militia company headed by Major Benjamin Church on August 12, 1676.

On June 20, 1675, natives attacked colonial homesteads and war came to New England. King Philip (aka Metacomet) and Governor Winslow had allowed an acrimonious situation to get out of hand and the attack and the violence that followed surprised everyone – English and Indian alike.

Edward Winslow had been a Pilgrim leader who made peace with the native peoples and treated them honorably. But his son Josiah, who became the colony&#x27;s military commander about 1659, did not have a good relations with the Indians, and had a different view of them than his father did. Eventually the colonials no longer held the opinion, as they had for many years, of needing the help of the Indians for their survival. Many younger colonists especially began to see the Indians as an impediment to the development of the lands that they largely now saw as their own.

King Philip began his relationship with the English with the best interests of all at heart, but greed played a part in his thinking and he eventually was involved in a large scale transfer of native lands to the colonists, helped by a questionable character, Leiden-born Thomas Willet, who wrongly portrayed himself a friend to all parties.

From the 1650s to 1665–75, the sale of Indian lands to the colonists had increased greatly, from what was fourteen Indian land deeds registered in Plymouth court in the 1650s to a total of seventy-six deeds recorded between 1665 and 1675. Shiwei Jiang has several Plymouth deeds showing that Moses Simmons and his son Aaron, early settlers of Scituate, bought some lands from Josiah Winslow and Constant Southworth.

Governor Prence and Assistant Governor Winslow felt they had developed the best way to manage Indian affairs, with Thomas Willet being involved as King Philip&#x27;s contact with Josiah Winslow. Prence and Winslow tried to emulate the relationship that Bradford and Standish had with the Indians in 1622, but, as recorded by Hubbard, fell short of that goal. When Prence died in 1673 and Winslow became governor, King Philip was very displeased to have to conduct business with a man he immensely disliked. He felt that Winslow was connected somehow with the unsolved death of his brother &quot;Alexander&quot; who was mysteriously found dead. Winslow was also involved in the massive sale of Indian lands down to the outright confiscation of Indian-owned real estate. When Winslow had at first found that his real estate actions were deemed not to be legal in Plymouth, he went about forcing a change in the law to accommodate his unethical actions.

At the time that Josiah Winslow became governor of Plymouth Colony in 1673, he was seen by the local native peoples as the embodiment of all that was unwelcome about the relationship between the Indians and the colonists.

By the 1650s, the attitudes of both colonists and Indians in New England was changing – and with only a small part of original Indian lands from those that existed in 1620 remaining, young Indians pressured their leadership to take action against the colonists to prevent further land loss. The second generation of colonists also wanted action, as they coveted all remaining Indian lands and only awaited the time when the Indian race in New England, whether by war, disease or poverty, would cease to exist.

King Philip had for many years been placating his young warriors, promising war against the colonists. Philip always tried to avoid actually fighting colonial militias directly, and when confronted, would back down. And as late as June 23, 1675, Philip still hoped he could keep from going to war. But Winslow, by now ill with possible tuberculosis and in no condition to fight a war, whether on purpose or not, managed to work against Philip instead of helping him with the support he badly needed to keep his warriors in check. And Winslow had actually made matters worse when he prosecuted Tobias, a senior counselor to Philip, for the murder of an English-educated favorite – an Indian named John Sassamon, who the Indians may indeed have killed upon discovering he was a spy for the English.

The initial outbreak of violence that led to years of war was primarily caused by Winslow refusing to recognize that Philip&#x27;s problems were actually also his own problems too. And in the end, Governor Josiah Winslow was the person most responsible for King Philip&#x27;s War, possibly more than King Philip or anyone else.

Initially, Governor Winslow did have a chance, while the fighting was still contained locally, to resolve the situation peacefully by diplomatic means, but did not take needed action and brought about a major conflagration that actually need not have happened. An example of Winslow&#x27;s thinking, and about the first time slavery was used as a weapon against the Indians, was when several hundred Indians had surrendered to authorities in Plymouth and Dartmouth who had assured them of amnesty. But Winslow and his advisors on the Council of War refused to honor such assurance and the council decided, on August 4, that all surrendered Indians should be considered guilty whether or not they had been part of the attack in which they were captured. Within several months, all captured Indians from Plymouth and Dartmouth had been shipped as slaves to the Spanish at Cadiz.

== Family of Josiah and Penelope Pelham Winslow ==

Josiah Winslow married Penelope Pelham by 1651 and had four children.
Children of Josiah and Penelope Winslow, all born in Marshfield, Plymouth Colony:
* (infant), born and died March 1658.
* Elizabeth, born April 1664 and died June 11, 1735. She married, September 4, 1684, Stephen Burton as his 2nd wife. They had three children.
* Edward, born and died May 1667.
* Isaac, born 1670 and died December 6, 1738. He married, July 21, 1700, Sarah Wensley (or Hensley). She died December 16, 1753. They had two children. He was buried in Winslow Cemetery, Marshfield, Massachusetts. Isaac Winslow had an exemplary career in colonial military and governmental affairs. The Isaac Winslow House was built on the original homestead of Gov. Edward Winslow (Isaac&#x27;s grandfather) and still stands in Marshfield.
Josiah Winslow married Penelope Pelham in England in 1651, she being born about 1633. Her parents were Herbert Pelham, Esq., and Jemima (Waldegrave). Both parents had extensive noble lineage from England and elsewhere in Europe. Herbert Pelham, as well as his father-in-law Thomas Waldegrave were members of the &quot;Adventurers&quot; which provided investment in the Massachusetts Bay Company (later Colony) at its beginnings in 1630. Pelham advocated new settlement in New England and came to that colony with his family in 1638, being involved with the new Harvard College at Cambridge. At that time he was a young widower, his wife Jemima having just died, leaving him with four children including 5 year-old Penelope. Pelham soon married a young widow, Elizabeth Harlakenden. In 1643 Herbert Pelham was appointed treasurer of Harvard and in 1645 became Assistant to Governor Thomas Dudley. In late 1646 the Pelham family returned to England, where he had retained extensive family properties in England and Ireland. On the same ship going to England, they encountered Edward Winslow, who a few years later would be Penelope&#x27;s father-in-law. Winslow and Pelham had known each other, Pelham having witnessed a letter Winslow wrote to colony Governor Winthrop in 1644, and several years later worked together in England on colony-related business. In England Penelope may have learned about the life of an upper-class gentlewoman from her stepmother. In 1651 Josiah Winslow traveled to England to see his father who, in 1646, had joined the Puritan Protectorate government of Oliver Cromwell. Sometime between 1646 and 1651 Josiah met Penelope in England and it is believed they were married in 1651, which is when they, and Edward Winslow, all had portraits painted, seemingly as companion pictures. These paintings hang today in the Pilgrim Hall Museum.

Josiah and Penelope returned to Plymouth from England in 1655, the same year his father died at sea as part of a Caribbean naval expedition. In the 1660s the Winslows took up residence at the family estate of Carswell in Marshfield, which was named for the English estate of Josiah&#x27;s great-grandfather. Josiah enjoyed the distinction of being accomplished in the manner of an English gentleman, married to a quite wealthy and beautiful English wife.

== Death and burial of Josiah and Penelope Winslow ==
Josiah Winslow died on December 18, 1680, in Marshfield, Massachusetts Bay Colony at about age 51. In his will, dated July 2, 1675, he had named his wife Penelope, then age 47, as his estate administrator. In remembrance of her husband, Penelope had Boston silversmith John Coney place a lock of his hair in a mourning ring. After her husband&#x27;s death, Penelope continued to live at her home, Careswell, with her children Elizabeth and Isaac, who were still quite young.

Penelope Pelham Winslow died on December 7, 1703, at age 70. Both Josiah Winslow and his wife Penelope were buried in the Winslow Cemetery in Marshfield, which has a memorial to Josiah&#x27;s father Edward Winslow, who died at sea, and was the burial place of Josiah&#x27;s mother, Susanna White. Winslow Cemetery is where Josiah&#x27;s half-brothers Resolved and Peregrine White and their wives were also buried and for whom there is also a memorial.

<text>Justin Winsor (January 2, 1831October 22, 1897) was an American writer, librarian, and historian. His historical work had strong bibliographical and cartographical elements. He was an authority on the early history of North America and was elected the first president of the American Library Association as well as the third president of the American Historical Association.

==Background and education==
Winsor was born in Boston, Massachusetts, son of Nathaniel Winsor III (1806 – c. 1890) and Ann Thomas Howland Winsor (1809–1893). His father was a shipping merchant who had established the &quot;Winsor Line&quot;, one of the first regular lines of clipperships between Boston and San Francisco. Shortly before his birth, his parents had recently moved to Boston from Duxbury, Massachusetts, where the Winsor family had been involved in shipbuilding for generations. His grandfather&#x27;s home, the Nathaniel Winsor, Jr. House, is now the headquarters of the Duxbury Rural and Historical Society. 

Justin Winsor graduated from the Boston Latin School. He entered Harvard, but left in his senior year and never finished his education at the university. Around this time he planned an memoir of &quot;Garrick and his Contemporaries&quot;, of which the manuscript and notes are in the Harvard Library. He then studied in Paris and Heidelberg. Winsor would return to Harvard to complete his studies in 1868. He would go on to complete L.L. D. at the University of Michigan in 1887.

==Family==
In 1855, Winsor married Caroline Tufts Barker (1830–1911), daughter of Ebenezer and Sally Fuller Barker of Charlestown, Massachusetts. They had two children, Mary (born 1860) who died in infancy, and Constance (c. 1861 – 1895).

==Writer and editor==

Justin Winsor published his first book, &quot;A History of the Town of Duxbury&quot; (1849), during his first year at Harvard. He contributed to many periodicals, and, in addition to editing many smaller works, he edited some of the most important historical works of the 19th century, among them: &quot;Reader&#x27;s Handbook of American History&quot; (1879), &quot;The Memorial History of Boston&quot; (4 vols., 1880–1881) and the &quot;Narrative and Critical History of America&quot; (8 vols., 1884–1889). The latter was a standard history reference for decades.

==Librarian==
===Boston Public Library===

Winsor was one of the creators of the librarian profession, a strong proponent of the ability of libraries to uplift, and a leader in the effort to make libraries the center of universities. He started his library career as a trustee (1867–1868), then superintendent (1868–1877) of the Boston Public Library. As a member of the Boston Brahmins, Winsor found an opportunity to engage in social reform while pursuing intellectual interests. He reflected the Brahmins&#x27; strong belief in self-help, uplift, and social progress. They espoused the Socratic idea that knowledge creates virtue and Winsor saw the public library as a way to educate common people so that the traditional order of the republic would be maintained.

At Boston Public Library, Winsor undertook many projects used to track and help library use. He employed innovative statistical analysis of the library&#x27;s use and used the finding to promote the idea that libraries were not just institutions and repositories of books, but were a process. He also dedicated a great deal of attention to the compilation of bibliographies and guides to public reading. Also, Winsor annotated the catalog to give it an educational character. In an effort to increase book use, he worked for the establishment of branch libraries, extended hours, and relaxed restrictions on use.

===Harvard Librarian===
In 1877, following a struggle with Alderman Hugh O&#x27;Brien over the professionalism of library management, Winsor left Boston Public Library to become librarian of Harvard University, where he served until his death. In his dual career as librarian-historian, he was a prototype of the ideal academic librarian.

Winsor came to Harvard at a time when research was gaining emphasis. Faculty and students assumed ready access to large collections. Winsor wanted to make the library the center of the university. In this effort, he pushed for more books and greater accessibility, improved the catalog, informed faculty of new acquisitions, liberalized the library use policy, instituted a reserve system, and wrangled with administration over the installation of electric lights for extended hours. During this time, he also influenced the field through reports when library literature was scarce.

Winsor was also a founder of the American Library Association and the &quot;Library Journal,&quot; serving as the first president of the ALA from 1876 through 1885. In this position, he emphasized the need for trained professionals and provided a rationale for the need for libraries in combating attacks on American morals and social standards. The Library History Round Table of the ALA awards the &quot;Justin Winsor Prize&quot;, established in 1978, for exceptional library history essays.

Winsor is a member of the Library Hall of Fame.

==Historian==
He was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1878 and the American Antiquarian Society in 1880. He also served on the Massachusetts Archives Commission for many years. Winsor was a founding member of the American Historical Association and served as their third president during the 1886–1887 term. In 1893, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. The Justin Winsor Prize was the first prize established by the AHA and was awarded from 1896 through 1930 and from 1936 through 1938.

==Death==
Following illness over a period of time, Winsor dealt with a strangulated hernia while staying at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. An operation was done on October 17, 1897, which slightly improved his condition. However, on October 22, Winsor died following a fever as a result of the hernia. His death was mourned by the Academic Library community as well as the Harvard University community. Winsor&#x27;s funeral would be held at the Appleton Church on October 23, 1897, which would later be replaced by the Memorial Church of Harvard University.

<text>Conrad Louis Wirth (December 1, 1899 – July 25, 1993) was an American landscape architect, conservationist, and park service administrator. He was the longest-serving director of the National Park Service (NPS), serving from 1951 to 1964.

== Biography ==
Wirth was born in Hartford, Connecticut, where his father Theodore was park superintendent. Seven years later, Theodore moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he became superintendent of the Minneapolis Park System. Conrad Wirth grew up in the Theodore Wirth House, the home built by the Park System for his father, surrounded by city park. Conrad earned a Bachelor of Science degree in landscape gardening from Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst). He first came to the Washington, D.C., area to work for the National Capital Park and Planning Commission, and he joined the NPS in 1931. With the coming of the New Deal he supervised the service&#x27;s Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) program in the state parks. His administrative ability made him a successor to Director Arthur E. Demaray, whom he served as associate director before advancing to the top job in December 1951. Wirth&#x27;s crowning achievement was Mission 66, a 10-year, billion-dollar program to upgrade park facilities and services by the 50th anniversary of the NPS in 1966. Wirth submitted his resignation to President John F. Kennedy in the fall of 1963 and left the directorship in early 1964, after recommending George B. Hartzog Jr. as his successor.

He went on to supervise the Interior Department&#x27;s CCC program. A member of the National Geographic Society&#x27;s Board of Trustees, he was also active in conservation and Park Service alumni affairs. He died in his sleep in 1993.

== Legacy ==
The M/V &quot;Conrad Wirth&quot;, a 25-car ferry was named for him. The 112-ft. vessel was built in 1970 for the North Carolina Department of Transportation Ferry Division to cross Hatteras Inlet between Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands on the outer banks of North Carolina.

<text>Baba Tomor or Baba Tomorr (&#x27;Father Tomorr&#x27;) is the name of the father god, used in central Albanian mythology and folklore to refer to the father of gods and humans. Baba Tomor is related to the cult practiced on Mount Tomorr. According to the local tradition his consort is e Bukura e Dheut, a chthonic/earth goddess.

== Name ==
&quot;Baba Tomor&quot; means &quot;Father Tomor&quot; in Albanian, and is related to the cult practiced on Mount Tomorr.

The Albanian oronym &quot;Tomor(r)&quot; derives from the Illyrian name of mountain &quot;Tómaros&quot;, from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*tómhxes-&quot;, &#x27;dark&#x27; (cf. Latin &quot;temere&quot; &#x27;blindly, by chance&#x27;, Old Irish &quot;temel&quot; &#x27;darkness&#x27;, Old High German &quot;demar&quot; &#x27;darkness&#x27;, Old Church Slavonic &quot;tǐma&quot; &#x27;darkness&#x27;).

== Cult ==
The cult of Tomor may go back to Illyrians times, and Baba Tomor could be the remnant of an ancient Illyrian god. Mount Tomorr certainly seems to have been the site of a pre-Christian cult and to have been worshiped by the locals, both Christians and Muslims, as a mountain with a supernatural force—swearing solemn oaths &quot;By Him of Tomorr&quot; and &quot;By the Holy One of Tomorr&quot;, and practicing ritual sacrifices of animals—long before the shrine of Abbas Ali was correlated with the sacred site. The name of the village Mbrakull/Vrakull at the foot of Mount Tomorr, which evolved through Albanian sound changes from , suggests the existence of an oracle in the area during antiquity.

The enduring sanctity of the mountain, the annual pilgrimage to its summit, and the solemn sacrifice of a white bull by the local people provide abundant evidence that the ancient cult of the Sky-God on Mount Tomorr continues through the generations almost untouched by the course of political events and religious changes. The ancestors of the Albanians presumably had in common with the Ancient Greek theogony the tripartite division of the administration of the world into heaven, sea, and underworld, and in the same functions as the Greek deities Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades, they would have worshiped the deities referred to as the Beauty of the Sky (&quot;i Bukuri i Qiellit&quot;), the Beauty of the Sea (&quot;e Bukura e Detit&quot;), and the Beauty of the Earth (&quot;e Bukura e Dheut&quot;). According to the local folk tradition, the Beauty of the Earth (&quot;e Bukura e Dheut&quot;) is the consort of Baba Tomor. Baba Tomor is seen as an old man with a long white beard flowing down to his belt. He is accompanied by two female eagles and the winds are his servants.

==Legacy==
The cult of Tomor has been linked to romantic nationalism by many &quot;rilindas&quot;. In 1902, Andon Zako Çajupi, a notable Albanian rilindas, published in Cairo an anthology called &quot;Baba-Tomorri&quot; (&#x27;Father Tomorr&#x27;). Even today, Albanian people swear by him.

<text>Arizona Airways was an Arizona intrastate airline that operated 1946–1948, making substantial losses. About the time it ceased operations, it was federally certificated as a local service carrier to fly smaller routes in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), the now-defunct US federal agency that at the time tightly regulated almost all air transportation in the United States. However, the company was unable to resume service and ultimately, as a non-operating airline, contributed its routes and other assets to a 1 June 1950 three-way merger with Monarch Air Lines and Challenger Airlines to create the original Frontier Airlines.

==History==
===Startup===
Arizona Airways incorporated in Arizona on September 8, 1942. Its president was H.O. Nelson, an engineer and pilot, who went by the name Rocky. The company was originally formed to train Navy pilots during World War II. Other Nelson business interests included holding the local Ercoupe franchise. Robert Goldwater, brother of Barry, was on the company’s board once it recast as an actual airline. The airline ensured that all major parts of the state were represented on its board and this was noted by those outside of Phoenix.

In July 1945, prior to starting airline service, Arizona Airways arranged to buy a moribund, money-losing Transcontinental &amp; Western Air (TWA) route from Phoenix to Las Vegas (both states were then lightly populated; Arizona reached a population of 750,000 in 1950, when Nevada had a population of 160,000 vs 7.2mm and 3.2mm respectively in 2020). TWA stopped flying the route during World War II and did not want to resume it, so arranged to sell the route to Arizona Airways in exchange for $100,000 and the right to become a 20% owner. Arizona Airways needed CAB approval to fly an interstate route. In the meantime, on March 17, 1946, Arizona Airways started intrastate service with a 21-passenger DC-3 featuring a Thunderbird livery, initially on a circular routing that included Tucson, Phoenix and five other points. The CAB held hearings on the TWA deal shortly after. In July, the CAB examiner recommended against the transaction and in February 1947, the CAB Board itself voted to defer a decision on the transaction until the Board settled the general question of air service in Arizona and New Mexico, since that case was also open. The airline had also applied in that case to become a local service carrier, as such airlines were heavily subsidized at the time. So the TWA deal did not help Arizona Airways accelerate CAB certification. In June 1947, Arizona Airways and Bonanza Air Lines, then operating as a Nevada intrastate airline, proposed a merger, but no mention of it was later made in the CAB cases that certificated each airline as a feeder carrier.

===Apogee, financial distress and sale===
The airline expanded across Arizona the remainder of 1946 and into 1947 (see Destinations below). In July 1947 it experimented with air freight service to Kingman. However, the airline dropped some southern cities in the second half of 1947 for being unprofitable, and in January 1948, the airline was flying only on one northern route out of Phoenix. The airline enjoyed near constant news coverage, hardly a week went by without at least one article in the Arizona Republic, the state&#x27;s biggest newspaper, and usually several, often updating progress on the CAB cases. The newspaper often referred to the airline as the &quot;State Airway&quot; or similar. In February 1948, the CAB awarded Arizona Airways four routes from Phoenix, three within Arizona, one across New Mexico to El Paso, Texas. In the airline&#x27;s favor was it knew the territory and was backed by many of Arizona&#x27;s &quot;leading businessmen,&quot; showing the wisdom of statewide service and board representation. Certification was subject to upgrading airports to Federal standards (radios and other infrastructure) and shoring up its balance sheet, since Arizona Airways had few assets left. The CAB noted the company had covered operating losses with capital raising.

The airline stopped flying on March 1, 1948, Nelson saying it was to allow the company to transition to Federally-sanctioned flying. Communities duly upgraded airports. The CAB issued the certificate in June, but nothing happened thereafter because the airline could not raise more money without existing shareholders being severely diluted, and existing shareholders (who&#x27;d invested $335,000) didn&#x27;t want that. In May 1949, the CAB ordered Arizona Airways into operation by July 1. Finally, in late June Monarch Air Lines said it would buy Arizona Airways. The transaction was filed with the CAB, July 7, 1949. CAB approval took until April 10, 1950, complicated by the fact that Monarch was also purchasing Challenger Airlines. Acquisition terms were modest: 6,000 shares of Monarch stock and assumption of $150,000 in Arizona Airways liabilities. By contrast, Monarch issued about 30,000 shares for Challenger at $10.78 per share, so for an investment of $335,000 in Arizona Airways, shareholders got about $65,000 in Monarch equity. By April 26, Monarch was in possession of Arizona.

Meanwhile, Bonanza Air Lines received its own local service certification in June 1949, which was contingent on TWA transferring to Bonanza the same route (Las Vegas to Phoenix) that it had tried to sell to Arizona Airways in 1945. And in November 1949, Bonanza bought it, for $672.09, far less than the price TWA agreed with Arizona.

The three-way merger creating Frontier Airlines closed on June 1, 1950 and Frontier flew the first flight over the routes Arizona Airways received over two years earlier. Rocky Nelson became a Frontier Vice President but sadly died less than a year later at age 46.

==Fleet==
Though the airline was not operating, Arizona Airways contributed three DC-3s to the merger.

<text>Hermann Abeken (27 June 1820 – 27 April 1854) was a German political writer and statistician. He was the third son of Bernhard Rudolf Abeken.

Abelen was born in Osnabrück, Germany. He worked as merchant in New York City, but returned to Europe due to a chest affliction. A friend of his brother Friedrich, the young Count of Görz-Schliz, urged him to begin his law studies in Göttingen and Berlin. Beginning in autumn 1846 he began to write, influenced by his stay in the United States and statistical news.

In the summer of 1848 he was assigned head of the newly inaugurated statistical bureau at the Ministry of Stüve in Hannover. Abelen wrote for the daily press, where he supported the political decisions and goals of the Ministry. He died in Hannover.

<text>The Gare d&#x27;Orsay () is a former Paris railway station and hotel, built in 1900 to designs by Victor Laloux, Lucien Magne and Émile Bénard; it served as a terminus for the Chemin de Fer de Paris à Orléans (Paris–Orléans railway). It was the first electrified urban terminal station in the world, opened 28 May 1900, in time for the 1900 Exposition Universelle.

After its closure as a station, it reopened in December 1986 as the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, an art museum. The museum is currently served by the RER eponymous station.

==History==
===Palais d&#x27;Orsay===

In the early 19th century, the site was occupied by military barracks and the , a governmental building originally built for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The palace was erected over a period of 28 years, from 1810 to 1838, by the architects Jacques-Charles Bonnard and later Jacques Lacorné. After completion, the building was occupied by the Cour des Comptes and the Council of State.

After the fall of the French Second Empire in 1870, the Paris Commune briefly took power from March to May 1871. The archives, library, and artworks were moved to Palace of Versailles and eventually both the &quot;Conseil&quot; and the &quot;Cour des Comptes&quot; were rehoused in the Palais-Royal. On the night of 23–24 May 1871, the largely empty Palais d&#x27;Orsay was burned by soldiers of the Paris Commune, along with the Tuileries Palace and several other public buildings associated with Napoleon III, an event which was described by Émile Zola in his 1892 novel, &quot;La Débâcle&quot;. Following the fire, the burnt-out walls of the palace lay derelict for almost 30 years.

===Construction of the new station===
Towards the end of the 19th century, the Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris à Orléans (PO) railway company drew up plans to exploit the opportunities offered by the forthcoming Paris Exposition, which was due to open in 1900. The PO company&#x27;s railway line from Orléans in southwestern France, opened in 1840, terminated at the Paris Gare d&#x27;Orléans station (later renamed &quot;Gare d&#x27;Austerlitz&quot;). The terminus was unfavourably located in the 13th arrondissement, and the PO Company sought to open extend its lines from Austerlitz into central Paris. In 1897, the company won government approval to construct a new terminus on the site of the former Palais d&#x27;Orsay. A 550 V DC third rail railway line extension was constructed in a cut-and-cover tunnel along the left bank of the Seine from Austerlitz to the Quai d&#x27;Orsay.
The new terminal station, originally known as the &quot;Gare d&#x27;Orléans (Quai d&#x27;Orsay)&quot;, was in a culturally sensitive location, surrounded by elegant buildings such as the Hôtel des Invalides, the Palais de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur and the Palais du Louvre. The PO company consulted three architects — Lucien Magne, Émile Bénard and Victor Laloux — to propose plans for a building that would be sympathetic to its surroundings. Laloux&#x27;s scheme was successful, and the PO engaged him to design a monumental terminal station. Laloux designed the new Gare d&#x27;Orsay in a Beaux-Arts style, facing it with large stone blocks and concealing the industrial aspects of the station behind ornate façades, decorated with large stone personification statues representing the railway destinations of Bordeaux, Toulon and Nantes. The building included the 370-room Hotel Palais d&#x27;Orsay in the western and southern sides.
The train shed was built as a steel and glass arch over the platforms and passenger concourse, with a span of and measuring in length and wide over the 16 tracks. Passenger facilities incorporated many of the latest technological features, such as electric baggage lifts and escalators.

The electric track system was modelled on the Baltimore Belt Line electrified railway which had been completed in 1895. Engineering was carried out by Compagnie Francaise Thomson-Houston SA, a French subsidiary of the General Electric Company (GE), and the electric locomotives were manufactured by GE with running gear by Alco. The station design was the inspiration for the larger Penn Station in New York City when Alexander Cassatt, president of the Pennsylvania Railroad, traveled on his annual trip to Europe in 1901.
The station opened to passenger traffic on 28 May 1900.

===Decline and closure===

Advancements in the railways in the early 20th century led to the introduction of much longer mainline trains. Although the Gare d&#x27;Orsay offered a convenient central location, the site was restricted and there was no possibility of lengthening the platforms to accommodate the new, longer trains. The national rail operator SNCF was forced to terminate long-distance trains on the Orléans line at Gare d&#x27;Austerlitz and by 1939, the Gare d&#x27;Orsay had closed to long-distance traffic. The station continued to be served by suburban trains for some years afterwards. The Hotel Palais d&#x27;Orsay closed at the beginning of 1973.

Although largely disused, the Gare d&#x27;Orsay came into use for some noteworthy events. During the Second World War, the former station was used as a collection point for the dispatch of parcels to prisoners of war, and in 1945, the station was used as a reception centre for liberated French prisoners of war on their return to France; a plaque on the side of the building facing the River Seine commemorates this latter use. On 19 May 1958, General Charles de Gaulle used the opulent hotel ballroom for a press conference to announce his return to French national politics, ushering in the end of the French Fourth Republic.

The empty Gare d&#x27;Orsay also served as a film location, providing the setting for several films, including Orson Welles&#x27;s version of Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Trial&quot; (1962), and is a central location in Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;The Conformist&quot; (1970).

===Line re-opening===
The railway line terminating at Orsay was brought back into passenger service when a extension was built in a tunnel along the bank of the Seine, connecting the PO line to the Gare des Invalides, the terminus of the former Chemins de fer de l&#x27;Ouest line to Versailles. A new Quai d&#x27;Orsay underground station was built (now the Musée d&#x27;Orsay station). The new link opened on 26 September 1979, and today forms part of Line C of the Parisian commuter rail system, the Réseau Express Régional (RER).

==Museum==

In the 1960s, the appetite for replacing old buildings with modernist structures was gathering pace, and historic sites such as Les Halles market were being demolished. Plans were drawn up to demolish the Gare d&#x27;Orsay and replace it with a new building, and proposals for an airport, a government ministry building and a school of architecture were considered. Permission was granted to construct a hotel on the site, but in 1971 Jacques Duhamel, the minister of culture under President Georges Pompidou, intervened. The station building was in a sensitive location on the Seine facing the Tuileries Garden and the Louvre, and it was feared that a modern building would not fit in with the surrounding architecture. In 1973 the Gare d&#x27;Orsay was designated a protected Monument historique.
At the time, the French Ministry of Culture was facing problems with a lack of exhibition space, particularly in the Musée du Jeu de Paume and the Louvre. With the opening of the Centre Pompidou in 1977 to house modern art, it was felt that there was a lack of provision for exhibiting art of the 19th century. The paintings curator of the Louvre, Michel Laclotte, proposed the creation of a new museum to display 19th century artworks from the Post-romanticism era up to Fauvism, and in particular the large collection of Impressionist art from the Jeu de Paume.

The project to convert the disused railway station into a museum was announced in 1978 by President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing. The architects for the conversion were the architects&#x27; firm ACT led by . The Italian architect Gae Aulenti developed the interior design of the gallery. The building reopened as the Musée d&#x27;Orsay in December 1986. The former train shed now serves as the grand hall of the museum, with large works by sculptors such as Auguste Rodin, Jean-Joseph Perraud and Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux on permanent display, overlooked by the large, ornate station clock. The former railway hotel now holds the paintings collection, displaying works by Georges Seurat, Paul Cézanne, Claude Monet and Vincent van Gogh among others.

<text>Wilhelm Ludwig Abeken (30 April 1813 – 29 January 1843) was a German archaeologist.

He was born in Osnabrück, the eldest son of Bernhard Rudolf Abeken.

Abeken learned archeology under Eduard Gerhard himself. In 1836, he went to Rome to study the Italy of the pre-Roman times. He collected materials for a mythology of Italy and a monography on the Capitol. However, only his work &quot;Mittelitalien vor den Zeiten der römischen Herrschaft, nach den Denkmälern&quot; (1843) was ever finished. A fever forced him to return to Munich, where he died at the age of 29.

<text>A training manual is a document, a book or booklet of instructions and information, used as an aid to learning a task, skill, or job. Training manuals are widely used, including in business and the military.

A training manual may be particularly useful as:
* an introduction to subject matter prior to training
* an outline to be followed during training
* a reference to subject matter after training
* a general reference document
* a system to reference

A training manual may form an important part of a formal training program. For example, it may help ensure consistency in presentation of content. It may also ensure that all or most training information on skills, processes, and other information necessary to perform tasks is together in one place.

Training manuals can be designed to be used as:
*Workbooks – used in training sessions to provide basic information, examples and exercises.
*Self-paced guides: designed for trainees to work through on their own.
*Reference manuals: for containing detailed information on processes and procedures.
*Handouts: provide general information to support training done during the session.
*Job aids: provide step-by-step instructions to be used in the .

<text>The Whitworth is an art gallery in Manchester, England, containing over 60,000 items in its collection. The gallery is located in Whitworth Park and is part of the University of Manchester.

In 2015, the Whitworth reopened after it was transformed by a £15 million capital redevelopment that doubled its exhibition spaces, restored period features and opened itself up to its surrounding park. The gallery received more than 440,000 visitors in its first year and was awarded the Art Fund&#x27;s Museum of the Year prize in 2015.

==History==
The gallery was founded in 1889 by Robert Dukinfield Darbishire with a donation from Sir Joseph Whitworth, as &quot;The Whitworth Institute and Park&quot;. The first building was completed in 1908. In 1958, the gallery became part of the Victoria University of Manchester.

In October 1974, the gallery became a Grade II listed building.

In October 1995, the mezzanine court in the centre of the building was opened. The new gallery, designed chiefly for the display of sculpture, won a RIBA regional award. In 2010, the art gallery received 
172,000 visitors, making it one of Greater Manchester&#x27;s 10 most-visited tourist attractions.

In February 2015, the Whitworth reopened after a £15 million capital redevelopment and received over 440,000 visitors in its first reopening year. It was shortlisted for the Stirling Prize and won the Art Fund&#x27;s Museum of the Year in 2015.

===2003 theft===
On 26 April 2003, three paintings thought to be worth a total of £4 million — Van Gogh&#x27;s &quot;The Fortification of Paris with Houses&quot;, Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Poverty&quot; and Gauguin&#x27;s &quot;Tahitian Landscape&quot; — were stolen from the gallery. After an anonymous tip-off, they were found rolled up in a nearby public toilet with a note claiming that the motive of the theft was to highlight poor security at the gallery. The paintings were subsequently put back on display after minor repair work.

==Architecture==
The Grade II listed gallery was built between 1895 and 1900 in a free Jacobean style to the designs of J.W. Beaumont. The gallery consisting of two storeys and a basement is constructed of red brick with bands and dressings of matching terracotta and has green slate roofs. Its nine-bay main range has two towers and a large projecting semi-circular porch with a screen of paired stone Ionic columns and a stone frieze below a balustraded parapet.

===Refurbishment and extension===

An architectural competition was launched by RIBA Competitions to design an extension in 2008 and funding was secured in February 2011. In September 2013, the gallery closed for refurbishment and extension works. The £15 million redevelopment was supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund and the University of Manchester. The refurbishment works, undertaken by architects MUMA envisaged the gallery reopening to the public by summer 2014, but complications delayed the opening.

The development includes expanded gallery areas, a learning studio, study centre, an art garden and café. Developers have constructed a glass, stainless steel and brick extension consisting of two wings which extend into Whitworth Park from the back of the gallery building. The wings are connected by a glass promenade. The extension means the gallery is a third larger than previously.

The extension, which opened on 14 February 2015, doubled the gallery&#x27;s public space. It provides more space for displaying the more than 60,000 items in the gallery&#x27;s collection and links the building to Whitworth Park.

The refurbishment and extension work resulted in the development winning a RIBA National Award in 2015 and subsequently being shortlisted for the RIBA Stirling Prize.

==Collections==
The Whitworth has notable collections of watercolours, sculptures, wallpapers and textiles. It includes major historic works by Thomas Gainsborough, Alexander and John Robert Cozens, and Thomas Girtin.

Some of the exhibitions at the Whitworth are made up from works in the permanent collection however to ensure proper conservation of the artworks the Whitworth do not have any artworks on permanent display. 

The gallery also focuses on modern and contemporary artists, and the art collections include works by Degas, van Gogh, Gauguin, Pissarro, Picasso, Moholy-Nagy, Paul Klee, Walter Sickert, Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, Ford Madox Brown, Eduardo Paolozzi, Francis Bacon, William Blake, David Hockney, L. S. Lowry, and a fine collection of works by J. M. W. Turner. One of its most famous works is the marble sculpture &quot;Genesis&quot; (1929–31) by Sir Jacob Epstein. It also houses the Musgrave Kinley Outsider Art Collection.

==Directors==
In June 2017, Maria Balshaw stepped down as the director to take up her role as the director of the Tate. Nick Merriman then became acting interim director of the Whitworth.

On 11 October 2018, it was announced that Alistair Hudson would be the new director of the Manchester Art Gallery and the Whitworth. Hudson, previously director at the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art (MIMA), is a co-director of the Asociación de Arte Útil.

Sook-Kyng Lee became director and took up her role at the Whitworth in August 2023 and become Honorary Professor of Transcultural Curating at the University of Manchester.

<doc id="749740" wikidata="Q15524913" url="?curid=749740" title="John Leach (judge)">
<text>Sir John Leach (28 August 1760 – 14 September 1834) was an English judge, and Master of the Rolls.

==Life==
The son of Richard Leach, a coppersmith of Bedford, he was born in that town on 28 August 1760. After leaving Bedford School he became a pupil of Sir Robert Taylor the architect. In his office he is said to have made the working drawings for the erection of Stone Buildings, which are still preserved at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and to have designed Howletts, in the parish of Bekesbourne, Kent. On the recommendation of his old fellow-pupil, Samuel Pepys Cockerell, and other friends, Leach abandoned architecture for the law, and was admitted a student of the Middle Temple on 26 January 1785.

Having studied of conveyancing and equity drafting in the chambers of William Alexander, he was called to the bar in Hilary term 1790, and joined the home circuit and Surrey sessions. In 1792 he was engaged as counsel in the Seaford election petition, and in 1795 was elected recorder of that Cinque port. Having previously purchased the Pelham interest, he unsuccessfully contested the constituency against Charles Rose Ellis and Ellis&#x27;s cousin, George Ellis, at the general election in May 1796. In 1800 Leach gave up all common law work, and confined himself to the equity courts, where his pleadings and terse style of speaking secured him an extensive business.

At a by-election in July 1806, he was returned for Seaford, but owing to the prorogation did not take his seat in that parliament. He was again returned at the general election in the following October, and continued to represent Seaford until his retirement from parliamentary life in 1816. In Hilary term 1807 Leach was made a king&#x27;s counsel, and was subsequently elected a bencher of the Middle Temple. Leach spoke rarely in the House of Commons. In March 1809 he defended the conduct of the Duke of York and Albany, and on 31 December 1810 supported William Lamb&#x27;s amendment to the first regency resolution (ib. xviii. 532–45). In 1811 he carried through the House of Commons the Foreign Ministers&#x27; Pension Bill. On 15 February 1813 he strongly protested against the bill for the creation of a vice-chancellor, the effect of which he maintained would be to make the lord chancellor a political rather than a judicial character; and on 31 May 1815 he strenuously opposed Lord Althorp&#x27;s motion for an inquiry into the expenditure of £100,000 granted by parliament for the outfit of the Prince Regent.

Early in February 1816, Leach vacated his seat in the House of Commons by accepting the Chiltern Hundreds, and was immediately afterwards appointed by the Prince Regent as Chancellor of the Duchy of Cornwall. In August 1817 he became chief justice of Chester, in succession to Sir William Garrow. Resigning these posts, he succeeded Sir Thomas Plumer as vice-chancellor of England in January 1818, and having been sworn a member of the Privy Council on 30 December 1817, was knighted in the following month. On John Copley becoming lord chancellor Leach was appointed master of the rolls (3 May 1827), and, by a commission dated 5 May 1827, was made deputy-speaker of the House of Lords. By an act of parliament passed in August 1833 Leach became, by virtue of his office as Master of the Rolls, a member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

He died at Simpson&#x27;s Hotel in Edinburgh on 14 September 1834, aged 74, and was buried on 20 September 1834, in William Adam&#x27;s mausoleum in Greyfriars Kirkyard.

==Assessment==
Leach&#x27;s decisions were lucid and brief, but as he often decided on his own judgment in preference to that of his predecessors, they were not infrequently over-ruled. His demeanour on the bench brought him into constant collision with members of the bar. While he was master of the rolls the customary evening sittings of the court were abandoned, and on 22 June 1829 the practice of sitting in the daytime began. Though Leach was professedly a Whig when he entered Parliament, he adopted the politics of the Regent, whose confidential adviser he had become. At his instigation the Milan commission was instituted in 1818 to investigate the conduct of the Princess of Wales; he was strongly in favour of a divorce. Some of Leach&#x27;s equity pleadings, signed &#x27;J. L.,&#x27; were printed in F. M. Van Heythuysen&#x27;s &#x27;Equity Draftsman&#x27; (London, 1816, 8vo). 
His speech of 31 December 1810 on the regency resolutions was published in 1811 (London, 8vo, second edition). 
He was created D.C.L. by the university of Oxford on 5 July 1810.

==Family==
He never married. His nephew, Richard Howell Leach, a son of his youngest brother, Thomas Leach, was the senior chancery registrar from 1868 to 1882.

<doc id="749745" wikidata="Q4692577" url="?curid=749745" title="Aging brain">
<text>Aging of the brain is a process of transformation of the brain in older age, including changes all individuals experience and those of illness (including unrecognised illness). Usually this refers to humans.

Since life extension is only pertinent if accompanied by health span extension, and, more importantly, by preserving brain health and cognition, finding rejuvenating approaches that act simultaneously in peripheral tissues and in brain function is a key strategy for development of rejuvenating technology.

Aging is a major risk factor for most common neurodegenerative diseases, including mild cognitive impairment, dementias including Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease. While much research has focused on diseases of aging, there are few informative studies on the molecular biology of the aging brain (usually spelled ageing brain in British English) in the absence of neurodegenerative disease or the neuropsychological profile of healthy older adults. However, research suggests that the aging process is associated with several structural, chemical, and functional changes in the brain as well as a host of neurocognitive changes. Recent reports in model organisms suggest that as organisms age, there are distinct changes in the expression of genes at the single neuron level. This page is an overview of the changes associated with human brain aging, including aging without concomitant diseases.

==Structural changes==

Aging entails many physical, biological, chemical, and psychological changes and the brain is no exception to this phenomenon. These various changes have attempted to be mapped by conceptual models like the Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition (STAC) in 2009. The STAC model looks at factors like neural changes to the white matter, dopamine depletion, shrinkage, and cortical thinning. CT scans have found that the cerebral ventricles expand as a function of age. More recent MRI studies have reported age-related regional decreases in cerebral volume. Regional volume reduction is not uniform; some brain regions shrink at a rate of up to 1% per year, whereas others remain relatively stable until the end of the life-span. The brain is very complex, and is composed of many different areas and types of tissue, or matter. The different functions of different tissues in the brain may be more or less susceptible to age-induced changes. The brain matter can be broadly classified as either grey matter, or white matter. Grey matter consists of cell bodies in the cortex and subcortical nuclei. White matter consists of tightly packed myelinated axons connecting the neurons to each other and with the periphery.

===Loss of neural circuits and brain plasticity===
Brain plasticity refers to the brain&#x27;s ability to change structure and function. This ties into the common phrase, &quot;if you don&#x27;t use it, you lose it,&quot; which is another way of saying, if you do not use it, your brain will devote less somatotopic space for it. One proposed mechanism for the observed age-related plasticity deficits in animals is the result of age-induced alterations in calcium regulation. The changes in the organism&#x27;s abilities to handle calcium will ultimately influence neuronal firing and the ability to propagate action potentials, which in turn would affect the ability of the brain to alter its structure or function (i.e. its plastic nature). Due to the complexity of the brain, with all of its structures and functions, it is logical to assume that some areas would be more vulnerable to aging than others. Two circuits worth mentioning here are the hippocampal and neocortical circuits. It has been suggested that age-related cognitive decline is due in part not to neuronal death but to synaptic alterations. Evidence in support of this idea from animal work has also suggested that this cognitive deficit is due to functional and biochemical factors such as changes in enzymatic activity, chemical messengers, or gene expression in cortical circuits.

===Thinning of the cortex===

Advances in MRI technology have provided the ability to see the brain structure in great detail in an easy, non-invasive manner &quot;in vivo&quot;. Bartzokis &quot;et al.&quot;, has noted that there is a decrease in grey matter volume between adulthood and old age, whereas white matter volume was found to increase from age 19–40, and decline after this age. Studies using Voxel-based morphometry have identified areas such as the insula and superior parietal gyri as being especially vulnerable to age-related losses in grey matter of older adults. Sowell &quot;et al.&quot;, reported that the first 6 decades of an individual&#x27;s life were correlated with the most rapid decreases in grey matter density, and this occurred over dorsal, frontal, and parietal lobes on both interhemispheric and lateral brain surfaces. It is also worth noting that areas such as the cingulate gyrus, and occipital cortex surrounding the calcarine sulcus appear exempt from this decrease in grey matter density over time. Age effects on grey matter density in the posterior temporal cortex appear more predominantly in the left versus right hemisphere, and were confined to posterior language cortices. Certain language functions such as word retrieval and production were found to be located to more anterior language cortices, and deteriorate as a function of age. Sowell et al., also reported that these anterior language cortices were found to mature and decline earlier than the more posterior language cortices. It has also been found that the width of sulcus not only increases with age, but also with cognitive decline in the elderly.

===Morphology and microstructure===
Age-related decrease in gray matter volume was the largest contribution to changes in brain volume. Moreover, neuronal density appears to decrease, white matter microstructure gets altered and energy metabolism in the cerebellum gets altered. General cortical atrophy occurs in aging and e.g. the caudate nucleus volume appears to decrease.

===Age-related neuronal morphology===
There is converging evidence from cognitive neuroscientists around the world that age-induced cognitive deficits may not be due to neuronal loss or cell death, but rather may be the result of small region-specific changes to the morphology of neurons. Studies by Duan et al., have shown that dendritic arbors and dendritic spines of cortical pyramidal neurons decrease in size and/or number in specific regions and layers of human and non-human primate cortex as a result of age (Duan &quot;et al.&quot;, 2003; morph). A 46% decrease in spine number and spine density has been reported in humans older than 50 compared with younger individuals. An electron microscopy study in monkeys reported a 50% loss in spines on the apical dendritic tufts of pyramidal cells in prefrontal cortex of old animals (27–32 years old) compared with young ones (6–9 years old).

====Neurofibrillary tangles====
Age-related neuropathologies such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, diabetes, hypertension and arteriosclerosis make it difficult to distinguish the normal patterns of aging. One of the important differences between normal aging and pathological aging is the location of neurofibrillary tangles. Neurofibrillary tangles are composed of paired helical filaments (PHF). In normal, non-demented aging, the number of tangles in each affected cell body is relatively low and restricted to the olfactory nucleus, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala and entorhinal cortex. As the non-demented individual ages, there is a general increase in the density of tangles, but no significant difference in where tangles are found.

The other main neurodegenerative contributor commonly found in the brain of patients with AD is amyloid plaques. However, unlike tangles, plaques have not been found to be a consistent feature of normal aging.

===Role of oxidative stress===

Cognitive impairment has been attributed to oxidative stress, inflammatory reactions and changes in the cerebral microvasculature. The exact impact of each of these mechanisms in affecting cognitive aging is unknown. Oxidative stress is the most controllable risk factor and is the best understood. The online Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary defines oxidative stress as, &quot;physiological stress on the body that is caused by the cumulative damage done by free radicals inadequately neutralized by antioxidants and that is held to be associated with aging.&quot; Hence oxidative stress is the damage done to the cells by free radicals that have been released from the oxidation process.

Compared to other tissues in the body, the brain is deemed unusually sensitive to oxidative damage. Increased oxidative damage has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases, mild cognitive impairment and individual differences in cognition in healthy elderly people. In &#x27;normal aging&#x27;, the brain is undergoing oxidative stress in a multitude of ways. The main contributors include protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation and oxidative modifications in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Oxidative stress can damage DNA replication and inhibit repair through many complex processes, including telomere shortening in DNA components. Each time a somatic cell replicates, the telomeric DNA component shortens. As telomere length is partly inheritable, there are individual differences in the age of onset of cognitive decline.

===DNA damage===
At least 25 studies have demonstrated that DNA damage accumulates with age in the mammalian brain. This DNA damage includes the oxidized nucleoside 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), single- and double-strand breaks, DNA-protein cross-links and malondialdehyde adducts (reviewed in Bernstein et al.). Increasing DNA damage with age has been reported in the brains of the mouse, rat, gerbil, rabbit, dog, and human. Young 4-day-old rats have about 3,000 single-strand breaks and 156 double-strand breaks per neuron, whereas in rats older than 2 years the level of damage increases to about 7,400 single-strand breaks and 600 double-strand breaks per neuron.

Lu et al. studied the transcriptional profiles of the human frontal cortex of individuals ranging from 26 to 106 years of age. This led to the identification of a set of genes whose expression was altered after age 40. They further found that the promoter sequences of these particular genes accumulated oxidative DNA damage, including 8-OHdG, with age (see DNA damage theory of aging). They concluded that DNA damage may reduce the expression of selectively vulnerable genes involved in learning, memory and neuronal survival, initiating a pattern of brain aging that starts early in life.

== Immune system and fluids ==
Blood–brain barrier permeability, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and gut microbiota-induced systemic chronic inflammation appear to be linked and interact with aging, e.g. as gut microbiota homeostasis could be disturbed by increasing age. According to a review, neuroinflammatory changes, &quot;including microglial activation and production of inflammatory cytokines&quot;, occur with normal aging.

===Fluids===

Cerebral blood flow was shown to decrease 0.3-0.5% per year in healthy ageing. An efficiently functioning glymphatic system, involved in waste clearance, may be important for maintaining brain health and its transport efficiency appears to be declining with aging. Factors in the circulation have been shown to modulate ageing and to rejuvenate the brain.

== Chemical changes ==

In addition to the structural changes that the brain incurs with age, the aging process also entails a broad range of biochemical changes. More specifically, neurons communicate with each other via specialized chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. Several studies have identified a number of these neurotransmitters, as well as their receptors, that exhibit a marked alteration in different regions of the brain as part of the normal aging process.

=== Dopamine ===
An overwhelming number of studies have reported age-related changes in dopamine synthesis, binding sites, and number of receptors. Studies using positron emission tomography (PET) in living human subjects have shown a significant age-related decline in dopamine synthesis, notably in the striatum and extrastriatal regions (excluding the midbrain). Significant age-related decreases in dopamine receptors D1, D2, and D3 have also been highly reported. A general decrease in D1 and D2 receptors has been shown, and more specifically a decrease of D1 and D2 receptor binding in the caudate nucleus and putamen. A general decrease in D1 receptor density has also been shown to occur with age. Significant age-related declines in dopamine receptors, D2 and D3 were detected in the anterior cingulate cortex, frontal cortex, lateral temporal cortex, hippocampus, medial temporal cortex, amygdala, medial thalamus, and lateral thalamus. One study also indicated a significant inverse correlation between dopamine binding in the occipital cortex and age. Postmortem studies also show that the number of D1 and D2 receptors decline with age in both the caudate nucleus and the putamen, although the ratio of these receptors did not show age-related changes. The loss of dopamine with age is thought to be responsible for many neurological symptoms that increase in frequency with age, such as decreased arm swing and increased rigidity. Changes in dopamine levels may also cause age-related changes in cognitive flexibility.

===Serotonin===

Decreasing levels of different serotonin receptors and the serotonin transporter (5-HTT), have also been shown to occur with age. Studies conducted using PET methods on humans, in vivo, show that levels of the 5-HT2 receptor in the caudate nucleus, putamen, and frontal cerebral cortex, decline with age. A decreased binding capacity of the 5-HT2 receptor in the frontal cortex was also found, as well as a decreased binding capacity of the serotonin transporter (5-HHT) in the thalamus and the midbrain. Postmortem studies on humans have indicated decreased binding capacities of serotonin and a decrease in the number of S1 receptors in the frontal cortex and hippocampus as well as a decrease in affinity in the putamen.

===Glutamate===
Glutamate is another neurotransmitter that tends to decrease with age. Studies have shown older subjects to have lower glutamate concentration in the motor cortex compared to younger subjects. A significant age-related decline especially in the parietal gray matter, basal ganglia, and to a lesser degree, the frontal white matter, has also been noted. Although these levels were studied in the normal human brain, the parietal and basal ganglia regions are often affected in degenerative brain diseases associated with aging and it has therefore been suggested that brain glutamate may be useful as a marker of brain diseases that are affected by aging.

==Neuropsychological changes==
===Changes in orientation===
Orientation is defined as the awareness of self in relation to one&#x27;s surroundings. Often orientation is examined by distinguishing whether a person has a sense of time, place, and person. Deficits in orientation are one of the most common symptoms of brain disease, hence tests of orientation are included in almost all medical and neuropsychological evaluations. While research has primarily focused on levels of orientation among clinical populations, a small number of studies have examined whether there is a normal decline in orientation among healthy aging adults. Results have been somewhat inconclusive. Some studies suggest that orientation does not decline over the lifespan. For example, in one study 92% of normal elderly adults (65–84 years) presented with perfect or near perfect orientation. However some data suggest that mild changes in orientation may be a normal part of aging. For example, Sweet and colleagues concluded that &quot;older persons with normal, healthy memory may have mild orientation difficulties. In contrast, younger people with normal memory have virtually no orientation problems&quot; (p. 505). So although current research suggests that normal aging is not usually associated with significant declines in orientation, mild difficulties may be a part of normal aging and not necessarily a sign of a particular pathology.

===Changes in attention===
Many older adults notice a decline in their attentional abilities. Attention is a broad construct that refers to &quot;the cognitive ability that allows us to deal with the inherent processing limitations of the human brain by selecting information for further processing&quot;. Since the human brain has limited resources, people use their attention to zone in on specific stimuli and block out others.

If older adults have fewer attentional resources than younger adults, we would expect that when two tasks must be carried out at the same time, older adults&#x27; performance will decline more than that of younger adults. However, a large review of studies on cognition and aging suggest that this hypothesis has not been wholly supported. While some studies have found that older adults have a more difficult time encoding and retrieving information when their attention is divided, other studies have not found meaningful differences from younger adults. Similarly, one might expect older adults to do poorly on tasks of sustained attention, which measure the ability to attend to and respond to stimuli for an extended period of time. However, studies suggest that sustained attention shows no decline with age. Results suggest that sustained attention increases in early adulthood and then remains relatively stable, at least to the middle of the eighth decade of life. More research is needed on how normal aging impacts attention after age eighty.

It is worth noting that there are factors other than true attentional abilities that might relate to difficulty paying attention. For example, it is possible that sensory deficits impact older adults&#x27; attentional abilities. In other words, impaired hearing or vision may make it more difficult for older adults to do well on tasks of visual and verbal attention.

=== Changes in memory ===

Many different types of memory have been identified in humans, such as declarative memory (including episodic memory and semantic memory), working memory, spatial memory, and procedural memory. Studies done, have found that memory functions, more specifically those associated with the medial temporal lobe are especially vulnerable to age-related decline. A number of studies utilizing a variety of methods such as histological, structural imaging, functional imaging, and receptor binding have supplied converging evidence that the frontal lobes and frontal-striatal dopaminergic pathways are especially affected by age-related processes resulting in memory changes.

=== Changes in language ===
Changes in performance on verbal tasks, as well as the location, extent, and signal intensity of BOLD signal changes measured with functional MRI, vary in predictable patterns with age. For example, behavioral changes associated with age include compromised performance on tasks related to word retrieval, comprehension of sentences with high syntactic and/or working memory demands, and production of such sentences.

=== Brain activation patterns ===
The left inferior frontal junction and left anterior cuneus/precuneus were the only regions in a larger set of regions associated with executive functions, that consistently showed age differences in brain activity.

=== Changes in learning and behavioral flexibility ===

Learning is often more efficient in children and takes longer or is more difficult with age. A study using neuroimaging identified rapid neurotransmitter GABA boosting as a major potential explanation-component for why that is.

Behavioral flexibility can refer to efficiently and appropriately adapting to different situations and changing environmental demands, including the speed of adaptation, and to the capacity to develop solutions to novel problems or novel solutions to old problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/s41583-021-00428-w&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Studies indicate late-stage aging, and/or late-life dementias, decreases behavioral flexibility and impair deliberation about courses of action.

== Genetic changes ==

Variation in the effects of aging among individuals can be attributed to both genetic, health, and environmental factors. As in so many other science disciplines, the nature versus nurture debate is an ongoing conflict in the field of cognitive neuroscience. The search for genetic factors has always been an important aspect in trying to understand neuropathological processes. Research focused on discovering the genetic component in developing Autosomal Dominant (AD) has also contributed greatly to the understanding the genetics behind normal or &quot;non-pathological&quot; aging.

: Autosomal Dominant (AD) - Autosomal dominant is a pattern of inheritance characteristic of some genetic disorders. &quot;Autosomal&quot; means that the gene in question is located on one of the numbered, or non-sex, chromosomes. &quot;Dominant&quot; means that a single copy of the mutated gene (from one parent) is enough to cause the disorder.

The human brain shows a decline in function and a change in gene expression. This modulation in gene expression may be due to oxidative DNA damage at promoter regions in the genome. Genes that are down-regulated over the age of 40 include:

* GluR1 AMPA receptor subunit
* NMDA R2A receptor subunit (involved in learning)
* Subunits of the GABA-A receptor
* Genes involved in long-term potentiation e.g. calmodulin 1 and CaM Kinase II alpha
* Calcium signaling genes
* Synaptic plasticity genes
* Synaptic vesicle release and recycling genes

Genes that are upregulated include:

* Genes associated with stress response and DNA repair
* Antioxidant defence

== Measurement ==
===Epigenetic age analysis of brain regions===
The cerebellum is the youngest brain region (and probably body part) in centenarians according to an epigenetic biomarker of tissue age known as epigenetic clock: it is about 15 years younger than expected in a centenarian. By contrast, all brain regions and brain cells appear to have roughly the same epigenetic age in subjects who are younger than 80. These findings suggest that the cerebellum is better protected from aging effects, which in turn could explain why the cerebellum exhibits fewer neuropathological hallmarks of age related dementias compared to other brain regions.

===Other===
There is research and development of biomarkers of aging, detection systems and software systems to measure biological age of the brain. For example, a deep learning software using anatomic magnetic resonance images estimated brain age with relatively high accuracy, including detecting early signs of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and varying neuroanatomical patterns of neurological aging.

==Delaying the effects of aging==
The current state of biomedical technology does not allow to stop and reverse aging. However, one may potentially delay the effects and severity of its symptoms.
While there is no consensus of efficacy, the following are reported as delaying cognitive decline:
* High level of education
* Physical exercise
* Staying intellectually engaged, i.e. reading and mental activities (such as crossword puzzles)
* Maintaining social and friendship networks&lt;ref name=&quot;10.3233/JAD-201462&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maintaining a healthy diet, including omega-3 fatty acids, protective antioxidants and e.g. flavonols-containing foods as well as potentially anthocyanins- and flavanones-containing ones as in, more generally, Mediterranean diet patterns
* Limiting stress, adequate sleep, managing sensory impairments, smoking cessation, limiting alcohol use, brain protection, treating cardiovascular risk factors
* Avoiding anticholinergic medications
* A number of are under investigation, including nicotinamide riboside
* Caloric restriction and intermittent fasting&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.cmet.2018.05.011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* The microbiome also plays a role. Scientists have shown that transplantation of fecal microbiota from young donor mice into aged recipient mice substantially rejuvenates brain biomarkers of the latter, complementing similar results of a 2020 study. Diet and other factors influence the microbiome. Probiotics such as of &quot;L. plantarum&quot; may also have relevant effects.

=== Cognitive reserve ===
The ability of an individual to demonstrate attenuated cognitive signs of aging despite an aging brain is called cognitive reserve. This hypothesis suggests that two patients might have the same brain pathology, with one person experiencing noticeable clinical symptoms, while the other continues to function relatively normally. Studies of cognitive reserve explore the specific biological, genetic and environmental differences which make some people more resistant to cognitive decline than others. 

Intellectual quotients derived from psychometric testing have been identified as valuable proxy measures of cognitive reserve, with higher scores relative to the mean being associated with slower rates of cognitive decline. However, the rate of decline in some cognitive subdomains, such as processing speed, may be less affected by premorbid IQ. The degree of association between IQ and cognitive reserve may vary between different types of dementia.

===Research===
====&quot;Super Agers&quot;====

Longitudinal research studies have recently conducted genetic analyses of centenarians and their offspring to identify protective factors against the negative effects of aging. In particular, the CETP gene is linked to prevention of cognitive decline and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Specifically, valine CETP homozygotes but not heterozygotes experienced a relative 51% less decline in memory compared to a reference group after adjusting for demographic factors and APOE status.

====Nun Study====

A study funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) began in 1986 and followed a group of 678 Roman Catholic sisters and recorded the effects of aging. The researchers used autobiographical essays collected as the nuns joined their Sisterhood. Findings suggest that early idea density, defined by number of ideas expressed and use of complex prepositions in these essays, was a significant predictor of lower risk for developing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in old age. Lower idea density was found to be significantly associated with lower brain weight, higher cerebral atrophy, and more neurofibrillary tangles.

In 1994, Religious Orders Study has begun. Its initial funding was also provided by NIA.

====Hypothalamus inflammation and GnRH====

In a 2013 study, it was suggested that the inflammation of the hypothalamus may be connected to our overall aging bodies. They focused on the activation of the protein complex NF-κB in mice test subjects, which showed increased activation as mice test subjects aged in the study. This activation not only affects aging, but affects a hormone known as GnRH, which has shown new anti-aging properties when injected into mice outside the hypothalamus, while causing the opposite effect when injected into the hypothalamus. It&#x27;ll be some time before this can be applied to humans in a meaningful way, as more studies on this pathway are necessary to understand the mechanics of GnRH&#x27;s anti-aging properties.

====Inflammation====
A study found that myeloid cells are drivers of a maladaptive inflammation element of brain-ageing in mice and that this can be reversed or prevented via inhibition of their EP2 signalling.

====Cerebrospinal fluid====
A study showed that infusing the nourishing cerebrospinal fluid from around brain cells of young mice into aged brains rejuvenates aspects of the brain, proving that it play a role in brain aging and &quot;inter alia&quot; identifying a protein FGF17 as a key target for potential therapeutics, including for anti-aging.

The subarachnoidal lymphatic-like membrane, whose discovery was reported around 2023, likely plays a role in cerebrospinal fluid functions and, as both a protective barrier and a host of immune cells that monitor the brain for infection and inflammation, appears to be substantially involved in major brain diseases and brain aging. It is &quot;the host for a large population of myeloid cells [], the number of which increases in response to inflammation and aging&quot;.

== Aging disparities ==
For certain demographics, the effects of normal cognitive aging are especially pronounced. Differences in cognitive aging might be tied to the lack of or reduced access to medical care and, as a result, suffer disproportionately from negative health outcomes. As the global population grows, diversifies, and grays, there is an increasing need to understand these inequities.

=== Race ===

==== African Americans ====
In the United States, Black and African American demographics disproportionately experience metabolic dysfunction with age. This has many downstream effects, but the most prominent of these is the toll on cardiovascular health. Metabolite profiles of the healthy aging index - a score that assesses neurocognitive function, among other correlates of health through the years - are associated with cardiovascular disease. Healthy cardiovascular function is critical for maintaining neurocognitive efficiency into old age. Attention, verbal learning, and cognitive set ability are related to diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride levels, and HDL cholesterol levels, respectively.

==== Latinos ====
In the US, the Latino demographic is most likely to develop metabolic syndrome - the combination of high blood pressure, high blood sugar, elevated triglyceride levels, and abdominal obesity - which not only increases the risk of cardiac events and type 2 diabetes but also is associated with lower neurocognitive function during midlife. This takes place even though life expectancy for Latinos in the US is higher than for white and black.

Among different Latin heritages, frequency of the dementia-predisposing ε4 allele of apoE4 gene was highest for Caribbean Latinos (Cubans, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, 12.6–17.5 %) and lowest among mainland Latinos (Mexicans, Central Americans, and South Americans, 11.0–11.2 %). At the same time, frequency of the neuroprotective ε2 allele was also highest for Caribbean Latinos (5.2–8.6 %) and lowest for those of mainland heritage (2.9–3.9 %). Among mainland Latinos, the most prevalent is the &quot;median&quot; ε3 allele: 85.2–86.2 % compared to 73.9–81.5% among Caribbean Latinos.

==== Indigenous Peoples ====
Indigenous populations are often understudied in research. Reviews of current literature studying natives in Australia, Brazil, Canada, and the United States from participants aged 45 to 94 years old reveal varied prevalence rates for cognitive impairment not related to dementia, from 4.4% to 17.7%. These results can be interpreted in the context of culturally biased neurocognitive tests, preexisting health conditions, poor access to healthcare, lower educational attainment, and/or old age.

=== Sex ===
Compared to their male counterparts, women&#x27;s scores on the mini–mental state examination (MMSE) tend to decline at slightly faster rates with age. Males with mild cognitive impairment tend to show more microstructural damage than females with MCI, but seem to have a greater cognitive reserve due to larger absolute brain size and neuronal density. As a result, women tend to manifest symptoms of cognitive decline at lower thresholds than men do. This effect seems to be moderated by educational attainment - higher education is associated with later diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment as neuropathological load increases. Currently there are no known studies to identify a characteristic pattern of cognitive decline with age in transgender people.

=== Socioeconomic factors ===
Socioeconomic status is the interaction between social and economic factors. It has been demonstrated that socio-demographic factors can be used to predict cognitive profiles within older individuals to some extent.  This may be because families of higher socioeconomic status (SES) are equipped to provide their children with resources early on to facilitate cognitive development. For children in families of low SES, relatively small changes in parental income were associated with large changes in brain surface area; these losses were seen in areas associated with language, reading, executive functions, and spatial skills. Meanwhile, for children in families of high SES, small changes in parental income were associated with small changes in surface area within these regions. With respect to global cortical thickness, low SES children showed a curvilinear decrease in thickness with age while those of high SES demonstrated a steeper linear decline, suggesting that synaptic pruning is more efficient in the latter group. This trend was especially evident in the left fusiform and left superior temporal gyri - critical language and literacy supporting areas.

A study showed that 50+ aged users of the dietary program SNAP &quot;had about 2 fewer years of cognitive aging over a 10-year period compared with non-users&quot; despite it having nearly no conditions for the sustainability and healthiness of the food products purchased with the coupons (or coupon-credits).

<text>Aleksandra Aleksandrovna Ekster (née Grigorovich; ; ; 18 January 1882 – 17 March 1949), also known as Alexandra Exter, was a Russian and French painter and designer.

As a young woman, her studio in Kiev attracted all the city&#x27;s creative luminaries, and she became a figure of the Paris salons, mixing with Picasso, Braque and others. She is identified with the Russian/Ukrainian avant-garde, as a Cubo-futurist, Constructivist, and influencer of the Art Deco movement. She was the teacher of several School of Paris artists such as Abraham Mintchine, Isaac Frenkel Frenel and the film directors Grigori Kozintsev, Sergei Yutkevich among others.

==Early life==
She was born Aleksandra Aleksandrovna Grigorovich in Białystok, in the Grodno Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Poland) to a wealthy Belarusian family. Her father, Aleksandr Grigorovich, was a wealthy Belarusian businessman. Her mother was Greek.

Young Aleksandra received an excellent private education, studying languages, music, art, and taking private drawing lessons. Soon her parents moved to Kiev, and Asya, as called by her friends, attended St.Olha Gymnasium and Kiev Art School, where she studied with other future stars of avant-garde movement Oleksandr Bohomazov and Alexander Archipenko. Her teachers included prominent Ukrainian painter Mykola Pymonenko. Aleksandra graduated in painting from Kiev Art School in 1906.

== Artistic periods ==

===Kiev===
Her painting studio in the attic at 27 Funduklievskaya Street, now Khmelnytsky Street, was a rallying stage for Kiev&#x27;s intellectual elite. In the attic in her studio, there worked future luminaries of world decorative art Vadym Meller, Anatol Petrytsky and P. Tchelitchew. There she was visited by poets and writers, such as Anna Akhmatova, Ilia Ehrenburg, and Osip Mandelstam, choreographer Bronislava Nijinska and dancer Elsa Kruger, as well as many artists Alexander Bogomazov, Wladimir Baranoff-Rossine, and students, such as Grigori Kozintsev, Sergei Yutkevich, Aleksei Kapler and Abraham Mintchine among many others. In 1908, she participated in an exhibition together with members of the group &quot;Zveno (Link)&quot; organized by David Burliuk, Vladimir Burliuk and others in Kiev.

===Paris===
In Paris, Ekster became personally acquainted with Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, who introduced her to Gertrude Stein.

Under the name Alexandra d&#x27;Exter she exhibited six works at the Salon de la Section d&#x27;Or, Galerie La Boétie, Paris, October 1912, with Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Marcel Duchamp and others.

In 1914, Exter participated in the &quot;Salon des Indépendants&quot; exhibitions in Paris, together with Kazimir Malevich, Alexander Archipenko, Vadym Meller, Sonia Delaunay-Terk and other French and Russian artists. In that same year, she participated with the &quot;Russians&quot; Archipenko, Koulbine and Rozanova in the &quot;International Futurist Exhibition&quot; in Rome. In 1915, she joined the group of avant-garde artists &quot;Supremus&quot;. Her friend introduced her to the poet Apollinaire, who took her to Picasso&#x27;s workshop. According to Moscow Chamber Theatre actress Alice Coonen, &quot;In [Ekster&#x27;s] Parisian household there was a conspicuous peculiar combination of European culture with Ukrainian life. On the walls between Picasso and Braque paintings, there was Ukrainian embroidery; on the floor was a Ukrainian carpet, at the table they served clay pots, colorful majolica plates of dumplings.&quot;

===Russian avant-garde===
Under the avant-garde umbrella, Ekster has been noted to be a suprematist and constructivist painter as well as a major influencer of the Art Deco movement.

While not confined within a particular movement, Ekster was one of the most experimental women of the avant-garde. Ekster absorbed from many sources and cultures in order to develop her own original style. In 1915–1916, she worked in the peasant craft cooperatives in the villages Skoptsi and Verbovka along with Kazimir Malevich, Yevgenia Pribylskaya, Natalia Davidova, Nina Genke, Liubov Popova, Ivan Puni, Olga Rozanova, Nadezhda Udaltsova and others. Ekster later founded a teaching and production workshop (MDI) in Kiev (1918–1920). Alexander Tyshler, Vadym Meller, Anatol Petrytsky, Kliment Red&#x27;ko, Tchelitchew, Shifrin, Nikritin worked there. Also during this period, she was one of the leading stage designers of Alexander Tairov&#x27;s Chamber Theatre.

In 1919, together with other avant-garde artists Kliment Red&#x27;ko and Nina Genke-Meller, she decorated the streets and squares of Kiev and Odessa in abstract style for Revolution Festivities. She worked with Vadym Meller as a costume designer in a ballet studio of the dancer Bronislava Nijinska. One of her students in her studio in Odessa was Isaac Frenkel Frenel, who would later become an École de Paris painter.

In 1921, she became a director of the elementary course &quot;Color&quot; at the Higher Artistic-Technical Workshop (VKhUTEMAS) in Moscow, a position she held until 1924. Her work was displayed alongside that of other Constructivist artists at the &quot;5x5=25&quot; exhibition held in Moscow in 1921.

In the spring of 1924, Alexandra Exter travelled to Venice to take part in organising the 14th Venice Biennale. Most of Ekster&#x27;s works were not exposed but were part of the exhibition catalogue. Yet, she also created a special painting inspired by Venice at the entrance hall on the second floor of the Soviet Pavilion. Several pieces of research on this painting are now in international and private collections.

=== Revolutionising costume design ===
In line with her eclectic avant-garde-like style, Ekster&#x27;s early paintings strongly influenced her costume design as well as her book illustrations, which are scarcely noted. All of Ekster&#x27;s works, no matter the medium, stick to her distinct style. Her works are vibrant, playful, dramatic, and theatrical in composition, subject matter, and color. Ekster constantly stayed true to her composition aesthetic across all mediums. Furthermore, each medium only enhanced and influenced her work in other mediums.
With her assimilation of many different genres, her essential futurist and cubist ideas were always in tandem with her attention to colour and rhythm. Ekster uses many elements of geometric compositions, which reinforce the core intentions of dynamism, vibrant contrasts, and free brushwork. Ekster stretched the dynamic intentions of her work across all mediums. Ekster&#x27;s theatrical works such as sculptures, costume design, set design, and decorations for the revolutionary festivals, strongly reflect her work with geometric elements and vibrant intentions.
Through her costume work, she experimented with the transparency, movement, and vibrancy of fabrics. Ekster&#x27;s movement of her brushstroke in her artwork is reflected in the movement of the fabric in her costumes. Ekster&#x27;s theatrical sets used multi-coloured dimensions and experimented with spatial structures. She continued with these experimental tendencies in her later puppet designs. With her experimentation across many mediums, Ekster started to take the concept of her costume design and integrate it into everyday life. In 1921, Ekster&#x27;s work in fashion design began. Though her mass production designs were wearable, most of her fashion design was highly decorative and innovative, usually falling under the category of haute couture.

In 1923, she continued her work in many media in addition to collaborating with Vera Mukhina and Boris Gladkov in Moscow on the decor of the All Russian Exhibition pavilions.

=== Ukrainian folk influences ===
Thanks to the connections of her husband, Mykola Ekster, Aleksandra met Natalia Davydova, who had an estate with craftsmanship in Verbivtsi near Cherkasy. It was there that the artist, who is now considered a representative of European Cubism, Futurism, Ukrainian avant-garde, one of the founders of the Art Deco style, discovered Ukrainian folk art, that was one of the influences in her works. According to Georgy Kovalenko, a researcher of Aleksandra Ekster&#x27;s work, the time in Verbivka was the determining factor in the artist&#x27;s painting, her colourful poem and became a source of imagery: &quot;She conducted real scientific expeditions in search of ancient peasant embroideries, liturgical sewing, and weaving items,&quot; Kovalenko wrote in his monograph.

Ekster and Davydova with other researchers searched for folk motifs, reinterpreted them, modernized them and, together with Kazimir Malevich, Ivan Puni, Ksenia Boguslavska, drew supremacist designs for embroideries on bags, pillows, carpets, and belts. Later, they created the Kiev handicraft society and also presented embroideries from Verbivtsi at exhibitions in Kiev and European countries. In 1917, more than 400 works were exhibited in Moscow, from where they never returned.

== Personal life ==
In 1908, Aleksandra Grigorovich married a successful Kiev lawyer, Nikolai Evgenyevich Ekster. The Eksters belonged to the cultural and intellectual elite of Kiev. She spent several months with her husband in Paris, and there she attended Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Montparnasse. From 1908 to 1924, she intermittently lived in Kiev, St. Petersburg, Odessa, Paris, Rome and Moscow.

In 1924, Aleksandra Ekster and her husband emigrated to France and settled in Paris, where she initially became a professor at the &quot;Academie Moderne&quot;. From 1926 to 1930, Ekster was a professor at Fernand Léger&#x27;s Académie d&#x27;Art Contemporain. In 1933, she began creating beautiful and original illuminated manuscripts (gouache on paper), perhaps the most important works of the last phase of her life. The &quot;Callimaque&quot; manuscript (c. 1939, the text being a French translation of a hymn by Hellenistic poet Callimachus) is widely regarded as her masterpiece. From 1933 her work was limited as her health was declining with heart disease. In 1936, she participated in the exhibition &quot;Cubism and Abstract Art&quot; in New York and went on to have solo exhibitions in Prague and in Paris. She was a book illustrator for the publishing company &quot;Flammarion&quot;. She drew illustrations for several poetry books and for three of Marie Colmont&#x27;s children&#x27;s books, which were published from 1939 to 1940.

During World War II, she and her husband lived in harsh poverty. After her husband died in 1945, her last work was a sculpture of an angel, which would be placed above what would be their joint grave site. She died in Paris in 1949 and is buried at the cemetery of Fontenay-aux-Roses.

During the past few decades, her reputation has increased dramatically, as have the prices of her works. As a consequence, several fakes have appeared on the market in recent years.

<doc id="749756" wikidata="Q4419959" url="?curid=749756" title="Camp Schwab">
<text>Camp Schwab is a United States Marine Corps camp located in northeastern Okinawa Prefecture, Japan, that is currently home to the 4th Marine Regiment and other elements of the 28,000 American servicemen based on the island. The Camp was dedicated in 1959 in honor of Medal of Honor recipient Albert E. Schwab who was killed in action during the Battle of Okinawa.

Camp Schwab is primarily located in the city of Nago (99%); a small part of the base is located in the village of Ginoza (1%).

The unit conducts live-fire training and coordination with other units.

== Base overview ==
* Location: Nago (Toyohara, Henoko, Kushi, Kyoda, Sukuta, Yofuke), Ginoza Village (Matsuda)
* Area: 20,626 thousand m2
* Area ratio by municipality: Nago City 99% (about 20.43 km 2 ), Ginoza Village 1% (about 0.2 km 2 )
* Management Unit: U.S. Marine Corps Base Command in Okinawa
* Number of landowners: 752
* Annual rent: 2,639 million yen (FY2012 results)
* Number of stationed Marine employees: 242

Adjacent to the north side of Camp Schwab is the Henoko Ordnance Storage.

===Units and mission===
III Marine Expeditionary Force, 3rd Marine Division (4th Marine Regiment, Combat Assault Battalion and 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion), etc. (Army, Navy, Air Force use range etc.)

Purpose of use: Dormitory, various entertainment facilities, management office and training ground

==Geography==
It is divided into a Schwab training area located in the inland area on the west side of Route 329 (* at the same time, National Route 331 also overlaps) and a camp area on the east coast.

The Henoko Ordnance Storage is adjacent to the north side. The Schwab training area forms the north side of a large training ground called the Central Training Area. The south side is adjacent to the Camp Hansen training area.

There is also a Marine training ground and training area on the coast for amphibious assault exercises on LSTs (tank landing ships) and amphibious vehicles. The foot of Mt. Kushidake is used as a landing area for live ammunition training and as an abandoned ammunition disposal site.

==Relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma==

There have been various plans to relocate Marine Corps Air Station Futenma—first off the island and most recently to Camp Schwab—however, the future of any relocation is uncertain with the election of base-opponent Onaga as Okinawa governor. Onaga won against the incumbent Nakaima who had earlier approved landfill work to move the base to Camp Schwab in Henoko. Onaga has promised to veto the landfill work needed for the new base to be built and insisted Futenma should be moved outside of Okinawa.

==Incidents==

Reports indicate that Agent Orange was stored and used at Camp Schwab and other US bases on Okinawa in the 1960s. The US government denies that the toxin was present at the base, and the Japanese government has declined to investigate.

On 24 March 2009, a Marine was killed and two others injured in an explosion near the base. The Marine Corps announced that the Marines were part of an explosive ordnance disposal team preparing unexploded ordnance for disposal when the explosion occurred.

<doc id="749767" wikidata="Q1012082" url="?curid=749767" title="Chorlton-on-Medlock">
<text>Chorlton-on-Medlock is an inner city area of Manchester, in the county of Greater Manchester, England.

Historically in Lancashire, Chorlton-on-Medlock is bordered to the north by the River Medlock, which runs immediately south of Manchester city centre. Its other borders roughly correspond to Stockport Road, Hathersage Road, Moss Lane East and Boundary Lane. Neighbouring districts are Hulme to the west, Ardwick to the east and Victoria Park, Rusholme and Moss Side to the south. A large portion of the district along Oxford Road is occupied by the campuses of the University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University, and the Royal Northern College of Music. To the south of the university&#x27;s Oxford Road campus a considerable area is occupied by a group of contiguous hospitals including Manchester Royal Infirmary, to the west of which is Whitworth Park.

==History==
In medieval times, the district was known as Chorlton Row and was a township of the ancient parish of Manchester in the Salford hundred of Lancashire. Towards the end of the 18th century, it developed as a residential suburb of Manchester and in the extreme north of the township a number of cotton mills were established. In 1820 the parish church of All Saints was built. Development began in 1793–94 and most of the important streets were given impressive names, Oxford Street, Cambridge Street and Grosvenor Street.

Over the following 30 years residential development spread southwards as far as Tuer Street: and by the mid-1840s to High Street. Few dwellings of that period remain today apart from Waterloo Place, 323, 325, 327 &amp; 333 Oxford Road, and Grove House (316–324).

On the creation of the municipal borough of Manchester in 1838 the township was absorbed into the borough. At this time the southern area was still partly rural with some larger dwellings of wealthy people (e.g., John Owens in Nelson Street). After the Poor Law Reform of 1834 the district became part of the Chorlton Poor Law Union and the offices of the Board of Guardians were built in Cavendish Street (these are now the Ormond Building of the Metropolitan University). The arrival of Owens College in 1873 was the beginning of a different kind of development leading to the academic campus of today.

In 1866 Chorlton upon Medlock became a separate civil parish, on 26 March 1896 the parish was abolished to form South Manchester. In 1891 the parish had a population of 59,620.

Though most of the township was originally middle class in character by the early 20th century it was very much a working class district. The housing conditions were described in 1931 by the Manchester and District Social Survey Society.

Between the arrival of Owens College in 1873 and the 1940s the college and the university it became slowly expanded into the adjacent residential areas which had by then a mostly working class population including many of Irish descent. However, during the early years of the 21st century the University of Manchester undertook an extensive Capital Development Project which was followed by a partnership with the city council and other bodies called Corridor Manchester. Together these have changed the face of Oxford Road to a remarkable extent.&#x27;

==Geography==
The M13 postcode district includes both Ardwick and Chorlton on Medlock, although the area east of Boundary Lane and west of the Dental Hospital has a Hulme (M15) postcode, and Greenheys is now in Moss Side ward rather than Chorlton on Medlock. The River Medlock is the boundary with Manchester city centre, which includes the Sackville Street campus of the University of Manchester (or &quot;North Campus&quot; rather than &quot;South Campus&quot;). A large area of Chorlton on Medlock south-west of this is occupied by the Manchester Metropolitan University.

==Transport==

Chorlton on Medlock is crossed by the Mancunian Way (opened 1967), running west to east through its northern part. The main routes through the suburb to south Manchester are (west to east) Cambridge Street (leading to Higher Cambridge Street, Lloyd Street North and Upper Lloyd Street), Oxford Road (leading to Wilmslow Road; the busiest route, both for private and public transport), and Upper Brook Street (dual carriageway continuing from Princess Street and leading to Anson Road).

==Landmarks==
The façade of the former Chorlton-on-Medlock Town Hall can be seen at its original location on Cavendish Street. The building, with its Doric portico, dates from 1830–31 and was designed by Richard Lane. In Nelson Street the former home of the Pankhurst family is now the Pankhurst Centre. The Ormond Building of the Manchester Metropolitan University was originally the home of the Chorlton Union Board of Guardians (responsible under the 1834 Poor Law for most of what is now south Manchester). Next to the town hall building is the original building of the Manchester College of Art (1880–81: architect George Tunstal Redmayne) in a Gothic revival style.

Further down Oxford Road are the University of Manchester (frontage built 1888–1902), the former Manchester Royal Eye Hospital (1886), Manchester Royal Infirmary (1908) and the Whitworth Art Gallery (1898–1908).

==Religion==

The parish church of All Saints (1820) and the earlier Church of St Luke (founded before 1804 but a new church was built by John Lowe in 1865; part of Old Chorlton Hall was used as the rectory) (to the east) have been demolished as have several other Anglican churches in this area. Anglican churches which are disused include St Stephen&#x27;s (E. H. Shellard, 1853), St Paul&#x27;s (Clegg &amp; Knowles, 1862), and St Ambrose (H. C. Charlewood, 1884): these have all been demolished apart from St Ambrose which was used by the University of Manchester as an Islamic prayer room but the prayer room is now elsewhere. In Greenheys there was formerly an Anglican church of St Clement on Denmark Road (architect Henry R. Price, 1881, decorated by John Lowe, 1886).
The oldest Roman Catholic church in Chorlton-on-Medlock was the Church of the Holy Name on Oxford Road (built between 1869 and 1871), a fine example of the work of the architect Joseph Aloysius Hansom. St Augustine&#x27;s, Granby Row (demolished in 1908 to allow expansion at the Municipal College of Technology) was replaced by a second St Augustine&#x27;s in York Street, Chorlton-on-Medlock (ruined by German bombing in 1940 during World War II): its successor is at Lower Ormond Street on the Manchester Metropolitan University campus in a building which serves also as a chaplaincy to the University. This church was built in dark brick to the designs of Desmond Williams &amp; Associates in 1967–68. It replaced an earlier church of the Holy Family which was at first a chapel-of-ease to St Augustine&#x27;s, then an independent parish, but a chapel-of-ease again from 1908 to 1940 when it became the parish church of St Augustine&#x27;s parish.

The Armenian church in Upper Brook Street was the first purpose-built Armenian church in Western Europe. It is dedicated to the Holy Trinity and opened at Easter 1870. The architects were Royle &amp; Bennett, 1869–70, and they chose an eclectic neo-Gothic style. At the east end is a rounded apse and the interior is simple though the altar is elaborate.

There were also several Nonconformist chapels (most of them now demolished) such as the Cavendish Street Congregational Church, Cavendish Street (architect Edward Walters, 1847–48), the Union Chapel on Oxford Road, Plymouth Grove Wesleyan Methodist Church (built 1879) on the corner of Hyde Grove and Plymouth Grove and a Presbyterian chapel at All Saints. The chapel in Cavendish Street was a particularly fine neo-Gothic building but was demolished in the early 1970s to allow expansion by Manchester Polytechnic. It replaced an earlier chapel in Mosley Street. The Welsh Baptist Chapel, on Upper Brook Street, was designed in the early 19th century by Sir Charles Barry, who designed the Palace of Westminster shortly afterwards, and in Greenheys there was a German Protestant Church in Wright Street (ca. 1871).

The Salvation Army&#x27;s Manchester Central corps is based at Manchester Temple, Grosvenor Street. It was founded in 1879 and a modern Salvation Army building stands on the site of the original one, and is called Manchester Central.

There are two mosques in Chorlton-on-Medlock, the Salimiya Mosque and the Islamic Academy of Manchester, Upper Brook Street (in the building of the former Welsh Baptist Chapel). The former church of St Ambrose was used by the University of Manchester as an Islamic prayer room for several years. There are prayer rooms at the University of Manchester and at the Manchester Metropolitan University in Oxford Road.

<text>Manchester Art Gallery, formerly Manchester City Art Gallery, is a publicly owned art museum on Mosley Street in Manchester city centre, England. The main gallery premises were built for a learned society in 1823 and today its collection occupies three connected buildings, two of which were designed by Sir Charles Barry. Both of Barry&#x27;s buildings are listed. The building that links them was designed by Hopkins Architects following an architectural design competition managed by RIBA Competitions. It opened in 2002 following a major renovation and expansion project undertaken by the art gallery.

Manchester Art Gallery is free to enter and open six days a week, closed Mondays. It houses many works of local and international significance and has a collection of more than 25,000 objects. More than half a million people visited the museum in the period of a year, according to figures released in April 2014.

==History==

===Royal Manchester Institution===

The Royal Manchester Institution was a scholarly society formed in 1823. It was housed in what is now the art gallery&#x27;s main gallery building on Mosley Street. The first object acquired for its collection, James Northcote&#x27;s &quot;A Moor&quot; (a portrait of the celebrated black actor Ira Aldridge), was bought in 1827.

The Royal Manchester Institution opened its galleries to the public 10 years after its formation and subsequently held regular art exhibitions, collected works of fine art and promoted the arts from the 1820s until 1882 when its premises and collections were transferred under Act of Parliament to Manchester Corporation, becoming Manchester Art Gallery. The institution was handed over on condition that £2,000 per annum would be spent on art for the next 20 years. The Art Gallery Committee bought enthusiastically and by the end of the 19th century had accrued an impressive collection of fine art, added to by gifts and bequests from wealthy Mancunian industrialists.

On 3 April 1913, three women (Lillian Williamson, Evelyn Manesta, and Annie Briggs) staged a protest in favour of women&#x27;s suffrage in the United Kingdom. They broke the glass of 13 paintings including two by John Everett Millais and two by George Frederick Watts. Four of the paintings were damaged by the broken glass. Williamson was sent to jail for three months and Manesta for one.

==Governance==
The gallery is operated by Manchester City Galleries, a department of Manchester City Council which is also responsible for Platt Hall, Fallowfield. Alistair Hudson is the director of the galleries and also director of the University of Manchester&#x27;s Whitworth Art Gallery. He became joint director in a collaboration between the council and the university in 2018.

The gallery&#x27;s budget is controlled by the council but it also funded by the Manchester Art Gallery Trust, a charity (Registered Charity Number 1048581) that supports its work. The trust raises nearly half the funding required from companies, individuals and grant making trusts and foundations. The gallery is currently open daily and on the first Wednesday of every month opens until 9pm.

==Architecture==

Manchester Art Gallery is housed in three connected buildings. The City Art Gallery building, which faces onto Mosley Street, was designed and constructed between 1824 and 1835. It originally housed the Royal Manchester Institution. Designed by architect Sir Charles Barry in the Greek Ionic style, the building is now Grade I listed. The two-storey gallery is built in rusticated ashlar to a rectangular plan on a raised plinth. The roof is hidden by a continuous dentilled cornice and plain parapet. Its 11-bay façade has two three-bay side ranges and a central five-bay pedimented projecting portico with six Ionic columns. Set back behind the parapet is an attic with small windows that forms a lantern above the entrance hall.

Manchester Athenaeum, also designed by Barry, was built in 1837 and was bought by the Manchester Corporation in 1938 to provide additional space. It is Grade II* listed and designed in the Italian Palazzo style. The Athenaeum fronts onto Princess Street.

In November 1994, an architectural design competition managed by RIBA Competitions was launched to refurbish the existing historic gallery and the Athenaeum and link them with a new building on the car park site. The competition attracted 132 architects, six of whom were selected to proceed to the final stage. Michael Hopkins and Partners were announced as winners in January 1995. The gallery closed in 1998 and reopened in 2002 following the £35 million refurbishment and extension. The new extension was criticised as &quot;the splendid and really beautiful interiors of the original building .. have been gratuitously spoiled&quot;, and was the 2002 winner of the Sir Hugh Casson Award for the worst new building of the year.

==Collections==

The gallery has a fine art collection consisting of more than 2,000 oil paintings, 3,000 watercolours and drawings, 250 sculptures, 90 miniatures and around 1,000 prints. It owns more than 13,000 decorative art objects including ceramics, glass, enamels, furniture, metalwork, arms and armour, wallpapers, doll houses and related items. The oldest object is an Egyptian canopic jar from circa 1100 BC.

Thomas Coglan Horsfall&#x27;s eclectic collection from the Manchester Art Museum in Ancoats Hall was absorbed into the gallery when the museum closed in 1953.

Manchester Art Gallery is strongest in its collection of Victorian art, especially that of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and Victorian decorative arts.

The gallery houses several works by the French impressionist, Pierre Adolphe Valette, who painted and taught in Manchester in the early years of the 20th century; some of his scenes of foggy Manchester streets and canals are displayed. A Cézanne hangs in the same room, showing the similarity in treatment and subject between his misty French river bridge and Valette&#x27;s bridge in a pre-Clean Air Act Mancunian fog. L. S. Lowry was one of Valette&#x27;s students and the influence on Lowry of impressionism can be seen at the gallery, where paintings by the two artists hang together. While most locally held Lowry works are in the collection of The Lowry gallery, away in Salford, the Manchester Art Gallery has Lowry&#x27;s 1954 painting &quot;Piccadilly Gardens&quot; on display.

The museum houses &quot;The Picnic&quot; (1908), a work by the British Impressionist painter Wynford Dewhurst, who was born in Manchester.
Annie Swynnerton who was born in Hulme is represented in the collection by 16 paintings and her contemporary at the Manchester School of Art, Susan Dacre by 17 paintings.

As well as paintings, the museum holds collections of glass, silverware and furniture, including four pieces by the Victorian architect and designer William Burges.

In January 2018, the gallery took down John William Waterhouse&#x27;s &quot;Hylas and the Nymphs&quot; (1896), leaving an empty space to encourage debate as to how women&#x27;s bodies should be displayed. Post-it notes were provided for visitors to air their views. The gallery&#x27;s actions prompted a strong backlash with accusations of censorship, puritanism and political correctness. The museum was &quot;completely taken by surprise by the ferocity of the response&quot; and the painting was rehung after a week&#x27;s absence. The removal came two months after an unsuccessful campaign to have the Metropolitan Museum of Art remove a painting by Balthus of an adolescent girl.

<text>A deformity, dysmorphism, or dysmorphic feature is a major abnormality of an organism that makes a part of the body appear or function differently than how it is supposed to.

==Causes==
Deformity can be caused by a variety of factors:
*Arthritis and other rheumatoid disorders
*Chronic application of external forces, e.g. artificial cranial deformation
*Chronic paresis, paralysis or muscle imbalance, especially in children, e.g. due to poliomyelitis or cerebral palsy
*Complications at birth
*Damage to the fetus or uterus
*Fractured bones left to heal without being properly set (malunion)
*Genetic mutation
*Growth or hormone disorders
*Skin disorders
*Reconstructive surgery following a severe injury, e.g. burn injury

Deformity can occur in all organisms:

* Frogs can be mutated due to &quot;Ribeiroia&quot; (Trematoda) infection.
* Plants can undergo irreversible cell deformation
* Insects, such as honeybees, can be affected by deformed wing virus
* Fish can be found with scoliosis due to environmental factors

==Mortality==
In many cases where a major deformity is present at birth, it is the result of an underlying condition severe enough that the baby does not survive very long. The mortality of severely deformed births may be due to a range of complications including missing or non-functioning vital organs, structural defects that prevent necessary function, high susceptibility to injuries, abnormal facial appearance, or infections that eventually lead to death.

In some cases, such as that of twins, one fetus is brought to term healthy, while the other faces major, even life-threatening defects. An example of this is seen in cattle, referred to as amorphous globosus.

==In mythology==
There are many instances of mythological characters showing signs of a deformity.

* Descriptions of mermaids may be related to the symptoms of sirenomelia.
* The Irish mythology includes the Fomorians, who are almost without exception described as being deformed, possessing only one of what most have two (eyes, arms, legs, etc.) or having larger than normal limbs.
* Hephaestus, of Greek Mythology, was born with a club foot.

<text>Salò (; ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the Province of Brescia in the region of Lombardy (northern Italy) on the banks of Lake Garda, on which it has the longest promenade. The city was the seat of government of the Italian Social Republic from 1943 to 1945, a state often referred to as the &quot;Salò Republic&quot; (&quot;Repubblica di Salò&quot; in Italian).

==History==

===Roman period===
Although legend has it that Salò has Etruscan origins, recorded history starts with the founding by ancient Romans of the colony of &quot;Pagus Salodium&quot;. There are numerous ruins of the Roman settlement, as shown by the &quot;Lugone necropolis&quot; (in via Sant&#x27;Jago) and the findings (vase-flasks and funeral steles) in the Civic Archaeological Museum located at the &quot;Loggia della Magnifica Patria&quot;.

===Middle Ages===
During the high Middle Ages, the city shared the same history as that of Lombardy.

The origins of the municipality of Salò are barely known: its autonomy from Brescia can be dated towards the end of the 13th century or the beginning of the next one, and the most ancient statues conserved by the city authorities are dated 1397.

Prior to 1334, the town was part of a sort of federation of town councils of the territory along the western lakeshore of Lake Garda (from Limone down to Desenzano) and the Valsabbia areas, called &quot;Riperia Lacus Gardae Brixiensis&quot; with the chef-lieu of Maderno.

The federation did not want to form an alliance with Brescia nor with Verona deciding instead to request the help of Venice. Due to the distance of Venice, this strategy did not guarantee the independence of the area and, after a short protectorate under the rule of Venice (from 1336 to 1349), Salò became a stronghold of the Milanese Visconti family. In 1377 Beatrice della Scala, the wife of Bernabò Visconti, wanted Salò to be the capital of the area, reducing the influence of Maderno: the city was provided with solid walls and the castle was built.

===The &quot;Magnifica Patria&quot;===
On 13 May 1426, after a long period of war, the towns of western bank of the lake spontaneously joined the Venetian Republic, where they remained for the following three centuries: in the main square a column with the Lion of St Mark, symbol of Venice, can be found still today.

Over the years, Venice gave large autonomy to this province of its &quot;Stato da Tera&quot;, that remained a &quot;de facto&quot; independent area and was given both the titles of &quot;Magnifica Patria&quot; (Magnificent Homeland) and &quot;Figlia primogenita della Serenissima&quot; (firstborn daughter of the Serenissima).

The general council of the &quot;Patria&quot; and its other institutions remained all centred in Salò (which gained importance and influence), although a governor was sent by the capital, who was given the titles of &quot;Provveditore&quot; (Superintendent) and &quot;Capitano della Riviera&quot; (Captain of the Riviera) and the power to act as penal judge for the whole Riviera (whilst civil justice was entrusted to a Brescian podestà who also resided in Salò). Besides farming and trade, the linen industry developed in this period.

===Napoleonic era and Risorgimento===

In 1796 Napoleons troops fought with Austrian troops in Northern Italy during the First Italian campaign. The end of the Venetian republic (Treaty of Campo Formio) ended Salò&#x27;s position as the capital of the western riviera: on 1 January 1797, the provisional Brescian government instituted the Canton of Benaco with the capital of Benaco, &quot;aforesaid Salò&quot;: the town joined the Cisalpine Republic and then the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy (1805–1814).

After the Napoleonic Era, Salò became part of the Austrian Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia from 1815 to 1859.

In 1848 Salò joined the Milan revolution against the Habsburg rule and during the Second Italian War of Independence, there were many volunteers that fought with Garibaldi serving in the Piedmontese Army. On 18 June 1859, Garibaldi entered Salò and was welcomed by a happy crowd. Salò received the honorary title of &quot;Città&quot; (City) with a royal decree on 15 December 1860.
In 1866 the town was the headquarters of the Italian navy during the war with Austria. After the battle of Custoza the Austrians temporarily retook control of the town, but despite their victory and a naval defeat of the Italians at Lissa, the Austrians surrendered to the Prussians a month later and were forced to cede Venetia after the Treaty of Vienna.

===Italian Social Republic===
From 1943 to 1945 Salò was the &quot;de facto&quot; capital (seat of government) of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Nazi-backed puppet state, the Italian Social Republic, also known as the Republic of Salò: Villa Castagna was the seat of the police headquarters, Villa Amedei was the head office of the Ministry of Popular Culture, Villa Simonini (nowadays Hotel Laurin) was the seat of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Stefani Agency, which distributed official press releases, was located in Via Brunati.

==Main sights==

*The &quot;Duomo di Santa Maria Annunziata&quot; (cathedral of the Annunciation to Saint Mary), rebuilt in late Gothic style in the 15th century. It has a noteworthy Renaissance portal by Gasparo Cairano and Antonio Mangiacavalli, paintings by Zenone Veronese (16th century), a Polyptych of Paolo Veneziano&#x27;s school and a &quot;Madonna and Saints&quot; by Romanino.
*The &quot;Palazzo della Magnifica Patria&quot; (&quot;Palace of the Magnificent Fatherland&quot;, 16th century). The palace is home to the Historical Museum of the Azure Ribbon, an exhibition of documents on Renaissance history, on Italy&#x27;s colonial wars, the Spanish Civil War and the Resistance against Fascism.
*The Communal Palace is the seat of the Civic Archaeological Museum, with findings from the ancient &quot;Salodium&quot;.
*The local museum &quot;MUSA&quot;, opened in 2015.

==Seismicity==


The area around the lake is a seismic zone. In 1877 a meteorological observatory was established under the supervision Prof. Pio Bettoni, to whom it was later dedicated. In 1889, a geophysical observatory (seismic station) was added, which became an important scientific research centre after the 1901 earthquake (5.5 Mw, intensity VII–VIII, no fatalities, buildings damaged). Another earthquake occurred in 2004 (5.1 Mw, intensity VII–VIII, nine injuries, many buildings damaged).

<text>The Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (or SST) is a refracting solar telescope at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, La Palma in the Canary Islands. It is run by the Institute for Solar Physics of Stockholm University. The primary element is a single fused silica lens, making it the largest optical refracting telescope in use in the world. The Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, with a lens diameter of 43 inches, is technically larger than Yerkes Observatory, only 39 inches are clear for the aperture. The SST is most often used as a Schupmann telescope, thereby correcting the chromatic aberrations of the singlet primary.

The SST is a vacuum telescope, meaning that it is evacuated internally to avoid disruption of the image from air inside. This is a particular problem with solar telescopes because of the heating from the large amounts of light collected being passed on to any air causing image degradation.

As of 2005 the SST has produced the highest resolution images on the Sun of any telescope. This is largely thanks to its adaptive optics system, which was upgraded to an 85-electrode monomorph deformable mirror from CILAS in 2013.

There are two modes of operation, selected by switching the beam from one optical table to another. One mode is a spectrograph mode, using the TRIPPEL spectrograph. The other mode is an imaging mode, where the beam is split up in a red and a blue part by a 500-nm dichroic beamsplitter. Both beams have dual Fabry-Pérot-based tunable filters, CRISP in the red and CHROMIS in the blue. The image data are usually compensated for residual wavefront aberrations by use of the MOMFBD image reconstruction method.

The SST superseded the SVST – the Swedish Vacuum Solar Telescope – which was 47,5 cm in diameter.

==Instruments==

===CHROMIS===

The &quot;CHROMospheric Imaging Spectrometer&quot; (CHROMIS) was installed in 2016. It is similar to CRISP (but so far without polarimetry) and designed for use at wavelengths in the range 380–500 nm. In particular, CHROMIS is optimized for use in the Ca II H and K lines, which are formed in the upper chromosphere. The total system uses three 1920×1200-pixel Grasshopper 3 CMOS cameras from Point Grey (now FLIR). One camera is used for direct narrow-band observations and two, in a phase-diversity configuration, are collecting simultaneous wide-band image data.

===CRISP===

The &quot;CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter&quot; (CRISP) was installed in 2008. It operates from 510 to 860 nm and is able to measure polarization by using liquid crystal modulation combined with a polarizing beam splitter. The total system uses three 1k × 1k Sarnoff CCDs, two are used for direct narrow-band observations and the third is collecting simultaneous wide-band images.

===TRIPPEL===

The &quot;TRI-Port Polarimetric Echelle-Littrow&quot; (TRIPPEL) is a Littrow spectrograph using a 79 grooves/mm echelle grating with a blaze angle of 63.43 degrees. TRIPPEL&#x27;s wavelength range is about 380–1100 nm, and it has a moderate resolution for a solar telescope, with R being approximately 200,000. This corresponds to about 1.3 km/s on the solar surface.

TRIPPEL has a number of key useful features. It allows simultaneous observations at 3 different wavelengths, can in principle exploit the full spatial resolution of the SST, and has good polarimetric properties.

<text>esea contemporary, formerly the Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art, is a contemporary art gallery based in Manchester, England. It is located on Thomas Street in Manchester&#x27;s Northern Quarter in the renovated part of the Smithfield Market Hall.

==History==
===Origins of the Chinese Arts Centre (1986-1989)===

The origins of the CFCCA can be found in the Black Arts Movement of the late 1980s which highlighted the artistic plight of people of African, Caribbean, or South Asian origin yet often excluded artists of Chinese origin. In the mid-1980s, Amy Lai, an artist and radio producer based in Manchester, thought there was a general lack of Chinese cultural activities compared to events arranged by the Asian and Caribbean communities. Using her links at the Eastern Horizon radio programme, Lai organised Chinese View ‘86, a two-week festival celebrating Chinese culture. The aim of the festival was to &quot;&quot;engage the local ethnically Chinese community with arts and education programmes that worked to explore Chinese cultural identity&quot;.&quot;

In June 1987, Lai, with Peter Chui, Jenny Clegg, and David Wong, founded the Chinese View Arts Association (CVAA), a charitable organisation with the mission to &quot;advance the education of the public in all forms of Chinese culture&quot;. Working under the remit of the CVAA, Amy Lai organised cultural activities across Manchester and north west England working with a group of local artists of Chinese heritage. The events aimed to develop a stronger sense of cultural identity within the local Chinese community by revitalising their interest in traditional arts and crafts, while also increasing awareness of the Chinese way of life in the general population. Lai&#x27;s philosophy at the time was that the activities had to be &quot;open door, inclusive, and involved in the mainstream community&quot;.

The members of the CVAA also felt that too few locally-born people of Chinese heritage were growing up with an understanding of, or skills in, traditional Chinese arts and crafts. To address this concern, they opened a Chinese cultural centre. The centre would provide cultural activities, aimed at both the local community and the wider population, to promote an appreciation of &quot;&quot;Chinese life, culture, philosophy, and values&quot;,&quot; and act as a regional focus for information and advice about Chinese culture.

===Chinese Arts Centre as a grass roots community centre (1989-1992)===
The CVAA opened the Chinese Arts Centre on 21 October 1989, on the first floor of Frazer House, Charlotte Street, in Manchester&#x27;s Chinatown. The centre was officially opened on 17 January 1990, by Diana, Princess of Wales.

The centre was originally built upon an ethos of fostering community cohesion between the local Chinese community in Manchester and other communities in the north west of England. The centre&#x27;s educational programme was part of its commitment to promote Chinese culture to the local community and the north-west. The centre facilitated artist-led educational workshops and had a long relationship with local practitioners, such as Mary Tang and Cathy Wu.

The centre also held exhibitions and events which promoted Chinese arts and culture. Up until then, most exhibitions of &quot;Chinese Arts&quot; in Manchester had been curated and displayed by British collectors at venues such as the Manchester Art Gallery. Many of the centre&#x27;s early exhibitions focused on local culturally-significant works as well as more national and international practitioners. In 1992, the centre held its first large scale contemporary art exhibition, &quot;Beyond the Chinese Takeaway&quot;, which reflected on the experience of second and third generation British Chinese artists. The leaflet for the exhibition stated that it was &quot;the first exhibition of its kind researching the innovative works of contemporary artists of Chinese origin living in Britain&quot; and worked to &quot;challenge the stereotypes&quot; of the Chinese community.

===Reviewing the focus of the centre (1993-1996)===
A review of the organisation in 1993 by external consultants found that the centre had &quot;&quot;consistently fallen well short of fulfilling its purpose&quot; and the general perception was that the organisation was on &quot;borrowed time&quot;&quot;. The centre was relaunched in October 1993 with a renewed mission to promote a wide range of traditional and contemporary art forms and would use its artistic and education programmes to progress how Chinese culture was perceived in the UK. The organisation also began to reposition itself as a development agency for emerging artists and art makers of Chinese heritage. As a part of the relaunch, the centre arranged a city-wide series of events to mark Chinese New Year in 1994, featuring activities at the centre, the greenroom, Cornerhouse, and the Dancehouse theatre. The centre also programmed the &quot;Journey&#x27;s West&quot; exhibition, which was initiated by the Lambeth Chinese Community Association.

In 1994, the CVAA introduced an arts worker training scheme and activities targeted at the local community to address its staffing problems and to strengthen its links with the local community. The new ways of working were tested between September 1995-March 1996 whilst the centre was one of the hosts of the British Art Show 4 and during their lunar new year activities. During the British Art Show, the Centre displayed works by British artist Mat Collishaw. The hosts of the show had no say in the artists selected for their venues, but the acting director of the centre at the time, Kwong Lee, later stated that the increased exposure and the chance for the centre to have a temporary place at the centre of the art world justified programming an exhibition which did not feature the work of an artist of Chinese heritage.

Around this time, the CVAA discovered that their 1996-1997 grant from their core funder, the North West Arts Board (NWAB), was to be almost halved. It was agreed that the centre could no longer operate in its current form, and the Board of the CVAA began to look for a new venue and strategic lead for the centre. In June 1996, Sarah Champion became the centre&#x27;s Arts Development Coordinator. Champion later stated that she was given 6 months to make the centre a success or close it down. The centre&#x27;s new mission and objectives were finalised and five key development areas were established: education; artists development; the Chinese community; arts promotion; and advocacy and lobbying.

===A national agency for Chinese arts (1997-2003)===
Champion became the director of the centre when it moved to new premises on Edge Street in Manchester&#x27;s Northern Quarter in 1997. This was period of great change in the centre&#x27;s functions and focus. More opportunities became available due to both the policies of the new Labour government, who placed greater emphasis on the importance of culture, and the increased interest in Chinese culture due to the upcoming Handover of Hong Kong. By moving away from Chinatown, the centre also became less focused on the local Chinese community; instead focusing more on contemporary art. It was also Champion&#x27;s aim that the centre would work towards becoming &quot;the&quot; UK agency for Chinese arts and culture. The centre would operate as an agency from 1999 and the charity was renamed the Chinese Arts Centre Ltd in September 2000.

UK-based artists remained the main focus of the centre&#x27;s exhibition programme during this period. Initially, the centre&#x27;s programme largely featured solo shows of existing works by artists such as Adam Hongshan Wei and Anthony Key, or touring exhibitions, such as Nora Fok&#x27;s &quot;Galaxies&quot;. When the venue was refurbished after a fire in 1998, the centre began to commission new site specific works by UK-based artists of east Asian heritage to use the new space to its best advantage. Between 2000 and 2003, the &quot;New Commissions&quot; scheme produced 8 exhibitions by emerging artists such as Suki Chan, Lisa Cheung, Gayle Chong Kwan, and Jiang Jiehong.

As part of its agency work, the centre extended the scope of its educational workshops to a national audience and acted as a focal point for other businesses and art organisations who wanted to know more about Chinese culture. The centre began to contribute to debates regarding Chinese arts by arranging conferences such as &quot;A New Vocabulary for Chinese Arts?&quot;, held in London in 1998, and &quot;Contemporary Chinese Art in the International Arena&quot; held at the British Museum in 2002.

The centre also began to develop global contacts to introduce international artists to the UK audiences. In 1997, Champion undertook a research trip to China with the aim of introducing the centre to international audiences and developing partnerships with organisations in mainland China. As a result, the centre produced &quot;Representing the People&quot; (1999), its first major touring exhibition to feature works by artists from mainland China. Developed in collaboration with the Courtyard gallery, Beijing, the exhibition was seen by approximately 250,000 people, and has been seen as one of the first independent UK exhibition to present the work of artists from Mainland China. This was followed by a second touring show, &quot;Made in China&quot; (2001-2002) which showcased contemporary design from China.

In June 2001, the centre was informed that it had been accepted on to the Arts Council of England&#x27;s lottery programme and £2.1 million was reserved for the centre to purchase and outfit a new building as well as fund the operations and marketing of the new venue.

===Chinese Art Centre, Thomas Street, (2003–2013)===

The new venue on Thomas Street opened on 28 November 2003, after the organisation had received a £2.2 million lottery grant from Arts Council England. The new building, designed by OMI Architects
and awarded a RIBA prize for architecture in 2004, featured a large gallery space, teahouse, shop, offices, resource area, and studio and living area for resident artists. The centre opened with a specially-commissioned work by New York-based artist, Xu Bing.
Champion stated at the time that the organisation had remained in the Northern Quarter as the centre represented &quot;a younger British/Chinese and International Chinese artists who tend to produce much more contemporary work&quot;, the venue was better placed in an &quot;&quot;arts and cultural setting rather than a Chinatown setting&quot;.&quot;

Between 2005 and 2007, the centre developed a relationship with Live Art UK to promote the work of performance artists from China and the Chinese diaspora. As a result, the centre organised the &quot;China Live&quot; tour in collaboration with Shu Yang, director of the DaDao Live Art Festival, Beijing., and the &quot;VITAL Festivals&quot; in 2006–2007. The Festivals presented Live Art performances, film screenings, and artists&#x27; talks, presentations, and a conference associated with performance artists from China and of Chinese heritage.

===Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art (2013–2020)===
In October 2013, the Chinese Arts Centre became the Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art (CFCCA), cementing the organisation position as: During this period the centre focused its programming and curatorial activities on &quot;The Chinese Century&quot;, an idea that the 21st century would be one dominated culturally and economically, not by western powers, but by China. Becky Kennedy observes that this notion calls for a shift away from considering Britain or the West as the centre of contemporary cultural thinking, and as suggested by the CFCCA&#x27;s new mission statement, implies that issues of diversity and representation in the context of 21st century Britain are outmoded and/or have even been reversed.

In 2013, CFCCA formed a collaborative partnership with the University of Salford to build a collection of Chinese Contemporary Art in Salford. The collection would include works by international artists and would be developed with input from the curators at CFCCA and academics at the University of Salford. In the same year, CFCCA developed their relationships with local and national government, which lead CFCCA being the launch venue of the Manchester China Forum co-hosted by CFCCA&#x27;s curator Ying Tan and the then Chancellor of the Exchequer and Conservative MP, George Osborne. The event was widely seen as a bid to bring Chinese investment into the city as part of Osborne&#x27;s vision for a Northern Powerhouse.

=== Revisioning and rebranding as esea contemporary (2020–) ===
Following public accusations of racism made against the centre in early 2020, and the withdrawal of several artists from exhibitions in 2020, CFCCA embarked on a &#x27;Revisioning&#x27; project to help shift the organisation towards better practices and positive change. As part of this project, CFCCA appointed a working group of artists to help co-design the new organisation. The group, who were all of East or Southeast Asian heritage, was formed of Enoch Cheng, Whiskey Chow, Yuen Ling Fong Gayle Chong Kwan, Eelyn Lee, Erika Tan, and Jack Tan. The artist working group was later dismissed after raising concerns of institutional racism, and following an accusation from the centre that the artists&#x27; complaints were harmful and threatening to white staff. The artists highlighted a concern previously raised by the artist JJ Chan, that CFCCA normalised racism within its own organisation and contributed to the normalisation of racism in British society more widely. Under the new leadership, the organisation rebranded as esea contemporary (referring to the term ESEA and its broader focus on art from diaspora communities) in 2023 and announced a new slate of exhibits that year, the first since the centre&#x27;s closure in 2021.

==Controversies and criticisms of the centre==
The centre has faced criticism over its focus and the content of its programme:

* In the early 1990s, the centre made an effort to remain politically neutral so as not to exclude any member of the east Asia diaspora due to their origins. However, the review in 1993 highlighted that this had affected the status of the centre as it had developed a reputation of not dealing with anything political. As a result, some artists and art organisations avoided the centre as they felt its stance was a form of censorship.

* After the move to Edge Street, the centre moved away from its original community focus, which has been seen to have alienated members of Manchester&#x27;s Chinese community. In its recent history, the centre has begun to try to bridge the gap and gain back trust from the community which originally founded the centre.
* In March 2020, artist JJ Chan issued an open letter to the centre, highlighting the artist&#x27;s perceptions of systemic problems with the centre and how the dominant voices in conversations in the UK about &#x27;Chinese&#x27; arts were predominately white voices. The criticism was expanded further in an article in the &quot;ArtAsiaPacific&quot; magazine.
*In May 2021, an international panel of artists, who were recruited to an Artist Working Group set up by the centre to help revision the organisation, called for a public boycott and immediate defunding of the centre by Arts Council England, after the group was ousted from their roles after raising issues around institutional racism at the centre. At the time, the organisation received £287,481 a year in public funding. All 7 artists appointed to the Artist Working Group cited CFCCA&#x27;s refusal to acknowledge a culture of racism within the organisation following the writing of a public report on the organisation&#x27;s work, as the reason for their public campaign. The group claimed that the centre was not fit for purpose as a public arts organisation.
*In June 2021, following further reports of racism at the centre from artists internationally, as well as former and current members staff, all members of the board of trustees who were not white resigned from their voluntary roles, with the exception of one.
*In November 2021, Vice World News reports that the centre cancelled a planned public discussion panel tackling institutional racism, due to what the director had called the centre&#x27;s own &quot;white fragility&quot;. The comment was widely criticised by artists, and the centre has not reopened any exhibitions since the cancelation of the event.

==Collections==
===Art collection===
Since 2013, the centre has worked in partnership with the University of Salford to build a collection of Chinese contemporary art works. The collection is held by the Salford Museum and Art Gallery.

===Archive and library===
Following a project funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Centre opened its library and archive to the public in 2018. The library contains publications collected by the Centre relating to Chinese contemporary art, including exhibition catalogues, artist monographs, and festival publications. The archive collections contain the record of the centre and its predecessors, covering the development of the centre, and its programme history.

<doc id="749803" wikidata="Q937096" url="?curid=749803" title="John Martin (painter)">
<text>John Martin (19 July 1789 – 17 February 1854) was an English Romanticist painter, engraver, and illustrator. He was celebrated for his typically vast and dramatic paintings of religious subjects and fantastic compositions, populated with minute figures placed in imposing landscapes. Martin&#x27;s paintings, and the prints made from them, enjoyed great success with the general public, with Thomas Lawrence referring to him as &quot;the most popular painter of his day&quot;. He was also lambasted by John Ruskin and other critics.

==Early life==
Martin was born in July 1789, in a one-room cottage, at Haydon Bridge, near Hexham in Northumberland, the fourth son of Fenwick Martin, a one-time fencing master. He was apprenticed by his father to a coachbuilder in Newcastle upon Tyne to learn heraldic painting, but owing to a dispute over wages the indentures were cancelled, and he was placed instead under Boniface Musso, an Italian artist, father of the enamel painter Charles Muss.

With his master, Martin moved from Newcastle to London in 1806, where he married at the age of nineteen. He supported himself by giving drawing lessons, and by painting in watercolours, and on china and glass — his only surviving painted plate is now in a private collection in England. His leisure was occupied in the study of perspective and architecture.

His brothers were William, the eldest, an inventor; Richard, a tanner who became a soldier in the Northumberland Fencibles in 1798, rising to the rank of Quartermaster Sergeant in the Grenadier Guards and fought in the Peninsular War and at Waterloo; and Jonathan, a preacher tormented by madness who set fire to York Minster in 1829, for which he stood trial.

==Beginnings as artist==
Martin began to supplement his income by painting sepia watercolours. He sent his first oil painting to the Royal Academy in 1810, but it was not hung. In 1811 he sent the painting once again, when it was hung under the title &quot;A Landscape Composition&quot; as item no.46 in the Great Room. Thereafter, he produced a succession of large exhibited oil paintings: some landscapes, but more usually grand biblical themes inspired by the Old Testament. His landscapes have the ruggedness of the Northumberland crags, while some authors claim that his apocalyptic canvasses, such as &quot;The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah&quot;, show his familiarity with the forges and ironworks of the Tyne Valley and display his intimate knowledge of the Old Testament.

In the years of the Regency from 1812 onwards there was a fashion for such ‘sublime’ paintings. Martin&#x27;s first break came at the end of a season at the Royal Academy, where his first major sublime canvas &quot;Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion&quot; had been hung—and ignored. He brought it home, only to find there a visiting card from William Manning MP, who wanted to buy it from him. Patronage propelled Martin&#x27;s career.

This promising career was interrupted by the deaths of his father, mother, grandmother and young son in a single year. Another distraction was William, who frequently asked him to draw up plans for his inventions, and whom he always indulged with help and money. But, heavily influenced by the works of John Milton, he continued with his grand themes despite setbacks. In 1816 Martin finally achieved public acclaim with &quot;Joshua Commanding the Sun to Stand Still upon Gibeon&quot;, even though it broke many of the conventional rules of composition. In 1818, on the back of the sale of the &quot;Fall of Babylon&quot; for £420 (equivalent to £ in 2015), he finally rid himself of debt and bought a house in Marylebone, where he came into contact with artists, writers, scientists and Whig nobility.

==Painter of repute==
Martin&#x27;s triumph was &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot; (1820), of which he boasted beforehand, &quot;it shall make more noise than any picture ever did before... only don&#x27;t tell anyone I said so.&quot; Five thousand people paid to see it. It was later nearly ruined when the carriage in which it was being transported was struck by a train at a level crossing near Oswestry.

In private Martin was passionate, a devotee of chess—and, in common with his brothers, swordsmanship and javelin-throwing—and a devout Christian, believing in &quot;natural religion&quot;. Despite an often cited singular instance of his hissing at the national anthem, he was courted by royalty and presented with several gold medals, one of them from the future Russian Tsar Nicholas I, on whom a visit to Wallsend colliery on Tyneside had made an unforgettable impression: &quot;My God,&quot; he had cried, &quot;it is like the mouth of Hell.&quot; Martin became the official historical painter to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, later the first King of Belgium. Leopold was the godfather of Martin&#x27;s son Leopold, and endowed Martin with the Order of Leopold. Martin frequently had early morning visits from another Saxe-Coburg, Prince Albert, who would engage him in banter from his horse—Martin standing in the doorway still in his dressing gown—at seven o&#x27;clock in the morning. Martin was a defender of deism and natural religion, evolution (before Charles Darwin) and rationality. Georges Cuvier became an admirer of Martin&#x27;s, and he increasingly enjoyed the company of scientists, artists and writers—Charles Dickens, Michael Faraday and J. M. W. Turner among them. Between 1849 and 1853, Martin took a home near Turner in Chelsea, London.

Martin began to experiment with mezzotint technology, and as a result was commissioned to produce 24 engravings for a new edition of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;—perhaps the definitive illustrations of Milton&#x27;s masterpiece, of which copies now fetch many hundreds of pounds. Politically his sympathies are not clear; some claim he was a radical, but this is not borne out by known facts, although he knew William Godwin, the ageing reformed revolutionist, husband of Mary Wollstonecraft and father of Mary Shelley; and John Hunt, co-founder of &quot;The Examiner&quot;.

At one time the Martins took under their wing a young woman called Jane Webb, who at twenty produced &quot;The Mummy!&quot; a socially optimistic but satirical vision of a steam-driven world in the 22nd century. Another friend was Charles Wheatstone, professor of physics at King&#x27;s College, London. Wheatstone experimented with telegraphy and invented the concertina and stereoscope; Martin was fascinated by his attempts to measure the speed of light. Accounts of Martin&#x27;s evening parties reveal an astonishing array of thinkers, eccentrics and social movers; one witness was a young John Tenniel—later the illustrator of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s work—who was heavily influenced by Martin and was a close friend of his children. At various points Martin&#x27;s brothers were also among the guests, their eccentricities and conversation adding to the already exotic flavour of the fare.

==Paintings==
His first exhibited subject picture, &quot;Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion&quot; (now in the St. Louis Art Museum), was hung in the Ante-room of the Royal Academy in 1812, and sold for fifty guineas. The piece depicts a scene from the &quot;Tales of Two Genii&quot;. It was followed by the &quot;Expulsion&quot; (1813), &quot;Adam&#x27;s First Sight of Eve&quot; (1813), &quot;Clytie&quot; (1814), &quot;Joshua Commanding the Sun to Stand Still upon Gibeon&quot; (1816) and &quot;The Fall of Babylon&quot; (1819). In 1820 appeared his &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot;, which excited much favourable and hostile comment, and was awarded a prize of £200 at the British Institution, where the &quot;Joshua&quot; had previously carried off a premium of £100. Then came &quot;The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum&quot; (1822), &quot;The Creation&quot; (1824), the &quot;Eve of the Deluge&quot; (1840), and a series of other Biblical and imaginative subjects. &quot;The Plains of Heaven&quot; is thought by some to reflect his memories of the Allendale of his youth.

Martin&#x27;s large paintings were closely connected with contemporary dioramas or panoramas, popular entertainments in which large painted cloths were displayed, and animated by the skilful use of artificial light. Martin has often been claimed as a forerunner of the epic cinema, and there is no doubt that the pioneer director D. W. Griffith was aware of his work.&quot; In turn, the diorama makers borrowed Martin&#x27;s work, to the point of plagiarism. A version of &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot; was mounted at a facility called the British Diorama in 1833; Martin tried, but failed, to shut down the display with a court order. Another diorama of the same picture was staged in New York City in 1835. These dioramas were tremendous successes with their audiences, but wounded Martin&#x27;s reputation in the serious art world. The painting &quot;The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah&quot;, 1852 is currently at the Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle upon Tyne.

Following their exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1841, &quot;Pandæmonium&quot;, picturing a scene from &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, and &quot;The Celestial City and the River of Bliss&quot; were bought by civil and mechanical engineer Benjamin Hick. After Hick&#x27;s death, in 1842, the two paintings were auctioned by Thomas Winstanley &amp; Sons of Liverpool at the Exchange Gallery in Manchester, in February 1843. &quot;Pandæmonium&quot; and its frame designed by Martin can be seen at the Louvre.

==Engravings==
In addition to being a painter, John Martin was a mezzotint engraver. For significant periods of his life, he earned more from his engravings than his paintings. In 1823, Martin was commissioned by Samuel Prowett to illustrate John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, for which he was paid 2,000 guineas. Before the first 24 engravings were completed he was paid a further 1500 guineas for a second set of 24 engravings on smaller plates. Some of the more notable prints include &quot;Pandæmonium&quot; and &quot;Satan Presiding at the Infernal Council&quot;, remarkable for the science fiction element visible in the depicted architecture, and arguably his most dramatic composition &quot;Bridge over Chaos&quot;. Prowett issued 4 separate editions of the engravings in monthly instalments, the first appearing on 20 March 1825 and the last in 1827. Later, inspired by Prowett&#x27;s venture, between 1831 and 1835 Martin published his own illustrations to accompany the Old Testament but the project was a serious drain on his resources and not very profitable. He sold his remaining stock to Charles Tilt who republished them in a folio album in 1838 and in a smaller format in 1839.

==Later life==
His profile was raised further in February 1829 when his elder brother, non-conformist Jonathan Martin, deliberately set fire to York Minster. The fire caused extensive damage and the scene was likened by an onlooker to Martin&#x27;s work, oblivious to the fact that it had more to do with him than it initially seemed. Jonathan Martin&#x27;s defence at his trial was paid for with John Martin&#x27;s money. Jonathan Martin, known as &quot;Mad Martin&quot;, was ultimately found guilty but was spared the hangman&#x27;s noose on the grounds of insanity.

Martin from about 1827 to 1828 had turned away from painting, and became involved with many engineering plans and inventions. He developed a fascination with solving London&#x27;s water and sewage problems, and published various pamphlets and plans dealing with the metropolitan water supply, sewage, dock and railway systems. His ideas involved the creation of the Thames embankment, containing a central drainage system. His plans were visionary, and formed the basis for later engineers&#x27; designs. His 1834 plans for London&#x27;s sewerage system anticipated by some 25 years the 1859 proposals of Joseph Bazalgette to create intercepting sewers complete with walkways along both banks of the River Thames. He also made plans for railway schemes, including lines on both banks of the Thames. The plans, along with ideas for &quot;laminating timber&quot;, lighthouses, and draining islands, all survive. Martin&#x27;s upbringing near one of Britain&#x27;s most active centers of coal mining led to a life-long interest in the infrastructure and safety of mining.

Debt and family pressures, including the suicide of his nephew (Jonathan&#x27;s son Richard), brought on depression, which reached its worst in 1838.

From 1839 Martin&#x27;s fortunes recovered and he exhibited many works during the 1840s. During the last four years of his life Martin was engaged in a trilogy of large paintings of biblical subjects: &quot;The Last Judgment&quot;, &quot;The Great Day of His Wrath&quot;, and &quot;The Plains of Heaven&quot;, of which two were bequeathed to Tate Britain in 1974, the other having been acquired for the Tate some years earlier. They were completed in 1853, just before the stroke which paralysed his right side. He was never to recover and died on 17 February 1854, at Douglas, Isle of Man. He is buried in Kirk Braddan cemetery. Major exhibitions of his works are still mounted.

==Legacy==

Martin enjoyed immense popularity and his influence survived. One of his followers was Thomas Cole, founder of American landscape painting. Others whose imaginations were fired by him included Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Brontës – a print of &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot; hung on the parlour wall of the Brontë parsonage in Haworth, and his works were to have a direct influence upon the writings of Charlotte and her sisters, who as children played with a model of him. Martin&#x27;s fantasy architecture influenced the Glasstown and Angria of the Brontë juvenilia, where he himself appears as Edward de Lisle of Verdopolis.

Martin enjoyed a European reputation and influence. Heinrich Heine wrote of the music of Hector Berlioz that &quot;It makes me see visions of fabulous empires and many a cloud-capped, impossible wonder. Its magical strains conjure up Babylon, the hanging gardens of Semiramis, the marvels of Nineveh, the mighty constructions of Mizraim, as we see them in the pictures of the English painter Martin.&quot;

Martin&#x27;s work influenced the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood – especially Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and several generations of movie-makers, from D. W. Griffith, who borrowed his Babylon from Martin, to Cecil B. DeMille and George Lucas. Writers like Rider Haggard, Jules Verne, and H. G. Wells were influenced by his concept of the sublime. The French Romantic movement, in both art and literature, was inspired by him. Much Victorian railway architecture was copied from his motifs, including his friend Brunel&#x27;s Clifton Suspension Bridge. A number of Martin&#x27;s engineering plans for London which included a circular connecting railway, though they failed to be built in his lifetime, came to fruition many years later. This would have pleased him inordinately – he is known to have exclaimed to his son, Leopold, that he would rather have been an engineer than painter.

Like some other popular artists, Martin fell victim to changes in fashion and public taste. His grandiose visions seemed theatrical and outmoded to the mid-Victorians, and after Martin died his works became neglected and gradually forgotten. &quot;Few artists have been subject to such posthumous extremes of critical fortune, for in the 1930s his vast paintings fetched only a pound or two, while today they are valued at many thousands.&quot;

In the 1930s and 1940s his work again came to be appreciated. Connections between his dramatic style and the arts and culture of the historically charged post-war period in Britain has been assessed by Anguix-Vilches who sees post-World War II enthusiasm for depictions of the Apocalypse as allowing Martin’s work to survive.

A number of Martin&#x27;s works survive in public collections: the Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle – which also holds his famous &quot;black cabinet&quot; of projects in progress; Tate Britain, the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, the Louvre, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., Yale Center for British Art, Saint Louis Art Museum and elsewhere in the USA. The RIBA holds many of his engineering pamphlets. There are letters in private collections and at Queen Mary College in London. John Martin wrote two autobiographies, the first an article in &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; of 14 June 1834, page 459 and the most extensive in &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;, 17 March 1849, pp. 176–177. A major source for his life is a series of reminiscences by his son Leopold, published in sixteen parts in the &quot;Newcastle Weekly Chronicle&quot; in 1889. There are a number of surviving letters and reminiscences by, among others, B.R. Haydon, John Constable, Ralph Waldo Emerson, the Rossettis, Benjamin Disraeli, Charlotte Brontë and John Ruskin – a persistent critic who, even so, admitted Martin&#x27;s uniqueness of vision. The first full biography was that by Mary L. Pendered whose chief source, Martin&#x27;s friend Sergeant Ralph Thomas, wrote a diary – now lost – of their friendship. Thomas Balston then wrote two biographies on the artist, the first in 1934, and the second (still the leading biography) in 1947. Christopher Johnstone produced an introductory book on Martin 1974, and in 1975 the art critic William Feaver was author of an extensively illustrated work on Martin&#x27;s life and works. Since 1986, Michael J. Campbell has produced a number of publications on John Martin, including the leading publication on his work as an original printmaker, published by the Royal Academy of Arts, Madrid, in 2006.

In 2011–12 Tate Britain and Newcastle&#x27;s Laing Art Gallery co-curated a major retrospective exhibition of Martin&#x27;s work in all genres -&quot;John Martin – Apocalypse&quot; – including his contribution as a civil engineer. Featured in the exhibition was the fully restored &quot;The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum&quot;, 1822. Recorded as lost in the disastrous Tate Gallery flood of 1928, the painting was rediscovered by Christopher Johnstone, a research assistant at the gallery, when he was researching his book &quot;John Martin&quot; (1974). Its restoration by Tate conservator Sarah Maisey, reveals that the original paintwork was in near pristine condition; a large area of missing canvas has been repainted by Maisey using techniques that were not available in 1973 as she describes on page 113 of the exhibition catalogue &quot;John Martin: Apocalypse&quot; (2011). When rediscovered the painting was rolled up inside the missing Paul Delaroche painting &quot;The Execution of Lady Jane Grey&quot; which was returned to the National Gallery, London.

==Family==

===Wife and children===

With his wife Susan, née Garrett, who was nine years older than him, Martin had six children who survived to adulthood: Alfred (who worked with his father as a mezzotint engraver and later became a senior tax official), Isabella, Zenobia (who married the artist Peter Cunningham), Leopold (who became a clerk), Charles (1820–1906), who was trained as a painter by his father, copying a number of his father&#x27;s works – he later became a successful portrait painter and lived in America, his last exhibit at the Royal Academy being in 1896 – and Jessie (who married Egyptologist Joseph Bonomi). Leopold was the godson of the future King Leopold I of Belgium, who had met and befriended Martin when they shared lodgings on Marylebone High Street in about 1815. Leopold later wrote a series of reminiscences of his father, published in the &quot;Newcastle Weekly Chronicle Supplement&quot; in 1889. Leopold accompanied his father on many walks and visits, and his anecdotes include encounters with J. M. W. Turner, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, William Godwin and Charles Wheatstone. Leopold married the sister of John Tenniel, later famous as the cartoonist of &quot;Punch&quot; and illustrator of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;.

===Martin&#x27;s brothers===

Martin&#x27;s eldest brother, William (1772–1851) was by turn a rope-maker, soldier, inventor, scientist, writer and lecturer, who attempted to develop a rival philosophy to &quot;Newtonian&quot; science, allowing for perpetual motion, and denying the law of gravity. Despite undoubted elements of &quot;quackery and buffoonery&quot;, William had a great talent for inventing. In 1819 he produced a miner&#x27;s safety lamp which was said to be better and more reliable than that of Sir Humphry Davy. The only recognition he achieved in this field was a silver medal from the Royal Society for the invention of the spring balance. The second eldest brother, Richard, was a quartermaster in the guards, serving throughout the Peninsular War, and was present at Waterloo. Jonathan, the third eldest brother, (1782–1838) achieved notoriety by setting fire to York Minster in February 1829. He was subsequently apprehended, tried and found not guilty on the grounds of insanity. He was confined to St Luke&#x27;s Hospital for Lunatics in London, where he remained until his death.
