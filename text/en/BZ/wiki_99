<text>Cetacean surfacing behaviour is a grouping of movement types that cetaceans make at the water&#x27;s surface in addition to breathing. Cetaceans have developed and use surface behaviours for many functions such as display, feeding and communication. All regularly observed members of the order Cetacea, including whales, dolphins and porpoises, show a range of surfacing behaviours. 

Cetacea is usually split into two suborders, Odontoceti and Mysticeti, based on the presence of teeth or baleen plates in adults respectively. However, when considering behaviour, Cetacea can be split into whales (cetaceans more than 10 m long such as sperm and most baleen whales) and dolphins and porpoises (all Odontocetes less than 10 m long including orca) as many behaviours are correlated with size. 

Although some behaviours such as spyhopping, logging and lobtailing occur in both groups, others such as bow riding or peduncle throws are exclusive to one or the other. It is these energetic behaviours that humans observe most frequently, which has resulted in a large amount of scientific literature on the subject and a popular tourism industry.

== Travelling surface behaviour ==
=== Breaching and lunging === 
A &quot;breach&quot; or a &quot;lunge&quot; is a leap out of the water, also known as cresting. The distinction between the two is fairly arbitrary: cetacean researcher Hal Whitehead defines a breach as any leap in which at least 40% of the animal&#x27;s body clears the water, and a lunge as a leap with less than 40% clearance. Qualitatively, a breach is a genuine jump with an intent to clear the water, whereas a lunge is the result of a fast upward-sloping swim that has caused the whale to clear the surface of the water unintentionally. This latter &quot;lunging&quot; behaviour is often a result of feeding in rorquals. The right, humpback, and sperm whales are the most widely observed jumpers. However other baleen whales such as fin, blue, minke, gray and sei whales also breach. Oceanic dolphins, including the orca, are very common breachers and are in fact capable of lifting themselves completely out of the water very easily, although there is little distinction between this and porpoising. Some non-cetacean marine creatures also exhibit breaching behavior, such as several shark species and rays of the genera &quot;Manta&quot; and &quot;Mobula&quot;.

Two techniques are used by cetaceans in order to breach. The first method, most common in sperm and humpback whales, is conducted by swimming vertically upwards from depth, and heading straight out of the water. The other more common method is to travel close to the surface and parallel to it, and then jerk upwards at full speed with as few as 3 tail strokes to perform a breach. In all breaches the cetacean clears the water with the majority of its body at an acute angle, such as an average of 30° to the horizontal as recorded in sperm whales. The whale then turns to land on its back or side, and less frequently may not turn but &quot;belly flop&quot; instead. In order to achieve 90% clearance, a humpback needs to leave the water at a speed of eight metres per second or . For a animal, this results in a momentum of 288 thousand newton seconds. Despite its energetic cost, breaching is often carried out in series. The longest recorded sustained series was by a humpback near the West Indies totaling 130 leaps in less than 90 minutes. Repeated breaches tire the animal, so less of the body clears the water each time.

Ultimately, the reasons for breaching are unknown; however, there is evidence to support a range of hypotheses. Whales are more likely to breach when they are in groups, suggesting that it is a non-verbal signal to other group members during social behaviour. Scientists have called this theory &quot;honest signalling&quot;. The immense cloud of bubbles and underwater disturbance following a breach cannot be faked; neighbours then know a breach has taken place. A single breach costs a whale only about 0.075% of its total daily energy intake, but a long series of breaches may add up to a significant energy expenditure. A breach is therefore a sign that the animal is physically fit enough to afford energy for this acrobatic display, hence it could be used for ascertaining dominance, courting or warning of danger. It is also possible that the loud &quot;smack&quot; upon re-entering is useful for stunning or scaring prey, similar to lobtailing. As breaching is often seen in rough seas it is possible that a breach allows the whale to breathe in air that is not close to the surface and full of spray, or that they use breaching to communicate when the noise of the ocean would mask acoustic signals. Another widely accepted possible reason is to dislodge parasites from the skin. The behaviour may also be more simply a form of play.

=== Porpoising ===

&quot;Porpoising&quot;, also known as running, is a high speed surface behaviour of small cetaceans where long jumps are alternated with swimming close to the surface. Despite the name, porpoising behaviour is seen in dolphins and porpoises, as well as other marine species such as penguins and pinnipeds. When marine mammals are travelling at speed they are forced to stay close to the surface in order to maintain respiration for the energetic exercise. At leisurely cruising speeds below 4.6 m/s, dolphins swim below the water&#x27;s surface and only briefly expose their blowholes along with up to one third of their body at any one time. This results in little splashing as they have a very streamlined shape. Porpoising occurs mainly when dolphins and porpoises are swimming at speeds greater than 4.6 m/s. Here, jump length is roughly equal to distance traveled when the cetaceans are submerged. This exposes the blowhole for longer which is needed to get enough oxygen to maintain metabolism and therefore high speeds over long periods of time. Studies have also shown that leaping is more energetically efficient than swimming above a certain threshold speed. This is due to the reduction in friction when travelling in air compared to water which saves more energy than is needed to produce the leap. These benefits also outweigh the energy wasted due to the large amount of splashing often seen when groups are porpoising. Porpoising is therefore a result of high speed swimming which cetaceans use for important pursuit and escape activities. For example, dolphins may be seen porpoising away from their main predator, sharks or the direction of incoming boats to avoid collision.

Although porpoising is a useful product of rapid swimming, much variation seen in the behaviour cannot be explained by this cause alone; it has likely evolved to provide other functions. For example, the rotation during porpoising by the spinner dolphin leads to much splashing and is more common at slower speeds so cannot be attributed to an energy saving mechanism. It is therefore more likely to be a form of play or communication within or between pods. Another reason might be to remove barnacles or remoras that, when attached, increase drag during swimming. When spinner dolphins impact the water the combination of centrifugal and vertical force upon these ectoparasites can be up to 700 times their own weight and so efficiently remove them. Other theories suggest that cetaceans may porpoise in order to observe distant objects such as food by looking for visual cues, such as birds dive-bombing a bait ball. Research into the additional functions of porpoising has so far been focussed on the more acrobatic species, but it is likely that other cetaceans also use it for these, and perhaps unknown, reasons too.

=== Wave or bow-riding and following vessels ===

The term &quot;wave-riding&quot; is most commonly used to describe the surface activity of cetaceans that approach boats and jump repeatedly in the waves produced by the boats. This includes &quot;bow-riding&quot;, where cetaceans are in the pressure wave in front of the boat, and &quot;wake-riding&quot;, where they are off the stern in the wake. Cetaceans swim using fluke propulsion when experiencing wave energy below the threshold needed for riding, such as when boats travel at speeds slower than 3 m/s or when they are outside of the peak wave energy zone. However, at higher speeds dolphins and porpoises will seek out the pressure wave and its maximum energy zone in order to ride the wave by holding their flukes in a fixed plane, with only minor adjustments for repositioning. Wave-riding reduces the energetic cost of swimming to the dolphin, even when compared to slower swimming speeds. For example, heart rate, metabolic rate and transport cost was reduced by up to 70% during wave-riding compared to swimming at speeds 1 m/s slower in bottlenose dolphin. Wave-riding behaviour can be performed by dolphins from minutes up to several hours, and therefore is a useful energy-saving mechanism for swimming at higher speeds.

Wave-riding is most common in small Odontocetes. It has also been observed in larger cetaceans such as false killer whales and orca, although most larger Odontocetes do not seek out any form of interaction with boats. Bow-riding is the most common form of interactive behaviour with boats across a variety of smaller Odontocete species, such as dolphins in the genera &quot;Stenella&quot; and &quot;Delphinus&quot;. The type of interaction can often depend on the behavioral state of the group as well as species. For example, spotted dolphins are more likely to interact when travelling or milling but less likely when they are socialising or surface feeding. Interactive behavior may also depend on group composition, as both orca and bottlenose dolphins have been recorded to interact mostly when a calf was in the group. This indicates that groups with calves may approach boats in order to teach the young how to interact safely to avoid collision. Another result of cetaceans traveling in pods is an increase in competition for the optimal wave energy and so maximum energy saving position. Position of individuals may reflect the dominance hierarchy of the pod and therefore could be used to ascertain dominance. Several rorquals, such as minke, sei, bryde&#x27;s, humpback, and gray are also known to display actions in similar manners.

=== Spyhopping ===
When &quot;spyhopping&quot;, the whale rises and holds a vertical position partially out of the water, often exposing its entire rostrum and head. It is visually akin to a human treading water. Spyhopping is controlled and slow, and can last for minutes at a time if the whale is sufficiently inquisitive about whatever it is viewing. Generally, the whale does not appear to swim by fluke propulsion to maintain its &quot;elevated&quot; position while spyhopping, instead relying on exceptional buoyancy control and positioning with pectoral fins. Typically the whale&#x27;s eyes will be slightly above or below the surface of the water, enabling it to see whatever is nearby on the surface. Different species of sharks, including the great white shark and oceanic whitetip shark, have also been known to spyhop.

Spyhopping often occurs during a &quot;mugging&quot; situation, where the focus of a whale&#x27;s attention is on a boat, such as whale-watching tours, which they sometimes approach and interact with. On the other hand, spyhopping among orcas is thought to aid predation, as they are often seen around ice floes attempting to view prey species such as seals that are resting on the floes. When prey is detected the individual will conduct a series of spy-hops from different locations around it, then vocalise to the group members to do the same to possibly prepare for an attack. In this instance a spyhop may be more useful than a breach, because the view is held steady for a longer period of time. Often when cetaceans breach, their eyes do not clear the water, which suggests it might not be used for looking but instead for hearing. For example, gray whales will often spy-hop in order to hear better when they are near the line where waves begin to break in the ocean as this marks out their migration route.

=== Lobtailing and slapping ===

&quot;Lobtailing&quot; is the act of a whale or dolphin lifting its flukes out of the water and then bringing them down onto the surface of the water hard and fast in order to make a loud slap. Large whales tend to lobtail by positioning themselves vertically downwards into the water and then slapping the surface by bending the tail stock. Dolphins, however, tend to remain horizontal, either on their belly or their back, and make the slap via a jerky whole body movement. All species are likely to slap several times in a single session. Like breaching, lobtailing is common amongst active cetacean species such as sperm, humpback, right and gray whales. It is less common, but still occasionally occurs, amongst the other large whales. Porpoises and river dolphins rarely lobtail, but it is a very common phenomenon amongst oceanic dolphins. Lobtailing is more common within species that have a complex social order than those where animals are more likely to be solitary. Lobtailing often occurs in conjunction with other aerial behaviour such as breaching. Species with large flippers may also slap them against the water for a similar effect, known as pectoral slapping.

The sound of a lobtail can be heard underwater several hundred metres from the site of a slap. This has led to speculation amongst scientists that lobtailing is, like breaching, a form of non-vocal communication. However, studies of bowhead whales have shown that the noise of a lobtail travels much less well than that of a vocal call or a breach. Thus the lobtail is probably important visually as well as acoustically, and may be a sign of aggression. Some suggest that lobtailing in humpback whales is a means of foraging. The hypothesis is that the loud noise causes fish to become frightened, thus tightening their school together, making it easier for the humpback to feed on them. In this instance, lobtail feeding behaviour appeared to progressively spread throughout the population, as it increased from 0 to 50% of the population using it over the 9-year study. As no individual under 2 years old nor any mothers were observed to use lobtail feeding it suggests that it is taught in foraging groups. The spread of lobtail feeding amongst humpback whales indicates its success as a novel foraging method.

=== Peduncle throw ===
A &quot;peduncle throw&quot;, also known as &quot;peduncling&quot;, is a surfacing behaviour unique to humpback whales. During this the humpback converts its forward momentum into a crack-the-whip rotation, pivoting with its pectorals as it drives its head downward and thrusts its entire fluke and peduncle (the muscular rear portion of the torso) out of the water and sideways, before crashing into the water with terrific force. Peduncling takes place among the focal animals (female, escort, challenging male) in a competitive group, apparently as an aggressive gesture. Possibilities include escorts fending off a particular challenging male, females who seem agitated with an escort, or an individual not comfortable with a watching boat&#x27;s presence. Occasionally, one whale performs a series of dozens of peduncle throws, directed at the same target each time.

=== Pectoral slapping ===
&quot;Pectoral slapping&quot;, informally known as pec-slapping, is when a cetacean turns on its side, exposes one or both pectoral fins into the air, and then slaps them against the surface of the water. It is a form of non-vocal communication commonly observed in a variety of whale and dolphin species as well as seals. The motion is slow and controlled, and the behaviour can occur repeatedly by one individual over a few minutes. The humpback whale&#x27;s pectoral fin is the largest appendage of any mammal and humpbacks are known for their extremely acrobatic behaviour. Pec-slapping varies between groups of different social structure, such as not occurring in lone males but being common in mother calf pairs and also when they are accompanied by an escort. The reasons for pec-slapping therefore can vary depending on age and sex of individual humpback whales. During the breeding season adult males pec-slap before they disassociate with a group of males that are vying for a female, whereas adult females pec-slap to attract potential mates and indicate that she is sexually receptive. Its function between mother calf pairs is less well known but is likely to be a form of play and communication that is taught to the calf by the mother for use when it is sexually mature. Pectoral slapping has also been observed in the right whale, but due to its smaller size, the sound produced will be quieter and therefore used for communication over smaller distances unlike the humpback. Exposure of the pectoral fin and consequent slapping has also been infrequently observed in blue whales, where it is most often a by-product of lunge feeding followed by rolling on to its side.

=== Logging ===

&quot;Logging&quot; is a behaviour that whales exhibit when at rest and appear like &quot;logs&quot; at the surface. It is defined as lying without forward movement at the surface of the water with the dorsal fin or parts of the back are exposed. Whales often rest for periods of time under the surface in order to sleep in mainly horizontal positions, although sperm whales also rest vertically. However, as they consciously need to breathe at the surface, they can rest only one-half of their brain at a time, known as unihemispheric slow-wave sleep. This sleep pattern has been identified in all five cetacean species that have been tested for it thus far. Cetaceans intermittently come to the surface in order to breathe during these sleep periods and exhibit logging behaviour. Logging can occur interchangeably with surface resting behaviour when cetaceans are travelling slowly, which is particularly common in mother-calf pairs, as the young tire quickly during swimming. Logging is common, particularly in right whales, sperm whales, pilot whales and humpback whales. Another behaviour that may be mistaken for logging is &quot;milling&quot;, where a group of cetaceans at the surface have little or no directional movement but instead socialise with each other. This behaviour is particularly common in large groups of pilot whales.

==Dive times==
Time intervals between surfacing can vary depending on the species, surfacing style or the purpose of the dive; some species have been known to dive for up to 85 minutes at a time when hunting, and dives in excess of three hours have been observed in Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale under extreme circumstances.

== Human interaction ==
Whale watching is carried out on every continent, with an estimated 13 million people participating in 2008. This, when combined with the sustained increase in boat vessel traffic, has likely affected the surface activity of cetaceans. When boats and other whale watching vessels approach, most cetaceans will either avoid or seek interactions. The occasions where no effect is seen is predominantly when the cetaceans are travelling or feeding, but not when they are showing surface activity. In the case of avoidance, the animals may dive rather than staying submerged near the surface or move horizontally away from the vessels. For example, when sperm whales are approached by boats they surface less, shorten the intervals between breathes and do not show their fluke before diving as often. Cetaceans may also reduce their acrobatic surfacing behaviours, such as when humpback whale groups without calves are approached by vessels to within 300 m. Avoidance behaviour is typical of whales, but interactions are more common in whale groups that contain calves and also in the smaller odontocetes. For example, studies on killer whales in North America have shown that the focal animals increased their tail-slapping behaviour when approached by boats within 100 m, and that 70% of surface active behaviours (SABs) in these orca were seen when a boat was within 225 m. Similarly, dusky dolphins also jump, change direction and form tighter groups more when boats are present, particularly when they do not adhere to the regulations about approach. As an increase in SABs is beneficial to the whale watching tours&#x27; participants, the tours may be encouraged to approach cetaceans closer than recommended by guidelines. There is a lack of understanding about the long-term effects of whale-watching on the behaviour of cetaceans, but it is theorised that it may cause avoidance of popular sites, or a decrease in the energy budget for individuals involved.

<doc id="755848" wikidata="Q3361724" url="?curid=755848" title="Scooter (Muppet)">
<text>Scooter is a Muppet character from the sketch comedy television series &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, known for being the backstage stage manager, utility stage crew member, and general all-around &quot;gofer&quot;&quot;.&quot; He was originally performed by Richard Hunt until his death in 1992, and is currently performed by David Rudman.

==Characteristics==
Scooter is orange with a darker orange sprout of hair. In keeping with the jokes about bespectacled Muppets such as Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, Scooter&#x27;s eyes are actually the lenses of his glasses. Hunt based Scooter&#x27;s personality on his own self from when he was younger.

A few things have been revealed about Scooter&#x27;s family. As cited in &quot;Of Muppets and Men&quot;, when pressed about his family, he explained that his mother was a parrot but he didn&#x27;t know about his father. However, this is not necessarily canonical. Scooter&#x27;s uncle J.P. Grosse is a humanoid Muppet, suggesting that Scooter is meant to be one as well.

In the animated series &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;, he was redesigned as a brainy, computer-knowledgeable child and given a tomboyish twin sister named Skeeter, who never appeared as a live-action Muppet. However, she later appears as an adult in the &quot;Muppet Show&quot; comic series story arc &quot;Family Reunion&quot;.

==Roles==
Originally, Scooter got his job as a &quot;gofer&quot; because his rich uncle J. P. Grosse owned the theatre, and he maintained it through a combination of efficiency and nepotism. Originally, Scooter would often use his family connection to his advantage, making unreasonable demands on his uncle&#x27;s behalf.

His antagonistic role was gradually discarded, and he became a legitimate assistant to Kermit, with the two becoming friends. Eventually, his job was often closer to that of a stage manager, or even that of a subordinate producer, and he would do whatever he could to help Kermit to (albeit unsuccessfully) keep order among the Muppets.

In the second through fourth seasons, Scooter featured in the cold openings, where he would enter the guest star&#x27;s dressing room to tell them that there are only &quot;fifteen seconds to curtain.&quot; However, the number of seconds sometimes changed. In the dressing room, a gag or short comical sketch would occur before the opening theme song. For the fifth season, a new style of cold opening featuring Pops replaced this format.

Scooter sometimes helped Miss Piggy to get Kermit to be romantically interested in her. He was also on good terms with Fozzie Bear, being less annoyed with his jokes than most people, and they performed duets and double acts onstage in a few episodes.

His relationship with Floyd Pepper, who frequently appeared backstage, may be comparable to Hunt&#x27;s relationship with Jerry Nelson. The two puppeteers frequently collaborated, with the elder Nelson helping the younger Hunt to develop his performing abilities from the start. Hunt and Nelson were also known for being vocally talented, and Scooter sat in with the band on occasion (as a vocalist or guest musician). Scooter and Floyd&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Mr. Bass Man&quot; symbolizes Hunt and Nelson&#x27;s relationship.

Scooter has appeared in most Muppet films and television specials. In &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;, Scooter acts as The Electric Mayhem&#x27;s manager. In &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot;, he was a resident of the Happiness Hotel. In &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot;, he was among the core group who attended college together and struggled to put their show on. In this appearance, he was the treasurer of the group, and later took a leadership role in Kermit&#x27;s brief, amnesia-fueled absence, making decisions for the group to follow. Also, Scooter makes an appearance in the pre-show queue at the Disney attraction, &quot;Muppet*Vision 3D&quot;, located at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios.

After his original performer&#x27;s death in 1992, Scooter was not seen again until 1999 when he had a cameo in &quot;Muppets from Space&quot;, with one line of dialogue. He had somewhat larger roles in subsequent productions, beginning with &quot;It&#x27;s a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie&quot; (2002). In &quot;The Muppets&#x27; Wizard of Oz&quot; (2005), he played the Wizard&#x27;s assistant. He also took on supporting roles in the second &quot;Studio DC: Almost Live&quot; special (2008) and in &quot;A Muppet Christmas: Letters to Santa&quot; (2008).

Scooter later appears in &quot;The Muppets&quot; (2011) where he is working at Google and on his way to the TED conference, iPad in hand, when he is first seen. Just as in &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot;, Scooter here appears as a leading figure of the Muppets – he spearheads the clean-up and repairs of the Muppet Studio, and even takes over hosting duties for Kermit at one point. He has also been promoted to stage manager, a role he reprises in &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot; when the Muppets go on a world tour.

In the TV show &quot;The Muppets&quot;, he is the talent coordinator on &quot;Up Late with Miss Piggy&quot;.

He has a prominent role in &quot;Muppets Now&quot;, co-hosting Pepe&#x27;s Unbelievable Game Show as well as having the responsibility of uploading the series onto Disney+ on time.

==Casting history==
Scooter was first performed by Richard Hunt (1976–1992) until his death. Unlike most major Muppets, Scooter has been performed by seven different people. After a seven-year retirement following Hunt&#x27;s death, the character went through a series of short-lived performers (1999–2005) before finding a new performer in David Rudman (2008–present).

<doc id="755859" wikidata="Q7728739" url="?curid=755859" title="The Daily of the University of Washington">
<text>The Daily of the University of Washington (usually referred to in Seattle simply as The Daily) is the student newspaper of the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington. It is staffed entirely by University of Washington students, excluding the publisher, advertising adviser, accounting staff, and delivery staff.

&quot;The Daily&quot; features regular news, sports, opinion, and arts &amp; leisure sections, as well as weekly science and wellness sections and an online podcast.

In addition to its regular daily and weekly sections, &quot;The Daily&quot; publishes a number of special sections every year. An edition of &quot;The Game Daily&quot; is published before each home football and men&#x27;s basketball game, and is distributed on campus and at the tailgate party before the game. Other special sections throughout the year often include &quot;The Holidaily&quot;, &quot;Sex Edition&quot;, &quot;Spring Break Edition&quot;, &quot;Outdoors Guide&quot;, &quot;Greek Edition&quot;, &quot;Career Guide&quot;, and &quot;Housing Guide&quot;. A special &quot;Graduation Edition&quot; and &quot;Salute to Grads&quot; are distributed on campus, at all graduation exercises, and commencement.

Additionally, &quot;The Daily&quot; publishes a magazine: &quot;Pacific Wave&quot;.

&quot;The Daily&quot; is overseen by the Board of Student Publications, which consists of representatives from the Associated Students of the University of Washington (ASUW), the Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS), the Faculty Senate, the UW Department of Communication, the UW administration, the &quot;Daily&quot; newsroom, and a local professional publication.

==History==
&quot;The Daily&quot; was founded in September 1891 as &quot;The Pacific Wave&quot; and ran under that title until June 5, 1908, having absorbed the short-lived campus paper &quot;The College Idea&quot; which ran during the 1895–1896 school year. The newspaper became a daily with its September 15, 1908 issue and changed its name to &quot;The Pacific Daily Wave&quot;. This name lasted until May 21, 1909, and the paper became &quot;The University of Washington Daily&quot; when the 1909–1910 school year began.

&quot;The University of Washington Daily&quot; ceased publishing Monday issues in 1933 during the Great Depression. It became &quot;The Daily of the University of Washington&quot; in 1976, and in 1985 it resumed publishing on Mondays.

In 2007, &quot;The Daily&quot; became a partner with Next Door Media and jointly launched udistrictdaily.com, a blog that reports on the U-District in Seattle, Washington.

In 2010, &quot;The Daily&quot; created a half-hour television companion show called &quot;The Daily&#x27;s Double Shot&quot;. The first episode premiered on UWTV, Channel 27 on February 5, 2010, with new episodes premiering every two weeks during the academic year.

In 2016, &quot;The Daily&quot; switched to a twice weekly print schedule on Mondays and Thursday, with regular online content the other weekdays.

In 2018, &quot;The Daily&quot; switched to a once weekly print schedule on Mondays, with regular online content the other weekdays.

In 2020, as a result of the novel coronavirus pandemic, &quot;The Daily&quot; switched to a twice weekly email newsletter, with regular online content every weekday.

As of June 2021, &quot;The Daily&quot; plans to resume its once weekly print schedule on Mondays, continue its twice weekly email newsletter, and publish other print products including sports-focused Game Dailies, quarterly Pacific Wave magazines, and other special sections.

==Awards==
&quot;The Daily&quot; is one of the most awarded college newspapers in the United States.

Former awards include Newspaper of the Year from the Associated Collegiate Press in 1996, 1997 and 2000; and the Mark of Excellence Award for the Best All Around Newspaper in the nation from the Society of Professional Journalists in 1997.

At the 2010 National College Media Conference &quot;The Daily&quot; earned the Pacemaker for General Excellence, Best of Show, Story of the Year Editorial/Opinion, Story of the Year Diversity and Multimedia Story of the Year. &quot;The Daily&quot; also earned the 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 Apple Award for the best four-year college newspaper (tabloid) in the United States at the CMA Spring Convention in New York City. It has also been recognized with the 2007, 2008 and 2009 Mark of Excellence Award for the Best All-Around Newspaper in Region 10 (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Alaska) by the Society of Professional Journalists. It was a finalist for the 2009 Pacemaker Newspaper of the Year, and earned second place for Best of Show at the National College Media Conference.

==Controversy==
===2008 gay marriage op-ed===
In November 2008, &quot;The Daily&quot; ran an op-ed column written by John Fay, a columnist, which criticized gay marriage as part of a point/counterpoint regarding the passage of Proposition 8 in California. The piece was accompanied by an illustration of a man standing next to a sheep, referencing Fay&#x27;s statement that allowing gay marriage would lead to legal bestiality. Among other controversial statements, Fay argued that &quot;being homosexual, like other emotional tendencies, doesn&#x27;t make someone a bad person, but it&#x27;s a problem that needs to be dealt with, not denied.&quot; The article sparked outrage among the student body, and students assembled in the Husky Union Building to protest, claiming that the article encouraged &quot;fear and hate&quot;.

The Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS) drafted a resolution at their December 3, 2008, meeting to have the editor-in-chief and opinion editor to either apologize for the publication of the opinion piece and illustration, or to resign. Editor-in-chief Sarah Jeglum stated that she supported balanced viewpoints and did not plan to give the apology as requested. She encouraged groups and individuals to continue to voice their various opinions and to have &quot;The Daily&quot; act as a public forum for a variety of opinion. The GPSS then passed a resolution at its February 4, 2009 meeting to direct the Graduate and Professional Student Senate representative on the Board of Student Publications to vote for censure of Jeglum.

On February 10, 2009, the Associated Students of the University of Washington (ASUW) passed a resolution supporting &quot;the independence of &quot;The Daily&quot; as a member of the free press&quot;, and &quot;its right to publish controversial material provided it is within the bounds of speech protected by the first amendment and THAT the ASUW finds that printing this article did not cross those legal boundaries and did not violate &quot;The Daily&quot;″s code of ethics, thus a call for censure of Sarah Jeglum is not warranted.&quot;

The Board of Student Publications met on February 19 to consider the GPSS resolution to censure Sarah Jeglum. The Board voted with two yea, and five nay; the resolution failed to be adopted.

ASUW then considered another resolution in response to the GPSS attempt to censure, to establish Free Speech and National Freedom of Speech Week during the third week of October.

===2021 ASUW election cartoon===
On April 26, 2021, &quot;The Daily&quot; published its annual ASUW Elections endorsements as well as separate cartoon that attempted to caricature the uncontested elections process by suggesting that student voters write in random campus icons on their ballots. The endorsements and cartoons were criticized by many students as being racist, pointing out the language in the endorsements calling a majority-POC ticket of candidates &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;unprepared&quot; as well as the inclusion of the UW Medicinal Herb Garden monkey statue as one of the proposed write-in suggestions. Quickly following these criticisms, the cartoon was taken down and the cartoonist issued a personal apology for the harm caused by its publication.

The ASUW President, Camille Hattwig, issued a &quot;Response to 04/26 Post from &quot;The Daily,&quot;&quot; emailing it to all students campus-wide on April 28, 2021. The message, in its entirety, read: &quot;We were deeply alarmed to see the recent publication of racist imagery from The Daily surrounding the current ASUW elections. All students and student leaders deserve to be treated with basic respect, and ASUW stands in solidarity with the candidates. The ASUW calls on The Daily for legitimate accountability for publishing racist material aimed directly at other students. We are grateful for the continued work of past, present and future generations of student leaders within and outside of ASUW who continue to work to make our university equitable for marginalized students. Every day we are reminded there is more work to be done.&quot;

Following this email, many students took to Twitter and Reddit to share their confusion with the vague email as not every student had seen the endorsements nor the cartoon, nor understood that the ASUW was referencing those pieces. Many of the same students shared their opinion of the endorsements and cartoon after a copy was posted in the Reddit group, the majority of whom claimed they did not feel either piece contained racist intent nor content and felt the ASUW had overstepped its authority. Some students organized a recall petition which, if it collected enough signatures, would begin recall proceedings against Camille Hattwig. The petition, while gaining hundreds of signatures, did not meet the threshold and no further action was taken against ASUW.

On April 29, 2021, Editor in Chief Mac Murray published a Letter from the Editor, issuing an apology and action steps &quot;The Daily&quot; would take to rectify the situation.

<text>Two central issues for democracies are the right to candidate, and suffrage or the franchise—that is, the decision as to who is entitled to vote. For example, Athenian democracy limited the vote to male citizens, while slaves, foreigners, and women of any status were excluded. Requirements and exclusions such as these, along with racial prohibitions, have been common in democracies. The definition of legal personhood has been historically tied up with these questions.

Generally, franchise is restricted on account of one or more of the following:
*age (in all democracies),
*gender,
*nationality,
*race,
*religion,
*wealth,
*birth (&quot;e.g.&quot;, inherited social status),
*education,
*previous crimes, etc.

Most contemporary democracies agree that only age, citizenship and (in some jurisdictions) serious, previously-committed crimes are the only of these restrictions which apply. One prominent exception to this is the limited representation available for denizens of the capital of the United States, Washington, DC (see District of Columbia voting rights). The legal basis of the right to candidacy and right to create a political party (nomination rules) are less clear than voting rights (suffrage) in the United States.

A recent example of how the &quot;right to vote&quot; changed over history is New Zealand, which was the first country to give women the right to vote (September 19, 1893), though not the right to be elected. The participation in politics &quot;via&quot; both candidacy and suffrage in Europe and the Americas is, largely, a 20th-century phenomenon.

Sex equity has been recognized in other ways in other societies, however. The Iroquois Confederacy gave a strong political role to women perhaps to as far back as its origins in the 12th century, although, as in 19th century New Zealand, this was expressed as support for a specific male, not the right to sit in council. The Iroquois Confederacy, like many Native American societies, recognized rituals to allow post-menopausal or powerful widowed women to assume the role of a man—because of this, it is possible that at some point in its history, the Confederacy permitted a full and formal role to women.

Some limited (to a greater or lesser degree) alternative voting and official appointing systems claim to be democratic. One-party states such as the People&#x27;s Republic of China apply a limited form of disapproval voting that helps to signal the acceptance of those promoted into new posts. Those who do not receive very high (over 80%) acceptance generally rise no further in rank or position.

Under perestroika, shortly before its collapse, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics under Mikhail Gorbachev implemented reforms to allow multiple candidates, all from the local Communist Party, to run against each other. Such methods are not generally viewed as providing an equivalent political expression to the right to replace an entire centralized power group by way of election, as can occur in a multi-party system.

Another means of limited democracy is that practiced in the Islamic Republic of Iran, where the right to run as a candidate is controlled by the religious authorities. Such groups as the Communist Party and the Green Party of Iran are excluded from the slate of candidates. Recent elections in Iran have suffered from very low turnout.

In the United States of America, restrictions on the right to vote due to property ownership or lack thereof, and in some places literacy, were common until the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Today all but a few states deny the right to vote to those who have been convicted of a felony at any point in their past (voting rights are, in some cases, restored &quot;via&quot; executive (on the state or federal level) pardon).

In the European Union every citizen has the right to participate in the elections of the European Parliament. Not every vote is counted equally, however: Voters from bigger countries are significantly underrepresented relative to voters from smaller countries. E.g., a vote from Luxembourg carries 12 times as much weight as does a vote from Germany. Many places have similar problems with the distribution of votes per region. In the US, a Californian vote carries four times the weight of a Montana vote in the presidential election.

<text>The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, also called the Baltimore Basilica, is a Catholic cathedral in Baltimore, Maryland. It was the first Catholic cathedral built in the United States after the nation&#x27;s founding, and was among the first major religious buildings constructed therein after the adoption of the U.S. Constitution.

As a co-cathedral, it is one of the seats of the Catholic Archdiocese in Baltimore, Maryland. Additionally it is a parish church (ranked minor basilica) and national shrine. It is considered the masterpiece of Benjamin Henry Latrobe, the &quot;Father of American Architecture&quot;.

==History==
The Basilica was constructed between 1806 and 1863 to a design of Benjamin Henry Latrobe (1764–1820), America&#x27;s first professionally trained architect and Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Architect of the U.S. Capitol. It was built under the guidance of the first American bishop of the Roman Catholic Church, John Carroll. The Basilica was blessed and opened for use on May 31, 1821, by the third Archbishop of Baltimore, Ambrose Maréchal. It was consecrated on May 25, 1876, by Archbishop James Roosevelt Bayley.

Many famous events have occurred within its walls, including the funeral Mass of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, the only Catholic signatory of the Declaration of Independence. Carroll had been the last of the surviving signers. Most of the first American bishops were consecrated here to fill the ever-multiplying dioceses necessitated by the young country&#x27;s territorial expansion and the great growth of the American Catholic population. Until recent years, more priests were ordained at the Baltimore Basilica than in any other church in the United States.

The building hosted many of the 19th-century meetings that shaped the Catholic Church in America, including seven Provincial Councils and three Plenary Councils. Among other effects, these led to the founding of The Catholic University of America and efforts to evangelize African and Native Americans to Catholicism. The Third Plenary Council, which was the largest meeting of Catholic bishops held outside Rome since the Council of Trent, commissioned the Baltimore Catechism.

In 1862, while in Maryland during the Civil War&#x27;s Peninsula campaign, Union General Joseph Warren Revere (grandson of Paul Revere) visited the Basilica. General Revere was compelled to convert to Catholicism, and he did so despite the ongoing war. On October 19, 1862, Reverend H. B. Coskery baptized Revere at the Basilica. Revere&#x27;s Holy Communion took place on October 26.
In 1937, Pope Pius XI raised the cathedral to the rank of Minor Basilica. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969, and two years later was declared a National Historic Landmark. In 1993, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops designated the Basilica as a National Shrine.

The Cathedral Hill Historic District takes its name from the Basilica&#x27;s location.

Many people deemed holy by the Catholic Church are associated with the Basilica, including the Blessed Foundress of the Oblate Sisters of Providence, the first order for Catholic nuns of African-American descent, Mother Mary Lange; Blessed Michael J. McGivney, founder of the Knights of Columbus, who was ordained a priest at the Basilica in 1877 by Archbishop James Gibbons; and St. John Neumann, who is credited with founding America&#x27;s Catholic school system.

The Basilica has welcomed millions of visitors, including Pope John Paul II in 1995, Mother Teresa in 1996, and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople in 1997. The building has also been visited by at least 20 other saints or potential saints.

Archbishop William E. Lori, Archbishop of Baltimore, celebrated the 200th anniversary of the dedication of the Baltimore Basilica on May 31, 2021.

==Architecture==
The cathedral is a monumental neoclassical-style building designed in conformity to a Latin cross basilica plan — a departure on Latrobe&#x27;s part from previous American church architecture, but in keeping with longstanding European traditions of cathedral design. The plan unites two distinct elements: a domed space and a longitudinal axis.

===Exterior===

The principal feature of the main façade is a classical Greek portico with Ionic columns arranged in double hexastyle pattern, immediately behind which rise a pair of cylindrical towers. Architectural historian Henry-Russell Hitchcock believed that the onion-shaped domes atop the two towers were “not of Latrobe&#x27;s design,” but now it is believed that they &quot;were entirely the architect&#x27;s own.&quot; The exterior walls are constructed of silver-gray gneiss quarried from the Ellicott City Granodiorite.

===Interior===
The interior is occupied by a massive dome at the crossing of the Latin cross plan, creating a centralizing effect which contrasts the exterior impression of a linear or oblong building. Surrounding the main dome is a sophisticated system of barrel vaults and shallow, saucer-like secondary domes. The light-filled interior designed by Latrobe was striking in contrast to the dark, cavernous recesses of traditional Gothic cathedrals.

The Basilica houses many precious works of art, including two heroic portraits: the first entitled &quot;Descent from the Cross&quot; by Pierre-Narcisse Guérin and the second, by Baron Charles de Steuben, depicts Louis IX of France burying his plague-stricken troops before the siege of Tunis at the beginning of the Eighth Crusade in 1270. Both portraits were gifts of King Louis XVIII of France shortly after the 1821 opening of the Basilica.

===Dome===

Latrobe originally planned a masonry dome with a lantern on top, but his friend Thomas Jefferson suggested a wooden double-shell dome (of a type pioneered by French master builder Philibert Delorme) with 24 half-visible skylights. For the inner dome Latrobe created a solid, classically detailed masonry hemisphere. Grids of plaster rosettes adorn its coffered ceiling.

===21st-century restoration===

A 32-month, $34 million restoration project was completed in 2006. The restoration included a total incorporation of modern mechanical systems throughout the building, while also restoring the interior to Latrobe&#x27;s original design. Many &quot;misguided accretions&quot; were corrected. The original wall colors (pale yellow, blue, and rose) were restored, as was the light-colored marble flooring which for decades had been a dark green color. Twenty-four skylights in the main dome were re-opened, and the stained glass windows (installed in the 1940s) were given to St. Louis parish in Clarksville (whose new church was designed around them) and replaced with clear glass windows.

Additionally, the Basilica&#x27;s crypt was made accessible to the public, as well as the expansive masonry undercroft (basement) of the church. The undercroft, until 2006, had been filled with sand from the original building of the cathedral, which prevented Carroll and Latrobe&#x27;s vision of a Chapel in the undercroft. During the restoration, the sand was removed, and the Our Lady Seat of Wisdom Chapel was finally realized.

Cardinal William Keeler, then Archbishop of Baltimore, and one of the many champions of the restoration project, completed the restoration without dipping into the coffers of the Archdiocese, instead using private funds donated for the sole purpose of the restoration. The Basilica was closed to the public from November 2004 through November 2006, reopening in time for the Basilica&#x27;s Bicentennial and the biannual meeting of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, which was held in Baltimore to mark the occasion.

The historic pipe organ was originally built by 
Thomas Hall (1821), and later rebulilt by Hilborne L. Roosevelt, (1884), Lewis &amp; Hitchcock (1931), Schantz Organ Company, (1989) and Andover Organ Company (2006). The organ was played in recital during the Organ Historical Society Convention in July 2024.

==== 2011 earthquake ====
On August 23, 2011, an earthquake that jolted the East Coast from Georgia to Quebec rattled through the Basilica, sending nearly 1,000 linear feet of cracks through its ceilings and walls. A seven-month, $3 million restoration was completed on Easter Sunday 2012.

==Notable interments==
Nine of the fourteen deceased Archbishops of Baltimore have been laid to rest in the Basilica&#x27;s historic crypt. The crypt is located beneath the main altar, next to the &quot;Our Lady Seat of Wisdom&quot; Chapel, and is accessible to the public. Resting in the crypt are:

* Samuel Eccleston, P.S.S., fifth Archbishop of Baltimore: October 19, 1834 — April 22, 1851
* Francis Patrick Kenrick, sixth Archbishop of Baltimore: August 19, 1851 — July 8, 1863
* Martin John Spalding, seventh Archbishop of Baltimore: May 6, 1864 — February 7, 1872

*William Cardinal Keeler, fourteenth Archbishop of Baltimore: May 23, 1983 — July 12, 2007

==Historic designations==
The Basilica of the Assumption was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 1, 1969, and was made a National Historic Landmark in November 1971. It is the centerpiece of the Cathedral Hill Historic District. The basilica is within Baltimore National Heritage Area.

<text>Witcham is a small village near Ely in Cambridgeshire, England.

The village is surrounded by fenland farms and has a village hall and a 13th-century church dedicated to St Martin. It has a pub called the White Horse, which was the winner of the Ely and District CAMRA Rural Pub of the Year Award 2006, 2010, 2011 and Overall Pub of the Year Award 2011. It also has a fine village green.

The village hosts the World Pea Shooting Championships on the second Saturday in July every year and has staged the competition annually since 1971.

Witcham is built around a cross-roads in the centre of the village with each of the four roads having housing on each side for 50-200m. The north-bound street is called &quot;Martins Lane&quot;, the east-bound street is &quot;High Street&quot;, south-bound is &quot;The Slade&quot;, and west-bound is &quot;Silver Street&quot;, which leads to the more recent housing developments of &quot;Westway Place&quot; and &quot;The Orchards&quot;.
The name of the village derives from &quot;Wycham&quot;, meaning &quot;place of the wych elms&quot;, after the trees that used to grow there in significant numbers. A Roman cavalry helmet dating from the first century AD, known as the Witcham Gravel helmet, was found in the village gravel pit, and now resides in the British Museum.
The village school was sited on the South side of High Street, opposite and a little East of St.Martin&#x27;s church, and was open as an infants and junior school from 1873 until 1982. When the school closed the pupils instead went to Mepal or Sutton. A local archive has further images of the school.

==Witcham Gravel==
Historically, Witcham Parish had several detached portions in the outlying Fens. By 1896, boundary changes had reduced these detached portions to one, separated from the main by a small parish called Witcham Gravel. Witcham Gravel was placed in Ely Urban District, whereas the two parts of Witcham proper were included in Ely Rural District. This situation persisted until 1933, when Witcham Gravel parish was merged into Witcham.

<doc id="755874" wikidata="Q16144287" url="?curid=755874" title="Châtelain">
<text>Châtelain was originally the French title for the keeper of a castle.

==History==
With the growth of the feudal system, the title gained in France a special significance which it never acquired in England since the Norman conquest, as implying the jurisdiction of which the castle became the centre. The &quot;châtelain&quot; was originally, in Carolingian times, an official of the &quot;comte&quot; (count); with the development of feudalism the office became a fief, and so ultimately hereditary. In this as in other respects the &quot;châtelain&quot; was the equivalent of the viscount. Sometimes the two titles were combined, but more usually there were no viscounts in provinces where &quot;châtelains&quot; existed and no &quot;châtelains&quot; in those with viscounts.

The title &quot;châtelain&quot; continued also to be applied to the inferior officer, or concierge &quot;châtelain&quot;, who was merely a castellan in the English sense. The power and status of &quot;châtelains&quot; necessarily varied greatly at different periods and places. Usually their rank in the feudal hierarchy was equivalent to that of the &quot;Sire&quot; (medieval French) or lord (), between the baron and the chevalier; but occasionally they were great nobles with an extensive jurisdiction, as in the Low Countries (see Burgrave).

This variation was most marked in the cities, where in the struggle for power that of the &quot;châtelain&quot; depended on the success with which he could assert himself against his feudal superior, lay or ecclesiastical, or, from the 12th century onwards, against the rising power of the communes. The &quot;châtellenie&quot; (&quot;casteliania&quot;), or jurisdiction of the &quot;châtelain&quot;, as a territorial division for certain judicial and administrative purposes, survived the disappearance of the title and office of the &quot;châtelain&quot; in France, and continued until the Revolution.

The feminine form, &quot;châtelaine&quot;, refers to the mistress of a castle or château, or the mistress of any large medieval household. It can also refer to a woman&#x27;s ornamental chain worn around the waist, with keys, a purse, timepiece, or other household attachments.

==Canada==
In Canada, the wife of the Governor General (the Viceregal consort of Canada), is referred to by the nominal and symbolic title &quot;Châtelaine of Rideau Hall&quot;, in diplomatic and ceremonial protocol for Canadian and British government ceremonies and special events.

<text>The Boro (बर&#x27;/बड़ो ), also called Bodo, are a Tibeto-Burman speaking ethnolinguistic group native to the state of Assam in India. They are a part of the greater Bodo-Kachari family of ethnolinguistic groups and are spread across northeastern India. They are concentrated mainly in the Bodoland Territorial Region of Assam, though Boros inhabit all other districts of Assam and Meghalaya.

Boros were listed under both &quot;Boro&quot; and &quot;Borokachari&quot; in The Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950, and are continued to be called so in the Census of India documents. Boros speak the Boro language, a Boro-Garo language of the Tibeto-Burman family, which is recognised as one of twenty-two Scheduled languages of India. Over two-thirds of the people are bilingual, speaking Assamese as second language. The Boro along with other cognate groups of Bodo-Kachari peoples are prehistoric settlers who are believed to have migrated at least 3,000 years ago. Boros are mostly settled farmers, who have traditional irrigation, dong.

The Boro people are recognised as a plains tribe in the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, and have special powers in the Bodoland Territorial Region, an autonomous division; and also as a minority people.

==Etymology==
Boro is the self-designation or autonym of the community. &quot;Boro&quot; comes from &quot;Bara-fisa&quot;, which means &quot;son of Bara&quot;, and &quot;Bara&quot; stands for &quot;man&quot; or &quot;male member&quot; of the group. In the cognate language Kokborok, &quot;Borok&quot; means man (&#x27;k&#x27; being a suffix for nouns) and so logically, &quot;Boro&quot; would mean &quot;man&quot; even in the Boro language. Generally, the word &quot;Boro&quot; means a &quot;man&quot;, in the wider sense &quot;Boro&quot; means a &quot;human being&quot; (but not specific to a female member of the family) in the languages used by the Bodo-Kachari peoples.

==Language==

The Boro language is a member of the Sino-Tibetan language family. It belongs to the Boro–Garo group of the Tibeto-Burman languages branch of the Sino-Tibetan family. It is an official language of the state of Assam and the Bodoland Territorial Region of India. It is also one of the twenty-two languages listed in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India.

==Religion==
Traditionally, Boros practised Bathouism, which is the worshiping of supreme God, known as &quot;Obonglaoree&quot;. The shijou tree is taken as the symbol of Bathou and worshiped. It is also claimed as the supreme god. In the Boro language, Ba means five and thou means deep. Since Boros believe in the five mighty elements of God – land, water, air, fire, and ether – the number five has become significant in the Bathou culture, which is similar to the five elements of other Asian religions.

According to Bathouism, before the creation of the universe there was simply a great void, in which the supreme being &#x27;Aham Guru&#x27;, Anan Binan Gosai or Obonglaoree existed formlessly. Aham Guru became tired of living a formless existence and desired to live in flesh and blood. He descended on this great void with all human characteristics and created the universe.

In addition to Bathouism, Boro people have also been converted to Hinduism, especially Hoom Jaygya. For this worship through fire ceremony, a clean surface near a home or courtyard is prepared. Usually, worship offerings include a betel nut called a &#x27;goi&#x27; and a betel leaf called a &#x27;pathwi&#x27; or &#x27;bathwi&#x27; and rice, milk, and sugar. Another important Hindu festival, the Kherai Puja, where an altar is placed in a rice field, is the most important festival of the Boros. However, caste and dowry practices are not practised by the majority of Boro Hindus, who follow a set of rules called Brahma Dharma. A majority of the Bodo people still follow Bathouism, but in censuses, they are often classified as Hindus, as their native religion has no official recognition under the Indian constitution.

Christianity is followed by around 10% of the Boros and is predominantly of the Baptist denomination. The major Boro Churches associations are the Boro Baptist Convention and Boro Baptist Church Association.

==History==
After the break-up of Kamarupa around the 12th century till the colonial times (19th century) and beyond different ethnic groups settled in different ecological regions but the constant movements and intermixing of peoples led to the development of distinctive but hybrid cultural practices. According to , even as different state systems emerged, expanded, and fell—such as the Mughals, the Koch, the Ahoms, and British colonialism—the Boros resisted entry into their fiscal systems and moved slowly but continuously to avoid them. Due to the expansion of these states and the expansion of tenured peasantry, the Boros were those who finally converged close to the forested regions of the lower Himalayan foothills.

In this habitat, the Boros practised shifting cultivation for self-sustenance and controlled forest products. To cultivate in this difficult terrain the Boros developed innovative low-cost irrigation systems that supported shifting cultivation. Landholding, sowing and harvesting, irrigation, and hunting were all performed collectively. As those who controlled forest based produce, they emerged as intermediaries in the trade in these as well as other goods between the plains and the hills and complex relationships developed. The Boros remained shifting cultivators at least till the 18th century and then slowly became less mobile; even during the colonial period, most Boros refused permanent land tenure or made no effort to secure landholding documents.

When the Koch dynasty (1515–1949) consolidated its rule in the 16th century into the regions that the Boro people had settled in, it demarcated the region north of the Gohain Kamal Ali—which came to be called the Duars—as the region where non-Brahmin culture could thrive. After the Ahom kingdom consolidated its power in western Assam in the 17/18th century it made special arrangements with Bhutan to share administrative and fiscal responsibilities. But when the British banned forest lands from being used for cultivation in the last quarter of the 19th century the Boros suffered a major habitat loss since the forest lands historically used for shifting cultivation and the source of other produce suddenly became unavailable to them. To alienate indigenous peasants from their lands was a stated colonial aim, to make them available as labour in other enterprises.

===Boro identity formation===
Boros identity formation began in the colonial period, when the Boro elite and intelligentsia began differentiating themselves from the Assamese caste-Hindu society. The Boro, as well as many other communities as also much of the indigenous elite, were not exposed to education till the end of the 19th century, and it was by the early 20th century when a class of Boro/Kachari publicists finally emerged—a small Kachari elite formed in the early 20th century from among traders, school teachers and contractors. Foremost among them was Kalicharan Brahma, a trader from Goalpara who established a new monotheistic faith called &quot;Brahma-ism&quot; and most importantly, claimed for himself and his peers a new Bodo Identity. Whereas earlier educated Kacharis like Rupnath had few options for social mobility other than assimilating into the Hindu lower castes, thus the Brahma religion developed by the Bodos that asserted respectable and autonomous Bodo identity while rejecting the cast dominance, and by the 1921 census the Boros began giving up their tribal names and identifying themselves as &quot;Boro&quot; by caste and language and &quot;Brahma&quot; by religion. Additional avenues, via conversion to Christianity, were already available by the late 19th century especially with the evangelical work of Sidney Endle who is also known for his tome &quot;The Kacharis&quot;, and this formed a parallel stream of Boro articulation till much later times.

&quot;Boro&quot; as a self-referential term for all Kacharis was reported by Montgomery in 1838. &quot;Bodo&quot; was a term reported by Brian Houghton Hodgson (1847) as a endonym that, he speculated, encompassed a wide group of peoples that included in the minimum the Mech and the Kacharis. This led to two type of approaches to the Boro identity: one is the notion of a wide group was picked up by Kalicharan Brahma and his peers who posited the Boro identity in opposition to the caste-Hindu Assamese, and the other one, Jadunath Khakhlari who accepted the notion for the greater Bodo race but at the same time criticised it as a neologism and insisted on the use of the name Kachari and pointed to the Kachari&#x27;s contribution to the Assamese culture to underline their historical political legacy. Those of the Kacharis who preferred to progress socially by initiation into the Ekasarana Dharma are called Sarania Kachari and are not considered as Boros today.

===Pre-political Boro associations===
The period from 1919 saw the emergence of different Boro organisations: &quot;Bodo Chatra Sanmilan&quot; (Bodo Students Association), &quot;Kachari Chatra Sanmilan&quot; (Kachari Students Association), &quot;Bodo Maha Sanmilan&quot; (Greater Bodo Association), &quot;Kachari Jatiyo Sanmilan&quot; (Kachari Community Association), etc. These organisations pushed divergent means for social and political progress. For example, &quot;Bodo Chatra Sanmilan&quot; advocated giving up tribal attributes and wanted women to follow the ideals of &quot;Sita&quot; of Ramayana. Even as self-assertive politics was on, the Boros were not ready to severe their relationship with the greater Assamese society, with even Kalicharan Brahma advocating Assamese as the medium of instruction in schools, and Boro associations seeking patronage from Assamese figures who showed sympathy for their cause. In the absence of an acknowledged past history of state formation, the associations felt particularly pressed to show that the Boros were not primitive as some other tribal groups and at the same time did not fall into the caste-Hindu hierarchy.

The demand for community rights was made for the first time when at the 1929 Simon Commission the Boro leaders evoked colonial imagery of backward tribes and requested protection in the form of reserved representation in local and central legislatures. The Boro delegation to the Simon Commission included, among others, Kalicharan Brahma and Jadav Khakhlari. The delegation submitted that Goalpara should remain with Assam and should not be included with Bengal; and that the Boros were culturally close to the Assamese.

===Boros in colonial tribal politics===
The only human category in the pre-colonial times was &quot;jati&quot;. In the early 19th century the East India Company became interested in the &#x27;tribal&#x27; question owing to situations arising out of insurgencies against local rulers who were seeking British protection; but over the years the East India Company/British Raj evolved its role as saviours of the not the local rulers but the local people by offering to protect them against these rulers just as the primitive people of Africa needed protection. The notion of primitive vs non-primitive difference was further refined by the introduction of European notions of racial differences and by the census of 1872, categories such as &#x27;aboriginal tribe&#x27; and &#x27;semi-Hinduised aboriginals&#x27; emerged. The 1881 census proposed that India consisted of two hostile populations and thus did not possess a cohesive nationality. And by 1901 the official definition of a tribe was set down by Risley. Within this formulation Northeast India was seen as a special case that required separate legislation.

The elites from these social groups, including that from the Boros, used these categories for political articulation. The &quot;Tribal League&quot;, a full political organisation, emerged in 1933 as the common platform for all &quot;plains tribes&quot; of the Brahmaputra valley that included the &quot;Boro&quot;, &quot;Karbi&quot;, &quot;Mising&quot;, &quot;Tiwa&quot; and the &quot;Rabha&quot;. This formation excluded the &quot;hills tribes&quot; which were not allowed political participation. The colonial state and ethnographers&#x27; desire to define the tribal people, the need of the people to define themselves, and the earlier pre-political associations were significant contributory factors in the development of the &quot;tribal&quot; identity among the Boro and other groups.

The Tribal League, which included Boro leaders such as Rabi Chandra Kachari and Rupnath Brahma, succeeded in protecting the Line system in 1937 against the proposal by the Muslim League.

==Demographics==
Around 1.45 million Bodos are living in Assam, thus constituting 4.53% of the state population. A majority of them around 68.96% alone are being concentrated in Bodoland Territorial Region of Assam, numbering 1 million out of total 3.15 million population, thus constituting 31% of the region&#x27;s population. In Bodoland&#x27;s capital Kokrajhar, they are in minority, forming only 25% of the town&#x27;s population.

==Folk tradition and mythology==
The history of the Boro people can be explained from folk traditions. According to Padma Bhushan winner Suniti Kumar Chatterjee, mythologically, Boros are &quot;the offspring of son of the Vishnu (Baraha) and Mother-Earth (Basumati)&quot; who were termed &quot;Kiratas&quot; during the Epic period.

==Social groups==
&quot;Aroi&quot; or &quot;Ari&quot; or &quot;Ary&quot; is a suffix in Boro language, which means &quot;folk.&quot;

Some of the important clans of Boros are:
#Swargiary: The priestly clan, with &quot;Deoris&quot; and &quot;Ojhas&quot; selected from this clan.
#Basumatary: The land-holding clan. 
#Narzary: The clan associated with the jute cultivation and supply.

<text>Michael Francis Gilbert (17 July 1912 – 8 February 2006) was an English solicitor and author of crime fiction.

==Early life and education==
Born on 17 July 1912 in Billinghay, Lincolnshire, England, to Bernard Samuel Gilbert, a writer, and Berwyn Minna Cuthbert, Michael Gilbert from 1920 to 1926 attended St. Peter&#x27;s School in Seaford, East Sussex, and then , from 1926 to 1931, he attended Blundell&#x27;s School in Tiverton, Devon. He began to study law at London University but was unable to finish due to financial concerns. After becoming a schoolmaster at Salisbury Cathedral School, Gilbert returned to studying law, receiving his degree in 1937 and graduating with honours. It was at this time that he began to work on his first mystery novel, &quot;Close Quarters&quot;.

==Military service==
During the Second World War, Gilbert served with the British Army in North Africa and Italy with the Honourable Artillery Company. In 1943, he was captured and taken as a prisoner of war in northern Italy near Parma. Along with Eric Newby and Tom Davies, Capt. Gilbert escaped after the Italian surrender later that year, their escape involving a 500-mile journey south to reach the Allied lines.

==Law career==
In 1947, Gilbert joined the London law firm of Trower, Still &amp; Keeling in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. Eventually becoming a partner there, he practised law with the group until his retirement in 1983.

==Writing career==

Gilbert&#x27;s writing career spanned the years 1947 to 1999, with his final work being &quot;Over and Out&quot; (published in 1998). The genres his fiction novels enveloped included police procedurals, spy novels, short stories, courtroom dramas, classical mysteries, adventure thrillers, and crime novels. Following his death, &quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted one of Gilbert&#x27;s publishers regarding his writing style: &quot;Michael was an exceptionally fine storyteller, but he&#x27;s hard to classify. He&#x27;s not a hard-boiled writer in the classic sense, but there is a hard edge to him, a feeling within his work that not all of society is rational, that virtue is not always rewarded.&quot;.

Unlike many other fiction writers of the mystery and crime genre, Gilbert did not make use of a single recurring character. His works, however, did include characters that would appear irregularly: Inspector Hazlerigg; Inspector Petrella; Chief Superintendent Morrissey; Detective Chief Inspector Mercer, Mr. Calder and Mr. Behrens. Posthumously, four collections of his short stories were published. By 2016, his works consisted of 30 novels and approximately 185 stories in 13 collections. In addition to his novels, Gilbert wrote several stage plays along with numerous radio and television plays.

Gilbert was known for writing only during his five-times-a-week commute by train between his home in Kent and Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. He said that doing so allowed him to &quot;carry out a full and normal day&#x27;s work as a solicitor, and to devote the evenings and weekends to my family&quot;. Gilbert wrote 500 words a day during the 50-minute morning train trip, preferring &quot;a bit of hustle and bustle&quot; to silence while writing. Stating that commuting was a &quot;perfectly natural thing to do&quot;, he mused that after retirement he would &quot;have to find a railway journey every morning ... I&#x27;d have to go somewhere by train in order to continue writing&quot;.

While Gilbert&#x27;s earlier works were set in courtrooms and the offices of lawyers, his later works depicted police investigations and criminal acts. Some of Gilbert&#x27;s novels were set in a boys&#x27; boarding school. Others were about a serial thrill killer (&quot;The Night of the Twelfth&quot;); a television action hero and military advisor to the ruler of an Arab sheikdom (&quot;The Ninety-Second Tiger&quot;); suspense in Communist Hungary just prior to the 1956 uprising (&quot;Be Shot for Sixpence&quot;); municipal corruption in a seaside town (&quot;The Crack in the Teacup&quot;); Etruscan art relics (&quot;The Family Tomb&quot;); and IRA terrorists (&quot;Trouble&quot;).

== Music ==
Gilbert apparently had an abiding interest in, and deep knowledge of, music. Many of his earlier books contain scenes, some of them quite lengthy, involving choirs, in churches, cathedrals, boarding schools, and neighbourhood organizations. Additionally, a number of his secondary characters are accomplished musicians of one kind or another, some of them at the professional level. He also occasionally uses musical references to indicate a sudden change of direction in his present story. In a typical example from &quot;Paint, Gold and Blood&quot; (1989), the protagonist has just received an unexpected letter from an old school friend and opens the envelope:
A single note from a flute, or perhaps from a clarinet, had interrupted the rhythm of the tympani and the strings to announce the start of a new movement.

==Legacy, honours, critical acclaim==
In 1980, Gilbert was made a CBE. Writing honours include a Diamond Dagger from the Crime Writers Association for lifetime achievement in 1994, and being named a &quot;grandmaster&quot; by the Mystery Writers of America in 1988.

One of Gilbert&#x27;s earliest works, &quot;Smallbone Deceased&quot; (1950), was included in crime-writer H. R. F. Keating&#x27;s list, &quot;Crime &amp; Mystery: The 100 Best Books&quot;. In Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary, his American publisher, Kent Carroll of Carroll &amp; Graf, was quoted as saying: &quot;He was always so utterly urbane and civilized. He wrote about a sordid world from the perspective of a gentleman. There was something comforting as well as exciting about that.

British mystery writer and critic Julian Symons referred to Gilbert as a writer who chose not to offer &quot;personal feelings about the world and society&quot; but to write &quot;what will amuse his audience, and if an idea or a subject seems disturbing it is put aside&quot;. Symons went on to state, &quot;Yet there remains an impression that he is not quite content to be appreciated just as an entertainer, but that some restraint (legal caution, perhaps) checks him from writing in a way that fully expresses his personality&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Gilbert married Roberta Mary Marsden in 1947; together the couple had two sons and five daughters. One daughter, Harriett, born in 1948, became a novelist and broadcaster for BBC World Service.

Gilbert died at the age of 93 on 8 February 2006 at his home in Luddesdown, Gravesend, Kent. He was survived by Roberta, his wife of nearly sixty years, and all of their children.

<text>Denis Jean Achille Luchaire (; October 24, 1846November 14, 1908) was a French historian.

==Biography==
Luchaire was born in Paris. In 1879 he became a professor at Bordeaux and in 1889 professor of mediaeval history at the Sorbonne; in 1895 he became a member of the Académie des sciences morales et politiques, where he obtained the Jean Reynaud prize just before his death.

His grandnephew was the French journalist Jean Luchaire, a collaborationist with the Nazis during World War II.

==Works==
The most important of Achille Luchaire&#x27;s earlier works is his &quot;Histoire des institutions monarchiques de la France sous les premiers Capétiens&quot; (1883 and again 1891); he also wrote:
*&quot;Manuel des institutions françaises: période des Capétiens directs&quot; (1892)
*&quot;Louis VI le Gros, annales de sa vie et de son règne&quot; (1890)
*&quot;Étude sur les actes de Louis VII&quot; (1885).
His later writings deal mainly with the history of the papacy, and took the form of an elaborate work on Pope Innocent III. This is divided into six parts:
#&quot;Rome et Italie&quot; (1904)
#&quot;La Croisade des Albigeois&quot; (1905)
#&quot;La Papauté et l&#x27;Empire&quot; (1905)
#&quot;La Question d&#x27;Orient&quot; (1906)
#&quot;Les Royautés vassales du Saint-Siège&quot; (1908)
#&quot;Le Concile de Latran et la réforme de l&#x27;Église&quot; (1908)
He wrote two of the earlier volumes of Ernest Lavisse&#x27;s &quot;Histoire de France&quot;.

<text>William Michael Zabka (; born October 20, 1965) is an American actor. He portrayed Johnny Lawrence in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; (1984), &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot; (1986) and the TV series &quot;Cobra Kai&quot; (2018–2025).

Zabka&#x27;s career took off with &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;, despite having no prior karate training. During the 1980s, he appeared in the films &quot;Just One of the Guys&quot; (1985), &quot;Back to School&quot; (1986), and the television series &quot;The Equalizer&quot; (1986–1989). In the 1990s and 2000s, Zabka focused on independent films and filmmaking. In 2004, he was nominated for an Academy Award for co-writing and producing the short film &quot;Most&quot;. Zabka continued directing, including music videos for Rascal Flatts. In 2018, he reprised his role as Johnny Lawrence in the YouTube Red and Netflix series &quot;Cobra Kai&quot;, which he co-executive produces with Ralph Macchio. The series, set 33 years after the original film, explores the re-opening of the Cobra Kai dojo and the rekindling of the rivalry between Johnny Lawrence and Daniel LaRusso.

==Early life==
Zabka was born in New York City, the son of Nancy, a business liaison, producer, and production assistant, and Stan Zabka, a director, writer, and composer. Zabka has a brother and a sister. Stan is of Czech descent and was born in Des Moines, Iowa. He worked as production manager on many motion pictures, including the Chuck Norris film &quot;Forced Vengeance&quot; (1982).

In 1983, Zabka graduated from El Camino Real Charter High School in Los Angeles, California, before briefly attending California State University, Northridge and majoring in film.

==Career==
Zabka&#x27;s breakout acting role came in his first movie, &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; (1984). Zabka played Johnny Lawrence, the main antagonist to the title character and protagonist played by Ralph Macchio. At the time, Zabka had no training in karate, but was an accomplished wrestler. Participating in the film inspired Zabka to learn the martial art of Tang Soo Do and he later earned a seconddegree green belt.

Later in the 1980s, Zabka appeared in the comedy movies &quot;Just One of the Guys&quot; (1985) and &quot;Back to School&quot; (1986). He co-starred on the CBS television series &quot;The Equalizer&quot; as the son of the title character (198689). Zabka also played Jack, Audrey&#x27;s jock boyfriend, in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s European Vacation&quot; (1985). Zabka later tried to step away from playing the class bully character. In an interview, Zabka mentioned that he was sometimes hassled in public by random people due to the villainous characters he was best known for.

During the 1990s and 2000s, Zabka acted mostly in independent films while studying to be a filmmaker. In 2003, he wrote and produced the short film &quot;Most&quot; (aka &quot;The Bridge&quot;) shot on location in the Czech Republic and Poland. &quot;Most&quot; had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in 2003 and won numerous awards at prestigious film festivals, including Best of Festival at the Palm Springs International Festival of Short Films in 2003. In 2004, Zabka was nominated for an Academy Award for &quot;Most&quot; in the Live Action Short Film category.
In 2007, Zabka directed and starred in a music video for the band No More Kings&#x27; song, &quot;Sweep the Leg.&quot; The video stars Zabka as a caricature of himself, living in a trailer in the desert and obsessed with his role in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;. The video includes cameos by several of the original &quot;Karate Kid&quot; cast members, including Martin Kove and Ralph Macchio.

In 2010, Zabka directed Rascal Flatts in their music video for the song &quot;Why Wait&quot; and also directed the video for their 2017 hit &quot;Yours If You Want It.&quot; That same year, Zabka made a cameo appearance in the comedy movie &quot;Hot Tub Time Machine&quot;.

In 2013, Zabka and Macchio guest starred in the season 8 episode of &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, &quot;The Bro Mitzvah.&quot; Zabka also appeared in several episodes of the sitcom&#x27;s ninth season, playing a fictional version of himself. Zabka also directed commercials for clients including Little Tikes and Verizon at Heresy in Venice, California.

On August 4, 2017, it was announced that Zabka would reprise his role as Johnny Lawrence in a 10-episode &quot;Karate Kid&quot; revival series for YouTube Red titled &quot;Cobra Kai&quot; that debuted in 2018. Zabka also co-executive produces the series with Ralph Macchio. The series begins 33 years after the events of the first film, and revolves around a down and out Johnny who, seeking to rebuild his life, reopens the Cobra Kai dojo. It reignites his rivalry with a now successful Daniel LaRusso (Macchio), who has been struggling to maintain balance in his life without the guidance of his now deceased mentor, Mr. Miyagi.

==Personal life==
Zabka married his wife, Stacie, in 2008 and they have two children.

<text>Gerrit Dou (; 7 April 1613 – 9 February 1675), also known as Gerard Douw or Dow, was a Dutch Golden Age painter, whose small, highly polished paintings are typical of the Leiden fijnschilders. He specialised in genre scenes and is noted for his &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; &quot;niche&quot; paintings and candlelit night-scenes with strong chiaroscuro. He was a student of Rembrandt.

==Life==

Dou was born in Leiden, where his father was a manufacturer of stained-glass. He studied drawing under Bartholomeus Dolendo, and then trained in the stained-glass workshop of Pieter Couwenhorn. In February 1628, at the age of fourteen, his father sent him to study painting in the studio of Rembrandt (then aged about 21) who lived nearby. From Rembrandt, with whom he remained for about three years, he acquired his skill in colouring and in the more subtle effects of chiaroscuro, and his master&#x27;s style is reflected in several of his earlier pictures, notably a self-portrait at the age of 22, around 1635–1638, in the Bridgewater Collection, and in the &quot;Blind Tobit going to meet his Son&quot;, at Wardour Castle [locations may be outdated].
At a comparatively early point in his career, however, he developed a distinctive manner of his own which diverged considerably from Rembrandt&#x27;s, cultivating a minute and elaborate style of treatment. He is said to have spent five days in painting a hand, and his work was so fine that he found it necessary to manufacture his own brushes.
Notwithstanding the minuteness of his touch, the general effect was harmonious and free from stiffness, and his colour was always fresh and transparent. He often represented subjects in lantern or candle light, the effects of which he reproduced with an unparalleled fidelity and skill. He often painted with the aid of a concave lens combined with a convex mirror (the former sharpening perception, the latter providing a rightway-up image to paint from), and to obtain exactness looked at his subject through a frame crossed with squares of silk thread. His practice as a portrait painter, which was at first considerable, gradually declined, sitters being unwilling to give him the time that he deemed necessary. His pictures were always small in size. More than 200 are attributed to him, and examples are to be found in most of the major public collections of Europe. His &quot;chef-d&#x27;oeuvre&quot; is generally considered to be &quot;The Dropsical Woman&quot; (1663), and &quot;The Dutch Housewife&quot; (1650), both in the Louvre. The &quot;Evening School&quot;, in the Amsterdam Rijksmuseum, is the best example of the candlelight scenes in which he excelled. In the National Gallery, London, favorable specimens are to be seen in the &quot;Poulterer&#x27;s Shop&quot; (1672), and a self-portrait (see above). Dou&#x27;s pictures brought high prices, and one patron, Pieter Spiering, who acted as Swedish Ambassador in The Hague from the mid-1630s, paid him 500 guilders annually simply for the right of first refusal of his latest works. Queen Christina of Sweden owned eleven paintings by Dou, and Cosimo III de&#x27; Medici visited his house, where he may have bought at least one of the works now in the Uffizi. The Dutch royal court itself, however, preferred work of a more classical tendency.

Dou died in Leiden. His most noted pupils were Frans van Mieris the Elder and Gabriël Metsu. He also taught Bartholomeus Maton, Carel de Moor, Matthijs Naiveu, Abraham de Pape, Godfried Schalcken, Pieter Cornelisz van Slingelandt, Domenicus van Tol, Gijsbert Andriesz Verbrugge, and Pieter Hermansz Verelst.

==Interpretation==
A considerable amount was written about Dou in his own lifetime; for instance, Philips Angels praises Dou in his &quot;Lof der Schilderkunst&quot; for his imitation of nature and his visual illusions. Angels also stresses how Dou&#x27;s paintings expressed the paragone debate current around that time. The debate was an ongoing competition between painting, sculpture and poetry as to which was the best representation of nature. It was especially popular in Leiden where the painters were seeking to obtain the rights of a guild from the town council in order to have laws for their economic protection.

The paragone debate is not only addressed in writings from that time but is also reflected in the subject matter of several of Dou&#x27;s paintings. An example of this is the &quot;Old Painter at work&quot;, in which an old painter is shown working on a canvas behind a table displaying objects that show his capabilities of imitation. The aged painter refers to an argument in the paragone debate that a painter can achieve his best work at an old age, while a sculptor cannot because of the physical demands of sculpting. On the table, a sculptured head and a printed book are rendered in a lifelike fashion to show that painting can imitate both sculpture and printed paper, thereby reinforcing the notion that painting trumps sculpture. According to Sluijter, the &quot;amazing true-to-life peacock and a beautiful Triton shell, next to a copper pot with the most refined reflections of light&quot; show that art beats nature. Sluijter argues that the peacock stands for the ability of painting to &quot;preserve the transient works of nature thereby even surpassing it&quot;. [Sluijter, 2000]

Difficulties arise when an artist wants to associate a certain meaning with a specific object. One of the most troublesome and thus one of the most instructive objects in Dou&#x27;s oeuvre is a relief by François Duquesnoy called &quot;Putti Teasing a Goat&quot;. This relief features in many of Dou&#x27;s pictures with a window-sill motif, and has been assigned various meanings. J. A. Emmens, for example, states that in &quot;The Trumpeter&quot; the relief represents &quot;the deceitfulness of human desires, because the goat, personifying lust, can time and again be deceived by appearance, by the deceptive imitation, which is the mask&quot;. [Emmens, Opstellen, cit. (note 4), vol. 2, p 183 in Hecht, 2002]
&quot;The Kitchen Maid with a Boy in a Window&quot; features a maidservant, fish and a little boy holding a hare, cramped together with a bunch of vegetables, a dead bird and copperware. Sluijter acknowledges that a contemporary viewer would have certainly approved of this scene as representing an approximation of life since the rendering of all the material is very realistic. On the overall series of maidservant-scenes, Sluijter remarks that the image of a maidservant was generally associated with a sexual undertone. According to de Jongh, this motif has erotic references. In his article on Erotica in 17th-century genre pieces, de Jongh argues that dead hunted birds and animals most likely all refer to the notion of eroticism and availability of the woman depicted because birding and hunting were synonyms for sexual encounters. All images of maidservants accompanied by dead birds or animals refer to hunting and &quot;vogelen&quot; (birding), which in Dutch means to copulate. The maidservants are thereby explicitly erotic. Certainly, a cock as a bird refers to a cock as the male sex organ and this can be seen hanging from the wall in &quot;Kitchen Maid with a Boy in a Window&quot;. [de Jongh, 1968–1969] De Jongh´s erotic interpretations can be disputed regarding the paintings by Gerard Dou because he depicts his dead chicks and furry hares not only with seductive maidservants but also as props in motifs with old servants, or in domestic household scenes, such as &quot;The Young Mother&quot; (1658).


Additionally, to objects possibly having a deeper meaning via emblem books, complete scenes in Dou&#x27;s oeuvre have been related to scenes depicted in emblem books or prints. The &quot;Girl Pouring Water&quot; is a variation of the theme &quot;Educatio prima bona sit&quot; from Boissards &quot;Vesuntini emblemata&quot;. This emblem depicts the moral that &quot;children absorb knowledge like a pot absorbs water&quot;. The gaining of knowledge is represented by a little boy standing in the background while the water is poured in the foreground. [Hollander, 2002]

One painting that is strongly associated with an emblem is the &quot;Night School&quot;. This particular painting is rather anecdotal in character. Baer disagrees with Hecht who refers to this painting as being merely a demonstration of Dou&#x27;s abilities to work with artificial light. Baer identifies the candle lights with the light of understanding, and she relates the unlit lantern on the left wall with ignorance, which is combated by teaching, represented by the lit lantern in the middle of the floor. Additionally, Baer suggests that the girl at the left is a representation of Cognitione because she strikes the same pose as in Cesare Ripa&#x27;s &quot;Iconologia&quot;. Like Ripa&#x27;s emblem, the girl in Dou&#x27;s painting holds a candle while pointing towards a line of text. The essence of Ripa&#x27;s emblem is that &quot;like our eyes, which need light to see, so our reason needs our senses, especially that of sight, to achieve true understanding&quot;. [Baer, 2001]

==Posthumous reputation==
Dou&#x27;s work commanded high prices long after his death, until the 1860s. Soon after, he fell into near complete obscurity. For example, when the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York held in an exhibit to introduce Dutch art, it featured 37 by Rembrandt, 20 by Hals, but none by Dou. His obscurity continued until the 1970s when his reputation was reestablished and has continued since.

==Cultural references==
In Honoré de Balzac&#x27;s 1831 novel &quot;La Peau de chagrin&quot;, the curiosity shop Raphaël de Valentin enters in the opening sequence contains, among other paintings, &quot;a Gerald Dow which resembled a page of Sterne,&quot; and the old shopkeeper is compared to &quot;Gerald Dow&#x27;s &quot;Money-Changer&quot;.&quot;

In the comic opera &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, by Gilbert and Sullivan, the Major-General brags of being able to distinguish works by Raphael from works by Dou and Johan Zoffany.

Dou (as &quot;Gerard Douw&quot;) is a character in J. Sheridan Le Fanu&#x27;s short story &quot;Schalken the Painter&quot;. In the 1979 BBC television adaptation of this work, &quot;Schalcken the Painter&quot;, he was played by Maurice Denham.

Dou is portrayed on film by Toby Jones in &quot;Nightwatching&quot; (2007).

W. F. Harvey&#x27;s short story &quot;Old Masters&quot; features a picture by Dou (as Gerhard Dow) as the subject of an ingenious scam. (The story is included in the 2009 Wordsworth Edition omnibus collection of Harvey&#x27;s stories, &quot;The Beast with Five Fingers&quot;.)

A group of boys in Mary Mapes Dodge&#x27;s &quot;Hans Brinker or the Silver Skates&quot; visit a museum in Amsterdam and see two paintings by &quot;Gerard Douw&quot;, &quot;The Hermit&quot; and &quot;Evening School.&quot;

In the 2023 film, “The Little Mermaid” Dou’s painting, Astronomer by Candlelight, is featured as a page in a book which the mermaid, Ariel, flips though while singing “Part of Your World”.

<text>Luis is a given name. It is the Spanish form of the originally Germanic name or . Other Iberian Romance languages have comparable forms: &#x27; (with an accent mark on the i) in Portuguese and Galician, &#x27; in Aragonese and Catalan, while  is archaic in Portugal, but common in Brazil.

== Origins ==
The Germanic name (and its variants) is usually said to be composed of the words for &quot;fame&quot; () and &quot;warrior&quot; () and hence may be translated to &quot;famous warrior&quot; or &quot;famous in battle&quot;. According to Dutch onomatologists however, it is more likely that the first stem was , meaning fame, which would give the meaning &#x27;warrior for the gods&#x27; (or: &#x27;warrior who captured stability&#x27;) for the full name.

Modern forms of the name are the German name Ludwig and the Dutch form Lodewijk. and the other Iberian forms more closely resemble the French name Louis, a derivation of the Latinized form Clovis, known from the kings of the Franks. The sanctified French king Louis IX (Saint Louis) contributed much to the popularity of the name.

<text>Adam Baldwin (born February 27, 1962) is an American actor. He made his film debut in &quot;My Bodyguard&quot; (1980). He later appeared in &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; (1987) as Animal Mother, and in the television series &quot;Firefly&quot; and its continuation film &quot;Serenity&quot; as Jayne Cobb. His roles include Stillman in &quot;Ordinary People&quot; (1980), Colonel John Casey in &quot;Chuck&quot;, and Mike Slattery in &quot;The Last Ship&quot;.

==Early life==
Baldwin was born on February 27, 1962 in Winnetka, Illinois, and studied at New Trier Township High School in east Winnetka.

==Career==
Appearing in a large number of films since 1980, Baldwin rose to prominence as the troubled outcast Ricky Linderman in &quot;My Bodyguard&quot; (1980) and moved on to bigger roles in &quot;D.C. Cab&quot; (1983), &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; (1987), &quot;Next of Kin&quot; (1989), &quot;Predator 2&quot; (1990), &quot;Deadbolt&quot; (1992), &quot;Independence Day&quot; (1996), &quot;The Patriot&quot; (2000), and &quot;Serenity&quot; (2005)—in which he reprises his role as the mercenary Jayne Cobb from the television series &quot;Firefly.&quot;

His other work includes &quot;Radio Flyer&quot; (1992), &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; (1998), &quot;The X-Files&quot; (Knowle Rohrer), &quot;The Cape&quot;, &quot;Men in Black: The Series&quot;, &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;The Inside&quot;, &quot;NCIS&quot;, and the 2005 remake of &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;. He also starred in the ABC series &quot;Day Break&quot; as Chad Shelten in 2006.

Baldwin parodied Ricky Linderman in the 2008 film &quot;Drillbit Taylor&quot;. He is also known for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Chuck&quot;, in which he played John Casey, a hard-nosed Marine colonel working for the NSA.

In season four of &quot;Castle&quot;, Baldwin was reunited with former &quot;Firefly&quot; castmate Nathan Fillion. He played Detective Ethan Slaughter in the 21st episode called &quot;Headhunters&quot; which aired April 16, 2012. He returned to &quot;Castle&quot; in the eighth-season episode &quot;Cool Boys&quot;.

Baldwin won a SyFy Genre Award in 2006 for &quot;Best Supporting Actor/Television&quot; for his role as Jayne Cobb in the television series &quot;Firefly&quot;.

Baldwin was cast as Superman in &quot;&quot;, which is based on DC Comics&#x27; &quot;The Death of Superman&quot;. He also voices the character in the massively multiplayer online game &quot;DC Universe Online&quot;.

Baldwin has a role as a voice actor in the Xbox 360 games &quot;Halo 3&quot; and &quot;Halo 3: ODST&quot;, the latter putting him in the role of Corporal Taylor &quot;Dutch&quot; Miles. Baldwin also appears as a voice actor in &quot;Half-Life 2: Episode Two&quot; for various resistance soldiers and citizens. Along with his &quot;Chuck&quot; co-star, Yvonne Strahovski, he also appeared in &quot;Mass Effect 2&quot; as Marine squad leader Kal&#x27;Reegar.

==Personal life==
Baldwin has three children with his wife, Ami Julius.

He is a supporter of Ride 2 Recovery, a bike-riding organization set up for the rehabilitation of wounded veterans. He participated in the 2009 &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess With Texas Challenge&quot; bike ride.

In late 2015, Baldwin endorsed Ted Cruz for the 2016 United States presidential election via Twitter.

Baldwin has sometimes been credited with originating the hashtag #GamerGate near the end of August 2014 by posting the hashtag on Twitter alongside a pair of videos that, as part of wider criticisms, repeated earlier allegations against Zoë Quinn and Nathan Grayson. He later told an interviewer that &quot;leftists&quot; were imposing &quot;political crap&quot; on gamers.

<text>A commissariat is a department or organization commanded by a commissary or by a corps of commissaries.

In many countries, commissary is a police rank. In those countries, a commissariat is a police station commanded by a commissary.

In some armies, commissaries are logistic officers. In those countries, a commissariat is a department charged with the provision of supplies, both food and forage, for the troops. The supply of military stores such as ammunition is not included in the duties of a commissariat. In almost every army the duties of transport and supply are performed by the same corps of departmental troops.

==British Army==
===17th century===
When James II mustered an army on Hounslow Heath in 1685, he appointed a certain John Shales as Commissary General of provisions, responsible for sourcing, storing and issuing food for the troops and forage for the horses. In addition he was to license and regulate sutlers, to procure wagons, carriages, horses and drivers when required for transport and to account for all payments to the Lord High Treasurer and the Paymaster-General of His Majesty&#x27;s Forces. Following the Glorious Revolution of 1688, Shales was reappointed Commissary-General (though he was subsequently accused of mismanagement and replaced).

===18th century===
After 1694 the appointment lapsed, though it was reinstated subsequently from time to time on a more geographically-specific basis, for a particular expedition, theatre of war or colonial garrison. Otherwise, in the eighteenth century, arrangements for supply and transport tended to be devolved to individual regiments, who would work with a combination of civilian contractors and other agencies. The only centralized control at this time was that exercised by HM Treasury, which ultimately authorised expenditure. In 1793, however, with Britain at war with France, a Commissary-General for Britain was once again appointed and in 1797 a number of District Commissaries were engaged and made accountable to him: the beginnings of a more permanent Commissariat; his remit, however, was limited to the British mainland (and even there some areas, including barracks, were separately administered). Away from Britain&#x27;s shores, the army was provided for independently as before.

===19th century===
In 1809 things began to change with the appointment of a Commissary-in-chief to superintend both the home and foreign Commissariat services. The Commissariat was still a department of HM Treasury and its personnel were uniformed civilians (though they were subject to military discipline). It now supplied food, fuel and forage for all troops, as well as certain other equipment including barrack stores. The main items outside its remit were arms and ammunition, which were the responsibility of the Board of Ordnance. The Commissariat&#x27;s officers held ranks ranging from Commissary-General (equivalent to a Brigadier-General in the Army) to Deputy Assistant Commissary-General (equivalent to a Lieutenant) with Commissary Clerks akin to NCOs. Under the Treasury the Commissariat was organised into two branches: Stores and Accounts. Transport (albeit nominally a responsibility of the Stores Branch) was something of a poor relation; this in part led to the Commander-in-chief establishing a separate Royal Waggon Train.

After the end of the Napoleonic Wars the office of Commissary-in-chief was abolished and the Treasury moved to consolidate the department&#x27;s remit. In 1822 the Stores Branch (along with its warehouses and staff both at home and abroad) was transferred to the Board of Ordnance, which also took on responsibility for provision of food, forage and fuel to troops in England ten years later. Thereafter the Commissariat Department became principally a financial office: its fund (the Commissariat Chest) was used to provide a form of banking service for public services in the Colonies; in the words of a Treasury memorandum laid before Parliament in 1841: Provision of food, forage and fuel for the army abroad remained a (albeit secondary) responsibility of the Commissariat at this time.

In its much reduced form, the Commissariat infamously struggled to deal with the complexities of supplying the Army during Crimean War; in December 1854 control of the military functions of the Commissariat were transferred to the War Office. The Commissariat remained a uniformed civilian service until 1869, when its officers transferred to the new Control Department as commissioned Army officers. The supply organization of the British Army then went through a number of incarnations, including the Commissariat and Transport Department, Staff and Corps, before becoming the Army Service Corps in 1888.

====In popular culture====
In the &quot;Major General&#x27;s Song&quot; in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; by Gilbert and Sullivan, the Major-General boasts that when, among many other bits and pieces of seemingly elementary or irrelevant information, he &quot;know(s) precisely what is meant by commissariat&quot;, he will be the best officer the army has ever seen (satirizing 19th century British officers&#x27; lack of concrete military knowledge). That line can perhaps also be read in a second and very different way; since that work was first performed in 1878, when the Army&#x27;s Commissariat was at the height of change, as outlined in the paragraph above, the suggestion that the Major-General did not know precisely what the term meant may perhaps have been also a very pointed satirical allusion to that rapidly changing situation.

== Penal colonies in Australia ==
In the penal colonies of New South Wales and Van Dieman&#x27;s Land (now Tasmania), the Commissariat Department also had responsibility for the needs of convicts and, in the early days, provisions sold by storekeepers, as well as for military garrisons and naval victualing. This practice dated from the inception of the colony in 1788, before the colony was self-sufficient in food production. The Governors of the colonies were military men, and the administration of stores was performed by commissary officers. After 1855, the Commissariat Department only had responsibility for the provisions of military forces, the few remaining convicts, and lunatics. It was abolished, in New South Wales, in 1870 when the last British military forces departed. Similar arrangements applied in the Moreton Bay penal colony (originally part of New South Wales) and Western Australia.

==Soviet Army and modern Russian Army==
Military commissariats of the Soviet Army and modern Russian Army is а local military administrative agency that prepares and executes plans for military mobilization, maintains records on military manpower and economic resources available to the armed forces, provides pre-military training, drafts men for military service, organizes reserves for training, and performs other military functions at the local level.

==Religious usage==

=== Roman Catholic ===
Among Roman Catholic religious orders, the term &quot;Commissariat&quot; refers to a division of the Order which is a semi-autonomous body. It is considered less viable than a full Province, but with potential to develop into such, or it serves a group within the Order who are best served separately than in a Province into which they would otherwise be forced, e.g., due to language divisions. As with military usage, the Religious Superior of the division is referred to as the Commissary. The term is most commonly used among Franciscan Orders.

=== Zoroastrians ===
The term is also used among Indian Zoroastrians.

<doc id="755932" wikidata="Q445980" url="?curid=755932" title="Manuel Lujan Jr.">
<text>Manuel Archibald Lujan Jr. (May 12, 1928 – April 25, 2019) was an American politician from New Mexico who sat in the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican from 1969 to 1989 and was the United States secretary of the interior from 1989 to 1993. He was a colleague of George H. W. Bush in the House from 1969 to 1971. In 1989, President Bush named Lujan to his cabinet.

==Early life and education==
Lujan was born in San Ildefonso Pueblo, New Mexico, into the family of Manuel A. Lujan Sr. and Lorenzita (née Romero) Lujan. His father was mayor of Santa Fe and was an unsuccessful candidate for governor and congress. Lujan attended Catholic schools in Santa Fe. He attended Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California in 1946 and graduated from the St. Michael&#x27;s College in Santa Fe in 1950.

== Career ==
After college, Lujan went to work for the family insurance company, the Manuel Lujan Agencies, which his father had opened in 1925. The Albuquerque-based company remains a leading risk management and insurance firm and, in 2002, it was ranked as the most profitable of New Mexico&#x27;s Hispanic-owned businesses.

Lujan also followed his father into politics, launching his first campaign with a failed bid for the New Mexico State Senate in 1964. Three years later, he helped to found the Republican National Hispanic Assembly. Lujan&#x27;s failed 1964 bid for political office was his last electoral defeat; after defeating the incumbent Rep. Thomas G. Morris in 1968, he sat in Congress for the next two decades.

==Congress==
Throughout the 1970s, Lujan was re-elected and built a reputation as a low-key, personable backbencher. His legislative interests were largely in line with the western U.S. states&#x27; priorities of the time, including Indian affairs, nuclear power expansion and the opening of federal lands to commerce and recreation. In 1978, he was the first Hispanic Republican to join the recently formed Congressional Hispanic Caucus.

The 1980s brought new challenges and new prominence for Lujan. He nearly lost his seat in 1980 to an unexpectedly strong challenge from the Democrat Bill Richardson. In the reapportionment that followed, Lujan&#x27;s district was significantly altered after New Mexico gained a third district. The old 1st was a largely rural district that included the northeastern portion of the state, including most of Albuquerque. The new 1st was a much more compact and urban district that included three-quarters of Albuquerque.

Due to the new demographics of his district, Lujan stood down as ranking Republican of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee and became ranking Republican of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee.

In addition to his congressional duties, Lujan represented New Mexico as a delegate to every Republican National Convention from 1972 to 2004. In 1980, he was a featured speaker at the convention on the night delegates met to nominate a vice presidential candidate.

==Secretary of the Interior (1989–1993)==
Beginning with Ronald Reagan&#x27;s inauguration in 1981, Lujan was often mentioned as a potential nominee for interior secretary. Along with Dick Cheney, he was one of the top contenders to replace James G. Watt following his resignation, although the position eventually went to William Clark.

When the Bush transition team approached Lujan about the job in late 1988, he declined to accept it, but changed his mind only after a personal appeal from the president-elect. After the tenure of James Watt and Donald Hodel, Lujan was widely regarded as a moderate at the time of his unanimous confirmation in February 1989. His nomination faced little opposition, although some environmental groups criticized his congressional voting record (the League of Conservation Voters gave Lujan a 23 percent career rating).

===Early tenure===
Just months into his term, Lujan came under criticism from conservationists and the media for his hands-off approach to policy and his gaffe-prone speeches. In one oft-quoted error, he told a reporter that the federal government received royalty payments for certain mineral rights, only to later admit &quot;I didn&#x27;t know what I was talking about.&quot;

===Offshore oil drilling===
As the chairman of a White House task force studying offshore oil drilling, Lujan expressed his strong support for drilling off the California coast in a speech to western governors. 19 members of the California congressional delegation — all Democrats — and Republican Governor Pete Wilson called for Lujan to resign from the study group because he was prejudiced to one point of view but Lujan declined to step down.

As the administration point man on offshore drilling, he opposed Democratic efforts to halt the practice after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in April 1989.

===Endangered Species Act===
Although Lujan gained more respect throughout his term, he remained a lightning rod for environmentalists. In a 1990 interview, he described the Endangered Species Act as &quot;too tough&quot;, and said it may not be necessary to &quot;save every subspecies&quot;. The Bush administration distanced itself from Lujan&#x27;s position at a time when newspapers had just begun to write about the interior secretary&#x27;s rebound from earlier public relations woes.

===1992–1993===
Other notable events of Lujan&#x27;s term included frequent debates over the spotted owl, the construction of the Washington Commanders NFL football team stadium on federal property in Washington, D.C., and the increased regulation of Indian casinos. Lujan generally won praise for his handling of Indian affairs, an interest he had pursued earlier while in Congress.

After leaving the Interior Department at the end of Bush&#x27;s term, Lujan characterized his job as one of constant tensions. &quot;No one is satisfied. If you do something that&#x27;s pro-development, you get the environmental groups against you, and if you do something that&#x27;s pro-environmental you get the industry groups after you,&quot; Lujan said in a May 9, 1993, Associated Press report. &quot;What I tried to do — and I think I was successful in doing — was to bring a balance between the use of resources on public lands and environmental concerns.&quot;

==Post-Washington days==
In the waning months of his term, Lujan was frequently named as a likely candidate for Governor of New Mexico in 1994. He squelched the rumors, saying he was &quot;through running.&quot;

After leaving office, Lujan worked as a lobbyist and a public speaker. In 2004, he launched the Hispanic Alliance for Progress Institute, a conservative think-tank focusing on economic and &quot;family values&quot; issues from a Hispanic perspective.

Lujan&#x27;s tenure at the Interior Department has since been commemorated with an award in his honor. Each year, the department presents the &quot;Manuel Lujan Jr. Champion Award&quot; to employees who exhibit &quot;outstanding work in carrying out the department&#x27;s mission&quot;. In addition, the department and its Bureau of Indian Affairs honored Lujan by dedicating the BIA&#x27;s administrative building in Albuquerque with Lujan&#x27;s name.

Lujan&#x27;s brother Edward (b. 1931) was the New Mexico Republican Party chairman for many years and was a major influence in the development of the National Hispanic Cultural Center.

==Personal life==
Lujan died of heart failure on April 25, 2019, in Albuquerque.

<doc id="755936" wikidata="Q6597639" url="?curid=755936" title="Robert Ferrers of Wem">
<text>Robert Ferrers of Wem (c. 1373 – bef. 29 November 1396) was an English aristocrat. He was born in Willisham, Suffolk.

Robert was the son of Baron Sir Robert Ferrers of Wem and Elizabeth Boteler, 4th Baroness Boteler of Wem, who died in June 1411, and paternal grandson of Robert de Ferrers, 3rd Baron Ferrers of Chartley. 

His father had been summoned to Parliament in 1375 as Robert Ferrers of Wem. Under modern peerage doctrine the manner in which he was named in this summons would be viewed as creating a novel peerage, the Barons Ferrers of Wem, to which his son Robert, who was never himself summoned, would be viewed to have succeeded as 2nd Baron on his father&#x27;s death in 1380. 

However, in &quot;Complete Peerage&quot;, Vicary Gibbs argues that contemporary practice was not so regimented as it would become, and that the elder Robert had clearly been summoned simply as possessor, &quot;jure uxoris&quot;, of the same barony previously held by his father-in-law William, Baron Boteler of Wem. His mother&#x27;s 3rd husband, Sir Thomas Molinton, would in turn in his will style himself &#x27;Lord of Wemme&#x27;, &quot;jure uxoris&quot;, though he was never summoned. Were it the case that his father was summoned only &quot;jure uxoris&quot;, then Elizabeth&#x27;s son Robert Ferrers, who was never himself summoned, would not have been a peer as he predeceased his mother. 

Following this Robert&#x27;s death in 1396 and of his mother in 1411, the Barony Boteler of Wem and any Barony Ferrers that might be held to have been created by the 1375 summons would have gone into abeyance between his two daughters.

==Family==
Robert Ferrers married Joan Beaufort in 1391 at Beaufort-en-Vallée, formerly known as Mayenne-et-Loire, Anjou. They had two daughters:
* Elizabeth (1393–1434). She is buried at Black Friars Church, York. She married John de Greystoke, 4th Baron Greystoke (1389–1436) on 28 October 1407 in Greystoke Castle, Greystoke, Cumberland, and had issue.
* Mary or Margery (1394 – 25 January 1457/1458). She married her stepbrother, Sir Ralph Neville, son of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmoreland, before 1411 in Oversley, Warwickshire and had issue.

<doc id="755939" wikidata="Q261366" url="?curid=755939" title="Shams al-Muluk Duqaq">
<text>Abu Nasr Shams al-Muluk Duqaq (died 8 June 1104) was the Seljuq ruler of Damascus from 1095 to 1104.

==Reign==
Duqaq was a son of the Seljuq ruler of Syria, Tutush I, and Safwat al-Mulk Khatun. He was the brother of Ridwan. When their father died in 1095, Ridwan claimed Syria for himself, and Duqaq initially inherited territory in the Jezirah and lived with his brother in Aleppo. However, he soon rebelled and seized control of Damascus, throwing Syria into near anarchy and civil war. Duqaq had the support of Yaghi-Siyan of Antioch, who had no quarrel with Ridwan but disliked his atabeg Janah ad-Dawla; joining Yaghi-Siyan and Duqaq was Ilghazi, governor of Jerusalem. Ridwan allied with Ilghazi&#x27;s brother Sökmen of Artukids.

Radwan attacked Yaghi-Siyan, and when Duqaq and Ilghazi came to assist him, Ridwan besieged Damascus as well. However, Ridwan soon quarrelled with Janah ad-Dawla, who captured Homs from him, and with his atabeg out of the alliance, Yaghi-Siyan was much more willing to assist him. This new alliance was sealed with a marriage between Ridwan and Yaghi-Siyan&#x27;s daughter. The two were about to attack Shaizar when they heard of the arrival of the First Crusade; all the various alliances were disbanded and everyone returned to their own cities, though if any of the alliances had remained intact, or they had all worked together, they would likely have been able to prevent the success of the crusade.

Over the winter of 1097–1098, during the siege of Antioch by the Crusaders, Yaghi-Siyan and his son Shams ad-Dawla sought help from Duqaq. On December 30, 1097, reinforcements from Duqaq were defeated by the foraging party of Bohemund of Taranto, and Duqaq retreated to Homs. Duqaq later joined Kerbogha of Mosul to attack the crusaders after they had occupied Antioch in June 1098, but during the battle, Duqaq&#x27;s line deserted and Kerbogha was defeated. While occupied in Syria, Duqaq&#x27;s possessions in the Jezirah were seized by some rebellious vassals; in 1099 he recaptured Diyarbakr.
In 1100, Duqaq ambushed Baldwin I of Edessa at Nahr al-Kalb, outside Beirut, while the latter was on his way to Jerusalem to succeed his brother Godfrey of Bouillon as king. Baldwin&#x27;s men held a narrow pass and Duqaq&#x27;s troops were not able to break through. Baldwin was victorious and continued on to Jerusalem.

In 1103, Duqaq captured Homs when Janah ad-Dawla, Ridwan&#x27;s former atabeg, was assassinated. Duqaq fell sick in 1104, and on the advice of his mother, appointed his own atabeg Toghtekin as atabeg to his young son Tutush II. Duqaq died on June 8 of that year. Toghtegin soon overthrew Duqaq&#x27;s dynasty to establish the Burid dynasty, which would rule Damascus for the next half-century.

<text>A mamelon () is a French name for a breast shaped hillock. At the Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855) during the Crimean War the French called a strategic hillock (location: ) the Mamelon. The British adopted the French name for the hill, but also called it &quot;Gordon&#x27;s Hill&quot;.

In October 1854 the French attempted to capture the summit of the hillock with a &quot;coup de main&quot; but were repulsed with casualties of about 600 officers and men. During the winter of 1854/55 the Russians built the Kamtschatka Redoubt on the summit of the Mamelon as part of a comprehensive defensive ring of double and in some parts triple lines of continuous defensive works around Sevastopol. During the campaign season of 1855, after two more failed attempts, and following a heavy bombardment and the capture of the outlying defences, the Kamtschatka Redoubt was stormed and captured by the French in early June. During the final assault, the British took some of the outlying works and suffered casualties of 30 officers and 350 other ranks; the French in the main assault deployed many more men and suffered about three times the British casualties.

==Cultural references==
The word appears in the &quot;Major-General&#x27;s Song&quot; from Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s 1879 comic opera, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, in which Major-General Stanley sings, &quot;... In fact, when I know what is meant by mamelon and ravelin ...&quot;

The ravelin is the oldest and at the same time the most important outer work of the bastion fortification system. It originated from small forts that were supposed to cover the bridge that led across the moat to the city or fortress gate from a direct attack. From this original function, to protect the gate bridge, also comes its original Italian name &quot;rivellino&quot; (which means small bank work or with the German expression common for it: &quot;Brückenkopf&quot; – &quot;bridge head&quot;). Therefore, the ravelin was at first only a small work, which should only make the access to the bridge in front of the fortress gates more difficult. 
When it was realized in the 16th century that this would generally provide better protection for the courtine, ravelins were also built in front of other courtines and these were gradually enlarged. However, it was not until the German fortress builder Daniel Specklin (1536–1589) recognized the principal importance of ravelins (which he still called &quot;ledige Wehr&quot; or &quot;revelin&quot;). He demanded that they be made as large as possible so that they fully covered the courtine and the flanks of the bastions and could place a flanking fire in front of the bastion tops. In the following period, ravelins can be found in practically all fortresses built according to the bastion fortification system. 

The outer edges of the ravelin are so configured that it divides an assault force, and guns in the ravelin can fire upon the attacking troops as they approach the curtain wall. It also impedes besiegers from using their artillery to batter a breach in the curtain wall. The side of the ravelin facing the inner fortifications has at best a low wall, if any, so as not to shelter attacking forces if they have overwhelmed it or the defenders have abandoned it. Frequently ravelins have a ramp or stairs on the curtain-wall side to facilitate the movement of troops and artillery onto the ravelin.

The first example of a ravelin appears in the fortifications of the Italian town of Sarzanello, and dates from 1497. The first ravelins were built of brick, but later, during the sixteenth century in the Netherlands, they were earthen (perhaps faced by stone or brick), the better to absorb the impact of cannonballs. The Italian origins of the system of fortifications (the star forts) of which ravelins were a part gave rise to the term &quot;trace Italienne&quot;. 

The French 17th-century military engineer Vauban made great use of ravelins in his design of fortifications for Louis XIV, and his ideas were still being used in 1761 by Major William Green at Gibraltar.

<doc id="755962" wikidata="Q2395286" url="?curid=755962" title="Toby Riddle">
<text>Toby &quot;Winema&quot; Riddle (born ; c. 1848 – 1920) was a Modoc woman who served as an interpreter in negotiations between the Native American Modoc tribe and the United States Army during the Modoc War (also called the Lava Beds War). She warned the peace commission of a possible Modoc attack, and she saved the life of the chairman Alfred B. Meacham when the 1873 attack took place.

She and her family toured with Meacham after the war, starring in his lecture-play &quot;Tragedy of the Lava Beds&quot;, to inform American people about the war. Meacham later published a book about Winema, which he dedicated to her. In 1891 Toby Riddle was one of the few Native American women to be awarded a military pension by the United States Congress, for her heroic actions during the peace negotiations in 1873. (Her first name also appears spelled as &quot;Tobey&quot; in historical records.)

==Early life and education==
She was born Nannookdoowah, which means &quot;strange child,&quot; as she was born with red-tinted hair. As a girl, she was named Winema&quot;,&quot; (woman chief) after rescuing some playmates from being caught in cascades in their canoe. As a young woman, she was said to have ridden with raiding parties of men to gather horses from enemy camps. Winema was a cousin of Kintpuash (also known as Captain Jack), the leader of the Modoc tribe at the time of the Modoc War.

==Marriage and family==
Winema married Frank Riddle, a white settler who had emigrated from Kentucky to California during the California Gold Rush. They settled near her family in the Lost River area and had a son, &quot;Charka&quot; (&quot;the handsome one&quot;). They also named him Jefferson C. Davis Riddle, in honor of the Army general Jefferson C. Davis who ended the Modoc War.

==Interpreters==
Winema Riddle was one of several Modoc who learned English, and her husband Frank had learned her language. They both served as interpreters before and during negotiations related to the creation of the Klamath Reservation.

They served as interpreters again to the peace commission appointed in 1873 to settle the Modoc War. During the 1873 negotiations, sometimes Winema carried messages between General Edward Canby and Kintpuash&quot;;&quot; as a woman, she was considered peaceful. After taking a message to Captain Jack&#x27;s Stronghold to schedule a peace talk, Winema learned of a Modoc plot to assassinate Canby. She warned the peace commission, but they went on as planned with the meeting. Canby and Thomas were killed by Modoc, and other peace commissioners and staff were wounded. Toby Riddle was there and saved Alfred B. Meacham from being scalped and killed.

Afterward the US Army, commanded by General Jefferson C. Davis, finally captured Captain Jack and other Modoc leaders. They were tried and convicted before a US military court, and Captain Jack and three others were executed. 153 members of the band were removed as prisoners of war to Indian Territory in present-day Oklahoma. Some other Modoc, including the Riddle family, returned to the Klamath Reservation.

Meacham continued to champion Native American rights. He wrote a lecture-play &quot;Tragedy of the Lava Beds&quot;, starring Winema, Frank, and their son Jeff, and toured with them and Klamath representatives across the country for the next two years. They reached New York before returning to make their home in Oregon. Meacham said that &quot;Wi-ne-ma&quot; was popular with audiences, as she had worked for peace between the peoples. He also published a book about Winema in 1876 and dedicated it to her:

This book is written with the avowed purpose of doing honor to the heroic Wi-ne-ma who at the peril of her life sought to save the ill fated peace commission to the Modoc Indians in 1873. The woman to whom the writer is indebted, under God, for saving his life.

Meacham wrote, the name of

Winema has taken its place beside those of Sara Winnimucca and Sacajawea in the annals of the early west. The personal daring of these Indian Women and the roles they played as negotiators between their people and the palefaces have lifted them above considerations of race into the ranks of the great women of all time.

Because of her heroic role in trying to save the peace commissioners during the 1873 talks, Meacham petitioned Congress to award Riddle a military pension. In 1891 the US Congress authorized a military pension for Toby Riddle of $25 per month, which she received until her death in 1920. Toby and Frank&#x27;s son Jeff C. Riddle wrote his own account of the Modoc War, to give the Indian perspective, which he published in 1914.

Toby attended the Centennial Exposition of 1876 in Philadelphia, and the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915. In later years, Riddle lived at Yainax Butte, Oregon, on the Klamath Reservation. Many of the Riddle descendants continue to live in the area of the Klamath Reservation.

==Legacy and honors==
* Winema Riddle was one of the few Native American women to be honored by the US Congress authorizing a military pension for her because of her heroism.
* Several regional landmarks are named &quot;Winema&quot; in her honor, including the Winema National Forest.

<doc id="755970" wikidata="Q918971" url="?curid=755970" title="Fakhr al-Mulk Ridwan">
<text>Ridwan ( – 10 December 1113) was a Seljuk emir of Aleppo from 1095 until his death.

Ridwan was born to the Seljuk prince Tutush, who had established a principality in Syria after his brother, Sultan Malik-Shah I granted him the region and its adjacent areas as an appanage. After the death of Malik-Shah, Tutush claimed the Seljuk crown, but he was killed by the forces of his nephew Berkyaruq near Ray, Iran. Following this, Ridwan moved to Aleppo and proclaimed himself the new emir. His brother Duqaq&#x27;s declaration of a new emirate in Damascus split the Syrian Seljuk state in two and started a rivalry between the brothers which continued even after the arrival of the First Crusade in 1097. Ridwan tried to banish the Crusaders with gold, and fought the Principality of Antioch, a Crusader state established after the end of the Siege of Antioch in 1098. Bohemond I of Antioch invaded Ridwan&#x27;s domain and reached Aleppo&#x27;s surroundings. Bohemond&#x27;s successor, Tancred, regent of Antioch, also warred against Ridwan, but the two later allied in a conflict against the emir of Mosul, Jawali Saqawa, supported by Baldwin II of Edessa and Joscelin I, the Lord of Turbessel.

Ridwan&#x27;s personality was shrouded in mystery. He was surrounded by the Shia Arabs of Aleppo and favoured the Nizari Isma&#x27;ilis. Ridwan became a patron of the Assassins, giving them the freedom to practice and propagate their religion by letting them establish a Mission House (dar al-dawah) in Aleppo and use the city as a base for future activities, which allowed the Assassins to establish a foothold in Syria. Ridwan had two of his brothers strangled to death, and had alleged ties to the assassination of several of his rivals, including the atabeg Janah ad-Dawla al-Husain. Ridwan&#x27;s death in 1113 caused an anti-Isma&#x27;ili reaction within Aleppo. The administrative sovereignty of the atabeg Lu&#x27;lu&#x27; al-Yaya, and the effective elimination of the Assassins in Aleppo, characterized the reign of his successor, Alp Arslan al-Akhras. Seljuk rule in Aleppo soon ended in 1118 with the Artuqid takeover by Ilghazi.

== Background==
Fakhr al-Mulk Ridwan was born around 1077. He was the eldest of five sons of Taj ad-Dawla Tutush, the brother of the Seljuk Sultan Malik-Shah I, and the mayor of Ganja in Arran. In 1078, Malik-Shah sent Tutush to conquer Syria and the adjacent areas as an appanage, creating a principality there. Tutush besieged and conquered Aleppo the next year, while a Fatimid army simultaneously besieged Damascus. Thereupon, the Turcoman ruler of Damascus, Atsiz ibn Uwaq () asked for help from Tutush. Having heard that Tutush was coming, the Fatimid forces retreated. Even though Atsiz accepted Tutush&#x27;s suzerainty, Tutush had Atsiz strangled with the bowstring of his bow on the pretext that he was late to greet him and that he was conspiring against him with his brother. Tutush conquered Southern Syria and Palestine, capturing Jerusalem, Damascus, Acre, Tyre, Tripoli, Jaffa, and Arish, as well as the region of Galilee, previously held by Atsiz, and founded the Syrian Seljuk State.

Tutush struggled with the Seljuk Sultan of Rum, Suleiman ibn Qutalmish (), who had claimed Aleppo. Qutalmish was defeated and killed in a battle that took place near Aleppo on 4 June 1086. Sultan Malik-Shah died in November 1092, though there were no princes of age to inherit the vast Seljuk empire. Tutush claimed the Seljuk throne, as he was the only adult, though he gained little support from the Turkic elite. He then captured Mosul, Aleppo and the Diyar Bakr. One of Malik-Shah&#x27;s wives, Terken Khatun, who was trying to install her four-year-old son Mahmud to the throne, then tried to reach out to Tutush but died suddenly in 1094. By 1094, Tutush, accompanied by his son, Shams al-Muluk Duqaq, had invaded the Jazira and western Iran, seizing the city of Ray. However, his nephew Berkyaruq&#x27;s forces killed him near the same city on 25 February 1095.

== Reign ==

=== Ridwan&#x27;s rivalry with Duqaq ===
Ridwan learned of his father&#x27;s death while he was camping in Anah and returned immediately to Aleppo and took over the Syrian Seljuk throne. The Turcoman ruler of Antioch, Yaghi-Siyan, gave his daughter to Ridwan in marriage and recognised Ridwan as his overlord, with coins being struck in his name in the city. Ridwan, fearing that they might gain power and overthrow him, strangled his two brothers, Abu Talib and Behram, while his other brother, Duqaq, accompanied by the atabeg Janah ad-Dawla al-Husain, sneaked out of Aleppo and moved to Damascus, founding a separate state there. Ridwan did not recognise Duqaq&#x27;s domain and proclaimed himself the sole legitimate ruler of the Syrian Seljuks. Thereupon, Ridwan besieged Damascus but failed to seize it and had to return to Aleppo. Thus, the Syrian Seljuk state was divided into two rival halves, ruled from Aleppo and Damascus.

In 1096, Ridwan wished to expand his domain and besieged Suruç, which was ruled at the time by his cousin, Soqman ibn Ortoq. He failed to seize the town. Later, he marched on Edessa and conquered the city. He also planned to capture Harran, but gave up because of unrest among his commanders. Ridwan then captured Turbessel after eliminating Yusuf ibn Abaq, one of the commanders who had disobeyed him. He moved to besiege Damascus again when Duqaq was out of the city, but then lifted the siege when he was informed of Duqaq&#x27;s approaching army and returned to Aleppo. Ridwan besieged Damascus again in the same year, but was again thwarted. Duqaq then launched raids against the territory of Aleppo, but Ridwan defeated him on 22 March 1097 at Qinnasrin. Taking advantage of the Syrian Seljuk split, the Fatimid vizier, al-Afdal Shahanshah, promised military support to Ridwan against his brother if he pledged allegiance to the Fatimid caliph al-Musta&#x27;li by having the Friday sermon read in his name. Ridwan agreed to this on 28 August 1097 but was met with harsh reactions among the Sunni leaders. A month later, Ridwan reverted to having the sermon read on behalf of the Sunni Abbasid caliph and the Seljuk sultan, also apologizing to the Abbasid caliph al-Mustazhir.

=== Crusades and Isma&#x27;ilism ===
Ridwan prepared to attack Duqaq and Janah ad-Dawla, who had established an independent emirate in Homs. Meanwhile, the Crusaders marched on Antioch, and the city&#x27;s governor, Yaghi-Siyan, who was disloyal to Ridwan and had openly intrigued with his rivals—his brother Duqaq and Kerbogha, the Turcoman Atabeg of Mosul—asked for help from the Muslim leaders, including the Seljuk Sultan Berkyaruq. Ridwan was not keen to help and sent only a small unit to the aid of the Muslim coalition led by Kerbogha, the Turcoman emir of Mosul. Ridwan did not participate in their expeditions, though his brother Duqaq and the atabeg Janah ad-Dawla did. Yaghi-Siyan left Ridwan&#x27;s side because of his behaviour, but then was forced to return to him after Duqaq failed him. Duqaq later feared that moving troops into Aleppo&#x27;s environs would allow Ridwan to strike at his domain. Ridwan, accompanied by Soqman ibn Ortoq, led an army to relieve Antioch. They retook Harem, but as they approached Antioch, the crusaders under the command of Bohemond of Taranto sent out all of their cavalry to lure the larger Turcoman forces to his desired battlefield—a narrow strip of land wedged between the Orontes River and Lake Antioch. Ridwan was defeated in the Battle of the Lake of Antioch, and his forces retreated, while the Crusaders reoccupied Harem. The Crusaders captured Antioch in June 1098 and established a principality there with Bohemond as its ruler. They then seized al-Bara and Ma&#x27;arrat al-Nu&#x27;man, and captured Zardana, Sarmeen and Kella, surrounding Aleppo. Bohemond defeated Ridwan again on 5 July 1100. While Bohemond was closing on Aleppo, the Armenian ruler of Melitene, Gabriel, asked for his help against the Danishmendid ruler Gazi Gümüshtigin. Ridwan used this opportunity to seize supplies stored by the Crusaders.

Meanwhile, Ridwan made peace with Janah ad-Dawla in Nukrah. Despite this, on 1 May 1103, Janah ad-Dawla was stabbed to death in Homs by three Persian Assassins dressed as Sufis, acting on a signal from a sheikh who accompanied them. Janah ad-Dawla&#x27;s officers and the assassins were killed during the ensuing chaos, and most of Homs&#x27; Turkish population fled to Damascus, while the city itself was annexed into Duqaq&#x27;s domain. Most sources suggest Ridwan initiated the assassination of Janah ad-Dawla. Ridwan, residing in the Citadel of Aleppo, had favoured the Shi&#x27;a, who comprised an important part of Aleppo&#x27;s population, hoping to win their support. Prior to this incident, Ridwan gave freedom to the Assassins to practice and propagate their religion, letting them establish a &quot;house of propaganda&quot; in Aleppo and using the city as a base for future activities. The Assassins thus gained a foothold in Syria. Despite this, Ridwan&#x27;s adherence to the Assassins&#x27; Nizari Isma&#x27;ili creed is uncertain, and according to historian Bernard Lewis, was unlikely.

=== Conflicts and alliance with Tancred ===
In general, Ridwan tried to banish the Crusaders with gold, despite being characterised as a &quot;rapacious miser&quot; among the Shia and Sunni Muslims in his domain. The regent of Antioch, Tancred, who forcibly collected money from the rural locals, made peace with Ridwan, in return receiving 7000 gold dinars and 10,000 cattle and sheep. Ridwan profited from Soqman ibn Ortoq&#x27;s victory over the Crusaders in the Battle of Harran in 1104 and took back the cities and fortresses occupied by the Crusaders. Ridwan&#x27;s brother and rival, Duqaq, died of tuberculosis on 6 June 1104, after which Ridwan moved to Damascus and gave &quot;khutbah&quot; in his own name, though Duqaq was succeeded by his son, Tutush II. Soon after, Tutush II and his relatives were set aside by his atabeg, Toghtekin, and the Turkish Burid dynasty succeeded the Seljuks in Damascus.

In 1105, Ridwan left Aleppo to aid the qadi of Tripoli, Fakhr al-Mulk ibn Ammar, against the Crusaders, but when he learned Tancred had besieged Artah, he turned back to relieve the town. Tancred offered peace to Ridwan. He refused it and was defeated on 20 April 1105 in the Battle of Artah, after which Tancred invaded and plundered the surroundings of Aleppo. Later, the pro-Fatimid emir of Apamea, Khalaf ibn Mula&#x27;ib, was assassinated and Ridwan added the town to his domain, though he lost it to Tancred in 1106. These events prompted Ridwan to ally with Ilghazi against, Jikirmish, the emir of Mosul, in besieging Nussaybin. Moreover, the new emir of Mosul, Chavli Saqaveh, joined this alliance against Kilij Arslan I, the Seljuk Sultan of Rûm, who had occupied Mosul. Ridwan and Chavli defeated and killed Kilij Arslan in 1107. While Chavli&#x27;s behaviour had disturbed Ridwan, the Seljuk Sultan and Ridwan&#x27;s uncle Muhammad I Tapar, dismissed Chavli. Not accepting this decision, he allied with local emirs and marched towards Syria. Ridwan first seized the ransom sent to Chavli by Baldwin II of Edessa in Siffin, and cooperated with the Numayrids against him, while Chavli occupied Balis. Thereupon, Ridwan allied with Tancred against Chavli, who also sought help from Baldwin and Joscelin I, the Lord of Turbessel. Ridwan&#x27;s 600-strong cavalry and Tancred&#x27;s army of 1,500 knights and foot-soldiers engaged Chavli, Baldwin, and Joscelin&#x27;s force of two thousand men in Turbessel in September 1108, defeating them in a battle in which both sides suffered heavy casualties. As a result, Balis returned to Seljuk control.

While Tancred was in Edessa, Ridwan launched raids against Antioch to reclaim the lands surrounding Aleppo but retreated after learning of Tancred&#x27;s arrival. Ridwan&#x27;s situation worsened when Tancred attacked east of Aleppo in retaliation. Ridwan gave Tancred 20,000 dinars, and 10,000 horses, as well as two fortresses in the vicinity of Aleppo, and freed the captives he had taken during his raids, in exchange for peace. This agreement caused a famine around Aleppo, and Ridwan had to sell the lands from his own demesne to the locals at low prices. Furthermore, Ibn al-Khashshab, the Shi&#x27;a &quot;qadi&quot; and &quot;rais&quot; of Aleppo, organised a riot in the city when Tancred forced Ridwan to affix a cross in the Great Mosque of Aleppo. Tancred, who controlled the routes from Aleppo to the Mediterranean, had held Aleppan caravans to ransom, and was plundering Syria, especially Aleppo&#x27;s environs. Ridwan did not have enough resources to deal with Tancred by himself, so Ibn al-Khashshab proposed to send a delegation of Shia and Sunni notables, merchants and clerics to the Seljuk sultan Muhammad I in Baghdad. Ridwan agreed to do so. Muhammad I started expeditions against the Crusaders with the Emir of Mosul, Mawdud ibn Altuntash, first besieging Harran, and then Turbessel. Ridwan tried to profit from this by engaging in it as little as possible, though he then abandoned the Muslim coalition by buying a pardon from the Crusaders, angering his subjects and the Muslim rulers alike. Meanwhile, Ridwan asked Mawdud to lift his siege of Turbessel and come to his aid in Aleppo. However, Ridwan did not allow the Seljuk army inside the city and imprisoned Ibn al-Khashshab and his major supporters. Yet again, Ridwan did not join the Muslim expeditions, and the Seljuk army left Syria in August 1111 without fighting a single battle.

=== Last years ===
Ridwan&#x27;s financial situation worsened. His attempt to confiscate the goods of a merchant named Abu Harb Isa from Khorasan, in cooperation with the Isma&#x27;ilis, greatly damaged his reputation. When the atabeg Toghtekin came to lead the Muslim armies against Sidon or Tripoli, he passed by Damascus, where Ridwan tried to assassinate him, but dropped this plan when he learned Tancred was preparing to invade Azaz, and asked Toghtegin for help. In 1112, they signed a defensive treaty at Aleppo, in return of for recognition of Ridwan&#x27;s formal sovereignty over Damascus. When Baldwin I of Jerusalem invaded Damascus, Toghtegin asked Ridwan for help, but the latter sent only a small force of 100 horsemen. Toghtegin was angered by this and ended the Friday sermon given in Ridwan&#x27;s name in Damascus on 16 August 1113. On 2 October 1113, Mawdud, one of the commanders of the Muslim expedition, was assassinated after his prayers in the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus.Toghtegin accused Ridwan and his Assassin allies of the deed, though most of his contemporaries believed that Toghtegin himself was behind the act.

=== Death and succession ===
Ridwan died on 10 December 1113 in Aleppo and was buried in Meşhedülmelik. Following Ridwan&#x27;s death, groups of armed militiamen, instigated by Ibn al-Khashab, flooded the streets of Aleppo, occupied the major buildings and captured many of Ridwan&#x27;s supporters, notably the members of the Order of Assassins, who were immediately put to death, accused of treachery and collaboration with the Crusaders. Meanwhile, the realm passed to his 16 year-old son, Alp Arslan, who stuttered so severely that he was nicknamed &quot;al-Akhras&quot; (The Mute). His reign, and the following reign of 6 year-old Sultan Shah ibn Radwan, is generally accepted as being under the de facto rule of the atabeg Lu&#x27;lu&#x27; al-Yaya. Alp Arslan initially followed his father&#x27;s pro-Isma&#x27;ili policy, giving them a castle outside of Balis. Despite this, the Seljuk sultan Muhammad I, sent a letter to Alp Arslan, warning him of the dangers of the Assassins and urging him to purge them. Forced by Aleppo&#x27;s population and his patron, Alp Arslan took a series of vigorous measures against the Isma&#x27;ilis, putting Abu Tahir al-Sa&#x27;igh, the chief Nizari Isma&#x27;ili &quot;da&#x27;i&quot; of Syria, and other leading figures to death, and killing or imprisoning about two hundred of the order&#x27;s members. The massacres of the Isma&#x27;ilis effectively eradicated a significant portion of Aleppo&#x27;s Isma&#x27;ili population and eliminated the so-called Assassin threat, though it also deprived Alp Arslan from his only possible support. He also executed two of his brothers, several officers, a few servants, and anyone to whom he took a dislike, which caused discomfort among Aleppans. Alp Arslan then sought Toghtekin&#x27;s protection, but this caused distrust among Aleppo&#x27;s Shi&#x27;a population. Alp Arslan was killed in 1114 on his own atabeg&#x27;s initiative, and anarchy ensued, while Ridwan&#x27;s slaves and Aleppo&#x27;s nobility each tried to impose their authority among the townsmen. The rule of the Seljuk dynasty in Aleppo soon ended in 1118.

<doc id="755986" wikidata="Q668350" url="?curid=755986" title="Live! (The Police album)">
<text>Live! is a live album by The Police, released in 1995 on compact disc and cassette tape. It is the band&#x27;s first live album and one of only two covering their initial period of activity before 1986, the other being &quot;Around The World&quot; (2022). A live album from the reunion tour, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2008.

==Contents==
According to Andy Summers, the idea of releasing an album of live material by The Police went back as far as 1982. Up until that point, a few live tracks had only surfaced on B-sides and compilations such as &quot;Urgh! A Music War&quot; (1980). The plan was to have a new album of the band to act as a stopgap between &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; (1981) and &quot;Synchronicity&quot; (1983). The record was mixed and mastered in Canada but never released. Similar plans took place in 1984 at the tail of the band&#x27;s Synchronicity tour, but the project was shelved again, this time in favour of a greatest hits album (&quot;Every Breath You Take: The Singles&quot;). In 1995, thanks to the technical possibilities and greater running time offered by the CD format, the idea regained momentum and Summers was invited to produce. The album features the band performing at two very distinct periods of its career. Disc one contains almost the complete concert on 27 November 1979 at the Orpheum Theatre in Boston, Massachusetts. It features mostly material from the first two albums, &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot; and &quot;Reggatta de Blanc&quot;, as well as songs only released as singles or B-sides such as &quot;Fall Out&quot; and &quot;Landlord&quot;. The performance was broadcast by the WBCN (FM) radio in Boston. Disc two contains excerpts from two concerts on 2–3 November 1983 in Atlanta, Georgia at The Omni during the Synchronicity tour for the album of the same name. On this occasion the band was augmented by three backing vocalists. Both shows were widely known to fans as they had been circulating in bootleg format for many years. The 1983 shows were also featured in the 1984 Synchronicity Concert VHS and the 2005 DVD release, and a live version of &quot;Tea in the Sahara&quot; had been released as the B-side of &quot;King of Pain&quot; in 1984.

&quot;Live!&quot; contributed to refresh the popularity of The Police about a decade after their break-up. It also had the merit of showcasing the band&#x27;s live activity, and their propensity for rearranging and extending known songs such as &quot;Roxanne&quot; and &quot;Walking on the Moon&quot;. An edited version of &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand Losing You&quot; from the Boston performance was released as a single and reached number 27 in the UK charts, while the album itself reached number 25.

==Reception==
&quot;Live!&quot; was generally well received. David Sinclair in &quot;Q&quot; magazine noted how the album added an important dimension to the band&#x27;s recorded legacy by offering a reminder of why The Police were one of the great performing acts of their day. Paul Colbert from &quot;Encore Magazine&quot; wrote: &quot;It may have taken 10 years for a live album to materialise, but these two CDs were worth the wait, capturing two essential periods, two indispensable sets of material&quot;. Andrew Abrahams emphasised the difference between the two performances, observing how the one in Boston &quot;captures a hungry rock band on its ascent&quot; while the one in Atlanta &quot;is more predictable, revealing a super-group that has settled into fame and commercial acceptability&quot;. In a November 1993 interview with &quot;Q&quot; magazine, Sting seemed to agree on this point: &quot;I remember those small gigs so much better than the stadium shows. I can remember pretty well every night of the first tour: which gigs had tricky stairs to negotiate with the gear; what was said in the dressing room; which encores we did. But a stadium just looks like a stadium&quot;.

<text>Ross S. Bagdasarian (; January 27, 1919 – January 16, 1972), known professionally by his stage name [[David &quot;Dave&quot; Seville]], was an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and actor best known for creating the cartoon band Alvin and the Chipmunks. Initially a stage and film actor, he rose to prominence in 1958 with the songs &quot;Witch Doctor&quot; and &quot;The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don&#x27;t Be Late)&quot;, which both became &quot;Billboard&quot; number-one singles. He produced and directed &quot;The Alvin Show&quot;, which aired on CBS in 1961–62.

==Early life==
Bagdasarian was born on January 27, 1919, in Fresno, California to an Armenian-American family. His father was a grape grower. He had two elder brothers: Richard Sirak (1910–1966) and Harry Sisvan (1915–1989). The novelist William Saroyan, with whom he was very close, was his first cousin.

Bagdasarian graduated from Fresno High School in 1937. He went to New York to work with his cousin Saroyan with the intention of becoming an actor. When World War II started, he enlisted and served four years as a control tower operator and rose to the rank of a staff sergeant (SSgt) in the Army Air Forces. He spent time in England, France and Spain; his later stage name &quot;David Seville&quot; originated from the fact that he was stationed in the city of Seville in Spain and he liked the city.

After the war, he returned to Fresno and married Armenouhi &quot;Armen&quot; Kulhanjian, and they tried for a time to be grape growers. They were unsuccessful and they moved to Los Angeles where he started a career as a songwriter.

==Career==
===Acting===
Bagdasarian&#x27;s Broadway debut was in 1939 when he played the newsboy in &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot; by William Saroyan, his cousin. He also appeared in minor roles in several films, such as &quot;Viva Zapata!&quot; (1952), &quot;Stalag 17&quot; (1953), &quot;Destination Gobi&quot; (1953), and &quot;The Proud and Profane&quot; (1956). In Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954), he is the lonely composer at the piano. 

===Singing and songwriting===
Bagdasarian&#x27;s major success with songwriting came with &quot;Come On-a My House&quot;. The song was rejected by many record companies as being &quot;too ethnic&quot;, until Mitch Miller of Columbia Records came across the song, liked it and persuaded Rosemary Clooney to record it. The song was originally recorded by Kay Armen in 1950, but the version recorded by Rosemary Clooney in 1951 turned into a million-selling hit. It is an adaptation of an Armenian folk song Bagdasarian wrote with his cousin William Saroyan. The song was originally composed for their off-Broadway musical &quot;The Son&quot;. It launched Clooney&#x27;s career, reaching number one on &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and was number four on 
&quot;Billboard&quot; year-end top 30 singles of 1951. The song sold some 750,000 records in a month. In 1954, he wrote &quot;Hey, Brother, Pour the Wine&quot;, a hit for Dean Martin.

In 1955 Bagdasarian signed with the then newly established Liberty Records. In early 1956 he had a transcontinental hit with the novelty record &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot; (inspired by the homonymous Hitchcock film) credited to Alfi &amp; Harry, although Alfi &amp; Harry was just one person, Bagdasarian himself. It reached No. 44 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and was a bigger hit in the United Kingdom reaching No. 15.

In 1956, he wrote an instrumental &quot;Armen&#x27;s Theme&quot; named after his wife. The executives at Liberty Records suggested that he adopt a pseudonym as they thought his name too difficult to pronounce. In December 1956, he charted with his first record credited to his David Seville pseudonym, and &quot;Armen&#x27;s Theme&quot; reached No. 42 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart.

====Dave Seville and the Chipmunks====

Bagdasarian&#x27;s rise to prominence came with the song &quot;Witch Doctor&quot; in 1958, which was created after he experimented with the speed control on a tape recorder bought with $200 () from the family savings. Liberty Records released this novelty record under the David Seville name. It is a duet between his real voice and accelerated version. The record went on to become a &quot;Billboard&quot; number-one single by April 28, 1958, and further established him as a songwriter. It sold 1.5 million copies.

Bagdasarian went on to create his trio of Chipmunks named after the executives of Liberty Records: Simon, Theodore, and Alvin, named for Simon &quot;Si&quot; Waronker, Theodore &quot;Ted&quot; Keep, and Alvin Bennett. Their debut song, &quot;The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don&#x27;t Be Late)&quot; was released on November 17, 1958, and became a number one hit by New Years Day. The song sold 4 million records in the first few months. It topped &quot;Billboard&quot; charts the two weeks before and two weeks after New Years and won three Grammy Awards at the 1st Annual Grammy Awards on May 4, 1959: Best Recording for Children, Best Comedy Performance, and Best Non-Classical Engineered Song. Bagdasarian won the first two as David Seville. The song was the 23rd most performed Christmas song of the 20th century.

Shana Alexander, writing for &quot;Life&quot; magazine in 1959, noted that Bagdasarian was the first case in the &quot;annals of popular music that one man has served as writer, composer, publisher, conductor and multiple vocalist of a hit record, thereby directing all possible revenues from the song back into his pocket.&quot; Alexander also found it remarkable that Bagdasarian &quot;can neither read nor write music nor play any musical instrument in the accepted sense of the word.&quot; Bagdasarian owned Chipmunk Enterprises, which sponsored Chipmunk-related sales. By 1963, some 15 companies were using or planned to use Alvin figures. By that year, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine estimated the total income from the Chipmunks&#x27; record sales (including overseas sales) and record club sales to be around $20 million ($ adjusted for inflation in dollars).

In the following years, the Chipmunks released several hit songs: &quot;Alvin&#x27;s Harmonica&quot; (1959), &quot;Ragtime Cowboy Joe&quot; (1959), &quot;Alvin&#x27;s Orchestra&quot; (1960), &quot;Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer&quot; (1960), &quot;The Alvin Twist&quot; (1962), and the album &quot;The Chipmunks Sing the Beatles Hits&quot; in 1964 during the British Invasion.

Bagdasarian produced &quot;The Alvin Show&quot;, a half-hour TV cartoon show broadcast on CBS from October 1961 to September 1962.

In 1968, Alvin and the Chipmunks recorded a version of &quot;The Chipmunk Song&quot; with the rock band Canned Heat, who also recorded for Liberty Records.

==Personal life==
Bagdasarian married Armenouhi &quot;Armen&quot; Kulhanjian (1927–1991) in 1946. They had three children: Carol Askine (b. 1947), an actress; Ross Jr. (b. 1949); and Adam Serak (b. 1954), a fiction writer. They lived in Los Angeles from 1950. As of 1963, he owned a grape ranch in California called the Chipmunk Ranch. In the mid-1960s, he bought Sierra Wine Corp., a winery that supplied product, among others, to E &amp; J Gallo Winery.

== Death and legacy==
Bagdasarian died of a heart attack at his home in Beverly Hills on January 16, 1972, eleven days before his 53rd birthday. He was cremated and inurned at the Chapel of the Pines Crematory in Los Angeles.

Bagdasarian willed the Chipmunks franchise to his wife and three children. Ross Jr. said in an interview that he &quot;worshipped&quot; his father and felt a need to continue his work. He resumed the franchise with his wife Janice Karman in the late 1970s, after finishing law school, and became the complete owner when he bought the rights from his siblings in the mid-1990s.

<text>The Ugric or Ugrian languages ( or ) are a branch of the Uralic language family.

Ugric includes three subgroups: Hungarian, Khanty, and Mansi. The latter two have traditionally been considered single languages, though their main dialects are sufficiently distinct that they may also be considered small subfamilies of three to four languages each. A common Proto-Ugric language is posited to have been spoken from the end of the 3rd millennium BC until the first half of the 1st millennium BC, in Western Siberia, east of the southern Ural Mountains. Of the three languages, Khanty and Mansi have traditionally been set apart from Hungarian as Ob-Ugric, though features uniting Mansi and Hungarian in particular are known as well.

The name Ugric is derived from &quot;ugry&quot; (), a Russian exonym of the Magyars (Hungarians) and the northern Russian region of Yugra. A connection between these words was first suggested in the beginning of 16th century. However, according to István Vásáry the etymological connection between these two words has not been verified, and the name &quot;Ugric&quot; is based on a folk etymology.

==Phonetic development==

===Consonants===
Two common phonetic features of the Ugric languages are a rearrangement of the Proto-Uralic (PU) system of sibilant consonants and a lenition of velar consonants:
* PU *s and *š merged and developed into a non-sibilant sound (possibly or ), yielding Mansi , Khanty *ɬ → or (depending on dialect), and were lost in Hungarian.
* PU *ś depalatalized to *s.
* PU medial *x, *k, *w generally lenited to *ɣ.
It has however been pointed out that these changes are applicable to the Samoyedic languages as well.

The consonant cluster *lm is in the Ugric languages mostly reduced to plain (e.g. PU &#x27;eye&#x27; → Hungarian &quot;szem&quot;, Mansi сам , Khanty сем ). A peculiar exception is the numeral &#x27;3&#x27;, in which Hungarian (&quot;három&quot;) and Mansi (хурэм ) point to an original cluster *rm, whereas the rest of the Uralic family suggests original *lm (Khanty холәм, Finnish &quot;kolme&quot;, Estonian &quot;kolm&quot;, Inari Sami &quot;kulma&quot;, Erzya колмо, etc.) This has frequently been listed as an argument for considering Hungarian more closely related to Mansi than Khanty. The reverse has also been suggested—Hungarian and Mansi retaining the original form of the numeral, whereas Khanty and all the Finno-Permic languages would have innovated for some reason.

Hungarian and the current literary standard of Mansi and Khanty all share a spirantization of Proto-Uralic *k to or before back vowels, e.g. &#x27;fish&#x27;: PU → Hungarian &quot;hal&quot;, Mansi хул , Khanty хул . This is itself not a common Ugric feature — remains in other Mansi and Khanty dialects (e.g. Eastern Khanty , Southern Mansi &#x27;fish&#x27;), but it has been argued to result from a proto-Ugric split of *k to front and back allophones ~ , with the latter then independently spirantizing in each three cases.

The three Ugric varieties also share the lateralization of Proto-Uralic *δ to *l (as do the Permic languages), but it is possible this postcedes the emergence of retroflex *ɭ from PU *l in Khanty. Another possible counterargument is the similar lateralization of the palatalized counterpart *δ́ → Mansi , likely to have been a simultaneous change with the lateralization of *ð. In Khanty the reflex is , whereas instances of also exist, which may suggest a separate development. An original *ĺ is no longer reconstructed for older stages of Uralic, however, which leaves the origin of Khanty an open question.

An innovation clearly limited to the Ugric languages is the development of *ŋ to *ŋk, though there are numerous exceptions in each language to this.

===Vowels===
The development of the vowel system remains subject to interpretation. All three Ugric branches contrast vowel length; in Hungarian this is late, generally derived by compensatory lengthening after loss of unstressed vowels and *ɣ. The Ob-Ugric languages, however, derive their quantity contrasts mainly from PU quality contrasts: thus for example in Northern Mansi, PU &#x27;ear&#x27; → *päĺ → , but PU &#x27;half&#x27; → *pääl → .

Contrasts between PU stem vowels (*a/*ä vs. *i) do not survive as such in modern Ugric languages, but they commonly leave their mark on vowel qualities in the first syllable, suggesting retention of the contrast at least to the Proto-Ugric stage. For example, PU *ńïxli &#x27;arrow&#x27; → Hungarian &quot;nyíl&quot;, but PU *mïksa &#x27;liver&#x27; → Hungarian &quot;máj&quot;. Remnants of original stem vowels are also found in the oldest Hungarian records, such as PU *konta &#x27;group, hunting party&#x27; → Old Hungarian &quot;hodu&quot; &#x27;army&#x27; (→ Modern Hungarian &quot;had&quot;).

==Lexical features==
The Ugric languages share considerable amounts of common lexicon not found in the other Uralic languages. This includes both basic vocabulary, e.g. &#x27;fire&#x27; (Hungarian &quot;tűz&quot;, Mansi таўт , Khanty тут ) as well as more specialized terminology, particularly the word for &#x27;horse&#x27; (H &quot;ló, lov-&quot;, M луў , Kh лав ) and related items such as &#x27;saddle&#x27; (H &quot;nyereg&quot;, M нагэр ). This latter fact together with an importance of horse motifs in Ob-Ugric folklore has been used to argue for locating Proto-Ugric in the southernmost parts of Siberia, in close contact with nomadic steppe peoples if not nomadic themselves. Some loanwords from such sources into Ugric are known as well, perhaps most prominently the numeral &#x27;7&#x27;: *θäpt(V) → H &quot;hét&quot;, M сат , Kh тапәт (from an Indo-Iranian source; cf. Sanskrit &quot;saptá&quot;, Avestan &quot;hapta&quot;, both from Proto-Indo-Iranian &quot;*saptá&quot; &lt; Proto-Indo-European &quot;&quot;).

&quot;Names&quot; of two of the Ugric peoples are cognate as well: Hungarian &quot;magyar&quot; &#x27;Hungarian&#x27; can be equated with &quot;Mansi&quot; (from an original root *mäńć-). A related word in Khanty denotes a specific phratry.

A common derivational innovation is seen in the word for &#x27;louse&#x27;: Proto-Uralic *täji → *tä(j)-ktVmV → H &quot;tetű&quot;, M такэм, Kh тевтәм.

Holopainen (2023) argues that many known loanwords and suspectable substrate vocabulary show too much irregularity in sound correspondences to be derived from a common Ugric proto-language, and may have been borrowed independently into Hungarian and Ob-Ugric, or even all three of Hungarian, Mansi and Khanty; while for others, it is unclear if they were actually innovated, or represent rather common retention from Proto-Uralic.

==Structural features==
* An original ablative case marked by &quot;-l&quot;
* A series of original locative cases, formed from postpositions derived from a pronoun root &quot;*nä&quot;
* Possessive suffixes are placed before case suffixes, not after them as in the other Uralic languages
* A class of &quot;instable&quot; verb stems, in which alternation between CV and CVC stem variants occurs, e.g. ‘to take’: Hungarian &quot;ve-&quot; ~ &quot;vev-&quot; ~ &quot;&quot;, Mansi &quot;*wi-&quot; ~ &quot;*wæj-&quot;, Khanty &quot;*wĕ-&quot; ~ &quot;*wĕj-&quot;.
* Distinct attributive and nominal forms of the numeral &#x27;2&#x27;: Hungarian &quot;&quot; vs. &quot;&quot;, Mansi кит vs. китиг, Khanty (Northern) кат vs. катән, (Eastern) vs. 
* Found in Hungarian and Mansi, an extended form of the caritive suffix containing &quot;-l&quot;.
* Distinct verb conjugations according to the transitivity of the verb. It is sometimes termed as “definite” versus “indefinite” conjugation, because also the definiteness of the object can play a role when selecting between the two. This feature is within the Uralic family also found in the Mordvinic languages, and it is likely to not represent a common Ugric innovation; the particular details of the construction are different in all three Ugric languages.
* Verbal prefixes, which modify the meaning of the verb in both concrete and abstract ways

;Examples from Mansi

ēl(a) – &#x27;forwards, onwards, away&#x27;
xot – &#x27;direction away from something and other nuances of action intensity&#x27;
;Examples from Hungarian

el – &#x27;away, off&#x27;
ki – &#x27;out (of)&#x27;
In Hungarian, the citation form of verbs is the present tense indicative of the 3rd person singular form, which is given here, which does not have any suffixes.

<text>In computing, Download.ject (also known as Toofer and Scob) is a malware program for Microsoft Windows servers. When installed on an insecure website running on Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), it appends malicious JavaScript to all pages served by the site.

Download.ject was the first noted case in which users of Internet Explorer for Windows could infect their computers with malware (a backdoor and key logger) merely by &quot;viewing&quot; a web page. It came to prominence during a widespread attack starting June 23, 2004, when it infected many servers including several that hosted financial sites. Security consultants prominently started promoting the use of Opera or Mozilla Firefox instead of IE in the wake of this attack.

Download.ject is not a virus or a worm; it does not spread by itself. The June 23 attack is hypothesised to have been put into place by automatic scanning of servers running IIS.
==Attack of June 23, 2004==

Hackers placed Download.ject on financial and corporate websites running IIS 5.0 on Windows 2000, breaking in using a known vulnerability. (A patch existed for the vulnerability, but many administrators had not applied it.) The attack was first noticed June 23, although some researchers think it may have been in place as early as June 20.

Download.ject appended a fragment of JavaScript to all web pages from the compromised servers. When any page on such a server was viewed with Internet Explorer (IE) for Windows, the JavaScript would run, retrieve a copy of one of various backdoor and key logging programs from a server located in Russia and install it on the user&#x27;s machine, using two holes in IE — one with a patch available, but the other without. These vulnerabilities were present in all versions of IE for Windows except the version included in Windows XP Service Pack 2, which was only in beta testing at the time.

Both the server and browser flaws had been exploited before this. This attack was notable, however, for combining the two, for having been placed upon popular mainstream websites (although a list of affected sites was not released) and for the network of compromised sites used in the attack reportedly numbering in the thousands, far more than any previous such compromised network.

Microsoft advised users on how to remove an infection and to browse with security settings at maximum. Security experts also advised switching off JavaScript, using a web browser other than Internet Explorer, using an operating system other than Windows, or staying off the Internet altogether.

This particular attack was neutralised on June 25 when the server from which Download.ject installed a backdoor was shut down. Microsoft issued a patch for Windows 2000, 2003 and XP on July 2.

Although not a sizable attack compared to email worms of the time, the fact that almost all existing installations of IE — 95% of web browsers in use at the time — were vulnerable, and that this was the latest in a series of IE holes leaving the underlying operating system vulnerable, caused a notable wave of concern in the press. Even some business press started advising users to switch to other browsers, despite the then-prerelease Windows XP SP2 being invulnerable to the attack.

<text>Ravi Shankar Sharma (3 March 1926 – 7 March 2012), often referred mononymously as Ravi, was an Indian music director who had composed music for several Hindi and Malayalam films.

After a successful career in Hindi cinema, he took a hiatus in the 1970s and made a successful comeback in 1982 in the Malayalam music scene under the stage name Bombay Ravi.

== Biography ==
Ravi was born in Delhi on 3 March 1926. He had no formal training in classical music; instead he learned music by listening to his father sing bhajans. In 1947 he went meet the famous singer Mohammed Rafi who was singing at the independence day celebration event ‘Jashn e Jamhooriat’ at the Coronation Hotel, Fatehpur, Delhi. He told Rafi that he wanted to be music director. According to Ravi, Mohammed Rafi advised him to first learn music and notation. He taught himself to play harmonium and other classical instruments and worked as an electrician at the Post and Telegraph, Delhi, to support his family. In 1950, he decided to shift to Bombay and become a professional singer. At first Ravi was homeless, living on the streets and sleeping on Malad railway station at night. Later, he lived in a tin house before he became a success story.

In 1952, Ravi was discovered by Hemant Kumar who hired him to sing backing vocals in &quot;Vande Mataram&quot; from the film &quot;Anand Math&quot; (1952 film). Hemant Kumar was not very familiar with Urdu language, so Ravi would help him out.

Ravi composed several hit songs and received Filmfare nominations for the following films: &quot;Chaudhvin Ka Chand&quot; (1960), &quot;Do Badan&quot; (1966), &quot;Hamraaz&quot; (1967), &quot;Ankhen&quot; (1968), and &quot;Nikaah&quot; (1982). He won Filmfare awards for &quot;Gharana&quot; (1961) and &quot;Khandan&quot; (1965). His other successful films include &quot;Waqt&quot;, &quot;Neel Kamal&quot; and &quot;Gumraah&quot;. His songs &quot;Aaj mere yaar ki shaadi hai&quot;, &quot;Babul ki duyaen leti ja&quot;, &quot;Doli chadh ke dulhan sasural chali&quot; and &quot;Mere Yaar Bana hai Dulha&quot; became very popular in wedding celebrations.

Ravi was one of the music directors who shaped the career of Asha Bhosle with songs like &quot;Tora man darpan kehlaye&quot;, &quot;Aage bhi jane na tu &quot; and &quot;Sun le Pukar Aai&quot;. He was also instrumental in making Mahendra Kapoor a popular singer in Bollywood. After a successful career in Hindi films during the 1950s and 1960s, he took a long break after 1970 till 1982. In 1982, he gave music for the Hindi film &quot;Nikaah&quot;, and one of the film&#x27;s songs &quot;Dil ke armaan aansooyon main beh gaye&quot; sung by Salma Agha won her the Filmfare Best Female Playback Award.

In the 1980s, he made a comeback as a music director in Malayalam (and some Hindi) films as Bombay Ravi. During 1986, the Malayalam director Hariharan convinced him to make this comeback. The first movie was &quot;Panchagni&quot;. The songs &quot;Saagarangale&quot; and &quot;Aa raatri maanju poyi&quot; (sung by Yesudas and Chitra) were hits. That same year, Hariharan&#x27;s &quot;Nakhakshathangal&quot; also came out and Chithra won her second National Award for the song &quot;Manjalprasaadavum&quot; from the same film. All the songs from the Malayalam movie &quot;Vaisali&quot; released in 1989 were super hits and Chithra won her third National Award for the song &quot;Indupushpam Choodi Nilkum&quot; from the same film. Ravi was a constant in Hariharan films and their combination is regarded as one of the best ever in Malayalam. Ravi has composed for many films produced by South Indian banners: &quot;Ghoonghat&quot;, &quot;Gharana&quot; &quot;Grihasti&quot;, &quot;Aurat&quot;, &quot;Samaj ko badal dalo&quot; (Gemini), &quot;Meherban&quot;, &quot;Do Kaliyan&quot; (AVM), &quot;Bharosa&quot;, and &quot;Khandan&quot; (Vasu Films).

Ravi&#x27;s most notable work is with Chopra brothers. From Gumrah he continuously worked with Sahir Ludhianvi, the lyricist. Waqt, Humraaz, Admi aur Insan, Dhund, Nikah and Dehleez were among his all-time hit films He was very comfortable with Sahir and gave beautiful tunes to his poetry also for Aaj aur kal, Kajal, Ankhein, Neelkamal, Do kaliyan, Amanat, Ganga tera pani amrit, and Ek mahal ho sapno ka.

== Personal life ==
Ravi&#x27;s wife Kanti, whom he married in 1946, died in 1986. He had two daughters Veena and Chhaya and a son Ajay. His estranged son Ajay is married to Varsha Usgaonkar who is a Marathi and Hindi film actress. They are estranged due to a property dispute. One of his daughters was living with him and taking care of him since his wife&#x27;s death.

Ravi died on 7 March 2012 in Mumbai at the age of 86.

Ravi was responsible for a number of hit tunes of Hindi film songs. His music went on to inspire later day music directors too. The opening bars of &quot;Chanda Mama Door Ke&quot; inspired the tune for the hit song &quot;Ek Do Teen&quot; in the 1988 film &quot;Tezaab&quot;. Ravi is reportedly quoted as saying, &quot;Since I choose written poetry to compose, the lyricist and the composer have full freedom to write and compose.&quot;

<text>Jay Anthony Lukas (April 25, 1933 – June 5, 1997) was an American journalist and author, best known for his 1985 book &quot;Common Ground: A Turbulent Decade in the Lives of Three American Families&quot;. &quot;Common Ground&quot; is a study of race relations, class conflict, and school busing in Boston, Massachusetts, as seen through the eyes of three families: one upper-middle-class white, one working-class white, and one working-class African-American. He has won two Pulitzer Prizes.

== Early life and education ==
J. Anthony Lukas was born to Elizabeth and Edwin Lukas in White Plains, New York. His mother was an actress and his uncle Paul Lukas was an Academy Award–winning actor. Lukas at first wanted to be an actor. After his mother committed suicide and his father&#x27;s illness after her death, he was at the age of eight enrolled in the coeducational Putney School in Vermont. His younger brother, Christopher Lukas, born in 1935, is a television producer and writer.

Lukas attended Harvard University, where he worked at the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; and graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1955. He continued his education at the Free University of Berlin as an Adenauer Fellow. Thereafter, he served in the United States Army in Japan, where he wrote commentaries for the Voice of the United Nations Command (VUNC).

==Career==
Lukas began his professional journalism career at &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; and then moved to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He stayed at the &quot;Times&quot; for nine years, working as a roving reporter, and serving at the Washington, D.C., New York City, and United Nations bureaus, and overseas in Ceylon, India, Japan, Pakistan, South Africa and Zaire. After working at &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; as a staff writer and freelancer for a short time in the 1970s (where he notably covered the Watergate scandal in two issue-length articles that served as the basis for a 1976 book, &quot;Nightmare: The Underside of the Nixon Years&quot;, and even correctly guessed that Deep Throat, the secret informant who provided information on the scandal to Bob Woodward, was Mark Felt), Lukas quit reporting to pursue a career in book and magazine writing, becoming known for writing intensely researched nonfiction works. He was a contributor to &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, and the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;. Additionally, he was the co-founder and editor of &quot;MORE&quot;, a &quot;critical journal&quot; on the news media which folded in 1978, and a &quot;contributing editor to the &quot;New Times&quot;, an alternative magazine that also folded in 1978.&quot;

==Death==
Lukas was diagnosed with depression in the late 1980s. In an interview that followed the publication of &quot;Common Ground&quot; in 1985, he had given some hints about his frame of mind, linking it with his career as a writer:

All writers are, to one extent or another, damaged people. Writing is our way of repairing ourselves. In my own case, I was filling a hole in my life which opened at the age of eight, when my mother killed herself, throwing our family into utter disarray. My father quickly developed tuberculosis – psychosomatically triggered, the doctors thought – forcing him to seek treatment in an Arizona sanatorium. We sold our house and my brother and I were shipped off to boarding school. Effectively, from the age of eight, I had no family, and certainly no community. That&#x27;s one reason the book worked: I wasn&#x27;t just writing a book about busing. I was filling a hole in myself.

In 1997, Lukas&#x27; book, &quot;Big Trouble: A Murder in a Small Western Town Sets Off a Struggle for the Soul of America&quot;, was undergoing final revisions. Lukas committed suicide on June 5. The suicide occurred in his apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He was survived by his wife, book editor Linda Healey.

==Awards==
Lukas won his first Pulitzer Prize in 1968 for &quot;The Two Worlds of Linda Fitzpatrick&quot; in the now-defunct award category of Local Investigative Specialized Reporting. The &quot;New York Times&quot; article documented the life of a teenager from a wealthy, Greenwich, Connecticut-based family who became involved in drugs and the hippie movement before being bludgeoned to death in the basement of an East Village tenement. Lukas was previously awarded a George Polk Award in Local Reporting in 1967 for the story.

Almost twenty years later, he received the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction for &quot;Common Ground&quot;,
as well as the U.S. National Book Award for Nonfiction, the National Book Critics Award, the 1985-1986 Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights Book Award and the Political Book of the Year Award.

The Lukas Prize Project, co-administered by the Columbia University&#x27;s Graduate School of Journalism and the Nieman Foundation at Harvard, supports the work of American nonfiction writers. It hosts conferences and presents three annual awards: the J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize, the Mark Lynton History Prize, and the J. Anthony Lukas Work-in-Progress Award.

==Selected publications==
* &quot;The Two Worlds of Linda Fitzpatrick&quot;, 1967, &quot;The New York Times&quot; article on the life and death of a teenager in the 1960s counterculture — winner of the Pulitzer Prize
* &quot;The Barnyard Epithet and Other Obscenities: Notes on the Chicago Conspiracy Trial&quot;, 1970, a story on the Chicago Seven, aka the Chicago Eight
* &quot;Don&#x27;t Shoot, We Are Your Children!&quot;, 1971, a collection of stories about members of the 1960s counterculture (including the Linda Fitzpatrick article). A section by Kai Erikson —sociologist and professor of American studies at Yale and editor of &quot;The Yale Review&quot;— challenged the view that there was a &quot;generation gap&quot; between the sixties generation and their parents generations, arguing that the sixties generation expressed overtly what previous generations had expressed covertly.
* &quot;After the Pentagon Papers–A Month in the New Life of Daniel Ellsberg&quot;, 1971, &quot;The New York Times&quot; story on Ellsberg&#x27;s meetings with various anti-Vietnam War activists, motivations behind leaking the Papers, and friendships with Harry Rowen and Tony Russo.
* &quot;Nightmare: The Underside of the Nixon Years&quot;, 1976, a book on Richard Nixon and the Watergate scandal, originating in two long, detailed issue-length articles on Watergate for &quot;The New York Times Sunday Magazine&quot;, and a third underway but canceled when Nixon resigned. Lukas completed work on the third article and used it as the final section of the book. In the book, Lukas correctly guesses that Mark Felt was Deep Throat.
* &quot;Common Ground: A Turbulent Decade in the Lives of Three American Families&quot;, 1985, a book on busing and school desegregation in Boston and three families and their histories.
* &quot;Big Trouble&quot;, 1997, a posthumously published history of a struggle between unions and mining company officials and supporters in Idaho, early in the twentieth century, after the bombing assassination of former Idaho governor Frank Steunenberg.

<text>George Benjamin Luks (August 13, 1867 – October 29, 1933) was an American artist, identified with the aggressively realistic Ashcan School of American painting.
After travelling and studying in Europe, Luks worked as a newspaper illustrator and cartoonist in Philadelphia, where he became part of a close-knit group, led by Robert Henri, that set out to defy the genteel values imposed by the influential National Academy of Design. His best-known paintings reflect the life of the poor and hard-pressed on Manhattan’s Lower East Side.

==Early life and career==


Luks was born in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, to Central European immigrants. According to the 1880 census, his father was born in Poland and his mother in Bavaria, Germany. His father was a physician and apothecary and his mother was an amateur painter and musician. The Luks family eventually moved to Pottsville, Pennsylvania, in east central Pennsylvania, near the coal fields. In this setting, he learned at a young age about poverty and compassion as he observed his parents helping the coal miners&#x27; families.

Luks began his working life in vaudeville. He and his younger brother played the Pennsylvania and New Jersey vaudeville circuit in the early 1880s while still in their teens. 

He left performing when he decided to pursue a career as an artist. Luks knew from a young age that he wanted to be an artist and studied briefly at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts before he traveled to Europe, where he attended several art schools and studied the Old Masters. He became an admirer of Spanish and Dutch painting, especially the work of Diego Velázquez and Frans Hals. Manet&#x27;s energy and technique also appealed to Luks. Later he went to Düsseldorf, where he lived with a distant relative, allegedly a retired lion tamer, and took classes at the Düsseldorf School of Art. He eventually abandoned Düsseldorf for the more stimulating spheres of London and Paris. 

== Cartoonist ==
In 1893, Luks returned to Philadelphia, where he eventually found work as an illustrator for the &quot;Philadelphia Press&quot;. As Robert L. Gambone writes, &quot;Luks&#x27;s experience as a &quot;Press&quot; artist-reporter proved seminal to his career, not so much for the work he accomplished as for the lifelong friends he acquired.&quot; Working at that newspaper, he met John Sloan, William Glackens, and Everett Shinn. These men would gather for weekly meetings, ribaldly social as well as intellectual, at the studio of Robert Henri, a painter several years their senior. Henri encouraged his younger friends to read Whitman, Emerson, Zola, and Ibsen as well as William Morris Hunt&#x27;s &quot;Talks on Art&quot; and George Moore&#x27;s &quot;Modern Painting&quot;. Chafing under the limitations of the Genteel Tradition, he wanted them to consider the need for a new style of painting that would speak more to their own time and experience. Henri was a persuasive advocate for the vigorous depiction of ordinary life; he believed American painters needed to shun genteel subjects and academic polish and to learn to paint more rapidly. In Luks, he had a ready listener but also a man who was never going to be comfortable in the role of acolyte.

In 1896, Luks moved to New York City and began work as an artist for Joseph Pulitzer&#x27;s &quot;New York World&quot;, where one of his assignments was to draw the popular &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot; comic strip series (featuring the Yellow Kid). Luks began drawing the Yellow Kid after its creator, Richard F. Outcault, departed the &quot;World&quot; for William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s &quot;New York Journal.&quot; 

During his time as an illustrator there, he lived with William Glackens. Along with Everett Shinn and Robert Henri, Glackens encouraged Luks to spend more time on his serious painting. What ensued were several productive years in which Luks painted some of the most vigorous examples of what would be called &quot;Ashcan art.&quot;

==&quot;The Eight&quot;==
The rejection of many of their paintings, including works by Luks, from the exhibitions of the powerful, conservative National Academy of Design motivated Henri&#x27;s followers to form their own short-lived independent exhibiting group. Consisting of Robert Henri, George Luks, William Glackens, John Sloan, Everett Shinn, Arthur B. Davies, Ernest Lawson, and Maurice Prendergast, the group exhibited as &quot;The Eight&quot; in January 1908. Their exhibition at the Macbeth Galleries in New York was a significant event in the promotion of twentieth-century American art. Although the styles of &quot;The Eight&quot; differed greatly (Davies, Lawson, and Prendergast were not urban realists), what unified the group was their advocacy of exhibition opportunities free from the jury system as well as their belief in content and painting techniques that were not necessarily sanctioned by the Academy. The traveling exhibition organized by John Sloan that followed the New York show brought the paintings to Chicago, Indianapolis, Toledo, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Bridgeport, and Newark and helped to promote a national debate about the new realism that the Ashcan school represented. Luks&#x27; &quot;Feeding the Pigs&quot; and &quot;Mammy Groody&quot; were seen as examples of this new earthiness many art lovers were not ready to accept.

==Ashcan School==

Luks painted working-class subjects and scenes of urban life, the hallmarks of Ashcan realism, with great gusto. &quot;Hester Street&quot; (1905), in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum, captures Jewish immigrant life through Luks&#x27;s vigorously painted representation of shoppers, pushcart peddlers, casual strollers, and curious onlookers of the ethnic variety that characterized turn-of-the century New York. Luks&#x27;s work typifies the real-life scenes painted by the Ashcan School artists. &quot;Hester Street&quot; also demonstrates Luks&#x27; ability to effectively manipulate crowded compositions and to capture expressions and gestures as well as gritty background details. &quot;Allen Street&quot; (1905) and &quot;Houston Street&quot; (1917) are equally successful in this sense. The Lower East Side was a rich source of visual material for George Luks.

The Ashcan School successfully challenged academic art institutions, and the authority of the National Academy of Design as a cultural arbiter declined throughout the 1910s. At a time when the realist fiction of Theodore Dreiser and Frank Norris was gaining a wider audience and when muckraking journalists were calling attention to slum conditions in American cities, the Ashcan painters played a role in enlarging the nation&#x27;s sense of what a suitable topic for artistic expression might be. The difference, though, between the realist writers and socially-minded journalists, on the one hand, and the painters, on the other hand, was that the Ashcan artists did not see their work primarily as social or political criticism.

The first known use of the &quot;ash can&quot; terminology in describing the movement was by Art Young, in 1916, but the term was applied later not only to the Henri circle, but also to such painters as George Bellows (another student of Henri), Jerome Myers, Gifford Beal, Glenn Coleman, Carl Sprinchorn, and Mabel Dwight and even to photographers Jacob Riis and Lewis Hine, who portrayed New York&#x27;s working-class neighborhoods in a sometimes brutally realistic fashion.

In 1905, Luks painted two of his most famous works, icons of the Ashcan school: &quot;The Spielers&quot;, now in the collection of the Addison Gallery of American Art, and &quot;The Wrestlers&quot;, now in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.

These two paintings also illustrate radically different aspects of Luks&#x27; temperament. In &quot;The Spielers,&quot; two young girls dance frenetically, their joyous faces forming an appealing contrast to their grimy hands.

Luks portrays the ability of working-class children to experience pleasure despite their circumstances. Sentimental or otherwise, he painted the truth, as he saw it, as his friend Everett Shinn wrote. &quot;The Wrestlers,&quot; on the other hand, is a testament to masculine bravado, a massive, sumptuously painted canvas in which one beefy man has been pinned to the mat by another; the face of the defeated wrestler, turned upside down, stares straight at us. The pose is contorted, every muscle bulges, and the paint reflects the sweat and strain of the match.

Luks was respected as a master of strong color effects. When interviewed on the topic, he said, &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you the whole secret! Color is simply light and shade. You don&#x27;t need pink or grey or blue so long as you have volume. Pink and blue change with light or time. Volume endures.&quot;

Although Luks is most well known for his depictions of New York City life, he also painted landscapes and portraits and was an accomplished watercolorist. His visual perception was acute, no matter the genre, the art critic Sadakichi Hartmann noted. In later years, he painted society portraits (e.g., &quot;Society Girl&quot;). His style was not uniform throughout his career, though. &quot;The Cafe Francis&quot; (1906) contains more impressionist touches than his usual dark scenes of lower-class urban life, and his interest in documentary accuracy varied. &quot;Sulky Boy&quot; (1908), for example, depicts the son of a doctor at Bellevue Hospital who treated Luks for alcoholism, but it has been noted that Luks was more concerned with depicting the boy&#x27;s demeanor than conveying an authentic representation of the surroundings.

Like Henri and Sloan, Luks was also a teacher, first at the Arts Students League on West 57th Street in Manhattan and, later, across the street at a school he established himself, which remained open until the time of his death. One student, the painter Elsie Driggs, remembered him as a charismatic force in the classroom. He enjoyed the adulation of his pupils and was a great raconteur. He was not interested in preaching the tenets of modernism; his commitment was to realism and direct observation.

His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

==Personality==
Luks was a born rebel and one of the most distinctive personalities in American art. &quot;He is Puck. He is Caliban. He is Falstaff,&quot; his contemporary, the art critic James Gibbons Huneker, wrote. Like many of the later Abstract Expressionist men, he made a great display of his masculinity and could seldom retreat from a dare. He took pride in being known as the &quot;bad boy&quot; of American art, liked to characterize himself as entirely self-created, and downplayed the influence of Robert Henri, or any contemporary, on his artistic development. He was given to hyperbolic statements and was often intentionally vague about autobiographical details, preferring to maintain an aura of self-mythologizing mystery. He was equally at home at a prize fight or in a tavern as in a museum or a gallery. Luks was always a heavy drinker, and his friend and one-time roommate William Glackens often had to undress him and haul him to bed after a night of drunken debauchery. Although many sources confirm this tendency, they also characterize him as a man with a kind heart who befriended people living on the edge who became subjects for his works of art. Examples of this are numerous: e.g., &quot;Widow McGee&quot; (1902) or &quot;The Old Duchess&quot; and &quot;The Rag Picker&quot; (both of 1905), in which Luks depicted with sensitivity elderly, down-and-out women who knew the harsh realities of the street. Luks was a paradox: a man of enormous egotism and a great generosity of spirit.

==Personal life and death==
Luks was married twice but had no children. 

Luks was found dead in a doorway by a policeman in the early morning hours of October 29, 1933. Ira Glackens, the son of William Glackens, wrote about Luks&#x27;s death that, contrary to the newspaper account stating that the painter had succumbed on his way to paint the dawn sky, he had actually been beaten to death in an altercation with a customer at a nearby bar.

His packed funeral was attended by family, former students, and past and present friends. He was buried in an 18th-century embroidered waistcoat, one of his most valued possessions. He is buried at Fernwood Cemetery in Royersford, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="756058" wikidata="Q44584" url="?curid=756058" title="Hans Magnus Enzensberger">
<text>Hans Magnus Enzensberger (11 November 1929 – 24 November 2022) was a German author, poet, translator, and editor. He also wrote under the pseudonyms Andreas Thalmayr, Elisabeth Ambras, Linda Quilt and Giorgio Pellizzi. Enzensberger was regarded as one of the literary founding figures of the Federal Republic of Germany and wrote more than 70 books, with works translated into 40 languages. He was one of the leading authors in Group 47, and influenced the 1968 West German student movement. He was awarded the Georg Büchner Prize and the Pour le Mérite, among many others.

== Life and career ==
Enzensberger was born in 1929 in Kaufbeuren, a small town in Bavaria, as the eldest of four boys. His father, Andreas Enzensberger, worked as a telecommunications technician, and his mother, Leonore (Ledermann) Enzensberger, a kindergarten teacher. Enzensberger was part of the last generation of intellectuals whose writing was shaped by first-hand experience of Nazi Germany. The Enzensberger family moved to Nuremberg in 1931. Julius Streicher, the founder and publisher of the virulently antisemitic &quot;Der Stürmer&quot;, was their next-door neighbour. Hans Magnus joined the Hitler Youth in his teens, but was expelled soon afterwards. &quot;I have always been incapable of being a good comrade. I can&#x27;t stay in line. It&#x27;s not in my character. It may be a defect, but I can&#x27;t help it.&quot;

In 1949, after completing his &quot;Abitur&quot; in Nördlingen, Enzensberger studied literature and philosophy at the universities of Erlangen, Freiburg, and Hamburg, and at the Sorbonne in Paris, receiving his doctorate in 1955 for a thesis about Clemens Brentano&#x27;s poetry. Until 1957 he worked as a radio editor in Stuttgart with Alfred Andersch; he criticized in a radio essay &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;″s language style. He became one of the leading authors in the Group 47, an institution that shaped the culture of Germany after World War II. In 1957 Group 47 member Ingeborg Bachmann and Enzensberger began to exchange letters. His first literary publication was the poem collection &quot;verteidigung der wölfe&quot; (Defense of the Wolves) in 1957, followed by &quot;landessprache&quot; in 1960, both originally in all-lowercase. They were perceived as opposition to the establishment of those who had been on battle fields and in camps, described as &quot;furious, elegant and of controlled rage&quot; (&quot;furios, elegant und von kontrollierter Wut&quot;). He played the role &quot;zorniger junger Mann&quot; (angry young man) as British role models. In 1960, he was the editor of &quot;Museum der modernen Poesie&quot; (Museum of modern poetry), an anthology of poems by contemporary authors in a juxtaposition of original and translation, which was rare at the time. From 1960 to 1961, Enzensberger was a literary editor () at Suhrkamp in Frankfurt. He spoke several languages, intensified by travels: English, French, Italian, Spanish, Norwegian, Swedish and some Russian. With a volume of essays published in 1962, &quot;Einzelheiten&quot;, he entered the position of a critical intellectual which he held for life. 

Between 1965 and 1975 he lived briefly in the United States (Fellow of the Center for Advanced Studies Wesleyan University) and Cuba. He had the composer Hans Werner Henze invited to Cuba in 1969, and wrote the libretto for his &quot;El Cimarrón&quot; for baritone and three instrumentalists based on the memories of the escaped slave Esteban Montejo.
From 1965, Enzensberger edited the magazine &#x27;; his writings influenced the 1968 West German student movement. He was editor of the prestigious book series &#x27;, published in Frankfurt, from 1985; it reached almost 250 titles. He promoted the writers Ryszard Kapuscinski, Raoul Schrott, Irene Dische, Christoph Ransmayr, and W.G. Sebald, among others. Together with Gaston Salvatore, Enzensberger was the founder of the left-wing monthly &quot;&quot;. The literary journal survived for only two years. 

In his 1987 book &quot;Ach Europa! Wahrnehmungen aus sieben Ländern&quot;, Enzensberger used already the terms Ossi and Wessi.

==Personal life==
Enzensberger was the older brother of the author Christian Enzensberger. He was married three times, including once to Masha Enzensberger, and had two daughters, including . Mathematics was his passion.

Enzensberger lived in Norway, Italy, Mexico, Cuba, the United States, West Berlin, and since 1979 in Munich where he died on 24 November 2022, at age 93.

== Work ==
Enzensberger wrote in a sarcastic, ironic tone in many of his poems. For example, the poem &quot;Middle Class Blues&quot; consists of various typicalities of middle class life, with the phrase &quot;we can&#x27;t complain&quot; repeated several times, and concludes with &quot;what are we waiting for?&quot;. Many of his poems also feature themes of civil unrest over economic- and class-based issues. Though primarily a poet and essayist, he also ventured into theatre, film, opera, radio drama, reportage and translation. He wrote novels and several books for children (including &quot;The Number Devil&quot;, an exploration of mathematics, translated in 34 languages) and was co-author of a book for German as a foreign language, &quot;(Die Suche)&quot;. He often wrote his poems and letters in lower case. &quot;Tumult&quot;, written in 2014, is an autobiographical reflection of his 1960s as a left-wing sympathizer visiting the Soviet Union and Cuba. His own work has been translated into more than 40 languages.
Enzensberger also invented and collaborated in the construction of a machine which automatically composes poems (). This was used during the 2006 Football World Cup to commentate on games.

Enzensberger criticized the German orthography reform, the dominance of the internet and the construction of the EU.

Enzensberger translated Adam Zagajewski, Lars Gustafsson, Pablo Neruda, W. H. Auden and César Vallejo. With Irene Dische he wrote the libretto for Sallinen&#x27;s fifth opera &quot;The Palace&quot;. The theatre premiere of a drama after his long poem &quot;Der Untergang der Titanic&quot; on 7 May 1980 was directed by George Tabori at the Werkraumtheater Munich.

=== &quot;Consciousness industry&quot; ===
Enzensberger&#x27;s 1974 work &quot;The consciousness industry; on literature, politics and the media&quot; gave rise to the term &quot;consciousness industry&quot;, which identifies the mechanisms through which the human mind is reproduced as a social product. Foremost among these mechanisms are the institutions of mass media and education. According to Enzensberger, the mind industry does not produce anything specific; rather, its main business is to perpetuate the existing order of man&#x27;s domination over man. Hans Haacke elaborates on the consciousness industry as it applies to the arts in a wider system of production, distribution, and consumption. Haacke specifically implicates museums as manufacturers of aesthetic perception that fail to acknowledge their intellectual, political, and moral authority: &quot;rather than sponsoring intelligent, critical awareness, museums thus tend to foster appeasement.&quot;

== Honors and awards ==

<doc id="756061" wikidata="Q5248432" url="?curid=756061" title="Debra (song)">
<text>&quot;Debra&quot; is a song by the American musician Beck. It was released on his 1999 album &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot;.

==Background==
Beck had originally attempted to record and release &quot;Debra&quot; with the Dust Brothers for 1996&#x27;s &quot;Odelay&quot;, but he thought that it was too tongue-in-cheek. It debuted mainstream in 1996, and, as Beck noted, &quot;it became the centerpiece of the whole set. It was the song that people would react to more than the songs that they&#x27;d heard on the radio. So we kept playing it and playing it&quot;. The song finally made it on to &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot; in 1999.

==Composition==
The song&#x27;s lyrics are about meeting a girl named Jenny who works at the retail store JCPenney and wanting to &quot;get with&quot; her and her sister, Debra. The lyrics include a reference to the Los Angeles-based restaurant chain Zankou Chicken, as well as a mention of car manufacturer Hyundai and a reference to another song on &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot;, &quot;Sexx Laws&quot;.

&quot;Debra&quot; contains samples of two songs; &quot;Win&quot; by David Bowie and &quot;My Love for You&quot; by Ramsey Lewis.

==In popular culture==
Many music critics consider &quot;Debra&quot; to be one of Beck&#x27;s greatest songs, with Ty Kulik claiming that &quot;&quot;Midnite Vultures&quot; is a tremendous record, and &quot;Debra&quot; is the highlight of the whole record.&quot; The song was used in the 2017 Edgar Wright film &quot;Baby Driver&quot; and appeared on its soundtrack and as inspiration for music by Flight of the Conchords.

==Cover versions==
The song was covered by German industrial artist Kompressor on his 2003 album &quot;Industrial Archives&quot;. Kompressor&#x27;s version is called &quot;Kompressor Want to Get with You&quot;.

Additionally, the song has been covered in live shows by the US band I Dont Know How But They Found Me. This version was released digitally on 26 February 2021 and appeared on their EP &quot;Razmatazz B-Sides&quot;.

The jam band Umphrey’s McGee also covers &quot;Debra&quot; in live shows, most notably at Sweetwater 420 Fest in Atlanta in 2022.

<doc id="756065" wikidata="Q2154479" url="?curid=756065" title="Rinus Michels">
<text>Marinus Jacobus Hendricus &quot;Rinus&quot; Michels (; 9 February 1928 – 3 March 2005) was a Dutch football player and coach. He played his entire career for Ajax, which he later managed, and played for and later managed the Netherlands national team for four spells. Throughout his career, he played as a forward. He is regarded as one of the greatest managers of all time.

Michels became most notable for his coaching achievements; he won the European Cup with Ajax and the Spanish league with Barcelona, and had four tenures as coach of the Netherlands national team, who he led to reach the final of the 1974 FIFA World Cup and to win the 1988 UEFA European Championship.

He is credited with the invention of a major football playing style and set of tactics known as &quot;Total Football&quot; in the 1970s. He was named Coach of the Century by FIFA in 1999, in 2007 the greatest post-war football coach by &quot;The Times&quot; and in 2019 the greatest coach in the history of football by &quot;France Football&quot;.

==Playing career==
===Early life===
Michels was born in Amsterdam and grew up at the Olympiaweg, a street near the Olympic Stadium. He celebrated his ninth birthday on 9 February 1937, when he received a pair of football boots and an Ajax jersey. Moments later, he was playing with his father at a small field near their home. Via Joop Köhler, a friend of the family who was commissioner at Ajax, Michels was introduced to the club and became a junior member in 1940. When World War II started, and especially during the Dutch famine of 1944–45, Michels&#x27; career was set on hold.

French club Lille had also wanted to sign Michels, but a playing career abroad did not materialize, as the Royal Netherlands Army did not allow him to go because he had to serve on active duty.

===Ajax first team===

On 9 June 1946, Michels was invited into Ajax&#x27;s first team squad to replace the injured Han Lambregt. In his debut, Ajax beat ADO 8–3, and Michels scored five times. That season, Ajax won their 14th division championship and a year later they won the Dutch national championship. Although there were doubts about Michels&#x27; technical skills, team members like Cor van der Hart and captain Joop Stoffelen were enthusiastic about his strength and heading capabilities. Indeed, Michels was characterized for his hard work rather than for his technical qualities.

He went on to become a regular for the club, and between 1946 and 1958, he appeared in 264 league matches for Ajax, in which he scored 122 goals. In 1958, four years after the introduction of professional football in the Netherlands and one year after winning his second league title, he was forced to end his career due to a back injury.

===National team===
Michels&#x27; international playing career with the Netherlands national team lasted five matches, making his debut on 8 June 1950 away to Sweden, a 4–1 defeat. He also lost all of his remaining matches as an &quot;Oranje&quot; player, 4–1 to Finland, 4–0 to Belgium, 6–1 to Sweden and 3–1 to Switzerland.

==Coaching career==
===Early years in the Netherlands, Ajax, and Barcelona===

Michels returned to Ajax as head coach in 1965. Under his tenure and along with great players such as Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens, Ajax went from relegation candidates to a team that won the national championship four times and the KNVB Cup three times in the following six years. In 1969, they reached the final of the European Cup for the first time, being defeated 4–1 by Italian side Milan. In 1971, he managed Ajax to the first of three consecutive European Cups, a feat only achieved previously by the great Real Madrid team of Alfredo Di Stéfano and Ferenc Puskás. While at Ajax, Michels modernized the game by introducing what became known as &quot;Total Football&quot; and using the Offside trap. He then moved to Barcelona in the second part of 1971, being joined by Johan Cruyff in 1973. With Michels and Cruyff, the team won the Primera División title in 1974, before Michels became manager of the Dutch national team.

===1974 World Cup===
Michels was appointed national coach by the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) after the Netherlands had qualified for the 1974 FIFA World Cup. His first game as the Netherlands&#x27; coach was on 27 March 1974 in a 1–1 draw against Austria. At the finals tournament in Germany, their third ever World Cup participation, the Dutch impressed many observers with their style of play which was backed up by their results; they won their first round group, then in the second round group they defeated Argentina and the defending world champions Brazil, and reached the final after five wins and one draw, with 14 goals scored and only one conceded in six matches. At that point, Michels was undefeated in nine matches as the Netherlands&#x27; coach. The Netherlands scored first against West Germany in the final, but the host team came back to defeat them 2–1, ending their run. That match was the last of Michels&#x27; first tenure in charge of the Dutch team, which he would return to coach ten years later.

===Later years===

Michels later moved on to the United States where he coached in the ill-fated North American Soccer League. He ended his club coaching career with Bayer Leverkusen in 1989. He had his &quot;jour de gloire&quot;, however, when he coached the Dutch team to European glory at the 1988 UEFA European Championship.

===European champions===

Michels returned to coach the team for the Euro 1988 tournament. After losing the first group match against the Soviet Union (1–0), the Netherlands went on to qualify for the semi-final by defeating England 3–1 (with a hat-trick by the tournament&#x27;s top scorer Marco van Basten), and the Republic of Ireland (1–0). For many Dutch football supporters, the most important match in the tournament was the semi-final against West Germany, the host country, considered a revenge for the lost 1974 World Cup final (also in West Germany). Michels said after the match, &quot;We won the tournament, but we all know that the semi-final was the real final.&quot; Van Basten, who would later become national team coach, scored in the 89th minute of the game to sink the German side. The game is also remembered for its post-match shenanigans, including Ronald Koeman, who, in front of the German supporters, provocatively pretended to wipe his backside with the shirt of Olaf Thon as if it were toilet paper, an action Koeman later did not regret. The Netherlands won the final with a convincing victory over the Soviet Union, a rematch on the round robin game, through a header by Ruud Gullit and a remarkable volley by Van Basten. This was the national team&#x27;s first, and to date only, major tournament win and it restored them to the forefront of international football after almost a decade in the wilderness for almost three years to come.

==Death==
Michels died on 3 March 2005 at a hospital in Aalst, Belgium, after a heart surgery in the hospital of Gareth, Spain (his second since 1986).

==Style of management, personality and legacy==

Regarded as one of the greatest managers of all time, Rinus Michels&#x27;s tactics and &quot;Total football&quot; philosophy were influenced by his time playing under English manager Jack Reynolds at Ajax, who had implemented a similar playing style with the club to great success in the 1940s. When Michels himself later became manager of Ajax in 1965, he further developed this style around the team&#x27;s main forward Johan Cruyff. Although Cruyff was seemingly fielded as centre forward, Michels encouraged Cruyff to roam freely around the pitch, using his technical ability, creativity, and intelligence to exploit the weaknesses in the opposition and create space and chances in addition to scoring goals. Cruyff&#x27;s teammates also supported him by playing him in a similar manner, regularly switching positions to ensure that the tactical roles in the team were consistently filled. This role has retroactively been compared to the &quot;false 9&quot; position in contemporary football. Michels&#x27;s favoured formation was the 4–3–3.

The major component of total football was the use of space, and the need to consistently create it. Former Ajax defender Barry Hulshoff described it as &quot;[the thing] we discussed the whole time. Cruyff always talked about where to run and where to stand, and when not to move&quot;. He further elaborated that position switching was only made possible due to apt spatial awareness. He also described Total Football being proactive, as well as highlighting the use of pressing, which would be used to win back the ball or put the opposition under considerable pressure. Another aspect of the system was the use of the offside trap. Under Michels&#x27;s system, Ajax enjoyed a highly successful period, winning four Eredivisie titles, three KNVB Cups, and one European Cup.

The rise of Total Football and its attacking qualities were also linked with the demise of the more defensive–minded &quot;Catenaccio&quot;, a system reliant heavily on man-marking and counter–attacking, which was promoted most prominently by Italian sides Internazionale and Milan during the 1960s under Helenio Herrera and Nereo Rocco respectively. Unlike previous systems, in &quot;Total Football&quot;, no out–field player was fixed in their nominal role, which exposed weaknesses in the &quot;catenaccio&quot; tactical system; any player could assume the role of a forward, midfielder, or defender, at any given time depending on the circumstances. Due to players often switching positions with one another, man-marking strategies, such as &quot;catenaccio&quot;, were no longer effective at coping with this highly fluid tactical system. Despite previously losing out 4–1 to Milan in the 1969 European Cup Final, who were managed by Rocco, a manager known for his defensive catenaccio strategy, in 1971, Michels&#x27;s Ajax won the European Cup Final, defeating Panathinaikos 2–0, using &quot;Total Football&quot;. The following year, Michels&#x27;s successor at Ajax, Ștefan Kovács, continued to use Michels&#x27;s &quot;Total Football&quot; philosophy, and defeated Inter 2–0 in the European Cup final; Dutch newspapers subsequently announced the &quot;destruction of &quot;Catenaccio&quot;&quot; at the hands of &quot;Total Football&quot;. The following year, Ajax defeated Cesare Maldini&#x27;s Milan 6–0 in the second leg of the European Super Cup, in a match in which the defensive &quot;catenaccio&quot; system employed by Milan was unable to stop Ajax, which saw the Dutch side win the title 6–1 on aggregate; this was the worst defeat for an Italian team in an UEFA competition final.

Total football also had some weaknesses, however, which were notably exploited in the final of the 1974 FIFA World Cup by West Germany. Michels and Cruyff saw their ability to introduce playmaking stifled in the second half of the match by the effective marking of Berti Vogts. This allowed Franz Beckenbauer, Uli Hoeneß, and Wolfgang Overath to gain a stronghold in midfield, thus, enabling West Germany to win 2–1. Moreover, as man-marking alone was insufficient to cope with the fluidity of &quot;total football&quot;, Italian coaches consequently began to create a new tactical system that mixed man-marking with zonal defence in order to counter this strategy, which came to be known as &quot;zona mista&quot; (&quot;mixed zone,&quot; in Italian), or &quot;gioco all&#x27;italiana&quot; (&quot;gameplay in the Italian manner,&quot; in Italian), in Italian football, as it mixed elements of Italian &quot;catenaccio&quot; (man-marking) with elements of &quot;total football&quot; (zonal marking), with Giovanni Trapattoni as one its main and most successful proponents from the 1970s onward.

Michels became known as someone keen on his money and did not want to spend much of it. A common joke in the Ajax changing rooms in those days was, &quot;Does anybody know the color of Michels&#x27; wallet?&quot;. His IQ was high. During foreign trips he always brought a book with him, which he wanted to have read completely before coming home. He was known as someone who did not need anybody and who felt happy on his own, but sometimes he joined his teammates and shared their enthusiastic friendships. At the celebrations of Ajax&#x27; 50th birthday in 1950, he was the organizer of the humoristic show that was held and during traditional parties, he and his friend Hans Boskamp climbed up the stages to sing some duets. After matches, he was always soaping his hot body down in the showers of the changing rooms as well, even when the game was lost.

Michels was also known as a practical joker. At a hotel, he once borrowed a fur coat of a lady and pretended to be a lady to his teammates. During a training session in Lille, the players went fishing and Michels, who did not enjoy himself, jumped into the water.

Due to his authoritarian style as coach, Michels was called &quot;The General&quot;. He said, &quot;Professional football is something like war. Whoever behaves too properly, is lost.&quot; This has often been misquoted as &quot;Football is war.&quot; Michels felt the quote was taken out of context as he did not intend to equate war with football. Michels was named coach of the century by FIFA in 1999. In 2007 he was named the greatest post-war football coach by &quot;The Times&quot;, and in 2019, he was listed as the greatest coach in the history of football by France Football&quot;.

The Rinus Michels Award, which rewards the best managers in Dutch football, is named in his honour.

The station was launched at midnight on 1 January 1993, replacing previous broadcaster Television South, and is owned and operated by ITV plc, under the licensee of ITV Broadcasting Limited. Meridian Broadcasting Ltd was one of several (but not all) ITV plc-owned regional companies to have its legal name changed on 29 December 2006, when it became ITV Meridian Ltd. This company is, along with most other regional companies owned by ITV plc, listed with Companies House as a &quot;Dormant company&quot;.

The company broadcasts to the region from transmitters at Hannington, Midhurst, Rowridge, Whitehawk Hill, Hastings, Heathfield, Tunbridge Wells, Bluebell Hill, Dover and, since 2015, Oxford (previously part of the ITV Central region), as well as associated relays.

Today, ITV Meridian operates from studios in Whiteley, Hampshire, producing regional news services for three sub-regions, covering the South Coast of England, the South East of England and the Thames Valley.

==History==
===Formation===
ITV Meridian was formed as Meridian Broadcasting in 1991. The company consisted of a consortium between Mills &amp; Allen International (MAI), Selectv (15%) and Central Independent Television (20%), the latter of whom advised the consortium. Central Independent Television, along with Selectv, were instrumental in winning the franchise as a low bidder. Meridian Broadcasting intended to operate as a publisher broadcaster, meaning that the majority of programmes would be commissioned from independent producers rather than produced in-house.

In the ITV franchise auction of 1991, Meridian Broadcasting faced three other opponents in gaining the franchise, including the incumbent Television South and bids from Carlton Communications and CPV-TV. Meridian Broadcasting bid £36.5 million for the franchise, lower than TVS&#x27;s bid of £59.8 million; however, the bid made by TVS was rejected following an unsatisfactory business plan. As the highest qualified bidder, Meridian Broadcasting therefore won the franchise.

===Launch===
Meridian Broadcasting took over from Television South at stroke of midnight on New Year&#x27;s Day (1 January) 1993.

At the stroke of midnight, following Westminster clock tower chimes, technicians switched from Television South to the programme &quot;Meridian – The First 10 Minutes&quot;, a 10-minute outside broadcast from Winchester Cathedral presented by Debbie Thrower and previewing the station&#x27;s forthcoming output.

Other launch day programmes included Michael Palin&#x27;s documentary &quot;First Night on Meridian&quot; and the first &quot;Meridian News&quot; bulletins for its three sub-regions. Meridian advertised their presence as the new ITV contractor heavily; promotions began appearing on TVS several weeks before the launch and the new company&#x27;s logo was also incorporated into the product for the first advert shown on the station – the special edition Ford Fiesta Meridian, available through Southern Ford dealers.

===Post-launch===
Six months after the launch of Meridian Broadcasting, the new company joined up with HTV, Westcountry Television, Channel Television and S4C to form a joint advertising company operated by Meridian Broadcasting and HTV.

Shortly after, MAI began to expand by buying Anglia Television, the ITV franchise for the east of England, in 1994. The following year, MAI became a major shareholder in the consortium that won the franchise for Channel 5. In 1996, MAI merged with United Newspapers (via an agreed takeover by United) to form United News &amp; Media (UNM). The resulting company owned the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper, Meridian Broadcasting, Anglia Television, and a large shareholding (through the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot;) in Yorkshire Tyne Tees Television, the owners of Yorkshire Television and Tyne Tees Television. The stake in Yorkshire Tyne Tees Television was sold to Granada Television, allowing them to take control of the two franchises in 1997. United News &amp; Media later agreed to buy Scottish Television&#x27;s 20% stake in HTV and on 28 June 1997, HTV was taken over fully by UNM for £370 million.

In 1999, plans emerged of a merger between UNM and rival Carlton Television; however, these talks failed when it appeared that Meridian Broadcasting would have to be sold off as a condition of the deal. As a result, the television assets of UNM were sold to Granada; however, due to regulations stating that the company could not control that large an audience share, the broadcasting arm of HTV was sold to Carlton Television in exchange for the 20% stake that Central Independent Television held in Meridian Broadcasting.

===ITV Meridian===
In 2002, Granada Television and Carlton Television decided to consolidate the separate brandings for the ITV franchises that they controlled, changing the name of the region to ITV Meridian, with the on screen name of ITV1 used before all non-regional programming. The consolidation became further pronounced when Carlton Television and Granada Television merged to form ITV plc in 2004. 2004 also saw the move of ITV Meridian from their previous Northam studio complex to a new studio base in Whiteley, Hampshire.

In the subsequent years, ITV Meridian&#x27;s workforce has been condensed slowly with its operations considerably downgraded. This came to a head when Michael Grade announced his intention to reduce the number of regional programmes from 17 to 9. As part of these plans, which were approved by Ofcom in 2008, the three editions of the news programme &quot;Meridian Tonight&quot; were replaced with a single edition with a pre-recorded opt out for either the South or South East of the region. The plans resulted in over half of Meridian&#x27;s existing staff being made redundant; all employees wishing to remain with the company were obliged to re-apply for jobs. Some staff opted for voluntary redundancy and many others have been left without jobs. Strike action was threatened as a result of the announcement.

At present the only local programming that ITV Meridian provides for the region is regional news programming and a pan-regional monthly late-night 30-minute political discussion programme, &quot;The Last Word&quot;. In 2013 proposals were approved by Ofcom that reversed the 2009 consolidation of ITV Meridian&#x27;s regional news programmes, resulting in the reinstatement of the three sub-regions (South, East and Thames Valley). However to maintain lower costs, the main half-hour programme at 6p.m. contains a minimum 20 minutes of regional news (10 minutes in the Thames Valley) and daily use of &quot;shared content&quot; from outside the region. The practice of broadcasting one programme live and pre-recording others, using the same presenting team and studio set, continues.

==Studios==

When Meridian originally won the franchise in 1991, its plans were to purchase buildings, not unlike its current arrangement today: with a small studio for continuity and local news. This was planned because, being a publisher-broadcaster, it did not plan to make any programmes itself, instead buying in programmes from independent production companies. However, when TVS lost its franchise, TVS&#x27; plans were to become an independent production company based at Vinters Park, Maidstone, site of the former TVS South East division. Meridian took the opportunity to buy the Southampton studios from TVS.
Meridian did put these studios to good use in the future; on some occasions, Meridian would hire its studios out to the independent companies to use for the programmes, and, under the ownership of United News &amp; Media, some Channel 5 programmes were made there. However, as a publisher-broadcaster, the facilities were generally too big for Meridian. By 2004, ITV plc had decided that regional programming would be phased out in the years to come. In 2004, Meridian closed their Northam studios and moved to a unit in a business park in Whiteley. These new headquarters at Forum One, Solent Business Park, contained a newsroom plus the main technical production and transmission arms of the programmes including three small news studios.

In the summer of 2008, Meridian&#x27;s former studios at Southampton started to be dismantled, with plans to build a multi-storey block of flats in its place. In December 2010, the site was still lying derelict after developer Oakdene fell into administration in 2009.

Over the weekend of 22–23 October 2011, ITV Meridian moved to new premises in Fusion Three, on the same business park at Whiteley and across the road from its previous office. The new headquarters are again located in a conventional office building, and include two small studios, one of which is used for &quot;ITV News Meridian&quot;. The other is used for weather forecasts for the three sub-regions. The move was due to the cancellation of the lease at its former Whiteley premises.

In addition to Meridian&#x27;s Southampton headquarters, the company operated other studios and news bureaux. Upon launch, the South East output came from The Maidstone Studios before moving to a purpose-built studio centre at New Hythe near Maidstone in Kent in 1994. Following the move of the studio to Whiteley, the complex closed with a south-east newsroom with producers and reporters being moved back to The Maidstone Studios. Additionally, Meridian originally opened and operated a new studio complex at Newbury for its Meridian West operation. This closed in 2001, when the studio was moved to Southampton.

==Sub-regions==
When Meridian launched, it divided its news operations into three separate sub regions. These regions were served by their version of news programme &quot;Meridian Tonight&quot;, presented by an individual team of presenters from a studio within the sub region. These regions were:
* Meridian South, serving central and eastern Dorset, the Isle of Wight, the majority of West Sussex, the Brighton &amp; Hove coastal conurbation of East Sussex, southern Hampshire and southern Wiltshire. Initially broadcast from Meridian&#x27;s Southampton headquarters.
* Meridian East, serving East Sussex, Kent, southern Essex and parts of West Sussex. Initially broadcast from The Maidstone Studios, before moving to New Hythe in 1994.
* Meridian North, serving Berkshire, northern Hampshire, northern Wiltshire and parts of Surrey. Initially broadcast from Newbury.

The services remained without major modification until 2001 when the Newbury complex was closed and the Meridian West studio operation was moved to the Southampton headquarters; Newsgathering remained the same as previously. When the company moved to Whiteley in 2004, presentation of all three editions of &quot;Meridian Tonight&quot; moved with the company, resulting in the closure of the New Hythe studio base, although newsgathering in the south-east was unaffected as journalists and reporters moved back to the Maidstone Studios. Despite this move not being uncommon in the broadcasting industry, some considered the move controversial, particularly as the Meridian South East programme would be presented 60 miles from the nearest part of the South East region and 160 miles from its furthest point.

On 4 December 2006, the Meridian West and Central South sub regions were merged to form the non-broadcast region ITV Thames Valley. This new service was broadcast from Whiteley, using Central&#x27;s Abingdon base as the main newsgathering centre.

Under cost-cutting plans announced by ITV in September 2007 and agreed to by the UK&#x27;s broadcasting regulator Ofcom in October 2008, the region&#x27;s three sub-regions would be replaced with one programme. This new programme would be split between the South East and a combined South/Thames Valley region for the first half of the programme, and joined as one for the remainder of the programme. One of the opt out segments would be pre-recorded depending on the regions news. The new programme began on 9 February 2009, presented by Sangeeta Bhabra and Fred Dinenage. Pan-regional bulletins including morning ones during &quot;Daybreak&quot;, which are branded &quot;Daybreak Meridian News&quot;, are also used in the region. The sub-regions retain their own local advertisements.

In 2013, following a network wide rebrand of ITV, the long-standing &quot;Meridian Tonight&quot; brand was retired and replaced by &quot;ITV News Meridian&quot;. On 23 July 2013, proposals to reintroduce some elements of the sub-regional services were approved by Ofcom. As a result, &quot;ITV News Meridian&quot; now also produces separate breakfast, lunchtime and weekend bulletins for the South and South East with opt-outs within the main 6pm programme extended slightly to 20 minutes. In the former Thames Valley region, plans were also approved for a ten-minute opt out within the 6pm programme for the south of England and a full late night bulletin on weekdays after &quot;News at Ten&quot;.

==Identity==

During Meridian&#x27;s years as an independent broadcaster their on-screen idents typically featured a form-up of their logo. From their launch this featured an exploding mix of orange, yellow and blue, which came together to form the distinctive sun/moon face logo. The unusual logo design was reportedly inspired by maritime images (the sun/moon face is a recurring feature on compasses, sextants and other nautical artefacts used in the navigation of ships), appropriately reflecting the south&#x27;s long seafaring history. The name &quot;Meridian&quot;, which derives from the Latin &quot;meridionālis&quot; meaning &quot;of the south&quot;, may also be linked to the Prime Meridian (the boundary between the Western and Eastern Hemispheres of the globe, and a key landmark in the measurement of time), which passes through the middle of the region, although this has not been confirmed.

On 2 September 1996, this ident was replaced by one with a deep purple/blue background and an emphasis on the deep colours of the logo, as well as a smoother form-up. This ident was replaced on 5 October 1998 by one with a yellow background and featuring a small ITV logo underneath the Meridian name. On 8 November 1999, the emphasis was on the network&#x27;s hearts logo, with a very small Meridian logo only featuring at the end of the form-up. This look was in use until October 2002 when ITV1 in England and Wales abandoned local continuity and idents. The only exceptions were ITV1 idents shown before regional programming, which featured the word &quot;Meridian&quot; below the ITV1 logo. However, even this did not last, and only a few years later these regional idents were dropped. Meridian for a while managed to retain some identity by featuring their (sun/moon face) logo on the local weather forecast, as well as the news desk of &quot;Meridian News&quot; and &quot;Meridian Tonight&quot;. However, the logo was completely removed in 2004, last seen at the start of the late-night weather forecast on 5 December 2004. On 1 February 2005, it was replaced with a generic &quot;ITV Meridian&quot; logo, the official name of the franchise.
Since 2006, all idents have been generic to the entire network with no difference between regions and only the ITV1 name being used. On 14 January 2013, the station&#x27;s on-air identity was changed to ITV, along with all other ITV plc-owned franchises. 
From September 2014, however, Meridian&#x27;s identity was revived by an announcement (including the sub-region) immediately prior to the evening edition of &quot;ITV Meridian News&quot;.

==Programming==
Meridian Broadcasting was originally intended to function as a publisher-broadcaster, commissioning most programmes from independent producers and with in-house production largely restricted to regional news, sport and current affairs. However, over time and as its ownership changed, Meridian began to make a number of regional and networked programmes itself. As its parent company MAI became a significant shareholder in Channel 5, Meridian supplied a number of the new channel&#x27;s programmes for the network such as sports programme &quot;Turnstyle&quot;, youth programme &quot;The Mag&quot; and children&#x27;s show &quot;Havakazoo&quot;.

Meridian also geared a large amount of its network output towards younger viewers, with independent commissions including &quot;Wizadora&quot; for pre-school children, plus &quot;ZZZap!, The Ruth Rendell Mysteries, It&#x27;s a Mystery, The Vanishing Man, Jane Austen&#x27;s Emma, William and Mary&quot; and &quot;Eye of the Storm&quot; for older children. Drama became a successful genre for the station, with Peter Kosminsky&#x27;s &quot;No Child of Mine&quot;, tackling the emotionally difficult subject of child abuse, winning Meridian a BAFTA award. Meridian presents Mary Wesley&#x27;s two novels: &quot;Harnessing Peacocks&quot; and &quot;The Vacillations of Poppy Carew&quot;. Later, the same production team tackled vicious childhood bullying in &quot;Walking on the Moon&quot;. Meridian&#x27;s two-part production &quot;In the Name of Love&quot; in 1999 starred Tara Fitzgerald, Tim Dutton and Mark Strong, and was written by Sarah-Louise Hawkins and directed by Ferdinand Fairfax. &quot;Hornblower&quot; was a Sunday night success for the ITV network while another Sunday night favourite, &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot;, transferred production from Anglia Television to Meridian in 2002 – the station&#x27;s last major contribution at a network level.

<doc id="756073" wikidata="Q2612365" url="?curid=756073" title="Whiteley">
<text>Whiteley is a planned community of 6,500 homes in the county of Hampshire, England, United Kingdom near Fareham. The development straddles the boundary between two council districts: the Borough of Fareham to the south and west, and the City of Winchester to the north and east.

==Location==
Whiteley is located in southern Hampshire between the cities of Portsmouth and Southampton and close to the market town of Fareham. The development is situated close to Junction 9 of the M27 motorway. Rail services are provided from Swanwick railway station to the south - services between London Victoria/Portsmouth and Southampton via Hamble, or Botley railway station to the north - services between London Waterloo and Portsmouth via Eastleigh. Cycle tracks interconnect the town with the two stations, and a Bus 28a connects to Swanwick and on to Fareham Bus Station.

==History==
Historically, the site now occupied by Whiteley was farmland and coppice. The nearest historical settlements are those of Park Gate situated just south of Swanwick Hill, Little Park to the South, Swanwick to the West, Botley and Curdridge to the North. 
Farm land taken over by the initial development included Rookery, Yew Tree, Sweethills and Whiteley. North Whiteley development was based on land released by Bury, Bridge and Barn Farms. Barn Farmhouse which remains in North Whiteley is listed by Historic England as a C17 timber frame house with a C18 extension. 

The wooded areas in Whiteley were used to provide shelter to troops in the build-up of forces for transportation to northern France in preparation for D-Day during the second world war. This is evidenced by the remains of a War Department water tank on the edge of the Bere Forest to the north of the community.

Part of the M27 motorway constructed to the south of the development was opened in February 1978.

In the early 1980s Hampshire County Council developed draft proposals for land north of what was then known as the western wards of Fareham. The new community was to be known as Whiteley after the name of the farm that lay in the centre of the development area. This development comprised 3,300 houses 16,500 m2 of offices and 7,500 m2 of retail, plus a community centre and a junior school.

Construction of the Solent business park started in the mid-1980s and the first houses were completed in the late 1980s, although construction slowed for a few years following a crash in the British residential property market during the mid-1990s. From 1996 construction recommenced and continues today.

One of the earliest buildings in Whiteley was the Solent Hotel and Spa which was constructed in the early 1990s.

In September 2007, British Land announced plans to spend upwards of £100m redeveloping Whiteley Village and reconstructing it as a district centre, while also adding housing and a hotel to the area.

The Whiteley village Outlet was demolished in Autumn 2011 (finishing by November 2011), with the exception of the medium-sized Tesco supermarket.

The new development was opened in 2013.

In July 2018 Winchester District Council approved an outline planning application for a further development, North Whiteley consisting of 3,500 residences with provision for 2 junior schools and a senior school, plus 3 new routes linking Whiteley to Botley Road. This development should be largely complete by 2027.

The part of the development which falls in the Winchester district became a civil parish in 2003.

Whiteley was recognised as a Parish in Portsmouth Diocese in 2021. Hope Church Whiteley began as the town first became established about 25 years ago, within people&#x27;s homes. It moved to the Community Centre in Gull Coppice before, in 2021, it moved to its new building at Cornerstone School. It is a multicultural, intergenerational church.

==Whiteley today==

Apart from the residential areas, which house around 10,000 residents, the main focus is the Whiteley Shopping Centre, an open air pedestrianised mall https://www.whiteleyshopping.co.uk/ (not to be confused with &#x27;Whiteley Village&#x27; in Walton-on-Thames). Stores include Marks &amp; Spencer, Next plc, Boots, WH Smith and many other common High Street names but there are also other units that were specifically earmarked for local enterprises. Parking is available for 1500 vehicles and is free for the first 4 hours and after 6pm. In 2015 a new leisure complex adjacent to Whiteley Shopping opened, providing a nine-screen cinema and a further five restaurants.

Whiteley also contains the Solent Business Park which consists of a number of large companies, including Zurich Financial Services, the new headquarters for NATS (formerly National Air Traffic Services) and the offices and studios of ITV Meridian. Development at the business park continues as further offices are constructed.

==Whiteley New Town Issues==

• The town started with a business park, a hotel and an outlet centre spurred off junction 9 of the M27. The single entrance and exit road resulted in start and end of day traffic jams. 
A lengthy set of traffic mitigation schemes has been implemented, but the resultant roadworks have lasted over 10 years and problems with access to the M27 continue while the roadworks are ongoing.

• The new development includes a set of roads (Bluebell, Curbridge and Whiteley Way) which are designed as low speed through routes to Botley Road A3051. The roads are owned by the housing development companies of North Whiteley, which results in legal issues, as they are not yet roads adopted and managed by Hampshire County Council.

• The bus service laid out in the Framework Travel plan for the new town has not been delivered. Current service is roughly hourly, roughly daytime, where it was planned as a 20 minute more extensive service connecting through to both Hedge End and Fareham.

• The continued development of properties in North Whiteley and resultant groundworks results in noise, dust, mud and traffic. The contractors utilise road cleaning vehicles to mitigate the dust, but with limited success.

• Management of parts of communal spaces was allocated to management companies by the developers. Local residents need to monitor and control the fees charged by these management companies.

• Mobile signal in the area is notoriously poor, especially in the central area around the retail centre.

• The local GP surgery (Meon Health Practice) has faced staffing versus demand issues, resulting in &#x27;Emergency Appointments only&#x27; in the last 2 months of 2024. Parking at the GP surgery is constrained by the ancient woodlands.

• Secondary school children need to commute to Henry Cort School (1 hour walking distance). Hampshire&#x27;s application to build a new secondary school within Whiteley Town is under consideration and will, if approved, mitigate this problem from 2027 onward.

• The new build has threatened to displace local species. Mitigation efforts such as Bat Boxes, Hedgehog houses and Bird Boxes were implemented by the developers as required by Winchester District Council. These biodiverse green spaces now need to be protected and maintained in the long term by the Town Council.

==Whiteley Copses and Woodland==

Whiteley is bordered on the East by public woodlands managed by Forestry England, leading up to Botley Wood and Everett&#x27;s and Mushes Copses. Botley Wood is run by Hampshire County Council.

The town is constructed around a number of smaller woodland copses and coppices. These include:
Round Coppice between Solent Hotel and Village Centre;
Hill Coppice between Business Park and M27;
Coldland Copse south of Ridge Lane;
Coldland Meadow north of Barn Owl Close;
Suttons Copse west of Ridge Lane;
Bedlams Copse between Ridge Lane and Bluebell Way;
Hangman&#x27;s Copse between Bluebell Way and Botley Road;
Quavey&#x27;s Copse south west of Bluebell Way;
Glassfield Copse west of Bluebell Way;
Round Copse north of Bluebell Way;
Sawpit Copse between Bluebell Way and Whiteley Way;
Bushy Land inside Sweethill Crescent;
Gull Coppice between Yew Tree Drive and Meadowside, and 
Yew Tree Woodland Park south of Yew Tree Drive.

==Demographics==
The development has an overwhelmingly young population (79% under 44 years), white (96.95%), home-owning (87.23%) population of professionals and aspirational skilled workers (80% in social grade AB and C1). Whiteley is reported by the local health authority to have a higher than average rate of divorce and separation (11% versus 6% nationally).

Its higher education awards are validated by the University of the West of England, and its students graduate alongside members of UWE Bristol&#x27;s Faculty of Arts, Creative Industries and Education. It is a member of the Federation of Drama Schools.

==History==
The School opened in October 1946, eight months after the founding of its parent Bristol Old Vic Theatre Company, in a room above a fruit merchant&#x27;s warehouse in the Rackhay near the stage door of the Theatre Royal, with support from Sir Laurence Olivier. (The yard of the derelict St Nicholas School, next to the warehouse, was still used by the Company for rehearsals of crowd scenes and stage fights as late as the early 1960s, such as for John Hale&#x27;s productions of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; starring the Canadian actor Paul Massie and Annette Crosbie, a former student of the School, and Rostand&#x27;s&quot; Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; with Peter Wyngarde. Students from the Theatre School frequently played in these crowd scenes and fights.)

The School continued in these premises for eight years because of the Old Vic&#x27;s lack of funds in the post-war decade until 1954 when the Company produced a small-scale end-of season topical musical for the entertainment of regular patrons and to allow the actors to &#x27;let their hair down&#x27; after a season of mainly serious productions.

This musical, &quot;Salad Days&quot; by Julian Slade and Dorothy Reynolds, proved very popular with Bristol audiences and was subsequently transferred to London&#x27;s West End where it was an instant hit and played for more than four years, making it the longest running production in West End history at the time. £7,000 from the &quot;Salad Days&quot; profits – a large sum in those days— was given to the School towards the purchase and conversion of two large adjoining Victorian villas at 1 and 2 Downside Road in Clifton. In 1995, the enduring benefit to students of that donation was formally recognised when a new custom-built dance and movement studio in the School&#x27;s back garden was named the &quot;Slade/Reynolds Studio&quot;.

Many members of the theatrical profession have taught at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. This included was Rudi Shelly, who joined the teaching staff only two weeks after the School opened in 1946 and was still working into his nineties. Alumni from around the world gathered in Bristol for his funeral at which the eulogy was delivered by alumna Stephanie Cole. Apart from students of the School, over the years many established actors from around the world sought out Rudi Shelly&#x27;s master classes when visiting or working in England.

At the time of the School&#x27;s move to its current premises in Downside Road, Clifton, in 1956, the Principal was Duncan (Bill) Ross, who had succeeded the first Principal, Edward Stanley in 1954. After guiding the School through seven difficult years that are nonetheless still regarded by his former students as a golden age, Ross left in late 1961 to take up a teaching post in the USA. Soon after the departure of this much-loved principal, other key staff members resigned, including Daphne Heard and Maggie Collins, and Paula Gwyn-Davies, the School Secretary.

After a short interregnum under the actor Richard Ainley, in 1963 the post of Principal was taken by Nat Brenner, a distinguished actor and theatre technician and, at that time, general manager of the Bristol Old Vic Theatre. Brenner&#x27;s stewardship was regarded by students of the time as another golden age. He remained in the post until 1980, when he was succeeded by Christopher Denys, who retired in the summer of 2007 to be replaced by Paul Rummer as Principal and Sue Wilson in the new post of Artistic Director. Paul Rummer retired in 2020 and was succeeded by Fiona Francombe, previously the director of Bristol&#x27;s Bottle Yard Studios. Until 1989 the Theatre School was part of the Bristol Old Vic Company, but it is now a financially independent organisation.

On the 6th January 2025, the school announced it would no longer be accepting applications for undergraduate degree programmes, and not admitting any new undergraduate students from September 2025. The school will &quot;continue delivering our distinct suite of intensive postgraduate courses and exciting, accessible short courses&quot;, blaming the change on financial issues caused by increasing costs and decreasing income as faced by other institutions. 

==Courses==
In 2007, the theatre school accepted 28 people out of approximately 2,500 applications per year for the three-year BA acting course, making it one of the most selective drama schools in the world.
Applicants are judged purely on talent in two rounds of intensive auditions.
It has its own premises in Clifton, bought with proceeds from the London success of &quot;Salad Days&quot;.
It previously had working links with the Drama Department of the University of Bristol, which still holds many papers of the Theatre School in its Theatre Collection. For many years it presented regular student productions in the Department&#x27;s experimental Drama Studio converted from an indoor tennis court off a corridor in the Wills Memorial Building behind the University&#x27;s Bell Tower at the top of Bristol&#x27;s fashionable Park Street. Students from the School and the Drama Department shared many of each other&#x27;s formal lectures and a number of the Department&#x27;s graduates went on to continue their studies as full-time students at the School.

Having struggled with limited resources until the 1960s, the School now has access to several local performance venues, including the Redgrave Theatre at Clifton College (named after the actor Sir Michael Redgrave, an old boy of the College) the Bristol Old Vic theatre complex, including the Theatre Royal, Weston Studio and Circomedia in Portland Square. It also takes productions on tour to locations in the West Country, a tradition dating back to the 1950s when for several years students moved to Dartington Hall in South Devon for two weeks each spring where they rehearsed and presented a public production in the Barn Theatre. The School was able to use broadcasting studio facilities at the University Drama Studio for radio drama training in the 1950s and also ran occasional courses in conjunction with the BBC at their Bristol Studios in Whiteladies Road. In 2002, the Theatre School bought the former BBC Christchurch radio studios in Clifton and has further developed the facilities there which include sound studios and sound and video editing suites which are used by students and also by music and media industry clients. The school has scenic workshops in Bedminster used by the technical courses.

As well as actors, the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School also provides comprehensive training courses for all theatre, radio, film, and television professionals.

Its graduates are to be found in key positions as actors, directors, set designers, costumer designers, lighting designers and stage and company managers throughout the world.

<text>Ugo Cavallero (20September 188013September 1943) was an Italian military commander before and during World War II. He was the first Chief of the 
&quot;Comando Supremo&quot; (Italian Supreme Command) on June 1941. He was dismissed from his command due to his lacklustre performance, and was arrested upon the fall of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s regime. Cavallero was later freed by the Germans, but refused to collaborate and was found dead the following day.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Born in Casale Monferrato, Piedmont, Cavallero had a privileged childhood as a member of the Italian nobility. After attending military school, Cavallero was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1900. Cavallero later attended college and graduated in 1911, earning a degree in mathematics. A man of vast culture, Cavallero was fluent in both German and English. Still in the army, Cavallero fought in Libya in 1913, during the Italo-Turkish War, and was awarded a Bronze Medal of Military Valor.

In 1907, Cavallero was initiated in the regular Masonic Lodge &quot;Dante Alighieri&quot; of Turin, which was affiliated to the Grand Orient of Italy. Subsequently, he become a member of the Scottish Rite Serenenissima Gran Loggia d&#x27;Italia located in Rome, where on 15 August 1918 he received the 33rd and highest degree.

===World War I===
In 1915, Cavallero was transferred to the Italian Supreme Command. A skilled organizer and tactician, Cavallero became a brigadier general and chief of the Operations Office of the Italian Supreme Command in 1918. In this capacity, Cavallero was instrumental in forming plans that led to Italian victories at Piave and Vittorio Veneto during World War I. During his time as chief of the plan of Italian General Staff, he developed an antipathy with Pietro Badoglio, the &quot;Sottocapo di Stato Maggiore&quot; (vice chief of the staff) of the army.

===Interwar period===
Cavallero retired from the army in 1919 but later rejoined in 1925, at which time he became Benito Mussolini’s undersecretary of war. A committed fascist, Cavallero was made a senator in 1926 and in 1927 became a major general. After leaving the army for a second time, Cavallero became involved in business and diplomatic enterprises throughout the late 1920s and early 1930s.

Cavallero rejoined the army for the third and final time in 1937. Promoted to lieutenant general, he became commander of the combined Italian forces in Italian East Africa in 1938 and was made a full general in 1940.

===World War II===
After Italy entered World War II, on 6 December 1940 Cavallero replaced Pietro Badoglio as Chief of the Defence Staff. Shortly after his appointment, Cavallero was sent to command the Italian forces involved in the unsuccessful Greco-Italian War until the spring of 1941. While he managed to halt the Greek advance, Cavallero was unable to break the stalemate until the German intervention. In the meantime, his role as Chief of Staff was filled by General Alfredo Guzzoni.

On 15 and 19 May 1941 Cavallero, submitted proposals for the &quot;Stato Maggiore&quot;″s complete reorganization to Mussolini. This was implemented in June. The &quot;Stato Maggiore Generale&quot; was redesignated &quot;Comando Supremo&quot;, made more efficient and transformed from a mere advisory body into a true military high command. Under Cavallero, the &quot;Comando Supremo&quot; maintained good relations with &quot;Oberbefehlshaber Süd&quot;, the command of German forces in Italy. Cavallero worked closely with German Field Marshal Albert Kesselring; however he had a rather conflicting relationship with Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, whose advance into Egypt after his success at the Battle of Gazala he opposed, advocating instead the planned invasion of Malta; his opinion, shared by Kesselring and Rintelen, was however discounted by Hitler and Mussolini. Cavallero was promoted to Marshal of Italy on 1 July 1942, soon after the promotion of Rommel to Field Marshal (largely to prevent Rommel from out-ranking him). Despite having a good grasp on the problems inherent to the war in the Mediterranean that Italy had to fight, his acquiescence to Mussolini&#x27;s views (for example his insistence on augmenting the Italian contingent fighting on the Eastern Front) led to a fatal dispersion of Italy&#x27;s meagre resources.

In January 1943, after the definitive loss of the African campaign and the setbacks suffered by the Italian Army in Russia, Cavallero was dismissed and replaced by General Vittorio Ambrosio. In response to Cavallero&#x27;s dismissal, members of the Fascist leadership like Galeazzo Ciano, openly hostile to him, openly expressed their satisfaction.

After Mussolini&#x27;s government was toppled by the King, the newly appointed Prime Minister Pietro Badoglio ordered the arrest of Cavallero. In a letter written in his own defence, Cavallero claimed he had opposed Mussolini and his regime. After the Armistice of Cassibile in September 1943, the Germans freed him. Kesselring offered Cavallero command of the forming armed forces of the Italian Social Republic, but the discovery of the letter led some to question his loyalty.

===Death===
In the morning of 14 September 1943, he was found dead by a gunshot in the garden of a hotel in Frascati, where he had dined and talked with Kesselring the night before. It is still up to debate whether he committed suicide or was assassinated by the Germans. It seems, however, that he firmly expressed his will to refuse to continue collaborating with the Germans.

<doc id="756083" wikidata="Q7379411" url="?curid=756083" title="Rumsfeld v. Padilla">
<text>Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. 426 (2004), was a United States Supreme Court case, in which José Padilla, an American citizen, sought &quot;habeas corpus&quot; relief against Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, as a result of his detention by the military as an &quot;unlawful combatant.&quot;

On May 8, 2002, Padilla, a U.S. citizen, flew from Pakistan to Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare International Airport. As he left the plane, Padilla was apprehended by federal agents executing a material witness warrant issued by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in connection with its grand jury investigation into the September 11th attacks by terrorists. Initially Padilla was considered a &quot;material witness,&quot; without charges filed and was given very limited access to legal counsel. He was later classified as an &quot;enemy combatant,&quot; which, the George W. Bush administration claimed as justification to imprison him indefinitely, and without legal recourse or access, as with non-citizen suspects in the war on terror.

Padilla&#x27;s attorney, Donna Newman, claiming to act as his next friend and on his behalf, filed a petition for &quot;habeas corpus&quot; in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On December 4, 2002, the court denied the petition and held that the President of the United States, as Commander-in-Chief had the authority to designate as an &quot;enemy combatant&quot; an American citizen captured on American soil, and, through the Secretary of Defense, to detain him for the duration of armed conflict with al-Qaida.

The case was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which held that the President lacked the authority to order the military detentions of American citizens captured on American soil.

The case was petitioned to the United States Supreme Court. The principal issue before the Court was whether the Congressional Authorization for Use of Military Force post September 11 gave the president the powers to detain a United States citizen under military custody by classifying the detainee as an &quot;enemy combatant.&quot; Otherwise, the president would run afoul of the Non-Detention Act, which provides that &quot;No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.

The Court did not decide the issue. Instead, the Court held that the &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition had been improperly filed. It ruled that because Padilla was being held in a brig (military prison) in South Carolina, the petition should have been filed in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina, and it should have named the commander of the brig and the Secretary of Defense since the brig commander was Padilla&#x27;s &quot;immediate custodian&quot;. The Court reversed the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and remanded the case for dismissal without prejudice. In other words, it overruled the Court of Appeals decision and ordered the dismissal of the case, allowing Padilla to refile the petition. Thus, the principal issue of the case had not been resolved.

Paul Clement, Principal Deputy Solicitor General at the time, gave oral argument for the United States (Rumsfeld); Jennifer Martinez, a law professor and human rights lawyer, gave oral argument on behalf of Padilla and Newman.

== Background ==
The case was argued only two days before the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal was first shown to the general public in a &quot;The New Yorker&quot; article by Seymour M. Hersh (April 30), which showed digital photos taken by guards. The story was subsequently taken up by CBS and broadcast on nationwide television.

The timing of the two events is relevant for understanding political context. Before the publicizing of incriminating photographs of abused detainees in Iraq, the US was largely dominated by a political climate in which the charge of abuse was only anecdotal and was weighed lightly compared to appeals for national security. Still, the rendered decision came after news of the scandal broke, and the degree of the Abu Ghraib case influence is speculative.

During the oral argument, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked some pointed questions of Clement, some of which directly treated the issue of abuse. An important dialogue features a comment by Deputy Solicitor General Paul Clement which denies the claim that the United States uses torture:

; Justice Ginsburg: Suppose the executive says mild torture, we think, will help get this information. It&#x27;s not a soldier who does something against the Code of Military Justice, but it&#x27;s an executive command. Some systems do that to get information.
; Clement: Well, our executive doesn&#x27;t. And I think, I mean...
; Justice Ginsburg: What&#x27;s constraining? That&#x27;s the point. Is it just up to the good will of the executive, or is there any judicial check?

<doc id="756084" wikidata="Q1383799" url="?curid=756084" title="John Gardner (British writer)">
<text>John Edmund Gardner (20 November 1926 – 3 August 2007) was an English writer of spy and thriller novels. He is best known for his James Bond continuation novels, but also wrote a series of Boysie Oakes books and three novels containing Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s fictional villain, Professor Moriarty. 

During the Second World War, Gardner joined the Home Guard at the age of 13, served in the Fleet Air Arm and subsequently joined the Royal Marines: he later described himself as &quot;the worst commando in the world&quot;. After demobilisation, he followed his father into the Church of England, studying theology at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and being ordained as a priest in 1953. After losing his faith, he left the church in 1958 and took a job as a drama critic at the &quot;Stratford-upon-Avon Herald.&quot; 

Gardner&#x27;s literary career began in 1964 with the autobiographical &quot;Spin the Bottle&quot;, which detailed his experience of alcoholism. In the same year, he published &quot;The Liquidator&quot;, a parody of James Bond in which the cowardly Boysie Oakes is mistakenly recruited as a British spy. The book was made into a film, and followed by and seven further Oakes novels and four short stories over the next eleven years. He subsequently wrote further novels centred on the characters of Derek Torry and Herbie Kruger, a Scotland Yard inspector and an intelligence agent respectively. From the mid 1970s onwards, he published three novels using the character of Professor Moriarty from the Sherlock Holmes series.

Between 1981 and 1996, Gardner wrote fourteen James Bond novels and the novelisations of two Bond films, at the invitation of Ian Fleming&#x27;s former production company, Glidrose Publications. Although commercially popular, his Bond novels were not a critical success: &quot;The Guardian&quot; considered them &quot;dogged by silliness&quot;. He ended his work on Bond following a diagnosis of oesophageal cancer in the 1990s, and took a break from writing altogether in 1997, following the unexpected death of his wife, Margaret Mercer. In 2000, he resumed his literary work, publishing &quot;Day of Absolution&quot; in 2001 and &quot;Bottled Spider&quot; in 2002&quot;.&quot; The latter work introduced Detective Sergeant Suzie Mountford, named after Gardner&#x27;s ex-fiancée, Patricia Mountford, who resumed her engagement with him after reading the book. He published a further four Suzie Mountford novels before his death in 2007, from suspected heart failure.

==Early life==
John Edmund Gardner was born on 20 November 1926 in Seaton Delaval, a village in Northumberland. His parents were Cyril Gardner, a London-born Anglican priest who had been ordained in Wallsend in 1921, and Lena Henderson, a local girl; the couple were married in 1925. In 1933 the family moved to the market town of Wantage in what was then Berkshire, where Cyril took up the position of Chaplain at St Mary&#x27;s, Wantage, and Gardner was educated at the local King Alfred&#x27;s School.

During the Second World War he joined the Home Guard, despite being only 13 at the time. Gardner subsequently served in the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm, before transferring to 42 Commando, Royal Marines, for service in the Middle and Far East. Gardner considered himself &quot;the worst commando in the world&quot; and, despite being &quot;a small-arms expert ... [who] also knew a lot about explosives&quot;, he admitted that &quot;I bent an aeroplane I was learning to fly&quot;.

After the war he went up to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, to study theology and was subsequently ordained as an Anglican priest in 1953. He realised that he had lost his faith and made an error in his career; he later admitted that during one sermon, &quot;I didn&#x27;t believe a word I was saying&quot;. He was released from the church in 1958 and took up a position as a drama critic with the &quot;Stratford-upon-Avon Herald&quot;. It was whilst at the &quot;Herald&quot;—aged 33—that Gardner realised he was an alcoholic, drinking two bottles of gin a day. He overcame his addiction and produced his first book as part of his therapy: the autobiographical &quot;Spin the Bottle&quot;, published in 1964. Critic and scholar John Sutherland says that of all the books Gardner published, it is &quot;the one that most deserves to survive.&quot;

==Writing career==
In 1964 Gardner began his novelist career with &quot;The Liquidator&quot;, in which he created the character Boysie Oakes who inadvertently is mistaken to be a tough, pitiless man of action and is thereupon recruited into a British spy agency. In fact, Oakes was a devout coward who was terrified of violence, suffered from airsickness and was afraid of heights and Gardner admitted of him that, &quot;though I have denied it many times—he was of course a complete piss-take of J. Bond&quot;. The book appeared at the height of the fictional spy mania and, as a send-up of the whole business, was an immediate success. Reviewing the novel in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Anthony Boucher wrote, &quot;Mr. Gardner succeeds in having it both ways: He has written a clever parody which is also a genuinely satisfactory thriller.&quot; The book was made into a film of the same name by MGM and another seven light-hearted novels and four short stories about the cowardly Oakes appeared over the next eleven years.

Following the success of his Oakes books, Gardner created new characters: Derek Torry—a Scotland Yard inspector of Italian descent—and Herbie Kruger, the latter of which appeared in a series of novels published simultaneously with his Bond works. In the mid-1970s Gardner also wrote the first of three novels using the character of Professor Moriarty from the Sherlock Holmes series, the last of which was published posthumously. The third of this series, titled simply &quot;Moriarty&quot;, was delayed due to a dispute with the publisher, but was finally released shortly after his death. Erik Lee Preminger bought the film rights to the first of the trilogy—&quot;The Return of Moriarty&quot;—and wrote a script. Edgar Bronfman Jr., for Sagittarius Entertainment and Nat Cohen, for EMI Productions were to produce. Donald Sutherland was to portray Moriarty. Funding however fell through shortly before filming was to begin.

In 1979 Glidrose Publications (now Ian Fleming Publications) approached Gardner and asked him to revive Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond series of novels. Between 1981 and 1996, Gardner wrote fourteen James Bond novels, and the novelizations of two Bond films. Gardner stated that he wanted &quot;to bring Mr Bond into the 1980s&quot;, although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them. Even though Gardner kept the ages the same, he made Bond grey at the temples as a nod to the passing of the years. With the influence of the American publishers, Putnam&#x27;s, the Gardner novels showed an increase in the number of Americanisms used in the book, such as a waiter wearing &quot;pants&quot;, rather than trousers, in &quot;The Man from Barbarossa&quot;. James Harker, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, considered that the Gardner books were &quot;dogged by silliness&quot;, giving examples of &quot;Scorpius&quot;, where much of the action is set in Chippenham, and &quot;Win, Lose or Die&quot;, where &quot;Bond gets chummy with an unconvincing Maggie Thatcher&quot;. Whilst Gardner&#x27;s Bond novels received a mixed reaction from the critics, they were popular and a number appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, bringing the author commercial success.

Gardner had an ambivalent view on being the Bond author, once saying &quot;I&#x27;m very grateful to have been selected to keep Bond alive. But I&#x27;d much rather be remembered for my own work than I would for Bond&quot;, while saying on another occasion that &quot;I remain proud that my contribution to the Bond saga played a great part in its development&quot;. In the mid-1990s, after discovering he had oesophageal cancer, Gardner officially retired from writing Bond novels and Glidrose Publications quickly chose Raymond Benson to continue the literary stories of James Bond.

His break from writing lasted for five years, following the death of his wife, but after battling his illness he returned to print in 2000 with a new novel, &quot;Day of Absolution&quot;. Gardner also began a series of books with a new character, Suzie Mountford, a 1930s police detective.

&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; crime critic Derrick Murdoch said, &quot;John Gardner is technically a highly competent thriller novelist who never seems to be quite at ease unless he is writing in the same vein as another writer. (He has worked John le Carré and Graham Greene this way, and it&#x27;s what makes him so well qualified to continue the James Bond saga.)&quot;

The Crime Writers&#x27; Association short-listed &quot;The Liquidator&quot;, &quot;The Dancing Dodo&quot;, &quot;The Nostradamus Traitor&quot;, and &quot;The Garden of Weapons&quot; for their annual Gold Dagger award.

==Personal life==
In 1952 Gardner married Margaret Mercer and the couple had two children, Simon and Alexis. Gardner also had another daughter, Miranda, the result of a long affair with Susan Wright, a former personal assistant to Peter Sellers. In 1989, Gardner and his family moved to the US and it was in America that he was diagnosed with cancer; firstly of the prostate and then, six years later, of the oesophagus. The subsequent medical treatment in the US left him near bankrupt and he returned to the UK in November 1996. Shortly after his return, in February 1997, Margaret died unexpectedly.

When Gardner returned to writing, his second book, &quot;Bottled Spider&quot;, introduced a new character, Detective Sergeant Suzie Mountford. Gardner took the surname from Patricia Mountford, an ex-girlfriend to whom he had been engaged in 1949. When she read the book Mountford contacted Gardner through his publishers, and the two were subsequently engaged.

Gardner died on Friday 3 August 2007 from suspected heart failure.

<text>The Onedin Line is a BBC television drama series that ran from 1971 to 1980. The series was created by Cyril Abraham.

The series is set in Liverpool from 1860 to 1886 and covers the rise of a fictional shipping company, the Onedin Line, named after its owner captain James Onedin. Around this, it depicts the lives of his family, most notably his brother and partner Robert, a ship chandler, and his sister Elizabeth, giving insight into the lifestyle and customs at the time, not only at sea, but also ashore (mostly lower- and upper-middle-class). The series also illustrates some of the changes in business and shipping, such as from wooden to steel ships and from sailing ships to steamships. It shows the role that ships played in such matters as international politics, uprisings and the slave trade.

== Overview ==

==Characters==

===Main===

James Onedin (Peter Gilmore), the younger son of Samuel Onedin, a miserly ship chandler, who left his shop and money to his elder son Robert, and a few words of advice to James. He was a 28 year old penniless sea captain with aspirations to greater things. To become a ship-owner, he marries Anne Webster, who is over 30, some years his senior. She is the spinster daughter of Captain Joshua Webster (James Hayter), owner of the topsail schooner &quot;Charlotte Rhodes&quot;. At first, it is purely a business transaction on Onedin&#x27;s part and a pragmatic solution to penniless spinsterhood on Anne&#x27;s part; but a warmer relationship gradually develops.

On Anne&#x27;s death in childbirth, 11+ years later (at the end of the second series), James has come to love her deeply. Her portrait continues to hang prominently in his home for many years.

Several years later, James considers two possible replacement wives: wealthy and emancipated widow Caroline Maudsley, and the young heiress Leonora Biddulph (Kate Nelligan), ultimately being rejected by both.

After a slow-burning courtship, he eventually marries his daughter&#x27;s governess, Letty Gaunt (Jill Gascoine). Tragedy strikes in the first year of the marriage when she, unfortunately in James&#x27;s view, becomes pregnant. The memories of Anne&#x27;s death have always remained in his thoughts. In due course, Letty also dies, of diphtheria.

By the final series, James is married to a third wife, the exotic Margarita Juarez, and is, by then, a grandfather. He is framed for theft and imprisoned. He is freed when Elizabeth, Baines, and Samuel discover evidence to clear his name. On his release, he takes to the sea again with Captain Baines, on business to South America, stabilising his life for the next 20 years, only to find Margarita as a stowaway. On the voyage home, she reveals that she is pregnant and unable, as was Baines as a cargo captain, to deliver the baby, so the cook is left to do the job. A baby son is delivered, with both mother and son well. James names the boy William, after Captain Baines. By the end of the series, James is in his mid-60s, or older.

James is a charismatic but morally flexible man, whose eye is always on how to make a profit from any given situation. He seems to consider himself amusing. His actions frequently lead to breaks with his nearest family and associates.

Anne Onedin (nee Webster) (Anne Stallybrass), is the spinster daughter of Captain Joshua Webster. In the mid-1850s (before the start of the series) she had been expecting to marry her sweetheart Michael Adams. However, he never returned from his first trip to sea on the &quot;Star of Morn&quot;. Anne is now in her early 30s and has nothing to look forward to after her father&#x27;s death than living on the charity of friends or the workhouse. Having rejected James&#x27;s offer to form a business partnership with her father, Captain Webster, she proposes and enters into marriage with James, in full recognition that it was a business transaction. She accompanies James to Portugal on his first trip in the &quot;Charlotte Rhodes&quot;, on their wedding day. She will subsequently travel with James on many of his trips, including to Australia, the Confederate States of America, East Africa and China.

James&#x27;s feelings of jealousy become piqued when he returns with his second ship, the clipper &quot;Pampero&quot;, to find that Anne&#x27;s former suitor, Michael Adams, has returned, having previously jumped ship after mistakenly believing he was being made the scapegoat for the murder of the mate of the &quot;Star of Morn&quot;. Adams signs on to the next voyage of the &quot;Pampero&quot; with James and Anne, where her conscience is affected when James covers up a death which occurred at the hands of Adams.

Anne is the conscience of James and, when she cannot take his ruthless business behaviour any longer, leaves him to live hand-to-mouth in the Liverpool slums, seriously affecting her health. They reunite after a yellow fever outbreak in Liverpool.

After James spends the money promised for their new house to buy another ship, the &quot;Maria da Gloria&quot;, Anne has a miscarriage, brought on by carrying coal from the cellar to her kitchen. This event leads him to sell some shares in the Onedin Line to Lord and Lady Lazenby to finance a fashionable new house for Anne. As Captain Webster opines, &quot;out of guilt&quot;.

On her reconciliation with James, she accompanies him to China in his bid to regain control of the Onedin Line. During the voyage she ignores the doctor&#x27;s warning not to get pregnant, knowing how much James wants a son and heir, and, after a difficult voyage back from China, she dies giving birth to a daughter, Charlotte, less than 12 months after her previous miscarriage.
William Baines (Howard Lang), first mate to James. Taught by Anne to read and write, he becomes a captain and serves on all of Onedin&#x27;s ships. Appalled at Onedin&#x27;s business dealings and treatment of ships&#x27; crews, even though he is fully prepared to use his own fists to maintain discipline, he leaves to work for a rival shipping line for a short time, but returns to Onedin.

Another falling-out leads Baines to buy his own ship, but a fire breaks out, destroying the ship and killing Tom, a boy he and James took on first as a cabin boy and then as an indentured lad. Blaming James, he leaves again, and is tricked into the plot to frame James for theft. He then helps to clear James&#x27; name. On their last voyage together, James&#x27; wife Margarita has a baby son, who is named in Baines&#x27;s honour.

Lady Fogarty, Elizabeth Fogarty (nee Onedin, formerly Frazer) (Jessica Benton), James&#x27;s volatile sister, works in their father&#x27;s shop. She is informally engaged to marry seafarer Daniel Fogarty (Michael Billington). However, she does not fancy being a sea captain&#x27;s wife, and wants better things. Her head is turned by the attentions of the wealthy Albert Frazer (Philip Bond), developer of steamship technology and heir to the Frazer shipyards, a connection James soon turns to his own advantage. After a heated moment of passion aboard the &quot;Charlotte Rhodes&quot; with Daniel Fogarty, she falls pregnant. Against the advice of her family, she elopes with Albert. Elizabeth gives birth to a son, William Frazer, who she initially tried to raise as Albert&#x27;s son. William&#x27;s true parentage is accidentally revealed by James&#x27;s brother, Robert, at a party for the child&#x27;s first birthday. Albert agrees to raise William as his own.

The marriage is unhappy. Albert takes up with a music hall singer, Carrie Harris. Shortly before the death of Anne, the Frazers start divorce proceedings, but later reconcile. Albert takes frequent trips away on business, finally settling in South America, where he dies several years later. Elizabeth returns to the now-married Captain Fogarty. By the end of Series 3, Elizabeth is intending to run off with him to Australia, until she is informed that their plans will be financed by money that is rightfully her husband&#x27;s. Having sold her house, she is left with no option but to move in with her father-in-law.

Albert&#x27;s father, Jack Frazer (John Phillips) dies, leaving his shipyards and shipping line to Elizabeth for William to inherit on coming of age, so the Frazer name will live on, having discovered that William is the son of Daniel Fogarty. Elizabeth is surprisingly effective at running both the Frazer Line and the Frazer shipbuilding yards. She subsequently has a relationship with her employee, Matt Harvey. 
16 years after he left, Daniel Fogarty returns from Australia, where he has amassed a fortune, and marries Elizabeth, whom he still loves, to help and advise his son, who retains the name Frazer.

Elizabeth and Daniel became estranged, as their business interests differ and he rises in political circles to become ambassador to Turkey. She refuses to go with him, and remains to run Frazer&#x27;s. As time goes by, a reconciliation between Elizabeth and Daniel is in the offing as they exchange letters and Daniel resigns as ambassador. On his return to Liverpool, his ship is in a collision and he is declared missing.

Robert Onedin (Brian Rawlinson/James Garbutt (one series)), James&#x27;s older brother, takes after their father and counts coppers in the family ship chandlery, though he later expands it into a profitable department store, after visiting the United States to see new methods of selling. He and his wife Sarah have one son, Samuel, who at first cares more for the sea and ships than for shopkeeping. Robert is elected as a member of Parliament; he and Sarah move to a smart new residence, but his life abruptly comes to an end when he chokes on a bone at a family dinner.

Sarah Onedin (Mary Webster), wife of Robert, is always looking to improve her station in life as her husband&#x27;s status rises. She is upset at how her husband&#x27;s brother, James, borrows money from him to further his own ambitions. When her husband dies, she and her son, Samuel, run the business. She is shocked when her son marries Charlotte after William gets her pregnant. Sarah makes attempts to contact Robert through a medium, despite her son Samuel&#x27;s objections. She almost marries the fortune-hunting Captain Dampier. She is last heard of as having undertaken a tour of the world.

Letty Onedin (nee Gaunt) (Jill Gascoine) is employed as governess to James&#x27;s daughter Charlotte. She reconciles the two and grows to love James, while his feelings are initially repressed by memories of his first wife, Anne. Letty starts her own business, employing, at a fair wage, women whose men are out of work. James, recognizing that she is a force in her own right, softens; remembering Anne&#x27;s death, they are married with his proviso that they have no children. Letty falls pregnant, which she hides from James, owing to his loss of Anne in childbirth, as did Charlotte by her cousin William, and James returns from a voyage to discover that, like Anne before, she is having a difficult childbirth. The baby, James&#x27;s male heir, dies. Charlotte had a baby boy, Robert. Letty throws herself into work and builds a house for foundlings of prostitutes and destitute women, to the disbelief of prominent townsfolk. After some time, diphtheria breaks out amongst the children at the home; Letty nurses the children and dies from the disease.

Margarita Onedin (nee Suarez) is the daughter of a South American politician who is killed in a revolution. James rescues her after her escape from the fighting, and quickly marries her. In the final episode of the series, during a voyage &quot;&#x27;round the Horn&quot;, she gives birth to James&#x27;s son, Will Onedin, named after Captain Baines.

===The Cousins===

When the series begins, Robert and Sarah&#x27;s son, Samuel, has already been born. Elizabeth and Daniel&#x27;s son, William, is conceived aboard the Charlotte Rhodes some months later, therefore at least a year younger than Samuel. James and Anne&#x27;s daughter, Charlotte, is born at the end of Series 2. Based on the travels (including voyages to Australia, around the Horn to the American West Coast, to The Confederate States of America, some time spent recouping James&#x27; fortune by trading around the world, including to East Africa and their final race back from China against Daniel Fogarty, with tea clipper fleet) and events (a miscarriage, some time spent living separately, the setting up of Onedin Warehouses, the acquiring and loss of the Pampero and 4 different houses) that happened during James and Anne&#x27;s marriage, she must be at least several years younger than Samuel and William. However, from somewhere during Series 4 and 5, the cousins have retroactively all born within months of each other and Charlotte as a young child moved between Elizabeth Fraser and Sarah Onedin&#x27; home, and her aunt Mary&#x27;s homes.

Charlotte Onedin (Laura Hartong), her mother Anne died when she was born and as a young child felt rejected by her father James as the cause of the death of her mother. Reconciled with her father by Letty her governess who married her father. She fell in love with her cousin William Frazer, but he abandoned her when she became pregnant by him. Instead, she married her other cousin, Samuel Onedin, who initially loved her. She had two children, Robert (by William) and Anne (by Samuel). Following William&#x27;s death, Charlotte and the now successful Samuel were increasingly unhappy and Charlotte ran off with Seth Burgess (Michael Walker), a sea captain who owed money and his ship to James. Her father pursued her and she realized that her sea captain had no feelings for her when Burgess traded the ship for her. She returned to England with her father suffering a serious head injury when hit by a falling block and tackle. Samuel divorced Charlotte, citing her infidelity with Seth Burgess and taking custody of Robert and Anne. Charlotte, after staying with her aunt, left to take up a career as an actress and music hall singer &quot;The Lancashire Nightingale&quot; much to the horror of her father; although alleviated by the money she was earning. When her father was in prison, she returned home to help run the business and had secret meetings with Samuel to discuss their children.

William Frazer (Marc Harrison), the result of a relationship between Elizabeth and Daniel Fogarty. Elizabeth married Albert Frazer before he was born and Albert brought him up as his own son. As a young man, he came under the influence of Josiah Beaumont (Warren Clarke), an ambitious banker. Daniel Fogarty returned to marry Elizabeth and together they thwarted the plans of Beaumont. Denied access to his son by a bitter Samuel and Charlotte. Shortly afterwards, William was killed by a runaway horse and wagon.

Samuel Onedin (Christopher Douglas), son of Robert and Sarah and heir to his father&#x27;s department store. As a youngster, he grew up with William and Charlotte and was more interested in the sea and ships. He became a stowaway on one of James&#x27;s ships. On his father&#x27;s death, he began to run the department store with his mother. Always fond of Charlotte, he married her when she became pregnant with William&#x27;s baby. Charlotte never reciprocated his feelings, leading to an acrimonious parting after she went off with a sea captain leaving her two children. After a trip to the United States, he returned with a new bride, Caroline. An heiress to a fortune, she immediately put Charlotte in her place by taking full control of the children&#x27;s upbringing. When Caroline&#x27;s ambitions for Samuel&#x27;s election as an MP in Daniel Fogarty&#x27;s seat failed, she grew colder. Samuel secretly saw Charlotte.

===Recurring===

Captain Joshua Webster (James Hayter), the father of Anne Onedin and the original owner of the &quot;Charlotte Rhodes&quot;. When the series begins he is a retired Royal Navy Captain on a small pension. He has been unable to maintain the &quot;Charlotte Rhodes&quot; in a seaworthy condition, and now spends most of his pension on rum.

Initially angry at Anne&#x27;s decision to marry James, but more so at the loss of his ship, he comes to accept the situation, though he is the first to point out James&#x27; flaws. After his daughter&#x27;s death he fell under the oversight of Robert and Sarah, much to their irritation. On several occasions James sent him off to conduct business, usually on ships captained by Captain Baines. The relationship between the two is usually one of comical frustration. Captain Webster is not heard of again after Series 3, so it is assumed that he died some time during the mid/late 1870s.
Thomas Callon (Edward Chapman), the owner of the Callon Line. When the series starts he was the employer of James. After James sets up the Onedin Line, in competition with the Callon Line, and subsequently takes one of Callon&#x27;s most profitable contracts (to carry Señor Braganza&#x27;s Portuguese wine), the two become implacable enemies. Throughout the first series Callon, aided by his son Edmund (James Warwick), attempted to ruin both James and Robert Onedin, he also promoted and relied on Daniel Fogarty. Callon finally became the majority shareholder and Chairman of the Onedin Steamship Line.

At the start of Series 2 both Callon and his son are killed in a fire at the Callon warehouse. A fire which nearly kills Albert Frazer.

Emma Callon (Jane Seymour) was the niece of Thomas Callon, and after his death she inherited the Callon Line. She has little interest in running the company herself, so she employs Daniel Fogarty as General Manager, and they become close. After he seduced her, they married, their honeymoon being a race against James to China and back to gain the controlling balance of Onedin Line shares.

Emma quickly grew to despise her husband and his mismanagement led her to transfer a 70% stake of the Callon Line to Jack Frazer to settle its debts and to guarantee her an income from her remaining 30% of the newly renamed Frazer Line. Daniel then decided to abandon her and run off with Elizabeth. When he returned from Australia, 16 years later, Emma was living in seclusion with consumption, dying shortly afterwards (in the early 1890s) and leaving her share of the Frazer Line to Daniel.

==The &quot;Charlotte Rhodes&quot;==

In the TV series James Onedin&#x27;s first ship, the &quot;Charlotte Rhodes&quot;, was portrayed by a schooner of the same name, built in 1904 in Fjellebroens Shipyard, Denmark, by F. Hoffman. She appeared in the series from 1971 until 1976. Later the ship became unseaworthy so she was dropped from the series. While some sources suggest she was replaced by another schooner called &quot;Kathleen and May&quot;, there is nothing in that ship&#x27;s history to support this. The original &quot;Charlotte Rhodes&quot; was a victim of arson in October 1979 in the Netherlands before the end of the series. The first link between the &quot;Kathleen &amp; May&quot; and the &quot;Charlotte Rhodes&quot; was not made until 2005.

The topsail schooner &quot;Charlotte Rhodes&quot; was originally owned by Captain Joshua Webster. His spinster daughter Anne was married by James Onedin, in order to become a ship-owner. A shrewd and often ruthless operator, James soon built up a fleet, assisted by the loyal Mr (later Captain) Baines (Howard Lang). His other sailing ships included the &quot;Pampero&quot;, the &quot;Medusa&quot;, the &quot;Søren Larsen&quot;, the ex-Portuguese slaver &quot;Maria di Gloria&quot;, the &quot;Neptune&quot;, the &quot;Falcon&quot;, the &quot;Trident&quot;, the &quot;Osprey&quot;, the &quot;Orphia&quot;, the &quot;Oberon&quot;, the &quot;Orpheus&quot;, the &quot;Esther Lohse&quot;, the &quot;Osiris&quot;, the steamship &quot;Shearwater&quot;, the &quot;Christian Radich&quot;, the &quot;Thorsoe&quot;, the steamer &quot;Black Pearl&quot;, the &quot;Jenny Peak&quot; renamed the &quot;Letty Gaunt&quot;, the &quot;Ondine&quot;, the &quot;Orlando&quot;, the &quot;Star of Bethlehem&quot;, the &quot;Teawynd&quot; and the &quot;Lady Lazenby&quot;. He also initiated the building of a steamship, the &quot;Anne Onedin&quot; (until the death of his wife, to be named the &quot;Golden Nugget&quot;, and briefly named the &quot;Scotch Lass&quot; after her dubious acquisition by Mr Frazer for the shell company, The Wirral Steam Navigation Company).

==Production==

===Conception===
Series creator Cyril Abraham had originally envisaged &quot;The Onedin Line&quot; as being about a modern shipping company with its boardroom battles and seagoing adventures, but then he discovered that almost all such companies were run by boards of anonymous executives. However, he noticed that most of these companies had their origins in the 19th century, mostly started by one shrewd and far-sighted individual who, through his own business acumen, built up a shipping line from nothing. Abraham stated that James Onedin was not based on one individual but was rather an amalgamation of several characters. Suggested real-life inspirations include Victorian era shipping line owner James Baines &amp; Co. of Liverpool (a leading character in the series was named &#x27;Captain Baines&#x27;), Sir Samuel Cunard and various members of the Allan Line family.

An article in &quot;Woman&quot; magazine published in July 1973 featured an interview with Cyril Abraham in which he recalled how he came up with the very unusual family name Onedin.

He wanted something unique. He had decided to call the leading male character James but still had not found a surname when the BBC agreed to film the story. Then some inspiration - he said:

The programme was recorded in Dartmouth, Devon, as well as certain scenes in Exeter, Falmouth and Gloucester (many of the dock scenes). The last series was filmed in Pembroke Dock, Wales, where the 18th-century naval dockyard and surrounding streets became Liverpool, and various coastal locations in the Pembrokeshire area substituted for Turkey and Portugal.

Due to its popularity in Sweden, the series inspired the name for a real-life shipping line in Stockholm, the Ånedin-Linjen, founded in 1973, which until recently operated cruises in the Baltic.

===Music===

The music behind the opening credits of the series is an excerpt from the Adagio of Spartacus and Phrygia from the ballet &quot;Spartacus&quot; by Aram Khachaturian. Other background music includes excerpts from Ralph Vaughan Williams&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 &#x27;London&#x27;, Symphony No. 5 and Fantasia on a Theme of Thomas Tallis, Manuel de Falla&#x27;s The Three-Cornered Hat, Gustav Holst&#x27;s Fugal Overture, Gustav Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 and Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 and Jean Sibelius&#x27;s Tapiola, symphonic poem for orchestra.

Traditional music, including folk songs and sea shanties in particular, are heard in abundance throughout the series, including such songs as &quot;The Maid of Amsterdam&quot;, &quot;Ruben Ranzo&quot;, &quot;South Australia&quot;, &quot;Maggie May&quot;, &quot;The Sailor&#x27;s Hornpipe&quot;, &quot;Botany Bay&quot;, &quot;Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes&quot;, &quot;A Hundred Years Ago&quot;, &quot;Blow the Man Down&quot;, and &quot;On Ilkla Moor Baht &#x27;at&quot;.

Victoria Thomas is a female child actress who played &quot;Charlotte Onedin&quot; in &quot;Month of the Albatross&quot;, &quot;A Clear Conscience&quot; and &quot;Undercurrent&quot;.

==Novels==
There are six novels based on the series.

The first five are all by the series creator, Cyril Abraham:

* &quot;The Shipmaster&quot; (1972) 
* &quot;The Iron Ships&quot; (1974) 
* &quot;The High Seas&quot; (1975) 
* &quot;The Trade Winds&quot; (1977) 
* &quot;The White Ships&quot; (1979) 

The books are not straightforward novelisations of the television episodes, since the author introduced additional material and also changed a number of details, though dialogue from the series that Abraham had penned himself is utilised. In print, Elizabeth&#x27;s child is conceived in a private room above a restaurant, not on the &quot;Charlotte Rhodes&quot;; George Callon lasted considerably longer and died in bed after suffering a stroke, not in a warehouse fire; Emma was Callon&#x27;s daughter, not his niece;

Captain Webster remarried, his new partner being the irrepressible old crone Widow Malloy, an entertaining character with a repertoire of coarse remarks; Albert did not abscond to Patagonia but died aboard ship following his involvement in retrieving a kidnapped Elizabeth from Daniel Fogarty; Caroline Maudslay and Matt Harvey were omitted altogether (though Matt did appear in two short stories - see below); Jack Frazer&#x27;s life was extended and he lived to see both Emma&#x27;s death and Daniel&#x27;s return from Australia, though his television discovery that William was not his grandson never took place.

The sixth novel, &quot;The Turning Tide&quot; (1980) , was written by Bruce Stewart. This deviated even more from the television series and probably from Cyril Abraham&#x27;s intentions as well. Letty was depicted as a jealous harpy aiming unpleasant remarks at Charlotte; Elizabeth and Daniel ended up emigrating to Australia permanently and James became the owner of the Frazer Line.

A series of Onedin short stories by Cyril Abraham, set between Series Two and Series Three, appeared in &quot;Woman&quot; magazine in 1973: &quot;For The Love Of A Lady&quot;; &quot;Amelia&quot;; &quot;The Woman from the Streets&quot;; &quot;The Mistress and the Wife&quot; and &quot;The Choice&quot;. The plots involved: two seamen who were rivals for the same woman; Robert&#x27;s encounter with the attractive Amelia; an appearance by Sarah&#x27;s destitute sister Constance; a social gathering that revolves around the naming of the first Onedin steamship; and the first appearance in James&#x27; life of Leonora Biddulph.

A later tale by Abraham, &quot;For Love of the Onedins&quot;, appeared in a short-lived magazine called &quot;tvlife&quot;. This story, covering Leonora&#x27;s wedding, occurs between Series Three and Series Four and features Matt Harvey, who was Elizabeth&#x27;s love interest during the fourth series. There is a slanging match between Elizabeth and Sarah, who each disparage the circumstances of the other&#x27;s wedding day until Leonora intervenes to restore peace.

A final story was published in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, entitled &quot;Cat and Mouse&quot;. It was set during Series Four and Matt Harvey made his second appearance in print.

Cyril Abraham had planned to write a whole series of novels about the Onedin Line, but he died in 1979 after completing the fifth novel, &quot;The White Ships&quot;. The story was eventually to have seen James and Elizabeth as two wizened old autocrats, both determined not to relinquish their hold on the shipping business. James would have died as a very old man, leaving the family divided over control of the company. Cyril Abraham had intended the Onedin saga to continue right up to the 1970s.

==Additional books==
In June 1977, &quot;The World of The Onedin Line&quot; by Alison McLeay was published. The hardback book () was a historical and factual look at the world and places in which &quot;The Onedin Line&quot; was set.

Peter Graham Scott&#x27;s autobiography &quot;British Television: An Insider&#x27;s Story&quot; (McFarland &amp; Company, 2000) includes a full (25-page) chapter on the setting-up of the series and his time as producer (and occasional director/writer) on the first 42 episodes, along with six behind-the-scenes black-and-white photos.

==Broadcasts==
The pilot was produced by Anthony Coburn and was broadcast as a one-off BBC Drama Playhouse production on 7 December 1970. It was announced in September 2010 that a copy of the pilot episode was discovered in the American Library of Congress, however this report turned out to be inaccurate and it remains lost. The story and the cast were basically the same as the resulting series with the exception of Sheila Allen playing Anne Webster/Onedin; Anne Stallybrass took over the part for the series. The series was originally aired in the United Kingdom by the BBC, from 15 October 1971 to 26 October 1980. In the Netherlands, broadcasts started in 1972.

In the mid 1980s, the BBC repeated the series in a daytime slot. From 1992 UK Gold repeated the series in full, ending repeats in 1998, before moving to sister channel UK Gold Classics in October 1998 when that channel was launched, although it was only available on Sky Digital on weekends between 6pm-2am and the showing only lasted around six months.

In 2000 it reappeared on UK Drama and has been repeated in full on that channel in more recent years. In 2007 MAX restarted a broadcast of the first series, with one episode every weekday (Monday through Friday), starting 10 July 2007. The UK digital channel Yesterday began running the whole series from 27 July 2010. As with many of the vintage series run by the channel, the episodes are slightly cut, from the c.50m length standard in the 1970s to the c.46m standard on Yesterday. As of 6 January 2018, the UKTV channel Drama began repeating the series from the first episode at the rate of four episodes a week. Talking Pictures TV started a weekly repeat on 4 September 2022.

==Popularity in communist Romania==

Among other TV shows from the West like &quot;Poldark&quot; and &quot;Dallas&quot;, &quot;The Onedin Line&quot; was a huge success in communist Romania in the late seventies and early eighties, when it was broadcast by Romanian TV. Eventually it was discontinued (together with other popular TV shows) in favour of the omnipresent state propaganda designed to show off the successes of dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu. Consequently, to flee this propaganda the population tuned into foreign stations (if possible) to continue watching their favourite tv shows but also to receive uncensored news about events like the fall of the Berlin Wall. This can be considered as a small contribution to the uprising which brought down the Ceaușescu regime.

==Home media==
Home video versions of the series have been made available in various versions over the years. For series one, edited versions were made available by BBC Video on VHS in the 1990s. These edited masters saw a re-release in the UK on DVD from Universal Playback in 2003. The Australian (from ABC) and Dutch (from Memphis Belle) DVD versions of series one also derive from these edited versions. In North America, Canadian company BFS Video released the first four episodes uncut on VHS in 2001, with these and the next four episodes arriving on DVD in two double-disc sets two years later.

It would not be until 2007 that all 15 episodes of the first series became available uncut on DVD, in the UK from 2 entertain in a four-disc set.

Series two follows a similar pattern, with edited versions arriving on VHS and DVD in the UK from the same companies listed above. The version from the Netherlands is sourced from the same masters. The Australian version, however, has all 14 episodes uncut on four discs, and was released in 2008.

Series three to eight are available on DVD from Memphis Belle in the Netherlands, and all are uncut. All series are also available in Germany.

Series three and four are available uncut in the UK and Australia.

All current DVD editions are uncut, apart from the Australian series one and the Dutch series one and two. The earlier edited UK versions of the first two series are still available from a number of sites.

<doc id="756099" wikidata="Q1386468" url="?curid=756099" title="Three Rivers District">
<text>Three Rivers is a local government district in south-west Hertfordshire, England. Its council is based in Rickmansworth. The district borders Hertsmere, Watford, St Albans, Dacorum, Buckinghamshire, and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Harrow.

==History==
Three Rivers District was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of two former districts and most of a third, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Chorleywood Urban District
*Rickmansworth Urban District
*Watford Rural District, except the parish of Aldenham, which went to Hertsmere, and the part within the designated area of Hemel Hempstead New Town, which went to Dacorum.

The new district was named &quot;Three Rivers&quot;, referencing the rivers Chess, Colne, and Gade which flow through the district and have their confluence in Rickmansworth, the largest town in the district.

==Governance==

Hertfordshire has a two-tier structure of local government, with the ten district councils (including Three Rivers District Council) providing district-level services, and Hertfordshire County Council providing county-level services. In some areas there is an additional third tier of civil parishes.

===Responsibilities===
Three Rivers District Council carries out a variety of district council functions including:
*Benefits - Housing and Council Tax
*Car Parking
*Concessionary Travel
*Council Tax - Administration and Collection
*Elections and Electoral Registration
*Environmental Health
*Food Safety and Hygiene Complaints
*Noise Pollution and Pest Control
*Housing Administration
*Licensing
*Caravan Sites
*Town Planning
*Public Conveniences
*Health and Leisure Centres
*Refuse Collection
*Recycling
*Tourism and Visitor Information

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since a by-election in August 2024, having previously been under Liberal Democrat majority control since 2018. The leaders of the council have been Liberal Democrats (or their predecessors, the SDP–Liberal Alliance) since 1986, including through some periods of minority administrations.

The first election to Three Rivers District Council was held in 1973, initially acting as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 1986 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election and a change of allegiance in May 2024 and by-election in August 2024, the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in May 2026.

===Premises===
The council&#x27;s main offices are at Three Rivers House on Northway in the centre of Rickmansworth, which was purpose-built for the council in 1991. The site had been part of the grounds of Basing House, which had bought by the old Rickmansworth Urban District Council in 1930 to serve as its headquarters.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2014 the council has comprised 39 councillors representing 13 wards, each of which elects three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, electing one councillor from each ward each time. Elections to Hertfordshire County Council are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no district council elections.

===Wards===
The wards of the district are:

* Abbots Langley and Bedmond
* Carpenders Park
* Chorleywood North and Sarratt
* Chorleywood South and Maple Cross
* Dickinsons
* Durrants
* Gade Valley
* Leavesden
* Moor Park and Eastbury
* Oxhey Hall and Hayling
* Penn and Mill End
* Rickmansworth Town
* South Oxhey
===Wider politics===
====County council====
For elections to Hertfordshire County Council, the district is divided into six divisions, three of which are held by the Conservatives, and three by the Liberal Democrats:

====Parliament====
For parliamentary elections, the entire district is has been part of the South West Hertfordshire constituency since the 2024 general election. The constituency is not quite coterminous with the district, however, as it also contains the ward of Kings Langley from the Dacorum district. The current MP is Gagan Mohindra of the Conservative Party.

==Rail==
Train services are provided by Chiltern Railways and the Metropolitan line of the London Underground.

London Underground stations:
*Chorleywood
*Croxley
*Rickmansworth
*Moor Park

Chiltern Railways stations:
*Chorleywood
*Rickmansworth

A special fare structure exists as the stations are outside the Greater London boundary.

==Settlements==
*Abbots Langley
*Chorleywood
*Croxley Green
*Loudwater

==Civil parishes==
Three Rivers is partially parished. There are six civil parishes in the district:
*Abbots Langley
*Batchworth
*Chorleywood
*Croxley Green
*Sarratt
*Watford Rural

There are also two unparished areas in the district, both comprising parts of the former Rickmansworth Urban District which have not subsequently been added to a parish: one larger area including Maple Cross and Mill End, Rickmansworth; and a smaller area including part of Loudwater.

<text>Ras Al Khaimah International Airport () is an international airport located in Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates. The airport has two passenger terminal buildings as well as cargo, aircraft maintenance, and aviation training facilities.

==History==

In 1976, the airport was inaugurated by RAK ruler, Sheikh Saqr bin Mohammad Al Qasimi. In 2007, RAK Airways started operating as the national airline with a hub at the airport. It suspended regular operations in 2008 due to the global economic crisis. It relaunched in 2010 with new branding and management, but suspended operations permanently in 2013.

In 2014, Air Arabia started its commercial flights to different destinations including Pakistan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh following the suspension of RAK Airways. Ras Al Khaimah was designated as a hub for Air Arabia for a period of ten years, extendable thereafter.

Growing at 25% year-on-year in 2013 (albeit from a low base), the airport was refocused with efforts to attract cargo business, in particular from establishments under the Ras Al Khaimah Free Trade Zone.

==Airlines and destinations==
The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at Ras Al Khaimah Airport:

==Accidents and incidents==
* In July 1998, a Ukrainian Ilyushin Il-76 cargo plane (registration UR-76424) took off whilst heavily overloaded. After slowly climbing to the pilot received a GPWS warning, but then responded by descending the aircraft into the sea (CFIT), four minutes after take-off, and approximately offshore. All 8 crew members on board died.

==In popular culture==

<doc id="756107" wikidata="Q373491" url="?curid=756107" title="Geno Auriemma">
<text>Luigi &quot;Geno&quot; Auriemma (born March 23, 1954) is an American basketball coach who is the head coach of the UConn Huskies women&#x27;s basketball team. He holds the record for most wins (1,239) and highest winning percentage () among college coaches with a minimum of 10 seasons, any level, men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s. Since becoming head coach in 1985, he has led UConn to 17 undefeated conference seasons (including eight consecutive), of which six were undefeated overall seasons, with 11 NCAA Division I national championships, the most in women&#x27;s college basketball history, and has won eight national Naismith College Coach of the Year awards. Auriemma was the head coach of the United States women&#x27;s national basketball team from 2009 through 2016, during which time his teams won the 2010 and 2014 World Championships, and gold medals at the 2012 and 2016 Summer Olympics, going undefeated in all four tournaments. Auriemma was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006.

==Early life==
Auriemma emigrated with his family from Montella in Southern Italy to Norristown, Pennsylvania when he was seven years old, and he spent the rest of his childhood there. Auriemma grew up poor, with his parents working low wage factory jobs. Auriemma had to teach himself English after coming to the United States. After graduating from West Chester University in 1977, Auriemma was hired as an assistant coach at Saint Joseph&#x27;s University, where he worked in 1978 and 1979. Prior to coaching at Saint Joseph&#x27;s University he began his career coaching women&#x27;s basketball at Bishop McDevitt HS in Wyncote, Pennsylvania. He then took a two-year absence from college basketball, serving as an assistant coach at his former high school, Bishop Kenrick, before assuming an assistant coaching position with the University of Virginia Cavaliers women&#x27;s team in 1981. Auriemma became a naturalized United States citizen in 1994 at the age of 40, noting in his autobiography that he finally decided to naturalize when his University of Connecticut team was slated to tour Italy that summer and he was concerned about potential problems, as he had never done any required national service in his birth country.

When he was growing up, his favorite team was the 1970s New York Knicks coached by Red Holzman.

For many years, Auriemma and his wife, Kathy, maintained a home in Avalon, New Jersey, to be near their respective parents in the Philadelphia area.

==University of Connecticut career==
Prior to Auriemma&#x27;s arrival in 1985, the Huskies women&#x27;s basketball team had posted only one winning season in its history. The decision to hire Auriemma was part of the university&#x27;s commitment to better fund women&#x27;s sports. Auriemma&#x27;s was the final interview scheduled by the search staff. Most of the other candidates were highly qualified, and most were female. One of those included in the interview process was Chris Dailey, who would become Auriemma&#x27;s assistant and is currently the associate head coach. Dailey was identified as the candidate most likely to receive an offer if Auriemma turned down the position.

Connecticut quickly rose to prominence after Auriemma was hired in August 1985. After finishing 12–15 in Auriemma&#x27;s first season (his only losing season), the Huskies notched their first-ever 20-win season, first conference title and first NCAA Tournament appearance. Connecticut has finished above .500 for 33 consecutive seasons, including six undefeated seasons (1994–95, 2001–02, 2008–09, 2009–10, 2013–14, and 2015–16) and three NCAA record streaks of 111, 90 and 70 consecutive wins. On December 21, 2010, Auriemma led UConn to its 89th consecutive victory, one more than the all-time NCAA men&#x27;s wins record of 88 held by UCLA; the streak ended at 90 wins. The Huskies subsequently broke their own record with an 111-game winning streak that began in 2014 and ended in 2017. They have also appeared in every NCAA Tournament since 1989–as of the end of the 2023–24 season, the third-longest active consecutive appearances streak in Division I.

At the end of the 2023–24 season, Auriemma&#x27;s record as a head coach was 1217-162, for an 88.2 winning percentage. That winning percentage is the highest among Division I active coaches. His career at UConn also includes 27 seasons with 30 or more wins. UConn has won eleven national championships under Auriemma (1995, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016) and made the Final Four 23 times (1991, 1995, 1996, 2000–2004, 2008–2019, 2021, 2022, 2024). Auriemma has also guided UConn to 21 conference regular season titles and 20 conference tournament titles. They lost 17 conference games in the last two decades of play in the Big East Conference, and have never lost a conference game since the old Big East reorganized as the American Athletic Conference in 2013.

With the win in 2016, Auriemma passed UCLA men&#x27;s coach John Wooden for most college basketball championships, and the Huskies became the first Division I women&#x27;s basketball team to win four straight national championships.

The team has been especially successful on its home court in the Harry A. Gampel Pavilion on the UConn campus in Storrs, Connecticut, and in the larger XL Center in Hartford; they tied an NCAA women&#x27;s basketball record with 69 consecutive home wins between 2000 and 2003. That record was broken in 2011. The last home loss was to Villanova in the game that ended their 70-game winning streak. Moreover, between Auriemma&#x27;s arrival and the close of the 2005 season, UConn won 295 games versus just 31 losses. The team set Big East Conference records for both single-game and season-long attendance.

Auriemma is also known for cultivating individual players, and the 13 multiple-All-America players whom Auriemma has coached —Rebecca Lobo, Jennifer Rizzotti, Kara Wolters, Nykesha Sales, Svetlana Abrosimova, Sue Bird, Swin Cash, Diana Taurasi, Tina Charles, Maya Moore, Stefanie Dolson, Bria Hartley and Breanna Stewart— have combined to win eight Naismith College Player of the Year awards, seven Wade Trophies, and nine NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player awards. The UConn athletics website also notes that, through 2006–07, every recruited freshman who has finished her eligibility at UConn has graduated with a degree.

Since achieving its first #1 ranking in the 1994–95 season, UConn under Auriemma is 186–10 when playing as the nation&#x27;s #1 team. At the end of the 2009–10 season, he had a record of 127–52 against top 25 opponents and a 57–35 record against top 10 opponents. He won his 600th game on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2006, accomplishing the feat in 716 games, tying him with Phillip Kahler for the fastest women&#x27;s basketball coach to reach that milestone. Auriemma won his 700th game on November 27, 2009, in 822 total games, becoming the fastest head coach to that milestone in the history of college basketball at any level, men or women. He is now one of eight active women&#x27;s college basketball coaches to have 700 or more wins. Auriemma became the sixth coach in women&#x27;s basketball history to reach 800 career victories on March 6, 2012, also reaching 800 career wins faster than any coach in the history of college basketball men or women at any division level in just 928 career games. On February 3, 2015, Auriemma notched his 900th victory in only 1,034 games, reaching this milestone also faster than any college coach in history. Auriemma was a member of the inaugural class (2006) of inductees to the University of Connecticut women&#x27;s basketball Huskies of Honor recognition program.
Auriemma&#x27;s 2013–2018 salary is $10.9 million. Auriemma reached his 1,200th career win against Seton Hill on February 7, 2024.

===Staged shot incident===
Auriemma created controversy in 1998 when he arranged with Villanova coach Harry Perretta to orchestrate a shot at the beginning of their scheduled game. University of Connecticut&#x27;s top player, Nykesha Sales, was two points short of breaking the team record for most points in a career when she ruptured her right Achilles tendon in the second to last game of the season against Notre Dame. When the following game, against Villanova, began, Villanova players allowed Connecticut to win the tip off and then pass the ball down to Sales who was standing underneath the basket. She laid the ball in to break the record. Connecticut players then stood back and allowed Villanova an uncontested layup of their own before beginning regular play.

===Rivalries===
The rivalry between the Huskies and the University of Tennessee Lady Vols extended to Auriemma&#x27;s relationship with Volunteers counterpart Pat Summitt. The two, through print and broadcast media, were often at odds. At the end of the 2009–10 season, Auriemma had slightly surpassed Summitt among active Division I coaches for career winning percentage, with Auriemma at 85.8 and Summitt at 84.1. In 2007, Summitt, who believed Auriemma had used less-than-honorable tactics in his successful recruitment of Maya Moore, canceled the yearly game between the two programs. After Summitt announced her diagnosis of early onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2011, the two mended their relationship, with Auriemma donating ten thousand dollars to Summitt&#x27;s Alzheimer&#x27;s foundation. Summitt retired in 2012 and died in 2016.

Former UConn men&#x27;s basketball coach Jim Calhoun has been called Auriemma&#x27;s &quot;unfriendly rival&quot;, and he once mocked the women&#x27;s team&#x27;s fan base as the &quot;world&#x27;s largest nursing home.&quot; When asked about their relationship in 2001, Auriemma said, &quot;Jim has a problem with anyone else&#x27;s success, not just ours. Do we get along? No, but we don&#x27;t have to.&quot;

==United States women&#x27;s national basketball team==

Auriemma was named head coach of the US women&#x27;s team that competed in the Junior World Championship in Brno, Czech Republic in July 2001. The team won its first five games, including a record-setting win against Mali. The 97–27 final score represented the largest margin of victory by a USA team in Junior World Championship history. The preliminary round results qualified the team for the medal rounds, where they faced the host team, the Czech Republic. With a home crowd cheering them on, the Czech team won 92–88 and went on to beat Russia 82–80 to win the gold medal. The US team beat Australia 77–72 to win the bronze medal. Diana Taurasi was the leading scorer for the US with 19.3 points per game, while Alana Beard was close behind with 18.0 points per game. Nicole Powell was the leading rebounder for the US, with seven rebounds per game.

Auriemma was named head coach of the US women&#x27;s national team in preparation for competition in the 2010 World Championships and 2012 Olympics. Because many team members were still playing in the WNBA until just prior to the World Championship, the team had only one day of practice with the entire team before leaving for Ostrava and Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic. Despite this, the team won its first game against Greece by 26 points. The team continued to dominate with victory margins exceeding 20 points in the first five games. Several players shared scoring honors, with Swin Cash, Angel McCoughtry, Maya Moore, Diana Taurasi, Lindsay Whalen, and Sylvia Fowles all ending as high scorer in the first few games. The sixth game was against undefeated Australia — the USA jumped out to a 24-point lead and won 83–75. Team USA won its next two games by over 30 points, then faced the host team, the Czech Republic, in the championship game. They had a five-point lead at halftime, which was cut to three points, but the Czechs never got closer. Team USA won the championship and gold medal. At the 2012 Olympics, Auriemma&#x27;s team went 8–0 and won the gold medal game over France 86–50. Their closest match of the Olympics – and the only game in which their margin of victory was less than 25 points – was an 86–73 win in the semi-finals over eventual Bronze Medal winner Australia.

Auriemma was again named head coach of the US women&#x27;s basketball team for the 2014 FIBA World Championship for Women and the 2016 Summer Olympics. In the 2014 World Championship, his team went 6–0 and won the gold medal, outscoring their opponents 553–380 over the six games – an average margin of victory of almost 30 points per game.

Auriemma served as an assistant coach to the gold medalist 2000 U.S. Olympic Team. On April 15, 2009, he was selected to lead USA Basketball Women&#x27;s National Team in the 2010 FIBA World Championship in the Czech Republic and the London 2012 Summer Olympics.

Auriemma is a member of the Board of Directors of the Kay Yow/WBCA Cancer Fund.

Auriemma is a member of the board of directors at Connecticut Children&#x27;s Foundation, Inc. and hosts a charity series of events, Geno for the Kids, every year benefiting Connecticut Children&#x27;s Medical Center.

<text>Jack Hargreaves OBE (31 December 1911 – 15 March 1994), full name John Herbert Hargreaves, was an English television presenter and writer whose enduring interest was to comment without nostalgia or sentimentality on accelerating distortions in relations between the city and the countryside, seeking – in entertaining ways – to question and rebut metropolitan assumptions about its character and function. Hargreaves is remembered for appearing on &quot;How&quot;, a children&#x27;s programme which he also conceived, about how things worked or ought to work. It ran from 1966 on Southern Television (of which Hargreaves was a director) and networked on ITV until the demise of Southern in 1981.

Hargreaves was the presenter of the weekly magazine programme &quot;Out of Town&quot;, first broadcast in 1960 following the success of his series &quot;Gone Fishing&quot; the previous year. Broadcast on Friday evenings on Southern Television the programme was also taken up by many of the other ITV regions, usually in a Sunday afternoon slot. In each episode Hargreaves appeared in short 16mm film reports on some aspect of rural life, usually one in each half of the episode. The films were introduced and narrated by him from a studio set based on the interior of a garden shed.

In 1967, with Ollie Kite he presented &quot;Country Boy&quot;, a networked children&#x27;s programme of 20 episodes in which a boy from the city was introduced to the ways of country. Two further series followed in 1969 and 1970. Other programmes he created for local viewers were &quot;Farm Progress&quot; and a live afternoon series &quot;Houseparty&quot;. His country programmes continued after the demise of Southern Television with &quot;Old Country&quot; for Channel 4 – effectively a retitled &quot;Out of Town&quot;.

Hargreaves was involved in the setting up of ITV, and a member of Southern&#x27;s board of directors, and was employed by the National Farmers&#x27; Union, serving on the Nugent Committee (the Defence Lands Committee that investigated which parts of the Ministry of Defence holdings could be returned to private ownership). Hargreaves was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1972 New Year Honours. A biography of Hargreaves by Paul Peacock was published in July 2006.

==Early life==
Born in Edmonton, 
Middlesex, on 31 December 1911, the son of James Arthur and Ada Hargreaves (née Jubb), Jack was christened John Herbert and was one of three brothers. The family was rooted in Armitage Bridge near Huddersfield in the West Riding of Yorkshire, where at the time of his marriage in 1907 James Hargreaves was a commercial traveller. He based himself partly in London in connection with his work and also to allow his wife the benefits of the capital&#x27;s midwifery. The brothers attended Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, then at the London Charterhouse, in Farringdon, after which Edward and Ronald Hargreaves pursued successful careers in medicine (Ronald became a noted psychiatrist), while in 1928 Jack went to study at the Royal Veterinary College of London University.

==Early career==

On leaving the college, Hargreaves worked as a vet&#x27;s assistant, but he was soon earning a living as a journalist. He also became a copywriter, and script writer for radio and films, and by the late 1930s he had established a reputation for his pioneering approaches to radio broadcasting.

At the outset of the Second World War, broadcasting was recognised as part of the war effort. Hargreaves&#x27; talents in this field meant that he faced being recruited to a restricted post in radio, a reserved occupation. Instead, he joined the Royal Artillery as a gunner, quickly became an NCO, entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and was commissioned in October 1942 into the Royal Tank Regiment. His reputation as a communicator went ahead of him and he was recruited to the staff of General Montgomery to play a role setting up broadcasting services to Allied forces before and after D-Day. He left the army in 1945 with the substantive rank of major, having briefly held the acting rank of lieutenant-colonel.

After the war, Hargreaves continued his media career and during the 1950s was editor of &quot;Lilliput&quot; magazine and &quot;Picture Post&quot; where he commissioned work from Bert Hardy. His brilliance as a communications manager led to his being recruited to the National Farmers Union by Jim Turner, later Lord Netherthorpe, who was celebrated for his success as a lobbyist for farmers. Working closely with Turner, Hargreaves organised and developed the NFU&#x27;s Information Department, founding the &quot;British Farmer&quot; magazine during an almost intractable crisis of trust between NFU HQ and the members of the largest union in the country, many of whom were experiencing seismic change in the agricultural economy. Hargreaves was deputy programme controller of Southern Television from 1964 to 1976, in which role he devised new programmes.

A lover of angling, Hargreaves was bemused at the way it had become tribalised by class and species, which he blamed on &quot;sociological, technical, financial and Malthusian&quot; causes. He wrote &quot;Fishing for a Year&quot; (1951), in which he argued for &quot;regression&quot; – the pursuit of different fish, in separate places and by varied methods, throughout the seasons. &quot;What do they know of fishing&quot; he wrote &quot;who know only one fish and one way to fish for him?&quot; Yet his language was seldom so polemic and never adversarial. Hargreaves&#x27; style was complemented in this first book by the drawings of his friend Bernard Venables:

&quot;It is one of the most excellent provisions of Nature&quot; he wrote in a chapter for the warmest time of the year &quot;that chub are to be angled for on hot summer afternoons ... When the grass is high and full of hum and rustle, when the comfrey blooms along the edge of the water and the air shivers in the heat, the chub lie just under the surface in slacks and corners and eddies all along the bank. You will see them and you will think they have not seen you&quot;. His writing and contacts among anglers saw the president of the Piscatorial Society, Sir Robert Saundby, asking Hargreaves to organise the Society&#x27;s library. With typical thoroughness the collection was removed to Jack&#x27;s home, leaving it fully catalogued with not a volume unread. This was when he became sceptical about the opinion of the 17th-century author of &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot;, Izaak Walton, as to the culinary qualities of the chub – a dish Hargreaves described as &quot;eating cotton wool full of pins and needles&quot;.

==The Nugent Report==
As an independent member of the Defence Lands Committee 1971–73, Hargreaves made key contributions to the Nugent Report, 1973, reviewing the use of land held by the country&#x27;s armed forces for defence purposes. He became of the opinion that one of the best ways to reserve the countryside for its proper purpose was to keep most people out of it. He believed that although agriculture would be preferable, military exercises seemed less harmful in their impact on the environment than its use for the recreational choices of a predominantly urban population. This was a conundrum he shared wryly with his audience, gently repeating the point, that the countryside, insofar as it had a purpose for humans, was to grow their food in sustainable ways.

==Family==

Jack Hargreaves was married, in 1932, to Jeanette Haighler. They had two sons, Mark and Victor; then, after divorce, he married Elisabeth Van de Putte in 1944. Two more sons were born – James Stephen in 1946 and Edward John in 1947. That marriage ended in 1948 when he began a relationship with a journalist from &quot;Vogue&quot;, Barbara Baddeley.

Living with her until 1963, Hargreaves became a stepfather to Bay and her brother Simon, Barbara&#x27;s children by the diplomat John Baddeley. He also had a daughter Polly, born in 1957 as a result of a six-year relationship with his secretary Judy Hogg.

In 1965, Hargreaves married Isobel Hatfield (born 12 April 1919). Isobel died four years after her husband on 5 February 1998 and her ashes were scattered with his on Bulbarrow Hill in Dorset, near their home.

==Published film, tapes and DVDs==
Hargreaves had worked with Steve Wade on &quot;How&quot; before Southern Television lost its franchise. In 1985 Hargreaves worked with Wade to make 28 new &quot;Out of Town&quot; episodes for video release. Instead of the studio &#x27;shed&#x27; that had been a mainstay of the earlier series, these episodes were made in Hargreaves&#x27;s real shed at his last home – Raven Cottage, Belchalwell, Dorset.

Using original cut film inserts he had bought from Southern, Hargreaves acquired a Steenbeck editing machine and, with Wade, selected films to be inserted into the new series with new links shot in the shed. They were distributed by Primetime, later Endemol, as VHS tapes and later DVDs.

Hargreaves also authored a number of audio-tapes and long play records on his favourite subjects.

In 2004, a full-length edition of &quot;Out of Town&quot;, first broadcast on 23 May 1980, was included on a DVD released by ITV Meridian to mark the closing of Southern Television&#x27;s Southampton studios. Until 2012 this remained the only one of Hargreaves&#x27; original broadcast programmes to have been published in any format. The whereabouts of the remaining master tapes was unknown for many years but 34 complete original episodes of &quot;Out of Town&quot; – broadcast in 1980 and 1981 – eventually came to light, and were made available on DVD.

Hargreaves&#x27; stepson, Simon Baddeley, who had been bequeathed rights in his stepfather&#x27;s books, film and sound footage, purchased &quot;Out of Town&quot; DVD rights from Endemol, restoring and re-releasing many more broadcasts via his licensee, &quot;Network on Air&quot; (now defunct). The CEO of &quot;Network&quot;, Tim Beddows, died in November 2022. Baddeley&#x27;s contract with &quot;Network&quot; ended when the company ceased trading in May 2023.

On 28 July 2010, comedians Robert Popper and Peter Serafinowicz added a new narration track to an episode of &quot;Out Of Town&quot; to create the spoof film &quot;Markets of Britain, a short film by Lee Titt&quot;.

Talking Pictures TV began broadcasting &quot;Out of Town&quot; on 5 February 2024.

<doc id="756171" wikidata="Q7756044" url="?curid=756171" title="The Parachute Club">
<text>The Parachute Club was a Canadian band formed in Toronto in 1982. They released three top 40 hits in Canada between 1983 and 1987, including &quot;Rise Up&quot;, &quot;At the Feet of the Moon&quot; and &quot;Love Is Fire&quot; (which featured guest duet vocals from John Oates). The band was well known for being one of the first mainstream pop acts in Canada to integrate world music influences, particularly Caribbean styles such as reggae and soca, into their sound.

&quot;The Chutes&quot;, as they were known, broke up after touring to promote their third and final album, and played their final gig in the summer of 1988. A reconstituted version of the Parachute Club (including four of the earlier band members) played a number of live shows between 2005 and 2008. The band reunited again in 2011 and remained intermittently active through 2014.

== History ==

=== Formation and early years (1982–1983) ===
The original Parachute Club band consisted of Lorraine Segato on vocals and guitar, Lauri Conger on keyboards and vocals, Billy Bryans on drums, Margo Davidson on saxophone and vocals, Julie Masi on percussion and vocals, Steve Webster on bass and Dave Gray on guitar. Davidson at the time was one of very few female saxophonists playing professionally; Segato, Conger and Bryans had previously been associated for several years as the nucleus of Mama Quilla II, a band that gained respect in Toronto in the late 1970s and early 1980s for their integrated musical and sexual politics—elements that would continue with The Parachute Club. Billy Bryans had also been a well-known percussionist and producer in Toronto since the early 1970s, primarily associated with the Downchild Blues Band during this period.

Segato and Bryans first met in 1979, and started to collaborate musically. By 1982, they were both members of the Toronto band V, which was formed while Mama Quilla II was then on hiatus. In the late summer of 1982, Bryans was offered a chance to play at Toronto&#x27;s inaugural Festival of Festivals, which later evolved into the Toronto International Film Festival. With other members of V unavailable, Bryans approached Segato to form a new one-off band to play at the festival. They added Lauri Conger from Mama Quilla II, as well as local musicians Margo Davidson, Dave Gray and Steve Webster. The band was well received at the festival, and shortly thereafter received and accepted an offer for both a management and recording contract with Current Records. Adding Jule Masi to the ranks, The Parachute Club was thereby formed, while Mama Quilla II made their &#x27;hiatus&#x27; permanent and disbanded.

=== Early success (1983–1984) ===
The Parachute Club&#x27;s eponymous first album, released in 1983, was produced by Daniel Lanois, who had previously been the recording engineer of Mama Quilla II&#x27;s sole release, an EP released in 1982. The group had to write material for the album rather quickly, and consequently recruited poet/artist Lynne Fernie to assist with some of the lyrics. Though Fernie would never be an official member of The Parachute Club, she would contribute lyrics to all their albums, and function as an unofficial honorary member of the group.

The song &quot;Rise Up&quot;, from Parachute Club&#x27;s first album, won a Canadian Juno Award in 1984 for Single of the Year, while the group won a Juno award for Most Promising Group of The Year.

During 1983, Steve Webster, a co-writer of Parachute Club&#x27;s best known song, &quot;Rise Up&quot; left the band, to perform with Billy Idol. On their 1983/84 touring dates, bassist Russ Boswell stepped in for Webster; he would then leave the band to join Corey Hart&#x27;s backing band. Keir Brownstone, formerly with Bob Segarini, became the band&#x27;s new permanent bassist in mid-1984.

The band&#x27;s second album &quot;At the Feet of the Moon&quot; was released in October 1984, and the title track became the group&#x27;s second Canadian Top 40 hit. This album (and single) was produced by Michael Beinhorn.

=== Later success (1985–1987) ===
In 1985, the group received the Juno Award for Group of the Year, as well as the equivalent CASBY award. An album of remixed tracks, &quot;Moving Thru The Moonlight&quot;, was also issued in late 1985.

In 1986, The Parachute Club released their third album, &quot;Small Victories&quot;. The album included the group&#x27;s third and final top 40 hit, &quot;Love is Fire&quot;, featuring Segato singing a duet with John Oates of Hall &amp; Oates. Oates produced the single, as well as several other &quot;Small Victories&quot; tracks; The Parachute Club and Mike Jones were credited as producers on the remainder of the album. In 1987, the group&#x27;s video of their single, &quot;Love Is Fire&quot; received the Juno Award for Video of the Year. Julie Masi left the band after their Canadian tour in support of the album, and was replaced on a session basis for live dates by singer Rebecca Jenkins.

In 1987, the group composed and performed four songs for the Canadian and U.S. versions of the anime series &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. During 1987, Lauri Conger also left the band, and Aaron Davis of Canadian jazz-fusion band Manteca was brought in as the group&#x27;s new session keyboard player.

=== Winding down (1988–1989) ===
The band (now officially a quintet of Segato, Bryans, Gray, Davidson, and Brownstone) recorded a final non-album single in 1988 (&quot;Big Big World&quot;). Bryans produced; guests included Aaron Davis (keyboards), and vocalists Rebecca Jenkins, Holly Cole and Micah Davis. The band&#x27;s final performances were in July 1988 at the Ontario Place Forum in Toronto, where the remaining band members were rejoined by Lauri Conger, filling in for an ill Davis.

In early 1989, the original Parachute Club formally disbanded, with band members going their separate ways. Some members, such as Lorraine Segato and Billy Bryans, continued as professional musicians, while other members, such as Margo Davidson and Lauri Conger, substantially left the music business. Davidson, who died in 2008 at the age of 50, became a creative writer and community activist for the homeless, serving as a director of St. Clare&#x27;s Multifaith Housing Society and as an outreach worker at Eva&#x27;s Phoenix.

In 2005, critic Greg Quill wrote in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; that &quot;No musical collective bespoke this city during a specific period as powerfully as Parachute Club did in the 1980s. Their infectious, inclusive, soca-soaked dance music carried important messages about the social changes Toronto was experiencing at the time, about sexual and personal politics, about the need for hope and courage in an age of confusing, impersonal rhetoric from local policymakers and world leaders.&quot;

=== Advertising controversy (1998) ===
In 1998, the Parachute Club song &quot;Rise Up&quot; was licensed by EMI Music Canada to McCain Foods Limited for a television commercial for self-rising pizza dough. Members of Parachute Club publicly opposed this commercial use of the song. In a news release issued at the commencement of litigation, band members stated that &quot;(a)s a result of its use on the ad...the song, the people who believe in it and the reputation of its creators have suffered damage within the sphere of public credibility and our personal reputations.&quot; A settlement resulted in the band members recovering their music rights from EMI.

=== Reunion and band revival (2005–2008, 2011–2014) ===
In 2005, a reconstituted Parachute Club commenced performing, co-headlining a reunion show with Martha and the Muffins and headlining at Toronto&#x27;s City Roots Festival. The reconstituted band included original members Segato, Bryans, and Gray, as well as Brownstone (who was a member of the band for their second and third albums). Masi, Conger, Steve Webster and Davidson were not part of this revived line-up. New members of the revived line-up were Mystic Walsh and Miranda Walsh (daughters of Eric Walsh, lead singer of Toronto reggae band Messenjah) on vocals, and Ashley Wey on keyboards. By 2008, these new members had been replaced by Chendy Leon Jr, Glenda del Monte and Rebecca Campbell (although Miranda Walsh subbed for an absent Campbell at one 2008 show).

In 2006, The Parachute Club was inducted into the Canadian Indies Hall of Fame. Founding member Margo Davidson died May 17, 2008, aged 50.

Through 2008, the reconstituted band performed on a regular basis, although they did not release any new material. The Parachute Club did not play any dates after August 2008, and the band&#x27;s website was not updated after this time. &quot;Rise Up&quot; was given the SOCAN Classic Award in 2000.

Segato performed &quot;Rise Up&quot; at the state funeral of Jack Layton on August 27, 2011, with the choir of the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto. The Parachute Club reunited again on September 30, 2011, for a free show in Toronto&#x27;s David Pecaut Square to celebrate their induction to Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame. The band line-up for the reunion consisted of original members Lorraine Segato (vocals), Dave Gray (guitar), and Steve Webster with new recruits Chris Brown (keyboards), Art Avalos (drums) and Vicki Randle (percussion, backing vocals). Billy Bryans, too ill to perform for the entire show, did join the band on drums for their last two numbers, including &quot;Rise Up&quot;. Bryans, one of three musicians to be part of every Parachute Club line-up, died April 23, 2012, at age 63, following a long battle with cancer.

Partly at Bryans&#x27; insistence that the group continue without him, The Parachute Club decided to stay together to perform gigs. During the 2012 Edmonton (Alberta) Folk Music Festival, the band performed on August 11, 2012, at the volunteer after party and at Stage 2 on August 12. They also played at the Niagara Co-op Expo on October 13, 2012, in St. Catharines, Ontario. For these shows, the Parachute Club now included founding members Lorraine Segato, Dave Gray, Julie Masi, Lauri Conger and Steve Webster. Prior to this reunion, Steve Webster had not played with the group for 27 years, Masi for 25 years and Conger for 24 years.

In 2014, the surviving band members released a contemporary dance remix of &quot;Rise Up&quot;, in conjunction with Toronto&#x27;s hosting of the 2014 edition of WorldPride.

Segato resumed her solo career with series of solo shows in 2014 and a new album in January 2015. Though the band has issued no formal announcement concerning their current status, The Parachute Club has been inactive since 2014. In 2018 and 2019, Segato produced two new supergroup versions of &quot;Rise Up&quot;, one by various Canadian country musicians credited to The Common Cause Collective, and a pop version credited to The New Parachute Collective. In November of 2019 the song Rise Up&quot; was inducted into the Canadian Songwriter&#x27;s Hall of Fame. 2023 saw The Parachute Club inducted into Canada&#x27;s Rock of Fame along with several other notable 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s bands.

<text>Charles Rudolph Boysen (July 14, 1895 – November 25, 1950) was a California horticulturist who created the boysenberry, a hybrid between several varieties of blackberries, raspberries, and loganberries.
==Boysenberry==
Rudolph Boysen had experimented with various berry crosses in Napa, California, during the 1920s. When Boysen first moved to Orange County, he brought berry vines with him which he planted on his in-law’s farm in Anaheim. Boysen worked as Anaheim City Parks superintendent from 1921 to 1950. In 1923, his hybrid grafted successfully and grew to bear fruit. Unable to make his new berry a commercial success, Boysen abandoned his crop after breaking his back in an accident. In 1927, he took specimens to Coolidge Rare Plant Nursery in Altadena. 

Years later, a fellow grower named Walter Knott heard about the berry and tracked down Boysen. Knott was able to bring a few dying vines back to life at his farm, now known as Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm in Buena Park, California. He named the fruit after Boysen.

==Biography==
In 1930, Charles Rudolph Boysen was married to Margaret Bruton (1892–1970). They were the parents of Robert Matt Boysen (1924–1980).
Rudolph Boysen died at the age of 55, and is interred at the Melrose Abbey Cemetery in Anaheim.

==Legacy==
Boysenberry Lane in Placentia, California, and Boysen Avenue in Anaheim, California, are both named for Rudolph Boysen. Boysen Park, a public park in Anaheim, was named in his honor. It features playgrounds, baseball diamonds, a large lawn, and a stucco-coated Grumman F9F-6P Cougar as a children&#x27;s climbing toy. The Anaheim Tennis Center is located adjacent to Boysen Park, located at 951 S. State College Blvd. A garden of desert plants collected by Boysen during several trips to the deserts of southern California, Arizona, and Mexico are showcased at Pearson Park in Anaheim.

<doc id="756197" wikidata="Q3821946" url="?curid=756197" title="Vector signal analyzer">
<text>A vector signal analyzer is an instrument that measures the magnitude and phase of the input signal at a single frequency within the IF bandwidth of the instrument. The primary use is to make in-channel measurements, such as error vector magnitude, code domain power, and spectral flatness, on known signals.

Vector signal analyzers are useful in measuring and demodulating digitally modulated signals like W-CDMA, LTE, and WLAN. These measurements are used to determine the quality of modulation and can be used for design validation and compliance testing of electronic devices.

==Operation==

The vector signal analyzer spectrum analysis process typically has a down-convert &amp; digitizing stage and a DSP &amp; display stage.

===Down-convert and digitize stage===
A vector signal analyzer operates by first down-converting the signal spectra by using superheterodyne techniques.
A portion of the input signal spectrum is down-converted (using a voltage-controlled oscillator and a mixer) to the center frequency of a band-pass filter. The use of a voltage-controlled oscillator allows consideration of different carrier frequencies.

After the conversion to an intermediate frequency, the signal is filtered in order to band-limit the signal and prevent aliasing. The signal is then digitized using an analog-to-digital converter. Sampling rate is often varied in relation to the frequency span under consideration.

===DSP and display stage===
Once the signal is digitized, it is separated into quadrature and in-phase components (I/Q data) using a quadrature detector, which is typically implemented with a discrete Hilbert transform. Several measurements are made and displayed using these signal components and various DSP processes, such as the ones below.

==== Signal spectrum from FFT ====

A FFT is used to compute the frequency spectrum of the signal. Usually there is a windowing function option to limit spectral leakage and enhance frequency resolution. This window is implemented by multiplying it with the digitized values of the sample period before computing the FFT.

==== Constellation diagram ====

A constellation diagram represents a signal modulated by a digital modulation scheme such as quadrature amplitude modulation or phase-shift keying. This diagram maps the magnitude of the quadrature and in-phase components to the vertical and horizontal directions respectively. Qualitative assessments of signal integrity can be made based on interpretation of this diagram.

==== Error vector magnitude ====

By representing the quadrature and in-phase components as the vertical and horizontal axes, the error vector magnitude can be computed as the distance between the ideal and measured constellation points on the diagram. This requires knowledge of the modulated signal in order to compare the received signal with the ideal signal.

===Typical functionality===
Typical vector signal analyzer displays feature the spectrum of the signal measured within the IF bandwidth, a constellation diagram of the demodulated signal, error vector magnitude measurements, and a time-domain plot of the signal. Many more measurement results can be displayed depending on the type of modulation being used (symbol decoding, MIMO measurements, radio frame summary, etc.).

<doc id="756202" wikidata="Q14633326" url="?curid=756202" title="Tube top">
<text>A tube top is a shoulderless, sleeveless garment primarily worn by women that wraps around the upper torso. It is generally tight over the breasts, and usually uses elastic bands at its top and bottom to prevent it from falling. The tube top&#x27;s precursor was a beachwear or informal summer garment worn by young girls in the 1950s that became more widely popular in the 1970s and returned to popularity in the 1990s and 2000s.

In 2012, Iranian-Israeli fashion designer Elie Tahari claimed that he helped popularize the tube top after his arrival in New York in 1971. The original tube tops, as spotted by Tahari in a New York factory run by Murray Kleid, were elasticated gauze tubes reportedly produced through a factory manufacturing error. Murray ran with this product for years, and eventually Tahari bought tubes from Kleid, later setting up his own factory to mass produce tube tops to meet widespread demand.

==Dress code controversies==

In the 2010s, tube tops were banned by some schools (e.g., one New Jersey school&#x27;s dress code banned tube tops as &quot;too &#x27;distracting&#x27; for the eighth grade boys&quot;). In 2018, opponents of these types of clothing bans argued that they are a &quot;form of body shaming&quot; on women and should not be used; in one San Francisco Bay area school district, based on advice from the National Organization for Women, tube tops (along with miniskirts and other formerly disallowed items) are being permitted again.

<doc id="756231" wikidata="Q306631" url="?curid=756231" title="Hitomi (singer)">
<text>, known professionally as , is a Japanese singer-songwriter. She began her career as teen model before making her singing debuting under the helm of Tetsuya Komuro in 1994, who produced Hitomi&#x27;s earliest work in pop music. Hitomi has striven for artistry over the course of her career, penning &quot;forward-looking&quot; lyrics and becoming known for her &quot;unusual&quot; fashion sense that accompanied a &quot;supermodel allure&quot;. Her signature songs include &quot;Candy Girl&quot;, &quot;Love 2000&quot; and &quot;Samurai Drive&quot;.

Hitomi&#x27;s career enjoyed success from Komuro&#x27;s direction, including his work on her chart-topping second album &quot;By Myself&quot; (1996), however, her desire for more artistic input led to their amicable split by 1998. She started working with other musicians and composers, and branched out into musical genres such as pop rock as evident on her fifth album &quot;Love Life&quot; (2000), a turning point which sustained her position in the industry. Hitomi began incorporating electropop styles with her subsequent moves to Love Life Records in 2005 and independent label Maximum 10 in 2011.

Hitomi has amassed four number one albums throughout her career, including &quot;H&quot; (1999), &quot;Huma-rhythm&quot; (2002) and &quot;Self Portrait&quot; (2002), and has sold over 8.5 million records in Japan alone. She has earned two Japan Record Awards for Excellent Work and a Japan Gold Disc accolade for Rock &amp; Pop Album of the Year, and has performed at the prestigious &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot; program twice.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in Tochigi, Japan, her family relocated to Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture when she was a child. Consequently, she always identified herself as a girl from Kanagawa. Hitomi was an enthusiastic athlete throughout her childhood, playing baseball, soccer, and basketball, as well as an avid reader of manga. At age 16, she was spotted and approached by a scout from a modeling agency. She signed a short modeling contract and began appearing in magazines while she was still in high school.

In 1993, then 17 years old, Furuya was spotted by eminent Avex music producer Tetsuya Komuro at an audition. Komuro signed her to Avex, put her through vocal training, and decided that she should use an all-lowercase &#x27;hitomi&#x27; as her stage name. The following year, in November 1994, she released her debut single, &quot;Let&#x27;s Play Winter&quot;, through Avex Trax, to which she wrote the lyrics. Since then, Hitomi has been the lyricist for almost all of her songs.

===Debut and success===
While her first two singles, &quot;Let&#x27;s Play Winter&quot; and &quot;We Are &quot;Lonely Girl&quot;&quot; were considerable failures, her third single &quot;Candy Girl&quot; was used as the theme for a Kodak CM, and secured a top 10 spot on the Japanese Oricon music chart. Subsequent singles &quot;By Myself&quot; and &quot;Busy Now&quot; established Hitomi as one to watch in Japanese entertainment. Her second album &quot;By Myself&quot;, released in 1996, became her first musical work to debut at number one on the Oricon charts; it sold more than 800,000 copies.

After three studio albums and twelve singles, Komuro and Hitomi went their separate ways in 1998, and in 1999 she released her first greatest hits album, entitled &quot;H&quot;, that peaked at number one on the Japanese charts and sold more than a 500 thousand copies.

In 1999, her single &quot;Kimi no Tonari&quot; was used as the ending theme song for Atlus&#x27; PlayStation role-playing game &quot;Persona 2: Tsumi&quot;.

In 2000, Hitomi gained much public attention after her single &quot;Love 2000&quot; was used as the image song of runner Naoko Takahashi, who became popular in Japan after winning the gold medal in the 2000 Summer Olympics. This helped the song to get a lot of airplay, and become a commercial success. She performed the song at the annual &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot;. Her &quot;Love Life&quot; album released around that same time also caught attention within the Japanese entertainment industry because of its cover, on which she appeared naked covering her breasts with her arms.

In 2001, her song &quot;I Am&quot; was used as the second opening for the TV anime series InuYasha.

===2004–2009===
After a one-year and a half hiatus, in May 2004 Hitomi released a new studio album, &quot;Traveler&quot;. The concert tour she subsequently embarked upon was a huge success, and she played to packed arenas at almost every stop. As the 10th anniversary of her debut came in 2005, she opened her own record label, Love Life Records, which functioned as a subdivision of Avex. The first single to be released from the label was &quot;Japanese Girl&quot;, her 28th single, which also marked a change in her style and looks, one that was much more modern dance-oriented and sexy, than any of her previous works.

In 2007, Hitomi obtained her first lead role in the movie &quot;Akumu Tantei&quot;, and also participated in her first musical: &quot;Waiting For The Sun: Tenkimachi&quot;. On December 5, 2007 her singles compilation album &quot;Peace&quot; was released to celebrate her 13th anniversary. She released a new digital single called &quot;Fight for Your Run☆&quot; in August 2008.

After a year on hiatus, she released a new single, &quot;World! Wide! Love!&quot;, on May 20, 2009, and a month later she released her ninth studio album, &quot;Love Life 2&quot;. This album was a spiritual successor to her 2000 album &quot;Love Life&quot;, with Hitomi once again nude on the cover of it, but this time pregnant with her child.

===2011–present: Departure from Avex Trax===
Hitomi&#x27;s last single in the Avex label, &quot;Umarete Kurete Arigato/Smile World&quot;, was released on February 16, 2011. This month she also inaugurated her own baby clothing brand called PomiPomi. On March 28, 2011 it was announced that two new songs, &quot;Special&quot; and &quot;Guru Maze Yeah!&quot; would be used in the NHK educative cartoon &quot;Hana Kappa&quot;, as opening and ending themes respectively.

On April 5, 2011, it was announced that Hitomi had left the Avex major label and had signed to Maximum 10, an independent label affiliated with the Avex company. On April 27, her tenth studio album and first indie album, &quot;Spirit&quot;, was released, it featured mainly productions of western artists such as Rivers Cuomo, Chuck Comeau, Pierre Bouvier and Gabe Saporta. In June, Hitomi started her first live tour in five years, titled &quot;Live Tour 2011: Spirit&quot;.

Despite leaving the Avex label, Hitomi still participated as a featured artist in the tenth anniversary version of their A-Nation. She was part of the line-up of the concerts held in Aichi, Osaka, and Tokio. Her performance was later included in the DVD of A-Nation released in late 2011. In August 2011, Japanese model and occasional singer Mini made a remake of Hitomi&#x27;s hit single &quot;Candy Girl&quot;, which was released as a digital single in September. On November 30, 2011, Hitomi released a new mini album entitled &quot;Special&quot;, in which her songs featured in the NHK educational program &quot;Hana Kappa&quot; were included. This became her last release published by Avex.

Hitomi also collaborated with Sfpr, fellow label mates from Maximum 10, in the song &quot;Feeder&quot;, which was included in their debut album released on January 1, 2012. On October 10, 2012, she released her eleventh album &quot;Möbius&quot; (stylized as ∞). The album had no commercial singles like her previous work, although the Brian Lee-produced song &quot;Up Down&quot; was promoted through a music video via YouTube. In November 2013, it was announced that Hitomi would be performing the theme song for the movie &quot;Kamen Rider × Kamen Rider Gaim &amp; Wizard: The Fateful Sengoku Movie Battle&quot;. The song, entitled &quot;Teppen Star&quot;, was released as her 35th single on December 18, 2013.

On March 18, 2014, Hitomi released a digital single entitled &quot;Bara Yume&quot;. The song featured girl-group MAX on backing vocals, and was meant to be an answer song to her 1995 single &quot;Candy Girl&quot;, as part of the celebration of her 20th anniversary in the music industry. She also performed for the first season of the 2014–2015 slice-of-life anime &quot;GO-GO Tamagotchi!&quot;. She performed a cover of the anime&#x27;s opening theme and new song entitled &quot;Rainbow&quot;, which serves as its ending theme. The 10th episode of &quot;GO-GO Tamagotchi!&quot; features a Tamagotchi character themed off her, named &quot;Hitomitchi&quot;.

In October 2015, it was announced that Hitomi would participate in a tribute album to globe, for which she recorded a cover of their 1997 single &quot;Anytime Smokin&#x27; Cigarette&quot;. The album, entitled &quot;#Globe 20th -Special Cover Best-&quot;, was released on December 16, 2015.

In 2017, Hitomi was appointed to sing the new theme song of NHK&#x27;s Minna no Uta. The song was entitled &quot;Yume Hakonda Randoseru&quot; and was released as a digital single on February 2, 2017. In November 2017, she also started a new radio program called &quot;Hitomi Radio&quot; on Inter FM.

==Personal life==
On December 1, 2002 Hitomi married Keisuke Uesugi, a businessman and former member of hip-hop group Gasboys. They divorced in November 2007. On July 11, 2008, she disclosed her second marriage to actor Masayoshi Haneda, and her four-month pregnancy. She gave birth to a baby girl on December 23, 2008. She and Haneda filed for divorce on December 6, 2011, and it was made public that they had already been living separately for over six months. In June 2014, Hitomi announced that she was five-month pregnant of her second child, a boy, and was engaged to the father. Her third son was born two years later in October 22, 2016, by her third husband as well. In 2020, on her 44th birthday, Hitomi announced her fourth pregnancy.

<text>Spanish Sahara (; ), officially the Spanish Possessions in the Sahara from 1884 to 1958, then Province of the Sahara between 1958 and 1976, was the name used for the modern territory of Western Sahara when it was occupied and ruled by Spain between 1884 and 1976. It had been one of the most recent acquisitions as well as one of the last remaining holdings of the Spanish Empire, which had once extended from the Americas to the Spanish East Indies.

Between 1946 and 1958, the Spanish Sahara was amalgamated with the nearby Spanish-protected Cape Juby and Spanish Ifni to form a new colony, Spanish West Africa. This was reversed during the Ifni War when Ifni and the Sahara became provinces of Spain separately, two days apart, while Cape Juby was ceded to Morocco in the peace deal.

Spain gave up its Saharan possession following Moroccan demands and international pressure, mainly from United Nations resolutions regarding decolonisation. There was internal pressure from the native Sahrawi population, through the Polisario Front, and the claims of Morocco and Mauritania. After gaining independence in 1956, Morocco laid claim to the territory as part of a claimed historic pre-colonial territory. Mauritania also claimed the territory for a number of years on a historical basis.

In 1976, Mauritania and Morocco occupied much of the territory, now known as Western Sahara, but the Polisario Front, promoting the sovereignty of an independent Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, fought a guerrilla war against both, forcing Mauritania to relinquish its claim in 1979. The war against Morocco continued until 1991, when the UN negotiated a ceasefire and has tried to arrange negotiations and a referendum to let the population vote on its future. Morocco controls most of the Atlantic coast and most of the landmass, population and natural resources of Western Sahara.

== Name ==
Officially the territory was called the Province of Sahara from 1958 to 1976. However before 1958 it was divided into three administrative zones, Rio De Oro, the &quot;occupied zone&quot; and the Southern Protectorate

== Spanish period ==

At the Berlin Conference (1884–1885), the European powers were establishing the rules for setting up zones of influence or protection in Africa, and Spain declared &#x27;a protectorate of the African coast&#x27; from Cape Blanc to Cape Bojador on 26 December 1884. It officially informed the other powers in writing on 14 January 1885. It began establishing trading posts and a military presence. In July 1885, King Alfonso XII appointed Emilio Bonelli commissioner of the Río de Oro with civil and military authority. On 6 April 1887, the area was incorporated into the Captaincy General of the Canary Islands for military purposes. In the summer of 1886, under the sponsorship of the Spanish Society of Commercial Geography (&quot;&quot;), Julio Cervera Baviera, Felipe Rizzo (1823–1908) and Francisco Quiroga (1853–1894) traversed the territory, which was called Río de Oro, and made topographical and astronomical observations. At the time, geographers had not mapped the territory and its features were not widely known. Their trek is considered the first scientific expedition in that part of the Sahara.

On entering the territory in 1884, Spanish forces were immediately challenged by stiff resistance from the indigenous Sahrawi tribes, Saharan Berbers who lived in many oases and coastal villages. The indigenous people worked mainly in fishing and camel herding, and speak the Hassaniya language, a Bedouin Arabic dialect. A rebellion in 1904 was led by the powerful Smara-based &quot;marabout&quot;, Shaykh Ma al-&#x27;Aynayn, was put down by France in 1910, which ruled neighbouring Algeria. This was followed by a wave of uprisings under Ma al-Aynayn&#x27;s sons, grandsons and other political leaders.

In 1886, Spain signed the Treaty of Idjil, by which the Emirate of Adrar ceded the land of the colony to Spain. This treaty was of no legal value, since the Emir had no claim to the territory, the Spanish &#x27;invented&#x27; a claim which the Emir could, with no harm to himself, immediately cede.

Morocco asserts that the territory was under Moroccan royal sovereignty at the time when the Spanish claimed it in 1884. The country raises to back its claims two sixteenth-century treaties, the Treaty of Alcáçovas and the Treaty of Cintra, between Spain and Portugal, where both countries recognize that the authority of Morocco extended beyond Cabo Bojador. Other treaties extending the authority further south are also raised, like the one between the Sharifian sultanate and Spain of 1 March 1767 or the Anglo-Moroccan Agreement of 13 March 1895. However, the International Court of Justice found in their Advisory opinion on Western Sahara of 1975 that those treaties only proved ties of allegiance (Bay&#x27;ah) between this territory and the Kingdom of Morocco, and were not legal ties extending to sovereignty over the territory.

The borders of the territory were not clearly defined until treaties between Spain and France in the early 20th century. Spanish Sahara was created from the Spanish territories of Río de Oro and Saguia el-Hamra in 1924. It was not part of the areas known as Spanish Morocco and was administered separately.

== Modern history ==

After gaining independence in 1956, Morocco laid claim to Spanish Sahara as part of its historic pre-colonial territory. In 1957, the Moroccan Army of Liberation nearly occupied the small territory of Ifni, north of Spanish Sahara, during the Ifni War. The Spanish sent a regiment of paratroopers from the nearby Canary Islands and repelled the attacks. With the assistance of the French, Spain soon re-established control in the area through &quot;Operaciones Teide-Ecoubillon&quot; (Spanish name) / &quot;Opérations Ecouvillon&quot; (French name).

Spain tried to suppress resistance politically. It forced some of the previously nomadic inhabitants of Spanish Sahara to settle in certain areas, and the rate of urbanisation was increased. In 1958, Spain united the territories of Saguia el-Hamra and Río de Oro to form the overseas province of Spanish Sahara, while ceding the province of the Cape Juby strip (which included Villa Bens) in the same year to Morocco.

In the 1960s, Morocco continued to claim Spanish Sahara. It gained agreement by the United Nations to add the territory to the list of territories to be decolonised. In 1969, Spain ceded Ifni to Morocco, but continued to retain Spanish Sahara.

In 1967, Spanish rule was challenged by the &quot;Harakat Tahrir&quot;, a Sahrawi movement created by Muhammad Bassiri. In 1970, Spain suppressed the Zemla Intifada.

In 1973, the Polisario Front was formed in a revival of militant Sahrawi nationalism. The Front&#x27;s guerrilla army grew rapidly, and Spain lost effective control over most of the territory by early 1975. Its effort to found a political rival, the &quot;Partido de Unión Nacional Saharaui&quot; (PUNS), met with little success. Spain proceeded to co-opt tribal leaders by setting up the &quot;Djema&#x27;a&quot;, a political institution loosely based on traditional Sahrawi tribal leaders. The &quot;Djema&#x27;a&quot; members were hand-picked by the authorities, but given privileges in return for rubber-stamping Madrid&#x27;s decisions.

In the winter of 1975, just before the death of its long-time dictator Generalissimo Francisco Franco, Spain was confronted with an intensive campaign of territorial demands from Morocco and, to a lesser extent, from Mauritania. These culminated in the &quot;Marcha Verde&quot; (&#x27;Green March&#x27;), where a mass demonstration of 350 000 Moroccans coordinated by the Moroccan Government advanced several kilometres into the Western Sahara territory, bypassing the International Court of Justice&#x27;s &quot;Advisory opinion on Western Sahara&quot; that had been issued three weeks prior. After negotiating the Madrid Accords with Morocco and Mauritania, Spain withdrew its forces and citizens from the territory.

Morocco and Mauritania took control of the region. Mauritania later surrendered its claim after fighting an unsuccessful war against the Polisario Front. In the process of annexing the region, Morocco started fighting the Polisario Front, and after sixteen years, the UN negotiated a cease-fire in 1991. Today, the sovereignty of the territory remains in dispute between Morocco and the Sahrawi people, and referendum has not been possible to date due to dispute over who can vote.

== Present status ==

Western Sahara is listed by the United Nations (UN) as a non-decolonized territory and is thus included in the United Nations list of non-self-governing territories. Under international law, Western Sahara is not a legal part of Morocco, and it remains under the international laws of military occupation.

Moroccan settlers currently make up more than two thirds of the inhabitants of the territory. Under international law, Morocco&#x27;s transfer of its own civilians into occupied territory is in direct violation of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.

UN peace efforts have been directed at holding a referendum on independence among the Sahrawi population, but this has not yet taken place. The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic has been recognized by 84 UN member states and the African Union (of which it is a founding member).

<doc id="756263" wikidata="Q56490299" url="?curid=756263" title="Bluestone">
<text>Bluestone is a cultural or commercial name for a number of natural dimension or building stone varieties, including:

* basalt in Victoria, Australia, and in New Zealand
* dolerites in Tasmania, Australia; and in Britain (including Stonehenge)
* feldspathic sandstone in the US and Canada 
* limestone in the Shenandoah Valley in the US, from the Hainaut quarries in Soignies, Belgium, and from quarries in County Carlow, County Galway and County Kilkenny in Ireland
* slate in South Australia
It is unrelated to human-made blue brick.

==Stonehenge==
The term &quot;bluestone&quot; in Britain is used in a loose sense to cover all of the &quot;foreign,&quot; not intrinsic, stones and rock debris at Stonehenge. It is a &quot;convenience&quot; label rather than a geological term, since at least 46 different rock types are represented. One of the most common rocks in the assemblage is known as Preseli Spotted Dolerite—a chemically altered igneous rock containing spots or clusters of secondary minerals replacing plagioclase feldspar. It is a medium grained dark and heavy rock, harder than granite. 

Preseli bluestone tools, such as axes, have been discovered elsewhere within the British Isles. Many of them appear to have been made in or near Stonehenge, since there are petrographic similarities with some of the spotted dolerites there. The bluestones at Stonehenge were first used there during the third phase of construction at Stonehenge around 2300 BC. It is assumed that there were about 80 monoliths originally, but this has never been proven since only 43 remain. The stones are estimated to weigh between 2 and 4 tons each. The majority of them are believed to have come from the Preseli Hills, about 250km (150 miles) away in Wales, either through glaciation (glacial erratic theory) or through humans organizing their transportation.

===Glacial erratic theory===
A summary of the major aspects of the Stonehenge &quot;bluestone conundrum&quot; was published in 2008. In 2018 a book devoted specifically to the problem of bluestone provenance and transport concluded that the Stonehenge bluestones are essentially an ill-sorted assemblage of glacial erratics. Much further research into the origin of the bluestones has been published between 2012 and 2022 particularly by geologists Richard Bevins and Rob Ixer. If a glacier transported the stones, then it must have been the Irish Sea Glacier. In support of the glacial erratic theory, researchers reporting in 2015 found no firm evidence of quarrying at Rhosyfelin in the Preselis. However, in such event, one might expect to find other bluestone boulders or slabs near the Stonehenge site, but no such bluestones (apart from fragments) have been found.

===Human transport theory===
The archaeological find of the Boscombe Bowmen has been cited in support of the human transport theory. Preseli Bluestone dolerite axe heads have been found around the Preseli Hills as well, indicating that there was a population who knew how to work with the stones, In 2015, researchers claimed that some of the stones at Stonehenge came from Neolithic quarries at Carn Goedog and Craig Rhos-y-felin in the Preseli Hills. The quarrying hypothesis has been hotly disputed by Brian John, Dyfed Elis-Gruffydd and John Downes, whose own detailed research led to the conclusion that the so-called quarrying features were all natural, created over a long period of glacial and periglacial landscape change. Further, no independent evidence has ever been found to support the thesis of long overland or sea transport of Preseli bluestones from Wales to Salisbury Plain.

==Australia==
There are three distinct building materials called &quot;bluestone&quot; in Australia.

===Victoria ===
In Victoria, what is known as bluestone is a basalt or olivine basalt. It was one of the favoured building materials during the Victorian Gold Rush period of the 1850s. In Melbourne, it was extracted from quarries throughout the inner northern suburbs, such as Clifton Hill, Brunswick and Coburg, where the quarry used to source the stone for Pentridge Prison is now Coburg Lake. Bluestone was also sourced in many other regions of the Victorian volcanic plains, and used in towns and cities in the state&#x27;s central and western regions, including Ballarat, Geelong, Kyneton, Port Fairy and Portland. It is still quarried at a number of places around the state.

Bluestone is a very hard material and therefore difficult to work, so it was predominantly used for warehouses, miscellaneous walls, and the foundations of buildings. However, a number of significant bluestone buildings exist, including the Old Melbourne Gaol, Pentridge Prison, St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Victoria Barracks, Melbourne Grammar School, Deaf Children Australia and Victorian College for the Deaf, Vision Australia, the Goldsbrough Mort warehouses (Bourke Street) and the Timeball Tower at Williamstown, as well as St Mary&#x27;s Basilica in Geelong. Some examples of other major structures that use bluestone include Princes Bridge, the adjacent Federation Wharf, and Hawthorn Bridge. Because of its distinctive qualities, post-modern Melbourne buildings have also made use of bluestone for nostalgic reasons. They include the Southgate complex and the promenade in Southbank, Victoria.

Bluestone was used extensively as cobblestone, and for kerbs and gutters, many examples of which still exist in Melbourne&#x27;s smaller city lanes, and 19th-century inner-suburban streets and lanes. Crushed bluestone aggregate, known as &quot;blue metal&quot; (or &quot;bluemetal&quot;), is used extensively in Victoria as railway ballast, as road base, and in making concrete. Combined with bitumen, it is used as a road surfacing material.

===South Australia===
In South Australia, the name bluestone is given to a form of slate which is much less durable than Victorian bluestone, but was valued for its decorative appearance. The interior of the stone is usually pale grey or beige in colour, but is given attractively coloured surfaces by ferric oxide and other minerals deposited in joints and bedding planes. The slate is laid in masonry with the mineralised surfaces exposed. Bluestone was most popular from about the 1850s to the 1920s, quarried in the Adelaide Hills at Dry Creek, O&#x27;Halloran Hill (formerly Tapley&#x27;s Hill) and Glen Osmond, as well as a number of other places in rural areas.

===Tasmania===
In Tasmania, the name bluestone is given to dolerite (diabase), which is a dominant stone variety in the landscape, and used in a variety of building roles.

==New Zealand==
Timaru bluestone (also known as Port Chalmers bluestone) is an attractive building material, used both historically and to the present. It is a grey basalt similar to Victorian bluestone, quarried near Timaru in the South Island. Bluestone from near Kokonga in Central Otago is also widely used, and is the main construction material (often with facing of Oamaru stone, a local compact limestone) in many of the notable historic buildings in the southern South Island, most of which were constructed during the financial boom following the Otago gold rush. Prominent structures to use this combination include Otago University Registry Building, Dunedin Law Courts, and Dunedin Railway Station. Similar construction using Timaru bluestone was used for Christchurch Arts Centre.

==United States and Canada==

There are two distinct building materials called &quot;bluestone&quot; in the United States, one of which is also found in Canada.

Bluestone from Pennsylvania and New York is a sandstone defined as feldspathic greywacke. The sand-sized grains from which bluestone is constituted were deposited in the Catskill Delta during the Middle to Upper Devonian Period of the Paleozoic Era, approximately 370 to 345 million years ago. The Catskill Delta was created from runoff from the Acadian Mountains (&quot;Ancestral Appalachians&quot;). This delta ran in a narrow band from southwest to northeast and today provides the bluestone quarried from the Catskill Mountains and Northeastern Pennsylvania. The term &quot;bluestone&quot; is derived from a deep-blue-colored sandstone first found in Ulster County, New York. It can, however, appear in many other hues, mostly shades of grays and browns. Bluestone quarrying is of particular value to the economy of Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania. The Starrucca Viaduct, finished in 1848, is an example of Pennsylvania bluestone as a building material. Bluestone is quarried in western New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and eastern New York. It is also quarried in the Canadian Appalachians near Deer Lake in Western Newfoundland. The Pennsylvania Bluestone Association has 105 members, the vast majority of them quarriers. 

The other, lesser known, type of American &quot;bluestone&quot; is a blue-tinted limestone abundant in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. It is a limestone formed during the Ordovician Period approximately 450 to 500 million years ago, at the bottom of a relatively shallow ocean that covered what is today Rockingham County, Virginia. The limestone that accumulated there was darker in color than most other limestone deposits because it was in deeper waters exposed to less light. The darker blue color resulted in limestone from this region being dubbed &quot;bluestone&quot; and with two sequences measuring about thick, it gives the area one of the largest limestone deposits in the world. The stone eventually fades from a deep blue to a light grey after prolonged exposure to sun and rain. Given the abundance of the stone in the Rockingham County area, the first settlers used it as foundations and chimneys for their houses. When James Madison University was built, the local bluestone was used to construct the buildings because of its high quality and cultural heritage.

<text>Mount Street Gardens is a public garden off Mount Street in the west of the Mayfair area of London, England. The gardens were created in 1889 out of a former burial ground of St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square, and named after the Mount Field, an area including a fortification dating from the English Civil War named Oliver&#x27;s Mount.

Several structures in and adjacent to the gardens are listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England. These include the fountain, two cisterns, and the two K2 telephone kiosks and the Portland stone gate piers with lamps at the entrance by South Audley Street.

==Burial ground and workhouse==
The land was originally sold by Sir Richard Grosvenor, 4th Bart. to the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches in 1723 as part of his development of the area around Mount Street, to serve as a burial ground for the parish church, St. George&#x27;s, located in Hanover Square. Beside the burial ground, on South Audley Street, was planned the Grosvenor Chapel, but this was not built until 7 years after the burial ground was laid out, in 1730.

To the north of the ground, the site of what is now 103 Mount Street, was the parish&#x27;s workhouse, wherein the poor were given work, board, and lodgings, built in 1725 and then enlarged in the 1780s to provide room for the parish watchmen&#x27;s watch-house and the parish office.

In the 1850s, Parliament passed a series of Burial Acts by which burial grounds in central London, such as that of St. George&#x27;s, were to be closed due to health risks. The parish&#x27;s other burial ground, on Bayswater Road, closed shortly afterwards, and the City of Westminster Cemetery, Hanwell in west London was used instead.

As the population of London grew, so did the demand upon the workhouse, and it became so overcrowded that in 1871 the decision was taken to move the workhouse to a new site, spurred on also by plans to widen Mount Street. In 1883, some land for the new workhouse on Buckingham Palace Road was bought from the new Duke of Westminster, Hugh Grosvenor, thricely-great-grand-nephew of the Baronet who originally sold the site of the burial ground, and paupers were transferred both to there and the parish&#x27;s other workhouse at Little Chelsea on the Fulham Road, with the workhouse finally being demolished in 1886 and converted into more parish offices.

==Development as a public space==
After the demolition of the workhouse, the whole area was somewhat redeveloped; Carlos Place (then named Charles Street) was to be extended to the south of Mount Street over the site of the workhouse&#x27;s chapel for access to the Church of the Immaculate Conception on Farm Street. The church, built between 1844 and 1849, was in a decorated gothic-style, designed by Joseph John Scoles, and with the altar by A.W.N. Pugin, and is now a Grade II* listed building. However, the new road planned through the disused burial ground was never built.

The gardens&#x27; footpaths are those originally created in 1889, and the bronze drinking fountain of a rearing horse was designed for the local estate agent Henry Lofts in 1891 by Harold Peto and Sir Ernest George, who was also the designer of 104-111 Mount Street. As of 2005, the fountain is largely removed for restoration.

The gravestones had been removed to the gardens&#x27; tool shed, but when the shed itself was demolished in 1931 to make way for the Mayfair telephone exchange between the gardens and Farm Street, the City Engineer&#x27;s office made a copy of the inscriptions, now stored in City of Westminster Archives Centre, along with other records from the Parish.

The paths in the gardens are lined with benches, many of which have been donated by the families of US citizens who have enjoyed the gardens whilst based at the nearby US embassy and other US institutions nearby.

==Flora and fauna==
The garden has a number of London plane (&quot;Platanus × hispanica&quot;) trees, the predominant tree throughout central London due to their ability to cope with the capital&#x27;s formerly heavily polluted air. Other trees, some able to grow only due to the gardens&#x27; sheltered spot and warm climate, include an Australian silver wattle (&quot;Acacia dealbata&quot;) and a Canary Islands date palm (&quot;Phoenix canariensis&quot;), three dawn redwood (&quot;Metasequola glyptostroboides&quot;) from south-east China, and a form of twisted willow, &quot;Salix matsudana&quot; &#x27;Tortuosa&#x27;, from northern China, as well as a chusan palm (&quot;Trachycarpus fortunei&quot;), a common palm in the UK due to its hardiness.

Underneath these trees are planted a number of shrubs, most noticeably laurels (&quot;Aucuba japonica&quot;) and hollies (such as &quot;Ilex aquifolium&quot;), and several camellias (&quot;Camellia japonica&quot;) and a &quot;Fatsia japonica&quot;.

The gardens provides homes for a number of birds, including great tits, robins, magpies, blackbirds and goldcrests.

<text>Geordan Edward Andrew Murphy (born 19 April 1978) is an Irish rugby union rugby coach and player who retired from the professional game as the most-decorated man in Premiership Rugby history. He played as fullback or wing for the Irish international team and the English club Leicester Tigers as well as for the British &amp; Irish Lions.

==Youth==
Murphy was born in Dublin, Ireland. He was officially named George after his father but his mother called him Geordan to avoid confusion. His six brothers and sister all played rugby union. Murphy was educated at Newbridge College, Newbridge, County Kildare before attending Waterford Institute of Technology and De Montfort University in Leicester.

Murphy played Gaelic football at Minor (U18) level with Kildare GAA in the All-Ireland Minor Football Championship.

==Playing career==
In 1997 shortly before he joined Leicester Tigers, Murphy gained his first U19 cap for Ireland, playing his club rugby with Naas. He gradually made his way into the Tigers&#x27; first team squad, while gaining caps for Ireland U21. Opportunities at fullback were limited by the presence of Tim Stimpson, but he gained a place on the right wing. Murphy started in both of Leicester&#x27;s back-to-back Heineken Cup final wins in 2001 and 2002, scoring a try in the latter final. He also helped Leicester win four Premiership trophies in a row in 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002.

Murphy broke his leg in Ireland&#x27;s last warm-up game against Scotland at Murrayfield prior to the 2003 Rugby Union World Cup and did not compete. Two years later, however, he toured New Zealand with the British &amp; Irish Lions, gaining two Test caps against Argentina and the All Blacks.

Murphy won his fifth Premiership medal in 2007, starting the final as Leicester defeated Gloucester.

As he matured, Murphy preferred full back over wing. His main rivals for the Ireland full back starting position were Girvan Dempsey and Rob Kearney. In his autobiography he stated that he had a poor working relationship with former Ireland Coach Eddie O&#x27;Sullivan mainly because he played for an English team. Murphy was named as the starting full back for Ireland in the crucial game against Argentina on 22 November 2008, and scored one of Ireland&#x27;s two tries in that game.

He was a member of the Ireland team that won the 2009 Six Nations Championship and Grand Slam. In May 2009, Murphy was named in the Barbarians squad to play England and Australia along with Ireland teammate Gordon D&#x27;Arcy.

He took over the Tigers captaincy on the field in the 2008/09 season, when club captain Martin Corry was not in the team, and led them to two finals that season – Heineken Cup and English Premiership, the latter of which they won. The following season, he was named official club captain, though missed out on much of the season due to injury. He returned in February, to lead the team to a successive Guinness Premiership title, when the Tigers beat Saracens 33–27 in the final.

Murphy was chosen to captain Ireland against the in June 2010. On 11 September Murphy was picked to start in the first match of the 2011 Rugby World Cup since Rob Kearney was injured. Ireland won the game 22–10 against the United States. He came on then to replace Keith Earls in the Russia game.

In May 2012, Murphy announced his retirement from international rugby, and in May 2013, retired from playing all forms of the game after collecting the eighth Premiership title of his career, though he did not play in the Final win over Northampton that season.

==Coaching==
Murphy joined the staff as an assistant coach at Leicester from the 2013–14 season onwards. He masterminded Tigers winning of the 2016–17 Anglo-Welsh Cup, the first Tigers trophy won in the period Murphy was part of the coaching team.

He acted as head coach for the September 2017 game versus Bath as new head coach Matt O&#x27;Connor had only just arrived.

Murphy was placed in formal interim charge of Leicester Tigers on 3 September 2018 following the sacking of O&#x27;Connor. This position was made permanent in December 2018.

He was promoted to director of rugby on 1 July 2020 with the appointment of Steve Borthwick as head coach.

His contract was terminated ahead of the 2020–21 season.

== Honours ==
Leicester:

2x European (Heineken) Cup- 2001, 2002

8x Gallagher Premiership- 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2013

<text>An entrenched clause or entrenchment clause of a constitution is a provision that makes certain amendments either more difficult or impossible to pass. Overriding an entrenched clause may require a supermajority, a referendum, or the consent of the minority party. The term eternity clause is used in a similar manner in the constitutions of Brazil, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, India, Iran, Italy, Morocco, Norway, and Turkey, but specifically applies to an entrenched clause that can never be overridden. However, if a constitution provides for a mechanism of its own abolition or replacement, like the German Basic Law does in Article 146, this by necessity provides a &quot;back door&quot; for getting rid of the &quot;eternity clause&quot;, too. 

Any amendment to a constitution that would not satisfy the prerequisites enshrined in a valid entrenched clause would lead to so-called &quot;unconstitutional constitutional law&quot;—that is, an amendment to constitutional law text that appears constitutional by its form, albeit unconstitutional due to the procedure used to enact it or due to the content of its provisions.

Entrenched clauses are, in some cases, seen as justified as protecting the rights of a minority from the dangers of majoritarianism. In other cases, the objective may be to prevent amendments to the constitution that would pervert the fundamental principles it enshrines. However, entrenched clauses are often challenged by their opponents as being undemocratic.

==Africa==

===Algeria===

The Algerian Constitution of 2016 contains clauses about the term limit and the duration of the presidential term.

===Egypt===
Article 226 of the Constitution of Egypt, defining the amendment procedure, ends with an entrenched clause stating that &quot;In all cases, texts pertaining to the re-election of the president of the republic or the principles of freedom and equality stipulated in this Constitution may not be amended, unless the amendment brings more guarantees.&quot;

This clause failed to block the 2019 amendments that replaced the hard two-term limit for presidents with a consecutive one, and the modification of the term&#x27;s duration from four to six years. The article also failed to block a new article from being added that excludes incumbent president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi from the two consecutive terms constraint, enabling him to run for a third term.

===Morocco===
In the Constitution of Morocco, eternity clauses exist that ensure certain provisions cannot be amended, including the role of Islam in the nation&#x27;s law, and the role of the King of Morocco in law.

===South Africa===
There are several examples of entrenched clauses that ultimately failed in their objectives, since their protections were undermined in unintended ways. For instance, the South Africa Act, the initial constitution of the Union of South Africa, contained entrenchment clauses protecting voting rights in the Cape Province, including those of some Coloureds, that required two-thirds of a joint session of parliament to be repealed. The Coloureds, however, later lost their voting rights after the Government restructured the Senate and packed it with its sympathisers so that they were able to achieve said supermajority in what is known as the Coloured vote constitutional crisis.

===Tunisia===

The Tunisian Constitution of 2014 prohibits amending the constitution to change the duration of a presidential term or the maximum number of terms an individual can serve.

==Americas==

===Brazil===
Entrenched clauses of the Constitution of Brazil are listed in Article 60, Paragraph 4:
There are other clauses that implicitly cannot be amended, mostly because they are dependent of the subjects above.

===Canada===
The amendment formula for the Constitution of Canada (sections 38-49 of the Constitution Act, 1982) contains multiple levels of entrenchment, but the issues most firmly entrenched (which can only be changed by the federal government with the unanimous consent of all provinces) under section 41 are the monarchy, each province&#x27;s minimum allocation of representatives in Parliament, English-French bilingualism, the composition of the Supreme Court of Canada, and section 41 itself.

===Honduras===
The Constitution of Honduras has an article stating that the article itself and certain other articles cannot be changed in any circumstances. Article 374 of the Honduras Constitution asserts this unmodifiability, stating, &quot;It is not possible to reform, in any case, the preceding article, the present article, the constitutional articles referring to the form of government, to the national territory, to the presidential period, the prohibition to serve again as President of the Republic, the citizen who has performed under any title in consequence of which she/he cannot be President of the Republic in the subsequent period.&quot; This unmodifiable article played an important role in the 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis.

===United States===

Article V of the United States Constitution temporarily shielded certain clauses in Article I from being amended. The first clause in Section 9, which prevented Congress from passing any law that would restrict the importation of slaves prior to 1808, and the fourth clause in that same section, a declaration that direct taxes must be apportioned according to the state populations, were explicitly shielded from constitutional amendment prior to 1808.

Article V also shields the first clause of Article I, Section 3, which provides for equal representation of the states in the United States Senate, from being amended. This has been interpreted to require unanimous ratification of any amendment altering the composition of the Senate. However, the text of the clause would indicate that the size of the Senate could be changed by an ordinary amendment if each state continued to have equal representation. Alternatively, Article V theoretically could be amended to remove such an entrenched clause designation, and then the clause could be amended itself.

The Crittenden Compromise and Corwin Amendment, both proposed in the months leading up to the Civil War but never passed, would have enshrined slavery in the Constitution and prevented Congress from interfering with it.

==Asia and Oceania==

===Australia===

As Australian Parliaments have inherited the British principle of parliamentary sovereignty, they may not entrench themselves by a regular act. Therefore, the entrenchment of the national flag in the &quot;Flags Act&quot; of 1953 is without force as the entrenchment clause could be removed (through normal legislative amendment) by later parliaments.

The Commonwealth Constitution is entrenched as it may only be amended by referendum; the amendment must gain the support of a majority of Australian voters nationwide, plus a majority of voters in a majority of states. These provisions are specified in section 128. The Imperial Parliament&#x27;s power to amend it in Australian law was limited by the &quot;Statute of Westminster Adoption Act&quot; 1942 and terminated by the &quot;Australia Act&quot; 1986.

State laws respecting the constitution, powers or procedure of the parliament of a state need to follow any restrictions specified in state law on such acts, by virtue of section 6 of the &quot;Australia Act&quot;. This power does not extend to the whole constitution of the state, and the Parliament of Queensland has ignored entrenchments in amending its constitution. Consequently, it is possible that the entrenchment clauses are unentrenchable, preventing state law from having effectively entrenching clauses.

===India===
The Supreme Court has developed the basic structure doctrine which holds that certain features of the constitution are fundamental in nature and cannot be modified through parliamentary amendment. The Supreme Court has yet to clearly delimit which, if any, provisions constitute the components of the basic structure.

===Indonesia===
Article 37 on Chapter 16 of the Constitution of Indonesia governs the constitutional amendment procedure, yet it also specifies that the status of Indonesia as a unitary state is unmodifiable. The Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Defense as well as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also stated within the Constitution to not be dissolvable.

===Iran===
The final Article of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Art. 177, ensures that particular aspects of the Constitution are unalterable. These include the Islamic character of the government and laws, the objectives of the republic, the democratic character of the government, &quot;the absolute wilayat al-&#x27;amr and the leadership of the Ummah&quot;, the administration of the country by referendum, and the role of Islam as the state religion.

===Malaysia===
Another example of entrenchment would be the entrenching of portions of the Malaysian Constitution related to the Malaysian social contract, which specifies that citizenship be granted to the substantial Chinese and Indian immigrant populations in return for the recognition of a special position for the indigenous Malay majority. The Constitution did not initially contain an entrenched clause; indeed, one of the articles later entrenched, Article 153, was initially intended to be subject to a sunset clause. However, after the May 13 incident of racial rioting in 1969, Parliament passed the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1971. The Act permitted criminalisation of the questioning of Articles 152, 153, 181, and Part III of the Constitution.

Article 152 designates the Malay language as the national language of Malaysia; Article 153 grants the Malays special privileges; Article 181 covers the position of the Malay rulers; and Part III deals with matters of citizenship. The restrictions, which even covered Members of Parliament, made the repeal of these sections of the Constitution unamendable or repealable by &quot;de facto&quot;; however, to entrench them further, the Act also amended Article 159(5), which covers Constitutional amendments, to prohibit the amending of the aforementioned Articles, as well as Article 159(5), without the consent of the Conference of Rulers — a non-elected body comprising the rulers of the Malay states and the governors of the other states.

===New Zealand===
Section 268 of the Electoral Act (part of the Constitution of New Zealand) declares that the law governing the maximum term of Parliament, along with certain provisions of the Electoral Act relating to the redistribution of electoral boundaries, the voting age, and the secret ballot, may only be altered either by three-quarters of the entire membership of the House of Representatives, or by a majority of valid votes in a popular referendum. 

However, Section 268 is not itself protected by this provision, so a government could legally repeal Section 268 and go on to alter the entrenched portions of law, both with a simple majority in Parliament.

=== Sri Lanka ===
In Sri Lanka, the Constitution includes entrenched provisions that require both a two-thirds majority in Parliament and a nationwide referendum for amendment. These entrenched provisions, specified in Article 83 of the Constitution, include the following:

* Articles safeguarding the unitary state (Article 2), sovereignty of the people (Article 3), freedom of religion and thought (Articles 9, 10, and 11), and symbols of the nation such as the national flag and anthem (Articles 6, 7, and 8).
* Provisions related to the term limits of the President (Article 30(2)) and the duration of Parliament (Article 62(2)), but only when these limits are extended to over six years. If these terms are shortened, a referendum is not required.
* Article 83 itself, which governs the requirement for a referendum for amending these entrenched provisions.

===Turkey===
Article 4 of the Constitution of Turkey states that the &quot;provision of Article 1 of the Constitution establishing the form of the state as a Republic, the provisions in Article 2 on the characteristics of the Republic, and the provision of Article 3 shall not be amended, nor shall their amendment be proposed.&quot;

==Europe==

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===

Article X of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, defining the amendment procedure, provides in paragraph 2 that the rights and freedoms as established in Article II of the Constitution may not be eliminated or diminished, and that the paragraph 2 itself may not be altered.

===Czech Republic===
Article 9 of the Czech Constitution, which concerns supplementing and amending the Constitution, states that &quot;the substantive requisites of the democratic, law-abiding State may not be amended&quot;. This provision was invoked in 2009 when the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic struck down a Constitutional Act adopted to invoke a one-off early legislative election. The disputed Act was judged to be an individual decision in violation of then-effective constitutional procedure regulating early elections.

The Constitution also contains an explicit eternity clause whereby the Constitutional Court is the ultimate arbiter of the effect of European law on the Constitution.

===Estonia===

Article 1 of Estonian Constitution states that &quot;The independence and sovereignty of Estonia are timeless and inalienable.&quot; As part of Chapter 1 of the Constitution, this provision may only be changed by a referendum (and such a referendum could only be organized after obtaining a 3/5 supermajority in the parliament). This provision, however, does not prevent Estonia from being a member of the European Union and delegating some of its decision-making power to central EU institutions as long as &quot;fundamental constitutional principles&quot; are not breached (according to the special Constitution Amendment Act passed on a referendum in 2003).

===France===
The French Constitution states in Title XVI, Article 89, On Amendments to the Constitution, &quot;The republican form of government shall not be the object of any amendment&quot; thus forbidding the restoration of the monarchy or the empire.

===Germany===
The German eternity clause (German: &quot;Ewigkeitsklausel&quot;) is Article 79 paragraph (3) of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany (German: &quot;Grundgesetz&quot;). The eternity clause establishes that certain fundamental principles of Germany&#x27;s democracy can never be removed, even by parliament. The fundamental principles, (i.e., &quot;the basic principles&quot; of Articles 1 and 20), are as follows:

* Duty of all state authority: &quot;The dignity of man is inviolable. To respect and protect it is the duty of all state authority.&quot; (Article 1)
* Acknowledgement of human rights: &quot;The German people therefore acknowledge inviolable and inalienable human rights as the basis of every community, of peace and of justice in the world.&quot; (Article 1 Paragraph 2)
* Directly enforceable law: &quot;The following basic rights bind the legislature, the executive and judiciary as directly enforceable law.&quot; (Article 1 Paragraph 3)
* Republic (form of government): (Article 20 Paragraph 1)
* Federal state &quot;(Länder)&quot;: (Article 20 Paragraph 1)
* Social state (welfare state): (Article 20 Paragraph 1)
* Sovereignty of the People: &quot;All state authority emanates from the People.&quot; (Article 20 Paragraph 2)
* Democratic: &quot;All state authority is exercised by the people by means of elections and voting and by specific legislative, executive and judicial organs.&quot; (Article 20 Paragraph 2)
* Rule of law &quot;(Rechtsstaat)&quot;: &quot;Legislation is subject to the constitutional order. The executive and judiciary are bound by the law.&quot; (Article 20 Paragraph 3)
* Separation of powers: &quot;Specific legislative, executive and judicial organs&quot;, each &quot;bound by the law&quot;. (Article 20 Paragraphs 2–3)

The original purpose of this eternity clause was to ensure that the establishment of any dictatorship in Germany would be clearly illegal; in legal practice the clause was used by plaintiffs at the Federal Constitutional Court challenging constitutional amendments that affected Articles 1, 10, 19, 101, and 103 regarding restrictions of legal recourse. Although these basic principles are protected from being repealed, their particular expression may still be amended, such as to clarify, extend or refine an entrenched principle.

The &quot;Parlamentarischer Rat&quot; (Parliamentary Council) included the eternity clause in its Basic Law specifically to prevent a new &quot;legal&quot; pathway to a dictatorship as was the case in the Weimar Republic with the Enabling Act of 1933 and Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution.

It is not lawful for any political party, any legislation or any national commitment to violate &quot;the basic principles&quot; of &quot;this Basic Law&quot; laid down in Articles 1 and 20. Furthermore, the only way that Articles 1 and 20 can be removed is through Article 146, which requires &quot;a constitution that is adopted by a free decision of the German People&quot;. So long as the principles of Articles 1 and 20 are retained, they may be amended (as Article 20 has indeed been amended to establish a &#x27;right of resistance&#x27;), but the full protection of the eternity clause does not extend to such amendments.

Unlike the Weimar Constitution, which made human rights only an objective, the eternity clause and Articles 1 and 20 make specific demands of &quot;all state authority&quot; regarding &quot;human rights&quot; (that is, &quot;the basic rights&quot; guaranteed in &quot;this Basic Law&quot;) and have established specific legislative, executive and judicial organs in &quot;the constitutional order&quot; of &quot;this Basic Law&quot;, each with separate functions bound by the law. These are &quot;the basic principles&quot; of the democratic rule of law (German: &quot;Rechtsstaat&quot;) and the separation of powers, which are principles endorsed by three United Nations resolutions.

===Greece===
The Greek eternity clause is Article 110 of the Greek Constitution. This article states that every article of the Constitution can be revised by the Parliament, with the exception of the fundamental ones, which establish Greece as a parliamentary republic and those of articles 2 paragraph 1, article 4 paragraphs 1, 4 and 7, article 5 paragraphs 1 and 3, article 13 paragraph 1 and article 26. These fundamental articles include:

* Republic (form of government): &quot;The form of government of Greece is that of a parliamentary republic.&quot; Art. 1 Para. (1);
* Sovereignty of the people: &quot;Popular sovereignty is the foundation of government.&quot; Art. 1 Para. (2);
* Democracy: &quot;All powers derive from the People and exist for the People and the Nation; they shall be exercised as specified by the Constitution.&quot; Art. 1 Para. (3);
* Duty of all state authority: &quot;The dignity of man is inviolable. To respect and protect it is the duty of all state authority.&quot; Art. 2 Para. (1);
* Rule of law: &quot;Every Greek is equal before the law.&quot; Art. 4 Para. (1);
* Public functions: &quot;Only Greek citizens shall be eligible for public service, except as otherwise provided by special laws.&quot; Art. 4 Para (4);
* Titles of nobility: &quot;Titles of nobility or distinction are neither conferred upon nor recognized in Greek citizens.&quot; Art. 4 Para (7);
* Acknowledgement of free personality: &quot;All people shall have the right to develop freely their personality and to participate in the social, economic and political life of the country, insofar as they do not infringe the rights of others or violate the Constitution and the good usages.&quot; Art. 5 Para (1);
* Personal liberty: &quot;Personal liberty is inviolable. No one shall be prosecuted, arrested, imprisoned or otherwise confined except when and as the law provides.&quot; Art. 5 Para. (3);
* Freedom of religion: &quot;Freedom of religious conscience is inviolable. The enjoyment of civil rights and liberties does not depend on the individual&#x27;s religious beliefs.&quot; Art. 13 Para. (1)
* Separation of powers: &quot;Specific legislative, executive and judicial organs&quot;, Art. 26.

===Ireland===
The Constitution of the Irish Free State was required in parts to be consistent with the 1922 Anglo-Irish Treaty, including the Oath of Allegiance and the Governor-General. The checks to protect this were removed by, for example, the Irish taking control of advice to the Governor-General, and when the Senate proved obstructive, its abolition.

In debate surround 2018 relaxation of abortion laws there were proposals to entrench certain aspects of the legislation, which was deemed unconstitutional. An attempt to overturn the 34th Amendment to the constitution on the basis that amendments were impermissible if they contradicted other provisions of the constitution was rejected by the Court of Appeal.

===Italy===
Article 139 of the Constitution of Italy, which came into effect in 1948, provides that the republican form of government shall not be a matter for constitutional amendment.

=== Portugal ===
In the Constitution of Portugal, an eternity clause exists in the form of article 288. Titled &quot;Material limits on revision&quot;, it provides that the following can never be removed through amendment:

* National independence and the unity of the state;
* The republican form of government;
* The separation between church and state;
* Citizens’ rights, freedoms and guarantees;
* The rights of workers, workers’ committees and trade unions;
* The coexistence of the public, private and cooperative and social sectors of ownership of the means of production;
* The existence of economic plans, within the framework of a mixed economy;
* The appointment of the elected officeholders of the entities that exercise sovereignty, of the organs of the autonomous regions and of local government organs by universal, direct, secret and periodic suffrage; and the proportional representation system;
* Plural expression and political organisation, including political parties, and the right of democratic opposition;
* The separation and interdependence of the entities that exercise sovereignty;
* The subjection of legal norms to review of their positive constitutionality and of their unconstitutionality by omission;
* The independence of the courts;
* The autonomy of local authorities;
* The political and administrative autonomy of the Azores and Madeira archipelagos.

===Spain===
Most of the body of the Constitution of Spain can be modified by a three-fifths majority of both chambers of the Cortes Generales, or an absolute majority of the Senate and a two-thirds majority of the Congress of Deputies if the first method of approval fails.

However, modifications of the Preliminary Title (sovereignty and constitutional principles), the First Section of the First Title (fundamental rights and liberties of the Spaniards), or the Second Title (the Monarchy), as well as drafting a full new Constitution replacing the current, would require a two-thirds majority of both chambers, an immediate new general election, a two-thirds majority of the newly elected chambers, and a final referendum.

Constitutional amendments cannot be introduced during wartime or a state of emergency.

===United Kingdom===
The doctrine of parliamentary supremacy holds that Parliament may pass any law it wishes, with the exception that it cannot bind its successors (or be limited by its predecessors). Moreover, the UK&#x27;s constitution is uncodified, being contained instead in informal conventions, standing orders of the two Houses of Parliament, and ordinary legislation (in particular Acts of Parliament). Therefore, the constitution is unentrenched as previous legislation can be amended by the passing of statute, requiring a simple majority vote in the House of Commons.

Notions of entrenchment have emerged in consideration of a number of constitutional statutes, including the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949. (See &quot;R (Jackson) v Attorney General&quot; [2005] UKHL 56.)

Andrew Blick, Senior Lecturer in Politics at King&#x27;s College London, argues that the use of a supermajority requirement for the House of Commons in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 represents a move towards entrenched clauses in the UK Constitution. Nevertheless, after failing to secure the required supermajority for an election in 2019, the government passed the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019, which only required a simple majority, to override the act and call an early general election. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 was subsequently repealed and replaced by the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, which deleted the supermajority requirement altogether and reinstated the government&#x27;s power to call an election at will.

==Company law==
Provisions may also be entrenched in the constitutions of corporate bodies. An example is in the memoranda and articles of a company limited by guarantee, in which the principles of common ownership may be entrenched. This practice can make it almost impossible for the company&#x27;s members to dissolve the company and distribute its assets amongst them. This idea has more recently been extended in the UK through the invention of the community interest company (CIC), which incorporates an asset lock. Other companies in the UK may make provision for entrenchment of certain articles so that, for example, the specified articles may only be amended or repealed by agreement of all the members of the company or by a court order. In India there is similar provision in section 5 of the Companies Act 2013.

<text>Chamique Shaunta Holdsclaw (born August 9, 1977) is an American former professional basketball player in the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA). She announced her retirement from the Los Angeles Sparks on June 11, 2007, though she eventually came out of retirement to play with the Atlanta Dream for the 2009 WNBA Season. Holdsclaw was inducted into the NYC Basketball Hall of Fame in 2015, and the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame in 2018.

==Early life==
Holdsclaw grew up playing basketball. While attending Christ the King Regional High School in Queens, New York, she played for the school&#x27;s women&#x27;s basketball team, and led them to four straight New York State Championships in basketball. Holdsclaw was named a High School All-American by the Women&#x27;s Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA). She participated in the WBCA High School All-America Game in 1995, scoring eight points.

==College career==
Holdsclaw went to the University of Tennessee from 1995 to 1999, where she played under coach Pat Summitt and helped to lead the Lady Vols to the women&#x27;s NCAA&#x27;s first ever three consecutive Women&#x27;s Basketball Championships in 1996, 1997 and 1998. The 1998 championship was Tennessee&#x27;s first ever undefeated season at 39–0 and also set an NCAA record for the most wins ever in a season. She also helped lead Tennessee to two SEC regular season titles in 1998 and 1999 and to three SEC tournament championships in 1996, 1998 and 1999.

At Tennessee, Holdsclaw was a four-time Kodak All-America, one of only six women&#x27;s basketball players to earn the honor (along with teammate Tamika Catchings, Cheryl Miller of USC, Ann Meyers of UCLA, Lynette Woodard of Kansas and LaToya Thomas of Mississippi State.) Holdsclaw finished her career with 3,025 points and 1,295 rebounds, making her the all-time leading scoring and rebounder at Tennessee in men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s history, the all-time leading scorer and rebounder in SEC women&#x27;s history, and the all-time leading scorer and rebounder in the NCAA tournament women&#x27;s history with 470 points and 197 rebounds. She was also only the fifth women&#x27;s basketball player in NCAA history to have 3,000 points (a list including Jackie Stiles of Southwest Missouri State, Patricia Hoskins of Mississippi Valley State, Lorri Bauman of Drake, Cheryl Miller of USC, and Cindy Blodgett of Maine). She is also one of five women&#x27;s collegiate basketball players to ever accumulate over 2,000 points, 1,000 rebounds, 300 assists and 300 steals (a list that includes teammate Tamika Catchings, Cheryl Miller of USC, Sophia Young of Baylor, and Armintie Price of Mississippi.) In 1998, Holdsclaw received the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States. Holdsclaw also won the Naismith trophy for player of the year twice, in 1998 and 1999, and posted a 131–17 win–loss record during her remarkable career as a Lady Vol. In 2000, she was named Naismith&#x27;s Player of the Century for the 1990s and was also part of an ESPY award given to the Lady Vols as Co-Team of the Decade for the 1990s. In 1996, 1997, and 1998, Holdsclaw was named to the Final Four All Tournament team.

In 2006, Holdsclaw was named to a women&#x27;s collegiate basketball silver anniversary team for being picked as one of the 25 greatest players of the past 25 years. She was also picked as one of the 5 greatest players in the SEC of the past 25 years.

Holdsclaw is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.

==WNBA career==

In the 1999 WNBA draft, Holdsclaw was selected by the Washington Mystics 1st overall. After this selection, Holdsclaw gained the distinction of being the first female athlete to appear on the cover of &quot;SLAM&quot; magazine. Furthermore, Holdsclaw was pictured in a New York Knicks jersey, implying that perhaps she was good enough to play in the NBA.

In her first season, she was named the Rookie of the Year, the first number one draft pick to win that honor. She was also a starter in the inaugural WNBA All-Star Game that same year. She averaged 16.9 points and 7.9 rebounds per game in her first season. The next year, Holdsclaw was named to the Olympic team, helping to lead them to a gold medal.

During her subsequent seasons in the WNBA, Holdsclaw continued to improve her numbers. In 2002, despite missing several games with an ankle injury, Holdsclaw averaged a double-double per game with 19.9 points and 11.5 rebounds. By 2003, she was averaging 20.5 points and 10.9 rebounds per game. On July 24, 2004, however, she failed to show up for a game against Charlotte, played one more game in reserve and then did not play the rest of the season including the entire playoffs.

On March 21, 2005, Holdsclaw was traded to the Los Angeles Sparks in exchange for DeLisha Milton-Jones.

In May 2006, Holdsclaw took a sudden two-week leave from playing for the Sparks, but later clarified that this was due to the serious illnesses of her father and stepfather. As of late June, she was averaging 14.4 points per game and 7 rebounds per game.

On June 11, 2007, only a few weeks into the 2007 WNBA season, she surprisingly announced she was retiring and did not immediately provide any explanation as to her sudden departure.

On December 17, 2008, the Atlanta Dream traded the 13th pick in the 2009 WNBA draft to the Los Angeles Sparks in exchange for the rights to Holdsclaw. Holdsclaw stated she definitely considered a return to the WNBA if healthy, and did. Holdsclaw was a constant part of the team&#x27;s offense and a starter that season, despite an injury that kept her out several games toward the end of the season. However, she returned just in time for one game in the playoffs. The Dream lost to the Detroit Shock.

On May 19, 2010, she was released from the Dream after requesting a trade and did not report to the team. Two days later, she signed with the San Antonio Silver Stars.

==Chamique Holdsclaw Foundation==
Today, Holdsclaw works as a mental health advocate.

==Personal life==
Holdsclaw wrote in her autobiography &quot;Breaking Through: Beating the Odds Shot after Shot&quot; (2012, ) that she had suffered depression during her professional basketball career, and attempted suicide on one occasion.

Atlanta police issued an arrest warrant for Holdsclaw on November 15, 2012, after Holdsclaw allegedly attacked her ex-girlfriend&#x27;s car with a baseball bat and shot at the car. The owner of the car, fellow WNBA player Jennifer Lacy, was uninjured. It was announced on February 27, 2013, that Holdsclaw was being indicted for the November shooting in Atlanta. It is a six-count indictment charging her with aggravated assault, criminal damage and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. Holdsclaw was released from jail after posting a $100,000 bond and a court date was not set.

Holdsclaw pleaded guilty June 14, 2013, to aggravated assault, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and other charges. She was sentenced to three years&#x27; probation and ordered to perform 120 hours of community service and pay a $3,000 fine under the plea agreement. Holdsclaw&#x27;s attorney Ed Garland said his client &quot;felt that to honestly accept what her actions were was best for everyone concerned&quot;.

Documentary filmmaker Rick Goldsmith produced a film on Holdsclaw&#x27;s life and battle with mental illness called &quot;Mind/Game: The Unquiet Journey of Chamique Holdsclaw&quot; which aired on Logo TV on May 3, 2016.

<doc id="756299" wikidata="Q1237312" url="?curid=756299" title="Domenico di Michelino">
<text>Domenico di Michelino (1417–1491) was an Italian Renaissance painter who was born and died in Florence. His birth name was Domenico di Francesco. The patronymic &quot;di Michelino&quot; was adopted in honour of his teacher, the cassone painter Michelino di Benedetto (c. 1378-1499), by whom no works have been identified. Giorgio Vasari reports that Domenico was also a pupil of Fra Angelico, whose influence is reflected in many of Domenico&#x27;s paintings along with that of Filippo Lippi and Pesellino.

Domenico enrolled in the Florentine painters&#x27; confraternity, the Compagnia di San Luca, by 1442. Two years later he joined the Arte dei Medici e Speziali, the Florentine painters&#x27; guild. He had a workshop in the Via delle Terme, Florence, which he shared with Domenico di Zanobi (formerly known as the Master of the Johnson Nativity).

His earliest extant work is a processional banner for the Ospedale degli Innocenti, Florence, in which the Virgin is shown protecting the martyred innocents beneath her mantle. Commissioned in 1440 and completed in 1446, the picture was entirely repainted in the sixteenth century by Michele Tosini.

In 1449-50 Domenico painted the chapel of Saint Leonard in the church of Santa Maria a Peretola on the outskirts of Florence. The chapel includes a lunette with a scene of &quot;Saint Leonard Freeing Prisoners&quot; as well as images of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, Saint Lucy and musical angels.

In 1458 Domenico painted an altarpiece of the &quot;Madonna and Child with Saints&quot;, now at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, and in 1463 he was commissioned an altarpiece by Cosimo de&#x27; Medici for the church of San Girolamo in Volterra (now at the local Museo Diocesano). Other, undated altarpieces are in Anghiari (Santo Stefano), Dijon (Musée des Beaux-Arts), Florence (Galleria dell&#x27;Accademia), San Gimignano (Museo Civico) and San Giovanni Valdarno (Museo della Basilica di Santa Maria delle Grazie). A painting of &quot;Saint Lawrence&quot; at San Lorenzo a Porciano in Stia, painted between 1477 and 1482, is representative of Domenico&#x27;s late work. In addition to altarpieces, he also made many small-scale paintings of religious subjects, painted the fronts of &quot;cassoni&quot;, and illuminated manuscripts.

Domenico&#x27;s most famous work is the &quot;Comedy Illuminating Florence&quot; on the north wall of the cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, Florence. According to documents, the painting was commissioned on 30 January 1465 and was designed by Alesso Baldovinetti. It shows Dante Alighieri presenting his famous poem, the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, to the city of Florence. Views of Hell, Mount Purgatory and Paradise appear in the background, all as described in the poem. It has been suggested that the painting was inspired by Giovanni di Paolo&#x27;s illumination for &quot;Paradiso&quot; 17 in the celebrated &quot;Yates Thompson Manuscript&quot; (c. 1444-1450; London, British Library, Yates Thompson MS 36), one of the finest &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; manuscripts ever produced, which shows all of the same details but in reverse.

Domenico was still active in 1483 but few of his works from this period survive. He died in Florence on 18 April 1491 and was buried in the church of Sant&#x27;Ambrogio.

The art historian Bernard Berenson mistakenly assigned all of Domenico&#x27;s paintings to Giusto d&#x27;Andrea (1440-1496), and misattributed Zanobi Strozzi&#x27;s paintings to Domenico di Michelino.

<doc id="756319" wikidata="Q742829" url="?curid=756319" title="Folsom Prison Blues">
<text>&quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; is a song by American singer-songwriter Johnny Cash, based on material composed by Gordon Jenkins. Written in 1953, it was first recorded and released as a single in 1955, and later included on his debut studio album &quot;Johnny Cash with His Hot and Blue Guitar!&quot; (1957), as the album&#x27;s eleventh track. The song combines elements from two popular folk styles, the train song and the prison song, both of which Cash continued to use for the rest of his career. It was one of Cash&#x27;s signature songs. Additionally, this recording was included on the compilation album &quot;All Aboard the Blue Train&quot; (1962). In June 2014, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it No. 51 on its list of the 100 greatest country songs of all time.

Cash performed the song live to a crowd of inmates at Folsom State Prison in 1968 for his live album &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot; (1968), released through Columbia Records. This version became a No. 1 hit on the country music charts and reached No. 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the same year. This version also won the Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male, at the 11th Annual Grammy Awards in 1969.

==Original 1955 recording==
Cash was inspired to write this song after seeing the movie &quot;Inside the Walls of Folsom Prison&quot; (1951) while serving in West Germany in the United States Air Force at Landsberg, Bavaria (itself the location of a famous prison). Cash recounted how he came up with the line &quot;But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die&quot;: &quot;I sat with my pen in my hand, trying to think up the worst reason a person could have for killing another person, and that&#x27;s what came to mind.&quot;

Cash took the melody for the song and many of the lyrics from Gordon Jenkins&#x27;s 1953 &quot;Seven Dreams&quot; concept album, specifically the song &quot;Crescent City Blues&quot;. Jenkins was not credited on the original record, which was issued by Sun Records. In the early 1970s, after the song became popular, Cash paid Jenkins a settlement of approximately US$75,000 following a lawsuit.

&quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; was recorded at the Sun Studio in Memphis, Tennessee, on July 30, 1955. The producer was Sam Phillips, and the musicians were Cash (vocals, guitar), Luther Perkins (guitar), and Marshall Grant (bass). Like other songs recorded during his early Sun Records sessions, Cash had no drummer in the studio, but replicated the snare drum sound by inserting a piece of paper (like a dollar bill) under the guitar strings and strumming the snare rhythm on his guitar. The song&#x27;s sound has been described as country, rockabilly, and rock and roll. The song was released as a single with another song recorded at the same session, &quot;So Doggone Lonesome&quot;. Early in 1956, both sides reached No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; C&amp;W Best Sellers chart.

When photographer Jim Marshall asked Cash why the song&#x27;s main character was serving time in California&#x27;s Folsom Prison after shooting a man in Reno, Nevada, he responded, &quot;That&#x27;s called poetic license.&quot;

In 2001, the 1955 original version of &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; on Sun Records by Johnny Cash was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. They list the song date as 1956.

==Live 1968 recording==
Cash opened almost all of his concerts with &quot;Folsom Prison Blues,&quot; after greeting the audience with his trademark introduction, &quot;Hello, I&#x27;m Johnny Cash,&quot; for decades. Cash performed the song at Folsom Prison itself on January 13, 1968, which was recorded and later released as a live album titled &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot;. That opening version of the song is more up-tempo than the original Sun recording. According to Michael Streissguth, the cheering from the audience following the line &quot;But I shot a man in Reno / just to watch him die&quot; was added in post-production. According to a special feature on the DVD release of the 2005 biopic &quot;Walk the Line&quot;, the prisoners avoided cheering at any of Cash&#x27;s comments about the prison itself, fearing reprisal from guards. The performance again featured Cash, Perkins and Grant, as on the original recording, together with W.S. Holland (drums).

Released as a single, the live version reached number 1 on the country singles chart, and number 32 on the Hot 100, in 1968. Pitchfork Media placed this live version at number 8 on its list of &quot;The 200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s.&quot; The live performance of the song won Cash the Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male, the first of four he won in his career, at the 1969 Grammy Awards.

<doc id="756324" wikidata="Q631104" url="?curid=756324" title="Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel">
<text>The Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel () () is a triumphal arch in Paris, located in the Place du Carrousel. It is an example of Neoclassical architecture in the Corinthian order. It was built between 1806 and 1808 to commemorate Napoleon&#x27;s military victories in the Wars of the Third and Fourth Coalitions. The Arc de Triomphe de l&#x27;Étoile, at the far end of the Champs-Élysées, is about twice the size; designed in the same year but not completed until 1836.

==Description==


The monument is high, wide, and deep. The high central arch is flanked by two smaller ones, high, and wide. Around its exterior are eight Corinthian columns of marble. These columns were recovered from the Château de Meudon, destroyed in 1804. Each column is topped by eight soldiers of the Empire. On the pediment, between the soldiers, bas-reliefs depict:

* the Arms of the Kingdom of Italy with figures representing History and the Arts
* the Arms of the French Empire with Victory, Fame, History, and Abundance
* Wisdom and Strength holding the arms of the Kingdom of Italy, accompanied by Prudence and Victory.

Napoleon&#x27;s diplomatic and military victories are commemorated by bas-reliefs executed in rose marble. They depict:

* the Peace of Pressburg
* Napoleon entering Munich
* Napoleon entering Vienna, sculptor Louis-Pierre Deseine
* the Battle of Austerlitz, sculptor Jean-Joseph Espercieux
* the Tilsit Conference
* the surrender of Ulm, sculptor Pierre Cartellier

The arch is derivative of the triumphal arches of the Roman Empire, in particular the Arch of Septimius Severus in Rome. The subjects of the bas-reliefs devoted to the battles were selected by the director of the Musée Napoléon (located at the time in the Louvre), Vivant Denon, and designed by Charles Meynier.

On the top of each of the eight marble columns are marble sculptures that faithfully reproduce the uniforms of the principal corps of Napoleon’s imperial army. On the east side (towards the Louvre), the four statues are a cuirassier by Auguste Taunay, a dragoon by Charles-Louis Corbet, a mounted chasseur by Jean-Joseph Foucou and a caribinier by Joseph Chinard. On the west side (towards the Tuileries Gardens), the statues represent a grenadier by Robert-Guillaume Dardel, a line carabinier by Antoine Mouton, a cannonier by Charles-Antoine Bridan and a sapper by Auguste Dumont. The statue of the sapper is the only one that represents a real soldier, :fr: Dominique Gaye Mariolle, who was known for his strength and height, which exceeded 2 meters. He is famous for having presented a cannon instead of a rifle during Napoleon’s review of his troops prior to the battle of Tilsitt in July 1807.

The quadriga atop the entablement is a copy of the so-called Horses of Saint Mark that adorn the top of the main door of the St Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice.

==History==
Designed by Charles Percier and Pierre François Léonard Fontaine, the arch was built between 1806 and 1808 by the Emperor Napoleon I, on the model of the Arch of Constantine (312 AD) in Rome, as a gateway of the Tuileries Palace, the Imperial residence. The destruction of the Tuileries Palace during the Paris Commune in 1871, allowed an unobstructed view west towards the Arc de Triomphe.

It was originally surmounted by the Horses of Saint Mark from St Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice, which had been captured in 1798 by Napoleon. In 1815, following the Battle of Waterloo and the Bourbon restoration, France ceded the quadriga to the Austrian Empire which had annexed Venice under the terms of the Congress of Vienna. The Austrians immediately returned the statuary to Venice. The horses of Saint Mark were replaced in 1828 by a quadriga sculpted by Baron François Joseph Bosio, depicting Peace riding in a triumphal chariot led by gilded Victories on both sides. The composition commemorates the Restoration of the Bourbons following Napoleon&#x27;s downfall.

The Arc du Carrousel inspired the design of Marble Arch, constructed in London between 1826 and 1833.

===Geography===
The Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel is at the eastern end of Paris Axe historique (&quot;historic axis&quot;), a nine-kilometre-long linear route which dominates much of the northwestern quadrant of the city.

Looking west, the arch is aligned with the obelisk in the Place de la Concorde, the centerline of the grand boulevard Champs-Élysées, the Arc de Triomphe at the Place de l&#x27;Étoile, and, although it is not directly visible from the Place du Carrousel, the Grande Arche de la Défense. Thus, the axis begins and ends with an arch. When the Arc du Carrousel was built, however, an observer in the Place du Carrousel was impeded from any view westward. The central part of the Palais des Tuileries intervened to block the line of sight to the west. When the Tuileries was burned down during the Paris Commune in 1871, and its ruins were swept away, the great axis, as it presently exists, was opened all the way to the Place du Carrousel and the Louvre.
