<text>Jack Eugene Jensen (March 9, 1927 – July 14, 1982) was an American right fielder in Major League Baseball who played for three American League (AL) teams from 1950 to 1961, most notably the Boston Red Sox. He was named the AL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player (MVP) in after hitting 35 home runs and leading the league with 122 runs batted in (RBIs); he also led the league in RBIs two other years, and in triples and stolen bases once each. Respected for his throwing arm, he won a Gold Glove Award and led the AL in assists and double plays twice each. He retired in his early thirties as major-league baseball expanded westward, due to an intense fear of flying. After being a two-sport star in college, Jensen was the first person to play in the Rose Bowl, the World Series, and the MLB All-Star Game.

==Early years==
Jensen was born in San Francisco, California. His parents divorced when he was five, and he was raised by his mother, who frequently moved the family. After serving in the Navy toward the end of World War II, he became an All-American in two sports at the University of California. As a baseball pitcher and outfielder, he helped California to win the inaugural College World Series in . He pitched Cal to victory in the regional final by outdueling Bobby Layne of Texas, and in the championship Cal defeated a Yale team featuring future President George Bush. As a football halfback, Jensen was a consensus All-American as a junior in 1948, becoming the first Cal player to rush for 1,000 yards. In the season-ending 7–6 victory over Stanford he ran for 170 yards, kicked a punt for 67 yards, and had a 32-yard run late in the game in a 4th-and-31 situation. Cal ended the regular season at 10–0 under coach Pappy Waldorf, winning a share of its first Pacific Coast Conference title in ten years, and Jensen placed fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting, with Doak Walker taking the award. In the 1949 Rose Bowl, Jensen scored a touchdown in the first quarter to tie the game 7–7, but fourth-ranked Cal was upset 20–14 by seventh-ranked Northwestern.

==Baseball career==
In 1949, Jensen, who batted and threw right-handed, left college after his junior year and signed with the Oakland Oaks in the Pacific Coast League. His contract – along with Billy Martin&#x27;s – was sold to the New York Yankees in with the intention of him being a backup for future Hall of Fame centerfielder Joe DiMaggio. But he played in only 108 games for the Yankees over three years, primarily in left field. He appeared as a pinch runner for Bobby Brown in the eighth inning of Game 3 of the 1950 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies, but was in the game only briefly before Johnny Mize popped up to end the inning. Jensen did not stay in the game defensively, and the Yankees completed a sweep of the Phillies in Game 4. Mickey Mantle appeared in 1951 as DiMaggio&#x27;s heir-apparent, preempting Jensen and starting in right field. Jensen did not appear in the 1951 Series against the New York Giants.

In May 1952 Jensen was sent to the Washington Senators in a six-player deal, and he made his first All-Star team. He finished the season with a .286 batting average and 80 RBIs, leading the league with 17 assists and placing third in the AL with 18 steals, a total he duplicated in 1953. He was traded to the Red Sox in December 1953, and led the AL with 22 steals in , also finishing third in RBIs (117) and fourth in home runs (25). But despite his speed he also set a major league record by grounding into double plays 32 times, breaking fellow Red Sox Bobby Doerr&#x27;s total of 31; the record would stand until Red Sock Jim Rice grounded into 36 double plays in . No longer facing the pressure of becoming his team&#x27;s principal star, Jensen again made the All-Star team in , leading the league with 116 RBIs and finishing tenth in the MVP vote.

In Jensen batted a career-high .315 and led the AL with 11 triples, and in he had 103 RBIs and led the league in both assists (16) and double plays (4). The 31 year-old star had his best season in , earning the AL MVP and beating out Bob Turley, Rocky Colavito and Bob Cerv with a .286 batting average, a league-leading 122 RBIs, also placing second in the AL with 99 walks and fifth in home runs (35), doubles (31), total bases (293) and on-base percentage (.396). In June of that same year, he set a Red Sox club record for most home runs in a single month (since tied by David Ortiz) with 14, and in July made his final All-Star team. In he again led the league in RBIs (112) and won his only Gold Glove after leading the AL in double plays (4) for the second time; he also scored a career-best 101 runs and stole 20 bases, finishing third in the AL in steals for the fourth time among his seven Top 10 finishes. He came in tenth in the MVP balloting.

===Retirement===
Smack in his productive prime at 32, Jensen announced his retirement from baseball in January 1960, primarily because of an intense fear of flying, but also the result of the long separations from his family. He stated, &quot;I have only one life to live, and I&#x27;ll be happier when I can spend it with my family. Being away from home with a baseball team for seven months a year doesn&#x27;t represent the kind of life I want or the kind of life my wife and children want.&quot; Indeed, upon his trade to the Red Sox in 1953 he considered not reporting to the team in order to return to his family in California, but general manager Joe Cronin increased his salary by $1,000 and he agreed to play. As teams had increasingly turned to air travel in the 1950s, he had unsuccessfully sought to combat his aversion to flying, aided considerably by Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey, who arranged for therapy treatments. Once major-league baseball expanded to the West Coast in 1958, and with further expansion and constant air travel foreseen, Jensen&#x27;s difficulties became virtually insurmountable.

Jensen made a comeback attempt with Boston in , but turned to hypnotherapy when his panic attacks at airports became unbearable. Frustrated by a sub-par season (.263, 66 RBIs), he retired again for good. In an 11-season career, Jensen was a .279 hitter with 199 home runs and 929 RBIs in 1,438 games. He also scored 810 runs, had 1,463 hits, 259 doubles, 45 triples, 143 stolen bases, and 750 walks, for a .369 on-base percentage and .460 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .977 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions.

==Television appearances==
On April 17, 1956, Jensen appeared as himself, with Vivi Janiss as his mother, in &quot;The Jackie Jensen Story,&quot; which aired on the NBC anthology television series &quot;Cavalcade of America&quot;. Child actor Gary Gray played Jensen as a sixteen-year-old.

Jensen appeared in four episodes of &quot;Home Run Derby&quot;, which aired in 1960. He was 2–2 in his appearances, defeating Ernie Banks and Rocky Colavito, while losing twice to Mickey Mantle.

==Later life==
Following his retirement, Jensen became sports director at radio station KTVN in Reno, Nevada, worked as a college football broadcaster for ABC television, and coached baseball at the University of Nevada and at the University of California, Berkeley. He also managed the minor league Jamestown Falcons in 1970. He was co-owner of the Bow &amp; Bell restaurant with Charles &quot;Boots&quot; Erb in Jack London Square in Oakland, California.

On October 16, 1949, Jensen married Zoe Ann Olsen, the silver medalist in diving at the 1948 Summer Olympics; the couple divorced on May 18, 1963, remarried on July 11, 1964, and divorced again on January 17, 1968. In February 1968, he married Katherine Cortezi. Jensen had three children by his first wife – Jon, Jan, and Jay. Jay&#x27;s son Tucker Jensen pitched in two NCAA Division II baseball tournaments for Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University, pitched in the Toronto Blue Jays organization during 2011–2012, and pitched for the Gateway Grizzlies of the independent Frontier League during 2013–2014.

Jensen died on the way to University of Virginia Hospital in Charlottesville, Virginia, at the age of 55 after suffering an apparent heart attack at his home near Scottsville, Virginia. He is interred in Amherst, Virginia.

==Legacy==

Jensen was one of several Red Sox players featured in the 1957 Norman Rockwell painting &quot;The Rookie&quot;.

Jensen was inducted into the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame in 1983, the College Football Hall of Fame in 1984, and the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2000. Also in 2000, &quot;The Golden Boy: A Biography of Jackie Jensen&quot; was published, with a foreword by Curt Gowdy.

<text>Herbalife Nutrition Ltd., also called Herbalife International, Inc. (with a U.S. subsidiary called Herbalife International of America) or simply Herbalife, is an American multinational multi-level marketing (MLM) corporation that develops and sells dietary supplements. The company has been alleged to have fraudulently operated a pyramid scheme; under an SEC agreement the compensation and other benefits have been restructured over the past years to include sales metrics linked to bonuses. Some products sold by Herbalife have caused acute hepatitis. The business is incorporated in the Cayman Islands, a tax haven, with its corporate headquarters located in Los Angeles, California.

The company was founded by Mark R. Hughes in 1980, and it employs an estimated 9,900 people worldwide. The company operates in 95 countries through a network of approximately 4.5 million independent distributors and members. In October 2022, previous CEO Michael O. Johnson was appointed as Chairman and interim Chief Executive Officer following the departure of John Agwunobi.

Herbalife has been accused of deceiving distributors about the amount of income they could expect to earn and that most of their income would be made from recruiting additional distributors instead of from selling merchandise. The company agreed to &quot;fundamentally restructure&quot; its business in the United States and pay a $200 million fine as part of a 2016 settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) following these accusations.

==History==
In February 1980, Mark R. Hughes began selling the original Herbalife weight management product from the trunk of his car. Hughes often stated that the genesis of his product and program stemmed from the weight loss concerns of his mother Joanne whose premature death he attributed to an eating disorder and an unhealthy approach to weight loss. His first product was a protein shake designed to help people manage their weight. He structured his company using a direct-selling, multi-level marketing model. 

In 1982, Herbalife received complaints from the Food and Drug Administration for claims made about certain products and the inclusion of mandrake, poke root, and food-grade linseed oil in another.

The Department of Justice of Canada filed criminal charges against the company in November 1984 for misleading medical claims in advertisements. As a result of the complaints, the company modified its product claims and reformulated the product.

By 1985, Herbalife was considered the fastest-growing private company in America by &quot;Inc.&quot; after its sales increased from $386 thousand to $423 million over the previous five years. That same year, the California Attorney General sued the company for making inflated claims about the efficacy of its products. The company suffered as a result of the lawsuit and was forced to lay off nearly 800 employees by May 1985. The company settled the suit for $850,000 without admitting wrongdoing. 

In 1986, Herbalife became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ and rebranded itself as Herbalife International. However, as a result of the negative publicity from the FDA lawsuit, the company posted a $3 million loss that year.

By 1988, the company had expanded its reach to Japan, Spain, New Zealand, Israel, and Mexico, and it increased its worldwide sales to $191 million in 1991. 

In 1993, the company underwent a secondary offering of five million shares. 

The company launched a line of personal care products in 1995 which included fragrances and facial cleansing products. 

The company was sued in civil court by two former distributors in 1997 for withholding earned income.

In 1999, Hughes attempted to take the company private after asserting that Wall Street was undervaluing the company. While the board approved the buyout offer, shareholders of the company filed a suit against the company because they believed the share price they were offered was unfair. Hughes eventually abandoned his attempt to buy the company and settled the suit with shareholders. On May 20, 2000, Mark Hughes died at age 44. Following his death, the company was led by Christopher Pair until October 2001.

=== J.H. Whitney &amp; Company and Golden Gate Capital ===
In 2002, the company was acquired for US$685 million by J.H. Whitney &amp; Company and Golden Gate Capital. Concurrently, plant sources of ephedrine were removed from Herbalife products in 2002 after several U.S. states banned supplements containing such herbs. 

In April 2003, Michael O. Johnson joined Herbalife as CEO following a 17-year career with The Walt Disney Company. 

On December 16, 2004, the company had an initial public offering on the NYSE of 14.5 million common shares at $14 per share, netting the owners $1.3 billion.

On May 7, 2014, the company announced that it entered into a deal with Bank of America Merrill Lynch to repurchase $266 million of its stock.

The company announced in November 2016 that Chief Operating Officer Richard Goudis would take over the position of CEO in June 2017 and Johnson would transition to executive chairman. 

In August 2017, the company announced that it would repurchase up to $600 million of its stock. 

On April 25, 2018, Herbalife announced that it had changed its name from Herbalife Ltd. to Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. The company also announced that its shareholders had approved a two-for-one stock split. 

In January 2019, Herbalife announced that it was replacing Goudis after learning of comments he had made before taking over as CEO that were “contrary to the company’s expense-related policies and business practices” and inconsistent with the company&#x27;s standards and culture”. Former CEO Johnson subsequently took over the role on an interim basis.

In March 2020, John Agwunobi was named as its next chief executive. Agwunobi departed Herbalife Nutrition in October 2022 and Michael O. Johnson was named Chairman and interim Chief Executive Officer.

==Products==

Herbalife Nutrition&#x27;s products include weight-loss and protein shakes, as well as protein bars, teas, aloes, vitamins, and sports hydration, energy, and personal care products. The company&#x27;s original product is the Formula 1 protein shake, a soy-based meal-replacement shake. The product debuted in 1980 and, as of 2015, was the company&#x27;s best selling product accounting for nearly 30% of total sales.

Herbalife&#x27;s products are produced at the company&#x27;s five manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and China, as well as by third-party manufacturing partners. The company&#x27;s production process is based on a &quot;seed to feed&quot; strategy, which the company initiated in the 2010s that allows it to trace where the ingredients in its nutritional products originated. Since 2013, the company has operated a botanical extraction facility in Changsha, Hunan Province, China. The facility produces botanical extracts, including teas, guarana, chamomile, broccoli, and bilberry, for use in many of the company&#x27;s products. Before extracts are processed, they undergo a botanical identification program and are tested several times throughout the production process. The processed raw materials from the extraction facility are used at all of the company&#x27;s branded manufacturing facilities as well as by its partners. As of 2015, 58% of the company&#x27;s nutrition products were manufactured at Herbalife-owned facilities.

In China, the company&#x27;s manufacturing sites are located in Suzhou and Nanjing. In the U.S., the company has manufacturing facilities in Lake Forest, California, and Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

Herbalife&#x27;s claims of health benefits from its products have met scrutiny from the medical community, consumers, and government agencies.

In 2008, Herbalife was sued after laboratory tests indicated that levels of lead in several Herbalife products were in excess of California state law and could lead to liver problems over an extended period of time. The company commissioned its own lab testing and found that those products did not contain high enough amounts of lead to require special labeling.

==Business model==
Herbalife Nutrition is a multi-level marketing company. A 2010 article in the &quot;Los Angeles Business Journal&quot; claimed that Herbalife Nutrition was one of the most profitable companies in Los Angeles County and directly benefited from its business model.

As a result of the 2016 FTC settlement, the company is required to prove that at least 80 percent of its sales are made to individuals outside of its distributor network. Distributors are responsible for providing receipts for sales and proving they have legitimate customers. The settlement also required that distributors are only able to earn one-third of their rewards based on recruitment. In the U.S., the company now differentiates between individuals who join as a member to buy discounted products and those who join as a distributor seeking a business opportunity. Discount buyers are unable to earn rewards or sell products. Herbalife Nutrition is also required to have its practices monitored by an outside party for seven years to ensure compliance.

In the past, company management considered the number and retention of distributors a key parameter and tracked it closely in financial reports. By January of each year, sales leaders are required to requalify. In February of each year, individuals who did not satisfy the sales leader qualification requirements during the preceding 12 months are removed from that rank. For the latest 12-month requalification period ending January 2019, approximately 67.9 percent of the eligible sales leaders requalified.

In a California class action suit (&quot;Minton v. Herbalife International, et al.&quot;) filed on February 17, 2005, the plaintiff challenged &quot;the marketing practices of certain Herbalife International independent distributors under various state laws&quot;. In a West Virginia class action suit (&quot;Mey v. Herbalife International, Inc., et al.&quot;) filed on July 16, 2003, the plaintiffs alleged that some of Herbalife International&#x27;s distributors used pre-recorded telephone messages and autodialers to contact prospective customers in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. The case was resolved with Herbalife and its distributors paying $7 million into a fund for class members part of the suit.

==Liver disease inquiries==
Hospitals in Israel, Spain, Switzerland, Iceland, Argentina, and the United States have reported liver damage in a number of patients who used Herbalife products.

In 2004, Israel&#x27;s Health Minister began an investigation into Herbalife&#x27;s products after four persons using Herbalife&#x27;s products were found to have liver problems. The company was accused of selling products containing toxic ingredients such as quaqua, comfrey, and kraska. The products were sent to Bio-Medical Research Design LTD (B.R.D), to a private U.S. laboratory, and to Israel&#x27;s Forensic research laboratory. A study of the cases funded by the Israeli Ministry of Health concluded that there was a causative relationship. Herbalife&#x27;s SEC 10-Q filings stated that the Israeli Ministry of Health did not establish a causal relationship between the product and liver ailments. In 2009, an Israeli woman sued Herbalife International and Herbalife Israel, claiming that her liver damage resulted from the use of Herbalife products.

Scientific studies in 2007 by doctors at the University Hospital of Bern in Switzerland and the Liver Unit of the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Israel found an association between consumption of Herbalife products and hepatitis. In response, the Spanish Ministry of Health issued an alert asking for caution in consuming Herbalife products. Herbalife stated they were cooperating fully with Spanish authorities, and after investigation, the agency determined no action was required and removed the alert.

In January 2009, the Scientific Committee of the Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition (AESAN) reached the same conclusion. After reviewing cases implicating Herbalife products in Spain, Switzerland, Israel, Finland, France, Italy, Iceland and Portugal, the 12-member scientific panel issued a report concluding: &quot;The analyses of these cases and information regarding their circumstances have not allowed us to establish a causal relationship&quot; between liver anomalies and Herbalife&#x27;s dietary supplements. The panel attributed the cases to metabolic changes from overzealous and unsupervised dieting.

A July 2013 peer-reviewed study published in the &quot;World Journal of Hepatology&quot; reexamined known cases of hepatotoxicity that had previously been linked to consumption of Herbalife products and concluded that using &quot;the liver specific Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences scale, causality was probable in 1 case, unlikely and excluded in the other cases. Thus, causality levels were much lower than hitherto proposed&quot;. In a separate review published less than a year earlier, the same author described the relationship between Herbalife products and reported hepatotoxicity cases as &quot;highly probable&quot;.

In 2019, the &quot;Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology&quot; published a paper titled &quot;Slimming to the Death: Herbalife®-Associated Fatal Acute Liver Failure-Heavy Metals, Toxic Compounds, Bacterial Contaminants and Psychotropic Agents in Products Sold in India.&quot; This paper examined the connection between Herbalife slimming products and a case of fatal acute liver failure in one patient in India. In December 2020, the journal retracted the aforementioned article, contrary to the COPE guidelines, which advise that the original paper should remain available but prominently marked as retracted. According to one of the co-authors of the paper, this retraction happened because Herbalife engaged DSK Legal, a New Delhi-based law firm, to consistently issue legal threats to the journal&#x27;s editor-in-chief.

==Pyramid scheme allegations==
Critics of the company&#x27;s structure have contended that it has operated as a pyramid scheme. They have also argued that the company does not sufficiently work to curb abuses by individual distributors, though Herbalife Nutrition has consistently denied the allegations.

A 2004 settlement resolved a class-action suit on behalf of 8,700 former and current distributors who accused the company and distributors of &quot;essentially running a pyramid scheme&quot;. A total of $6 million was to be paid out, with defendants not admitting guilt.

In November 2011, the Commercial Court in Brussels, Belgium, ruled that Herbalife was an illegal pyramid scheme. The company filed an appeal on March 8, 2012. On December 3, 2013, a Belgian appeals court found for Herbalife, reversing the lower court&#x27;s finding.

On May 1, 2012, a short seller, David Einhorn, asked questions about the company&#x27;s business and sales models during the Q1 earnings call, setting off suspicions that Einhorn had a short position. These suspicions were proved correct in January 2013 when at an investor meeting Einhorn revealed that he had profited through a short position against the company. Einhorn said the short had been closed before the end of 2012.

===Bill Ackman===
On December 20, 2012, Bill Ackman (of Pershing Square Capital) presented a series of arguments outlining why his firm believed that Herbalife operated a &quot;sophisticated pyramid scheme&quot; and contended that its stock would hit zero. Ackman alleged after a year-long investigation that the majority of distributors lose money, that the chance of making the testimonial-implied headline income is approximately one in five thousand, and that the company materially overstates its distributors&#x27; retail sales and understates their recruiting rewards.

According to a number of financial commentators, Ackman bet roughly $1 billion against the company; soon after remarks to the press, the price of the stock decreased such that Ackman would have made $300 million if he had closed his short position then. In March 2015, federal prosecutors and the FBI revealed that they were investigating whether or not individuals paid by Ackman and otherwise had made false statements about Herbalife&#x27;s business model to regulators and others in order to lower the company&#x27;s stock price and influence authorities to conduct an investigation.

In November 2017, Ackman closed out his short position after Herbalife shares increased by 51 percent over the year, and replaced it with a less aggressive put option. In March 2018, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Ackman had &quot;largely exited&quot; his bet against the company, while others reported that the bet against Herbalife had cost his company hundreds of millions of dollars and damaged the confidence of investors in his hedge fund.

===FTC investigation===

Based on information from a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported on February 4, 2013, that Herbalife was subject to a pending probe from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC released 729 pages containing 192 complaints received over a 7-year period in regards to the &quot;New York Post&quot;&#x27;s FOIA request. The FTC stated that the wording it used in its response to the FOIA request was incorrect; the FTC could not confirm or deny an investigation into Herbalife.

In March 2014, the FTC opened an investigation into Herbalife in response to calls from consumer groups and members in both houses of the United States Congress. Herbalife responded to the probe by saying it &quot;welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will cooperate fully with the FTC. We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations&quot;. However, in the press conference, Herbalife was declared not necessarily not a pyramid scheme.

In July 2016, Herbalife agreed to change its business model and pay $200 million in a settlement with the FTC. Partial refund checks were mailed to roughly 350,000 Herbalife distributors in January 2017. The FTC said in a press release about the settlement &quot;it&#x27;s virtually impossible to make money selling Herbalife products.&quot;

The lawsuit alleged that Herbalife deceived consumers into believing they could earn substantial income from the business opportunity or big money from the retail sale of the company&#x27;s products. In addition, the complaint charged that one of the fundamental principles of Herbalife&#x27;s business model—incentivizing distributors to buy products and to recruit others to join and buy products so they could advance in the company&#x27;s marketing program, rather than in response to actual consumer demand—is an unfair practice in violation of the FTC Act.

The company remains under investigation as of early 2019 both by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for corruption in China.

On September 27, 2019, the SEC announced that Herbalife has agreed to pay $20 million to settle charges of making false and misleading statements about its business model and operations in China between 2012 and 2018. The company did not admit or deny the charges but agreed to the settlement terms.

===U.S. Department of Justice investigation of bribery in China===
In 2019, the DOJ charged two of Herbalife&#x27;s employees with conspiracy in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). They were accused of bribing Chinese officials in order to procure sales permits and to influence an investigation into Herbalife. They were also accused of offering bribes to China Economic Net in order to influence their media coverage. In response, Herbalife committed $40 million to resolve the issues, and began negotiations with both the DOJ and SEC. In August 2020, Herbalife agreed to pay $123 million to the DOJ and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

==Sports sponsorships==
Herbalife has sponsored France&#x27;s national volleyball team and the Major League Soccer club LA Galaxy since 2007 and has sponsored Cristiano Ronaldo since 2013. They sponsored FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi between 2010 and 2013. Herbalife has also sponsored the basketball club Herbalife Gran Canaria since 2012. In July 2020, Herbalife also sponsored the Guangzhou Charge of the Overwatch League. In addition to these team and player sponsorships, Turkish Women&#x27;s Basketball Super League has been named &#x27;Herbalife Nutrition Women&#x27;s Basketball Super League&#x27; for three years starting the 2019-2020 regular season.

During the 2020 Summer Olympics, Herbalife Nutrition was a sponsor of the Olympic Committee of Israel and the Indian Olympic Association. In 2023, Herbalife became a sponsor of the Indian Premier League.

In 2023, the company became the main shirt sponsor of the Western Sydney Wanderers FC women&#x27;s football team.

==Media==
In April 2016, a documentary directed by Ted Braun, titled &quot;Betting on Zero&quot;, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. It explored the allegation from Bill Ackman that Herbalife was a pyramid scheme and personal stories of its distributors who lost their life savings. Hilary Rosen, a Democratic lobbyist and an adviser to Herbalife, questioned Tribeca&#x27;s credibility after claiming that the film was &quot;bought and paid&quot; for by Ackman &quot;to make good on his stock bet&quot;.

In 2016, a &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot; segment on multi-level marketing focused on Herbalife; it strongly condemned the company for its structure resembling a pyramid scheme and cited the FTC report, which implied the company had been operating illegitimately. Oliver criticized Herbalife for its exploitation of Latino communities, and overstatement of its products&#x27; health benefits. One reviewer wrote that it appeared to be largely based on &quot;Betting on Zero&quot;, and caused no immediate change in Herbalife&#x27;s stock prices.

The 2018 book &quot;When The Wolves Bite: Two Billionaires, One Company, and an Epic Wall Street Battle&quot; by Scott Wapner discusses Ackman&#x27;s short of the company and his battle with Icahn. In the book, Wapner characterizes Ackman&#x27;s decision to bet against Herbalife as dangerous, because it anticipated that the government would shut Herbalife down.

<text>In mathematics, a Boolean function is a function whose arguments and result assume values from a two-element set (usually {true, false}, {0,1} or {-1,1}). Alternative names are switching function, used especially in older computer science literature, and [[truth function]] (or logical function), used in logic. Boolean functions are the subject of Boolean algebra and switching theory.

A Boolean function takes the form formula_1, where formula_2 is known as the Boolean domain and formula_3 is a non-negative integer called the arity of the function. In the case where formula_4, the function is a constant element of formula_2. A Boolean function with multiple outputs, formula_6 with formula_7 is a vectorial or &quot;vector-valued&quot; Boolean function (an S-box in symmetric cryptography).

There are formula_8 different Boolean functions with formula_3 arguments; equal to the number of different truth tables with formula_10 entries.

Every formula_3-ary Boolean function can be expressed as a propositional formula in formula_3 variables formula_13, and two propositional formulas are logically equivalent if and only if they express the same Boolean function.

== Examples ==
The rudimentary symmetric Boolean functions (logical connectives or logic gates) are:

* NOT, negation or complement - which receives one input and returns true when that input is false (&quot;not&quot;)
* AND or conjunction - true when all inputs are true (&quot;both&quot;)
* OR or disjunction - true when any input is true (&quot;either&quot;)
* XOR or exclusive disjunction - true when one of its inputs is true and the other is false (&quot;not equal&quot;)
* NAND or Sheffer stroke - true when it is not the case that all inputs are true (&quot;not both&quot;)
*NOR or logical nor - true when none of the inputs are true (&quot;neither&quot;)
*XNOR or logical equality - true when both inputs are the same (&quot;equal&quot;)
An example of a more complicated function is the majority function (of an odd number of inputs).

== Representation ==

A Boolean function may be specified in a variety of ways:

* Truth table: explicitly listing its value for all possible values of the arguments
**Marquand diagram: truth table values arranged in a two-dimensional grid (used in a Karnaugh map)
**Binary decision diagram, listing the truth table values at the bottom of a binary tree
**Venn diagram, depicting the truth table values as a colouring of regions of the plane
Algebraically, as a propositional formula using rudimentary Boolean functions:

* Negation normal form, an arbitrary mix of AND and ORs of the arguments and their complements
* Disjunctive normal form, as an OR of ANDs of the arguments and their complements
* Conjunctive normal form, as an AND of ORs of the arguments and their complements
*Canonical normal form, a standardized formula which uniquely identifies the function:
**Algebraic normal form or Zhegalkin polynomial, as a XOR of ANDs of the arguments (no complements allowed)
**&quot;Full&quot; (canonical) disjunctive normal form, an OR of ANDs each containing every argument or complement (minterms)
**&quot;Full&quot; (canonical) conjunctive normal form, an AND of ORs each containing every argument or complement (maxterms)
**Blake canonical form, the OR of all the prime implicants of the function
Boolean formulas can also be displayed as a graph:
* Propositional directed acyclic graph
**Digital circuit diagram of logic gates, a Boolean circuit
**And-inverter graph, using only AND and NOT
In order to optimize electronic circuits, Boolean formulas can be minimized using the Quine–McCluskey algorithm or Karnaugh map.

== Analysis ==
===Properties===

A Boolean function can have a variety of properties:

* Constant: Is always true or always false regardless of its arguments.
* Monotone: for every combination of argument values, changing an argument from false to true can only cause the output to switch from false to true and not from true to false. A function is said to be unate in a certain variable if it is monotone with respect to changes in that variable. 
* Linear: for each variable, flipping the value of the variable either always makes a difference in the truth value or never makes a difference (a parity function).
* Symmetric: the value does not depend on the order of its arguments.
* Read-once: Can be expressed with conjunction, disjunction, and negation with a single instance of each variable.
*Balanced: if its truth table contains an equal number of zeros and ones. The Hamming weight of the function is the number of ones in the truth table.
* Bent: its derivatives are all balanced (the autocorrelation spectrum is zero)
* Correlation immune to &quot;m&quot;th order: if the output is uncorrelated with all (linear) combinations of at most &quot;m&quot; arguments
*Evasive: if evaluation of the function always requires the value of all arguments
*A Boolean function is a &quot;Sheffer function&quot; if it can be used to create (by composition) any arbitrary Boolean function (see functional completeness)
*The &quot;algebraic degree&quot; of a function is the order of the highest order monomial in its algebraic normal form
Circuit complexity attempts to classify Boolean functions with respect to the size or depth of circuits that can compute them.

=== Derived functions ===
A Boolean function may be decomposed using Boole&#x27;s expansion theorem in positive and negative &quot;Shannon&quot; &quot;cofactors&quot; (Shannon expansion), which are the (k-1)-ary functions resulting from fixing one of the arguments (to zero or one). The general (k-ary) functions obtained by imposing a linear constraint on a set of inputs (a linear subspace) are known as &quot;subfunctions&quot;.

The &quot;Boolean derivative&quot; of the function to one of the arguments is a (k-1)-ary function that is true when the output of the function is sensitive to the chosen input variable; it is the XOR of the two corresponding cofactors. A derivative and a cofactor are used in a Reed–Muller expansion. The concept can be generalized as a k-ary derivative in the direction dx, obtained as the difference (XOR) of the function at x and x + dx.

The &quot;Möbius transform&quot; (or &quot;Boole-Möbius transform&quot;) of a Boolean function is the set of coefficients of its polynomial (algebraic normal form), as a function of the monomial exponent vectors. It is a self-inverse transform. It can be calculated efficiently using a butterfly algorithm (&quot;Fast Möbius Transform&quot;), analogous to the Fast Fourier Transform. &quot;Coincident&quot; Boolean functions are equal to their Möbius transform, i.e. their truth table (minterm) values equal their algebraic (monomial) coefficients. There are 2^2^(&quot;k&quot;−1) coincident functions of &quot;k&quot; arguments.

=== Cryptographic analysis ===
The &quot;Walsh transform&quot; of a Boolean function is a k-ary integer-valued function giving the coefficients of a decomposition into linear functions (Walsh functions), analogous to the decomposition of real-valued functions into harmonics by the Fourier transform. Its square is the &quot;power spectrum&quot; or &quot;Walsh spectrum&quot;. The Walsh coefficient of a single bit vector is a measure for the correlation of that bit with the output of the Boolean function. The maximum (in absolute value) Walsh coefficient is known as the &quot;linearity&quot; of the function. The highest number of bits (order) for which all Walsh coefficients are 0 (i.e. the subfunctions are balanced) is known as &quot;resiliency&quot;, and the function is said to be correlation immune to that order. The Walsh coefficients play a key role in linear cryptanalysis.

The &quot;autocorrelation&quot; of a Boolean function is a k-ary integer-valued function giving the correlation between a certain set of changes in the inputs and the function output. For a given bit vector it is related to the Hamming weight of the derivative in that direction. The maximal autocorrelation coefficient (in absolute value) is known as the &quot;absolute indicator&quot;. If all autocorrelation coefficients are 0 (i.e. the derivatives are balanced) for a certain number of bits then the function is said to satisfy the &quot;propagation criterion&quot; to that order; if they are all zero then the function is a bent function. The autocorrelation coefficients play a key role in differential cryptanalysis.

The Walsh coefficients of a Boolean function and its autocorrelation coefficients are related by the equivalent of the Wiener–Khinchin theorem, which states that the autocorrelation and the power spectrum are a Walsh transform pair.

==== Linear approximation table ====
These concepts can be extended naturally to &quot;vectorial&quot; Boolean functions by considering their output bits (&quot;coordinates&quot;) individually, or more thoroughly, by looking at the set of all linear functions of output bits, known as its &quot;components&quot;. The set of Walsh transforms of the components is known as a Linear Approximation Table (LAT) or &quot;correlation matrix&quot;; it describes the correlation between different linear combinations of input and output bits. The set of autocorrelation coefficients of the components is the &quot;autocorrelation table&quot;, related by a Walsh transform of the components to the more widely used &quot;Difference Distribution Table&quot; (DDT) which lists the correlations between differences in input and output bits (see also: S-box).

== Real polynomial form ==
=== On the unit hypercube ===
Any Boolean function formula_14 can be uniquely extended (interpolated) to the real domain by a multilinear polynomial in formula_15, constructed by summing the truth table values multiplied by indicator polynomials:formula_16For example, the extension of the binary XOR function formula_17 isformula_18which equalsformula_19Some other examples are negation (formula_20), AND (formula_21) and OR (formula_22). When all operands are independent (share no variables) a function&#x27;s polynomial form can be found by repeatedly applying the polynomials of the operators in a Boolean formula. When the coefficients are calculated modulo 2 one obtains the algebraic normal form (Zhegalkin polynomial).

Direct expressions for the coefficients of the polynomial can be derived by taking an appropriate derivative:formula_23this generalizes as the Möbius inversion of the partially ordered set of bit vectors:formula_24where formula_25 denotes the weight of the bit vector formula_26. Taken modulo 2, this is the Boolean &quot;Möbius transform&quot;, giving the algebraic normal form coefficients:formula_27In both cases, the sum is taken over all bit-vectors &quot;a&quot; covered by &quot;m&quot;, i.e. the &quot;one&quot; bits of &quot;a&quot; form a subset of the one bits of &quot;m&quot;.

When the domain is restricted to the n-dimensional hypercube formula_28, the polynomial formula_29 gives the probability of a positive outcome when the Boolean function &quot;f&quot; is applied to &quot;n&quot; independent random (Bernoulli) variables, with individual probabilities &quot;x&quot;. A special case of this fact is the piling-up lemma for parity functions. The polynomial form of a Boolean function can also be used as its natural extension to fuzzy logic.

=== On the symmetric hypercube ===
Often, the Boolean domain is taken as formula_30, with false (&quot;0&quot;) mapping to 1 and true (&quot;1&quot;) to -1 (see Analysis of Boolean functions). The polynomial corresponding to formula_31 is then given by:formula_32Using the symmetric Boolean domain simplifies certain aspects of the analysis, since negation corresponds to multiplying by -1 and linear functions are monomials (XOR is multiplication). This polynomial form thus corresponds to the &quot;Walsh transform&quot; (in this context also known as &quot;Fourier transform&quot;) of the function (see above). The polynomial also has the same statistical interpretation as the one in the standard Boolean domain, except that it now deals with the expected values formula_33 (see piling-up lemma for an example).

==Applications==
Boolean functions play a basic role in questions of complexity theory as well as the design of processors for digital computers, where they are implemented in electronic circuits using logic gates.

The properties of Boolean functions are critical in cryptography, particularly in the design of symmetric key algorithms (see substitution box).

In cooperative game theory, monotone Boolean functions are called simple games (voting games); this notion is applied to solve problems in social choice theory.

<text>Manuel Joseph &quot;Jungle Jim&quot; Rivera (July 22, 1921 – November 13, 2017) was an American professional baseball outfielder. He played for three Major League Baseball (MLB) teams over ten seasons: St. Louis Browns (1952), Chicago White Sox (1952–1961), and Kansas City Athletics (1961).

==Career==
Rivera was born to Puerto Rican migrants in New York City. He was first called &quot;Jim&quot; when he was 17, &quot;Big Jim&quot; when he started playing for the Chicago White Sox during the 1952 season, and &quot;Jungle Jim&quot; in 1953 which was initiated by &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; sports writer Edgar Munzel. This was due largely to his unorthodox playing style, and for his highly extroverted personality. Rivera threw and batted left-handed; he stood 6 feet tall and weighed 196 pounds during his playing days. In 1944, Rivera was charged with raping and assaulting an Army officer&#x27;s daughter while in the military. He was found guilty of attempted rape and sentenced to life in prison. Rivera&#x27;s sentence was later reduced, and he was paroled in 1949. In 1953, he led the American League in triples (16) and in 1955 in stolen bases with 25. He was a sparkplug for the 1950s Go-Go White Sox team, eventually winning the American League pennant in 1959.

A smart and fast runner, Rivera ran the bases with abandon, sliding into bases on his belly before it was fashionable, and made many a game-saving catch playing right field. A ground ball hitter, he used his speed to full advantage and was much tougher in clutch situations. However, in that year&#x27;s World Series, which the White Sox lost in six games to the Los Angeles Dodgers, Rivera went hitless in 11 at-bats.

Rivera had a .256 lifetime batting average with 83 home runs, 422 RBIs, 503 runs, 155 doubles, and 56 triples in 1,171 games played. He also had a career total of 160 stolen bases and a lifetime .978 fielding average.

At age 40, Rivera appeared in 64 games for the Kansas City A&#x27;s during the 1961 season, hitting .241 to cap his career. Rivera said Whitey Ford was the &quot;toughest&quot; pitcher he ever faced and he liked it when he was called &quot;Big Jim.&quot;

Rivera would go on to be a part-owner and manager for both the Fort Wayne Scouts (1979) and Fort Wayne Huggie Bears (1980) who played in two men&#x27;s professional softball leagues.

Rivera died on November 13, 2017, at the age of 96.

<doc id="753362" wikidata="Q2338071" url="?curid=753362" title="Asiatic–Pacific Campaign Medal">
<text>The Asiatic–Pacific Campaign Medal was a United States military award of the Second World War, which was awarded to any member of the United States Armed Forces who served in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater from 1941 to 1945. The medal was created on November 6, 1942, by issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The medal was designed by Thomas Hudson Jones; the reverse side was designed by Adolph Alexander Weinman which is the same design as used on the reverse of the American Campaign Medal and European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal.

There were 21 Army and 48 Navy-Marine Corps official campaigns of the Pacific Theater, denoted on the suspension and service ribbon of the medal by service stars which also were called &quot;battle stars&quot;; some Navy construction battalion units issued the medal with Arabic numerals. The Arrowhead device is authorized for those campaigns which involved participation in amphibious assault landings. The Fleet Marine Force Combat Operation Insignia is also authorized for wear on the medal for Navy service members who participated in combat while assigned to a Marine Corps unit. The flag colors of the United States and Japan are visible in the ribbon.

The Asiatic–Pacific Campaign Medal was first issued as a service ribbon in 1942. A full medal was authorized in 1947, the first of which was presented to General of the Army Douglas MacArthur. The European Theater equivalent of the medal was known as the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal.

Boundaries of Asiatic-Pacific Theater.
(1) The eastern boundary is coincident with the western boundary of the American Theater.
(2) The western boundary is from the North Pole south along the 60th meridian east longitude to its intersection with the east boundary of Iran, then south along the Iran boundary to the Gulf of Oman and the intersection of the 60th meridian east longitude, then south along the 60th meridian east longitude to the South Pole.

<doc id="753367" wikidata="Q716366" url="?curid=753367" title="Niimi Nishiki">
<text>was born in Mito-han (now Ibaraki Prefecture). He was a master of the &quot;Shintomunen-ryu&quot; swordsmanship style. He was one of the original thirteen members of the Shinsengumi, together with Serizawa Kamo and Kondō Isami. 

== Name ==
Although he took the name Niimi Nishiki, his real name remains obscure. Scholars have speculated that his real name may have been Niinomi Kumetarō (). He is assumed to have been well educated, because the name Niimi Nishiki shows a play of pronunciation.

== Shinsengumi ==
Nishiki was originally one of the three commanders with Kondo and Serizawa but later he had his rank lowered to vice-commander. 

There are speculations that he could have been a spy for the Chōshū Domain and that he also had close connections with Sonnō jōi groups in Mito and Tosa Province. 

== Death ==
Being an important member of the Serizawa faction, Nishiki was later forced by Yamanami Keisuke and Hijikata Toshizō to commit seppuku around October 19 (by the lunar calendar, the 10th day of the ninth month), 1863. Serizawa and the other members of his group were assassinated about a week later by order of Matsudaira Katamori, the &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Aizu clan.

<text>Benaiah (, &quot;Yahweh builds up&quot;) is a common name in the Hebrew Bible.

== Etymology ==
In the etymology of the name, the first part of Benaiah comes from the root-verb בנה (bana), which is a common Hebrew verb meaning &quot;to build&quot;. The second part of Benaiah is יה (Yah), which is not a derivative of the Tetragrammaton, but a contraction of it (ie, the first and last consonants of יהוה are contracted as יה).

== Benaiah, son of Jehoiada ==
The most famous Benaiah referenced in the Tanakh is the son of Jehoiada, who came from the southern Judean town of Kabzeel.

According to the text, Benaiah was one of David&#x27;s Mighty Warriors, commander of the third rotational army division; (; ). He helped David&#x27;s son Solomon become king, killed Solomon&#x27;s enemies, and served as the chief of Solomon&#x27;s army. On Solomon&#x27;s instructions he was responsible for the deaths of Adonijah (), Joab () and Shimei (). He was in charge of the Cherethites and Pelethites. Several verses in illustrate Benaiah&#x27;s close association with Solomon&#x27;s party and his exclusion from Adonijah&#x27;s faction. He is also mentioned in , , and .

== Gravesite ==
According to Rabbi Hayyim Vital, the grave of Benaiah is in Biriya. In 1869, Rabbi Yosef Hayyimm of Baghdad visited the grave and stayed there for a few days. In the introduction to his book, &quot;Ben Ish Chai&quot;, he wrote that &quot;many and great secrets&quot; were revealed to him there, and even that &quot;his soul came from the soul of Baniahu ben Yehoida,&quot; and that is why he named his books after him.

== Other Benaiahs ==
Other Benaiahs depicted in the Hebrew Bible include:
*Another of David&#x27;s mighty men, an Ephraimite from Pirathon, commander of the 11th rotational army division (1 Chr. 11:31, 1 Chr. 27:14, 2 Sam. 23:30)
* A Levite musician who played his stringed instrument while accompanying the Ark of the Covenant when it was brought to Jerusalem and placed in the tent David had prepared for it (1 Chr. 15:18, 20; 16:1, 5).
* A priest who played the trumpet when the Ark was brought to Jerusalem during David&#x27;s reign (1 Chr. 15:24; 16:6).
* A Levite descendant of Asaph, son of Berachiah the Gershonite (2 Chr. 20:14).
* A Simeonite, possibly a contemporary of King Hezekiah (1 Chr. 4:24, 36–43).
* A Levite appointed by Hezekiah to help care for the bounteous contributions to Jehovah&#x27;s house (2 Chr. 31:12, 13).
* Father of Pelatiah, one of the wicked princes seen in Ezekiel’s vision (Eze. 11:1, 13).
* Four men who, at Ezra&#x27;s admonition, dismissed their foreign wives and sons. These four were descendants of Parosh, Pahath-Moab, Bani, and Nebo respectively (Ezr. 10:25, 30, 34, 35, 43, 44).

<doc id="753380" wikidata="Q1144961" url="?curid=753380" title="Cursive (band)">
<text>Cursive is an American indie rock band from Omaha, Nebraska. Stylistically described as emo and post-hardcore, Cursive came to prominence with 2000&#x27;s &quot;Domestica&quot; and found commercial and critical success with 2003&#x27;s &quot;The Ugly Organ&quot;. The band has released eight studio albums, a compilations album, and a mix of singles and EPs since 1997. They have released recordings on several labels, including 15 Passenger Records, Saddle Creek Records, and Big Scary Monsters (UK).

Cursive&#x27;s influences include such bands as Fugazi, Shudder to Think, Superchunk, Archers of Loaf and Brainiac.

==History==

=== Early years and breakup (1995–98) ===
Cursive formed in the spring of 1995, shortly after Slowdown Virginia broke up. Slowdown Virginia members Tim Kasher (lead vocals, guitar), Matt Maginn (bass), and Steve Pedersen (guitar) had parted ways, along with their drummer, a month prior. The three members decided that they were not ready to give up making music, and wanted to give music a serious try, with Kasher saying, &quot;[we] decided with Cursive we would write the best we could, believe in it, and if everyone ended up hating it – well, we would deal with it.&quot; Clint Schnase, who played with Pedersen in a band called Smashmouth, joined as the drummer. Kasher has said that the band&#x27;s name was inspired by a passage in a book by V. S. Naipaul, in which the British were forcing subjugated Indians to learn how to write English in cursive penmanship, symbolic of a pointless exercise with no value, and Kasher compares this to the band forcing music as a discipline, taking it seriously.

With an initial sound characterized by one reviewer as similar to At the Drive-In, in 1996 Cursive recorded and released &quot;The Disruption&quot; EP on Lumberjack Records, followed in 1997 by the &quot;Sucker and Dry&quot; EP on Zero Hour Records and their debut album, &quot;Such Blinding Stars for Starving Eyes&quot;, on Crank! Records. A follow-up EP, &quot;The Icebreaker,&quot; was released in early 1998. The Katz brothers of &quot;Sputnik Music&quot; summarize &quot;Such Blinding Stars&quot; and Cursive&#x27;s sound at the time as &quot;11 distortion soaked, emotion ridden songs, comes off as a younger, worse, version of the band&#x27;s breakthrough &quot;Domestica&quot;&quot; while &quot;AllMusic&quot;&#x27;s Peter D&#x27;Angelo said the album &quot;lays down the framework for the Cursive method: delicate guitars that erupt into frenzied explosions, a rhythm section that consistently keeps each track barreling forward, and the harrowing vocal contributions of Tim Kasher.&quot;

In late spring of 1998, after a couple years of touring, Cursive announced that they were breaking up. The primary cause was Kasher&#x27;s marriage and move with his wife to Portland, Oregon, though guitarist Pedersen was planning on also leaving the band and Omaha to attend law school in North Carolina. Cursive recorded &quot;The Storms of Early Summer: Semantics of Song&quot; as a swan song in the spring of &#x27;98 before disbanding, and released the album post-breakup in the fall of that year on Saddle Creek Records. &quot;The Storms of Early Summer&quot; was Kasher and Cursive&#x27;s first foray into writing and recording a concept album, with the first half of the album being themed &quot;Man vs. Nature&quot; and the second half &quot;Man vs. Self&quot;. The album was noted for its intricate guitar work, deeply thoughtful lyrics, and the beginnings of a math-rock/pop song structure, all of which would develop more on further Cursive albums.

=== Reformation: &quot;Domestica&quot; and &quot;Burst and Bloom&quot; (1999–2002) ===
A little over a year later, in the summer of 1999, the band re-formed when Kasher got divorced and returned to Omaha. With Pedersen gone to law school, Ted Stevens (formerly of Lullaby for the Working Class) joined the band on guitar and vocals. Within a year Cursive recorded and released their third full-length album, &quot;Domestica&quot;, in 2000. A concept album about the dissolution of a marriage, &quot;Domestica&quot; gained Cursive critical success for the first time. While not a straightforward autobiographical account of his marriage, Kasher has acknowledged that it heavily influenced the album, though some of the relationship dynamics – such as infidelity – were not autobiographical. Reviewing &quot;Domestica&quot;, &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s Taylor Clark gave the album an 8.0/10.0, calling Tim Kasher&#x27;s style as &quot;the perfect inflection and expression from the far-from-perfect vocal chords, the brains evident behind the guitar brawn&quot; and that the band&#x27;s sound had evolved since &quot;The Storms of Early Summer&quot;, saying that Cursive &quot;retained their razor edge, creating pulsing, rapidly evolving guitar-based music, yet they&#x27;re now fueled and guided by the meaning behind the music&quot;.

Cursive added Gretta Cohn as a cellist in 2001, as Kasher felt the addition would help the band evolve its sound. They recorded and released 2001&#x27;s &quot;Burst and Bloom&quot; EP on Saddle Creek Records, and split an album with Japanese band Eastern Youth in 2002 called &quot;8 Teeth to Eat You&quot; on Better Looking Records. &quot;Burst and Bloom&quot;&#x27;s lead-off track, &quot;Sink to the Beat&quot;, is a lyrically meta-concept song about the process of recording the EP itself and the effect it has on the music and the listener. Cursive toured extensively throughout 2001 and 2002, to the point of exhaustion and Kasher suffering a collapsed lung. The band had to cancel the rest of the tour and returned to writing new material.

=== &quot;The Ugly Organ&quot; and hiatus (2003–05) ===
Cursive released &quot;The Ugly Organ,&quot; their fourth album, in 2003 on Saddle Creek Records to critical and commercial success. Music magazine &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a 4-star rating, while alternative music magazine &quot;Alternative Press&quot; rated the album a perfect 5 out of 5. At the time of &quot;The Ugly Organ&quot;&#x27;s tenth anniversary reissue in 2014, the album had sold over 170,000 records.

&quot;The Ugly Organ&quot; is a loose concept album about the ideas of what art and music are, how the song, singer, and audience all relate and influence each other, and the emotional effects of the songwriting process on the writer. Kasher stated in an interview with &quot;Alternative Press&quot; in 2014 that the songs he wrote were not written to be tight conceptually, and credits guitarist and sometimes-vocalist Ted Stevens with finding the theme to the album, saying, &quot;Really, Ted [Stevens, guitar] had a large role in laying the songs out and considering what they all meant and how they related to each other and creating a higher concept from the artwork, of the theatrical layout.&quot; The addition of Cohn&#x27;s cello to the music was noted by Adam Finley of &quot;Pop Matters&quot; as helping to give songs a &quot;sense of epic scale&quot; and &quot;threatening edge&quot;, and that the songs overall sounded as though &quot;all roads led through a haunted house of grotesque situations and twisted characters, each a reflection through a broken carnival mirror of Kasher converting pounds of flesh into something saleable.&quot;

After extensive touring to support &quot;The Ugly Organ&quot; in 2003 and early 2004, Kasher surprised fans and critics by announcing an indefinite hiatus for Cursive in the fall of 2004 once they finished their tour with The Cure. Lead singer and songwriter Tim Kasher took time to focus on his other band, The Good Life, which he had formed in 2000 and whose third release, 2004&#x27;s &quot;Album of the Year&quot;, was enjoying critical success. Ted Stevens worked on his other band, Mayday, along with bassist Matt Maginn, releasing their third album, &quot;Bushido Karaoke&quot;, in 2005. Drummer Clint Schnase along with bassist Matt Maginn toured with Bright Eyes, including 2004&#x27;s Vote for Change Cellist Gretta Cohn decided to depart the band permanently, relocating to New York City.

Saddle Creek Records put out a Cursive compilation album, &quot;The Difference Between Houses and Homes&quot;, on August 9, 2005. These songs were collected from &quot;The Disruption&quot;, &quot;Sucker and Dry&quot; and &quot;The Icebreaker&quot; EPs, as well as some b-sides and unreleased material recorded between 1995 and 2001.

=== &quot;Happy Hollow&quot; and &quot;Mama, I&#x27;m Swollen&quot; (2006–11) ===
Cursive&#x27;s hiatus ceased in 2006 when Saddle Creek announced that Kasher had temporarily stopped his work on his side project, The Good Life, to start recording Cursive&#x27;s fifth studio album. &quot;Happy Hollow&quot; was released on August 22, 2006. Its first single was &quot;Dorothy at Forty&quot;, released on July 11, 2006. Named for the Dundee-Happy Hollow Historic District in Omaha, Nebraska, where Warren Buffett lives, with this album Kasher turned his focus away from self-reflective lyrics to concentrate on what he thought were corrupt politics, bland and empty suburban lives, and Christian hypocrisy. The album received generally favorable reviews. Music magazines &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;URB&quot;, &quot;Time Out New York&quot;, and &quot;Blender&quot; gave the record a 4 star rating, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a 3.5-star rating, while alternative music magazine &quot;Alternative Press&quot; rated the album a perfect 5 out of 5, saying &quot;Cursive haven&#x27;t just redefined their sound—they&#x27;ve transcended it.&quot; &quot;Happy Hollow&quot; features a five-piece horn section, adding new texture and redefining the band&#x27;s sound in place of Cohn&#x27;s departed cello.

Cursive&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Mama, I&#x27;m Swollen&quot; was released on March 10, 2009 on Saddle Creek Records. Three days later, the band made their network television debut on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, playing &quot;From The Hips&quot;&quot;&quot;. The album was the first recorded without drummer Clint Schnase, who departed the band in October of 2007. Schnase was replaced on drums with Matt &quot;Cornbread&quot; Compton, who had previously been touring with the band. Retaining the horns used on &quot;Happy Hollow, Mama, I&#x27;m Swollen&quot; has a more straightforward rock sound mixed with shifts in keys and time signatures to break up the potential for monotony. Thematically, &quot;Mama, I&#x27;m Swollen&quot; returns to much of the &quot;romantic narcissism&quot; found in &quot;Domestica&quot; and loses most of the political focus of &quot;Happy Hollow&quot;, instead concentrating on the futility of adult life and the &quot;worthlessness of humanity, and the Peter Pan Syndrome of adults who want to &#x27;live life duty free&#x27; or fuck away their fears.&quot; &quot;Mama, I&#x27;m Swollen&quot; failed to garner the critical success of the past few Cursive albums, with a &quot;weighted average&quot; score of 65 on Metacritic, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

=== &quot;I Am Gemini&quot; (2012–2014) ===
The follow-up to &quot;Mama, I&#x27;m Swollen&quot;, called &quot;I Am Gemini&quot;, was released on February 21, 2012 on Saddle Creek Records. Cornbread Compton was replaced by Cully Symington prior to recording the album. With a lyric sheet described by Ian Cohen of &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot; as a &quot;full-blown libretto&quot;, &quot;I Am Gemini&quot; is presented as a play, telling the story of &quot;twin brothers separated at birth, one good and one evil, their unexpected reunion in a house that is not a home ignites a classic struggle for the soul.&quot; The album has been characterized as difficult to access musically, with &quot;Paste Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Tyler Kain saying &quot;[Cursive&#x27;s] signature parts are still there with those gnarled, winding guitar parts and Matt Maginn&#x27;s melodic, grounded bass lines. But the exploration of off-kilter changes, funny time signatures and near-metal breakdowns can make &quot;Gemini&quot; a hard first listen.&quot; &quot;I Am Gemini&quot; received a similar critical evaluation as &quot;Mama, I&#x27;m Swollen&quot;, scoring a measure of 63 on &quot;weighted average&quot; from Metacritic, or generally favorable reviews.

&quot;The Ugly Organ&quot; was reissued by Cursive and Saddle Creek in 2014, featuring four additional tracks originally released on &quot;8 Teeth to Eat You&quot; and four songs from singles and compilations. Cursive went on a brief tour in the spring of 2014 to support the reissue.

=== 15 Passenger, &quot;Vitriola&quot;, and &quot;Get Fixed&quot; (2017–present) ===
Cursive launched their own record label in early 2017, 15 Passenger. The debut release for the label was a new solo album from Kasher, &quot;No Resolution&quot;. The band reissued their first two albums through 15 Passenger in the fall of 2017, with plans to continue reissuing all of their releases through the label as well as new material. In addition to Cursive&#x27;s and Kasher&#x27;s work, 15 Passenger releases material from other artists as well.

In August 2018, Cursive announced their eighth studio album &quot;Vitriola&quot;. It was also announced that Clint Schnase would be returning to the band in order for previous drummer Symington to focus on recording and touring with Sparta. The album also features contributions from cellist Megan Siebe, who had previously toured alongside Kasher in an acoustic duo mode. This marks the first Cursive album to feature cello since &quot;The Ugly Organ&quot;. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Life Savings&quot;, was released on the same day.

&quot;Get Fixed&quot;, the band&#x27;s ninth studio album, was announced alongside the release of the song &quot;Stranded Satellite&quot; on October 1, 2019. &quot;Get Fixed&quot; was released digitally on October 11, 2019. Vinyl and compact disc versions were released on January 17, 2020. Songs from the album were primarily written and recorded during the sessions for &quot;Vitriola&quot; with the intent of releasing a double album. The band ended up planning the songs for a second album, and wrote some new material to accompany the songs recorded during &quot;Vitriola&quot;. The album&#x27;s announcement was preceded by the release of the songs &quot;Barricades&quot;, &quot;Black Hole Town&quot;, and &quot;Marigolds&quot; in September 2019.

<text>Timothy J. Kasher (born August 19, 1974) is an American musician from Omaha, Nebraska, and is the frontman of indie rock groups Cursive and the Good Life, both of which are on the Omaha-based record label Saddle Creek Records.

== Music ==
=== Slowdown Virginia ===

Slowdown Virginia was formed in Omaha in 1993 by Kasher with Matt Maginn, Steve Pedersen, and Casey Caniglia after the dissolution of a previous band called The March Hares. With a sound described as a heartland Pavement and into the Pixies, Slowdown Virginia recorded and released one album, &quot;Dead Space&quot;, on Lumberjack Records, with the help of funding from friends. The band was short lived, breaking up in 1995, but it inspired other bands to form in Omaha like The Faint and Bright Eyes, the formation of Saddle Creek Records out of Lumberjack Records, and the name of Omaha&#x27;s indie music venue, Slowdown.

=== Cursive ===

Kasher, Maginn, and Pedersen formed a new band, Cursive, in 1995, adding Clint Schnase to the band. The bands released two albums, described as full of emotion and distortion, before disbanding in 1998 as Kasher moved to Portland, Oregon, after getting married. Kasher also spent some of this time playing guitar in Commander Venus, recording and releasing two albums. Pedersen left Omaha to study law at Duke University in North Carolina shortly afterward.

Kasher&#x27;s marriage and time away from Omaha did not last long; he returned within eighteen months of leaving Cursive and Omaha. With Pedersen away, Kasher recruited Ted Stevens to join the previous other band members. The re-formed Cursive soon recorded and released their third album, &quot;Domestica,&quot; at Presto! Studios in Omaha, using the stock room of the USA Baby store where Kasher worked as the band&#x27;s practice space. &quot;Domestica&quot; showed this version of Cursive to have a tight-knit, hard-rock sound with the addition of Stevens as well as Kasher&#x27;s newfound focus on introspective, storytelling focused lyrics. Cursive added cellist Gretta Cohn for the next several releases and the band, and Kasher&#x27;s writing, found critical success with 2003&#x27;s &quot;The Ugly Organ&quot;, a &quot;gale force&quot; of &quot;personal indigence.&quot;

Cohn departed Cursive in 2005, and the band continued on without a cellist. Cursive has subsequently recorded and released three more studio albums, also concept albums - a style that Kasher began loosely with &quot;The Storms of Early Summer: Semantics of Song&quot; and developed full-blown with &quot;Domestica&quot;. Cursive&#x27;s last release was &quot;Vitriola&quot; in 2018.

=== The Good Life ===

The Good Life was originally planned to be a solo project. Kasher wanted to experiment with different types of lyrics and melodies. He released &quot;Novena on a Nocturn&quot; under the name the Good Life on Better Looking Records in 2000, five months after Cursive&#x27;s &quot;Domestica&quot;. &quot;Novena on a Nocturn&quot; touched on the same themes of &quot;Domestica&quot;, mainly ones of divorce and loss, and was noted in reviews for Kashers intense focus on his lyrics and personal storytelling. 2002&#x27;s &quot;Black Out&quot; was also a mostly solo effort with friends assisting in the recording, and was released on Saddle Creek Records. As with &quot;Novena&quot;, the album was noted for its focus on melodies and lyrics, with Dan Ocean of &quot;Punk News&quot; describing the sound as &quot;a slower paced Cursive with some electronica and an abundance of hooks.&quot;

After using the Good Life as essentially a side project, Kasher decided to make the Good Life a full-fledged band. Kasher recruited Ryan Fox, Roger Lewis, and Stefanie Drootin-Senseney and released &quot;Album of the Year&quot; in 2004. Despite his intention to make the Good Life a band in its own right, Kasher still retained most creative control over the band for much of &quot;Album of the Year&quot; and similarly for 2007&#x27;s &quot;Help Wanted Nights&quot;, described by &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s Eric Harvey as &quot;two consecutive concept albums dealing with boozers and their second homes.&quot;

The Good Life took a break after 2007. Kasher released two albums with Cursive and two solo albums before reconvening the Good Life in late 2013. This time Kasher approached the Good Life with recording the album as a band, with all members contributing to the process of writing the songs. The result was the rock-oriented &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Coming Down&quot;, released in September 2015.

=== Solo work ===
His first solo album, &quot;The Game of Monogamy&quot;, was released to mixed reviews on October 5, 2010, on Saddle Creek Records. Written after Kasher moved from Los Angeles to Montana, Kasher&#x27;s first truly solo work was noted for its lyricism and instrumentation but also for again repeating on the themes of a broken romance that dominated early releases by the Good Life and Cursive&#x27;s &quot;Domestica&quot;. Chris Parker from &quot;Alternative Press&quot; called the album &quot;overture to middle age and the declining allure of the bars and hook-ups scene.&quot; The follow-up EP, &quot;&quot;, was released in August 2011. &quot;Bigamy&quot; continues the same themes as &quot;Monogamy&quot; with seven additional songs.

&quot;Adult Film&quot;, Kasher&#x27;s second solo album, was released on Saddle Creek Records in 2013. Featuring a more reserved vocal style and stripped-down instrumentation as compared to &quot;The Game of Monogamy&quot;, &quot;Adult Film&quot;&#x27;s topic touch on mistrust, anxiety, and the fears of adult life.

Kasher&#x27;s fourth solo album, &quot;Middling Age&quot;, was released in April 2022.

== Musical style and influences ==
&quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s Taylor Clark once described Kasher&#x27;s singing as &quot;perhaps the worst great voice in indie rock,&quot; noting his lack of ease in singing with a range and a deficiency in enunciation. His voice is commonly recognized as a signature part of Cursive&#x27;s sound. Kasher&#x27;s songwriting receives similar attention, particularly 2003&#x27;s &quot;The Ugly Organ&quot;, which took an introspective meta view on the songwriting process itself. For his part, Kasher has said that a lot of the inspiration for grand visions for his solo albums came from David Bowie. Kasher cites Bowie for helping him to &quot;wake me up to, well, you can do whatever you want. I mean, you’re doing a solo record. You can go in absolutely any direction.&quot; Even prior to this, Kasher&#x27;s writing for albums moved more and more towards a screenplay style of writing, to the point of the lyric sheet for &quot;I Am Gemini&quot; being described by one reviewer as &quot;a full-blown &quot;libretto&quot;.&quot;

== Personal life ==

In 2007, Kasher moved from Omaha to Los Angeles, California. While also working on new music with both Cursive and the Good Life, he took up writing screenplays. In late 2009, he relocated to Montana to focus more explicitly on his writing. He is currently again living in Los Angeles.

He has an undergraduate degree in English, with a minor in Philosophy. He has stated that if he was not pursuing music full-time, he would have become an English professor, teaching writing or literature.

He is the youngest of six children, with four older sisters and one older brother.

In 2015, Kasher married his long-term girlfriend Gwynedd Stuart, the managing editor at &quot;Sporked&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sporked.com/author&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, a feature film &quot;No Resolution&quot; — written and directed by Kasher starring Maura Kidwell and Layne Manzer — was released. In an interview with &quot;The Reader&quot;, Kasher said an earlier version premiered at the Omaha Film Festival a year prior in 2016.

<text>Douglas Peter Savant (born June 21, 1964) is an American actor. He is known for his roles as Matt Fielding in the Fox prime time soap opera &quot;Melrose Place&quot; (1992–97), Tom Scavo in ABC comedy-drama &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; (2004–12), and as Sgt. O&#x27;Neal in &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1998).

== Early life ==
Savant was born and raised in Burbank, California. He attended University of California, Los Angeles, but left before graduating to pursue his acting career. 

==Career==
Savant began his career appearing in teen comedy films &quot;Secret Admirer&quot; and &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; in 1985, and the following year appeared in horror film &quot;Trick or Treat&quot;. From 1986 to 1987, he had a recurring role as a younger version of Mac McKenzie (played by Kevin Dobson) in the CBS prime time soap opera &quot;Knots Landing&quot;. He was paired with future &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; co-star Nicollette Sheridan, who played a younger version of the Anne Matheson character portrayed by Michelle Phillips. In 1988, he co-starred in erotic thriller film &quot;Masquerade&quot; alongside Rob Lowe and Kim Cattrall

From 1992 to 1997, Savant starred as Matt Fielding in the Fox prime time soap opera &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, a role that was notable for being one of the first openly gay lead characters on a television series. However, his role was censored greatly by the network - notably a kiss between Matt and guest star Ty Miller during the season two finale was edited out at the last minute by FOX. Savant left the series after five seasons and, a year later, his character was killed off-screen in a car crash. In 1998, he appeared in monster film &quot;Godzilla&quot; playing Sgt. O&#x27;Neal, and the following years had guest-starring roles on &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, &quot;Profiler&quot;, &quot;Firefly&quot;, &quot;JAG&quot;, &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. In 2004, he had a four-episode arc on &quot;24&quot;.

In 2004, Savant was cast as Tom Scavo in the ABC comedy-drama series, &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. In the first season (2004–05), Tom was originally credited as a recurring role throughout Season 1, but became credited as a series regular in Season 2. Married to Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman), he was out of town regularly on business. Viewer response to Savant and his character led the producers to contract him as a series regular from season two onwards, and Tom and Lynette were portrayed as the most stable couple on the series. The series ended in 2012, and the following years, Savant had guest-starring roles in a number of shows, including &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;, &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, &quot;9-1-1&quot; and &quot;NCIS&quot;.

==Personal life==
In May 1998, he married his &quot;Melrose Place&quot; co-star Laura Leighton. They have two children together: Jack (born October 10, 2000) and Lucy (born June 9, 2005). Savant also has two children from a previous marriage whom Leighton helped raise, Arianna (born January 17, 1992) and Madeline (born July 20, 1993).

<doc id="753400" wikidata="Q507495" url="?curid=753400" title="Andrew Shue">
<text>Andrew Shue (born February 20, 1967) is an American actor, known for his role as Billy Campbell on the television series &quot;Melrose Place&quot; (1992–1999). Shue played soccer professionally for several years. He co-founded and served on the board of directors of the global non-profit organization Do Something, and co-founded the social networking website CafeMom.

==Early life==
Shue was born in Wilmington, Delaware. His mother, Anne Brewster (née Wells; born 1938), is a bank executive who was the vice president of the private division of the Chemical Bank Corporation. His father, James William Shue (born 1936 – died May 24, 2013), was a lawyer and real estate developer who was the president of the International Food and Beverage Corporation and was active in Republican politics, having once unsuccessfully run for the U.S. Congress in New Jersey. His mother was a descendant of Pilgrim leader William Brewster and his father was of German ancestry, from Pennsylvania.

Shue&#x27;s sister Elisabeth is an actress; in three of his early uncredited film appearances, he appeared with her in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;, &quot;Cocktail&quot; and &quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot;.

Shue attended Columbia High School in Maplewood, New Jersey. Along with his sister, he was inducted into the CHS Hall of fame in 1994. At Dartmouth College, Shue was a Regional All America soccer player and spent a winter studying and playing soccer in Glasgow, Scotland for Queen&#x27;s Park FC. Shue received his B.A. in history from Dartmouth in 1989. After graduating, he visited Zimbabwe, where he simultaneously played soccer and taught high school math at Founders High School.

==Career==
===Acting===
In May 1992, Shue was cast to play the role of Billy Campbell on the Aaron Spelling soap opera &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. He starred opposite Courtney Thorne-Smith, whom he later dated. Shue stayed on the show for six years. During this time, he appeared as an abusive husband in the Francis Ford Coppola film &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;, starring Matt Damon and Claire Danes.

A 1996 commercial for &quot;SportsCenter&quot; on ESPN has Shue being traded for former &quot;SportsCenter&quot; anchor Charley Steiner, where Steiner takes his position on &quot;Melrose Place&quot; and Shue takes his on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;.

He worked on the 2007 feature film, &quot;Gracie&quot;, with his sister Elisabeth, his brother John, and his brother-in-law, Davis Guggenheim, the Oscar-winning director of &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;. Shue co-produced the film and also appeared in a minor role. It pays tribute to the Shue siblings&#x27; elder brother Will, who died in an accident in 1988. The story is loosely based on Elisabeth&#x27;s childhood, when she was the only girl playing on an all-boys soccer team.

===Soccer===
During his time in Zimbabwe, Shue played for Bulawayo Highlanders. That season, the Highlanders won both Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League and CBZ Cup titles. At the time, Shue was the only white player in the Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League. In September 1993, he played one game with Los Angeles United of the Continental Indoor Soccer League. In July 1994, he played two games for the Anaheim Splash. In 1996, while still on &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, Shue played for the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer, recording one assist in five games. He spent the entire 1997 season on injured reserve.

===Entrepreneur===
Along with his childhood best friend Michael Sanchez, Shue co-founded DoSomething. He now sits on the board of directors.

In 2006, Shue and Sanchez co-founded the social networking website CafeMom. Lead investors are Highland Capital Partners and Draper Fisher Jurvetson. The site used to provide an online community for moms to connect and share advice and ideas. CafeMom&#x27;s community forums were shut down at 5:00 pm EST on May 24, 2018. The company cited high advertising costs as the reason for the shutdown. The CafeMom is now a family of companies, including blog The Stir, Baby Name Wizard and popular Latina site MamasLatinas.

Shue co-hosted the podcast &quot;Mad Life&quot; with his mother-in-law, Joan Robach, and comedian Chuck Nice.

==Personal life==
Shue married floral designer Jennifer Hageney in 1994. They have three sons. They divorced in 2008.

In 2010, Shue married &quot;Good Morning America&quot; co-anchor and ABC News correspondent Amy Robach. She has two daughters from a previous marriage. It was reported he and Robach separated in August 2022 due to Robach&#x27;s affair with T. J. Holmes. The divorce was reportedly finalized in March 2023.

<doc id="753401" wikidata="Q1325974" url="?curid=753401" title="Electric Wizard">
<text>Electric Wizard is an English stoner/doom metal band from Dorset. Formed in 1988 under the name Lord of Putrefaction, the band have recorded nine studio albums, two of which have been considered genre landmarks: &quot;Come my Fanatics…&quot; (1997) and &quot;Dopethrone&quot; (2000). Electric Wizard&#x27;s brand of doom metal incorporates stoner and sludge traits, with lyrics focussing on the occult, witchcraft, H. P. Lovecraft, horror films, and cannabis. 

==History==

===Pre-Electric Wizard (1988-1993)===
The origins of Electric Wizard go back to 1988 when Jus Oborn formed the band Lord of Putrefaction. They put out three demo tapes from 1989 to 1991 and also recorded a split album with Mortal Remains. In 1992, the name was changed to Thy Grief Eternal after Adam Richardson left the band. They put out one demo under this name titled &quot;On Blackened Wings&quot;. In 1993, James Evans left the band and they once again changed their name, shortening it to Eternal. The band released two demos under this name. After Gavin Gillingham left the band, Oborn started Electric Wizard. The recordings from this era were issued on the &quot;Pre-Electric Wizard 1989-1994&quot; compilation in 2006.

===Formation, debut album, &quot;Come my Fanatics&quot;, &quot;Dopethrone,&quot; and &quot;Let Us Prey&quot; (1993–2003)===
The band adopted the name Electric Wizard during 1993, composed of guitarist-vocalist Jus Oborn, bassist Tim Bagshaw, and drummer Mark Greening. The band&#x27;s name was taken from two Black Sabbath songs: &quot;Electric Funeral&quot; and &quot;The Wizard&quot;. Oborn remarked, &quot;Is the name Electric Wizard made out of two Black Sabbath song titles? Hahahaha, yeah it is!&quot;

In 1995, the band signed to Rise Above Records and released their self-titled debut album. The music was in the vein of traditional doom metal, and received positive reviews. Later that year, they released the song &quot;Demon Lung&quot; as a split-single with Our Haunted Kingdom (later to become Orange Goblin).

In 1997, the band recorded and released &quot;Come My Fanatics…&quot;, which introduced the stoner and sludge elements that have come to define Electric Wizard&#x27;s sound. Later that year, Man&#x27;s Ruin Records released the &quot;Chrono.Naut&quot; EP. Following the release of &quot;Come My Fanatics...&quot; Electric Wizard released the &quot;Supercoven&quot; EP on Bad Acid Records in 1998 and then recorded and released &quot;Dopethrone&quot; in 2000, which was described by Allmusic as a &quot;dirge masterpiece&quot; and is regarded as the band&#x27;s magnum opus. Kerrang! has noted that despite the &quot;groovy&quot; stoner rock vibes usually associated with the band, lyrics for songs like &quot;We Hate You&quot; were more like &quot;an indiscriminate spray of bile against everyone&quot; than the typical stoner rock themes of &quot;shagging and cars&quot;.

During the three years following the release of &quot;Come my Fanatics...&quot;, the members of Electric Wizard encountered a series of setbacks, with Oborn suffering a collapsed eardrum during a concert and later severing a fingertip while laying a carpet. Greening broke his collarbone in an accident. Speaking to &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in July 2009, Jus Oborn remembered the days of the recording:

Their next album, &quot;Let Us Prey&quot;, was released in 2002. It was Electric Wizard&#x27;s most experimental record to date. Following the release, the band embarked on a North American tour that raised tensions between band members. It was announced that the band was breaking up after the last concert of the tour. However, Electric Wizard did a UK tour with Cathedral soon after, with Justin Greaves (of Iron Monkey) on drums. In April 2003, Greening and Bagshaw left the band.

===Line-up changes and &quot;We Live&quot; (2003-2007)===
In August 2003, Oborn revealed Electric Wizard&#x27;s new line-up - drummer Greaves, second-guitarist Liz Buckingham (of 13 and Sourvein), and bassist Rob Al-Issa. This new lineup recorded &quot;We Live&quot; in 2004, just days after Buckingham began rehearsing with the band. As Oborn explained, the addition of Buckingham was crucial given the departure of his previous writing partner, Bagshaw:

The band toured England and Australia in support of the album and played at the 2005 Roadburn Festival. Greaves left the band in 2006 and was replaced by Shaun Rutter. The parting was not amicable, with Oborn remarking that &quot;We fell out big time with that loser. You know, I would piss on his grave.&quot;

===&quot;Witchcult Today&quot;, &quot;Black Masses&quot; and touring (2007-2012)===
In November 2007, the band released &quot;Witchcult Today&quot;. In 2008, bassist Rob Al-Issa left the band and was replaced by Tas Danazoglou. Three years later, in November 2010, Electric Wizard released their seventh album: &quot;Black Masses&quot;.

On 31 March 2012, Electric Wizard played in London at the HMV Forum, debuting its newest members, bassist Glenn Charman and drummer Simon Poole. A 7-inch EP titled &quot;Legalise Drugs and Murder&quot; was available for sale at the show. After the gig it was announced that it would be released worldwide and that more EPs would follow. On 1 October 2012, some copies of &quot;Terrorizer&quot; came with a cassette EP of &quot;Legalise Drugs and Murder&quot; which contained the two songs from the 7-inch along with two outtakes and two new songs. Electric Wizard also headlined the 2012 edition of Maryland Deathfest on 27 May, their first show in the United States in ten years.

===Label issues, &quot;Time to Die&quot; and &quot;Wizard Bloody Wizard&quot; (2013-present)===
They headlined the 2013 edition of the Roadburn Festival called the &#x27;Electric Acid Orgy,&#x27; which was also curated by Oborn.

Electric Wizard announced that their latest album, &quot;Time to Die&quot;, was to be released in 2014 on their own label Witchfinder Records via Spinefarm Records. It was recorded at Toerag Studios and Skyhammer Studios and mixed by Chris Fielding. The album was produced by guitarist Jus Oborn and released on 29 September 2014. The album is the first since 2002&#x27;s Let Us Prey to feature founding member Mark Greening on drums.

On 30 October 2014, Electric Wizard played their largest club show in the North of England at the 1500 capacity Ritz, Manchester, England.

On 16 December 2014, Electric Wizard announced they would embark on a US/Canada tour in 2015, their first US shows since 2012 and full tour of the US since 2002. Tickets to the tour were sold out within a month after going on sale. The band was set to release their latest album, &quot;Wizard Bloody Wizard&quot; in 2016, however this did not happen and in a September 2017 article Blabbermouth reported that the release date had been extended to 10 November 2017. The album was eventually released on 17 November 2017 Clayton Burgess left Electric Wizard in early 2018 to focus on his band Satan&#x27;s Satyrs. A single titled &quot; L.S.D. (Lucifers Satanic Daughter)&quot; was released in 2021, specifically for the film &quot;Lucifers Satanic Daughter&quot;. A band biography titled &quot;Come My Fanatics: A Journey Into The World Of Electric Wizard&quot; written by Dan Franklin was released on 22 June 2023.

<text>The electromagnetic dawn chorus is a phenomenon that occurs most often at or shortly after dawn local time. It is believed to be generated by a Doppler-shifted cyclotron interaction between anisotropic distributions of energetic (&gt; 40 keV) electrons and ambient background VLF noise. These energetic electrons are generally injected into the inner magnetosphere at the onset of the substorm expansion phase. Dawn choruses occur more frequently during magnetic storms.

This phenomenon also occurs during aurorae, when it is termed an auroral chorus.

With the proper radio equipment, dawn chorus can be converted to sounds that resemble, coincidentally, birds&#x27; dawn chorus.

<text>The Virgin Komi Forests (, ) is a natural UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Northern Ural Mountains of the Komi Republic, Russia. At 32,800 km2 it is the largest virgin forest in Europe.

==Geography and ecology==
The Virgin Komi Forests, located in the northeastern part of European Russia, encompasses approximately 3.28 million hectares, making them the largest expanse of virgin boreal forest in Europe. This vast area includes diverse landscapes such as tundra, alpine tundra, and boreal forests, situated west of the Ural Mountains in the Komi Republic.

The region&#x27;s flora is dominated by coniferous species, including Siberian spruce, Siberian fir, and Siberian larch. Deciduous trees like aspen and birch are also prevalent, contributing to the area&#x27;s rich biodiversity. The forests serve as a haven for rare species and contain one of Europe&#x27;s most valuable stores of genetic and biological diversity.

The fauna of the Virgin Komi Forests is equally diverse, supporting species such as reindeer, sable, European mink and mountain hare. The area is also home to various bird species, including the capercaillie and the Siberian jay. These ecosystems have been monitored and studied for over fifty years, providing valuable evidence of the natural processes affecting biodiversity in the taiga.

The Virgin Komi Forests are part of the Ural Mountains taiga ecoregion, characterized by a subarctic climate with long, cold winters and short, warm summers. This climate supports extensive peat bogs, rivers, and natural lakes, which play a crucial role in carbon sequestration and maintaining regional hydrology. The forests&#x27; pristine condition offers a unique opportunity to study natural boreal ecosystems without significant human interference.

In recognition of their ecological significance, the Virgin Komi Forests were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995, becoming Russia&#x27;s first natural site to receive this status. This designation includes two protected areas: the Pechora-Ilych Nature Reserve, established in 1930, and the Yugyd Va National Park, created in 1994. Together, these areas play a vital role in preserving the unique biodiversity and ecological processes of the region.

==Threats==
Despite the area&#x27;s recognition as a World Heritage site, attempts at extracting gold are being actively lobbied by the Head of the Republic and Komi&#x27;s Ministry of Nature.

<doc id="753410" wikidata="Q1493077" url="?curid=753410" title="Gamemaster (board game series)">
<text>The Gamemaster Series of board games consists of five war simulation games released by the game company Milton Bradley beginning in 1984. The games were not developed &quot;in-house&quot; by Milton Bradley, with each game initially published in limited runs by smaller game publishers in the early 1980s before their rights were acquired by Milton Bradley. Despite this, some modern reissues of these games refer to the Milton Bradley versions as the &quot;first edition&quot; of each game.

The original Milton Bradley &quot;Gamemaster Series&quot; included:
* &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; (1984)
* &quot;Conquest of the Empire&quot; (1984)
* &quot;Broadsides and Boarding Parties&quot; (1984)
* &quot;Fortress America&quot; (1986)
* &quot;Shogun&quot; (1986)

The first three games were designed by Larry Harris, while the last two were designed by Mike Gray, though neither were credited for their creations until their subsequent re-releases. Of these five, &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; was the most successful, spawning several revised versions, spinoffs, computer games, and a miniature game series, though &quot;Conquest of the Empire&quot;, &quot;Fortress America&quot;, and &quot;Shogun&quot; also saw some success. &quot;Broadsides and Boarding Parties&quot; was the most significant departure from the strategic focus of the other titles in the series, instead featuring a two-player duel between naval vessels.

The rights to four of the five games in the series are currently held by Hasbro. Though all five games were released under the Milton Bradley umbrella, by the 1990s &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; was the only game being continually updated. In 1999, Milton Bradley&#x27;s parent company, Hasbro, moved &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; to its Avalon Hill imprint, which specialized in board wargames. In 2004, Avalon Hill was made into a subsidiary of Wizards of the Coast, another Hasbro imprint that specialized in board games for a more dedicated &quot;gamer&quot; audience. &quot;Shogun&quot; is also currently published by Avalon Hill, but retitled &quot;Ikusa&quot;.

==Reissues==
Avalon Hill began publishing Axis &amp; Allies spin-off titles in 1999, focusing on the Europe and Pacific theaters as well as tactical recreations of specific battles. The 1984 edition of &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; remained the flagship product in the series until the 2004 release of &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: Revised&quot;, introducing to the main game some units and rules that originated in the spin-off titles. Axis &amp; Allies was later chosen as one of three board games re-released to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Avalon Hill in 2008, with that anniversary version of Axis &amp; Allies featuring board set-up options to start the game in 1941 instead of 1942. From that point onward, additional revised editions of the main game as well as spin-offs focusing on theaters or battles would include a starting year in the game&#x27;s title. In 2013, Avalon Hill published the first game outside of the series&#x27; World War II setting called &quot;Axis &amp; Allies: WWI 1914&quot;. Computer game adaptations of the original Axis &amp; Allies were released by Hasbro Interactive in 1998 and Atari in 2004. A miniature wargaming series was introduced by Avalon Hill in 2005.

&quot;Shogun&quot; was renamed twice to avoid confusion with other board games of the same name, first becoming &quot;Samurai Swords&quot; in 1995 while still carrying the branding of Milton Bradley&#x27;s Gamemaster Series and then becoming &quot;Ikusa&quot; in 2011 when reissued by Avalon Hill. &quot;Conquest of the Empire&quot; was re-released by Eagle Games in 2005 with updated rules. &quot;Fortress America&quot; was reissued with slightly revised cover art to remove Saddam Hussein while the game was still under the Gamemaster Series, and was later licensed to Fantasy Flight Games for a 2012 re-release with new and updated rules.

<doc id="753416" wikidata="Q11696608" url="?curid=753416" title="Elements of music">
<text>Music can be analysed by considering a variety of its elements, or parts (aspects, characteristics, features), individually or together. A commonly used list of the main elements includes pitch, timbre, texture, volume, duration, and form. The elements of music may be compared to the elements of art or design.

==Selection of elements==

According to Howard Gardner, there is little dispute about the principal constituent elements of music, though experts differ on their precise definitions. Harold Owen bases his list on the qualities of sound: pitch, timbre, intensity, and duration while John Castellini excludes duration. Gordon C. Bruner II follows the line of temporal-based deductions in association with musical composition, denoting music&#x27;s primary components as &quot;time, pitch, and texture.&quot; Most definitions of music include a reference to sound and sound perception can be divided into six cognitive processes. They are: pitch, duration, loudness, timbre, sonic texture and spatial location.

A &#x27;parameter&#x27; is any element that can be manipulated (composed) separately from other elements or focused on separately in an educational context. Leonard B. Meyer compares distinguishing parameters within a culture by their different constraints to distinguishing independent parameters within music, such as melody, harmony, timbre, &quot;etc.&quot; The first person to apply the term &quot;parameter&quot; to music may have been Joseph Schillinger, though its relative popularity may be due to Werner Meyer-Eppler. &quot;Gradation&quot; is gradual change within one parameter, or an overlapping of two blocks of sound.

Meyer lists melody, rhythm, timbre, harmony, &quot;and the like&quot; as principal elements of music, while Narmour lists melody, harmony, rhythm, dynamics, tessitura, timbre, tempo, meter, texture, &quot;and perhaps others&quot;. According to McClellan, two things should be considered, the quality or state of an element and its change over time. Alan P. Merriam proposed a theoretical research model that assumes three aspects are always present in musical activity: concept, behaviour, and sound. Virgil Thomson lists the &quot;raw materials&quot; of music in order of their supposed discovery: rhythm, melody, and harmony; including counterpoint and orchestration. Near the end of the twentieth century music scholarship began to give more attention to social and physical elements of music. For example: performance, social, gender, dance, and theatre.

==Definition of music==
Does the definition of music determine its aspects, or does the combination of certain aspects determine the definition of music? For example, intensional definitions list aspects or elements that make up their subject.

Some definitions refer to music as a score, or a composition: music can be read as well as heard, and a piece of music written but never played is a piece of music notwithstanding. According to Edward E. Gordon the process of reading music, at least for trained musicians, involves a process, called &quot;inner hearing&quot; or &quot;audiation&quot;, where the music is heard in the mind as if it were being played. This suggests that while sound is often considered a required aspect of music, it might not be.

Jean Molino points out that &quot;any element belonging to the total musical fact can be isolated, or taken as a strategic variable of musical production.&quot; Nattiez gives as examples Mauricio Kagel&#x27;s &quot;Con Voce&quot; [with voice], where a masked trio silently mimes playing instruments. In this example sound, a common element, is excluded, while gesture, a less common element, is given primacy. However Nattiez goes on to say that despite special cases where sound is not immediately obvious (because it is heard in the mind): &quot;sound is a minimal condition of the musical fact&quot;.

==Universal aspect==

There is disagreement about whether some aspects of music are universal, as well as whether the concept of music is universal. This debate often hinges on definitions. For instance, the fairly common assertion that &quot;tonality&quot; is a universal of all music may necessarily require an expansive definition of tonality. A pulse is sometimes taken as a universal, yet there exist solo vocal and instrumental genres with free and improvisational rhythm—no regular pulse—one example being the alap section of an Indian classical music performance. Harwood questions whether a &quot;cross-cultural musical universal&quot; may be found in the music or in the making of music, including performance, hearing, conception, and education.

One aspect that is important to bear in mind when examining multi-cultural associations is that an English-language word (i.e. the word &quot;music&quot;), not a universal concept, is the object of scrutiny. For this reason it is important to approach apparently equivalent words in other languages with caution. Based on the many disparate definitions that can be found just in English language dictionaries,) it seems there is no agreement on what the word &quot;music&quot; means in English, let alone determining a potentially equivalent word from another culture.

Kenneth Gourlay describes how, since different cultures include different elements in their definitions of music, dance, and related concepts, translation of the words for these activities may split or combine them, citing Nigerian musicologist Chinyere Nwachukwu&#x27;s definition of the Igbo term &quot;nkwa&quot; as an activity combining and/or requiring singing, playing musical instruments, and dancing. He then concludes that there exists &quot;nonuniversality of music and the universality of nonmusic&quot;.

==Other terms==
Other terms used to discuss particular pieces include:
* Note—an abstraction that refers to either a specific pitch or rhythm, or the written symbol
*Chord—a of notes heard as some sort of unit
*Chord progression—a succession of chords (simultaneity succession)

<text>DYNIX (&quot;DYNamic UnIX&quot;) was a Unix-like operating system developed by Sequent Computer Systems, based on 4.2BSD and modified to run on Intel-based symmetric multiprocessor hardware. The third major (Dynix 3.0) version was released May, 1987; by 1992 DYNIX was succeeded by DYNIX/ptx, which was based on UNIX System V.

IBM obtained rights to DYNIX/ptx in 1999, when it acquired Sequent for $810 million.

IBM&#x27;s subsequent Project Monterey was an attempt, circa 1999, &quot;to unify AIX with Sequent&#x27;s Dynix/ptx operating system and UnixWare.&quot; By 2001, however, &quot;the explosion in popularity of Linux ... prompted IBM to quietly ditch&quot; this.

<text>Canadian National Exhibition Stadium (commonly known as Exhibition Stadium or CNE Stadium and nicknamed The Ex) was a multi-purpose stadium in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on the grounds of Exhibition Place. Originally built for Canadian National Exhibition events, the stadium served as the home of the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL) from 1959 to 1988, the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1977 to 1989, and the Toronto Blizzard of the North American Soccer League (NASL) from 1979 to 1983. The stadium hosted the Grey Cup game 12 times over a 24-year period.

The grandstand (known as CNE Grandstand) was used extensively throughout the summer months for hosting concerts.

In 1999, the stadium was demolished and the site was used for parking until 2006. BMO Field was built on the site in 2007 roughly where the northern end of the covered grandstand once stood.

==History==

===CNE Grandstand===
Exhibition Stadium was the fourth stadium to be built on its site since 1879. When the original grandstand was lost due to a fire in 1906, it was quickly rebuilt. A second fire destroyed the stadium in April 1946, which led to the city constructing a covered north-side grandstand (known as CNE Grandstand) for  million in 1948. This part of the stadium&#x27;s structure stayed even as the stadium underwent various changes to its configuration over the years until its 1999 closure.

The new building seated , more than the previous grandstand. The building held two dining halls that could seat , a Exhibition Hall, electric plant and storage facilities. It was designed by firm Marani and Morris, and built by Piggott Construction. It had a large -wide stage and three radio rooms for broadcasting. The roof had a total of 300 floodlights and spotlights. The roof was specially designed to provide no place for pigeons to roost.

===Expansion for CFL football===
When the Toronto Argonauts moved from Varsity Stadium for the 1959 season, a smaller bleacher section was added along the south sideline. In this form the stadium seated 33,150.

The inaugural game at the renovated Exhibition Stadium was an exhibition interleague game between the hometown Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL) on August 5, 1959. The game was the first time an NFL team played in Toronto. It was also the first NFL–CFL exhibition match held since the establishment of the CFL in 1958, and marked the beginning of a three-year, four game exhibition series between the leagues.

When the 58th Grey Cup was played at the stadium in 1970, Calgary Stampeders coach Jim Duncan described the condition of the natural-grass surface as &quot;a disgrace.&quot; In January 1972, Metropolitan Toronto Council voted 15–9 to spend $625,000 to install artificial turf. The vote passed despite five councillors changing their vote to oppose the motion, because the cost had increased from a previous estimate of $400,000. Two months later, contracts totalling were approved to install the AstroTurf, with work to be completed by June, in time for the start of the Toronto Argonauts&#x27; 1972 season.

===Reconfiguration for baseball===

In 1974, in a bid to acquire a Major League Baseball team, the city voted to reconfigure the stadium to make it compatible for baseball, leading to the arrival of Major League Baseball in Toronto in 1977 in the form of the expansion Toronto Blue Jays after a failed attempt to lure the San Francisco Giants to the city.

Originally planned to cost million before growing to million ($ in dollars), the renovations, which were funded by the city and province, added seating opposite to the covered grandstand on the first base side and curving around to the third base side. Football capacity was increased from 33,150 before the renovations to 41,890 initially, then finally to 54,741 after work was completed. Although the stadium was expanded to accommodate baseball, the new seats were first used for football and allowed the 64th Grey Cup in November 1976 to be watched by a then-Grey Cup record crowd of 53,467. For baseball, the stadium originally seated 38,522; however, by the Blue Jays&#x27; second season this increased to 43,739, although only about 33,000 seats were usually made available (see below).

Even in its new, expanded form, Exhibition Stadium was problematic for hosting both baseball and football. Blue Jays&#x27; President Paul Beeston noted Exhibition Stadium &quot;wasn&#x27;t just the worst stadium in baseball, it was the worst stadium in sports.&quot;

====Baseball problems====

Exhibition Stadium was unusual among MLB ballparks in that it was a football-specific venue later renovated for baseball, whereas most U.S. venues hosting baseball and football were either ballparks where football was a secondary consideration or &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; facilities designed from the outset to host both sports. Like most multi-purpose stadiums, the lower boxes were set further back than comparable seats at baseball-only stadiums to accommodate the wider football field.

Moreover, at the time of the renovation a Canadian football field was almost 34% larger than an American football field. While in some respects the larger Canadian field arguably made retrofitting for baseball somewhat easier than was the case south of the border with previous examples such as Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum or future examples such as Mile High Stadium, it nevertheless left many of the seats down the right-field line and in right-centre were extremely far from the infield; they actually faced each other rather than the action. Some seats were as far as from home plate — the greatest such distance of any stadium ever used as a principal home field in the major leagues. The Blue Jays realized early on that these seats were too far from the field to be of any use during the regular season. As such, they were only sold when necessitated by demand during the 1985 and 1987 pennant races. 
As the original grandstand was used for the outfield seats, these were the cheapest seats but were the only ones which offered some protection from the elements; the Blue Jays were the only MLB team using a stadium with such a configuration.

====Football problems====
Because the full length of the third-base line had to be fitted between the north stand (the original grandstand) and the new south stand, they could no longer be parallel to each other. As a compromise between placements suitable for the two stands, the football field was rotated anticlockwise away from the north stand. Thus, the only seats as close to the field as before were those near the eastern end zone, and no seats had as good a view of the whole field as the centre-field seats before the conversion.

Although the Argonauts recorded average attendances of above 40,000 fans per game in the first few seasons following the stadium&#x27;s expansion, by the mid-1980s average attendance had fallen to fewer than 30,000 fans per game.

===Problems with the wind and cold===

Being situated relatively close to Lake Ontario, the stadium was often quite cold at the beginning and end of the baseball season (and the end of the football season). The first Blue Jays game played there on April 7, 1977, was the only major league game ever played with the field covered entirely by snow. The Blue Jays had to borrow Maple Leaf Gardens&#x27; Zamboni to clear off the field. Conditions at the stadium led to another odd incident that first year. On September 15, Baltimore Orioles manager Earl Weaver pulled his team off the field because -- in Weaver&#x27;s opinion -- he felt the bricks holding down the tarp near the bullpens along each baseline were a possible trip hazard for players trying to catch a ball in foul territory. This garnered a win by forfeit for the Jays – the only time in major league baseball history since 1914 that a team deliberately forfeited a game (as opposed to having an umpire call a forfeiture).

An April 30, 1984, game against the Texas Rangers was postponed due to winds. Before the game, Rangers manager Doug Rader named Jim Bibby as his starting pitcher, stating &quot;he&#x27;s the heaviest man in the world, and thus will be unaffected by the wind.&quot; However, Bibby would never make it to the mound. Two Rangers batters complained about dirt swirling in their eyes, and Blue Jays starting pitcher Jim Clancy was blown off balance several times. The umpires stopped the game after only six pitches. After a 30-minute delay, the game was called off.

The stadium also occasionally had problems with fog, once causing a bizarre inside-the-park home run for Kelly Gruber in 1986, when an otherwise routine pop up was lost by the outfielders in the thick fog.

===As a popular feeding ground for seagulls===
Due to its position next to the lake, and the food disposed by baseball and football fans, the stadium was a popular feeding ground for seagulls. New York Yankees outfielder Dave Winfield was arrested on August 4, 1983, for killing a seagull with a baseball. Winfield had just finished his warm-up exercises in the 5th inning and threw a ball to the ball boy, striking a seagull in the head. The seagull died, and some claimed that Winfield hit the bird on purpose, which prompted Yankees manager Billy Martin to state &quot;They wouldn&#x27;t say that if they&#x27;d seen the throws he&#x27;d been making all year. It&#x27;s the first time he&#x27;s hit the cutoff man&quot;. The charges were later dropped. Winfield would later play for the Blue Jays, winning a World Series with the club in 1992.

===70th Grey Cup and replacement===
Exhibition Stadium&#x27;s fate was sealed during the 70th Grey Cup in 1982, popularly known as &quot;the Rain Bowl&quot; because it was played in a driving rainstorm that left most of the crowd drenched. Many of the seats were completely exposed to the elements, forcing thousands of fans to watch the game in the concession section. To make matters worse, the washrooms overflowed. In attendance that day was then-Ontario Premier Bill Davis, and the poor conditions were seen by over 7.862 million television viewers in Canada (at the time the largest TV audience ever in Canada). The following day, at a rally at Toronto City Hall, tens of thousands of people who were there to see the Toronto Argonauts began to chant, &quot;We want a dome! We want a dome!&quot; So too did others who began to discuss the possibility of an all-purpose, all-weather stadium.

Seven months later, in June 1983, Premier Davis formally announced that a three-person committee would look into the feasibility of building a domed stadium at Exhibition Place. The committee consisted of Paul Godfrey, Larry Grossman and former Ontario Hydro chairman Hugh Macaulay. That same year, the city also studied a number of potential sites for the new domed stadium, and in April 1984, CN agreed to donate of land near the CN Tower for the stadium; groundbreaking began in October 1986, and the stadium, which would take on the name SkyDome (now Rogers Centre), opened in June 1989.

====Life following the opening of SkyDome and demolition====

Exhibition Stadium mostly stayed inactive over the decade following the opening of SkyDome (being used sometimes as a racetrack or a parking lot), except for the occasional concert or minor sporting event. The World Wrestling Federation (now WWE), needing a new venue after a decision to discontinue events at Maple Leaf Gardens in 1995, held one card at the stadium on August 24, 1996, for a crowd of 21,211. The main event was Shawn Michaels vs. Goldust in a ladder match. A series of CASCAR races were held at the track during the 1990s, with the stadium being reconfigured for such races.

The stadium was demolished in 1999 and the site is now the location of BMO Field and a parking lot. A few chairs from the stadium can be found on the southeast corner just north of the bridge to Ontario Place&#x27;s main entrance. As is common with stadium demolitions, a number of the remaining seats were sold to fans and collectors. The original locations of all bases and home plate are marked in the parking lot south of BMO Field.

====The &quot;Mistake by the Lake&quot;====
Although not widely used while the stadium was in operation (given the well known references to Cleveland&#x27;s Municipal Stadium), the term &quot;Mistake by the Lake&quot; has been used more recently in reflection by Toronto media to refer to the now-demolished venue.

==New stadium==

On October 26, 2005, the City of Toronto approved a million proposal to build a 20,000-seat stadium near where the old stadium once was. The governments of Canada and Ontario funded million, with the city paying million, and Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment paying the rest, including any runoff costs. Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment was awarded a Major League Soccer expansion team, Toronto FC, that debuted on April 28, 2007, at the stadium.

BMO Field was initially built as a soccer-specific stadium with field dimensions that were too small to accommodate a Canadian football field and was operated as such until 2015 when MLSE owners Larry Tanenbaum and Bell Canada agreed to purchase the Toronto Argonauts. As part of the agreement, BMO Field was renovated to allow the Argonauts to move back to the site in time for the 2016 CFL season; the project involved the addition of new seats and a roof as well as lengthening the playing field by using retractable seating. The stadium hosted the 104th Grey Cup, MLS Cup 2016, and the outdoor NHL Centennial Classic game within a 36-day period in late 2016. BMO Field also hosted the MLS Cup in 2010 and 2017, along with the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup. The stadium is planned to host matches at the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

==Chevrolet Beach Volleyball Centre==

For the 2015 Pan American Games and Parapan American Games, the old stadium footprint (parking lot) became the Chevrolet Beach Volleyball Centre. The temporary venue had bleachers and a playing area filled with 3,000 metric tonnes of sand. After the Pan American Games, the venue was torn down to allow for setup of rides and restore parking spaces for the 2015 Canadian National Exhibition opening on August 21 of the same year.

==Concerts and events==
Many rock concerts were also held at the stadium, both the grandstand and the whole stadium were used for popular rock and pop acts such as Pink Floyd, The Who, U2, David Bowie, Chicago, New Order, Depeche Mode, Iron Maiden, Rush, Van Halen, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Liza Minnelli, Kim Mitchell, Bruce Springsteen, Bette Midler, INXS, Bon Jovi, AC/DC, Elton John, Whitney Houston and Janis Joplin, New Kids On The Block.

*On July 18, 1958, Richard Petty made the first of 1,184 starts in NASCAR Grand National Series competition in a race at the grandstand, entitled the 1958 Jim Mideon 500. Today, the roads of the Exhibition Place are used for the INDYCAR Honda Indy Toronto and since 2010 has hosted the NASCAR Pinty&#x27;s Series.
*The stadium was featured on a Season 4 &quot;Route 66&quot; episode titled &quot;A Long Way from St. Louie&quot; which first aired on December 6, 1963. While on a helicopter tour over downtown Toronto, Tod Stiles and Linc Case (Martin Milner and Glenn Corbett, respectively) spot a quintet of girl musicians (two were played by Lynda Day and Jessica Walter), who were stranded in the city, sleeping on the benches in the covered north grandstand.
*1967 saw the Canadian Armed Forces Tattoo 1967 perform eight shows at the stadium to standing ovations every night. So popular with crowds at the stadium of 30,000 most nights, the 89-year-old never on Sunday taboo had to be waived to permit the Tattoo to put on a Sunday, September 3 performance to accommodate the extraordinary demand for tickets. John Holden, a CNE official stated, &quot;It was breathtaking. You just can&#x27;t compare it with the like of anything that has come before it.&quot; CNE General Manager Bert Powell stated, &quot;We&#x27;ve never had anything like it — fabulous and fantastic. My phone is never quiet. I&#x27;m even getting professional critics and entertainers begging for tickets, and that&#x27;s the ultimate tribute.&quot;

<doc id="753426" wikidata="Q1126593" url="?curid=753426" title="Conquest of the Empire">
<text>Conquest of the Empire is a military strategy board game set in the Roman Empire after the death of Marcus Aurelius, with 2 to 6 players pitting their armies against each other in an attempt to become the ruler of Rome. The game was created in 1982 by Larry Harris and published by The Citadel under the title VI Caesars. Harris revised the game for Milton Bradley in 1984 to be reissued under the title &quot;Conquest of the Empire&quot; as part of the Gamemaster series. The game was re-released in the summer of 2005 by Eagle Games, redesigned by Glenn Drover. The gameplay in &quot;Conquest of the Empire&quot; shares similarities to &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot;, another Larry Harris project within the same series.

==Milton Bradley version==
Players begin with a Caesar, six generals, a small number of combat units (4 infantry), and a home province. There are six home provinces: Hispania, Italia, Macedonia, Numidia, Egypt, and Galatia—each of which contains a fortified city. The selection of home provinces available to the players is determined by how many are playing. The goal is to capture the other Caesars.

All units (except galleys) must be grouped in a legion containing any number of up to seven units. Each legion must be under the control of a general or Caesar to move, although a legion may be stationed without a commander in a province if it contains a city. All reinforcements are placed in the home province, and cannot be moved to the battlefronts until the beginning of the following turn.

===Combat Units===
*Galleys—a naval unit required for a legion to cross the Mediterranean or other bodies of water. Only one general per trireme may be on board. Reinforcement triremes are placed on the coast of the home province, and a player may own a maximum of six under the home color at any given time. Embarking or disembarking from a coast requires one troop movement. If there are some units inside the trireme, must be notified to the rest of the players.
* A Caesar or general may travel unaccompanied for up to two movements in provinces under the player&#x27;s control. He does not have any combat strength of his own and may be captured if the province is invaded by another player.
*Cavalry have different strength characteristics when involved in a naval battle.

===Gameplay===
Players take turns, using their legions to conquer other provinces, for which they exact a tribute at the end of their turn (measured in talents), which pays for their military expenditures. In addition to combat units, a player may decide to build a city on the province, which provides additional tribute, and fortifications for the city, which provides a combat advantage in battle. Players may only collect tribute when in control of their home province. In addition, a talent bonus is awarded for the capture of another player&#x27;s home province or Caesar.

Roads can be automatically built between cities of neighboring provinces under a player&#x27;s control. This allows a legion to travel to any part of the road network in only one movement. A city may also be destroyed, along with its roads and any fortifications, to prevent an enemy from collecting its tribute and extending a road network.

Tributes are measured with a player&#x27;s marker placed along the tribute scale at the bottom of the game map. When any player reaches a level of 100 talents, single inflation is triggered, permanently doubling the cost of items from their original cost for all players for the rest of the game, starting with the turn of the next player. At the 200 talent level, inflation (called double inflation this time) is triggered once again, permanently making the cost of all items triple the original cost starting with the next player&#x27;s turn.

Players can undertake any number of actions during their turn, provided they can make them by not exceeding a legion&#x27;s ability to move. Captured leaders may be held prisoner in a player&#x27;s home province (or with Caesar if the home province has been captured) for ransom or exchange, or executed and permanently removed from the board.

When a player captures an opposing Caesar, that opponent loses the game, and all remaining forces and territories are placed under the control of the conquering player. The conquering player may not build new triremes using the opponent&#x27;s color or in the opponent&#x27;s home province but may use existing triremes as his own, as well as use the captured generals to lead a legion. A player wins the game when the last opposing Caesar has been captured.

===Combat advantage and battle===
A combat advantage is given to the player who has more catapults in the battle, equal to the difference between the number of catapults of the opposing forces. A fortified city gives the defending legions an additional advantage of +1 for this calculation, and the fortifications/catapults cannot attack. When the player with the combat advantage attacks, the advantage is added to their die roll to determine if that roll eliminates a combat unit.

To battle, starting with the attacker, each player alternates turns in which they declare an opposing piece to attack and roll a die. If the number rolled (including any combat advantage) equals or exceeds the attacked piece&#x27;s strength, the attacked piece is removed from the board. An attacker may attack with more than one legion at a time, and from more than one direction. Only the attacking forces have the option of retreating to their original position(s) (with each general having their option). If a force has been destroyed, the losing general(s) is/are captured by the ultimate winner of the battle, and the loser&#x27;s triremes destroyed, although the die must be rolled for this to occur in a naval battle, and a trireme can only be attacked after all legions have been destroyed.

Since an overwhelming number of catapults can effectively increase their advantage by eliminating the opposing catapults, experienced game players feel that the catapult piece is too powerful, hurting the game&#x27;s playability.

==Reception==
Allen Varney reviewed the 1984 Milton Bradley version of &quot;Conquest of the Empire&quot; in &quot;Space Gamer&quot; No. 72. Varney commented &quot;&quot;Conquest of the Empire&quot; is a superb contest of skill - not strong on simulation, but very good at capturing the grandeur that was Rome.&quot;

==Reviews==
*&quot;Games&quot; #61
*1985 Games 100

==2005 version==
The 2005 re-release featured a tweaked version of the original rules as &quot;Conquest of the Empire: Classic&quot;. In this version, the combat system was changed. Dice now featured images on all sides that represented your units. If you&#x27;d roll an infantry, an infantry unit from your army would make a hit. Catapults are now more balanced.

==Conquest of the Empire II==

The 2005 re-release contains two rulesets and is therefore in a sense &#x27;two games in one&#x27;. Besides the classic rules, there is also a new ruleset heavily inspired by another Eagle game, &quot;Struggle of Empires&quot; by Martin Wallace, and represents a more &#x27;modern&#x27; type of board game. Players now fight for influence in key provinces and troops are not limited in their area movement anymore. New concepts include forced alliances, chaos points, action cards, and senate votes.

<doc id="753436" wikidata="Q12074763" url="?curid=753436" title="QT interval">
<text>The QT interval is a measurement made on an electrocardiogram used to assess some of the electrical properties of the heart. It is calculated as the time from the start of the Q wave to the end of the T wave, and approximates to the time taken from when the cardiac ventricles start to contract to when they finish relaxing. An abnormally long or abnormally short QT interval is associated with an increased risk of developing abnormal heart rhythms and sudden cardiac death. Abnormalities in the QT interval can be caused by genetic conditions such as long QT syndrome, by certain medications such as fluconazole, sotalol or pitolisant, by disturbances in the concentrations of certain salts within the blood such as hypokalaemia, or by hormonal imbalances such as hypothyroidism.

==Measurement==

The QT interval is most commonly measured in lead II for evaluation of serial ECGs, with leads I and V5 being comparable alternatives to lead II. Leads III, aVL and V1 are generally avoided for measurement of QT interval. The accurate measurement of the QT interval is subjective because the end of the T wave is not always clearly defined and usually merges gradually with the baseline. QT interval in an ECG complex can be measured manually by different methods, such as the threshold method, in which the end of the T wave is determined by the point at which the component of the T wave merges with the isoelectric baseline, or the tangent method, in which the end of the T wave is determined by the intersection of a tangent line extrapolated from the T wave at the point of maximum downslope to the isoelectric baseline.

With the increased availability of digital ECGs with simultaneous 12-channel recording, QT measurement may also be done by the &#x27;superimposed median beat&#x27; method. In the superimposed median beat method, a median ECG complex is constructed for each of the 12 leads. The 12 median beats are superimposed on each other and the QT interval is measured either from the earliest onset of the Q wave to the latest offset of the T wave or from the point of maximum convergence for the Q wave onset to the T wave offset.

==Correction for heart rate==
The QT interval changes in response to the heart rate - as heart rate increase the QT interval shortens. These changes make it harder to compare QT intervals measured at different heart rates. To account for this, and thereby improve the reliability of QT measurement, the QT interval can be corrected for heart rate (QTc) using a variety of mathematical formulae, a process often performed automatically by modern ECG recorders.

===Bazett&#x27;s formula===
The most commonly used QT correction formula is the &quot;Bazett&#x27;s formula&quot;, named after physiologist Henry Cuthbert Bazett (1885–1950), calculating the heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTcB).

Bazett&#x27;s formula is based on observations from a study in 1920. 
Bazett&#x27;s formula is often given in a form that returns QTc in dimensionally suspect units, square root of seconds. The dimensionally correct form of Bazett&#x27;s formula is:

: formula_1

where QTcB is the QT interval corrected for heart rate, and RR is the interval from the onset of one QRS complex to the onset of the next QRS complex. This dimensionally correct formula returns the QTc in the same units as QT, generally milliseconds.

In some popular forms of this formula, it is assumed that QT is measured in milliseconds and that RR is measured in seconds, often derived from the heart rate (HR) as 60/HR. Therefore, the result will be given in seconds per square root of milliseconds. However, reporting QTc using this formula creates a &quot;requirement regarding the units in which the original QT and RR are measured.&quot;

In either form, Bazett&#x27;s non-linear QT correction formula is generally not considered accurate, as it over-corrects at high heart rates and under-corrects at low heart rates. Bazett&#x27;s correction formula is one of the most suitable QT correction formulae for neonates.

===Fridericia&#x27;s formula===
Fridericia had proposed an alternative correction formula (QTcF) using the cube-root of RR.

: formula_2

===Sagie&#x27;s formula===
The Framingham correction, also called as Sagie&#x27;s formula based on the Framingham Heart Study, which used long-term cohort data of over 5,000 subjects, is considered a better method.

: formula_3

Again, here &quot;QT&quot; and &quot;QTlc&quot; are in milliseconds and &quot;RR&quot; is measured in seconds.

===Comparison of corrections===
A retrospective study suggests that Fridericia&#x27;s method and the Framingham method may produce results most useful for stratifying the 30-day and 1-year risks of mortality.
Definitions of normal QTc vary from being equal to or less than 0.40 s (≤ 400 ms), 0.41 s (≤ 410 ms), 0.42 s (≤ 420 ms) or 0.44 s (≤ 440 ms). For risk of sudden cardiac death, &quot;borderline QTc&quot; in males is 431–450 ms; and, in females, 451–470 ms. An &quot;abnormal&quot; QTc in males is a QTc above 450 ms; and, in females, above 470 ms.

If there is not a very high or low heart rate, the upper limits of QT can roughly be estimated by taking QT = QTc at a heart rate of 60 beats per minute (bpm), and subtracting 0.02 s from QT for every 10 bpm increase in heart rate. For example, taking normal QTc ≤ 0.42 s, QT would be expected to be 0.42 s or less at a heart rate of 60 bpm. For a heart rate of 70 bpm, QT would roughly be expected to be equal to or below 0.40 s. Likewise, for 80 bpm, QT would roughly be expected to be equal to or below 0.38 s.

==Abnormal intervals==
Prolonged QTc causes premature action potentials during the late phases of depolarization. This increases the risk of developing ventricular arrhythmias, including fatal ventricular fibrillation. Higher rates of prolonged QTc are seen in females, older patients, high systolic blood pressure or heart rate, and short stature. Prolonged QTc is also associated with ECG findings called Torsades de Pointes, which are known to degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, associated with higher mortality rates. There are many causes of prolonged QT intervals, acquired causes being more common than genetic.

===Genetic causes===

An abnormally prolonged QT interval could be due to long QT syndrome, whereas an abnormally shortened QT interval could be due to short QT syndrome.

The QTc length is associated with variations in the NOS1AP gene. The autosomal recessive syndrome of Jervell and Lange-Nielsen is characterized by a prolonged QTc interval in conjunction with sensorineural hearing loss.

===Due to adverse drug reactions===

Prolongation of the QT interval may be due to an adverse drug reaction.

Antipsychotics (especially first generation/&quot;typical&quot;)

* haloperidol
* thioridazine
* mesoridazine
* chlorpromazine 
* sertindole

DMARDs and antimalarial drugs

* hydroxychloroquine
* chloroquine
* quinine

Antibiotics

* macrolides
* fluoroquinolones

Other drugs

* methadone
* vemurafenib
* pitolisant
* fluconazole

Some second-generation antihistamines, such as astemizole, have this effect. The mechanism of action of certain antiarrhythmic drugs, like amiodarone or sotalol, involve intentional pharmacological QT prolongation. In addition, high blood alcohol concentrations prolong the QT interval. A possible interaction between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and thiazide diuretics is associated with QT prolongation.

===Due to pathological conditions===
Hypothyroidism, a condition of low function of the thyroid gland, can cause QT prolongation at the electrocardiogram. Acute hypocalcemia causes prolongation of the QT interval, which may lead to ventricular dysrhythmias.

A shortened QT can be associated with hypercalcemia.

===Use in drug approval studies===
Since 2005, the FDA and European regulators have required that nearly all new molecular entities be evaluated in a Thorough QT (TQT) or similar study to determine a drug&#x27;s effect on the QT interval. The TQT study serves to assess the potential arrhythmia liability of a drug. Traditionally, the QT interval had been evaluated by having an individual human reader measure approximately nine cardiac beats per clinical timepoint. However, a substantial portion of drug approvals after 2010 have incorporated a partially automated approach, blending automated software algorithms with expert human readers reviewing a portion of the cardiac beats, to enable the assessment of significantly more beats in order to improve precision and reduce cost. In 2014, an industrywide consortium consisting of the FDA, iCardiac Technologies and other organizations released the results of a seminal study indicating how waivers from TQT studies can be obtained by the assessment of early phase data. As the pharmaceutical industry has gained experience in performing TQT studies, it has also become evident that traditional QT correction formulas such as QTcF, QTcB, and QTcLC may not always be suitable for evaluation of drugs impacting autonomic tone.

===As a predictor of mortality===
Electrocardiography is a safe and noninvasive tool that can be used to identify those with a higher risk of mortality. In the general population, there has been no consistent evidence that prolonged QTc interval in isolation is associated with an increase in mortality from cardiovascular disease. However, several studies have examined prolonged QT interval as a predictor of mortality for diseased subsets of the population.

===Rheumatoid arthritis===
Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common inflammatory arthritis. Studies have linked rheumatoid arthritis with increased death from cardiovascular disease.
In a 2014 study, Panoulas et al. found a 50 ms increase in QTc interval increased the odds of all-cause mortality by 2.17 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients with the highest QTc interval (&gt; 424 ms) had higher mortality than those with a lower QTc interval. The association was lost when calculations were adjusted for C-reactive protein levels. The researchers proposed that inflammation prolonged the QTc interval and created arrhythmias that were associated with higher mortality rates. However, the mechanism by which C-reactive protein is associated with the QTc interval is still not understood.

===Type 1 diabetes===
Compared to the general population, type 1 diabetes may increase the risk of mortality, due largely to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Almost half of patients with type 1 diabetes have a prolonged QTc interval (&gt; 440 ms). Diabetes with a prolonged QTc interval was associated with a 29% mortality over 10 years in comparison to 19% with a normal QTc interval. Anti-hypertensive drugs increased the QTc interval, but were not an independent predictor of mortality.

===Type 2 diabetes===
QT interval dispersion (QTd) is the maximum QT interval minus the minimum QT interval, and is linked with ventricular repolarization. A QTd over 80 ms is considered abnormally prolonged. Increased QTd is associated with mortality in type 2 diabetes. 
QTd is a better predictor of cardiovascular death than QTc, which was unassociated with mortality in type 2 diabetes. QTd higher than 80 ms had a relative risk of 1.26 of dying from cardiovascular disease compared to a normal QTd.

<text>Broadsides and Boarding Parties is a board game published by Milton Bradley in 1984 as part of their Gamemaster series. It was the 3rd in the series of games that are all designed by Larry Harris. It is the only game of that series to feature a two player game (all of the games in the Gamemaster series were for two or more players), &quot;Broadsides and Boarding Parties&quot; is a duel between a Spanish galleon and a pirate ship. Players take turns moving their ship and firing at the other ship to sink her. If the ships collide then players may take boarding parties onto the other ship to try to win.

The original version of this game, published by The Citadel in 1982, used a paper map and cardboard pieces and did not have the plastic ships, cannons, and other playing pieces. When Hasbro bought the publishing rights, they added these components to bring the physical components in line with the other games in the series. However, many players found that the large ship models were difficult to disassemble, making the storage of this game awkward.

A more serious problem was that the gameplay was not considered up to the level of the other games in the series. There was relatively little strategy and more luck involved than the other games. As part of a series, &quot;Broadsides and Boarding Parties&quot; was unfavorably compared to the other games and was less popular.

&quot;Broadsides and Boarding Parties&quot; was discontinued several years after its introduction.

==Reception==
Allen Varney reviewed the 1984 Milton Bradley version of &quot;Broadsides &amp; Boarding Parties&quot; in &quot;Space Gamer&quot; No. 72. Varney commented that &quot;&quot;Broadsides &amp; Boarding Parties&quot; is not worth the money. The components can&#x27;t save the weak design. It might be okay for helping two players kill 20 minutes while waiting to play &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot;, but otherwise there&#x27;s not much value here.&quot;

<text>Giblets is a culinary term for the edible offal of a fowl, typically including the heart, gizzard, liver, and other organs.

A whole bird from a butcher is often packaged with the giblets, sometimes sealed in a bag within the body cavity. The neck is often included with the giblets; in the West it is usually separated from the body during butchering.

== History ==
In his 19th century culinary dictionary, Alexander Dumas defines giblets as &quot;the comb and kidneys of the rooster, the wing tips of hens, the spinal marrow, gizzard, and neck of the turkey, calves&#x27; sweetbreads and brains&quot;. They can be made as a standalone dish with beef marrow bouillon, mushrooms, artichoke, truffles (when in season) and celery. This giblet dish can be served as a casserole with rice, or used as a filling for the pastry vol-au-vent. This was considered daily fare, and not intended for special occasions.

== Culture ==
There are a number of recipes that use giblets. If a bird is to be stuffed, the giblets are traditionally chopped and added to the stuffing; however, the USDA recommends cooking giblets separately from the rest of the bird. If not, they can be used for other purposes, such as &quot;giblet pie&quot; or, a Southern U.S. favorite, giblet gravy. With the exception of giblet gravy, the liver is not usually included in these recipes, as its strong flavor tends to overpower other ingredients. It may be used in liver-specific recipes, such as pâté or yakitori. Giblets can also be used to make alicot, a French stew.

In Turkish cuisine, iç pilav is a traditional pilaf dish, made with rice, chicken liver, nuts, and spices. Jerusalem mixed grill is an Israeli delicacy made with giblets, usually eaten with pita bread.

In Gorkha cuisine, giblets are cooked with chili pepper and tomato and relished as a side dish or appetizer known as &quot;karchi marchi&quot;.

Giblets are common in Taiwanese cuisine.

Most poultry, especially those sold in supermarkets, is not sold with the giblets included. Giblets can be bought separately from a butcher, but the demand for human consumption is low in most Western countries, so they are more often sold to pet food manufacturers.

<text>A pork pie hat is one of several different styles of hat that have been worn since the mid-19th century. The pork pie hat gained further popularity in the 20th century, being worn by famous actors and musicians. This style of hat features a flat crown that resembles a traditional pork pie, thus earning its name.

== The pork pie hat in 19th-century fashion ==

The origins of the pork pie hat in Western fashion lay in the 1860s. Initially an item of women’s wear, this accessory was identifiable through its shape, particularly the narrow brim which distinctively curled round towards the crown of the hat, which was flat, and usually made from straw or velvet in this period. The pork pie hat was small, and would be worn towards the front of the head to account for popular hairstyles of the era. The fashion for pork pie hats soon spread, also becoming a feature of menswear. As a men’s accessory, the pork pie was larger, and could be fashioned with decorative ribbons to the back of the hat.

==Buster Keaton and the 1920s==
The pork pie began to gain further popularity in Britain as a man&#x27;s hat not long after the turn of the 20th century in the fashion style of the &quot;,&quot; with famous entertainers sporting this style regularly. Silent film actor Buster Keaton converted fedoras into straw boater-like felt pork pies by stiffening their brims with a dried sugar-water solution. This kind of pork pie had a very flat top and similar short flat brim.

==1930s and 1940s==
The heyday of the pork pie hat occurred during the Great Depression, following the straw boater era that peaked in the Roaring Twenties. In this incarnation, the pork pie regained its snap brim and increased slightly in height. Its dished crown became known among hatmakers as &quot;telescopic crowns&quot; or &quot;tight telescopes&quot; because when worn the top could be made to pop up slightly. Furthermore, as stated in a newspaper clipping from the mid-1930s: &quot;The true pork pie hat is so made that it cannot be worn successfully except when telescoped.&quot; The same clipping refers to the hat also as &quot;the bi crowned&quot;. Among famous wearers of the pork pie during this era are Frank Lloyd Wright, whose pork pie hat had a very wide brim and rather tall crown. Lester Young, whose career as a jazz saxophonist spanned from the mid-1920s to the late 1950s, regularly wore a pork pie hat during his performances, and after his death Charles Mingus composed a musical elegy in Young&#x27;s honor entitled &quot;Goodbye Pork Pie Hat&quot;. Young&#x27;s pork pie had a broader brim than seen in earlier styles but retained the definitive round, flat, creased crown.
A porkpie hat was a trademark of physicist Robert Oppenheimer, scientific director of the World WarII project that developed the atomic bomb.

In African American culture in the 1940s the pork pie—flashy, feathered, color-coordinated—became associated with the zoot suit. By 1944 the hat was even prevalent in New Guinea.

==Post-1950s==

After the end of World War II the pork pie&#x27;s broad popularity declined somewhat, though as a result of the zoot suit connection it continued its association with African American music culture, particularly jazz, blues, and ska. In television between 1951 and 1955, Art Carney frequently wore one in his characterization of Ed Norton in &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, and in Puerto Rico the actor Joaquín Monserrat, known as &quot;Pacheco&quot;, was the host of many children&#x27;s 1950s TV shows and was known for his straw pork pie hat and bow tie—in this incarnation, the pork pie returned to its Buster Keaton style with rigidly flat brim and extremely low flat crown.

In the 1960s in Jamaica, the &quot;rude boy&quot; subculture popularized the pork-pie, as well as hats resembling tall trilby styles. Jamaican diaspora brought the pork pie hat back into style in the United Kingdom through the connecting of youth cultures. When migration to the United Kingdom increased following the end of the Second World War and government calls for post-war reconstruction (see Windrush generation, British Nationality Act), shared musical and style interests thereby influenced the appearance of garments such as the pork pie hat in the emergent youth mod and rave subculture.

The porkpie hat enjoyed a slight resurgence in exposure and popularity after Gene Hackman&#x27;s character Jimmy &quot;Popeye&quot; Doyle wore one in the 1971 film &quot;The French Connection&quot;. Doyle was based on real-life policeman Eddie Egan, who played the captain in the film, and his exploits. Egan was famous all his life for wearing a pork pie hat. At about the same time, Robert De Niro wore a pork pie hat in the 1973 film &quot;Mean Streets&quot; (the same hat he wore when he auditioned for the film).

Further, the Two-Tone Ska revival of the 1970s also contributed to the revival of the pork pie hat in youth culture and fashion in the United Kingdom, where black and white tailored garments were coupled with this style of hat, as worn by members of bands The Specials and The Selecter, for example.

==Contemporary associations==
A frequent wearer of pork pie hats is Panamanian salsa singer and composer Ruben Blades. In the early 21st century, the wearing of a pork pie hat retained some of its 1930s and &#x27;40s associations. Fashion writer Glenn O&#x27;Brien says:

Bryan Cranston&#x27;s character Walter White wears a pork pie hat in the AMC series &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; when he appears as his alter ego &quot;Heisenberg&quot;, whose persona is associated with the hat. Sony Pictures Television donated &quot;Heisenberg&#x27;s&quot; hat to the Smithsonian Institution.

<doc id="753459" wikidata="Q2219088" url="?curid=753459" title="Shogun (1986 board game)">
<text>Shogun is a board wargame set in feudal Japan, first released in 1986 by game maker Milton Bradley.

==Publication history==
&quot;Shogun&quot;, designed by Michael Gray, was first released in 1986 by Milton Bradley as part of their Gamemaster series. It was renamed to Samurai Swords in its first re-release (1995) to disambiguate it from other games with the same name (in particular, &quot;James Clavell&#x27;s Shogun&quot;, a wargame with a similar theme, released in 1983), and renamed again to Ikusa in its 2011 re-release under Hasbro&#x27;s Avalon Hill banner.

==Gameplay==
Set in feudal Japan, two to five players take control of a fictional warlord and pit their armies against one another in hopes of winning the title Shogun.

Each player controls a number of daimyō, or generals, who command an army. Other forces on the board represent militia and garrisons. Players have the option of hiring ronin (mercenaries). There is a ninja, principally used as an assassin against enemy daimyō. Units include samurai swordsmen and bowmen, and ashigaru spearmen and gunners. 

Income, called koku, is derived from control of territories. Players attempt to destroy their rivals in battle and seize their territories. Some interesting features include the orchestration of armies in battle, the emphasis on generals (who gain levels, much like roleplaying game characters), and the unpredictable element of ronin placement.

The game uses six twelve-sided dice. The trays for units are designed to resemble Japanese fortresses, and each player receives a small katana (to display the order in which players take their turns).

==Reception==
&quot;Shogun&quot; was awarded the Origins Award for &quot;Best Pre-20th Century Boardgame of 1987&quot; and &quot;Best Graphic Presentation of a Boardgame of 1987&quot;.

David M. Ewalt of Forbes commented on the 2011 release of Ikusa: &quot;The game formerly known as Samurai Swords (and before that as Shogun) gets another makeover. Still the same strategy classic where players compete to rule feudal Japan, but the box, board and pieces have been updated. Not cheap, but the redesign looks great and the game’s as fun as ever.&quot;

In a review of the game as &quot;Ikusa&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, Scott Taylor said &quot;Truly, it&#x27;s a fantastic game, and that&#x27;s the reason it&#x27;s been around so long and still maintains viability. As for the newest version, I&#x27;d say it carries much the same properties as its predecessors, with beautifully updated art by Steve Argyle and Gonzalo Flores. A single knock on this version is the change from hard plastic play pieces to soft plastic, some of the bases becoming warped in packaging. Still, I&#x27;d give &quot;Ikusa&quot; four stars out of five and highly recommend picking it up for anyone who loves strategic warfare games.&quot;

<text>Dirck Jaspersz. van Baburen ( – 21 February 1624) was a Dutch painter and one of the Utrecht Caravaggisti.

==Biography==
Dirck van Baburen was probably born in Wijk bij Duurstede, but his family moved to Utrecht when he was still young. He was also known as Teodoer van Baburen and Theodor Baburen. The earliest reference to the artist is in the 1611 records of the Utrecht Guild of St. Luke as a pupil of Paulus Moreelse. Sometime between 1612 and 1615, he travelled to Rome. There, he collaborated with fellow countryman David de Haen and befriended the close follower of Caravaggio, Bartolomeo Manfredi. Baburen also came to the attention of the art collectors and patrons Vincenzo Giustiniani and cardinal Scipione Borghese, and possibly under their influence he received the commission to paint the altarpiece of the &quot;Entombment&quot; for the chapel of the Pietà in San Pietro in Montorio around 1617. Baburen was one of the earliest artists to belong to the group of Dutch-speaking artists active in Rome in the seventeenth-century known as the &quot;Bentvueghels&quot; (&quot;Birds of a Feather&quot;); his nickname was &quot;Biervlieg&quot; (&quot;Beer Fly&quot;, or one who drinks a lot).

In late 1620, Baburen returned to Utrecht, where he began painting genre scenes. Until his death in 1624 the painter, along with Hendrick ter Brugghen and Gerard van Honthorst, helped establish the stylistic and thematic innovations now known as the Utrecht School of Caravaggisti. He was buried on 28 February 1624 in the Buurkerk, a medieval church which now houses the Museum Speelklok. Around 1629, Constantijn Huygens noted Baburen as one of the important Dutch painters active in the early decades of the seventeenth century.

==Career==
Dirck van Baburen&#x27;s career was short, and only a few of his paintings are known today. He mostly painted religious subjects in Rome, including the San Pietro in Montorio &quot;Entombment&quot; that is indebted to Caravaggio&#x27;s version of the same subject in the Vatican Museums. Baburen also painted a &quot;Capture of Christ&quot; (Borghese Gallery) for Scipione Borghese and &quot;Christ Washing the Feet of the Apostles&quot; (Gemäldegalerie, Berlin) for Vincenzo Giustiniani.

The Utrecht works made between 1621 as 1624, the final years of Baburen&#x27;s career, merged the visual characteristics learnt from Caravaggio and Manfredi into genre, mythological and history painting. &quot;Prometheus Being Chained by Vulcan&quot; (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), for example, adapts Caravaggio&#x27;s upside-down figure of St. Paul from the &quot;Conversion of St. Paul&quot; (Santa Maria del Popolo, Rome) for the position of the fallen Prometheus, who was punished for stealing fire from the gods and giving it to mortals.

He was among the first artists to make use of genre subjects such as musicians and cardplayers. One of his best-known works is &quot;The Procuress&quot; (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston). It depicts a man offering a coin for the services of a lute-playing prostitute while an old woman, the lady&#x27;s procuress, inspects his money. This painting (or a copy) was owned by Johannes Vermeer&#x27;s mother-in-law and appears in two of that artist&#x27;s works, &quot;The Concert&quot; (stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston) and &quot;Woman Seated at a Virginal&quot; (National Gallery, London). Han van Meegeren forged copy of this work which he may have intended to use as a prop in his forgeries of Vermeer.

<text>Farnworth is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton, Greater Manchester, England, southeast of Bolton, 4 miles south-west of Bury (7 km), and northwest of Manchester.

Within the historic county of Lancashire, Farnworth lies on the River Irwell and River Croal. At the 2011 Census, it had a population of 26,939.

==History==

===Toponymy===
Farnworth derives from the Old English &quot;fearn&quot;, fern and &quot;worth&quot; an enclosure. Farnworth was recorded as Farneworth and Farnewrth in 1278 and 1279 and Ffornword in a land survey of 1282.

===Middle Ages===
Farnworth was originally a hamlet in Barton. In the 13th century it was held by the Lords of Barton and Manchester. By 1320 Adam Lever, Richard Hulton and Richard Redford held the manor as tenants. Later the manor was acquired by the Hultons of Over Hulton. In 1666 there were 91 hearths in Farnworth liable to pay tax. The commons were enclosed in 1798. There was a watermill on the River Croal.

===Industrial Revolution===
The town expanded rapidly in the 18th and 19th centuries around the coal mining industry. The collieries were part of an extensive mine complex, the Worsley Navigable Levels whose underground canals stretched from the Delph at Worsley and linked the mines to the Bridgewater Canal. Other industry included iron foundries and cotton mills.

The owner of Farnworth Paper mills, T. B. Crompton, patented a continuous-drying process which contributed to the mechanisation of papermaking in 1821.

The adjoining open land of Halshaw Moor became an area for recreation for the town, hosting the annual Halshaw Moor Wakes that were described as 

==Governance==
Lying within the boundaries of Lancashire since the early 12th century, Farnworth constituted a township and chapelry within the ecclesiastical parish of Deane. In 1837 Farnworth became part of the Bolton Poor Law Union which took responsibility for funding the Poor Law in that area. In 1863, a Local board of health was established for the township, and in 1866, it also became a separate civil parish. In 1899, under the Local Government Act 1894, Farnworth became an Urban District. In 1939, the district was granted by a charter to become the Municipal Borough of Farnworth. In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the municipal borough was abolished and its area became an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton in Greater Manchester. Farnworth has two of Bolton Council&#x27;s 20 wards, which each are represented by three councillors. At first, the wards were called Farnworth North and Farnworth South, but following name and boundary changes in 1980 the eastern side of the town is covered by the Farnworth ward and the western half side is covered by the Harper Green ward.

Under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, the Radcliffe-cum-Farnworth constituency was established with one Member of Parliament (MP). The constituency was abolished in 1918 with Radcliffe becoming part of the Heywood and Radcliffe constituency, and Farnworth having its own Parliament constituency. The Farnworth constituency continued until it was abolished in 1983 and became part of the Bolton South East constituency.

==Geography==
Farnworth measures about two miles from east to west, and one from north to south with an area of on land sloping towards the north-east by the River Croal which forms the boundary. Will Hill Brook forms the northern boundary. The underlying rocks are the coal measures of the Manchester Coalfield. Districts in Farnworth include Dixon Green and New Bury. The town has grown along the Manchester to Bolton road, the A666 and the A575 road to Worsley and Eccles. Plodder Lane, the B6199, goes west past the Royal Bolton Hospital.

<doc id="753474" wikidata="Q1470976" url="?curid=753474" title="2002 NBA draft">
<text>The [[2002–03 NBA season|2002]] [[NBA draft]] was held on June 26, 2002, at The Theater at Madison Square Garden. In this draft, National Basketball Association (NBA) teams took turns selecting 57 amateur college basketball players and other first-time eligible players, such as players from non-North American leagues. This was the last draft that was broadcast on TNT, as ESPN obtained the rights for the 2024 draft via its incoming deal (which it retains to this day). The NBA announced that about 42 college and high school players, and five international players, had filed as early-entry candidates for the draft. The Chicago Bulls and the Golden State Warriors each had a 22.5% chance of acquiring the first pick, but the Houston Rockets, with just an 8.9% probability, won the NBA draft lottery on May 19. The Bulls and Warriors were second and third, respectively. As punishment for salary-cap violations during the 2001-02 season, the Minnesota Timberwolves forfeited their first-round draft pick.

The 2002 draft set a record of 17 international selections, with six of them coming in the first round.

Two months after the conclusion of his rookie season, number-two pick Jay Williams nearly lost his life in a motorcycle crash that shattered his pelvis, severed a main nerve in his leg and tore three ligaments in his left knee, including his ACL. Despite intense rehabilitation, Williams never played a game in the NBA again. When it became clear Williams could not return to the Bulls because of his injuries, the team waived him. The Bulls could have voided Williams&#x27; contract because it prohibited riding a motorcycle. However, the franchise bought out his contract for $3 million in 2004 instead of having him walk away with nothing.

The draft class was relatively weak outside of the top prospects. Several players selected early had promising careers that ended prematurely due to injury, including Yao Ming, Williams and Dajuan Wagner. Nevertheless, Yao was named a Hall of Famer—a selection predicated as much on his role in popularizing basketball in China as it was for his on-court play. Three players selected in this draft - including Yao, second-round pick Carlos Boozer and Rookie of the Year Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire - would be named to the All-NBA Team during their careers. Caron Butler was the only other player to become an All-Star. First-round pick Tayshaun Prince was also named to the NBA All-Defensive Team four times.

As of the end of the 2022–23 NBA season, Udonis Haslem was the last remaining active draft-eligible player from the 2002 class, though he went undrafted (he made his NBA debut the following season). He stopped playing after the 2022–23 season.

Nine of the players selected in this draft never played in an NBA game throughout their professional basketball careers. Three of those players were the sole selection of the draft from their respective teams: Peter Fehse (Seattle&#x27;s only pick), Marcus Taylor (Minnesota&#x27;s only pick) and Mladen Šekularac (Dallas&#x27; only pick).

==Draft selections==


==Notable undrafted players==

These eligible players were not selected in this draft but played at least one game in the NBA.
==Early entrants==
===College underclassmen===
This year would mark a bit of a step down in terms of the number of underclassmen entering the NBA draft when compared to last year. While it would be the second time the number of underclassmen would exceed the number of draft picks available in the NBA, this year only saw a total of 72 underclassmen from college and overseas declare their initial entry into the NBA draft. However, it would exceed the amount of withdrawn players with 24 players doing exactly that, leaving a total of 48 eligible underclassmen available for the draft this year. The following college basketball players successfully applied for early draft entrance.
* Lee Benson – F, Brown Mackie (freshman)
* Rodney Bias – F, Alabama (sophomore)
* Cordell Billups – G, Pierce (Washington) (sophomore)

===High school players===
This would be the eighth straight year in a row where at least one high school player would declare their entry into the NBA draft directly out of high school after previously only allowing it one time back in 1975. It would also mark the first time a player directly out of high school would win the NBA Rookie of the Year Award with Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire earning the honor one year before LeBron James would enter the NBA. The following high school players successfully applied for early draft entrance.
* DeAngelo Collins – F, Inglewood High School (Inglewood, California)
* Lenny Cooke – G, Mott Adult High School (Flint, Michigan)
* Giedrius Rinkevicius – C, Bridgton Academy (Bridgton, Maine)

<doc id="753475" wikidata="Q910212" url="?curid=753475" title="Plasticizer">
<text>A plasticizer (UK: plasticiser) is a substance that is added to a material to make it softer and more flexible, to increase its plasticity, to decrease its viscosity, and/or to decrease friction during its handling in manufacture.

Plasticizers are commonly added to polymers and plastics such as PVC, either to facilitate the handling of the raw material during fabrication, or to meet the demands of the end product&#x27;s application. Plasticizers are especially key to the usability of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), the third most widely used plastic. In the absence of plasticizers, PVC is hard and brittle; with plasticizers, it is suitable for products such as vinyl siding, roofing, vinyl flooring, rain gutters, plumbing, and electric wire insulation/coating.

Plasticizers are also often added to concrete formulations to make them more workable and fluid for pouring, thus allowing the water contents to be reduced. Similarly, they are often added to clays, stucco, solid rocket fuel, and other pastes prior to molding and forming. For these applications, plasticizers largely overlap with dispersants.

==For polymers==


Plasticizers for polymers are either liquids with low volatility or solids. According to 2017 data, the total global market for plasticizers was 7.5 million metric tonnes. In North America the 2017 volume was ~1.01 million metric tonnes and in Europe the figure was 1.35 million metric tonnes, split between various end-use applications with a chemical type trend moving to higher molecular weight (HMW) orthophthalates and alternative types following regulatory issues concerning lower molecular weight (LMW) orthophthalates.

Almost 90% of polymer plasticizers, most commonly phthalate esters, are used in PVC, giving this material improved flexibility and durability. Other polymers which can contain high loadings of plasticizers include acrylates and cellulose-type plastics, such as cellulose acetate, nitrocellulose and cellulose acetate butyrate.

===Mechanism of action ===
It was commonly thought that plasticizers work by embedding themselves between the chains of polymers, spacing them apart (increasing the &quot;free volume&quot;), or swelling them and thus significantly lowering the glass transition temperature for the plastic and making it softer. It was later shown that the free volume explanation could not account for all of the effects of plasticization. The mobility of a polymer chain is more complex in the presence of plasticizer than what the Flory–Fox equation predicts for a simple polymer chain.

The molecules of plasticizer take control over mobility of the chain - a polymer chain does not show an increase of the free volume around polymer ends. If plasticizer/water creates hydrogen bonds with hydrophilic parts of the polymer, the associated free volume can be decreased. 

The effect of plasticizers on elastic modulus is dependent on both temperature and plasticizer concentration. Below a certain concentration, referred to as the crossover concentration, a plasticizer can decrease the modulus of a material. The material&#x27;s glass transition temperature will decrease, however, at all concentrations. In addition to a crossover concentration, a crossover temperature exists. Below the crossover temperature the plasticizer will also increase the modulus.

===Selection===
Over the last 60 years more than 30,000 different substances have been evaluated for their suitability as polymer plasticizers. Of these, only a small number – approximately 50 – are today in commercial use.

Ester plasticizers are selected based upon cost-performance evaluation. The rubber compounder must evaluate ester plasticizers for compatibility, processibility, permanence and other performance properties. The wide variety of ester chemistries that are in production include sebacates, adipates, terephthalates, dibenzoates, glutarates, phthalates, azelates, and other specialty blends. This broad product line provides an array of performance benefits required for the many elastomer applications such as tubing and hose products, flooring, wall-coverings, seals and gaskets, belts, wire and cable, and print rolls.

Low to high polarity esters provide utility in a wide range of elastomers including nitrile, polychloroprene, EPDM, chlorinated polyethylene, and epichlorohydrin. Plasticizer-elastomer interaction is governed by many factors such as solubility parameter, molecular weight, and chemical structure. Compatibility and performance attributes are key factors in developing a rubber formulation for a particular application.

Plasticizers used in PVC and other plastics are often based on esters of polycarboxylic acids with linear or branched aliphatic alcohols of moderate chain length. These compounds are selected on the basis of many critieria including low toxicity, compatibility with the host material, nonvolatility, and expense. Phthalate esters of straight-chain and branched-chain alkyl alcohols meet these specifications and are common plasticizers. Ortho-phthalate esters have traditionally been the most dominant plasticizers, but regulatory concerns have led to the move away from classified substances to non-classified which includes high molecular weight ortho-phthalates and other plasticisers, especially in Europe.

===Antiplasticizers===
Antiplasticizers are polymer additives that have effect opposite to those of plasticizers. They increase the modulus while decreasing the glass transition temperature.
===Safety and toxicity===
Substantial concerns have been expressed over the safety of some polymer plasticizers, especially because some low molecular weight ortho-phthalates have been classified as potential endocrine disruptors with some developmental toxicity reported. Plasticizers can escape plastics due to migration and abrasion of the plastic since they are not bound to the polymer matrix. The &quot;new car smell&quot; is often attributed to plasticizers or their degradation products, however, multiple studies on the makeup of the smell do not find phthalates in appreciable amounts, likely due to their extremely low volatility and vapor pressure.

===Common polymer plasticizers===
====Ortho phthalates====
*Phthalate-based plasticizers are used in situations where good resistance to water and oils is required. Some common phthalate plasticizers are:
*Low Molecular Weight Ortho Phthalates
**Dimethyl phthalate (DMP), used in fragrances, as an insect repellent, and in several industrial processes as a solvent/carrier
**Diethyl phthalate (DEP), used in fragrances as a carrier and extender/fixative
**Diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP)
**Di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), used for cellulose plastics, food wraps, adhesives, perfumes, and cosmetics - about a third of nail polishes, glosses, enamels, and hardeners contain it, together with some shampoos, sunscreens, skin emollients, and insect repellents
**Butyl benzyl phthalate (benzyl butyl phthalate, BBzP) is found in vinyl tiles, traffic cones, food conveyor belts, artificial leather, and plastic foams
**Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) also commonly known as (dioctyl phthalate, DOP or diethylhexyl phthalate), historically used in flooring materials, medical devices, myriad consumer products, and high explosives, such as Semtex. DEHP was the most common plasticizer for decades and still holds that title globally even as it has largely been replaced now with higher molecular weight phthalates and alternatives in the US and Europe
*High Molecular Weight Ortho Phthalates
**Diisononyl phthalate (DINP), used in flooring materials, found in garden hoses, shoes, toys, and building materials
**Bis(2-propylheptyl) phthalate (DPHP), used in cables, wires and roofing materials
**Diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), used for insulation of wires and cables, car undercoating, shoes, carpets, pool liners
**Diisoundecyl phthalate (DIUP), used for insulation of wires and cables, car undercoating, shoes, carpets, pool liners. Good high temperature and outdoor weathering performance
**Ditridecyl phthalate (DTDP) is the highest molecular weight phthalate plasticizer, providing greater performance at high temperature. It is the preferred plasticizer for automotive cable and wire application.

====Terephthalates====
*Terephthalates are isomeric with ortho phthalates but have proven to have cleaner toxicological results due to their inability to form stable monoesters during hydrolysis and metabolic breakdown.
**Bis(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DEHT; Dioctyl terephthalate, DOTP) (Eastman Chemical Company Trademark: Eastman 168™), used as a replacement for DEHP and DINP 
**Diisopentyl terephthalate (DiPT)(Evonik Industries Trademark: ELATUR® DPT), used as a replacement for DBP and DiBP
**Dibutyl terephthalate (DBT)(Eastman Chemical Trademark: Eastman Effusion™), used as a replacement for DBP and DiBP

====Trimellitates====
*Trimellitates are used in automobile interiors and other applications where resistance to high temperature is required. They have extremely low volatility.
**Tri(2-ethylhexyl)trimellitate (TEHTM) (TOTM, Trioctyl Trimellitate plasticizer) 
**Tri(isononyl)trimellitate (TINTM)
**Tri(isodecyl)trimellitate (TIDTM)
**Tri(isotridecyl)trimellitate (TITDTM)

====Adipates &amp; Sebacates ====
*Adipate-based plasticizers are used for low-temperature or resistance to ultraviolet light. An example is:
**Bis(2-ethylhexyl)adipate (DEHA, dioctyl adipate plasticizer)
*Sebacate- based plasticizers provide excellent compatibility with a range of plastic materials and synthetic rubbers (specifically nitrile rubber and neoprene), superior properties at low temperatures, and good oil resistivity. Some examples are: 
**Dibutyl sebacate (DBS)
**Di(2-ethylhexyl)sebacate, Di-octyl Sebacate (or DOS plasticizer)

====Organophosphates====
*Organophosphates include the following:
**Tricresyl phosphate (TCP)
**2-Ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate

====Other====
*1,2-Cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester (BASF Trademark: Hexamoll DINCH)
*Bis(2-ethylhexyl) cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylate (Hanwha Trademark: Eco-DEHCH)
*Alkyl sulphonic acid phenyl ester (ASE). (Lanxess Chemical Trademark: Mesamoll)
*Triethylene glycol di-2ethylhexanoate (Eastman Chemical Trademark: Eastman TEG-EH)

Bio-based plasticizers have been investigated, such as glycerol triacetate (Triacetin) and acetyltributylcitrate. They are used in niche applications. Epoxidized soybean oil is used broadly as a secondary plasticizer in many vinyl applications.

*Note: Bisphenol A, or BPA, is not a plasticizer, although it is often wrongly described as one.

==For inorganic materials==
===Concrete===
In the concrete technology, plasticizers and superplasticizers are also called high range water reducers. When added to concrete mixtures, they confer a number of properties including improved workability and strength. The strength of concrete is inversely proportional to the amount of water added, i.e., the water-cement (w/c) ratio. In order to produce stronger concrete, less water is added (without &quot;starving&quot; the mix), which makes the concrete mixture less workable and difficult to mix, necessitating the use of plasticizers, water reducers, superplasticizers, fluidizer or dispersants.

Plasticizers are also often used when pozzolanic ash is added to concrete to improve strength. This method of mix proportioning is especially popular when producing high-strength concrete and fiber-reinforced concrete.

Adding 1-2% plasticizer per unit weight of cement is usually sufficient. Adding an excessive amount of plasticizer will result in excessive segregation of concrete and is not advisable. Depending on the particular chemical used, use of too much plasticizer may result in a retarding effect.

Plasticizers are commonly manufactured from lignosulfonates, a by-product from the paper industry. Superplasticizers have generally been manufactured from sulfonated naphthalene condensate or sulfonated melamine formaldehyde, although newer products based on polycarboxylic ethers are now available. Traditional lignosulfonate-based plasticisers, naphthalene and melamine sulfonate-based superplasticisers disperse the flocculated cement particles through a mechanism of electrostatic repulsion (see colloid). In normal plasticisers, the active substances are adsorbed on to the cement particles, giving them a negative charge, which leads to repulsion between particles. Lignin, naphthalene, and melamine sulfonate superplasticisers are organic polymers. The long molecules wrap themselves around the cement particles, giving them a highly negative charge so that they repel each other.

Polycarboxylate ether superplasticizer (PCE) or just polycarboxylate (PC), work differently from sulfonate-based superplasticizers, giving cement dispersion by steric stabilisation. This form of dispersion is more powerful in its effect and gives improved workability retention to the cementitious mix.

===Stucco===
Plasticizers can be added to wallboard stucco mixtures to improve workability. In order to reduce the energy consumed drying wallboard, less water is added, which makes the gypsum mixture very unworkable and difficult to mix, necessitating the use of plasticizers, water reducers, or dispersants. Some studies also show that too much lignosulfonate dispersant could result in a set-retarding effect. Data showed that amorphous crystal formations occurred that detracted from the mechanical needle-like crystal interaction in the core, preventing a stronger core. The sugars, chelating agents in lignosulfonates such as aldonic acids and extractive compounds are mainly responsible for set retardation. These low range water reducing dispersants are commonly manufactured from lignosulfonates, a by-product from the paper industry.

High range superplasticizers (dispersants) have generally been manufactured from sulfonated naphthalene condensate, although polycarboxylic ethers represent more modern alternatives. Both of these high range water reducers are used at 1/2 to 1/3 of the lignosulfonate types.

Traditional lignosulfonate and naphthalene sulfonate-based plasticisers disperse the flocculated gypsum particles through a mechanism of electrostatic repulsion (see Colloid). In normal plasticisers, the active substances are adsorbed on to the gypsum particles, giving them a negative charge, which leads to repulsion between particles. Lignin and naphthalene sulfonate plasticizers are organic polymers. The long molecules wrap themselves around the gypsum particles, giving them a highly negative charge so that they repel each other.

===Energetic materials===
Energetic material pyrotechnic compositions, especially solid rocket propellants and smokeless powders for guns, often employ plasticizers to improve physical properties of the propellant binder or of the overall propellant, to provide a secondary fuel, and ideally, to improve specific energy yield (e.g. specific impulse, energy yield per gram of propellant, or similar indices) of the propellant. An energetic plasticizer improves the physical properties of an energetic material while also increasing its specific energy yield. Energetic plasticizers are usually preferred to non-energetic plasticizers, especially for solid rocket propellants. Energetic plasticizers reduce the required mass of propellant, enabling a rocket vehicle to carry more payload or reach higher velocities than would otherwise be the case. However, safety or cost considerations may demand that non-energetic plasticizers be used, even in rocket propellants. The solid rocket propellant used to fuel the Space Shuttle solid rocket booster employs HTPB, a synthetic rubber, as a non-energetic secondary fuel.

====Plasticizers for energetic materials====
Here are some energetic plasticizers used in rocket propellants and smokeless powders:
*Nitroglycerine (NG, aka &quot;nitro&quot;, glyceryl trinitrate)
*Butanetriol trinitrate (BTTN)
*Dinitrotoluene (DNT)
*Trimethylolethane trinitrate (TMETN, aka Metriol trinitrate, METN)
*Diethylene glycol dinitrate (DEGDN, less commonly DEGN)
*Triethylene glycol dinitrate (TEGDN, less commonly TEGN)
*Bis(2,2-dinitropropyl)formal (BDNPF)
*Bis(2,2-dinitropropyl)acetal (BDNPA)
*2,2,2-Trinitroethyl 2-nitroxyethyl ether (TNEN)
Due to the secondary alcohol groups, NG and BTTN have relatively low thermal stability. TMETN, DEGDN, BDNPF, and BDNPA have relatively low energies. NG and DEGDN have relatively high vapor pressure.

<text>Cyril Nelson &quot;Kid&quot; Lowe, (7 October 1891 – 6 February 1983) was an English rugby union footballer who held England&#x27;s international try scoring record for over sixty years, a First World War flying ace credited with nine victories, and supposedly the inspiration for W. E. Johns&#x27; character &quot;Biggles&quot;.

== Early life ==
Lowe was born in Holbeach, Lincolnshire. He attended Dulwich College where he was a boarder in Orchard House. He edited the school magazine, &quot;The Alleynian&quot;, from 1910 to 1911, as his fellow alumnus P. G. Wodehouse had done previously. At Dulwich, he excelled at a number of sports, and represented the school in boxing, athletics, swimming, cricket and rugby. He captained the Athletics squad in 1911 and in the same year played for the first XI cricket squad. In this same cricket side, he played alongside future England captain, Arthur Gilligan, the future Essex wicket-keeper Frank Gilligan and R. K. Nunes; the future captain of the West Indies. Eclipsing these sporting achievements was his record as a rugby player. He was in the side first XV from 1908 and was in the unbeaten first XV rugby union squad in 1909; which contained five future internationals dubbed the &#x27;Famous Five&#x27;. These five would all go on to play in the 1913 Varsity match, (and also produced the captains of both Oxford and Cambridge in 1919), and all of whom served in the First World War. They were Eric Loudoun-Shand and Grahame Donald who both went on to play for Scotland, W. D. Doherty who went on to play for and captain Ireland, J. E. Greenwood who went on to play for and captain England and Cyril Lowe himself. He then went on to captain the side in 1910–11. Despite his sporting prowess, Lowe was not physically imposing, standing and weighing around nine-and-a-half stone () while at school. His small stature led to his nickname at school being &quot;Tich&quot; Lowe. He was described by the school magazine, &quot;The Alleynian&quot;, as &quot;A first rate centre three-quarter. Very fast, with a capital pair of hands, a first-rate dodge on a dry ground, and a good pair of feet on the wet.&quot;

He went on to Cambridge University where he won rugby blues in 1911, 1912 and 1913, making him a rare triple blue.

== Rugby career ==
Cyril Lowe, whilst still at Cambridge, was called up to play for England in 1913. This was to be the beginning of an international career that spanned either side of the First World War, in which he scored a record 18 tries in 25 internationals and was on the losing side only three times, twice to Wales and once to South Africa. He played in four Grand Slam-winning sides until his retirement in 1923. In 1913 and 1914 he won back-to-back Five Nation Grand Slams and his eight try haul in 1914 remains a Championship record, only ever equaled by one other player, Ian Smith of Scotland.

At club level, after leaving Cambridge, Lowe represented Blackheath, and was later the RAF representative on the Rugby Union Committee.

Lowe&#x27;s sporting career was interrupted by the outbreak of hostilities in 1914. Lowe returned to his rugby career in 1920, playing for England. He retired from international rugby in 1923 with 25 caps, and would have gained more were it not for the war. His career total 18 tries remained an English record at his death and it was only equaled and later surpassed by another Royal Air Force pilot Rory Underwood in 1989, 66 years after Lowe&#x27;s retirement. It has subsequently been achieved by other players, though internationals are more frequent in the modern game and are generally higher scoring.

==Military career==
===First World War===
Joining the army soon after the outbreak of the First World War, Lowe was commissioned into the Army Service Corps as a temporary second lieutenant on 31 August 1914. He was promoted to lieutenant on 20 January 1915, and to captain on 30 April 1916.

Lowe was transferred to the General List to serve in the Royal Flying Corps, and appointed a flying officer on 30 September 1916. He was posted to No. 11 Squadron, and was appointed a flight commander on 11 February 1917. Flying a F.E.2b with observer/gunner Second Lieutenant G. Masters, Lowe gained his first victory on 15 March 1917, destroying a Type C aircraft over Bailleul. On 24 March, he drove down out of control an Albatros D.III over Fontaine-lès-Croisilles, but was wounded when shot down by Reinhold Jörke later on the same day. Lowe returned to flying duty in early-1918, when posted to No. 24 Squadron, flying the S.E.5a single-seat fighter. Between 23 April and 1 July 1918, Lowe scored seven more victories, sharing one with Lieutenant Ronald T. Mark, destroying three and driving down four more out of control, to bring his total to nine.

Lowe was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, which was gazetted on 3 August 1918. His citation read:
This was followed by the award of the Military Cross, gazetted on 16 September 1918. The citation read:
Lowe left the RAF after the war, being transferred to unemployed list on 2 March 1919.

===Post-war career===
Lowe returned to serve in the Royal Air Force on a three-year short service commission with the rank of flight lieutenant on 12 January 1921, but this was later cancelled and he was granted a permanent commission on 17 April 1923, backdated to January 1921. He was promoted to squadron leader on 1 July 1925, and was posted to the Headquarters of the Special Reserve and Auxiliary Air Force on 7 September 1925. However, on 14 September 1925 he was appointed temporary commander of No. 602 City of Glasgow (Bombing) Squadron of the Auxiliary Air Force. On 1 April 1926, he was appointed commander of No. 1 Squadron, based in Iraq, and on 1 November 1926 was transferred to No. 6 Armoured Car Company.

Lowe eventually returned to England, and was commander of No. 43 Squadron, based at RAF Tangmere by June 1928, the squadron becoming highly regarded for their aerobatic displays. He was posted to No. 2 Flying Training School, based at RAF Digby, on 18 November 1930. Lowe was promoted to wing commander on 1 January 1933, and in August was appointed chief instructor of the Oxford University Air Squadron, succeeding Keith Park, and being the first Cambridge man to command the Oxford Squadron. On 31 December 1937 Lowe was promoted to group captain, and retired from the Royal Air Force on 7 October 1944.
Lowe died in 1983, aged 91.

<text>Featherstone is a town and civil parish in the City of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England, two miles south-west of Pontefract. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, in 2011 it had a population of 15,244. Featherstone railway station is on the Pontefract Line.

==History==

Despite most population growth taking place around the Industrial Revolution, Featherstone traces its history back much further than this. The Domesday Book (1086) records &quot;In Ferestane [Featherstone] and Prestone [Purston] and Arduwic [Hardwick] and Osele [Nostell], Ligulf had 16 carucates of land for geld, and 6 ploughs may be there.&quot; It is thought that a local public house, the Traveller&#x27;s Rest, can trace its origins to the 17th century whilst the former Jubilee Hotel, a listed building now converted to apartments, once provided a resting place for wealthy Victorians and their horses.
Standing stone&#x27;s just outside the village indicate that there is evidence of an ancient druid grove.

The original village is now known as North Featherstone (at the junction of the B6134 and the B6421 today), set around All Saints&#x27; Church and joined to today&#x27;s centre by Featherstone Lane. The Featherstone family lived at Ackton Hall (now demolished), in the hamlet of Ackton about a mile to the west. What is now known as Featherstone was a later development (originally called South Featherstone) near to the railway station and the village of Purston Jaglin.

Like many surrounding areas, Featherstone grew around coal mining. Coal had been mined at Featherstone since the 13th century and remains of bell pits can still be seen to the north of Park Lane at North Featherstone. In 1848, the opening of the Wakefield, Pontefract and Goole railway line through Featherstone provided the basis for large scale coal mining in Featherstone, by opening up new markets in the South of England and Europe. Featherstone Main Colliery was opened in 1866, followed by Ackton Hall Colliery in 1873. These were closer to what is now the main part of Featherstone, which consequently expanded.
The town came to national attention during a national &quot;lockout&quot; of mine workers in 1893 due to low coal prices and overproduction. Soldiers fired on a crowd who were demonstrating at the colliery gates, killing two instantly. (The Guardian claimed that a third man, a Mr. Tomlinson from Normanton, died the following day from injuries from being shot but only two dead are named on the town&#x27;s sculpture.) A distinctive sculpture marking the centenary of the Featherstone Massacre stands in the shopping precinct and a large mural depicting the town&#x27;s heritage can be seen at the town&#x27;s main crossroads. Ackton Hall Colliery was the first pit to close following the end of the miners&#x27; strike and this could not be contested as geological difficulties had made it impossible for the pit to continue production.

Featherstone is the subject of a study, &quot;Coal is Our Life, by&quot; the sociologist Norman Dennis, published in 1956.

Opened in the 1950s, Purston Park takes up a large area of space and offers a lake and a children&#x27;s play area. There was also previously a bowling green, until being changed to a rose garden in 2004. It has been made out of the grounds of what was originally a private residence and a country estate, with the stately home formerly acting as the town hall. This building was sold to developers in 2007 and has since been converted into luxury flats.

Featherstone is undergoing continual change and as part of this a new, state-of-the-art £2.5-million community centre has been built in Station Lane. The &quot;Pit Houses&quot;, the houses constituting a council estate which formerly belonged to the National Coal Board, have been demolished to make room for further developments.

==Memorials==
In 2018, a sculpture was erected called &quot;War Horse - A Place of Peace to be Together&quot;, to commemorate the soldiers from the town who died in the First World War. It was designed by model makers and artists Cod Steaks, and funded by a grant from FCC Communities Foundation (formerly known as WREN).

==Toponymy==

Like many place-names in the area, &#x27;Featherstone&#x27; derives from Old English. The name is formed of two elements: , meaning &#x27;four&#x27;, and &quot;stān&quot;, meaning &#x27;stone&#x27;. Therefore, the names means &quot;(place at) the four stones&quot;. These &#x27;four stones&#x27; are likely to have been some waymarker or monument by a road or other well-used route through the town. The settlement was recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 as &quot;Fredestan&quot;.

== Governance ==

Featherstone village historically formed a township within the much larger (ecclesiastical) parish of Featherstone; the parish also included Purston Jaglin, Whitwood and Ackton. In 1894, Featherstone urban district (UD) was formed from the civil parishes of Featherstone, Purston Jaglin, Ackton and Snydale. In 1974 the town became part of the metropolitan borough of Wakefield; currently the borough&#x27;s Featherstone ward comprises the former UD area plus Sharlston.

Featherstone is currently a Labour stronghold. It is part of the Normanton and Hemsworth constituency, and is represented by Labour MP Jon Trickett in the House of Commons and by three Labour Councillors on Wakefield Council: Steve Vickers, Graham Isherwood and Maureen Tennant-King. Featherstone Town Council is also controlled by Labour, Cllr Dwain Longley OStJ is the Mayor for the year 2024/2025

== Fighting decline ==
Starting in the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, the area went into an era of sharp decline in the residents&#x27; quality of life. Historians and social scientists have put forward many factors. The gradual loss of the coal industry coupled with poor housing and education. This has begun to improve in recent years with new housing developments, better schools and plans to breathe life back into the local business community via various climate friendly projects.

==Transport==

Featherstone has a railway station on the Pontefract Line. There are also bus services operated by Arriva Yorkshire and Ross Travel. The M62 lies close by.

== Education ==
The town has two secondary schools, the Featherstone Academy and St Wilfrid&#x27;s Catholic High School.

Primary and infant schools include St Thomas&#x27; Junior, Girnhill Infants&#x27;, Purston Infants&#x27;, North Featherstone Junior and Infants&#x27; and All Saints Junior and Infants&#x27;.

==Religion==
Featherstone has a number of churches: St Thomas&#x27;s Church (Anglican) – built from traditional Yorkshire sandstone, St Thomas&#x27;s Church and the adjacent vicarage were built in the 1870s. Due to a lack of funding the church has no bell tower, and instead the bell hangs outside on the church&#x27;s south wall. The original vicarage is now a private residence. All Saints&#x27; Church (Anglican), the Methodist church, and the South Featherstone Gospel Hall are also still active churches.

A former Methodist chapel on Wakefield Road has since been turned into an antiques salesroom and the North Featherstone Gospel Hall has been converted into a private dwelling. St Gerard Majella&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church was closed in the summer of 2008.

==Sport==

===Featherstone Rovers===
The town&#x27;s sport scene is dominated by its local rugby league club, Featherstone Rovers, who have won the Challenge Cup on three occasions, most recently on 7 May 1983, and won the League Championship in 1976–77. Originally made up of local miners, the club was formed in the Railway Hotel in 1902, then re-formed in 1906. They are currently in the Championship, after being promoted in 2007, beating Oldham in the Play-Offs final. In the 2010 season, Rovers finished first in the league table with a 100% away record and claimed the League Leader&#x27;s Shield. They reached the Championship Grand Final by beating Halifax 46–16 in the Semi-Final, only to be defeated by Halifax in the final on a golden point (22–23). They went one better in 2012 beating Sheffield Eagles 44–4 in the Grand Final to become Champions. In 2021, the club won the RFL 1895 Cup.

The Featherstone Rovers Women&#x27;s team was launched in 2011 and won the Women&#x27;s Challenge Cup in 2012. They were one of the four teams to take part in the inaugural season of the RFL Women&#x27;s Super League in 2017.

===Featherstone Lions===

The community side Featherstone Lions also hails from the town and currently play their home games from their base, Mill Pond Stadium. Featherstone Lions have open age men&#x27;s teams that play in the National Conference League Yorkshire Men&#x27;s League they also have junior teams from U7-U18 both boys and girls along with a women&#x27;s open age side.

<text>An opera hat, also called a or gibus, is a top hat variant that is collapsible through a spring system, originally intended for less spacious venues, such as the theatre and opera house.

Typically made of black satin, it folds vertically through a push or a snap on the top of the hat for convenient storage in a wardrobe or under the seat. It opens with a push from underneath.

Its French name &quot;chapeau claque&quot; is a composition of &quot;chapeau&quot;, which means hat, and &quot;claque&quot;, which means &quot;tap&quot; or &quot;click&quot;. The &quot;chapeau claque&quot; is thus a hat that folds with a click, and unfolds likewise.

In English, the hat model is usually referred to as a &quot;collapsible top-hat&quot;, &quot;gibus&quot; or more often &quot;opera hat&quot;.

==History==

The construction may originally have been inspired by a historical hat model called &quot;chapeau bras&quot; (&quot;arm hat&quot;), made as bicorne or tricorne to be carried folded under the arm.

On May 5, 1812, London hatter Thomas Francis Dollman patented a design for &quot;an elastic round hat&quot; supported by ribs and springs. His patent was described as:

Some sources have taken this to describe an early folding top hat, although it is not explicitly stated whether Dollman&#x27;s design was specifically for male or female headgear. Dollman&#x27;s patent expired in 1825. Operating from Poissy, Paris, France, around 1840, Antoine Gibus&#x27;s design for a spring-loaded collapsible top-hat proved so popular that hats made to it became known as &quot;gibus&quot;. They were also often called &quot;opera hats&quot; due to the common practice of storing them in their flattened state under one&#x27;s seat at the opera, though the term can also refer to any tall formal men&#x27;s hat. The characteristic snapping sound heard upon opening a gibus suggested a third name, the &quot;chapeau claque&quot;, &quot;claque&quot; being the French word for &quot;slap&quot;.

<text>Juan Max Dixon (born October 9, 1978) is an American former professional basketball player and the previous head coach for Coppin State University in Baltimore. Dixon led the University of Maryland Terrapins to their first NCAA championship in 2002 and earned Most Outstanding Player honors at the 2002 Final Four.

==Early life==
Dixon was born in Baltimore, Maryland, where he attended Lake Clifton High School as a freshman. He then attended and played basketball at Calvert Hall, a high school in Towson, Maryland. While at Calvert Hall, he scored 1,590 career points under the tutelage of head coach Mark Amatucci.

Both his mother, Juanita, and father, Phil, were addicted to heroin, and died of AIDS-related illnesses before Dixon was 17 years old. He was then raised by his grandparents Roberta and Warnick Graves in Baltimore.

Dixon&#x27;s aunt, Sheila Dixon, was the mayor of Baltimore. Dixon&#x27;s half brother is Jermaine Dixon, who played shooting guard for the University of Pittsburgh Panthers basketball team. His second cousin Brandon Driver played cornerback for the San Jose State Spartans football team. In 2016, Juan Dixon discovered that Phil Dixon was not his biological father, and that his biological father Bruce Flanigan was still alive. Flanigan had an affair with Juanita Dixon while she was separated from Phil, and a blood test confirmed his paternity. Dixon and Flanigan reconnected and became good friends.

===Personal life===
Dating since 1996, Dixon married his high-school sweetheart, Robyn Bragg, in July 2005. She works in the public relations field and was a cast member in the Bravo reality television show &quot;The Real Housewives of Potomac&quot; from 2016 to 2024. They have two sons, Corey (b. 2008) and Carter (b. 2010). The two divorced in March 2012 but still lived together in Maryland after their divorce. In August 2022, the couple remarried.

==Playing career==

===College===
Dixon arrived at the University of Maryland, College Park after head coach Gary Williams inadvertently discovered him at an AAU tournament in Georgia. Williams watched as Dixon dove for the ball down 20 points with two minutes to go. Williams was impressed by the effort.

Dixon played in 34 games his freshman year and averaged 7.4 points per game. He made improvements in his sophomore year as he averaged 18 points per game and was selected to the 1999–2000 All-ACC team.

Both Dixon and the Terps entered the 2000–01 season with high expectations. The Terps began ranked in the top ten in most major polls while Dixon was a candidate for the Naismith Award Player of the Year award and the Wooden Award Player of the Year award. Dixon helped lead the Terps to their first ever Final Four appearance where the team lost to Duke. Dixon ended the season averaging 18.2 points per game and was again elected to the All-ACC first team.

Maryland began the 2001–02 season ranked #2 in ESPN/USA Today Coaches&#x27; Poll. Dixon led the Terps to a 32–4 record and the school&#x27;s first ever National Championship. He was voted to All-ACC team and was also a first team All-American. He was also recognized as one of the nation&#x27;s best college players and was honored as the 2002 ACC Men&#x27;s Basketball Player of the Year and ACC Athlete of the Year.

He became Maryland men&#x27;s basketball&#x27;s all-time leading scorer when he scored 29 points against Wisconsin to help Maryland advance to the Sweet Sixteen, passing Len Bias (2,149 points). He also became the only player in NCAA history to accumulate 2,000 points, 300 steals and 200 three-point field goals. In addition to leaving Maryland as the highest-scoring men&#x27;s player, Dixon also left as the school&#x27;s all-time men&#x27;s leader in three-pointers made (239) and attempted (615). He is second on Maryland&#x27;s all-time steals list with 333 and third in free-throw percentage (.850). Dixon also stands as Maryland&#x27;s all-time NCAA Tournament scoring leader with 294. Upon completion of his career, Dixon&#x27;s #3 jersey was honored and now hangs in the Xfinity Center. In 2002, Juan Dixon was honored as a part of the ACC 50th Anniversary men&#x27;s basketball team, one of only 8 Terrapins selected to the 50-man team. After his senior season, Dixon was featured on the cover of a video game, &quot;NCAA Final Four 2003&quot;.

===NBA===

Dixon was drafted 17th overall by the Washington Wizards in the 2002 NBA draft. He spent the first three years of his NBA career with the Wizards. In his third season in Washington (2004–05), he averaged eight points per game, including a career-high 35 points in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals against the Chicago Bulls. Dixon signed as a free agent with the Portland Trail Blazers during the summer of 2005. Soon after, his Wizards and Terrapins teammate and friend Steve Blake signed with Portland as well. In his first game back in D.C., Dixon was given a standing ovation from the Verizon Center crowd upon coming off the bench towards the end of the first quarter. In Dixon&#x27;s first year with the Blazers, he started 42 times and played in 76 games. In his last year with the Wizards, he only started four games and played in 63. He also increased his, assists, and shooting percentage considerably in Portland. However, he was later traded at the 2007 NBA trade deadline to Toronto for Fred Jones and future considerations.

On the 2008 NBA trade deadline, February 21, 2008, Dixon was traded from the Toronto Raptors to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for center Primož Brezec and cash considerations.

On September 24, 2008, the Washington Wizards signed Dixon to a partially guaranteed one-year deal for $1.03 million, the veterans&#x27; minimum for a player with Dixon&#x27;s experience.

Dixon&#x27;s final NBA game was on April 15, 2009, in a 107–115 loss to the Boston Celtics where he recorded 3 points, 1 rebound, 2 assists and 2 steals. On September 28, 2009, Juan Dixon signed a contract with the Atlanta Hawks. He was waived October 20, 2009.

===Europe===
On November 1, 2009, Dixon signed with Aris Thessaloniki of the Greek A1 League. The next season, he joined Unicaja Málaga of Spain. In February 2010, he was suspended indefinitely by FIBA after testing positive for steroids. In March 2011, he signed with Bandırma Banvit in Turkey. He played one season before entering the coaching profession.

==Coaching career==

On November 27, 2013, Dixon joined the Maryland Terrapin coaching staff as a special assistant under head coach Mark Turgeon. In July 2016, Dixon was relieved of his duties.

On October 14, 2016, Dixon was hired as head coach of the women&#x27;s basketball team at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC). After a 3–25 season, he was hired as men&#x27;s head coach at Coppin State. After 6 seasons earning only 51 wins as a division one head coach, he was fired in March 2023.

<text>Maple Leaf Gardens is a historic building located at the northwest corner of Carlton Street and Church Street in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The building was originally constructed in 1931 as an indoor arena to host ice hockey games.

Considered one of the &quot;cathedrals&quot; of hockey, it was home to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League from 1931 to 1999. The Leafs won the Stanley Cup 11 times from 1932 to 1967 while playing at the Gardens. The first NHL All-Star Game, albeit an unofficial one, was held at the Gardens in 1934 as a benefit for Leafs forward Ace Bailey, who had suffered a career-ending head injury. The first official annual National Hockey League All-Star Game was also held at Maple Leaf Gardens in 1947.

It was home to the Toronto Huskies (1946–1947) in their single season in the Basketball Association of America (a forerunner of the National Basketball Association), the Toronto Marlboros of the Ontario Hockey League, the Toronto Toros of the World Hockey Association (1974–1976), the Toronto Blizzard of the North American Soccer League (1980–1982 indoor seasons), the Toronto Shooting Stars of the National Professional Soccer League (1996–1997), and the Toronto Rock of the National Lacrosse League (1999–2000). The NBA&#x27;s Buffalo Braves played a total of 16 regular season games at Maple Leaf Gardens from 1971 to 1975. The NBA&#x27;s Toronto Raptors played six games at the Gardens from 1997 to 1999, mostly when SkyDome was unavailable.

The arena was also one of the few venues outside the United States where Elvis Presley performed in concert (April 2, 1957). In 1972, Maple Leaf Gardens hosted Game 2 of the famous Summit Series between Team Canada and the USSR—Team Canada won the game 4–1.

After the Leafs and Raptors moved to Air Canada Centre in 1999, Maple Leaf Gardens sat largely vacant for nearly a decade as the owners refused to sell it, fearing that it would compete with the Air Canada Centre. In 2009, it was sold and underwent a major internal reconstruction, turning it into a multi-purpose facility, with a Loblaws supermarket occupying retail space on the lower floors and an arena for Toronto Metropolitan University, known as Mattamy Athletic Centre at the Gardens, occupying the top level.

==History==

===Construction===
The Toronto Maple Leafs had been playing in the Arena Gardens on Mutual Street. It was built in 1912 and held 7,500 spectators for hockey. By 1930, the Leafs managing director Conn Smythe decided the &quot;Arena&quot; was too small, and he wanted to build a new arena, larger and more impressive. After considering various sites, the site at the corner of Carlton and Church was purchased from The T. Eaton Co. Ltd. for $350,000, ($ in dollars), a price said to be $150,000 below market value. The new 12,473-seat (14,550 including standing room) arena was designed by the architectural firm of Ross and Macdonald.

To finance the construction, Smythe launched Maple Leaf Gardens Limited (MLGL), a management company that would own the arena and the Maple Leafs. A public offering of shares in MLGL was made at C$10 each ($ in dollars), with a free common share for each five preferred shares purchased. Ownership of the hockey team was transferred to MLGL in return for shares. Intending right from the start, the Gardens would host other events. W. A. Hewitt, sports editor of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, was hired as general manager of Maple Leaf Gardens to oversee all events other than professional hockey. His son, Foster Hewitt, was hired to run the radio broadcasts and oversaw the construction of the radio broadcast facilities.

The contract to construct the building was awarded to Thomson Brothers Construction of Port Credit in Toronto Township. Thomson Bros bid just under $990,000 for the project, the lowest of ten tenders received, mainly because amongst the Thomson Brothers&#x27; various enterprises they had much of the sub-contract work covered (Thomson Lumber, Thomson Bros. Excavation), and others could not compete in this manner. That price did not include steelwork, which was estimated at an additional $100,000. Further savings were made through deals with labour unions in exchange for shares in MLGL. Construction began at midnight on June 1, 1931. In what is to this day considered to be a remarkable accomplishment, the Gardens was constructed in five months and two weeks at a cost of C$1.5 million ($ in dollars).

Team owner Harold Ballard lived in the owner&#x27;s suite built into the arena&#x27;s top northeast corner.

===The Conn Smythe era: 1931–1960===

The Gardens opened on November 12, 1931, with the Maple Leafs losing 2–1 to the Chicago Black Hawks. The reported attendance on opening night was 13,542. The Leafs would go on to win their first Stanley Cup as the Maple Leafs that season (they had already won two previously—one as the Toronto Arenas and one as the Toronto St. Patricks).

The first professional wrestling show at the Gardens was held on November 19, 1931, and attracted 15,800 people to see world champion Jim Londos in the main event. The show was promoted by Jack Corcoran, who passed the reins to Frank Tunney and his Maple Leaf Wrestling promotion in 1939. Under Tunney, Toronto and the Gardens was a thriving centre for professional wrestling for decades. Local hero Whipper Billy Watson became the city&#x27;s top wrestling attraction in the 1940s and 1950s. The last WWE-promoted event at Maple Leaf Gardens was on September 17, 1995. Boxing was also a regular offering at the Gardens for many years. The first world title fight in the building was on September 19, 1932, with bantamweight champion Panama Al Brown knocking out challenger Émile Pladner in the first round.

Winston Churchill addressed a large audience at the Gardens in March 1932; when the arena&#x27;s loudspeaker system broke down, he tossed the microphone to one side, declared &quot;Now that we have exhausted the resources of science, we shall fall back upon Mother Nature and do our best,&quot; and continued.

Victory Loan rallies were held at the Gardens during World War II.

Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) secretary W. A. Hewitt served as the managing director of Maple Leaf Gardens from 1931 to 1948. When the Gardens opened, it served as the home rink for all Toronto-based teams in the OHA, except for the University of Toronto. The OHA regularly renewed lease agreements to keep the same arrangement.

On November 1, 1946, Maple Leaf Gardens was the site of the first game in the history of the Basketball Association of America (later to become the NBA), with the Toronto Huskies playing the New York Knickerbockers. The Huskies played their last game at the Gardens on March 28, 1947, and the franchise folded shortly after that. In the 1946–47 NHL season, Maple Leaf Gardens was the first arena in the NHL to have Plexiglas inserted in the end zones of the rink.

Smythe became the majority owner of Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. in 1947, following a power struggle between directors who supported him as president and those who wanted him replaced with Frank J. Selke. Toronto stock broker Percy Gardiner lent Smythe the money he needed to take control of the corporation. The loan was paid off in 1960.

Beginning with the Canadian Grand Opera&#x27;s production of &quot;Faust&quot; in 1936, the Gardens became home to more highbrow forms of entertainment. The Metropolitan Opera staged several of its visiting productions there between 1952 and 1960. The first rock and roll concert at the Gardens was held in 1956, featuring Bill Haley &amp; His Comets. Elvis Presley&#x27;s shows at the Gardens on April 2, 1957, were his first-ever concerts outside the United States. The Gardens also hosted evangelist Billy Graham during his &quot;Canadian Crusade&quot; in 1955.

===Smythe-Ballard-Bassett in partnership: 1961–1971===

In 1961, Smythe sold most of his shares to a three-person partnership formed by his son, Stafford Smythe, with Harold Ballard and John W. H. Bassett. The new ownership added 962 new seats to the Gardens in 1962 and added a private club, The Hot Stove Club, the following year. Even more seats were added in 1965, and new mezzanine galleries were constructed in 1966 and 1967. By 1968, seating capacity for hockey had grown to 16,485. This was achieved, in part, by making the seats narrower, so that—in the words of founder Conn Smythe—&quot;only a young man could sit in them and only a fat old rich man could afford them.&quot; A large portrait of Queen Elizabeth II was removed to accommodate more seats. When asked why he removed the picture, Ballard replied, &quot;She doesn&#x27;t pay me; I pay her. Besides, what the hell position can a queen play?&quot;

The Leafs were so popular the team sold out every game from 1946 to 1999. It was often called the &quot;Carlton Street Cashbox&quot; in sports reporting. Advertising was sold and placed throughout the building.

On November 8, 1963, Maple Leaf Gardens would be the first arena in the NHL to have separate penalty boxes. The Beatles made a stop at Maple Leaf Gardens during each of their three North American tours: September 7, 1964, August 17, 1965, and August 17, 1966. It was the only venue to host the group on each tour.

In March 1966, Conn Smythe resigned from the board of directors after a Muhammad Ali boxing match was scheduled for the Gardens. He found Ali&#x27;s comments about the Vietnam War to be offensive and said that by accepting the fight, Gardens owners had &quot;put cash ahead of class.&quot; 
Also in 1966, a new centre-hung scoreboard with a digital clock was installed, replacing the SporTimer, which was an analog clock. One of the designers of the new scoreboard, Paul Morris, was by this time the arena&#x27;s public address announcer, a job he would hold until the Leafs left the arena.

Ballard and the younger Smythe were accused in 1969 of stealing money from the corporation and avoiding income taxes by having Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. pay for many of their personal expenses. The controversy created a rift between the two and Bassett, which led to Smythe and Ballard being fired from their management positions in 1969, only to win back control the following year. In September 1971, Bassett sold his shares to Stafford Smythe and Ballard. Just six weeks later, Smythe died. His brother and son tried to keep the shares within the Smythe family, but in February 1972, Ballard purchased all of Smythe&#x27;s shares, leaving him with majority ownership of the building and the Leafs.

===Harold Ballard takes control: 1972–1990===

On July 7, 1974, the arena hosted a Professional wrestling tournament called World Cup Wrestling. Various International stars competed in like Dara Singh, Pat Roach, Danny Lynch, Tiger Jeet Singh, Prince Mann Singh, Randhawa, Than Yen Chang, Majid Ackra, Kashmir Singh, Tony Parisi, Chris Tolos, Golden Boy Apollo, and Terry Yorkston etc. In the main event match, world champion Dara Singh defeated Danny Lynch and retained his title.

Concert Promotions International was founded in 1973 by Bill Ballard with Michael Cohl and David Wolinksy and brought many big-name music acts to the Gardens. The arena played host to The Rolling Thunder Revue Tour, with two consecutive shows, on December 1–2, 1975, headed by Bob Dylan. Bob Marley and The Wailers performed here on June 9, 1978, and November 1, 1979, in support of his Kaya Tour 1978 and Survival Tour 1979, respectively. The Bee Gees performed here on August 31, 1979. ABBA played here on Sunday, October 7, 1979, their last-ever concert appearance in North America. The Who performed at the Gardens on October 21, 1976, marking their final concert with drummer Keith Moon with a paying audience. The Who returned to the venue in December 1982 for the final show of what was originally intended to be their farewell tour. The Jacksons performed here on August 5, 1981, during their Triumph Tour. The video for &quot;The Reflex&quot; by Duran Duran was shot at Maple Leaf Gardens in March 1984. Toronto rock trio Rush recorded a live video for their Grace Under Pressure Tour at Maple Leaf Gardens. The arena played host to Amnesty International&#x27;s legendary Human Rights Now! Benefit Concert on September 15, 1988. The show was headlined by Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band and also featured Sting, Peter Gabriel, Tracy Chapman, Youssou N&#x27;Dour and k.d. lang. Pearl Jam performed at the arena on September 21, 1996 (the only Canadian date on the tour). From 1973 until the closing of Maple Leaf Gardens CPI brought the top rock and pop acts to Maple Leaf Gardens.

The Leafs continued to sell out every game through the Ballard era, even as the team&#x27;s performance went into steep decline. It was during this time that disgruntled fans gave the arena its unaffectionate nickname of &quot;The Carlton Street Cash Box.&quot; The rink-side red seats were replaced with gold seats in 1974. In August 1979, to make room for private boxes, Ballard had his staff tear down the 48-year-old gondola from which Foster Hewitt regularly broadcast games across Canada and threw it into an incinerator. In an editorial, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; called Ballard&#x27;s actions the &quot;barbaric destruction of one of Canada&#x27;s great cultural monuments.&quot; Then, in 1982, the centre-hung scoreboard that had been in use since 1966 was replaced by a new centre-hung scoreboard with a colour matrix message/animation screen on each side, which remained in use for the rest of the Maple Leafs&#x27; stay at the Gardens. Originally an American Sign and Indicator scoreboard, it was upgraded by Daktronics in the 1990s.

Prior to the launch of the Ottawa Nationals of the World Hockey Association (WHA), the team had discussions with Ballard about locating the team in Toronto. Still, the talks did not get very far. The team was a flop at the box office, averaging about 3,000 fans a game, and in March 1973—just before the end of the season—the City of Ottawa demanded payment of $100,000 to guarantee the club dates at the Ottawa Civic Centre. The team decided to leave Ottawa and played their home playoff games at Maple Leaf Gardens, attracting crowds of 5,000 and 4,000 in two games before being eliminated by the New England Whalers. At the end of the season, the team moved to Toronto permanently and was sold to John F. Bassett, son of former Leafs owner John Bassett. They were renamed the Toronto Toros in June 1973. Bassett wanted the team to play at a renovated CNE Coliseum. At the same time Bill Ballard—Harold&#x27;s son, who was running the Gardens while his father served a prison sentence—wanted the team at the Gardens and opposed the plan to upgrade the Coliseum. The Toros ended up at Varsity Arena for the 1973–74 season. In the following season, the Toros moved to the Gardens after negotiating a lease with Bill. However, by the time the team played their first game at the Gardens, Harold had been released from prison and regained control of the company. Ballard was a virulent opponent of the WHA; he never forgave the upstart league for decimating the Leafs&#x27; roster in the early 1970s. He made the Toros&#x27; lease terms at the Gardens as onerous as possible. The Toros&#x27; lease called for them to pay $15,000 per game. However, much to Bassett&#x27;s outrage, the arena was dim for their first game. It was then that Ballard demanded $3,500 for the use of the lights. Ballard also denied the Toros access to the Leafs&#x27; locker room, forcing them to build their own at a cost of $55,000. He also removed the cushions from the home bench for Toros&#x27; games. Following two seasons of declining attendance and onerous lease terms at the Gardens, Bassett moved the club to Birmingham, Alabama and renamed them the Birmingham Bulls for the 1976–77 season.

====Sexual abuse====
In 1997, allegations began to emerge that some employees of the Gardens had sexually abused young boys in the 1970s and 1980s. Martin Kruze was the first victim to come forward—contacting the new owners of Maple Leaf Gardens in 1993 and going public in February 1997. His story of abuses beginning in 1975 prompted dozens of other victims to come forward. In October 1997, Gordon Stuckless pleaded guilty to sexually abusing 24 boys dating back to 1969 and was sentenced to a jail term of two years less a day. Three days later, Kruze committed suicide. An appeals court later increased Stuckless&#x27; sentence to five years. He was paroled in 2001. In 1999, former usher John Paul Roby was convicted of sexually molesting 26 boys and one girl. He was subsequently declared a dangerous offender and could have been kept in prison for the rest of his life. Roby died in Kingston Penitentiary from an apparent heart attack in 2001. In 2002, former Gardens security guard Dennis Morin was found guilty of sexual assault, indecent assault and gross indecency for incidents involving teenage boys. Allegations—unproven in court—were also made against other Gardens employees, including Ballard. Several civil suits were settled out of court for undisclosed amounts. In January 2006, the Ontario government filed a $1.5 million lawsuit against Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment Ltd., seeking repayment of the medical costs to the province of treating the sex abuse victims. Stuckless later died on April 9, 2020, after suffering a brain hemorrhage a few nights before.

===The final years and move to Bay Street: 1991–2003===

Ballard died in April 1990. The executors of his will were Steve Stavro, Donald Crump and Don Giffin. In 1991, Stavro paid off a $20 million loan that had been made to Ballard in 1980 by Molson. In return, he was given an option to buy Gardens shares from Ballard&#x27;s estate. Molson also agreed to sell its stake in Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. to Stavro. That deal closed in 1994, and shortly after, Stavro bought Ballard&#x27;s shares from the estate for $34 a share or $75 million. The purchase was the subject of a securities commission review and a lawsuit from Ballard&#x27;s son Bill Ballard. However, the deal stood, and Stavro and his partners in MLG Ventures became the new owner of the Maple Leafs and Maple Leaf Gardens.

MLG Ventures took Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. private, and the two corporations amalgamated. becoming Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment Ltd. after its acquisition of the Toronto Raptors in 1998. Initially, the majority owner of MLSE, holding 51% of the company, was MLG Holdings, a corporation controlled by Stavro, with minority shareholders Larry Tannenbaum (25%) and Toronto-Dominion Bank (20%). The other 49% of MLSE was owned by Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan. In 2003, Stavro sold his shares and MLG Holdings was dissolved, leaving Teachers&#x27; as majority owners of MLSE.

During the 1990s, MLSE considered a number of sites for a new, modern arena to replace Maple Leaf Gardens, including the southeast corner of Bay and Dundas Streets near the Toronto Eaton Centre (the current site of the Toronto Metropolitan University School of Business). By this time, Maple Leaf Gardens was considered too small and lacking in revenue-generating luxury boxes.

The Leafs had no plans to occupy the Air Canada Centre, then under construction by the owners of the Toronto Raptors, and it appeared for a time as though the stalemate between the two sports franchises would result in two new arenas being constructed in Toronto – one for hockey, one for basketball. When MLSE acquired the Toronto Raptors, however, the Air Canada Centre, which was still under construction, was retrofitted to accommodate both hockey and basketball.

The Raptors played their final game at the Gardens on February 9, 1999. A few days later, on February 13, 1999, the Toronto Maple Leafs ended a 67-year tradition when they played their last game at Maple Leaf Gardens, suffering a 6–2 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks. Former Leaf Doug Gilmour scored a fluke goal in that game, and the notorious tough guy Bob Probert scored the final NHL goal in MLG history during the third period. During the emotional post-game ceremony, legendary Canadian singer Anne Murray performed &quot;The Maple Leaf Forever&quot;, clad in a Leafs jersey along with numerous former Maple Leaf Players dating back to 1931 when the arena opened up, a banner was brought into the ice commemorating the 13 Stanley Cups the Maple Leafs won since the arena did not have championship banners hanging at the time.

Nirvana played a show on their In Utero Tour on November 4, 1993. Oasis was the final musical artist to play at the venue on April 29, 2000.

The Gardens was the home arena for the Toronto Rock of the National Lacrosse League for the 1999 and 2000 seasons. The Rock won the Champion&#x27;s Cup in both seasons, making them the building&#x27;s last championship team. The 2000 NLL Championship game was ultimately the building&#x27;s last professional event held at MLG. They had a training camp at the Gardens in 2001 and then moved to the ACC. Maple Leaf Gardens was then mostly dormant for a decade.

===Loblaws and Ryerson/TMU (2004–present)===
MLSE refused to sell Maple Leaf Gardens to anyone who proposed to use it as an arena in competition with the Air Canada Centre. Among these turned down was Eugene Melnyk, owner of the Toronto St. Michael&#x27;s Majors OHL hockey team and the Maple Leafs&#x27; rival team, the Ottawa Senators. Various redevelopment schemes were proposed, most notably an entertainment complex containing retail shops and cinemas (similar to the redevelopment of the Montreal Forum). Still, these plans were abandoned when it was discovered that the tiered arena seating was holding up the exterior walls of the building, acting as a form of interior flying buttress. If the bowl of seating were removed, the exterior walls would lose most of their support.

Loblaw Companies, Canada&#x27;s largest food retailer, purchased the Gardens in 2004 for $12 million under the condition that it not be used as a sports and entertainment facility. However, MLSE eventually consented to allowing a small arena to be restored in the building. They were planning to convert the interior to accommodate a Real Canadian Superstore (now Loblaws instead of RCSS) and parking. Immediately, there was criticism that the conversion of the building to retail uses diminished its heritage value and that Maple Leaf Gardens should continue to serve as an arena in accordance with its rich history and traditions. Others, however, noted the structure had been deteriorating for several years, and its ongoing use for minor league sports and events would not generate sufficient income to secure the building&#x27;s preservation and restoration. Furthermore, the active re-use of the building would allow it to remain open to the public for years to come.

Needing an authentic stand-in for New York&#x27;s third Madison Square Garden during the Depression Era, the producers shot the boxing sequences of &quot;Cinderella Man&quot; (Russell Crowe and Renée Zellweger) at Maple Leaf Gardens in 2004. Maple Leaf Gardens was stripped of some of its outdoor signage for the production of an episode of Canadian-produced &quot;Flashpoint&quot;. The arena was named &quot;The Godwin Coliseum&quot; in the episode titled &quot;Behind the Blue Line&quot; that originally aired on November 20, 2009.

On September 8, 2009, Matt Damon hosted a concert in support of the charity ONEXONE. It was the first concert at Maple Leaf Gardens in 8 years. The arena was used on May 8, 2009, for the International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association&#x27;s convention tradeshow. Also in 2009, the arena was used as the venue for the first season of &quot;Battle of the Blades&quot;, a CBC-produced reality competition pairing former NHL hockey players with professional figure skaters in a pairs figure skating competition.

In 2009, Loblaws announced it had entered into discussions with Toronto Metropolitan University, then known as Ryerson University, regarding the possible future joint use of the arena. On November 30, 2009, the federal government agreed to contribute $20 million as part of a $60 million project to renovate the arena into a Loblaws grocery store and a new athletic facility for TMU, which included a fitness facility, studios, high-performance courts, and an NHL-sized ice hockey rink seating approximately 2,796 guests. The plans involved gutting the existing interior and laying new floors for retail use at ground level, with the athletic centre located above. 

In early 2010, Loblaws invited five design agencies to pitch against each other. The brief was simple: “Create the best food store in the world.” Four of the five contenders were North American firms. However, surprisingly, a foreign team ended up scoring the job: Landini Associates, a multidisciplinary retail design and branding consultancy based in Sydney, Australia. 

Speaking about the project in a 2012 interview with Monocle Magazine, Creative Director Mark Landini said: 


The local firm Turner Fleischer was appointed alongside Landini as building architects. After many delays, including the discovery of a creek running through the basement and a time capsule behind the 1931 cornerstone on Carlton Street, the new store opened on November 30, 2011.

The new design incorporated many elements of Maple Leaf Gardens, including original stadium seats, a red dot on the ground floor marking the original centre ice location, the recreation of an original mural by the checkouts and a 12 x 12-metre maple leaf sculpture made out of old seats from the arena, among numerous other things. 
The centre also includes underground parking, a Joe Fresh, an LCBO liquor store and a medical clinic. It is the chain&#x27;s flagship location. 

The transformation went on to win numerous awards, including a World Architecture News Retail and Leisure Interiors Award in the &quot;Retail outlets over &quot; category.

==Mattamy Athletic Centre at the Gardens==

On November 29, 2011, Ryerson University (now Toronto Metropolitan University) announced that Peter Gilgan, Founder and chief executive officer, Mattamy Homes Ltd., contributed a donation of $15 million to the university. In honour of Gilgan, the new athletic complex was renamed Mattamy Athletic Centre at the Gardens. The ice rink, which is located on the third level, was named Mattamy Home Ice.

The athletic centre construction was completed in the summer of 2012, and the ice rink became the new home for the Ryerson Rams hockey team, now known as the TMU Bold. The first game took place on September 9, 2012, with the Rams taking a 5–4 victory over the University of Ontario Institute of Technology Ridgebacks. The arena is home to the TMU Bold hockey, basketball and volleyball teams.

During the Summer of 2012, the Canadian Lacrosse League announced the relocation of the Oshawa Machine to Toronto as the Toronto Shooting Stars. It was also announced that the team would play out of the Mattamy Athletic Centre, bringing Lacrosse back to the Gardens after a 13-year absence. The team held their first game on January 13, 2013. The pre-game honoured former Toronto Rock and Tomahawk players. The team played one season at the arena before folding.

During the 2012–13 NHL lockout the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA) used the arena for a charity game. In addition, from January 25 to 27, 2013, the Ontario Liberals used the Gardens for their leadership convention. The arena hosted the 2013 Players&#x27; Championship, a Capital One Grand Slam of Curling event. The facility also hosted the 2014 OUA Figure Skating Championships, won by the Guelph Gryphons.

On December 13–14, 2014, the arena was the host of two exhibition games between the Canada men&#x27;s national junior ice hockey team and a team University All Stars of combined Ryerson Rams, University of Toronto Varsity Blues and York Lions players in preparation for Canada&#x27;s participation in the 2015 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.

The arena, under the name Ryerson Athletic Centre, was one of the venues for the 2015 Pan American and Parapan American Games, hosting the basketball tournament of the 2015 Pan American Games, wheelchair basketball of the 2015 Parapan American Games and various events (Indoor rowing, powerlifting, sitting volleyball, wheelchair basketball and wheelchair rugby) for the 2017 Invictus Games.

On February 13, 2018, the arena hosted an open practice for the Maple Leafs. This marked the first official Leafs event in the building since the last Leafs game played there in 1999, nineteen years to the day.

Since opening in 2012, Mattamy Athletic Centre has hosted the 2015 CIS Men&#x27;s Basketball Championship, the 2017 U Sports Women&#x27;s Volleyball Championship and the 2019 U Sports Women&#x27;s Basketball Championship.

Mattamy Athletic Centre was chosen for the Overwatch League 2023 Grand Finals, which took place from late September to the start of October 2023.

In November 2023, it was announced that the Mattamy Athletic Centre would become the new home of the Toronto Sceptres. Toronto hosted the inaugural PWHL game on January 1, 2024, against the New York Sirens, who won the sold-out game by a score of 4–0.

==Recognition==

<text>Mihai Nadin (born February 2, 1938, in Braşov, Romania) is a scholar and researcher in electrical engineering, computer science, aesthetics, semiotics, human-computer interaction (HCI), computational design, post-industrial society, and anticipatory systems. His publications on these topics number over 200, and he has lectured throughout the world.

Currently Mihai Nadin is Professor Emeritus of Computer Science and Interactive Media and Former Ashbel Smith Professor in Interactive Arts, Technology, and Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas. He was director of the Institute for Research in Anticipatory Systems.

== Life ==
Born in Braşov, Romania, Nadin was educated under the communist regime imposed after World War II. He studied electrical engineering, telecommunications and computer science, as well as studying at the Polytechnic University of Bucharest. He took a Master of Science with honors. He studied philosophy at the University of Bucharest, receiving a Master of Arts; then received his doctoral degree with a specialization in aesthetics. He attended the Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich, studying for a post-doctoral degree (&quot;Habilitierung&quot;) with Professor Dr. Wolfgang Stegmüller in Philosophy, Logic, and the Theory of Science. His dissertation was entitled The &quot;Semiotic Foundation of Value Theory&quot;.

== Human-computer interaction ==
Nadin&#x27;s contributions to human-computer interaction (HCI) have a strong foundation in semiotics. Based on his work in Peircean semiotics and his training in computer science, Nadin was the first to recognize that the computer was the &quot;semiotic machine par excellence&quot;.

== Peircean semiotics ==
A conceptualist, Nadin&#x27;s first work in semiotics was rather on the theory than in application. Due to the interest of Europeans, especially of Germans under the aegis of Max Bense, Nadin was attracted to the work of the American polymath and philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce. Under the influence of Bense, Nadin&#x27;s early work in semiotics was dedicated to a rigorous foundation for the advancement of Peirce&#x27;s semiotic.

== Computers in education ==
At the Rhode Island School of Design, Nadin made a name for himself as one of the first proponents, in the nation, of integrating computers in education. He lectured on the topic around the US and consulted for several institutes of higher education (Rochester Institute of Technology, Illinois Institute of Technology, University of Oregon, Hadassah University in Israel, among others) in setting up programs in art and design with computers.

Prior to the widespread use of the Internet, Nadin developed several computer-aided educational aids. Docent, a HyperCard based software program, was integrated in the CD-ROM for interactive learning. Both Docent and MetaDocent were first developed for the videodisc medium. MetaDocent gave users the possibility to create individualized image/text files. The indexing of image, sound, navigation, and especially the possibility to produce an individualized record (through an integrated Notebook application) were unique at the time

Based on the fact that play is serious work for the very young, Nadin initiated a program in Toy Design at SUNY - Fashion Institute of Technology to train designers to develop the minds of the very young through all the senses. He also insisted on integrating the (then) new digital technology into toys for pre-school and school-age children so that they could experience the possibilities of digital technology beyond mere computer games.

== Computational design ==
Nadin has opposed the viewpoint that tools that are extensions of human physical abilities, like the computer, should be considered an extension of the human mind. He founded the world&#x27;s first program in Computational Design in 1994 at the University of Wuppertal (Germany). Its purpose was twofold: 1. development of a theory of computational design; 2. the design of products and processes through digital means. These products and processes themselves integrate digital technology (they are embedded systems). Thus, the program&#x27;s long-term goal is the constitution of the world of ubiquitous computing.

== Anticipation ==
Anticipation is the focus of Nadin&#x27;s most recent research. Parallel to the pioneering work of Robert Rosen regarding anticipatory systems, Nadin researched the anticipatory characteristics of the human mind and anticipatory behaviors. After research at Stanford University, he developed possibilistic models for market processes, auction models, and real-time radio-astronomy data processing.

He founded the antÉ - Institute for Research in Anticipatory Systems in 2002. In 2004, he brought it to the University of Texas at Dallas. A major project involving anticipatory systems is entitled Seneludens, which aims at maintaining anticipatory capabilities in the aging through the creation of virtual interactive environments.

antÉ lab-first known quantification of anticipatory characteristics

The antÉ Lab pursues the quantification of anticipatory characteristics pertinent to human activity, aging, performance evaluation.

In 2012 he founded the Study Group on Anticipation at the Hanse Wissenschaftskolleg/Hanse Institute for Advanced Study (Delmenhorst, Germany).

<text>Varsity Arena, located at 299 Bloor Street West, Toronto, Ontario is an indoor arena that opened on December 17, 1926, and is primarily home to the ice hockey teams of the University of Toronto, the Varsity Blues. It also hosted the Toronto Toros of the WHA from 1973 to 1974 and the Toronto Planets of the RHI in 1993. It is located beside Varsity Stadium.

One of the first indoor arenas to be built without pillars in the seating area blocking the line of sight, Varsity Arena sat close to 4,800 in double wooden chairs at the time of its construction. It was designed by Professor T. R. Loudon along with architects Messers. Pearson and Darling and had an interior volume of . Originally the floor under the ice surface consisted of iron pipes covered in sand.

The seating capacity was reduced to 4,116 by renovations in 1985–86, which expanded the ice sheet to professional standards and eliminated fire code violations that had been found in 1977. The current gross floor area is .

It is also the home of the University of Toronto Intramural hockey league, which comprises (as of the Winter term of 2006) of 46 men&#x27;s and eight women&#x27;s teams of varying skill levels (from recreational to near-varsity calibre) competing in six men&#x27;s and two women&#x27;s divisions. 

Prior to 2009, the university also used the arena to host examinations. 

The first goal in the arena was scored by future NHL player Dave Trottier of the Varsity Grads in a two-period exhibition game against the Varsity Blues on opening night.

<doc id="753521" wikidata="Q5156434" url="?curid=753521" title="Complemented lattice">
<text>In the mathematical discipline of order theory, a complemented lattice is a bounded lattice (with least element 0 and greatest element 1), in which every element &quot;a&quot; has a complement, i.e. an element &quot;b&quot; satisfying &quot;a&quot; ∨ &quot;b&quot; = 1 and &quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;b&quot; = 0.
Complements need not be unique.

A relatively complemented lattice is a lattice such that every interval [&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;], viewed as a bounded lattice in its own right, is a complemented lattice.

An orthocomplementation on a complemented lattice is an involution that is order-reversing and maps each element to a complement. An orthocomplemented lattice satisfying a weak form of the modular law is called an orthomodular lattice.

In bounded distributive lattices, complements are unique. Every complemented distributive lattice has a unique orthocomplementation and is in fact a Boolean algebra.

==Definition and basic properties==
A complemented lattice is a bounded lattice (with least element 0 and greatest element 1), in which every element &quot;a&quot; has a complement, i.e. an element &quot;b&quot; such that
::&quot;a&quot; ∨ &quot;b&quot; = 1     and    &quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;b&quot; = 0.

In general an element may have more than one complement. However, in a (bounded) distributive lattice every element will have at most one complement. A lattice in which every element has exactly one complement is called a uniquely complemented lattice

A lattice with the property that every interval (viewed as a sublattice) is complemented is called a relatively complemented lattice. In other words, a relatively complemented lattice is characterized by the property that for every element &quot;a&quot; in an interval [&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;] there is an element &quot;b&quot; such that
::&quot;a&quot; ∨ &quot;b&quot; = &quot;d&quot;     and    &quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;b&quot; = &quot;c&quot;.
Such an element &quot;b&quot; is called a complement of &quot;a&quot; relative to the interval. 

A distributive lattice is complemented if and only if it is bounded and relatively complemented. The lattice of subspaces of a vector space provide an example of a complemented lattice that is not, in general, distributive.

==Orthocomplementation==

An orthocomplementation on a bounded lattice is a function that maps each element &quot;a&quot; to an &quot;orthocomplement&quot; &quot;a&quot;⊥ in such a way that the following axioms are satisfied:
;Complement law: &quot;a&quot;⊥ ∨ &quot;a&quot; = 1 and &quot;a&quot;⊥ ∧ &quot;a&quot; = 0.
;Involution law: &quot;a&quot;⊥⊥ = &quot;a&quot;.
;Order-reversing: if &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; then &quot;b&quot;⊥ ≤ &quot;a&quot;⊥.
An orthocomplemented lattice or ortholattice is a bounded lattice equipped with an orthocomplementation. The lattice of subspaces of an inner product space, and the orthogonal complement operation, provides an example of an orthocomplemented lattice that is not, in general, distributive.

Boolean algebras are a special case of orthocomplemented lattices, which in turn are a special case of complemented lattices (with extra structure). The ortholattices are most often used in quantum logic, where the closed subspaces of a separable Hilbert space represent quantum propositions and behave as an orthocomplemented lattice.

Orthocomplemented lattices, like Boolean algebras, satisfy de Morgan&#x27;s laws:

* (&quot;a&quot; ∨ &quot;b&quot;)⊥ = &quot;a&quot;⊥ ∧ &quot;b&quot;⊥
* (&quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;b&quot;)⊥ = &quot;a&quot;⊥ ∨ &quot;b&quot;⊥.

==Orthomodular lattices==

A lattice is called modular if for all elements &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; the implication
::if &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;c&quot;, then &quot;a&quot; ∨ (&quot;b&quot; ∧ &quot;c&quot;) = (&quot;a&quot; ∨ &quot;b&quot;) ∧ &quot;c&quot;
holds. This is weaker than distributivity; e.g. the above-shown lattice &quot;M&quot;3 is modular, but not distributive. 

A natural further weakening of this condition for orthocomplemented lattices, necessary for applications in quantum logic, is to require it only in the special case &quot;b&quot; = &quot;a&quot;⊥. An orthomodular lattice is therefore defined as an orthocomplemented lattice such that for any two elements the implication
::if &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;c&quot;, then &quot;a&quot; ∨ (&quot;a&quot;⊥ ∧ &quot;c&quot;) = &quot;c&quot;
holds.

Lattices of this form are of crucial importance for the study of quantum logic, since they are part of the axiomisation of the Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics. Garrett Birkhoff and John von Neumann observed that the propositional calculus in quantum logic is &quot;formally indistinguishable from the calculus of linear subspaces [of a Hilbert space] with respect to set products, linear sums and orthogonal complements&quot; corresponding to the roles of &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot; and &quot;not&quot; in Boolean lattices. This remark has spurred interest in the closed subspaces of a Hilbert space, which form an orthomodular lattice.

<text>The Trade Descriptions Act 1968 (c. 29) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which prevents manufacturers, retailers or service industry providers from misleading consumers as to what they are spending their money on.
This law empowers the judiciary to punish companies or individuals who make false claims about the products or services that they sell.

Applying a false trade description to goods is a strict liability offence: provided it is shown that the description was applied and was false, the accused has to prove certain defences in order to escape conviction.

False descriptions as to services require the more normal proof of &quot;mens rea&quot; (guilty intent).

The act excludes matters relating to land and buildings, which were dealt with under the provisions of the Property Misdescriptions Act 1991.

==Changes==
The act was in conflict with the EU Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, which has been adopted in the UK and was implemented from April 2008.

Although technically the act itself remains in force, most of its specific provisions were repealed and superseded by the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 which came into force 26 May 2008, missing the EU deadline for implementation by 12 June 2007. The repeals and revocations for TDA 1968 are sections 1(1), 5 to 10, 13 to 15, 19(4)(b) and (c), 21(1) and (2), 22, 24(3), 32, 37, and 39(2).

<text>ARCO Arena (known as Power Balance Pavilion from 2011 to 2012 and Sleep Train Arena from 2012 until 2022) was an indoor arena located in Sacramento, California, United States. Opened in 1988, it was the home of the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1988 to 2016. It hosted nearly 200 spectator events each year. The arena was named for ARCO, at the time in 1988, a Los Angeles–based independent oil and gas company that today is now a brand owned by Findlay, Ohio–based Marathon Petroleum. It was later named for Sleep Train, a chain of mattress and bed retailers based in Rocklin, California, that at the time of the agreement was a subsidiary of Mattress Firm, a Houston-based retailer that has since re-branded all Sleep Train stores as Mattress Firm. Several major entertainers have performed at the venue, including Bruno Mars and Linkin Park.

==History==
The original ARCO Arena, where the Kings played their home games for three seasons (1985–1988) after moving from Kansas City, had a capacity of 10,333 seats. It was located at 1625 North Market, and is now a mixed-use office building.

This arena was also the home for the Sacramento Attack of the Arena Football League in 1992, their only season, the WNBA&#x27;s Sacramento Monarchs until they folded in 2009 and the Sacramento River Rats of Roller Hockey International.

ARCO Arena was located in a once isolated area on the expanding northern outskirts of the city. It was constructed at a cost of just $40 million, the lowest of any venue in the NBA. It was the smallest arena in the NBA with a seating capacity of 17,317, and had 30 luxury suites and 412 club seats. It hosted such varied events as concerts, ice shows, rodeos and monster truck rallies. At one time, nearly two million spectators from throughout Northern California visited ARCO Arena in a year. The configuration for ice shows and ice hockey actually ran perpendicular to the basketball court with the normal sideline seating being retractable to allow for an international standard ice rink.

The arena was never intended to be a long-term facility – being a relic of the 1980s, it lacked a lot of amenities found later in more modern stadiums, like digital signage, spacious locker rooms, and wide concourses. NCAA cited that the arena was not adequate for college basketball (let alone the NBA), prompting plans to build a new facility.

LeBron James, the NBA&#x27;s all-time leading scorer, made his career regular season debut with the Cleveland Cavaliers at the arena on October 29, 2003. Despite losing the game to the Sacramento Kings, James scored 25 points. 

In 2006, there was a campaign to build a new $600 million facility in downtown Sacramento, which was to be funded by a quarter cent sales tax increase over 15 years; voters overwhelmingly rejected ballot measures Q and R, leading to the NBA publicly calling for a new arena to be built at another well-known Sacramento facility, Cal Expo, the site of California&#x27;s state fair.

The original namesake sponsor of the arena was ARCO. On March 19, 2007, the Maloof brothers announced a multi-year agreement extending the naming rights of ARCO Arena. ARCO&#x27;s sponsorship agreement ran out in February 2011. The arena was renamed Power Balance Pavilion on March 1, 2011, for its new sponsor, Power Balance, a manufacturer of sports wristbands. On October 15, 2012, the arena assumed its final name when The Sleep Train purchased the naming rights.

The arena&#x27;s center-hung scoreboard was designed as a joint venture between Panasonic and White Way Sign. Originally it contained four LCD video screens (one on each side) plus enough room for two players&#x27; stats on each team; as pro basketball grew in popularity, the scoreboard was upgraded in 1991 so that stats for five players on each team could be shown; the original video screens were replaced a decade later with Panasonic Astrovision LED video screens.

The last Kings home game at Sleep Train Arena was on April 9, 2016, a 114–112 win against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The last points scored in the arena were two free throws by the Kings&#x27; Rudy Gay with one second left to clinch the game for the Kings.

The last ticketed event at Sleep Train Arena was the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus on September 19, 2016. The circus also opened the arena back in 1988. The last planned non-ticketed event was Sacramento State&#x27;s winter commencement ceremonies on December 17, 2016.

In November 2018, officials from the Sacramento Zoo explored the possibility of moving the zoo to the ARCO Arena site, citing the need for more space and the constraints of their current location at William Land Park; however, the Kings, who control the arena site, have conflicting plans to replace the arena with a mixed-use development with of commercial space and 2,000 residential units.

Once closed, the arena still hosted occasional events such as conferences and swap meets. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses used the arena for an extended stay in 2019. In April 2020, state health officials announced that the Sleep Train Arena would be converted into a temporary hospital in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in California.

In June 2021, the Sacramento Kings and the City of Sacramento announced that the site had been donated to California Northstate University, and that a medical school and hospital will be built there. On March 19, 2022, the Sacramento Kings hosted the final ever event at the arena, reverting to the original ARCO Arena name for a free farewell event attended by thousands of fans and Kings personnel/alumni. Fans were allowed to enter the arena, reminisce about their memories there, and say their goodbyes before the arena&#x27;s impending demolition. Demolition plans were formally submitted to the City of Sacramento, and after an environmental hold on the demolition plans went through. The demolition process began on August 9, 2022, and was completed in October 2022. The site of the arena is still open to the public, although it is mostly abandoned; the parking lot is still the site of the Sacramento Antique Faire.

==Events==

===High school basketball===
ARCO Arena hosted several state high school basketball championship games (1992, 1996, 1998–2009, 2011–2014, 2016).

===College sports===
The arena also hosted NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournaments multiple times and was the host site for the 2007 NCAA Volleyball Championships.

===WWE===
ARCO Arena hosted several WWE events including the 1993 Royal Rumble, Judgment Day 2001, and The Bash in 2009.

===MMA===
ARCO Arena played host to four Ultimate Fighting Championship events: UFC 65, UFC 73, UFC on Fox: Johnson vs. Benavidez 2 and UFC 177. The arena hosted World Extreme Cagefighting&#x27;s first ever pay-per-view event, WEC 48, on April 24, 2010. It also hosted the WEC&#x27;s two biggest events ever, WEC 34, Faber vs. Pulver 1, and WEC 41, Brown vs. Faber 2, with an average of 1,300,500 viewers on Versus each. It also hosted WEC.

===Other events===
Other notable events include the five-day 1995 Billy Graham Greater Sacramento Crusade, which 177,000 people attended. A crowd of 47,500 people reportedly showed up on one night of the event, when Michael W. Smith was the musical guest; only 18,000 people were permitted inside and many watched on outside television screens.

ARCO Arena hosted many graduation celebrations for local high schools.

The arena hosted a PBR Built Ford Tough Series bull riding event every year from 2005 to 2016.

==ARCO Park==
ARCO Park was an unfinished multi-purpose stadium directly north of the arena. The original plan was to have a Triple–A minor-league baseball stadium adjacent to the basketball stadium. The stadium would have been capable of expansion to accommodate both a Major League Baseball team (possibly the Oakland Athletics) and a National Football League team (possibly the-then Los Angeles Raiders). However, the facility was never finished because the Sacramento Sports Association ran out of money during construction in 1989 and a team was never secured. A tunnel connecting the basketball arena to the unfinished stadium remained; the tunnel was colloquially known as the &quot;clown cave&quot;, as clowns from the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus used the tunnel as a dress and rehearsal space. With the closure of ARCO Arena and the subsequent redevelopment of the site into California Northstate University&#x27;s Medical Center Campus, the remnants of the cancelled stadium are likely to be demolished. In a rather ironic twist, the Oakland Athletics would eventually relocate to Sutter Health Park in West Sacramento (albeit temporarily) in 2024 while awaiting the construction of their new ballpark in Las Vegas in 2028.

==Popular culture==

There is an instrumental song called &quot;Arco Arena&quot; on the album &quot;Comfort Eagle&quot; by Sacramento band Cake. The band also released a version of the song with lyrics as a B-Side. The music video for Bell Biv DeVoe&#x27;s &quot;She&#x27;s Dope&quot; was filmed at the arena.

The arena set a Guinness World Record for loudest sports roar by reaching 126 decibels on November 15, 2013.

<text>Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn is a fictional character created by the twentieth-century American mystery writer Tony Hillerman. He is one of the two officers of the Navajo Tribal Police who are featured in a number of Hillerman&#x27;s novels. The other officer is Jim Chee.

== Character biography ==

===Personal life and education===
The mother of Joe Leaphorn was Anna Gorman. His maternal grandfather was Hosteen Klee Thlumie, called as Hosteen Klee by young Leaphorn. As a child, Leaphorn was told the stories of the Navajo way of life (&quot;Listening Woman&quot;) by Thlumie. He was educated in the lower grades near home on the reservation, but sent to boarding school for the higher grades. He attended college at Arizona State University, where he completed a master&#x27;s degree in anthropology, writing a thesis paper (&quot;Dance Hall of the Dead&quot;). In addition to anthropology, he has a lifelong interest in the many religions of American Indians and peoples of the world. In the earlier books of the series, Leaphorn is married to the love of his life, Emma. They have no children. Emma has survived an episode of cancer, but experiences a reoccurrence which she does not survive. Leaphorn is devastated.

Later, Leaphorn becomes attracted to an anthropologist named Louisa Bourebonette, whom he meets while working on a case in &quot;Coyote Waits&quot;. Leaphorn is always in love with Emma, but he enjoys Louisa&#x27;s sharp mind and her company.

Leaphorn lives in the Navajo capital of Window Rock, Arizona.

===Professional life===
Educated in assimilationist Indian boarding schools operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, he is not as well versed in Navajo rituals, though he has attended the usual ceremonies. He is fluent in Navajo and in English. In the first three novels of the series, he has no staff; he reports to Captain Largo in the Navajo Tribal Police and works with officers of other tribes and often with federal investigative agencies. Leaphorn&#x27;s approach to his cases is informed by some Navajo, or Diné, tradition, but also by Anglo-European logic.

Leaphorn holds a Navajo world view, with no expectation of heaven in the afterlife, instead a need to find his place in this life and lead his life well. He follows the rules of courtesy of the Navajo as to the ebb and flow of conversations, and his ability to handle demanding characters from the white world around him. In &quot;Talking God&quot;, the year following the death of his wife, Leaphorn has a Blessing Way ceremony done for him by Jim Chee, an event that both find beneficial.

In his career he works in a number of locations, including a brief stint training at the FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C. Five months before &quot;The Fallen Man&quot;, Leaphorn retires, and as part of the plot he gets a commission as a private investigator.

==Reception==
Several reviewers have praised Hillerman&#x27;s culturally sensitive depiction of the Leaphorn character. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; noted the &quot;quiet, wise presence of Leaphorn himself, unselfconsciously drawing on the best of two clashing cultures.&quot; Another Kirkus review praised &quot;Hillerman&#x27;s anything but wooden Indians and the way in which he informs their way of life with affection and dignity.&quot; Greg Herren wrote, &quot;what makes &quot;Skinwalkers&quot; so outstanding, for me, is that it takes the reader inside the world of the Navajo reservation&quot;.

<text>Triumph of the Nerds is a 1996 British/American television documentary, produced by John Gau Productions and Oregon Public Broadcasting for Channel 4 and PBS. It explores the development of the personal computer in the United States from World War II to 1995. It was first screened as three episodes between 14 and 28 April 1996 on Channel 4, and as a single programme on 16 December 1996 on PBS.

&quot;Triumph of the Nerds&quot; was written and hosted by Robert X. Cringely (Mark Stephens) and based on his 1992 book &quot;Accidental Empires.&quot; The documentary comprises interviews with important figures connected with the personal computer, including Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer, Paul Allen, Bill Atkinson, Andy Hertzfeld, Ed Roberts, and Larry Ellison. It also includes archival footage of Gary Kildall and commentary from Douglas Adams, the author of the science fiction series &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy.&quot; The title &quot;Triumph of the Nerds&quot; is a play on the title of the 1984 comedy &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot;.

Cringely followed the series with &quot;Nerds 2.0.1&quot; (titled &quot;Glory of the Geeks&quot; in the UK), a history of the Internet to 1998. In 2012, Cringely released the full interview that Steve Jobs gave in 1995 for &quot;Triumph of the Nerds&quot; as &quot;Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview.&quot;

==Reception and influence==
&quot;Triumph of the Nerds&quot; was a successful series and Cringely noted in a 1998 interview that it was &quot;a stalwart of [PBS] pledge drives all across America.&quot;

Steve Wozniak discussed the film on the letters portion of his official website stating: &quot;I liked &quot;Triumph of the Nerds&quot;. It was one of the best shows ever created of that kind. Everyone has the same opinion, so why ask me? I&#x27;m not a history expert and couldn&#x27;t tell you what it missed or got wrong, but it seemed extremely thorough and insightful.&quot;

Actor Noah Wyle has also stated that after initially resisting the role, he finally agreed to portray Steve Jobs in the 1999 film &quot;Pirates of Silicon Valley&quot; after viewing &quot;Triumph of the Nerds.&quot;

<text>The Belgian Revolution (, ) was the conflict which led to the secession of the southern provinces (mainly the former Southern Netherlands) from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and the establishment of an independent Kingdom of Belgium.

The people of the south were mainly Flemings and Walloons. Both peoples were traditionally Roman Catholic as contrasted with Protestant-dominated (Dutch Reformed) people of the north. Many outspoken liberals regarded King William I&#x27;s rule as despotic. There were high levels of unemployment and industrial unrest among the working classes.

On 25 August 1830, riots erupted in Brussels and shops were looted. Theatergoers who had just watched the nationalistic opera &quot;La muette de Portici&quot; joined the mob. Uprisings followed elsewhere in the country. Factories were occupied and machinery destroyed. Order was restored briefly after William committed troops to the Southern Provinces but rioting continued and leadership was taken up by radicals, who started talking of secession.

Dutch units saw the mass desertion of recruits from the southern provinces and pulled out. On September 27, a newly formed Provisional Government in Brussels declared independence and called for the election of a National Congress. King William refrained from future military action and appealed to the Great Powers. The resulting 1830 London Conference of major European powers recognized Belgian independence. Following the installation of Leopold I as King of the Belgians in 1831, King William made a belated attempt to reconquer Belgium and restore his position through a military campaign. This Ten Days&#x27; Campaign failed because of French military intervention. The Dutch accepted the decision of the London conference and Belgian independence in 1839 by signing the Treaty of London.

==United Kingdom of the Netherlands==

After the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, the Congress of Vienna created a kingdom for the House of Orange-Nassau, thus combining the United Provinces of the Netherlands with the former Austrian Netherlands to create a strong buffer state north of France; with the addition of those provinces the Netherlands became a rising power. When the United Kingdom insisted on retaining the former Dutch Ceylon and the Cape Colony, which it had seized while the Netherlands was ruled by Napoleon, the new Kingdom of the Netherlands was compensated with these southern provinces.

==Causes of the revolution==
The revolution was due to a combination of factors, the main one being the difference of religion (Catholic in today&#x27;s Belgium, Protestant in today&#x27;s Netherlands) and the general lack of autonomy given to the south.

Other important factors are
* The under-representation of today&#x27;s Belgians in the General Assembly (62% of the population for 50% of the seats) 
* Most of the institutions were based in the North and public burdens were unevenly distributed. Only one minister out of four was Belgian. There were four times as many Dutch people in the administration as Belgians. There was a general domination of the Dutch over the economic, political, and social institutions of the Kingdom;
* The public debt of the north (higher than the one of the south) had to be supported by the south as well. The original debts were initially of 1.25 billion guilders for the United Provinces and only 100 million for the South.
* The action of William I in the field of education (construction of schools, control of the competence of teachers and the creation of new establishments, creation of three State universities) placed it under the total control of the State, which displeased Catholic opinion.
* The contingent imposed on Belgium by the recruitment of militiamen was proportionally high, while the proportion of Belgians among the officers was low, the high staff being mainly composed of former officers of the French army or of the British army. Only one officer out of six would be from the South. Most Belgian soldiers were therefore commanded by officers who were not originally from the Southern Netherlands. Moreover, the Dutch language had become the sole language of the army of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1823/24, which was an additional grievance on the part of the francophone elites and the Walloon people who spoke Romance dialects.
* The unsatisfactory application of freedom of the press and freedom of assembly were considered by Belgian intellectuals as a means of control of the South by the North.
* Belgian merchants and industrialists complained about the free trade policy pursued from 1827 onwards. The separation of France had caused the industry of the South to lose a large part of its turnover. On the other hand, the colony of the East Indies was experiencing a long period of revolt and British products were competing with Belgian production. With the end of the continental blockade, the continent was invaded by cheap British products, appreciated by the North, still mainly agricultural, but which excluded the productions of the South.
* A linguistic reform in 1823 was intended to make Dutch the official language in the Flemish provinces. This reform was met with strong opposition from the upper classes who at the time were mostly French-speaking, whether they came from Flanders or Wallonia, but also from the Flemish speakers themselves, who at the time did not speak standard Dutch but their own dialects. On 4 June 1830, this reform was abolished.
* The conservatives in the northern Netherlands were pushing for only followers of the former (Protestant) State Church to be appointed to the government, while the Belgian conservatives wanted to re-establish Catholicism as the state religion in Belgium. The coexistence of two state religions throughout the kingdom was unacceptable to both sides. Until 1821 the government used the opposition of the Catholics to the Basic Law to maintain the Protestant character of the state apparatus through the appointment of civil servants. William I himself was a supporter of the German Lutheran tradition, according to which the sovereign is the head of the church. He wanted to counter the Pope&#x27;s authority over the Catholic Church. He wanted to be able to influence the appointment of bishops.

==&quot;Night at the opera&quot;==

Catholic partisans watched with excitement the unfolding of the July Revolution in France, details of which were swiftly reported in the newspapers. On 25 August 1830, at the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels, an uprising followed a special performance, in honor of William I&#x27;s birthday, of Daniel Auber&#x27;s &quot;La Muette de Portici&quot; &quot;(The Mute Girl of Portici)&quot;, a sentimental and patriotic opera set against Masaniello&#x27;s uprising against the Spanish masters of Naples in the 17th century. After the duet, &quot;Amour sacré de la patrie&quot;, (Sacred love of Fatherland) with Adolphe Nourrit in the tenor role, many audience members left the theater and joined the riots which had already begun. The crowd poured into the streets shouting patriotic slogans. The brawls and violence continued for several days, with protesters capturing key points in the city including the Parc de Bruxelles and the Palais de Bruxelles. The Belgian rebels began to organize and fortify their positions in preparation for further confrontations with Dutch forces. The following days saw an explosion of the desperate and exasperated proletariat of Brussels, who rallied around the newly created flag of the Brussels independence movement which was fastened to a standard with shoelaces during a street fight and used to lead a counter-charge against the forces of Prince William.
William I sent his two sons, Crown-Prince William and Prince Frederik to quell the riots. William was asked by the Burghers of Brussels to come to the town alone, with no troops, for a meeting; this he did, despite the risks. The affable and moderate Crown Prince William, who represented the monarchy in Brussels, was convinced by the Estates-General on 1 September that the administrative separation of north and south was the only viable solution to the crisis. His father rejected the terms of accommodation that Prince William proposed. King William I attempted to restore the established order by force, but the 8,000 Dutch troops under Prince Frederik were unable to retake Brussels in bloody street fighting (23–26 September). The army was withdrawn to the fortresses of Maastricht, Venlo, and Antwerp, and when the Northern commander of Antwerp bombarded the town, claiming a breach of a ceasefire, the whole of the Southern provinces was incensed. Any opportunity to quell the breach was lost on 26 September when a National Congress was summoned to draw up a Constitution and the Provisional Government was established under Charles Latour Rogier. The Provisional Government then issued a Declaration of Independence on 4 October 1830.

==The European powers and an independent Belgium==

On 20 December 1830 the London Conference of 1830 brought together five major European powers: Austria, the United Kingdom, France, Prussia and Russia. At first, the European powers were divided over the Belgian cry for independence. The Napoleonic Wars were still fresh in the memories of the major European powers, so once the French, under the recently installed July Monarchy, supported Belgian independence, the other European powers unsurprisingly supported the continued union of the provinces of the Netherlands. Russia, Prussia, Austria, and the United Kingdom all supported the Netherlands, since they feared that the French would eventually annex an independent Belgium (particularly the British: see Flahaut partition plan for Belgium). However, in the end, none of the European powers sent troops to aid the Dutch government, partly because of rebellions within some of their own borders (the Russians were occupied with the November Uprising in Poland and Prussia was saddled with war debt). Britain would come to see the benefits of isolating France geographically with the new creation of a new Belgian buffer state between France, the Netherlands and Prussia.

==Accession of King Leopold==


In November 1830, the National Congress of Belgium was established to create a constitution for the new state. The Congress decided that Belgium would be a popular, constitutional monarchy. On 7 February 1831, the Belgian Constitution was proclaimed. However, no actual monarch yet sat on the throne.

The Congress refused to consider any candidate from the Dutch ruling house of Orange-Nassau. Eventually the Congress drew up a shortlist of three candidates, all of whom were French. This itself led to political opposition, and Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, who had been considered at an early stage but dropped due to French opposition, was proposed again. On 22 April 1831, Leopold was approached by a Belgian delegation at Marlborough House to officially offer him the throne. At first reluctant to accept, he eventually took up the offer, and after an enthusiastic popular welcome on his way to Brussels, Leopold I of Belgium took his oath as king on 21 July 1831.

21 July is generally used to mark the end of the revolution and the start of the Kingdom of Belgium. It is celebrated each year as Belgian National Day.

==Post-independence==

===Ten Days&#x27; Campaign===
King William was not satisfied with the settlement drawn up in London and did not accept Belgium&#x27;s claim of independence: it divided his kingdom and drastically affected his Treasury. On 2 August 1831 the Dutch army, headed by the Dutch princes, invaded Belgium, in what became known as the &quot;Ten Days&#x27; Campaign&quot; On 4 August the Dutch force took control of Antwerp and moved deeper into Belgium. 
The Belgian army of the Meuse was defeated in the battle of Hasselt. On 8 August Leopold called for support from the French and the British. As a result Marshal Étienne Maurice Gérard crossed the border with 70,000 French troops under his command on 9 August.

The battle of Leuven (where King Leopold had placed his headquarters) began on 12 August. In order to avoid war with the approaching French the Dutch agreed an armistice with Belgium and withdrew after briefly taking control of the city. While the victorious initial campaign gave the Dutch an advantageous position in subsequent negotiations, the Dutch were compelled to agree to an indefinite armistice, although they continued to hold the Antwerp Citadel and occasionally bombarded the city from it. Gerard returned to Belgium in November 1832 with the &quot;Armée du Nord&quot; and besieged the citadel taking it on 23 December 1832. William I would refuse to recognize a Belgian state until April 1839, when he had to yield under pressure by the Treaty of London and reluctantly recognized a border which, with the exception of Limburg and Luxembourg, was basically the border of 1790.

===1839 Treaty of London===

On 19 April 1839 the Treaty of London signed by the European powers (including the Netherlands) recognized Belgium as an independent and neutral country comprising West Flanders, East Flanders, Brabant, Antwerp, Hainaut, Namur, and Liège, as well as half of Luxembourg and Limburg. The Dutch army, however, held onto Maastricht, and as a result, the Netherlands kept the eastern half of Limburg and its large coalfields.

Germany broke the treaty in 1914 when it invaded Belgium on 4 August and dismissed British protests over a &quot;scrap of paper&quot;. Britain declared war on Germany the same day.

===Orangism===

As early as 1830 a movement started for the reunification of Belgium and the Netherlands, called Orangism (after the Dutch royal color of orange), which was active in Flanders and Brussels. But industrial cities, like Liège, also had a strong Orangist faction. The movement met with strong disapproval from the authorities. Between 1831 and 1834, 32 incidents of violence against Orangists were mentioned in the press and in 1834 Minister of Justice Lebeau banned expressions of Orangism in the public sphere, enforced with heavy penalties.

== Anniversary remembrances ==

===Cinquantenaire (50th anniversary)===
The golden jubilee of independence set up the Cinquantenaire park complex in Brussels.

===175th anniversary commemoration===
In 2005, the Belgian revolution of 1830 was depicted in one of the highest value Belgian coins ever minted, the 100 euro &quot;175 Years of Belgium&quot; coin. The obverse depicts a detail from Wappers&#x27; painting &quot;Scene of the September Days in 1830&quot;.

<doc id="753572" wikidata="Q486545" url="?curid=753572" title="Taraz">
<text>Taraz ( ; also historically known as Talas) is a city and the administrative center of Jambyl Region in Kazakhstan, located on the Talas (Taraz) River in the south of the country near the border with Kyrgyzstan. It had a population of 330,100 as of the 1999 census, up 9% from 1989, making it one of the fastest-growing cities in the country, after Astana and Turkistan. The current population of Taraz is 428,000 (April 2023).

One of the oldest cities in Kazakhstan and in Transoxania, built and populated by the ancient Sogdians, Taraz celebrated its official 2,000th anniversary (recognized by UNESCO) in 2001, dating from a fortress built in the area by a Xiongnu Chanyu named Zhizhi, and was a site of the Battle of Zhizhi in 36 BCE. The city was first recorded under the name &quot;Talas&quot; in 568 CE by Menander Protector. The medieval city of Talas was a major trade center along the Silk Road. Talas was later described by Buddhist monk and traveller Xuanzang, who passed Talas in 629 and later wrote: &quot;Traveling westward from the Thousand Springs 140 or 150 li, we come to the city of Daluosi. The city is 8 or 9 li in diameter; and was settled by Hu (&quot;foreign, barbarian, non-Chinese&quot;) merchants from various nations. The products and the climate are about the same as Suyab.&quot; The Talas alphabet, a variant of the Turkic &quot;runiform&quot; Orkhon script, is named for the town.

Talas secured a place in history by virtue of the Battle of Talas (751 CE), which was fought between forces of the Chinese Tang dynasty and those of the Arab Abbasid Caliphate. The battle took place somewhere along the Talas River in the Talas valley. One of its indirect outcomes was the introduction of paper to the West, via the Arab capture of Chinese paper makers.

==History==

===Overview===
Numerous archaeological finds and monuments in the foothills of Karatau and in Talas-Assin oasis show the antiquity of settlements in the Talas River valley, supporting Taraz&#x27;s claim to being the most ancient city in Kazakhstan. The history of the city is composed of several historical periods, interrupted by destruction and depopulation. The first reference historically recorded city linked with Taraz and the basis for the claim of 2000-year-old history is the fortress of Zhizhi that briefly existed at the site of modern-day Taraz in the 1st century BCE. A city known as &quot;Taraz&quot; (or &quot;Talas&quot;) is then recorded in the 6th century CE (568 CE) and is known to have existed until its decline in the 13th century. The third historical period begins with the establishment of a Kokand fortress at the end of the 18th century, which in 1864 was named Auliye-Ata (from the Uzbek words meaning &quot;saint&quot; and &quot;father&quot;). In 1936, the city was renamed Mirzoyan (Russian: ), after Levon Mirzoyan. After Mirzoyan&#x27;s arrest in 1938, the city was renamed to Dzhambul (Russian: ), after the Kazakh traditional folksinger Jambyl Jabayev (&quot;Dzhambul Dzhabayev&quot;). In 1993, the spelling of the city&#x27;s name was officially changed to Jambyl/Dzhambyl (Kazakh: , &quot;Jambyl&quot;), and in 1997 the city was renamed Taraz.

The city started to assume its present form when Colonel Chernyev&#x27;s detachment took over the Aulie Ata fortress and annexed it to the Russian Empire, starting in 1864. Taraz was greatly improved by the Semirechensky railway that passed through the town in 1917.

===Antiquity===

The discovery of chest ornaments, bronze statues of kings and remnants of ceramic products in separate parts of the Talas river valley are the evidence of the existence of the life in Taraz region in the bronze epoch. According to the archaeological excavation and available written sources, tribal unions of Saka Scythians had been formed in this territory by the 7th-8th centuries B.C.

Hanshu, 70 from 1st-century, talk about the fortress constructed on Talas River by Zhizhi Chanyu, a prince of Hun (Ch. Xiongnu, Hsiung-nu, etc.). The fortress is believed to have been at the site of modern Taraz.

===Medieval Taraz===

====Early references====

However, scarcity of information, inaccuracy of descriptions, and weakness of geography made it impossible to know the location until 1936. Professor Wilhelm Barthold&#x27;s research established that the location of ancient Taraz was under the Green Bazaar. Further research and archaeological excavations, which were made by an expedition of The USSR Academy of Science in 1938 under the supervision of A. Bernshtam and G. Patsevich to the depth 2–6 meters, made it possible to reconstruct the appearance and cultural–economic importance of ancient Taraz. The latest archaeological data have considerably expanded ideas about Taraz.

At that time the Great Silk Road ran across Southern Kazakhstan. It played a major role in trade and cultural exchange between China, India, Byzantium, and Persia. Taraz developed as a fortified tradecraft city on this massive transcontinental artery. Comparatively gentle climate, fertile soil and rich pastures attracted many stock-breeders and farmers. In the 60-s of the 6th century, the territory of the First Turkic Kaganate section included Taraz. The Sogdian merchants, who controlled the Central Asian section of the caravan route, were interested in easier access to Byzantium and initiated trade negotiations first with the Persians, and then with Byzantium. In response, Byzantium sent ambassadors to the Turkic Kaganate, and in the 568 the embassy led by Zemarchus and Maniach to the Muhan Khan arrived in Taraz at the court of Istemi Yabgu. The Persian ambassador also appeared at the court of the Turkic Kagan at the same time, but Istemi Yabgu allied with Byzantium.

Unfortunately, it is not illustrated in the written sources of that time what Taraz looked like but it is said to have been a big city. The Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang, who passed through Taraz in 630 came to the Ta-lo-se and noticed that the perimeter of the wall is 8 to 9 &quot;li&quot;(according to the Chinese measures one tang li is about 453 meters) in this city alternately. Due to written sources and archaeological investigation, it is known from the 1st BC to 5th AD Kangui (Kanglu) tribes lived in the Talas River Valley. Similarity between the excavated materials of Taraz and the Kurgans of the Gynskyi and Usunskyi-Kanguiskyi tribes show the introduction of Turkic language. Taraz was joined to the Western Turk Khanate. It felt, like other cities of the region, the influence of Sogdian culture.

Written sources of Paleo-Anthropological material collected from Kurgans in Southern Kazakhstan show the existence of close ties between Taraz and the Kypchaks, Qarluq populations of nearby valleys. As a result of an internecine struggle amongst Turkish tribal leaders at the beginning of the 8th century the Turkish tribe in the Ili River Valley was divided into two branches: Yellow and Black. The black (kara) Turkish owned the Talas River Valley and made Taraz their capital in the middle of the 7th century. In 751 in the Talas River region, upstream from the modern city of Taraz, an army comprising Tang Dynasty troops from China and Kara Turkish mercenaries fought an army from the Abbasid Caliphate. Despite winning the battle, the Caliphate forces withdrew from the region. In 766 the Kara-Turkish tribes were defeated by Qarlugs from the northwest. Later, nearly all the tribes of the former Western Turk Khanate were conquered.

The development of Taraz as a city arose as the result of the development and strengthening of political and economic ties linked to trade along the Silk Road. As a major halt, it flourished amidst a comparatively gentle climate, fertile soil and rich pastures, which attracted many stockbreeders and farmers. The struggle between Persia and Byzantium for control of the route forced both sides to look for allies. Byzantium sent ambassadors to the Western Turk Khanate, and Zemarkha Kililyskyi arrived in Taraz in 568. Simultaneously the Persians sent their ambassador to the Turks, but Istemi Khan was on the side of Byzantium.

====Islamic and Persian period====
This is the site of the &quot;Battle of Talas&quot;—first and the last military face-off between the Muslim Arab forces and the Chinese imperial troops in AD 750–51. After the Arab conquest of Central Asia in the 7th century and 8th century, the Persian Samanids occupied a major part of Central Asia in the 9th century. By this time Taraz, developing little by little had been a rich city-state typical of Central Asia with a large population and vast agricultural zone. In the late 9th century the Samanids extended their rule into the Steppes and captured Taraz (893), then one of the headquarters of the Karluk kaghan. A large church was transformed into a mosque, and according to one source, the &quot;Amir of Taraz&quot; embraced Islam. The Islamization of Central Asia was due in significant part to the activities of the Samanids, and in Taraz, other pre-existing religions such as Mazdaism, Christianity, Buddhism, and Tengrism were gradually replaced.

====The Karakhanids====
The Persian Samanids however were defeated by the Turkic Karakhanids who were a confederation of Karluks, Chigils, Yaghmas and other tribes. The Karakhanids were the first Turkic groups to have converted to Islam en masse, and from the 10th to 12th century Taraz was ruled by the Kara-Khanid Khanate as a Muslim state. Ancient Taraz reached the climax of its development in 11th-12th century under the Karakhanids. Instead of more or less centralized state like the Samanids, Karakhanid Central Asia was divided into many small fiefdoms or appanages. Taraz became an important centre. The political independence of Taraz and autonomy of the circle promoted their development. The power of the city under one of the rulers, Tugan-Khan, was so great that he independently waged a military campaign against Samarkand and temporarily captured it. Kashgar was invaded and it was under the Taraz&#x27;s power during 15 months. Certainly, this political power was the result of the economic importance of the city. In the Karakhanid Era the main part of Taraz, the Shahristan and Arg, did not grow beyond their sizes in the previous Qarluq-Samanid Era. The Arg lost its main significance in the city&#x27;s life. The Shahristan became the heart of the economic and cultural life of the city. It was there that all the military, administrative, cultural and other establishments that governed life in the medieval feudal city-state took place. At this time in the city and its countryside the mausoleums of Aisha-Bibi and Karakhan were built. Taraz had an underground water system made of terracotta pipes, paved streets, and sewage collection. Of great interest is the Taraz Banya, which was multiple-domed building built from fired brick. In due course, under the influence of internecine wars the Karakhanids lost their power and at the end of the 12th century the city was taken by the Kara-Khitans. In 1210 Kara-Khitans were defeated by Khwarazmshah Mohammed.

====Mongols====
Karakhanid rule did not last long because in 1220 nearly all Central Asia and the territory of modern Kazakhstan were invaded by Mongols. There were no written documents about Taraz&#x27;s growth under the Mongols after they razed it to the ground. Remnants of fire found during the excavation show that the city was burnt. Probably the town was renamed as Yany (&#x27;New&#x27;); while mentioning it, European and Arabic sources write &quot;The city Yany, named Taraz before the conquest.&quot; Archaeological finds show that the once-lively city under the Mongolian yoke lost its previous significance and independence. The blooming of settled life in Taraz ended and decline began. Under the Chagatayids (descendants of Chagatai Khan) coins were minted in Taraz until 1334. The Tsareviches, who, as Vasa of 14th century states, &quot;burnt the Golden Horde, destroyed Taraz and other cities, and killed the population. They took everything they could take and burnt the rest. There was a mention of the city again in 1345 in the road guidebook as a city laid on the trade route from Transoxiana to Almalyk.&quot; 
Steady internecine war in Central Asia interfered with the trade with distant countries, and the opening of the sea route from the Western European countries to India stopped the trade on the ancient silk road and led to the decline of the cities on this road.

====Kazakh rule====

Taraz is mentioned again in 1513 with the coming of the Kazakh tribes. The once famous medieval city and former capital had become a simple settlement, then it was forgotten, as well as its ancient name. By the 16th century the city&#x27;s territory had been absorbed into the Kazakh Khanate. The archaeological excavation shows Kazakh nomads were involved in the rebirth of Taraz with cultural links connecting the ancient medieval city with the culture of Kazakh people. The confirmation of it is the names of artificial channels stretched from the city. Under the Kazakh Khans in ancient Taraz there was just a small settlement, the inhabitants of which were engaged in craft, agriculture and cattle breeding. In 1723 the Talas Valley, as well as the major part of southern Kazakhstan were invaded by Dzungars who owned it nearly until 1755.

====Qing rule====
After the Dzungars were eliminated by Qing China in 1755, their entire territory, including Talas area, was annexed by the Qing, Qing soldiers patrolled the area once a year. Kazakh people were expelled from the area if they were captured pasturing inside the area.

As a result of the Dzungars&#x27; destruction the area became a No man&#x27;s land, Qing China had to deal with consistent cross-border immigration of Kazakh people. In 1766, the Qianlong Emperor ordered to accommodate Kazakh people in Talas area within the border and settled them properly. The area was promptly populated by Kazakhs. In fact, all of Xinjiang was populated by Kazakhs during the period as the aboriginal western Mongols were eliminated by the Qing in earlier years.

===From Auliye-Ata to Modern Taraz===

====A Kokand fortress====

In the beginning of the 19th century, the upper part of the Talas River Valley was again invaded by newcomers. This time it was the Qipchaq soldiers of the Khanate of Kokand. They built a few small fortresses for guarding the border and the caravan route mainly on the ancient cities ruins. Due to the comparatively advantageous position of the fortress which was built on the ruins of ancient Taraz a new town began quickly to grow around it. At first, it was named Namangan-i Kochek (&quot;little Namangan&quot;), as the first settlements were from the Persian-populated city Namangan, now in Uzbekistan and uzbekified. In 1856 it was renamed Aulie-Ata, in honor of Karakhan the founder of Karakhanid dynasty. Mullahs, using a legend about the mausoleum of Karakhan in 12th built a new mausoleum with minarets, which had nothing in common with the older one. This new mausoleum preserved the ancient name, &quot;Aulie-Ata&quot; (&quot;holy father&quot;). The town took the same name. By this time the city had become a considerable trade craft center. Annually, a large spring fair was held there. The products of craftsman and agriculture were changed for the things of cattle-breeders. Large consignments of livestock bought at the fair were sent to Tashkent and Fergana through the Karrabul Pass in the Talas-Alatau. The caravan way passed through the city to the north-through Akmolinsk (Astana) and Petropavlovsk (Petropavl), to Omsk.

====Russian rule====
In 1864, Aulie-Ata surrendered after a short siege by Russian forces led by General Mikhail Grigorievich Cherniaev. Soon the line of Russian fortifications across the steppe was connected through Chimkent with the Syr-Darya line. The whole part of this land was included in the Russian state. A new Russian quarter was added to old Aulie-Ata. Its streets were lined with pyramidal poplars, and new houses were built with brick. By that time there were 2,000-3,000 families with houses, shops, mansions, and small adobe houses of the poor. At first, it was ruled by a military administration, later in 1867 it became the center of an &quot;Uyezd&quot; occupying nearly all of the territory of the modern Jambyl Region of Kazakhstan and Talas Region of Kyrgyzstan. The city continued to play a great role in the livestock trade and in breeding. There appeared some small industrial undertakings, including wine-making. In 1876 the first school of a European type was opened by a Russian priest. At that time there were 11,700 inhabitants in the town – besides Russians and Ukrainians there were a lot of Uzbeks; Kazakhs were nearly absent, as they led a nomadic way of life. A full description of the city at the beginning of the 20th century is given in Russian.

The population consisted of Russians, Uzbeks and Kazakhs.

Ethnic composition of the city according to 1897 census:
*The total - 11,722.
*Uzbeks - 8,460 (72.1%).
*Russians (including Belarusians) - 1,366 (11.6%).
*Kirgiz Kaysak - 589 (5%).
*Sart (Tajik and Uzbek settlers from the Zarafshan oases) - 386 (3.2%).
*Tatars - 266 (2.2%).
*Tajik (Persian speaking merchants from the Fergana oases - 379 (3.2%).

===Soviet period===
During the first two decades following the Russian Revolution and the Civil War, Aulie-Ata remained a small town. It was renamed Mirzoyan (Russian: &quot;Мирзоян&quot;) in 1936, after Levon Mirzoyan (Левон Исаевич Мирзоян), an ethnic Armenian head of the Communists of Kazakhstan. In 1938, after Mirzoyan was executed during Stalin’s Great Purge for opposing the mass deportation of Koreans to northern Kazakhstan from the south, the city was renamed Dzhambul (Russian: &quot;Джамбул&quot;, Kazakh: &quot;Жамбыл&quot;) after Zhambyl Zhabayev, a Kazakh &quot;akyn&quot; (folk singer). Starting in the 1930s, Dzhambul, along with other places in Kazakhstan, became the destination for large numbers of the deported peoples who were subject to internal exile. Millions of Volga Germans, Chechens, Ukrainians, Koreans and other ethnic minorities, along with other marginalized subjects (former kulaks, members of the aristocracy, families of convicted &quot;enemies of the people,&quot; etc.) were forced to relocate to Kazakhstan, many of whom settled in Dzhambul. Some were evacuated to Kazakhstan, and to Dzhambul, during WWII from the areas that were, or were feared to come, under German occupation. The city&#x27;s population continued to grow throughout the 1960s and 1970s in spite of the end of exiles, due to an industrial spurt the city received during that time. As a result, Dzhambul had a highly diverse population composed of multiple ethnic groups, the largest being the Russians, followed by the Kazakhs. Fast-paced industrialization brought many amenities of modern urban living to the city, previously largely unknown, such as typical Soviet apartment blocks as well as condo-style houses, now all supplied with electricity and running water; roads and public transport; several higher education institutions; large public parks, department stores, etc.

Although chemical and construction industries made up the core of the city&#x27;s economy, Dzhambul continued to function as an unofficial trade post with its proximity to the other Central Asian republics and a relatively mobile population. The city was known in the area for its large bazaars with farmers selling agricultural produce from throughout the region.

=== After independence ===
Dzhambul, along with much of Kazakhstan, suffered a severe economic crisis in the early 1990s after the break-up of the Soviet Union, with many industries coming to an almost complete halt. The demographics of the city have changed drastically as well. The city lost a significant portion of its population with the exodus of the various nationalities that once made up its diversity, notably the Volga Germans and the Jews, as well as many Russians and Ukrainians. This trend was partially off-set by the migration of Kazakhs from rural areas into the city. The city&#x27;s name was changed to its Kazakh spelling (Zhambyl) in the early 1992 and to Taraz (Тараз) in 1997. The city&#x27;s economy has experienced a partial revival in the early 2000s. The city established a sister city relationship with Fresno, California, United States according to Sister Cities International, but this relationship is inactive. In 2001, Taraz also entered into a sister city relationship with Muncie, Indiana.

On November 12, 2011, a gunman &quot;described by officials as a jihadist&quot; killed at least eight people, including five police officers and himself, in Taraz.

The eponymous domestic vodka, Taraz, considered the best in Kazakhstan, is produced in the city.

<text>Fitchburg State University (Fitchburg State) is a public university in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. It has 3,421 undergraduate and 1,238 graduate/continuing education students, for a total student body enrollment of 4,659. The university offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in 25 academic disciplines. The main campus, the McKay Campus School, and athletic fields occupy in the city of Fitchburg; the biological study fields occupy in the neighboring towns of Lancaster, Leominster, and Lunenburg.

==History==
 Fitchburg State University was founded as the State Normal School in Fitchburg in 1894 by the Massachusetts General Court. Its first President was John G. Thompson (President 1895–1920). Initially a secondary-education school for women, the Normal School was not authorized to grant bachelor&#x27;s degrees until 1930, after the presidency of William D. Parkinson (1920–1927), and during Charles M. Herlihy&#x27;s (1927–1945) tenure. In 1932, that authorization was extended to all academic disciplines in Education. At the same time, the name was changed to State Teachers College at Fitchburg. Charles M. Herlihy died while in office and was succeeded by William J. Sanders (1945–1950) and Ellis F. White (1950–1953).

During Ralph H. Weston&#x27;s (1953–1963) presidency of the college, the Education program was the primary focus. That changed in 1960, when the school changed its name to State College at Fitchburg and added degree programs outside of Education. In 1965, the college&#x27;s name evolved into Fitchburg State College. James J. Hammond (1963–1975), Vincent J. Mara (1975–1995), and Michael P. Riccards (1995-2002) were the next three presidents of the school and added many buildings to the campus, most notably what are now called the Hammond Building and Mara Village.

Under the guidance of President Robert V. Antonucci (2003–2015), the university focused on enhancing its buildings and grounds in addition to growing its academic programs. The school focused on renovations and rehabilitation of underused buildings and areas as opposed to extensive building. Notable buildings include the campus police station (2008) and the Antonucci Science Complex, which included new construction combined with the renovation of the Condike Science Building, in 2011.

Continuing Education at the institution began in the summer of 1915. In 1935 the first graduate programs were established. In July 2010, the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate voted to rename Fitchburg State College to Fitchburg State University. The measure was signed into law by Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick on July 28, 2010.

==Campus==
The university originally housed students in buildings that now surround the alumni quad.

===Campus buildings===

Gallucci-Cirio Library, the Information Desk, the Game Room, the Falcon Hub (formerly The Underground Pub), the Follet Bookstore, the Campus Center Cafe, and the North Street Bistro (which includes BYOB, 2Mato, Subway, and Freshens).

These special collections include works from Robert Cormier, well-known author for young adults, and R. A. Salvatore, a prolific fantasy writer, well known for his &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; novels and &quot;The DemonWars Saga&quot;. There are works by Richard Kent, former music teacher for whom Kent Recital Hall was named, Ernst Fandreyer&#x27;s translation of Gauss&#x27; proof, works by William Wolkovich-Valkavicius, as well as papers by John Ellis Van Courtland Moon, former professor of history.
* Thompson Hall, built in 1896, was the university&#x27;s original building. It is now primarily a classroom building. It is home to the Nursing Department and its laboratories, including a 10-bed mock hospital which is fully equipped to be used in case of an emergency on campus. When the Hammond Campus Center was built, a tunnel that ran to the former Palmer House dormitory was made into a thoroughfare between the second level of the new building and the basement of Thompson Hall.

* Edgerly Hall was first used as &quot;an eighth-grade model and practice school,&quot; which made it one of the first junior high schools in America. It is now home to the Computer Science and Mathematics departments, plus computer labs and classrooms.
* Percival Hall is directly across the Quad from Edgerly and is the home of the Behavioral Science department, including psychology, sociology, and criminal justice It also houses Percival Auditorium, which seats 400, and classrooms.
* Miller Hall sits near Percival Hall and Thompson Hall, and houses offices for the English and History departments.
* The Anthony Student Service Center is the student service center on campus, hosting offices for Admissions, Financial Aid, Student Accounts, Graduate and Continuing Education, Registrar, and the OneCard office.
* The Dupont Facilities Building houses the schools maintenance department.
* The Antonucci Science Complex houses science classrooms, laboratories and departmental offices, as well as a 90-seat lecture hall. In 2013, construction of a new &quot;state of the art&quot; 54,700 square foot Science Center Lab Wing was completed, which houses teaching and research laboratory space. In 2014, a full renovation of the pre-existing Condike Science Building was completed. The Antonucci Science Complex currently houses the Department of Geo/Physical Sciences and the Department of Biology and Chemistry.
* The Conlon Arts Building is actually two buildings connected by an enclosed walkway. One building is home to the large communications/media and industrial technology departments and home to the school&#x27;s Information Technology office. This section of the building includes large video and film production resources, a large photography and graphic arts department, and metal, wood, and theatrical scene shops. The other part contains a 280-seat lecture hall, the offices of the fine arts faculty, as well as art/music studios and classrooms.
===Residence halls===
The campus has six residence halls, three of which have rooms in suites, two are designated as apartment-style living, and one has a normal dormitory layout.
Aubuchon Hall, Mara Village, and Russell Towers are the three suite halls. Each suite has a common living room area, four to six rooms, and a bathroom. Aubuchon Hall and Mara Village have &quot;locked off&quot; suites: A key is needed to get into the suites. Aubuchon is home to the office of Housing and Residential Services, which is located on the first floor. Russell is home to the Student Health Service, which provides students with two nurse practitioners and a physician during the week. Recently, the Campus Mail Center moved to the bottom floor of the Mara Village Commons Building located within the Mara complex.

There are two apartment-style residence halls on campus: the Townhouse Apartments and the North Street Apartments. Because of their layout, both of these halls are usually reserved for upperclassmen. Each one of the 33 Townhouses is equipped with a combination living room/kitchen area, one-and-a-half baths, and individual bedrooms. The North Street Apartment building was acquired in the summer of 2007 and consists of six apartments. Each apartment has five single bedrooms, a full bathroom and a half bathroom, a kitchen and a living room area.

Herlihy Hall is the smallest and oldest of the university&#x27;s current residence halls but has the largest rooms. It houses 150 students in a normal dormitory style (one long corridor with rooms off it), and has the luxury of being connected to the dining commons.
Mara Village was recently expanded and opened for the fall 2009 semester. The $12 million expansion added 125 beds and allows 50% of the undergraduate population to live on campus.

The campus has also adopted Cedar Street Home as a residence hall. Previously, this building from 1900 was a nursing home. The university bought it in 2005 and to rent the single rooms to girls from sororities. However, in the 2012–2013 academic year the Cedar Street Home became co-ed, and no longer affiliated with sororities specifically.

Holmes Dining Commons, known as the Dining Hall, is the main dining facility on campus. It spans North Street, the main road through campus, and lets foot traffic easily move from one side of the street to the other. It is run by the foodservice Chartwells and is buffet style. In the summer of 2006, it had a $4 million renovation.

Chartwells also offers a food court style eating place in the North Street Bistro, located on the street level of the Hammond Campus Center. Food options at the NSB include BYOB, Create, Cafe, Freshens and Subway. Students are able to pay with their &#x27;Fitchburg Gold&#x27; (currency loaded onto their student IDs that functions like a debit card) or with the &#x27;Falcon Dollars&#x27; which are included within their meal plan.

<text>Oakland Arena, often referred to as the Oakland Coliseum Arena, is an indoor arena in Oakland, California, and part of the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Complex. Opened in 1966, the arena was originally home to the California Seals of the Western Hockey League (WHL), later of the National Hockey League (NHL), until their move to Cleveland in 1976. The arena most famously served as home to the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1971 to 2019, excluding a period of extensive renovation during the 1996-97 NBA season.

==History==

===Home franchises===
The arena was the home of the Golden State Warriors from 1971 to 2019; for the 1996–97 season, however, the team played at San Jose Arena while Oakland Arena underwent extensive renovations. The California Golden Bears of the Pac-10 played the 1997–98 and 1998–99 seasons at the arena while their primary home, Harmon Gym, was being renovated into Haas Pavilion. For some years before then, the Bears played occasional games against popular non-conference opponents at the arena.

Oracle Arena has hosted games of the NBA Finals in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, where the Warriors won the NBA championship in 2015, 2017, and 2018. That 2015 title was the first time since 1975 the Warriors won the title; however, Games 2 and 3 of the 1975 NBA Finals were played at the Cow Palace in Daly City, as the Coliseum was unavailable at the time. The 2017 championship was the first time that a San Francisco-area team won a title in their home venue since the Oakland Athletics in the 1974 World Series.

The arena&#x27;s first tenants were the California Seals of the Western Hockey League, who moved across the bay from the Cow Palace in 1966. The owners of the San Francisco Seals had been awarded an expansion franchise in the National Hockey League, on the condition they move out of the Cow Palace and into the then-new Oakland Coliseum Arena. The team changed its operating name from San Francisco Seals to California Seals in order to draw fans from both San Francisco and Oakland. The California Golden Seals continued to play at the arena after having transferred to the NHL, until the team moved to Cleveland after the 1975–76 NHL season.

The Coliseum hosted the American Basketball Association&#x27;s Oakland Oaks (1967–1969), a charter member of the new ABA in 1967. The Oaks signed San Francisco Warriors star Rick Barry away from the rival National Basketball Association in 1968. The team was owned by entertainer Pat Boone and also had stars Larry Brown and Doug Moe on its roster. Brown and Barry are in the Basketball Hall of Fame. After a 22–56 record in their first season, the Oaks went 60–18 during the regular season in 1968–69. The Oaks then defeated the Denver Rockets, New Orleans Buccaneers and finally the Indiana Pacers in the playoffs to capture the ABA Championship. However, the team was plagued by poor attendance and Boone sold the team following their ABA Championship. They were relocated to Washington and became the Washington Caps.

The Bay Bombers (roller derby, 1966–1973) as well as the Golden Bay Earthquakes of the original MISL during the 1982–83 season and the Oakland Skates, a professional roller hockey team active from 1993 to 1995, all played there. WWE also holds professional wrestling shows at the arena.

In 2020, the Oakland Panthers of the Indoor Football League, co-owned by NFL All-Pro and Oakland native Marshawn Lynch, were to begin play at Oakland Arena. Due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Panthers postponed its start to 2022 and by August 2021, the Panthers announced they would instead play in San Jose as the Bay Area Panthers beginning with the 2022 season citing the uncertainty of the arena&#x27;s future.

===Renovation===
Over three decades, the arena grew outdated, lacking the luxuries of newer ones. With just over 15,000 seats, it was one of the smallest venues in the league. Rather than building a new arena in Oakland, San Francisco or San Jose, the decision was made to proceed with a US$121 million renovation that involved tearing out much of interior and building a new seating bowl within the existing structure. The original walls, roof and foundation remained intact, similar to the more recent rebuild of Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle. The renovation began in mid-1996 and was completed in time for the Warriors&#x27; return in the fall of 1997 (they played the 1996–97 season at the San Jose Arena, now the SAP Center at San Jose, home of the NHL&#x27;s Sharks). Included in the renovation was a new center overhead LED scoreboard and 360-degree fascia display. The new configuration seats 19,596 for basketball.

===Oracle naming rights deal===

On October 20, 2006, the Golden State Warriors and Oracle Corporation announced that Oakland Arena would be known as Oracle Arena for a 10-year term. A press conference was held on October 30. &quot;The O&quot;, as it is referred to, continued to be managed by Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Authority (JPA) and SMG. The JPA approved the deal at its November 10 meeting.

After the Warriors&#x27; resurgence since the 2012–13 season until the 2018–19 season, Oracle Arena was reckoned as one of the loudest arenas in the NBA. It was often called &quot;Roaracle&quot; because of the painfully high decibel levels sometimes generated at Warriors games. Shortly after the Warriors moved to San Francisco in 2019, the arena reverted to its old Oakland Arena name.

===Attendance records===
On May 13, 2007, 20,679 fans watched the Warriors lose to the Utah Jazz 115–101 in Game 4 of the Western Conference semifinals. This was the highest attendance in the Warriors&#x27; 61-year history.

That record lasted until December 14, 2007, when the Warriors hosted the Los Angeles Lakers and packed 20,705 into the Arena to set a new franchise attendance record.

The record was again broken on February 20, 2008, when the arena hosted 20,711 for the Warriors-Celtics game.

This record was broken yet again on April 10, 2008, when Oracle Arena hosted 20,737 fans in a Warriors loss to the Denver Nuggets.

By the end of the 2016–17 regular season, Oracle had sold out 230 consecutive home games, a streak that continued throughout the team&#x27;s playoff run. Oracle drew over 18,000 people per game for 12 straight seasons.

===Warriors move back to San Francisco===

Early in 2013, the Warriors announced they would move back to San Francisco and build a new arena. It was originally suggested that the arena would be built on the decaying sites of Piers 30–32 near the foot of the Bay Bridge, but the plan was met with opposition due to concerns about traffic, environmental impacts and obstruction of views. In April 2014, the Warriors purchased 12 acres in Mission Bay as the site for a new 18,000-seat arena planned to open for the 2018–19 NBA season. The new location eliminated the need for voter approval, which would have been required for the original site, though it had been unanimously approved by the San Francisco Supervisors in November 2012. Because of delays due to litigation filed by arena opponents the opening season was pushed to the start of the 2019–20 NBA season.

The new arena was named Chase Center. On January 9, 2019, the San Francisco Giants announced that their home AT&amp;T Park would be renamed Oracle Park, with the Oracle naming rights moving there from the arena. The Golden State Warriors played their final regular season game at Oracle Arena on April 7, 2019, with a 131–104 win over the Los Angeles Clippers. Notably, the team decided to wear their 2006–07 &quot;We Believe&quot; uniforms for that game, with the uniform choice not being revealed at any point beforehand until the Warriors players took off their warm-up uniforms shortly before tip-off, much to the delight of the home crowd. The Warriors played their final playoff game at Oracle Arena on June 13, 2019, a 114–110 loss to the Toronto Raptors in Game 6 of the NBA Finals. The loss ended the Warriors&#x27; quest for a third consecutive NBA championship. The court from that Finals game now sits at the Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre in Victoria, British Columbia.

Ever since the Warriors moved across the Bay to San Francisco, the arena remains open under the new name Oakland Arena.

<doc id="753594" wikidata="Q1387983" url="?curid=753594" title="First Battle of Memphis">
<text>The First Battle of Memphis was a naval battle fought on the Mississippi River immediately north of the city of Memphis, Tennessee on June 6, 1862, during the American Civil War. The engagement was witnessed by many of the citizens of Memphis. It resulted in a crushing defeat for the Confederate forces, and marked the virtual eradication of a Confederate naval presence on the river. Despite the lopsided outcome, the Union Army failed to grasp its strategic significance. Its primary historical importance is that it was the last time civilians with no prior military experience were permitted to command ships in combat. As such, it is a milestone in the development of professionalism in the United States Navy.

==Background==
The defending Confederates closely matched the advancing federal force in raw numbers, with eight rebel vessels opposing nine Union gunboats and rams, but the fighting qualities of the former were far inferior. Each was armed with only one or two guns, of a light caliber that would be ineffective against the armor of the gunboats. The primary weapon of each was its reinforced prow, which was intended to be used in ramming opponents.

The Confederate rams were distinguished by a unique feature of their defense against enemy shot. Their engines and other interior spaces were protected by a double bulkhead of heavy timbers, covered on the outer surface by a layer of railroad iron. The gap between the bulkheads, a space of , was packed with cotton. Although the cotton was the least important part of the armor, it caught the public&#x27;s attention, and the boats came to be called &quot;cottonclads&quot;. Later in the war, ships&#x27; crews were often protected from small-arms fire by bales of cotton placed in exposed positions, and these vessels were also referred to as &quot;cottonclads&quot;. They differed, however, from the originals of the category.

The federal force consisted of five gunboats, four of which were known semi-officially as &quot;Eads gunboats&quot;, after their builder, James Buchanan Eads, but more commonly as &quot;Pook turtles&quot;, after their designer, Samuel M. Pook, and their strange appearance. The fifth gunboat, flagship , was also a product of the Eads shipyards, but was converted from a civilian craft. Each of these vessels carried from 13–16 guns. The other four vessels were naval rams from the United States Ram Fleet. They had no armament whatever, aside from the small arms carried by the officers. All of the rams had been converted from civilian riverboats and had no common design.

==Organization==
Both sides entered the battle with faulty command structures. The federal gunboats were members of the Mississippi River Squadron, commanded directly by Flag Officer Charles H. Davis, who reported to Major General Henry W. Halleck. The gunboats were thus a part of the United States Army, although their officers were supplied by the navy. The rams were led by Colonel Charles Ellet, Jr., who reported directly to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. Thus the federal &quot;fleet&quot; consisted of two independent organizations, with no common command outside of Washington.

The Confederate arrangement was even worse. The cottonclads were about half of a group of fourteen river steamers that had been seized at New Orleans and converted into rams to defend that city. Known as the &quot;River Defense Fleet&quot;, it was split in two when the Confederate holdings on the river became threatened from both the north and the Gulf of Mexico. Six were retained below New Orleans to face the fleet of David G. Farragut, while eight were sent up to Memphis to block the Union descent down the river. Sending them this far north did not violate their original purpose, as Memphis was regarded as a shield for New Orleans. The northern (Memphis) section was commanded overall by James E. Montgomery, a riverboat captain in civilian life. The other boats were also commanded by former civilian riverboat captains, selected by Montgomery, and with no military training. Once under way, Montgomery&#x27;s command ceased, and the rams operated independently. The futility of this arrangement was recognized immediately by military men, but their protests were disregarded. Furthermore, the captains would neither learn how to handle the guns themselves, nor assign crew members to the task, so gun crews had to be drawn from the Confederate Army. The gunners were not integrated into the crews, but remained subject to the orders of their army officers.

==Cottonclad River Defense Fleet==
==Battle==
As a result of the federal victory at Corinth, the railroads that linked Memphis with the eastern part of the Confederacy had been cut, severely reducing the strategic importance of the city. Therefore, in early June 1862, Memphis and its nearby forts were abandoned by the rebel army. Most of the garrison were sent to join units elsewhere, including Vicksburg and only a small rear guard was left to make a token resistance. The River Defense Fleet was also to have retreated to Vicksburg, but it could not get enough coal in Memphis. Unable to flee when the federal fleet appeared on June 6, Montgomery and his captains had to decide whether to fight, or scuttle their boats. They chose to fight, steaming out in the early morning to meet the advancing flotilla and the rams trailing behind it, with Memphis citizens cheering them on.

The battle started with an exchange of gunfire at long range, the federal gunboats setting up a line of battle across the river and firing their rear guns at the cottonclads coming up to meet them as they entered the battle stern first. Two of the four rams advanced beyond the line of the gunboats and rammed or otherwise disrupted the movements of their opponents; the other rams misinterpreted their orders and did not enter the battle at all. With the federal rams and gunboats not coordinating their movements and the Confederate vessels operating independently, the battle soon was reduced to a melee. It is agreed by all that the ram flagship, , initiated hostilities by slamming into CSS &quot;Colonel Lovell&quot;. She was then rammed in turn by one or more of the remaining cottonclads. Ellet was at this time wounded by a pistol shot in his knee, thereby becoming the only casualty on the Union side. (In the hospital, he contracted measles, the childhood disease that killed some 5,000 soldiers during the war. The combination of the disease and the debilitation caused by his wound was too great, and he died on June 21.) The remainder of the battle is obscured by more than the fog of war. Several eyewitness accounts are available; however, they are mutually contradictory to a greater degree than usual. All that is certain is that at the end of the battle, all but one of the cottonclads were either destroyed or captured, and one Yankee boat, &quot;Queen of the West&quot;, was disabled. The sole boat to escape, CSS &quot;General Earl Van Dorn&quot;, fled to the protection of the Yazoo River, just north of Vicksburg.

==Results==
The battle, which took less than two hours in the early morning hours of June 6, resulted in the immediate surrender of the city of Memphis to federal authority by noon that day.

The Confederate casualties totaled approximately 100 killed or wounded and another 150 taken prisoner. The Union forces captured and repaired CSS &quot;General Price&quot;, CSS &quot;General Bragg&quot;, CSS &quot;Sumter&quot;, and CSS &quot;Little Rebel&quot;, and added them to the Mississippi River Squadron.

The battle of Memphis was, aside from the later appearance of the ironclad CSS &quot;Arkansas&quot;, the final challenge to the federal thrust down the Mississippi River against Vicksburg. The river was now open down to that city, which was already besieged by Farragut&#x27;s ships, but the federal army authorities did not grasp the strategic importance of the fact for nearly another six months. Not until November 1862 would the Union Army under Ulysses S. Grant attempt to complete the opening of the river.

The poor performance of the River Defense Fleet, both at Memphis and at the earlier Battle of New Orleans, was the final demonstration that naval operations had to be commanded by trained professionals subject to military discipline. The Ellet Rams remained in federal service, but they had no other opportunity for combat of the sort for which they were intended. They were soon transformed into an amphibious raiding body, the Mississippi Marine Brigade (with no connection to the United States Marine Corps), led by Ellet&#x27;s brother, Lieutenant Colonel (later Brigadier General) Alfred W. Ellet. The demand for increased professionalism also resulted in the elimination of privateering, although the River Defense Fleet was not composed of privateers in the usual meaning of the term.

The battle remains a cautionary tale, demonstrating the ill effects of a poor command structure. It is also one of only two purely naval battles of the war, excluding single-ship actions, and took place from the nearest open water. The other was the Battle of Plum Point Bend, also on the Mississippi.

Another civil war military engagement took place in Memphis, namely the Second Battle of Memphis in April 1864, when Confederate general, Nathan Bedford Forrest led a nighttime cavalry raid on Memphis with the intent of freeing Confederate prisoners and capturing Union generals encamped there. The raid failed in both goals, but forced the Union Army to guard the area more diligently.

<doc id="753598" wikidata="Q298573" url="?curid=753598" title="Frost Bank Center">
<text>Frost Bank Center (formerly AT&amp;T Center and SBC Center) is a multi-purpose indoor arena on the east side of San Antonio, Texas, United States. It is the home of the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association (NBA).

The arena seats 18,418 for basketball, and 19,000 for concerts or gatherings, and contains 2,018 club seats, 50 luxury suites and 32 bathrooms. It was opened in 2002 as the SBC Center, at a cost of US$175 million, financed by county-issued bonds, which were supported by a hotel-occupancy and car-rental tax increase and an additional contribution of $28.5 million from the Spurs. SBC Communications, Inc. purchased the naming rights to the facility under a 20-year, $41 million naming rights agreement with Bexar County, the San Antonio Spurs, and the San Antonio Stock Show &amp; Rodeo in July 2000. SBC Communications changed its name to AT&amp;T Inc. in November 2005. The arena officially changed its name to AT&amp;T Center in January 2006. On July 2, 2021, it was announced that AT&amp;T would not be renewing its contract for naming rights to the venue. On August 3, 2023, it was announced that Frost Bank would be the arena sponsor. The name change to Frost Bank Center became official on September 22, 2023, with the arena&#x27;s website and social media accounts reflecting the change immediately and the building signage updated soon after.

From 2003 to 2017, the arena was home to the San Antonio Stars of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association. It was the home of the San Antonio Rampage of the American Hockey League for 18 years (2002-2020).

== Alamodome ==

Previously, the Spurs played at the Alamodome, a multi-purpose facility with a configuration that allowed half the floor space to be used for basketball. Although the Alamodome was still relatively new (opening in 1993), it had become clear over the years that the Spurs were using it for most of the year, making it difficult to schedule contiguous dates for conventions or even a regular-season football schedule. The Alamodome&#x27;s seating capacity could be expanded to 35,000 for popular regular-season opponents, and attracted nearly 40,000 for a 1999 NBA Finals game. Although it had been designed with the Spurs in mind, the Spurs and their fans grew increasingly dissatisfied with the facility because of its poor sight lines and cavernous feel. The Alamodome&#x27;s basketball configuration had the basketball court at one end of where the football field would have been, leaving almost half of the stadium curtained off. Being primarily a football stadium differentiated the Alamodome from most other NBA facilities, including the Spurs&#x27; previous home, HemisFair Arena.

Additionally, since the Alamodome opened, there had been an uptick of new arena construction including facilities such as Conseco Fieldhouse (now Gainbridge Fieldhouse), which, in addition to offering an intimate atmosphere, offered teams several new revenue generating opportunities, including suites located on the lower levels and large club level seating areas.

==New facility==

The Spurs campaigned for several years for a new facility. The Spurs and the city had come to an agreement to build a new facility adjacent to the Alamodome, but in a last-minute reversal, the team partnered with Bexar County to construct a new arena adjacent to the Freeman Coliseum. As a part of the agreement, the facility would be home to the Spurs, a new ice hockey team (what became the Rampage), and the San Antonio Stock Show &amp; Rodeo event.

The facility would be funded through an increase of hotel and car rental taxes, and Bexar County voters approved the plan in November 1999. Coincidentally, the election was held on the same day the Spurs received their rings for their first NBA championship.

Rick Pych is the Chief Development Officer of the AT&amp;T Center and led the Spurs franchise through its development, construction and opening in 2002.

Unlike most arenas that can accommodate basketball and ice hockey, AT&amp;T Center was primarily designed for basketball. Nevertheless, it can accommodate an NHL-sized ice hockey rink, but it can only accommodate a maximum of 16,151 people for ice hockey since the seating arrangement for ice hockey is asymmetrical. There are only a few permanent rows of seating on the lower level of the west end, and all of the upper-level sets on the west end of the arena have obstructed views. This would result in poor sightlines. However, the seating capacity for Rampage games is under 7,000 people, making the upper level not necessary for those events.

In 2012, the Rampage renamed the press box to the &quot;Jessica Redfield Press Box&quot; after Jessica Redfield, an aspiring news broadcaster and a former team intern who was killed in the Aurora theater shooting.

==Construction==
After the arena referendum passed, planning quickly began for construction on the new facility. Naming rights were obtained in July 2000 when an agreement was reached with San Antonio-based SBC Communications to name the new arena the SBC Center. The agreement was reported to be for a total of $41 million over 20 years.
Ground was officially broken on the facility in August 2000. The arena&#x27;s basic design was similar to many of the other newer arenas in the NBA, thanks to the choice of Minneapolis-based Ellerbe Becket as the primary architects. A nationally recognized, local architecture firm, Lake/Flato, was teamed with Ellerbe Becket to work on the design of the structure. Lake/Flato is responsible for introducing a South Texas vernacular to the overall look of the arena. Ellerbe Becket was responsible for designing the Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis and Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C.

==Renovations==
On December 9, 2014, the Bexar County Commissioners Court gave Spurs Sports and Entertainment permission to begin up to $101.5 million in renovations to the AT&amp;T Center.

The renovations started in the summer of 2015, when the San Antonio Spurs finished the 2015 season. They included a new scoreboard, updated televisions inside and outside of the arena, a new state-of-the-art sound system, and improved Wi-Fi that covers about 90% of the venue. Expansions to the fan shop and other major parts of the AT&amp;T Center were also in the plans. The renovations were funded by a 2008 tax increase for improvements to the Tobin Center, parts of the Mission Reach expansion, and the rodeo grounds located next to the AT&amp;T Center.

==Notable events==
In addition to many local community and sporting events, the center hosts San Antonio Sports Car Association autocross competitions in the parking lot each month.

The Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association holds the San Antonio Stock Show &amp; Rodeo and an Xtreme Bulls tour event annually there. The Rodeo is held in February, necessitating the Spurs and Rampage to make long road trips during this time (commonly referred to as the &quot;Rodeo Road Trip&quot;).

On the weekend of August 1–2, 2009, the Professional Bull Riders hosted a Built Ford Tough Series event there (an event previously held at the Alamodome in 2007 and 2008). Since May 2013, the venue has also hosted the annual Bud Light River City Rockfest.

On October 1, 2016, the arena hosted the Kellogg&#x27;s Tour of Gymnastics Champions.

The arena has also hosted many WWE events including numerous episodes of &quot;WWE Raw&quot; and &quot;WWE SmackDown&quot; and the following pay-per views: Royal Rumble (2007), , Vengeance (2011), Hell in a Cell (2018), and the arena hosted Saturday Night’s Main Event on January 25, 2025. An episode of AEW Collision was held on December 23, 2023.

On June 28, 2014, &quot;UFC Fight Night: Swanson vs. Stephens&quot; was held at the arena. On July 20, 2019, &quot;UFC on ESPN: dos Anjos vs. Edwards&quot; was held at the arena. The event broke the record for most decisions in a row on one fight card. On March 25, 2023, &quot;UFC on ESPN: Vera vs. Sandhagen&quot; was held at the arena.

Black Sabbath played their final show in the United States here on November 12, 2016.

On April 10, 2019, Dirk Nowitzki of the Dallas Mavericks played his final NBA game at the arena in a 94–105 loss to the Spurs. A tribute video on behalf of the Spurs was shown and Nowitzki was moved to tears as the sold-out crowd congratulated him.

On July 27 &amp; 28, 2019, the arena hosted its first Hot Wheels Monster Trucks Live event.

<text>Dąbie (, &quot;Altdamm&quot;, or &quot;Stettin-Altdamm&quot;) is a former town and current municipal neighbourhood of the city of Szczecin in Poland, situated on the Płonia river, on the south coast of Dąbie Lake, on the right bank of Oder river, east of the Szczecin Old Town and Middle Town. As of January 2011 it had a population of 13,275.

==Dąbie name==

The name of Dąbie is of Slavonic origin and comes from the words like &quot;dąb&quot; (English: Oak), &quot;dąbie&quot;, &quot;dębina&quot; (English: Oak Forest).
The early Latin documents show the name as: 1121 Vadam, 1174 Dam, 1157 Dambe, 1179 Damba, 1242 Dambe, 14th century Damnis, and in German documents as: Damn, later Alt Damn (old Dąbie). Before 1945 when Stettin was a part of Germany, the German name of this suburb was &quot;Stettin-Altdamm&quot;. In 1945 the Polish name was temporarily: Dąb, Dąb Stary and later fixed to Dąbie, based on the earliest documents.

==History==
In the early 10th century a settlement of the Pomeranians, destroyed in 1121 in the war between Bolesław III of Poland with the Pomeranians. The village was rebuilt and in 1176 it was awarded by duke Warcislaw II to the Cistercian monastery in Kołbacz. In the following years Dąbie became the bridgehead for Szczecin and main trading post for the rich Cistercian land properties.

In 1249 duke Barnim I established a ducal municipality next to the village, and granted it autonomy under Magdeburg rights in 1260, changed to Lübeck rights in 1293.

During World War II a POW camp was erected there. On 20 March 1945, Altdamm was captured by troops of the 1st Belorussian Front of the Red Army in the course of the East Pomeranian offensive. It became part of Poland in 1945 as a result of the Potsdam Agreement. Dąbie was eventually incorporated into Szczecin on 29 April 1948.

<doc id="753605" wikidata="Q108582136" url="?curid=753605" title="The Rotunda (Longwood University)">
<text>The Rotunda is the name given to a building on the campus of Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. It was formerly known as Ruffner Hall, but the name was changed in 2019. The original Rotunda was built in 1839 and gradually expanded along with the school over several decades, to eventually include its iconic rotunda dome, until its completion in 1907. The building was eventually destroyed in a fire on April 24, 2001. The then-Longwood College began to rebuild the structure, and it was reopened just before the fourth anniversary of the fire, on April 23, 2005. The new Rotunda, in contrast to the old, has a basement to increase instructional space. 

==History==
Historically, the Rotunda &quot;was&quot; the college campus, prior to the school expanding west and south in the mid-twentieth century, including serving as both residence hall and classrooms. In the closing days of the American Civil War, High Street and the then-Farmville Female College saw both Confederate forces escaping the Battle of Sailor&#x27;s Creek towards Appomattox Court House, and the Union Army following them.

At the time of what became known as the &quot;Great Fire of 2001,&quot; Ruffner Hall was undergoing an extensive renovation, and there were no people or historically significant artifacts in the building. The fire also severely damaged surrounding buildings, leading to the demolition and reconstruction of next-door Grainger Hall, and renovations of four dormitories.

One noted architectural feature is a slate front step at the front door of the building, which had an indentation worn into it from thousands of students walking across it over decades. Following the fire, the damaged step was located, and a replica was installed in the reconstructed Rotunda.

==Art==
The centerpiece of the Rotunda is a reproduction of a sculpture of Joan of Arc by Henri Chapu, titled &quot;Joan of Arc Listening to the Voices&quot;, but popularly known as &quot;Joanie on the Stony.&quot; The Rotunda dome itself contains four lunettes as well as paintings of Thomas Jefferson, Horace Mann, William Henry Ruffner, and Jabez Lamar Monroe Curry.

<doc id="753611" wikidata="Q1309059" url="?curid=753611" title="Wynn Las Vegas">
<text>Wynn Las Vegas, often simply referred to as Wynn, is a luxury resort and casino located on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada, United States. It is owned and operated by Wynn Resorts, and was built on the former site of the Desert Inn resort, which opened in 1950. Casino developer Steve Wynn purchased and closed the Desert Inn during 2000, with plans to build a new resort on the site. The design phase lasted two and a half years, and construction began on October 31, 2002, with Marnell Corrao Associates as general contractor. At a cost of $2.7 billion, Wynn Las Vegas was the most expensive resort ever built, beating Wynn&#x27;s $1.6 billion Bellagio, which opened on the Strip in 1998.

Wynn Las Vegas opened on April 28, 2005, with 2,716 rooms and a casino. At the time, its 45-story hotel tower was the tallest building in Nevada. A sister property, Encore Las Vegas, was opened by Wynn Resorts in December 2008. Located directly north of the resort, Encore added a second hotel tower and additional gaming space, as well as several restaurants and clubs. In total, the Wynn complex contains 4,748 rooms and of gaming space. Wynn declared his $5.2 billion complex finished in May 2010, following additions made at Encore.

Unlike most Strip resorts, the Wynn does not feature a theme. In a break from Wynn&#x27;s previous resorts, it also lacks a free attraction for pedestrians. Instead, an artificial mountain obscures most of the attractions, meant to evoke curiosity and lure people into the resort. A lake is surrounded by the mountain and several restaurants, and is the site of a show called &quot;Lake of Dreams&quot;, which features singing animatronics.

The Desert Inn&#x27;s golf course was kept and redesigned to become the Wynn&#x27;s course. Upon opening, the resort also included the state&#x27;s only Ferrari and Maserati dealership, which later closed in 2015. The property has two retail areas, Wynn Esplanade and Wynn Plaza, the latter replacing the dealership in 2018. Tryst, a popular nightclub by Victor Drai, opened in 2005 and operated for 10 years.

Since its opening, Wynn Las Vegas has received numerous accolades, including the AAA Five Diamond Award and the Five Star award from Forbes Travel Guide. The accolades also extend to its restaurants, including Alex, a French eatery by chef Alex Stratta which eventually closed in 2011. Another restaurant, Wing Lei, is the only Chinese restaurant in the U.S. to receive a Michelin Star. Other popular restaurants include The Buffet at Wynn.

The resort&#x27;s main show was &quot;Le Rêve&quot;, which opened with the property in 2005. It had a successful run before closing in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The show took place in the Wynn Theater. A second venue, the Broadway Theater, was also built with the resort. It was later renamed the Encore Theater, after the sister resort property, and is now situated between the two resorts. The Encore Theater has hosted numerous shows, including &quot;Avenue Q&quot; and &quot;Spamalot&quot;, as well as entertainers such as Beyoncé, Danny Gans and Garth Brooks.

In 2006, table game dealers at the resort protested a new policy requiring them to share tips with their supervisors. The policy sparked years of litigation between Wynn and the dealers, with a $5.6 million settlement eventually reached in 2021.

==History==
Wynn Las Vegas was built on the former site of the Desert Inn, a casino resort which opened in 1950. Local developer Steve Wynn purchased the resort in 2000, as a birthday present for wife Elaine Wynn. Wynn had recently sold his company, Mirage Resorts, and used the money to buy the Desert Inn. The resort was closed later that year, with plans to build a new one in its place. Wynn partnered with businessman Kazuo Okada and his company Aruze, which would help finance the project. In August 2001, Wynn unveiled specific plans for the project, which would retain the Desert Inn&#x27;s golf course. The resort was expected to open sometime in 2004. Wynn expected it to compete against his former Bellagio resort, which he had recently sold along with Mirage Resorts.

===Name===
Wynn announced the resort&#x27;s initial name, &quot;Le Rêve&quot; (French for &quot;The Dream&quot;), in October 2001. It was named after a 1932 Picasso painting that Wynn had purchased. Wynn trademarked the &quot;Le Rêve&quot; name earlier in 2001, and later purchased the rights from the Le Rêve hotel in West Hollywood, California.
In June 2003, Wynn announced that he had renamed the resort after himself; market research showed that &quot;Wynn&quot; had better name recognition. According to Wynn: &quot;No one knows what Le Reve is. No one knows how to pronounce it&quot;. &quot;Wynn&quot; was once considered as a name for his previous resorts, The Mirage and Bellagio. By the time of the name change, he was already planning to build the Wynn Macau resort in China, and said, &quot;Others have finally convinced me that the Wynn name would allow us to cross-market and offer a consistency of branding for all our properties&quot;. Three individuals in particular helped convince him to change the name: businessmen Barry Diller and Donald Trump, and film director Steven Spielberg.

France was opposed to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and this was also a reason for changing the resort&#x27;s name. According to chief architect DeRuyter Butler: &quot;The name Le Reve is very closely tied to France, which was an opponent to our political approach to Iraq. It wasn&#x27;t anything derogatory toward France, but Mr. Wynn started to look at other potential names&quot;.

Wynn&#x27;s surname signature is used as the resort&#x27;s logo, and is present in illuminated lettering along the top of the hotel tower. The logo ends with a period punctuation mark. According to longtime local reporter Steve Friess, the resort &quot;screamed Wynn Period as if to say, &quot;&#x27;This&quot; is the Wynn. Period.&#x27; Wynn once told me as much, explaining it was a subtle way of saying that this is the definition of his embodiment as a resort, the ultimate&quot;. In a 2005 commercial, Wynn himself promoted the resort as &quot;the only one I&#x27;ve ever signed my name to&quot;.

===Financing and construction===
The Desert Inn&#x27;s Augusta Tower was imploded in October 2001, and construction on the new resort was scheduled to begin two months later. However, this was delayed by complications in excavating the former site of the Augusta Tower. The resort was expected to cost $1.6 billion, and the start of construction was further delayed by difficulty acquiring funds.

By June 2002, the project cost had increased to $1.8 billion. This would make it the most expensive casino resort in the world, topping Wynn&#x27;s $1.6 billion Bellagio. Wynn announced that the project would be partly financed by bank loans and Aruze, in addition to an initial public offering (IPO) in Wynn Resorts. Wynn had previously wanted to retain private ownership and dismissed the idea of selling stock to raise financing. Wynn Resorts hoped to raise $470 million through the IPO, selling one-third of its shares; the remainder would be held by Wynn himself and Aruze. Ahead of the IPO launch, Wynn traveled around the U.S. to pitch his plans, spending three weeks on the road. Investors were apprehensive about the project because of the lengthy construction schedule ahead. In response, Wynn Resorts reduced the share price to attract investors.

Marnell Corrao Associates, which built Wynn&#x27;s previous resorts, was hired as general contractor. Groundbreaking took place on October 31, 2002, with a ceremony attended by hundreds of people, including Nevada senators Harry Reid and John Ensign, and former governor Bob Miller. As of June 2003, construction proceeded on a 24-hour schedule, with rebar installation during the day and concrete pours at night. The tower was topped off in February 2004. As project costs increased, another stock offering in Wynn Resorts took place later that year to raise additional financing. Hiring began on November 1, 2004. Within three months, more than 80,000 people applied for jobs at the resort, which would employ 9,000. In total, the resort received 105,000 applications.

As of January 2005, construction crews were working on a 20-hour schedule each day to get the resort finished on time. At a final cost of $2.7 billion, it was the most expensive resort ever built. Analysts anticipated that Wynn Las Vegas would launch a new wave of resort construction on the Strip. The resort was also expected to help transform the northern Strip and attract an upper-class clientele to the area. Several new Strip projects were announced during Wynn&#x27;s construction, including The Palazzo, CityCenter, Fontainebleau, and Echelon Place.

===Opening and operation===
Wynn kept many details about the project secretive until its opening, granting few interviews prior to that point. He said the resort&#x27;s features were difficult to describe: &quot;That&#x27;s the reason there hasn&#x27;t been a lot of chatter about the hotel. It&#x27;s not because we&#x27;re trying to keep a secret. This is a place that does not lend itself to verbalization. So, when you start to describe them, you resort to strained attempts to communicate something no one has seen&quot;. As the opening approached, Wynn appeared in a commercial promoting the new resort, in which he is shown on the roof of the hotel tower. The advertisement aired during Super Bowl XXXIX in February 2005, and was subsequently broadcast in Phoenix, San Diego, and Los Angeles.

Wynn Las Vegas opened at 12:01 a.m. on April 28, 2005, Elaine&#x27;s birthday. It was the first new resort to open on the Strip since the Aladdin in 2000. The public opening was preceded by a private charity fundraiser reception for approximately 2,000 guests. An estimated 10,000 people attended the public opening. The resort marked Wynn&#x27;s return to the Nevada gaming industry, five years after selling Mirage Resorts.
Within the first year, changes were made to several resort amenities as part of a fine-tuning effort. A second hotel resort, Encore Las Vegas, was built as a sister property. It opened directly north of Wynn Las Vegas in December 2008, occupying the remainder of the Desert Inn site. Additions were made to Encore in May 2010, at which point Wynn declared the completion of the $5.2 billion Wynn complex. A $99 million renovation of the Wynn hotel was completed in 2011.

In 2013, Wynn tapped Sean Christie to attract film productions to the resort. Christie, who oversaw several nightclubs on the property, put together a team and spent six months promoting the resort for film purposes. Wynn Las Vegas made its feature debut in 2015, with the release of two films: &quot;Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2&quot; was shot throughout the resort, while &quot;The Squeeze&quot; filmed on the golf course. The resort made subsequent appearances in the films &quot;Frank &amp; Lola&quot; (2016) and &quot;The House&quot; (2017). By 2017, Wynn Las Vegas had become one of the world&#x27;s most photographed hotels among the general public.

In March 2020, the Wynn properties were among the first Las Vegas resorts to close as the COVID-19 pandemic reached Nevada. The Wynn complex, along with other local resorts, reopened three months later. In contrast to most other resorts, the Wynn properties reopened with all amenities allowed under state health guidelines. Air travel saw a reduction in the early months of the pandemic, and the Wynn resorts relied largely on drive-in tourists from Arizona and California. However, visitation soon declined after both states endured a surge in COVID-19 cases. Wynn Resorts reduced its work force, and Encore temporarily shifted to a four-day weekly operating schedule. As revenue improved in 2021, a $200 million renovation of the two hotel towers was announced.

During the following October, the 2022 Las Vegas Strip stabbing spree occurred in front of the resort.

In 2023, a tunnel was drilled to the resort for a future station of the Las Vegas Convention Center Loop, an underground car shuttle service.

===Union history and tip policy===
A few months after opening, the resort signed an unprecedented 10-year union agreement with the Culinary Workers Union. Previous agreements at other resorts had only gone up to five years. The Wynn contract covered 4,000 workers; the resort&#x27;s 600 table game dealers were among those not covered.

In August 2006, Wynn Las Vegas announced a tip-sharing policy requiring its dealers to share tips with their managers. Wynn dealers made up to $100,000 per year, making this among the most profitable positions in the gaming industry. The policy was meant to equalize incomes between dealers and supervisors; the latter earned significantly less income, resulting in a shortage of supervisory positions. Dealers said the policy could cost them $20,000 in annual income. In addition to tips, Wynn also gave supervisors a $5,000 raise. The tip-sharing policy was later implemented at Encore Las Vegas as well.

Two Wynn dealers filed a lawsuit against the resort challenging the policy, but were eventually dismissed by a judge. Two other dealers filed complaints with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), and also filed lawsuits against Wynn, alleging that he went on a tirade during a meeting with dealers. In 2007, the Nevada Legislature attempted and failed to pass a bill which would have ended the resort&#x27;s tip-sharing policy. Later that year, dealers voted to unionize through the Transport Workers Union of America (TWU), hoping to put an end to the policy. A couple of dealers were fired allegedly over their pro-union stance.

An agreement on a final union contract was slow-moving. Meanwhile, litigation regarding the tip-sharing policy continued for several years. In 2010, the state labor commissioner ruled it legal. Later that year, dealers voted to approve a 10-year union contract with TWU. Wynn officials were happy with the agreement, which was identical to one previously offered by the resort a year earlier. Tip-sharing continued under the union contract. The labor commissioner&#x27;s ruling was appealed by the dealers and later overturned by a judge, prompting further litigation. Federal lawsuits were filed by dealers in 2013 and again in 2018, seeking to recoup lost tip wages. A $5.6 million settlement was reached in 2021, benefiting approximately 1,000 current and former dealers. That year, the dealers voted to join the United Autoworkers Gaming Union in a three-year deal. It protected Wynn dealers from the tip-sharing policy, which remained in effect at Encore.

In a separate case, the resort&#x27;s nightclub employees were also required to share tips with management. The workers, already covered by the Culinary union, filed a class-action lawsuit against the resort in 2010, alleging that the policy was a violation of union contract. The suit was dismissed the following year by a judge, ruling that the issue should instead be handled through arbitration.

===Expansion proposal===

In early 2018, Wynn Resorts bought the site where the New Frontier Hotel and Casino stood before its demolition, as well as four adjacent acres, all located across the street from Wynn and Encore. The company planned to build a new casino resort, Wynn West, to complement the existing properties. It would include between 2,000 and 3,000 rooms. However, CEO Steve Wynn resigned from the company shortly after the land purchase, following sexual misconduct allegations against him. Matt Maddox took over as CEO, and plans for Wynn West were shelved.

In 2024, the county extended permits for the site, giving Wynn until April 2026 to commence construction on an unnamed resort expansion. The project, to be built on , would include a hotel tower with 1,100 rooms, as well as a casino and of convention space.

==Design==
Unlike most Strip resorts, Wynn Las Vegas does not have a theme. Wynn said: &quot;Our resort will become famous and people will copy us. We&#x27;re not trying to copy Rome or Italy or New York. It&#x27;s about the beauty of our desert. It&#x27;s time for Las Vegas to have its own hotel, its own architecture&quot;. He described the design process as &quot;exquisitely uncomfortable&quot; and &quot;the most exciting experience&quot; of his life. According to Wynn Resorts, the &quot;property, rather than a theme, will be the attraction, and, therefore, will have more lasting appeal to customers&quot;.
Although the resort covers more than , Wynn sought to make it feel small and intimate, unlike other resorts. His in-house architectural team was led by DeRuyter Butler. The interior design was largely handled by The Jerde Partnership and Wynn&#x27;s longtime designer Roger Thomas. In total, more than 130 designers worked on the project, including Jane Radoff, another longtime interior designer for Wynn.

The design team looked to the Bellagio for inspiration, seeking to replicate its success while correcting its mistakes. The design phase lasted two and a half years. Natural light is emphasized throughout the casino and restaurant areas, as well as an indoor garden atrium, similar to the Bellagio&#x27;s conservatory. The atrium features live trees and plants, as well as flowers that are changed regularly. Red, a lucky color among Asian gamblers, is also used throughout the resort, along with an abundance of flower designs.

The hotel tower has a curved floor plan, and a swooped crown. The hotel tower&#x27;s exterior consists of bronze reflective glass, and white lines every two floors which light up at night. The resort&#x27;s logo on swooped crown of the hotel tower lights up at night in yellow. Architects had a mixed opinion of Wynn Las Vegas&#x27; design. New York architect Ronnette Riley compared the hotel tower to &quot;a big UPS truck&quot; and was critical of its use of reflective glass, which she considered long outdated. Others found the design mature and sophisticated. According to David G. Schwartz, director of the Center for Gaming Research at UNLV, &quot;Wynn invested his very legacy in the new resort, and history will likely vindicate him. Substance over style will be the wave of the future&quot;.

Architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne negatively compared Wynn Las Vegas to a &quot;midrise office tower in Houston, circa 1983&quot;. Wynn said that critics &quot;missed the point&quot; of the hotel tower&#x27;s design: &quot;This is a stack of hotel rooms. [...] the reality is that I have to cater to guests. Under that, form follows function&quot;. Tom Gorman, also writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, found the interior of Wynn Las Vegas to be largely derivative of Bellagio, while calling the overall resort &quot;coy&quot; compared to Wynn&#x27;s previous properties. Fred A. Bernstein of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the design of the public spaces &quot;stylistically incoherent (a bit of Italy, a bit of France, more than a bit of Disneyland)&quot;, but also found that there &quot;are plenty of nice touches&quot;.

==Features==

The front of Wynn&#x27;s previous Strip resorts each included free attractions to lure pedestrians inside, such as an artificial volcano at the Mirage, pirate shows at Treasure Island, and the Fountains of Bellagio. In a departure, Wynn Las Vegas obscures its attractions to outside pedestrians by way of an artificial mountain, meant to evoke curiosity and lure people into the resort. It also serves to hide vehicle traffic from guests. The mountain idea was conceived by Steve and Elaine Wynn; the former had previously planned a mountain attraction at the Mirage before scrapping the idea.

The mountain at Wynn Las Vegas was designed by Don Brinkerhoff and designed by his landscape architectural company, Lifescapes International, which worked on Wynn&#x27;s previous resorts. The mountain rises more than . It is made up of terraced walls, with soil compacted into place. The mountain cost $130 million to build, and includes 1,500 trees, many of them relocated from the former Desert Inn golf course. The mountain also has several waterfalls, some up to in height. In front of the mountain, and obscured from outside pedestrians, is a lake overlooked by several restaurants. This area is home to the show &quot;Lake of Dreams&quot;.

The resort includes a roadside sign along the Strip. It was created by YESCO and measures in height. It includes an LED screen high and wide, with a platform that moves up and down across the screen as an &quot;eraser&quot;, presenting new images with each movement.

===Hotel and casino===

The hotel tower is 45 stories, although its top floor is labeled &quot;60&quot;. The tower skips multiple floors, including those containing the number 4, which Chinese gamblers view as unlucky. The tower has a height of . At the time of completion, it was the tallest building in Nevada.
The hotel opened with 2,716 rooms, including suites. The resort includes Tower Suites, a hotel-within-a-hotel. As of 2008, Wynn Las Vegas was the only hotel-casino in the world to have a five-star rating from Mobil Travel Guide, receiving the accolade for its Tower Suites. The property also offered villas on the golf course fairway for its high rollers, a target demographic. As of 2008, the resort had the largest vehicle fleet of Rolls-Royce Phantom limousines in North America. The 10 custom-made vehicles were used for high rollers and celebrity guests. In 2016, the hotel announced that it would place an Amazon Echo in every room, becoming the first resort in the world to do so. The Echo is used to control various aspects of the room, such as temperature and lighting.

The casino measures . Upon opening, it included 1,962 slot machines and 137 table games. In a break from past casinos, chandeliers were built over each gaming table. In addition, the casino had a poker room, keno lounge, a baccarat salon, and a sports book with a lounge for VIP players. For hotel guests, room keycards doubled as slot cards; Wynn was the first casino to do so. The casino was also among the first in Las Vegas, along with the Hard Rock Hotel to use RFID in its gaming chips to detect counterfeiting. In 2011, the resort became the first in Las Vegas to allow wagers on non-sporting events. The sports book underwent a major renovation in 2017, which included the addition of a video wall measuring by .

The Wynn complex, including Encore, covers . In total, the complex has 4,748 hotel rooms, and of gaming space.

===Golf course===
The Desert Inn golf course was retained, receiving a new layout and landscaping to become the Wynn Golf Club. It is the only course on the Strip. The 70-par, 18-hole course measures 6,722 yards, and covers .
In 2000, Wynn&#x27;s company, Valvino Lamore LLC, acquired 41 residential homes at Desert Inn Estates, part of the former resort&#x27;s country club. The company spent $270 million to buy the golf course and another $50 million for the houses. A dozen remaining homeowners declined to sell and filed suit against Wynn to prevent his redevelopment plans, and he sued them in response. In 2003, Wynn sought to remove state oversight of the property&#x27;s water by getting a Nevada Assembly bill passed. As owner of the Desert Inn Water Company, Wynn was required to have all his financial plans for the site undergo review by the state&#x27;s Public Utilities Commission (PUC). He sought to avoid this in the event that he should have to alter his financing plans for the resort. Homeowners objected, believing that Wynn&#x27;s proposal would give him unreasonable power over their water supply. A modified water bill was signed by Nevada governor Kenny Guinn later that year, eliminating certain financial reporting requirements while allowing the PUC to maintain jurisdiction over the residents. In 2004, Wynn reached an agreement to buy the remaining 10 homes for $23 million.

The Desert Inn course was redesigned by Wynn and Tom Fazio, who both previously worked together on the design for Shadow Creek Golf Course. The Wynn course includes 1,200 trees saved from the former Desert Inn course. The largest trees were left in place; smaller ones were temporarily relocated to a nursery while the course was redesigned. Aside from the trees, a bridge was the only other remnant from the Desert Inn course. New streams and lakes were added to the site, along with elevation changes. The par-70 course measured 7,042 yards.
By the end of 2004, Wynn had tentative plans to eventually redevelop the golf course as a mixed-use project revolving around a man-made lake. The project could include hotels, gaming space, and residences, similar to MGM&#x27;s CityCenter. In 2014, Wynn said he would never redevelop the golf course. He later changed his position and announced new plans for the site in 2016, in the form of Wynn Paradise Park. The project would cost up to $1.6 billion, and would include a hotel and small casino overlooking a lagoon, where guests could take part in various water activities. It would also include a white sand beach and boardwalk. Wynn found the site too valuable to leave undeveloped.

The golf course closed in December 2017, to make way for construction of Paradise Park. Several months later, Matt Maddox took over as CEO of Wynn Resorts, following Steve Wynn&#x27;s resignation. Commenting on Paradise Park, Maddox said, &quot;We weren&#x27;t really interested in building a large public swimming pool for the Las Vegas Strip&quot;. Plans for the project were scrapped at the end of 2018, after construction costs had risen to $3 billion. A convention facility was the only aspect of the project to proceed, being built on a portion of the golf course. Fazio and his son Logan were hired to revamp the remaining golf course acreage. The redesign included 10 revamped holes and 8 new ones.

The course reopened in October 2019, serving as an additional amenity for the casino&#x27;s heavily male demographic. The course had lost the Wynn property up to $15 million during its closure. At $550 per round of golf, it was one of the most expensive courses in the U.S. upon its reopening. In 2022, the golf course hosted the Las Vegas Concours d&#x27;Elegance automotive event.

The course was the host of the inaugural Netflix Cup in November 2023 prior to the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix.

===Restaurants===

Wynn Las Vegas opened with 18 restaurants, including a buffet and two steakhouses: SW, standing for &quot;Steve Wynn&quot;; and Country Club Grill, overlooking the golf course. The resort&#x27;s main restaurants were built along the edge of the lake facing the artificial mountain. Unlike other resorts, the restaurants at Wynn Las Vegas are not accessed directly from the casino. According to Wynn: &quot;People know how to find the casino. They don&#x27;t want to walk out the restaurant door and bump into a slot machine&quot;.

Wynn preferred to avoid absentee chefs who oversaw their restaurants from out of town, instead hiring chefs who were willing to move to Las Vegas. Chefs Daniel Boulud and Paul Bartolotta were among those who signed deals with the resort ahead of its opening. Bartolotta Ristorante di Mare imported 1.5 tons of seafood each week, and was among only a few restaurants in the Western Hemisphere to serve langoustine. Bartolotta departed his restaurant in 2015, and it was renamed Costa di Mare later that year. It closed in 2021.

Wynn Las Vegas has had several Asian restaurants, including Okada, a Japanese eatery named after Wynn&#x27;s business partner Kazuo Okada. It opened along with the resort, and included a sushi bar, a robatayaki grill, and four teppanyaki stations. Takashi Yagihashi served as executive chef. In 2012, Okada was renovated and renamed Mizumi, a common female name in Japan.

Wing Lei also debuted with Wynn Las Vegas, and would become the first Chinese restaurant in the U.S. to receive a Michelin Star. It was designed by Jacques Garcia, and has views of a garden with 100-year-old pomegranate trees. The restaurant emphasized freshness under chef Richard Chen, featuring five tanks full of fish ready to cook. Aside from Wing Lei, most of the resort&#x27;s restaurants store their seafood in tanks located in a chilled cooler beneath the casino floor. The cooler houses approximately 3,000 lobsters each month.

Alex, a French restaurant named after chef Alex Stratta, was among the eateries that opened with the resort. It featured a staircase modeled after one featured in the musical &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; Chef Stratta later opened an Italian restaurant, named &quot;Stratta&quot;. It replaced Corsa Cucina, an Italian-Mediterranean restaurant which initially featured a grand prix racing theme. Alex closed in 2011; a resort representative said that &quot;high-end French dining is not what people want these days&quot;. For five consecutive years leading up to its closure, Alex had won the Forbes Travel Guide Five Star Award and the AAA Five Diamond Award. Stratta&#x27;s other eponymous restaurant closed in 2012, replaced by a new Italian eatery known as Allegro.
&quot;The Buffet at Wynn&quot; was among the most popular in Las Vegas. Because of health concerns during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the buffet switched to a new format in which servers brought food to the diners. After a few months, Wynn Resorts determined that this concept was unpopular among guests, announcing the buffet&#x27;s closure later in 2020. The Buffet at Wynn returned in July 2021, with a traditional buffet format.

La Cave Wine &amp; Food Hideaway was opened by Michael Morton in 2010. It underwent a renovation in 2019, adding a garden lounge. Cipriani, a chain of Italian restaurants, opened a location at the Wynn in 2018. In 2021, the resort added Delilah, a supper club named after an existing establishment in West Hollywood. Delilah&#x27;s design is based on Las Vegas supper clubs of the 1950s. Other dining establishments include Lakeside, a seafood restaurant overseen by chef David Walzog; and Tableau, a fine-dining restaurant. In 2023, chef Alon Shaya is scheduled to open a Mediterranean restaurant at the resort.
===Nightclubs===

Wynn Las Vegas opened with a water-themed nightclub known as La Bete, French for &quot;The Beast&quot;. It served as a restaurant and bar, and would convert to an after-hours club. The club did not meet Wynn&#x27;s expectations, and the resort&#x27;s director of nightclub operations departed less than two weeks after the opening. Victor Drai was hired later that year to revamp La Bete. The club closed for a two-month multimillion dollar renovation, reopening as Tryst on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2005. The new club included more outdoor seating, and was managed by Drai along with brothers Cy and Jesse Waits. Drai departed Wynn Las Vegas in 2010, to pursue other business ventures. Tryst closed in November 2015. It was renovated and reopened in April 2016 as Intrigue, a club which would eventually close three years later.

Another nightclub, Blush, was managed by Sean Christie&#x27;s Las Vegas Nightlife Group. It operated from 2007 to 2011.

===Retail===

The property opened with an indoor boutique shopping area known as Wynn Esplanade, where the use of skylights is prominent. The retail area measures . It opened with 32 shops, including several owned and operated by Wynn Resorts. Notable retailers included Cartier, Chanel, Dior, Louis Vuitton, Vertu, and Graff. Fashion designers Jean Paul Gaultier, Manolo Blahnik, and Oscar de la Renta also opened stores at the resort. In addition, Wynn Las Vegas opened with an employees-only convenience store. It is one of five Strip resorts to have such a feature.
The resort also opened with the Penske Wynn Ferrari Maserati dealership, a joint venture between Wynn Resorts and Penske Automotive Group. It was the only Ferrari and Maserati dealership in the state, and included a showroom with new and used vehicles. The dealership proved to be popular among the general public, prompting the resort to start charging a $10 admission fee. In addition to sales, the dealership also leased vehicles out to hotel guests, and included several maintenance bays for owners.

In 2015, Penske and Wynn Resorts chose not to renew the lease on the dealership, which closed at the end of the year. It was replaced by the Wynn Plaza shopping center, which opened in 2018. It measures , and added 25 upscale retailers, including Breitling SA, Celine, Kiton, Le Labo, Loewe, Omega SA, Stella McCartney, and Rimowa. It is managed by Wynn Resorts and co-owned by Crown Acquisitions.

===Other features===
Upon opening, the resort had a small art gallery with 15 paintings, including Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Le Rêve&quot; and several paintings by Rembrandt and Johannes Vermeer. It closed in 2006 to make way for new retailers, and some of the paintings were then hung around the resort.

Wynn Las Vegas opened with 21 bars. Among them were Parasol Up and Parasol Down, both featuring large parasols that move up and down. The resort also opened with four pools, one of which allowed topless sunbathing.

Convention groups would be a prominent demographic at Wynn Las Vegas, which had of space upon opening. Meeting rooms overlooked the golf course. A two-story addition, built for $423 million, was finished in 2020. It brought the resort&#x27;s total convention space to .

In 2014, a statue of cartoon character Popeye was put on display in the resort. Wynn paid $28 million for the statue, which is made of stainless-steel and weighs 2,000 pounds. In 2019, the statue was relocated out of state to another resort, Encore Boston Harbor. The newly added convention space features a sculpture by artist Okuda San Miguel.

Blue Wire, a sports podcast platform, began operating in a $3.5 million studio at the resort in 2021.
==Live entertainment==

===&quot;Le Rêve&quot; and &quot;Awakening&quot;===
Wynn Las Vegas&#x27; primary production show was &quot;Le Rêve&quot;, titled after the resort&#x27;s original name. The aquatic-themed show was directed by Franco Dragone, who previously worked with Wynn to create &quot;Mystère&quot; (at Treasure Island) and &quot;O&quot; (at Bellagio). A 10-year deal was signed for the show, with a 5-year renewal option extending it into 2020. &quot;Le Rêve&quot; featured diving and acrobats. It was performed in the Wynn Theater, which had 2,087 seats, with the farthest seat from the stage. The theater used in the round seating which overlooked a giant central pool used for performances.

&quot;Le Rêve&quot; cost at least $40 million to create, although initial reception was underwhelming, prompting changes to the show. Wynn bought out Dragone&#x27;s interest in 2006 and assumed creative control of &quot;Le Rêve&quot;, making further changes over the years. &quot;Le Rêve&quot; would go on to become one of the most popular shows in Las Vegas. It closed in 2020, due to uncertainty brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.

&quot;Awakening&quot; opened in November 2022, and includes music and choreography, as well as large-scale puppetry. The former &quot;Le Rêve&quot; theater was extensively renovated for &quot;Awakening&quot;, which incorporates a new stage made of dichroic glass and LED screens. The stage is divided into sections which can be raised and rotated. The redesigned theater includes 1,600 seats. &quot;Awakening&quot; closed for a two-week period in February 2023, allowing rehearsals for a slightly revamped version of the show. The changes included new music and clarity in the storyline, which had been a source of criticism. Two months later, the show closed for further changes, reopening in June 2023. The revamped show features updated choreography from dancer Mandy Moore, as well as new costumes.

===&quot;Lake of Dreams&quot;===
&quot;Lake of Dreams&quot; takes place at the resort&#x27;s lake. Several restaurants and lounges overlook the show, which includes a giant head made of steel and fiberglass that rises from the lake to sing. Music is emitted from 100 speakers, and footage is also projected onto a waterfall. In addition, the show features a tall frog who sings and dances. The show was designed by Kenny Ortega and Michael Curry Design. As of 2012, the show had put on 30,000 performances.

A $14 million technological upgrade was completed in 2020, after two years in the works. Ortega and the original creative team returned for the revamp project, which included three new animatronics, measuring in height. The animatronics depict female bird characters who sing a variety of songs by female artists. The frog animatronic, which remains in the show, had only covered songs by male singers.

===Other shows and entertainers===
The Broadway Theater, a separate 1,200-seat venue, was built to host &quot;Avenue Q&quot;, an adult puppet show which opened in 2005. Wynn had seen the show in New York and was enthusiastic about it, believing that it could have a 10-year run at his resort. However, it failed to meet his expectations and was closed in May 2006.

Aside from &quot;Avenue Q&quot;, Wynn had also signed the musical comedy &quot;Spamalot&quot; to perform at the resort. Wynn Las Vegas initially planned to build a third theater, on part of the resort&#x27;s golf course, to host the show. This was scrapped in order to preserve the golf course view for guests. After &quot;Avenue Q&quot; was canceled, &quot;Spamalot&quot; instead took the over the Broadway Theater, which was renamed the Grail Theater. The show ran from March 2007 to July 2008.

By February 2009, the second venue was renamed the Encore Theater, after Wynn&#x27;s new sister property. The theater is located between the two resorts, and has 1,480 seats. Singer, comedian and impressionist Danny Gans began performing in the theater that month as headline entertainer, until his death in May 2009.

Beyoncé held her I Am... Yours concert residency at the Encore Theater during mid-2009, and country singer Garth Brooks periodically performed in the theater from 2009 to 2014, with a residency known as Garth at Wynn. Other notable performers in the Encore Theater have included Whoopi Goldberg, Harry Connick Jr., Robbie Williams, Jo Koy, and Sarah McLachlan.

&quot;Steve Wynn&#x27;s Showstoppers&quot; opened in the Encore Theater in late 2014. The production musical featured 30 singers and dancers. It was directed by Philip McKinley and choreographed by Marguerite Derricks. The show ended in 2016.

==Accolades==
Since its opening, Wynn Las Vegas has been a repeat winner of the AAA Five Diamond Award and the Five Star award from Forbes Travel Guide. Wynn Las Vegas and Encore, along with Wynn Palace in Macau, are the three largest Forbes Five-Star resorts in the world. As of 2009, the two spas at the Wynn complex were also the only ones in the state to have five-star ratings. In 2017, readers of &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot; also named the two Wynn resorts as the best hotel property in Las Vegas, noting the high level of luxury. It has since been a repeat winner as named by readers.

<text>Vincent Edward Scully (November 29, 1927 – August 2, 2022) was an American sportscaster, best known for his broadcast work in Major League Baseball. Scully was the play-by-play announcer for the Brooklyn / Los Angeles Dodgers for sixty-seven years, beginning in 1950 and ending in 2016. He is considered by many to be the greatest sports broadcaster of all time.

Born in the Bronx, New York City, Scully attended Fordham University where he played baseball before becoming a student broadcaster and journalist. After being mentored by Dodgers broadcaster Red Barber early in his career, Scully was hired by the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1950, and moving with them to Los Angeles in 1958. He became known for his distinctive tenor voice and lyrically descriptive style. Scully&#x27;s tenure with the Dodgers was the longest of any broadcaster with a single team in professional sports history. He retired at age 88 after the 2016 season, ending his record-breaking run as the team&#x27;s broadcaster.

In addition to Dodgers baseball, Scully called various nationally televised football and golf contests for CBS Sports from 1975 to 1982, and was the lead baseball play-by-play announcer for NBC Sports from 1983 to 1989. He also called the World Series for CBS Radio from 1979 to 1982 and again from 1990 to 1997.

For his long and distinguished career, Scully was honored with a star of the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame and NAB Broadcasting Hall of Fame. For his services to baseball, he was honored with the Ford C. Frick Award by the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. Prior to his final season, the Dodgers honored Scully by renaming the street leading towards Dodger Stadium to &quot;Vin Scully Avenue&quot;. That same year, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama. After a long illness, Scully died on August 2, 2022, at his home in Hidden Hills, California.

==Early life==
Born in the Bronx, Scully grew up in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan. His father, Vincent Aloysius Scully, was a silk salesman; his mother, Bridget (née Freehill), was a homemaker. He was of Irish descent. His biological father died of pneumonia when Scully was four, and his mother later married an English merchant sailor named Allan Reeve, whom Scully considered &quot;my dad&quot;. He had one sibling, a younger sister who died of brain cancer in 2002, aged 67. Scully attended Fordham Preparatory School in the Bronx. He worked delivering beer and mail, pushing garment racks and cleaning silver in the basement of the Pennsylvania Hotel in New York City.

Scully discovered his love of baseball at age eight when he saw the results of the second game of the 1936 World Series at a laundromat and felt a pang of sympathy for the badly defeated New York Giants, who had lost the game 18–4 to the New York Yankees. Since he lived near the Polo Grounds and because he was a member of the NYC Police Athletic League and Catholic Youth Organization, he was able to attend games for free and became a &quot;very big Giants fan&quot;.

==Broadcasting career==

===Fordham and CBS Radio===
After serving in the United States Navy for two years, Scully began his career as a student broadcaster and journalist at Fordham University, where he majored in English. While at Fordham, he helped found its FM radio station WFUV (which now presents a Vin Scully Lifetime Achievement Award each year), was assistant sports editor for Volume 28 of &quot;The Fordham Ram&quot; his senior year, sang in a barbershop quartet, played center field for the Fordham Rams baseball team, called radio broadcasts for Rams baseball, football, and basketball, earned a degree, and sent about 150 letters to stations along the Eastern seaboard. He received only one response, from CBS Radio affiliate WTOP in Washington, D.C., which hired him as a fill-in.

Red Barber, the sports director of the CBS Radio Network, recruited Scully for its college football coverage. Scully impressed his boss with his coverage of a November 1949 University of Maryland versus Boston University football game from frigid Fenway Park in Boston, despite having to do so from the stadium roof. Expecting an enclosed press box, Scully had left his coat and gloves at his hotel, but never mentioned his discomfort on the air; the game proved an exciting affair that attracted Barber to ask him for further assignments. Barber mentored Scully, and Scully would follow Barber&#x27;s advice on being an impartial announcer without blatant &quot;homer&quot; connections. When the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles, management had approached Scully about taking a pro-Dodger tone now that the team was the only one in its city (as the minor league Los Angeles teams had done) to which Scully responded weeks later by saying he would stick to objective and factual coverage.

===Dodgers (1950–2016)===
====Brooklyn (1950–1957)====
After Ernie Harwell left the Dodgers&#x27; radio and television booths for the crosstown Giants before the 1950 season, Scully replaced Harwell, joining Barber and Connie Desmond.

When Barber got into a salary dispute with World Series sponsor Gillette prior to the 1953 World Series, Scully took Barber&#x27;s spot in the NBC television booth, becoming the youngest person to broadcast a World Series (a record that stands to this day). After Barber subsequently left the Dodgers to work for the New York Yankees beginning in 1954, Scully became the team&#x27;s principal announcer, working with Desmond (1954–56), André Baruch (1954–55), Al Helfer (1955–57), and Jerry Doggett (1957). Scully was in the booth when the Brooklyn Dodgers won the 1955 World Series, their only championship in Brooklyn. He announced Dodgers games in Brooklyn until 1957, after which the club moved to Los Angeles.

====Los Angeles (1958–2016)====
Beginning with the 1958 season, Scully accompanied the Dodgers to their new location and quickly became popular in Southern California. During the Dodgers&#x27; first four seasons in Los Angeles, inexperienced baseball fans had difficulty following the action in the very large Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, and it soon became common for them to bring transistor radios to the games to hear Scully and Jerry Doggett describe the action, a practice that continued even after the team moved to the much smaller Dodger Stadium for the 1962 baseball season. Radio and television engineers often had difficulty compensating for the sound of Scully&#x27;s play-by-play reverberating through the stands at Dodgers home games.

In 1964, the New York Yankees offered Scully the job to replace the recently fired Mel Allen as their lead play-by-play announcer. Scully declined the offer and chose to remain with the Dodgers. By 1976, his popularity in Los Angeles had become such that Dodger fans voted him the &quot;most memorable personality&quot; in the history of the franchise.

Before 1966, local announcers exclusively called the World Series. Typically, the Gillette Company, the Commissioner of Baseball and NBC television would choose the announcers, who would represent each of the teams that were in the World Series for the respective year. For the 1966 World Series, Curt Gowdy called half of each game before ceding the microphone to Vin Scully in Los Angeles, and Chuck Thompson in Baltimore. Scully was not satisfied with the arrangement as he said &quot;What about the road? My fans won&#x27;t be able to hear me.&quot; In Game 1 of the 1966 World Series, Scully called the first 4½ innings. When Gowdy inherited the announcing reins, Scully was so upset that he refused to say another word.

Unlike the typical modern style in which multiple sportscasters have an on-air conversation (usually with one functioning as play-by-play announcer and another as color commentator), Scully and his broadcast partners Jerry Doggett (1956–87) and Ross Porter (1977–2004) each called their innings solo, rotating between radio and television, with Scully working the entire game except for the 3rd and 7th innings. When Doggett retired after the 1987 season, he was replaced by Hall-of-Fame Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale, who previously broadcast games for the California Angels. Drysdale died in his hotel room following a heart attack before a game against the Montreal Expos in 1993, resulting in a very difficult broadcast for Scully and Porter, who were told of the death but could not mention it on-air until Drysdale&#x27;s family had been notified and the official announcement of the death made. Scully announced the news of his death by saying, &quot;Never have I been asked to make an announcement that hurts me as much as this one. And I say it to you as best I can with a broken heart.&quot; Former outfielder Rick Monday succeeded Drysdale in the Dodgers&#x27; broadcast crew.

On August 28, 2015, the Dodgers announced—via a series of cue cards presented by comedian Jimmy Kimmel on the Dodger Stadium video board—that Scully would be back for the 2016 season, his 67th with the Dodgers. At a press conference August 29, Scully said 2016 would probably be his final year. &quot;I mean, how much longer can you go on fooling people? So yeah, I would be saying, &#x27;Dear God, if you give me next year, I will hang it up.

Scully&#x27;s final regular season game broadcast from Dodger Stadium occurred on September 25, 2016, as the Dodgers defeated the Colorado Rockies 4-3 on a walk-off home run by Charlie Culberson to clinch the National League West Division title. His final game was broadcast from San Francisco&#x27;s Oracle Park on October 2, 2016.

===CBS Sports (1975–1982)===
From 1975 to 1982, Scully was employed by CBS Sports, where his most prominent assignment was calling National Football League telecasts. He worked alongside several different color analysts, including Sonny Jurgensen, Paul Hornung, Alex Hawkins, George Allen, Jim Brown, John Madden, and Hank Stram. Scully called Dwight Clark&#x27;s touchdown catch in the NFC Championship Game on January 10, 1982, which put the San Francisco 49ers into Super Bowl XVI. It was the final NFL game he announced. &quot;This was a hell of a game to quit doing football,&quot; he commented.

Scully also contributed to the network&#x27;s PGA Tour golf coverage, usually working with Pat Summerall, Ken Venturi, and Ben Wright. From 1975 to 1982, he was part of the team that covered the Masters Tournament for CBS. He also worked occasional 
tennis events for the network. Scully&#x27;s CBS commitments led to his working a reduced schedule with the Dodgers, who hired Ross Porter to cover for games that Scully couldn&#x27;t call.

Scully also had his first of two stints calling baseball for CBS Radio during this period, broadcasting the All-Star Game from 1977 to 1982 (usually paired with Brent Musburger) and the World Series from to (alongside Sparky Anderson).

====Departure from CBS====
According to CBS Sports producer Terry O&#x27;Neil in the book &quot;The Game Behind the Game&quot;, Scully decided to leave CBS in favor of a job calling baseball games for NBC (beginning in 1983) following a dispute over assignment prominence. CBS decided going into the 1981 NFL season that John Madden, whom CBS had hired in 1979 and who had called games alongside Frank Glieber and Gary Bender his first two years, was going to be the star color commentator of their NFL television coverage. But they had trouble figuring out who was going to be his play-by-play partner, since Scully was in a battle with CBS&#x27; lead play-by-play announcer Pat Summerall for the position. At the time Scully was the number two announcer for CBS, a position he had held since 1975, and was calling games alongside the former Kansas City Chiefs head coach Hank Stram, who had been promoted from CBS&#x27; number three broadcast team alongside Curt Gowdy.

To resolve the situation, both Scully and Summerall were paired with Madden in four-week stretches, which coincided with each of their respective absences due to other engagements. While Summerall was away calling the US Open tennis tournament for CBS as he did every September, Scully called the first four weeks of the season alongside Madden. After that Scully went on to cover the National League Championship Series and World Series for CBS Radio, as he had done for the past few Octobers, and Summerall returned to the broadcast booth to work with Madden. Scully then teamed with Stram for the remainder of the NFL season.

After the eighth week of the NFL season, CBS Sports decided that Summerall meshed more with Madden than Scully did and it named him to be the announcer who would call Super Bowl XVI for CBS on January 24, 1982, at the Pontiac Silverdome. An angry Scully, who felt that his intelligence had been insulted by the move, was assigned as a consolation prize that year&#x27;s NFC Championship Game, which he called alongside Stram. Summerall took Stram&#x27;s place alongside Jack Buck to call the game over CBS Radio.

===NBC Sports (1983–1989)===
Outside of Southern California, Vin Scully is best remembered for his stint as NBC Sports&#x27; lead play-by-play announcer for its Major League Baseball coverage from 1983 to 1989. In addition to working Saturday &quot;Game of the Week&quot; telecasts for NBC, Scully called three World Series (1984, 1986, and 1988), four National League Championship Series (1983, 1985, 1987, and 1989), and four All-Star Games (1983, 1985, 1987, and 1989). Scully also reworked his Dodgers schedule during this period, broadcasting the team&#x27;s home games on radio and road games on television, with Fridays and Saturdays off so he could work for NBC. During his stint at NBC, Scully provided the call for one of baseball&#x27;s most memorable plays when Bill Buckner made a tenth-inning error in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series against the New York Mets. Scully also called Kirk Gibson&#x27;s famous home run during Game 1 of the 1988 World Series.

Teaming with Joe Garagiola (who was the full-time lead play-by-play man for NBC&#x27;s baseball telecasts from 1976 to 1982 before converting into a color commentary role to work with Scully) for NBC telecasts (except in 1989, when he was paired with Tom Seaver after Garagiola left NBC Sports following the 1988 World Series due to a contract dispute), the pair were on hand for several key moments in baseball history: Fred Lynn hitting the first grand slam in All-Star Game history (1983); the 1984 Detroit Tigers winning the World Series (along the way, he called Tigers pitcher Jack Morris&#x27; no-hitter against the Chicago White Sox on April 7); Ozzie Smith&#x27;s game-winning home run in Game 5 of the 1985 National League Championship Series; the New York Mets&#x27; miracle rally in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series; the 1987 All-Star Game in Oakland, which was deadlocked at 0–0 before Tim Raines broke up the scoreless tie with a triple in the top of the 13th inning; the first official night game in the history of Chicago&#x27;s Wrigley Field (August 9, 1988); Kirk Gibson&#x27;s game-winning home run in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series; and chatting with former President of the United States Ronald Reagan (who said to Scully, &quot;I&#x27;ve been out of work for six months and maybe there&#x27;s a future here.&quot;) in the booth during the 1989 All-Star Game in Anaheim as Bo Jackson hit a lead-off home run.

On Saturday, June 3, 1989, Scully was doing the play-by-play for the NBC &quot;Game of the Week&quot; in St. Louis, where the Cardinals beat the Chicago Cubs in 10 innings. Meanwhile, the Dodgers were playing a series in Houston, where Scully flew to be on hand to call the Sunday game of the series. However, the Saturday night game between the teams was going into extra innings when Scully arrived in town, so he went to the Astrodome instead of his hotel. He picked up the play-by-play, helping to relieve the other Dodger announcers, who were doing both television and radio, and broadcast the final 13 innings (after already calling 10 innings in St. Louis), as the game went 22 innings. He broadcast 23 innings in one day in two different cities.

Laryngitis prevented Scully from calling Game 2 of the 1989 National League Championship Series between the San Francisco Giants and Chicago Cubs. Bob Costas, who was working the American League Championship Series between Oakland and Toronto with Tony Kubek for NBC, was flown from Toronto to Chicago to fill in that evening (an off day for the ALCS). After the 1989 season, NBC (along with ABC, with whom NBC had shared baseball coverage since 1976), lost the television rights to cover Major League Baseball to CBS. For the first time since 1946, NBC did not televise baseball. In the aftermath, Scully said of NBC losing baseball, &quot;It&#x27;s a passing of a great American tradition. It is sad. I really and truly feel that. It will leave a vast window, to use a Washington word, where people will not get Major League Baseball and I think that&#x27;s a tragedy.&quot;

Scully also served as an announcer for NBC&#x27;s golf coverage from 1983 to 1990, usually teaming with Lee Trevino.

===After NBC (1990–2016)===
After the National League Championship Series in 1989, Scully&#x27;s NBC contract was up and he left to focus primarily on his duties with the Dodgers. Scully also returned to being the national radio announcer for the World Series, since CBS Radio gave him the position that Jack Buck had vacated in order to become the primary announcer for CBS&#x27;s television coverage of Major League Baseball. Scully worked the event from through , teaming with Johnny Bench for the first four years and Jeff Torborg for the final three. After ESPN Radio acquired the World Series radio rights from CBS in 1998, Scully was offered a continued play-by-play role but declined. The final World Series game that Scully called was Game 7 of the 1997 World Series between the Florida Marlins and Cleveland Indians.

From 1991 to 1996, Scully broadcast the annual golf Skins Game for ABC. He also called the Senior Skins Game for ABC from 1992 to 2000, as well as various golf events for TBS during this period. In 1999, Scully was the master of ceremonies for &quot;Major League Baseball All-Century Team&quot; before the start of Game 2 of the World Series.

For health reasons, Scully no longer called most non-playoff games played east of Denver beginning around 2005. He missed most of the Dodgers&#x27; opening homestand of the 2012 MLB season (the first five out of six games) because of an illness, returning to the announcers&#x27; booth on April 15, 2012, which was the 65th anniversary of Jackie Robinson&#x27;s breaking of the color barrier in baseball. It was only the second time that Scully had missed a Dodger Stadium home opener in his career with the team; the first time was when he was busy broadcasting the Masters golf tournament for CBS in 1977.

By his final season in 2016, Scully called approximately 100 games per season (all home games and select road games in San Francisco, San Diego, and Anaheim) for both flagship radio station KLAC and television outlet SportsNet LA. Scully was simulcast for the first three innings of each of his appearances, then announced the remaining innings only for the TV audience. If Scully was calling the game, Charley Steiner took over play-by-play on radio beginning with the fourth inning, with Rick Monday as color commentator. If Scully was not calling the game, either Joe Davis or Steiner would call the entire game on television with Orel Hershiser and Nomar Garciaparra on color commentary, while Monday, now doing play-play, joined Kevin Kennedy on radio.

=== Retirement ===
On January 31, 2016, Scully announced that he planned to retire from broadcasting after the conclusion of the 2016 season; his final game was the team&#x27;s October 2 finale at San Francisco. Scully left open the possibility of calling postseason games (but not the World Series) if the Dodgers were to advance; in September, however, Scully stated that he would retire after the end of the regular season and not call postseason games because he did not want to &quot;say goodbye 12 different times&quot;. Scully was assigned a total of six road games for the 2016 season: the opening game in San Diego, two games in Anaheim, and the entirety of the three-game regular-season closing series in San Francisco.

Scully was honored by the Dodgers during their September 23 home game against the Rockies, which featured a pre-game ceremony that paid tribute to his career. The ceremony included speeches by Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred, Sandy Koufax, Clayton Kershaw, Mayor Eric Garcetti, the team&#x27;s Spanish play-by-play man Jaime Jarrín (who took over Scully&#x27;s distinction as the longest-tenured broadcaster in 2017), Kevin Costner, and Scully himself. The team also unveiled that Kirk Gibson&#x27;s 1988 World Series home run had been named the most memorable Vin Scully call in a fan vote.

His final home game was on September 25, 2016, against the visiting Colorado Rockies. The Dodgers ended up winning on a 10th inning walk-off home run by Charlie Culberson and in doing so clinched the NL West Division title. The final broadcast of his career was the Dodgers&#x27; October 2 game at AT&amp;T Park against the San Francisco Giants. Scully&#x27;s commentary during his final game was simulcast in its entirety on radio, instead of only the first three innings. After the game, he offered a prayer and a final message:

The following season, the Dodgers advanced to the World Series for the first time in 29 years. Despite many Dodgers fans petitioning Scully to come out of retirement, including Fox Sports announcer Joe Buck (who was quoted as saying, &quot;I swear on my late father, to have Vin come do some of the series with us and in my place would be an honor&quot;), Scully declined, preferring to keep a low profile and responding that &quot;I&#x27;ve done enough of them.&quot; Scully did, however, take part in the first pitch ceremony prior to Game 2 with Steve Yeager and Fernando Valenzuela, teammates on the Dodgers team that won the 1981 World Series.

In 2020, he was auctioning sports memorabilia in part to donate to neuromuscular research. After the Dodgers World Series win in 2020, it was announced that Scully would narrate the team&#x27;s year-end championship documentary.

===Other appearances===
In 1970, ABC Sports producer Roone Arledge tried to lure Scully to his network to call play-by-play for the then-new &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; games, but Scully&#x27;s commitment to the Dodgers forced him to reject the offer.

Besides his sportscasting work, Scully was the uncredited narrator for the short-lived NBC sitcom &quot;Occasional Wife&quot;. Scully also co-hosted the Tournament of Roses Parade with Elizabeth Montgomery for ABC in 1967, served as the host for the NBC game show &quot;It Takes Two&quot; in 1969–70, and in 1973 hosted &quot;The Vin Scully Show&quot;, a weekday afternoon talk-variety show on CBS. In 1977, he hosted the prime-time &quot;Challenge of the Sexes&quot; for CBS.

Scully was the announcer in the popular Sony PlayStation-exclusive &quot;MLB&quot; video game series by 989 Sports for a number of years. Scully retired from announcing for video games after &quot;MLB 2005&quot;. Matt Vasgersian, Eric Karros, and Steve Lyons (and formerly Dave Campbell and Rex Hudler) took over as the lead announcers in the video game series, which was retitled &quot;MLB: The Show&quot;. Scully appears as himself in the 1999 film &quot;For Love of the Game&quot;, has a brief cameo (along with then-Dodgers partner Jerry Doggett) in the 1961 film &quot;Bachelor in Paradise&quot;, appears as a CBS news reporter in the 1960 film &quot;Wake Me When It&#x27;s Over&quot;, provides the opening narration in the 1966 film &quot;Fireball 500&quot;, and can be heard calling baseball games in the films &quot;Experiment in Terror&quot; (1962), &quot;Zebra in the Kitchen&quot; (1965), &quot;The Party&quot; (1968), &quot;Fever Pitch (2005 film)&quot;, &quot;The Bucket List&quot; (2007), and &quot;Licorice Pizza&quot; (2021), as well as in episodes of TV series including &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;Alcoa Premiere&quot;, &quot;Mister Ed&quot;, &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot;, and &quot;Brooklyn Bridge&quot;. The surname of the Dana Scully character on the television show &quot;The X-Files&quot; is an homage to Vin Scully, as the show&#x27;s creator Chris Carter is a Dodgers fan; Scully himself can be heard calling a game in the Season 6 episode &quot;The Unnatural&quot;.

In 1965, Scully recorded two spoken word songs as part of the album &quot;The Sound of the Dodgers&quot;: &quot;What Is A Dodger?&quot; and &quot;The Story Of The L. A. Dodgers&quot;.

====Impersonators====
Harry Shearer impersonated Scully in a sketch for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and has used the voice for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; when the storyline includes the fictional team the Springfield Isotopes.

San Francisco Giants broadcaster Jon Miller is known for his impersonation of Scully.

===Awards and honors===

Scully received the Ford Frick Award from the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. He was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Emmy Award for sportscasting, and was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1995. The National Sports Media Association (formerly the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association) named Scully as National Sportscaster of the Year four times (1965, 1978, 1982, 2016) and California Sportscaster of the Year 33 times, and inducted him into its Hall of Fame in 1991. He was the 1992 Hall of Fame inductee of the American Sportscasters Association, which also named him Sportscaster of the Century (2000) and top sportscaster of all-time on its Top 50 list (2009). The California Sports Hall of Fame inducted Scully in 2008. Scully was inducted into the NAB Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 2009. On May 11, 2009, he was awarded the Ambassador Award of Excellence by the LA Sports &amp; Entertainment Commission.

On an episode of MLB Network&#x27;s series &quot;Prime 9&quot;, about the nine greatest baseball broadcasters of all time, Scully was named No. 1.

Scully has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6675 Hollywood Blvd. Since 2001, the press box at Dodger Stadium has been named for Scully, and a street within the team&#x27;s former Dodgertown spring training facility in Vero Beach, Florida was named &quot;Vin Scully Way&quot;.

WFUV, the Fordham University radio station that Scully helped found, presents an annual Vin Scully Lifetime Achievement Award for sports broadcasting. Scully himself was the inaugural recipient of the award in 2008.

Scully served as the Grand Marshal for the 2014 Tournament of Roses Parade. Also, he participated aboard the Los Angeles Dodgers&#x27; 50th anniversary float in the 2008 Tournament of Roses Parade.

On September 5, 2014, Bud Selig presented Scully with the Commissioner&#x27;s Historic Achievement Award. He was the 14th recipient and (after Rachel Robinson) second non-player to receive the award, which was created to recognize accomplishments and contributions of historical significance to the game of baseball.

Several honors were bestowed in 2016, Scully&#x27;s final year. On January 29, the Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously to rename Elysian Park Avenue, which changed the address of Dodger Stadium to 1000 Vin Scully Ave. July 8 was dubbed &quot;Vin Scully Day&quot; by the acting governor of California, Kevin de León. During the pre-game ceremony on September 23, 2016, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti presented Vin Scully with the key to the city. On November 22, Scully received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor given by the President of the United States.

In 2017, Scully&#x27;s commentary for the final Brooklyn Dodgers/New York Giants game in 1957 was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. Also in 2017, Scully won the Icon Award as part of that year&#x27;s ESPY Awards ceremony.

At Game 2 of the 2017 World Series, being played at Dodger Stadium, Scully participated in a pre-game ceremony; addressing the crowd over the PA system, he implied that he was about to throw the ceremonial first pitch, and introduced Steve Yeager to serve as a ceremonial catcher. However, Scully then claimed that he could not actually pitch because he had hurt his rotator cuff, resulting in him introducing the actual ceremonial pitcher, Fernando Valenzuela. Scully also uttered his famous introduction, &quot;It&#x27;s time for Dodger baseball!&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1972, Scully&#x27;s 35-year-old wife Joan Crawford died of an accidental medical overdose; the couple had been married for 15 years. In late 1973, he married Sandra Hunt, who had two children of her own, and they soon had a child together. Scully&#x27;s eldest son, Michael, died in a helicopter crash at the age of 33 while working for the ARCO Transportation Company. He was inspecting oil pipelines for leaks near Fort Tejon, California, in the immediate aftermath of the 1994 Northridge earthquake.

Although Michael&#x27;s death still haunted him, Scully, a devout Roman Catholic, said in numerous interviews that he credited his religious faith and being able to dive back into his work with helping him ease the burden and grief from losing his wife and son. He encouraged devotion to the Virgin Mary, saying, &quot;Her prayers are more powerful than those of the rest of heaven combined. No one was closer or more devoted to Christ on earth, so it only makes sense to see the same thing in heaven. Now, the Blessed Virgin seeks to help her spiritual children get home to spend eternity with her Son.&quot; In 2016, Scully narrated an audio recording of the Rosary for Catholic Athletes for Christ in which he recites the Rosary mysteries and leads a group of responders.

In November 2017, Scully stated that he would &quot;never watch another NFL game again,&quot; due to some of the league&#x27;s players kneeling during the playing of the national anthem prior to games.

Scully had four children, two stepchildren, twenty-one grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren. He resided in Thousand Oaks, California, and attended St. Jude the Apostle Church in Westlake Village, California. He was a second cousin of the former Lord Mayor of Dublin, Mary Freehill.

Scully and his second wife Sandra were married for 48 years until Sandra&#x27;s death from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis on January 3, 2021.

===Death===
On August 2, 2022, Scully died at home in Hidden Hills, California, at age 94. His funeral was held at St. Jude the Apostle Roman Catholic Church, in Westlake Village, California, on August 8.

Upon his death, Rob Manfred, the Commissioner of Baseball, released a statement:

The Dodgers had just beaten the San Francisco Giants at Oracle Park when Scully&#x27;s death was announced by public address announcer Renel Brooks-Moon. The Giants, who had been Scully&#x27;s favorite team growing up, paid tribute to Scully on their video board while the Dodgers team gathered on the field.

Afterwards, Dodger fans left tributes to Scully at the entrance of Dodger Stadium where the address bore his name. Broadcasters, sports teams, politicians, and athletes paid tribute to Scully as well.

On August 6, the Dodgers held a pre-game ceremony during which a tribute video was played and photo montage was shown. Outside the television booth, from where Scully broadcast games, hung a banner saying &quot;We&#x27;ll miss you&quot;. Manager Dave Roberts ended the pre-game ceremony with Scully&#x27;s iconic catch phrase: &quot;It&#x27;s time for Dodger baseball!&quot;

<text>USS &quot;Skipjack&quot; (SSN-585), the lead ship of her class of nuclear-powered attack submarine, was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named after the Skipjack tuna.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Skipjack&quot;′s keel was laid down on 29 May 1956 by the Electric Boat Division of the General Dynamics Corporation at Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 26 May 1958, sponsored by Helen Mahon, wife of Representative George H. Mahon from the 19th District of Texas, and commissioned on 15 April 1959 with Commander W. W. Behrens, Jr., in command. 

==Advances in submarine design==

On the &quot;Skipjack&quot;, there were many design changes that were products of new scientific insight into submarine design. The submarine industry, now with nuclear power, had wanted to make a &quot;true&quot; submarine. This required a design in its element underwater, not solely one theoretically able to remain submerged indefinitely. The greatest alteration was the new tear-drop hull, pioneered by the conventionally powered USS Albacore, and designed for optimum performance underwater. The Albacore was the world underwater speed record holder in 1966 at 34.8 knots, around 40 mph, outpacing all nuclear powered Subs. The new hull&#x27;s only protrusions were the sail and diving planes. The 23-foot sail, resembling a shark&#x27;s dorsal fin, rose at a point midway in the hull to keep the ship stable. The diving planes, similar in function to the wings of an airplane, were moved from the hull to this new sail, with the periscopes and antenna masts. Thus, they could be useful only when the submarine is in its natural environment—like the control surfaces on an airplane. Also, a single propeller behind the rudder now propelled &quot;Skipjack&quot;, making it more maneuverable.

Other experiments in design also benefited &quot;Skipjack&quot; by allowing the vessel to be built with improved steel. Areas from the control room (featuring push-button control of pneumatic and trim systems), to the anchor (streamlined to reduce drag and flow noise) were changed in the development of the new submarine. To power the new class, the Westinghouse S5W reactor plant was introduced, the third generation of submarine reactors since the launch of the . The improved core life allowed the ship to travel at full power for 90,000 to . Nuclear power had already been employed on the Nautilus and the follow-on Skate class, but the 15,000 SHP plant was such an advance that it entirely changed a submarine&#x27;s capability. Furthermore, although the S5W reactor was thirty percent bigger than the S1W plant on &quot;Nautilus&quot;, the reactor compartment on &quot;Skipjack&quot; occupied but twenty feet of the ship&#x27;s total length. (This reactor proved so successful that it became the &quot;standard&quot; reactor plant for almost all submarines until the Los Angeles class.) Finally, the design of the core was such that it became the new standard of accessibility.

&quot;Skipjack&quot; had such advanced underwater capabilities that her path could be compared to an airplane in flight. As earlier private inventors like John P. Holland had envisioned, the submarine was designed as having its natural environment underwater, and became capable of things never before seen.

==After launch==
The boat&#x27;s motto was &quot;Radix Nova Tridentis&quot;, meaning &quot;Root of the New Sea Power&quot;; and correctly so, as every US attack submarine until 1988 (when the diving planes moved back to the bow on the improved Los Angeles class) turned out to follow the Skipjack&#x27;s design.

After being launched 26 May 1958, &quot;Skipjack&quot; was soon dubbed the&quot; &quot;world&#x27;s fastest submarine&quot;, &quot;after setting the speed record on sea trials in March of the following year. It was designed to have a speed in excess of 20 knots, but its actual speed was a guarded secret. However, the rated reactor power in shaft horsepower (15,000 shp) and reasonable assumptions about the hull&#x27;s coefficient of drag, cross sectional area, and appendage drag can be combined via algebra to show that the vessel should have reached 31 knots submerged. This speed was some 9 knots faster than the &quot;Nautilus&quot; made using the same basic reactor, and only 2 knots shy of the &quot;Albacore&quot;&#x27;s best theoretical submerged speed (33 kn).

&quot;Skipjack&quot;&#x27;s maneuver capabilities, furthermore, added a whole different dimension to ASW problems as she could reverse direction in the distance of her own length, and were referred to as &quot;flying&quot;, as &quot;Skipjack&quot; and her sister ships climbed, dove, and banked like an airplane. The antisubmarine warfare (ASW) problems created by such maneuverability and high sustained speeds took several decades to resolve to parity.

Shorter than following classes, &quot;Skipjack&quot; lacked the space to be upgraded with newer systems, meaning that in her later years she had second-class sonar equipment and fire-control systems. Despite these limitations, she remained an effective attack submarine through to the end of her career. She received a new seven-bladed propeller during a refit between 1973 and 1976—replacing the noisier five-bladed propeller with which she had set a trans-Atlantic underwater crossing record in an early return from a forward deployment in the Mediterranean – quieted her considerably but also reduced her speed noticeably.

==1960s==
During her shakedown cruise in August 1959, she became the first nuclear ship to pass through the Strait of Gibraltar and operate in the Mediterranean. Following post-shakedown availability at Groton, Connecticut, the nuclear submarine conducted type training and participated in an advanced Atlantic submarine exercise from May through July 1960, which earned the submarine a Navy Unit Commendation, and also a Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; award, an award it would receive three more times.

In late 1960, &quot;Skipjack&quot; violated Soviet territorial waters by sailing up Kola Bay while submerged. She passed within of a pier at Murmansk. The submarine&#x27;s location data recorder was deliberately disabled to prevent the incursion from producing an official record. Upon returning from this mission, &quot;Skipjack&quot; spent the remainder of 1960 in a restricted yard of availability and upkeep.

&quot;Skipjack&quot; commenced her 1961 operations by participating in two weeks of type training followed by anti-submarine warfare exercises through August, visiting Mayport, Florida, before returning to Groton.

In January 1962, &quot;Skipjack&quot; operated out of Key West, Florida, for two weeks before entering the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine for extensive overhaul, lasting four and one-half months. Following her return to New London, Connecticut, the submarine operated locally prior to departing in October for duty in the Mediterranean with the Sixth Fleet. During this tour, &quot;Skipjack&quot; participated in various fleet and NATO exercises and visited Toulon, France; and La Spezia and Naples, Italy, before returning to New London. In this year, the Skipjack also conducted the fastest submerged transit of the Atlantic Ocean on record, which is a record that still stands.

The year 1963 was occupied in submarine attack operations and ASW exercises, all designed to test the capabilities of the nuclear-powered attack submarine. The highlight of 1964 was two months of duty with NATO forces, participating in exercises &quot;Masterstroke&quot; and &quot;Teamwork&quot; and visiting Le Havre, France, and the Isle of Portland, England, before returning to New London in October.

After devoting most of 1965 to training exercises, the submarine ended the year by entering the Charleston Naval Shipyard in South Carolina for an overhaul that lasted until 18 October 1966. &quot;Skipjack&quot; then got underway for sea trials off Charleston, before joining for four days of type training in the Jacksonville, Florida, area. She then sailed to her new home port, Norfolk, Virginia, before participating in Atlantic Fleet exercises.

Early in February 1967, &quot;Skipjack&quot; got underway for sonar and weapon tests and then participated in Atlantic submarine exercises from March through June. July and August were spent in restricted availability at the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company following which &quot;Skipjack&quot; took part in FIXWEX G-67, an exercise designed to evaluate fixed wing ASW aircraft against a submarine with &quot;Skipjack&quot;&#x27;s characteristics. Following an extended deployment in October and November, the submarine returned to Norfolk to prepare for major operations of that year which she completed on 25 February 1968. The remainder of 1968 was spent in local operations in the Norfolk area.

On 9 April 1969, &quot;Skipjack&quot; commenced an overhaul in the Norfolk Naval Shipyard which was completed in the fall of 1970. After sea trials in December 1970, &quot;Skipjack&quot; returned to her regular duties.

==1970s==
Highlights of 1971 were sound trials and weapons system tests at the Atlantic Fleet Range, Puerto Rico, from 25 January through 5 March and NATO exercise &quot;Royal Night&quot; from 15 September to 9 October. On 22 October, &quot;Skipjack&quot; returned to Norfolk, where she remained through January 1972.

&quot;Skipjack&quot; spent most of 1972 in tests and type training out of Groton, Connecticut and Norfolk, VA as well as the Caribbean. The submarine returned to Norfolk in late 1972.

Toward the end of spring in 1973, &quot;Skipjack&quot; returned to the Mediterranean Sea and conducted several exercises with the Sixth Fleet. During that time &quot;Skipjack&quot; was home ported at La Maddalena on the NE corner of Sardinia. Returning to Norfolk in September &quot;Skipjack&quot; crossed paths with Hurricane Ellen during the Atlantic transit. Down in the subsurface calm, the crew were hardly even aware of the turbulence above them.

After returning to Norfolk, &quot;Skipjack&quot; conducted several exercises with ASW aircraft flying from air bases in Virginia and North Carolina. In these exercises &quot;Skipjack&quot; played the role of a Russian submarine; ASW forces were to locate, track and conduct simulated attacks against the &quot;Skipjack&quot;. During the exercise, &quot;Skipjack&quot; was placed under certain handicaps that would not have been present in normal operations; for instance, she was restricted to a designated operating area measuring 20 miles by 10 miles. Also, at that time, &quot;Skipjack&quot; had a noise problem in her reduction gears. ASW crews were provided the sound profile of the reduction gears; in addition, &quot;Skipjack&quot; was required to generate a unique sound signal at all times. This was done so the ASW crews could be certain they were targeting the right submarine and not accidentally launch a simulated attack on a real Russian submarine. As a result of all these safety measures and restrictions, the ASW forces were able to locate &quot;Skipjack&quot; nearly 50 percent of the time.

At the end 1973 &quot;Skipjack&quot; was transferred to the submarine base at Groton in preparation for a refueling overhaul at General Dynamics&#x27; Electric Boat Division. After conducting a few more exercises, &quot;Skipjack&quot; entered the shipyard for overhaul in the summer of 1974.

Skipjack completed the overhaul and a follow-on dry docking by the summer of 1977.
Following a change of command, Skipjack proceeded to the Autec range for a series of shakedown and certification exercises. Skipjack then deployed to the Mediterranean in October, 1977, returning in March 1978.

Later that year, Skipjack completed a 59 day ASW exercise northern Atlantic, with a stop in Holy Loch, Scotland. The ship then conducted a surface transit down Irish Sea to Plymouth, England, before returning to Groton.

Late in 1978, Skipjack again deployed to the Mediterranean, returning late spring of 1979. During this period, Skipjack was awarded the Comsubron 2 Battle Efficiency “E.”

==1980s==

From early December 1979 to mid-February 1980, Skipjack engaged in NATO exercises in the North Atlantic and stopped in Halifax, Nova Scotia for Christmas 1979. During these operations, Skipjack survived a major North Atlantic hurricane that resulted in some loss of life among the NATO fleet with which she operated. After returning to her homeport of Groton in late February 1980 for a short time, she then deployed for further ASW exercises in February with the Atlantic Fleet and for her Mark 48 qualifications in the Caribbean stopping in Cocoa Beach, Florida (Cape Canaveral) and Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico. The remainder of the Spring of 1980 was spent in short ops and a short drydock refit in Groton.

In June 1980, Skipjack deployed to the Caribbean, the South Atlantic, and the South Pacific as part of UNITAS that year. During UNITAS, she engaged in ASW operations with ships of the Atlantic Fleet and from various South American Navies requiring she transit the Panama Canal into the Pacific and then return. She stopped in Port Everglades, Fl.(Ft. Lauderdale, Fl.); Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico; Rodman, Panama; Callao, Peru; Manta, Ecuador; Puerta La Cruz, Venezuela; Barbados; St. Kitts; and Curaçao. It was while operating in the Caribbean that Skipjack collided with an underwater mound. After an in-port inspection by divers and an official Navy inspection team sent down from Groton, she was allowed to complete her UNITAS run. However, because the mound was on sea charts, Commander Plath was removed from command and the run was completed by her new commanding officer Petersen.

After returning from UNITAS to Groton in September 1980, she spent the rest of the year in short ops and a refit including a short drydock in preparing for her transit to the Pacific Fleet for overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, CA. She left for the Pacific Fleet in early December, engaging in some ASW exercises along the way. During this transit she stopped in Fort Lauderdale and Rodman again and then at San Diego, CA before arriving at Mare Island in late January 1981. She spent the rest of 1981 and into 1982 in extensive overhaul at Mare Island.

In 1986, &quot;Skipjack&quot; deployed on a &quot;Northern Run&quot; to the North Atlantic Ocean.

In 1987 &quot;Skipjack&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean Sea, returning in early September and entering dry-dock for the September – November time frame. In early 1988, &quot;Skipjack&quot; visited St. Croix, Port Canaveral, Florida, Bermuda, and Halifax Harbour, Nova Scotia; the last two port calls conducted during an exercise. In late April, &quot;Skipjack&quot; departed Groton, traveling to the south. During this underway, sister diesel submarine USS Bonefish (SS-582) experienced a disastrous fire. TV news broadcast reports of the fire with film; however, news studio editors failed to identify the submarine televised. Wives of the Skipjack&#x27;s crew noticed the sub bore strong resemblance to the &quot;Skipjack&quot;, leading many to believe it was the &quot;Skipjack&quot; suffering the casualty.

&quot;Skipjack&quot; had a change of command during the summer of 1988 and the crew prepared for a UNITAS cruise to South America. &quot;Skipjack&quot; left in September and visited the Naval Base in Puerto Rico; Caracas, Venezuela (anchored out); Cartagena, Colombia and then transited the Panama Canal. While at a Naval Base on the Pacific side, one motor-generator suffered an unrepairable casualty. &quot;Skipjack&quot; left UNITAS, re-transited the canal and headed to Groton, where she entered dry-dock for repairs.

&quot;Skipjack&quot;&#x27;s authorization to dive expired in March 1989 since it was not cost efficient to inspect the hull in 1987 for a ship scheduled to be decommissioned. She had just been to St. Croix and some of the return trip was conducted on the surface. From March thru June, &quot;Skipjack&quot; provided bridge training to students at the Submarine Officer Basic School in Groton, mostly running up and down the river. During one trip out of the sound the anchor got stuck. Divers were called out from Groton to cut the anchor chain and retrieve the anchor. &quot;Skipjack&quot; entered dry-dock for the third time in three years to have the anchor fixed, at a cost of about $75K. &quot;Skipjack&quot; left Groton in early July to transit to Norfolk. After arrival &quot;Skipjack&quot; provided support vessel services for another submarine&#x27;s sea trials. Following this mission, &quot;Skipjack&quot; entered NNSDDCO in October for decommissioning.

==Decommissioning in 1990==
&quot;Skipjack&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 19 April 1990, having served for 31 years in the US Navy. ex-&quot;Skipjack&quot; entered the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program in Bremerton, Washington, on 17 March 1996. Recycling was completed on 1 September 1998.

<text>USS &quot;Scamp&quot; (SSN-588), a &quot;Skipjack&quot;-class nuclear-powered submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the scamp, a member of the fish family Serranidae.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Scamp&quot;′s keel was laid down on 23 January 1959 at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California. She was launched on 8 October 1960, sponsored by Mrs. John C. Hollingsworth, widow of Commander John C. Hollingsworth, the commanding officer of at the time of her loss in November 1944 during World War II. She was commissioned at Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 5 June 1961 with Commander W. N. Dietzen in command.

== Operational history ==
=== 1960s ===
&quot;Scamp&quot;’s first four months in the fleet were taken up by advanced trials and training exercises in the Bremerton, Washington, San Diego, California, and Pearl Harbor, areas. Following these operations, she returned to Vallejo, California, for post-shakedown availability at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Leaving the shipyard &quot;Scamp&quot; completed her final acceptance trials and began local operations in the San Diego area. During training the sub lost her screw off the coast of California on 4 December 1961 and was towed back to Mare Island by the Coast Guard Cutter USCGC Comananche WMEC-202 ( built for the USN as ATA-202 in 1944) In April 1962 she deployed to the western Pacific, returning to San Diego in July. She operated locally until September, when she departed on another extended training cruise. &quot;Scamp&quot; returned to San Diego and local operations until February 1963 when she entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard for interim drydocking. She refloated in March and, in April, deployed again to the western Pacific. While in the Far East, she conducted another extended period of advanced training, including operations in the Okinawa area. &quot;Scamp&quot; reentered San Diego Bay in October 1963. She resumed her West Coast operations out of San Diego until June 1964, then, she headed west again for advanced readiness training. She arrived back in San Diego in September 1964.

&quot;Scamp&quot; entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard again in January 1965 for extensive modification. In June 1966 after the installation of the SUBSAFE package and overhaul, she left Mare Island and returned to training cruises in the San Diego operating area. In November she ventured north to Puget Sound for a month of operations and returned to San Diego in December. The nuclear submarine operated out of San Diego for the first six months of 1967. On 28 June, she departed San Diego to join the Seventh Fleet in the western Pacific. She remained in the Far East, participating in fleet operations along the Vietnamese coast, until returning to San Diego on 28 December 1967.

&quot;Scamp&quot; operated out of San Diego in the local operating area from January to May 1968. On 11 May, she arrived at Pearl Harbor to conclude an extended training cruise. She returned to San Diego on 19 May and remained there until 15 June, when the submarine shifted to San Francisco to enter Mare Island Naval Shipyard for a three-week restricted availability. She returned to San Diego on 16 July and finished out the year sailing from that port on various exercises and training cruises.

&quot;Scamp&quot; continued stateside duty throughout 1969. She alternated in-port periods with training cruises until early March when she began pre-overhaul tests in the San Diego operating area. She continued preparing for overhaul and participating in exercises until 1 November when she entered Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for regular overhaul. While at Bremerton, &quot;Scamp&quot; was assigned that port as her new home port. The overhaul continued through 1970 and ended in January 1971.

=== 1970s ===
Following post-overhaul sea trials in Puget Sound, &quot;Scamp&quot; was reassigned back to San Diego, as home port on 12 February 1971, but did not enter that port until 16 April after a voyage to Pearl Harbor. On 27 July, she deployed to the western Pacific. &quot;Scamp&quot; stopped at Pearl Harbor from 2 August to 13 August, then headed on to Subic Bay, arriving on 30 August. For the bulk of 1971, she operated with the Seventh Fleet in Far Eastern waters other than off the coast of Vietnam, except for one short two-day period, 8 October and 9 October.

She returned to San Diego on 2 February 1972, but following the North Vietnamese Easter Offensive, redeployed to the Seventh Fleet in May. She operated in the South China Sea for most of the summer, returning to San Diego on 1 August. Upon arrival, she went into a two-month standdown period, followed by more than a month of restricted availability at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. She departed Puget Sound on 28 November, conducted weapons system accuracy tests, and returned, on 11 December, to San Diego, where she remained for the remainder of the year.

&quot;Scamp&quot; operated locally around San Diego until 29 March 1973. At that time, she departed the West Coast for deployment to the Far East. She stayed at Pearl Harbor between 5 and 10 April, then headed for Yokosuka, Japan. She arrived in Japan on 23 April and operated with the Seventh Fleet until 1 September, when she departed Guam for Pearl Harbor. &quot;Scamp&quot; stopped at Pearl Harbor during the period 10 to 15 September, then set sail for San Diego. Arriving on 21 September the nuclear submarine immediately entered a period of standdown and upkeep until 1 November, when she resumed operations in the vicinity of San Diego.

&quot;Scamp&quot; participated in UNITAS XIX 

=== 1980s ===
&quot;Scamp&quot; was home ported in Groton Naval Submarine Base New London, Connecticut during the early 80s. She deployed for five months to the Mediterranean Sea from October 1982, to March 1983. During this time, &quot;Scamp&quot; was sent to the Libyan coast, where she monitored the shoreline, and the military activity thereon, while protecting the aircraft carrier (possibly the JFK???) which had purposefully violated the &quot;Line of Death&quot; Muammar Gaddafi drew far into International Waters. This incursion earned many men inclusion into the VFW, whether they know it or not.

By the end of 1983, she had earned her second BATTLE EFFICIENCY SERVICE AWARD.

In July 1984, &quot;Scamp&quot; participated in UNITAS XXV with South America.

During a storm in the North Atlantic on 24 February 1987, while attempting to rescue members of the crew of the sinking Philippine freighter, MV &quot;Balsa 24&quot;, &quot;Scamp&quot; suffered flooding and damage to her sail which led to her early retirement. The sub saved the life of one crew member, 18 others perished.

== Decommissioning ==
&quot;Scamp&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 April 1988. ex-&quot;Scamp&quot; entered the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program in Bremerton, Washington, in 1990 and on 9 September 1994 became the first hulk to complete the program and ceased to exist.

== Honors and awards ==

* Meritorious Unit Commendation with two stars (3 awards)
* Navy E Ribbon
* Vietnam Service Medal with three campaign stars for Vietnam War service

&quot;Scamp&quot; earned her first Navy E Ribbon in 1977 and her second in 1983. She received her Meritorious Unit Commendations in 1971 and 1972 and for service on 24 February 1987.

<text>USS &quot;Sculpin&quot; (SSN-590), a &quot;Skipjack&quot;-class nuclear-powered submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sculpin.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Sculpin&quot;′s keel was laid down on 3 February 1958 by Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi. She was launched on 31 March 1960, sponsored by Mrs. Fred Connaway, widow of Commander Fred Connaway, who was killed while commanding the first during World War II, and commissioned on 1 June 1961 with Commander C. N. Mitchell in command.

==Operational history==

===1960s===
&quot;Sculpin&quot; departed Pascagoula on 8 June for her designated home port, San Diego, California. Following her arrival there, she began a period of shakedown training. In July, she held special trials and tests in the Puget Sound area and then returned to San Diego for type training. In August, &quot;Sculpin&quot; cruised to Pearl Harbor for two weeks before returning to San Diego. She operated off the West Coast before entering the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for post-shakedown availability in October. This was completed in late March 1962, and &quot;Sculpin&quot; returned to her home port.

Following training operations, in early May she deployed for the western pacific visiting Pearl Harbor and then continued her special operations in the western Pacific, upon completing operations visited Naha, Okinawa and Pearl Harbor returning to San Diego in August. The nuclear submarine participated in local training operations, ordnance evaluation projects, and fleet exercises until entering the Mare Island Naval Shipyard in early January 1963 for a hull survey. &quot;Sculpin&quot; returned to San Diego at the end of the month, conducted type training for two months and, on 29 March, got underway for a dependents&#x27; cruise. The submarine returned to Mare Island in April for restricted availability and remained there until August when she returned to San Diego and commenced local operations. She was the first submarine leaving Mare Island after the Thresher Disaster.

&quot;Sculpin&quot; was in Pearl Harbor, in early December, en route to the western Pacific, when defective piping forced her to sail back to Mare Island for repairs. She returned to San Diego on 25 February 1964, and operated from that port until early April. On 8 April, &quot;Sculpin&quot; sailed for duty with the Seventh Fleet. Prior to reporting, she made port calls at Pearl Harbor, Sydney, and Subic Bay. For the remainder of her deployment, &quot;Sculpin&quot; operated in and out of Subic Bay, and Naha, Okinawa, with the Seventh Fleet. She returned to her home port on 20 October 1964 and was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for her deployment. Operations and exercises along the west coast, from San Diego to Bangor, Washington, occupied the submarine for the next 25 months.

On 27 November 1966, &quot;Sculpin&quot; stood out of San Diego for Naha and another tour with the Seventh Fleet. She returned to her home port on 11 May 1967 and began conducting local operations. The submarine had an extended training cruise from 27 July to 26 October and, on 11 November, gave a demonstration dive for President of the United States Lyndon B. Johnson.

On 31 December, &quot;Sculpin&quot; was notified that she was due for drydock and overhaul at Puget Sound, and she sailed for that destination on 2 January 1968. This was &quot;Sculpin&quot;&#x27;s first major overhaul and refueling since commissioning, seven years before, and she was in drydock from 30 January 1968 to 22 January 1969. Sea trials and training lasted until 26 July when she sailed to Pearl Harbor on a shakedown training cruise. She returned to the West Coast on 22 August and began an upkeep period at San Diego which lasted until 8 September. The submarine operated along the California coast until 6 February 1970 when she got underway for Pearl Harbor and deployment to the western Pacific.

===1970s===
&quot;Sculpin&quot; sailed from Pearl Harbor on 21 February and entered Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 6 March. She also visited Subic Bay, Hong Kong, and Yokosuka before returning to San Diego on 21 August. She conducted local operations until 4 January 1971 when she began a three-month restricted availability period at Mare Island. The yard work was completed on 16 April, and the submarine returned to San Diego. The only interruption of her schedule came in October when she sailed to Puget Sound to have her bottom sand blasted and painted.

&quot;Sculpin&quot; returned to San Diego on 13 November 1971 and began preparing for a secret deployment to track gun smuggling trawlers in the South China Sea. The deployment began on 5 January 1972 and on 10 April 1972 &quot;Sculpin&quot; lay in wait south of the Chinese island of Hainan. After having spotted its target the &quot;Sculpin&quot; followed the smugglers for 2,500 miles to the Southern coasts of South Vietnam, where on 24 April a South Vietnamese destroyer escort under the direction of &quot;Sculpin&quot; sank the Chinese trawler. With its mission a success the &quot;Sculpin&quot; returned to port on 24 July.

She was berthed at San Diego for the remainder of the year, with only 15 days being spent at sea.

On 2 February 1973, &quot;Sculpin&quot; entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for a three-month restricted availability. After leaving the yard in May, the submarine operated along the Pacific coast under the command of Captain James Joseph Pistotnik, until 12 November when it arrived at San Diego and began preparing for a deployment in early January 1974. &quot;Sculpin&quot; sailed from San Diego on 7 January for Pearl Harbor and the western Pacific on an extended cruise.

In 1975 the &quot;Sculpin&quot; entered drydock for a refueling overhaul in Bremerton, Washington and following completion of the overhaul, she returned to San Diego.

Most of 1977 was spent doing weekly operations out of San Diego and recovering from the overhaul that was completed in the early part of that year. At the completion of one such operation &quot;Sculpin&quot; had returned and tied up to the tender, and was broadsided by the &quot;USS Snook SSN 592&quot; while &quot;Snook&quot; was trying to tie up next to &quot;Sculpin&quot;. &quot;Snook&quot; suffered damage to her bow tube outer doors and had to spend the next 6 weeks in drydock for repairs, forcing &quot;Sculpin&quot; back to sea to pick up &quot;Snook&#x27;s&quot; operating schedule.

&quot;Sculpin&quot; participated in the RIMPAC exercise during April and May 1978, which included port call in Pearl Harbor. In June 1978, &quot;Sculpin&quot; left San Diego and headied south. She traversed the Panama Canal on the 2nd of July, followed by a memorable port call at Willemstad, Curaçao. From there she continued North to her new home port, Groton, Connecticut. During the fall of that year, she participated in the Northern Wedding Exercises with a stop at Holy Loch Scotland for repairs. The ship returned to Groton for the Holiday Season and the crew got their first taste of Winter in New England.

In February 1979 the boat left Groton for operations in the Mediterranean.

:&quot;History from 1974 to 1981 needed.&quot;

In 1982 the boat completed a non-refueling overhaul in Mare Island Naval Shipyard. During sea trails, it experienced severe angles while completing a crashback maneuver while submerged. It recovered and made its way to San Diego, then went to its home port in Groton, Ct. (Subron 2) via the Panama Canal. After shakedowns and short cruises in 1983, in 1984 Sculpin served in the Mediterranean performing picket duty between Syria and the USS New Jersey as the New Jersey shelled Lebanon (a consequence of the 1983 bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut.

==Decommissioning==
&quot;Sculpin&quot; was decommissioned on 3 August 1990 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 August 1990. Her final Captain was Cmdr. J. B. Allen. &quot;Sculpin&quot; was decommissioned at Newport News Naval Shipyard with ceremonies occurring at Norfolk Naval Base prior to the shipyard event. ex-&quot;Sculpin&quot; entered the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program in Bremerton, Washington, on 1 October 2000 and on 30 October 2001 ceased to exist.

<text>USS &quot;Shark&quot; (SSN-591), a &quot;Skipjack&quot;-class submarine, was the seventh ship of the United States Navy to be named for the shark.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Shark&quot;′s keel was laid down on 24 February 1958 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia. She was launched on 16 March 1960, sponsored by Mrs. Louis Shane, Jr., and commissioned on 9 February 1961 with Lieutenant Commander John F. Fagan, Jr., in command.

==Operational history==
===1960s===
After preliminary testing and fitting out, &quot;Shark&quot; sailed to the Caribbean Sea in May 1961 for her shakedown cruise. The submarine returned to her building yard for post-shakedown repairs and final acceptance by the Navy.

&quot;Shark&quot; sailed for the Mediterranean Sea and duty with the Sixth Fleet on 12 August 1961. This was the first deployment in the area for a nuclear submarine, and &quot;Shark&quot; was deployed there until 14 November 1961.

In the September–October phase of the tour, &quot;Shark&quot; visited Athens, Greece (Piraeus) and hosted the entire Greek Royal family aboard for a cruise both above and underwater.

On 29 January 1962, the submarine steamed to Bermuda in the British West Indies, for two weeks of type training. She was next deployed to the North Atlantic from 15 March to 23 May. During this period, &quot;Shark&quot; paid a one-week visit to Portsmouth, England. On 25 August, she departed for another two months in the North Atlantic. On her return trip to Norfolk, Virginia, she underwent an availability period that lasted until 7 January 1963.

&quot;Shark&quot; participated in SUBFALLEX in the North Atlantic from 7 August to 24 October, with a week spent in Faslane, Scotland. The remainder of 1963 was either spent in port, in local operations, or conducting antisubmarine warfare exercises in the Caribbean.

On 22 March 1964, &quot;Shark&quot; departed Norfolk to participate in SUBSPRINGEX and returned on 21 May. On 25 June 1964, she sailed to Charleston, South Carolina, for her first shipyard overhaul which lasted until 7 June 1965. On 7 April 1965, at the shipyard, &quot;Shark&quot; was presented the Navy Unit Commendation for meritorious service from 5 April to 9 May 1964, a period in which she &quot;achieved results of great value and importance to the United States Navy in the field of antisubmarine warfare capabilities.&quot;

The submarine put to sea for sea trials on 7 June. One month later, she suffered damage to the forward oxygen system which necessitated additional repairs at Charleston, South Carolina. On 9 October, she passed her sea trials and sailed to Key West, Florida, for two weeks of torpedo tube tests and a wire-guided torpedo development project.

&quot;Shark&quot; returned to Norfolk on 25 October 1965 and conducted type training, individual ship exercises, and antisubmarine warfare exercises until 8 January 1966. The boat then operated in the Caribbean until 7 February. She was there again for further trials in July and October.

&quot;Shark&quot; stood out of Norfolk on 7 January 1967 for the North Atlantic and conducted special operations until 24 March. Two weeks of this period were spent at Holy Loch, Scotland. On 12 April, she was presented her second Navy Unit Commendation for operations in 1966 in which &quot;&quot;Shark&quot; contributed significantly to the knowledge of the United States Navy in the field of antisubmarine warfare.&quot; &quot;Shark&quot; departed Norfolk on 16 May for Halifax, Nova Scotia, which was the first visit of a nuclear ship to a Canadian port. The submarine operated with Royal Canadian Navy ASW units before returning to her home port.

In 1967 &quot;Shark&quot; was used in a Naval Department educational film for training and public relations.

On 11 June 1967, &quot;Shark&quot; prepared for her first refueling period at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard and did not put to sea again until March 1968. The remainder of 1968 and 1969 was spent performing local or special operations.

===1970s===
&quot;Shark&quot; was in drydock at Norfolk from 1 January 1970 to 9 August 1971. The remainder of the year and 1972 was spent in refresher training and undergoing various trials along the East Coast, with the exception of a deployment to the Sixth Fleet from 31 May to 19 November 1972.

:&quot;Mare Island Naval Shipyard for overhaul September 1981 to May 1983. Returned to New London Connecticut.&quot;
:&quot;History from 1972 to 1986 needed.&quot;

She would take part in another deployment with the Atlantic Fleet in 1974 before returning to Pascagoula for a reactor refueling in August. This refueling and overhaul would take more than two years.

When &quot;Shark&quot; returned to the ocean, her home port was changed to New London, Connecticut. In 1978, &quot;Shark&quot; had a busy schedule, taking part in UNITAS exercises with a number of South American navies and deploying to Mediterranean as part of the Sixth Fleet. In 1980, &quot;Shark&quot; took part in exercises with the Atlantic Fleet and the Royal Canadian Navy.

==Decommissioning==
&quot;Shark&quot; was deactivated, in commission, and formally decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 September 1990. &quot;Shark&quot; was the last &quot;Skipjack&quot; to be taken out of service. She entered the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program in Bremerton, Washington, on 1 October 1995 and on 28 June 1996 ceased to exist.

<doc id="753625" wikidata="Q5968252" url="?curid=753625" title="USS Snook (SSN-592)">
<text>USS &quot;Snook&quot; (SSN-592), a &quot;Skipjack&quot;-class submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the common snook, an Atlantic marine fish that is bluish-gray above and silvery below a black lateral line.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Snook&quot;′s keel was laid down by Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, on 7 April 1958. She was launched on 31 October 1960, sponsored by Mrs. George L. Walling, mother of Commander John F. Walling, who was commanding officer of the first when she was lost in action in World War II. &quot;Snook&quot; was commissioned on 24 October 1961 with Commander Howard Bucknell III in command.

==Operational history==

===1960s===
Following shakedown in the Puget Sound area, &quot;Snook&quot; departed San Diego, California, on 23 June 1962 to deploy as a unit of the Seventh Fleet in the western Pacific, returning home on 21 December. On 1 February 1963, the submarine entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California, for extensive improvements of her hull. After leaving Mare Island on 23 August, &quot;Snook&quot; operated in the San Diego area until deploying to the western Pacific to join the Seventh Fleet, following which she again entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard for three and one-half months of repairs and the installation of new electronic equipment.

After participating in local operations in the San Diego area, &quot;Snook&quot; departed on 19 March 1965 for a six-month deployment in the western Pacific. Highlights of this tour were calls at Sasebo, Japan, and Chinhae, South Korea. For this deployment, the &quot;Snook&quot; earned the Navy Unit Commendation. After returning to San Diego, &quot;Snook&quot; spent the next six months undergoing sound trials and drydocking, and on 16 April 1966, headed for the western Pacific. During this deployment, she visited Okinawa, Yokosuka and Sasebo, Chinhae, and Subic Bay, Philippines, before returning to San Diego on 19 November.

On 19 March 1967, &quot;Snook&quot; got underway from San Diego for Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, and a 14-month overhaul and refueling. On 30 June 1968, the submarine returned to San Diego and participated in local operations, including the sinking as a target of former auxiliary submarine ex-&quot;Archerfish&quot; (AGSS-311).

&quot;Snook&quot; spent the first four months of 1969 participating in various antisubmarine warfare exercises and preparing for overseas deployment. In May, she once again departed for the western Pacific for a deployment that lasted seven months, returning home on 22 December.

===1970s===
Late in January 1970, &quot;Snook&quot; participated in exercise &quot;Uptide&quot; with other units of the First Fleet. From June through September, she was drydocked at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Following return to San Diego, the submarine sailed for a six-month deployment with the Seventh Fleet, returning to San Diego on 12 July 1971. &quot;Snook&quot; spent the remainder of the year in port and in operations off the California coast.

Operating locally in the San Diego area through the first four months of 1972, &quot;Snook&quot; got underway on 13 May for a two-month tour supporting United States forces in Vietnam and visiting Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Following drydocking at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, &quot;Snook&quot; got underway on 10 January 1973 for her eighth deployment with the Seventh Fleet. During this deployment, &quot;Snook&quot; visited Pearl Harbor and Guam.

She returned to San Diego on 16 June and began a four-week, postdeployment leave and upkeep period, followed by another four weeks engaged in sonar evaluation tests. On 26 November, following her participation in COMTUEX 12-73, &quot;Snook&quot; entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard to begin a refueling overhaul.

==Decommissioning==
&quot;Snook&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 14 November 1986, and entered the nuclear-powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program in Bremerton, Washington, and was scrapped between 1 October 1996 and 30 June 1997.

<doc id="753634" wikidata="Q723531" url="?curid=753634" title="Nissim of Gerona">
<text>Nissim ben Reuven (1290 – 9th of Shevat, 1376, ) of Girona, Catalonia was an influential talmudist and authority on Jewish law. He was one of the last of the great Spanish medieval Talmudic scholars. He is also known by his Hebrew acronym, the RaN (), or else with the definite article HaRaN (), as well as by the name RaNbaR (), the Hebrew acronym of his full name, including his father&#x27;s name, Reuven (), and also by Nissim Gerondi.

==Biography==
Nissim was born in Barcelona, Catalonia. He was a physician and had knowledge of astronomy. His teacher is not known; his works refer to a R. Perez as &quot;morenu&quot; (&quot;our teacher&quot;), but as he refers to his father (Reuben ben Nissim) as &quot;my father and teacher&quot; perhaps his father was his primary teacher.

He served as a judge and teacher for the Jewish community in Barcelona, and founded a yeshiva there. He criticized the wealthy members of the community for their behavior, but this provoked a hostile backlash from them. He suffered at the hands of certain wealthy and powerful Jews of his community, who even slandered him and other leading rabbis before the government, and they were even imprisoned for a period of five months before their innocence was proven. When the Spanish Jews combined to send a petition to the king entreating his protection, Nissim was one of the committee who drafted the document.

His closest students were the Isaac ben Sheshet and Hasdai Crescas.

==Scholarship==
===Commentary on Alfasi===
His best-known work is his commentary and explanation of Isaac Alfasi&#x27;s &quot;Sefer Ha-halachot&quot;, which had, at that time, been adopted for practical decisions. He is very detailed and explicit where the subject is important from a practical point of view, but extremely brief when dealing with theory. &quot;Ran&quot; did not write the commentary on all of Alfasi, although the whole commentary is often ascribed to him. 

In his comments he did not hesitate to refute the greatest earlier authorities, such as Rashi, Rabbenu Tam, Maimonides, Nachmanides, and Solomon ben Aderet. However, he showed his reverence for these teachers by adopting their opinions in practise. Frequently, he would refute the opinion of an earlier teacher but then write: &quot;Yet since the ancients have decided thus, their conclusions may not be set aside.&quot; According to his student Isaac ben Sheshet, he was generally very cautious in his decisions and inclined toward conservatism.

In his commentaries Nissim endeavored to establish the decisions relating to practise, and he devoted himself to the explanation and defense of Alfasi&#x27;s &quot;Halakot,&quot; since that compendium had been adopted for practical decisions. The extant commentaries of Nissim on the &quot;Halakhot&quot; cover the treatises Shabbat, Pesaḥim, Ta&#x27;anit, Rosh ha-Shanah, Beẓah, Sukkah, Megillah, Ketubot, Giṭṭin, Ḳiddushin, Shebu&#x27;ot, and Avodah Zarah. Commentaries on Mo&#x27;ed Katan and Makkot are erroneously ascribed to him. He is very detailed and explicit where the subject is important from a practical point of view, but extremely brief when dealing with matters of mere theory. The commentary is now printed with &quot;Alfasi&quot; in standard editions of the Talmud.

===Commentary on the Talmud===
Nissim also wrote commentaries on the Talmud itself. A scholarly edition of the surviving commentaries has been published in recent years. In these works also Nissim sought to determine the practical decisions, and at the end of nearly every exposition and explanation of any length he summed up whatever was of importance for practical purposes. He was the first to write a complete commentary on the treatise Nedarim; and this part of his work is the most valuable portion of the collection, since this treatise was neglected in the geonic period, and the later glosses on it left much to be desired.

===Responsa===
He was recognized as a rabbinical authority even beyond Spain, and rabbinical questions (&quot;she&#x27;elot&quot;) were addressed to him not only from his own country, but also from France, Italy, Africa, and the Land of Israel. He wrote in reply about 1,000 responsa, of which only 77 have been preserved. These show his insight and his rationalistic method of treating halakhic material. His responsa were first published at Rome (1546), and were reprinted at Constantinople (1548) and, in an enlarged form, at Cremona (1557).

===Other works===
He wrote a philosophical work containing twelve homilies (&quot;derashot&quot;), displaying in this small volume his familiarity with philosophy, especially with that of Maimonides and Ibn Ezra. He was &quot;no friend of mysticism&quot;, and even reproved Nahmanides for devoting too much time to the Kabbalah.

He also wrote a recently published commentary on the Bible, and a work of philosophy.

<doc id="753644" wikidata="Q737976" url="?curid=753644" title="Bradley Center">
<text>The Bradley Center (also known as the BMO Harris Bradley Center under sponsorship agreements) was a multi-purpose arena located on the northwest corner of North Vel R. Phillips Ave. and West State Streets in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States.

It was home to the Milwaukee Bucks of the NBA and the Marquette University men&#x27;s basketball team. It was also the home of the Milwaukee Wave of the MISL, from 1988 to 2003, the original Milwaukee Mustangs of the AFL from 1994 to 2001, along with the second incarnation of the team from 2009 to 2012, the Badger Hockey Showdown from 1989 to 2002, and the Milwaukee Admirals of the AHL (and formerly of the IHL) from 1988 to 2016.

The arena employed about 50 full-time employees, mostly tradespeople, and about 700 part-time employees to help during events.

Following the opening of the new Fiserv Forum in late August 2018, the Bradley Center was demolished to make way for future development. Assets from the arena, including display boards, scoreboards, equipment and sports and concert memorabilia were auctioned off.

==History==
The arena opened on October 1, 1988, with an exhibition hockey game between the Chicago Blackhawks and the Edmonton Oilers. At $90 million, it was meant to be a modern replacement of its current cross-street neighbor, The MECCA (now the UW–Milwaukee Panther Arena), built in 1950. The arena was built as an attempt to attract an expansion franchise for the National Hockey League, though this never occurred, and the International Hockey League&#x27;s Milwaukee Admirals (later moving to the American Hockey League) used the arena for the majority of its existence. The MECCA, during much of its time operating as an NBA facility, had the league&#x27;s smallest seating capacity, holding just over 11,000 people. Funds to build the Center were donated as a gift to the State of Wisconsin by broadcaster/Admirals owner Lloyd Pettit and his wife, Jane Bradley Pettit, in memory of Jane&#x27;s late father, Harry Lynde Bradley of the Allen-Bradley company; the latter was noted upon the arena&#x27;s exterior with subtle decorative outlines, hinting of its trademark octagonal logo.

Despite being one of the premier NBA facilities when completed in 1988, it was one of the oldest active NBA arenas by the end of the Bucks&#x27; tenancy in 2018, only behind Madison Square Garden in New York City, and Oakland Arena, although both had been extensively renovated during the Bradley Center&#x27;s lifetime, and the latter was replaced by the Chase Center in San Francisco in 2019. The donation from the Pettits did not include provisions for the building&#x27;s long-term capital needs or annual operating expenses. While the facility was self-sufficient, its tenants had been at a disadvantage compared with other NBA teams due to the arrangement in the arena&#x27;s later years.

For several years, former Bucks owner and former U.S. Senator Herb Kohl proposed constructing a new, state-of-the-art downtown arena, but the community reaction to the idea of a publicly funded arena was mostly negative. In 2009, Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle included a provision in the state&#x27;s capital budget seeking $5 million in state bonding support to renovate the Bradley Center. The Bradley Center&#x27;s board of directors told state officials that the building needs $23 million in renovations, so they reportedly agreed to raise the remaining $18 million on their own.

During the summer of 2010, the arena&#x27;s longtime Sony Jumbotron scoreboard was replaced with a new 3.5-million-pixel LED unit manufactured by TS Sports and Lighthouse Technologies, and was put into service in October 2010 at the start of the Admirals season. Unlike many other NBA and NHL scoreboards, the bottom panel also has an LED screen, allowing display of many images above the floor itself rather than a static image of a sponsor or team logo.

On May 21, 2012, the Bucks&#x27; then-owner Herb Kohl and representatives from BMO Harris Bank announced that the bank had officially purchased the naming rights for the Bradley Center, and it would now be called the &quot;BMO Harris Bradley Center&quot;. The last game at the Bradley Center was an NBA playoff game won by the Bucks over the Celtics, 97–86, on April 26, 2018. 

The arena&#x27;s final public event was a Bon Jovi concert on April 29, 2018, while the arena&#x27;s final overall event was the annual meeting of Northwestern Mutual Life&#x27;s agents and beneficiaries from July 20 through July 24, 2018, concluding with a private concert by the Zac Brown Band.

===Replacement and demolition===

On September 18, 2013, then-deputy NBA commissioner Adam Silver toured the arena and found it unbefitting of an NBA team. Silver said that the building was a few thousand square feet short of NBA standards, and also lacked numerous amenities. The NBA issued a mandate requiring the Bucks to relocate, or be close to completion of a new facility by 2017.
On April 16, 2014, Bucks&#x27; owner Herb Kohl announced an agreement to sell the franchise to New York City hedge-fund investors Marc Lasry and Wesley Edens. The deal included provisions for $100 million each from Kohl and the new ownership group, for a total of $200 million, toward the construction of a new downtown arena.

On July 15, 2015, the Wisconsin Senate approved funding for the new Fiserv Forum by a 21-10 margin, and on July 28, 2015, the Wisconsin State Assembly approved funding by a 52-34 margin. On August 12, 2015, Governor Scott Walker signed the arena spending plan at Wisconsin State Fair Park in West Allis, Wisconsin.

During the summer of 2016, the Admirals moved to the Panther Arena and the Bradley Center was modified to allow normal operation for two years while making space for the construction of the new arena to the north. The arena&#x27;s icemaking plant and HVAC buildings were demolished and the arena&#x27;s cooling facilities moved to a smaller facility away from the construction site. With the arena hosting no further hockey games, portable icemaking equipment was used for its last two ice events, the 2017 and 2018 runs of Disney on Ice. Other modifications included a temporary loading dock and trash disposal facilities on the east side of the building.

Over $1 million in electrical equipment, luxury suite furniture, and bathroom fixtures from the Bradley Center was donated to the Local 494 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the Milwaukee chapter of Habitat for Humanity, and Milwaukee Public Schools. Due to the arena&#x27;s close proximity to adjacent buildings, including the Fiserv Forum and the historic Turner Hall, the arena was deconstructed over a period of nine months. The Bucks still own the Bradley Center site for future development. Exterior demolition of the arena began in the spring of 2019, starting at the northwest corner of the structure. Demolition contractors used explosives to cut the steel structure, but not enough to trigger an implosion of the entire arena due to the nearby presences of Turner Hall and the &quot;Journal Sentinel&quot; building. On January 13, 2019 the roof of the Bradley Center was imploded. The final standing part of the Bradley Center was felled on May 31, 2019. Bucks officials state that redevelopment of the Bradley Center site would not start until after the 2020 Democratic National Convention takes place. As of August 2020, due to COVID-19, redevelopment of the site will likely not commence until 2021.

During the Bucks&#x27; run to the NBA Finals in 2021, the Bradley Center site was used as part of the viewing parties in the Deer District for the Bucks&#x27; playoff games. For the Bucks&#x27; game 6 victory in the Eastern Conference Finals, the Fiserv Forum&#x27;s plaza and the Bradley Center site had over 65,000 fans in total watching the game.

The Bradley Center was host to World Wrestling Entertainment events since February 1989 (then WWF) when it hosted The Main Event II, where the Mega Powers of Macho Man Randy Savage and Hulk Hogan disbanded, setting up a match between the two stars at WrestleMania V. Shortly thereafter, WWE&#x27;s ratings fell and they began using the smaller MECCA for shows.

In the early 2000s, WWE returned to the Bradley Center for pay-per-views No Way Out (2002), which saw the debut of the NWO, Taboo Tuesday (2004), Elimination Chamber (2012), and Fastlane (2017). The Bradley Center also regularly hosted episodes of &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot;.

The BMO Harris Bradley Center also played host to the first UFC event in Wisconsin: UFC Live: Hardy vs. Lytle on August 14, 2011. UFC 164 was also held at the arena on August 31, 2013.
