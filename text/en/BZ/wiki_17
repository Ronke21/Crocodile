<text>Amores perros is a 2000 Mexican psychological drama film directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu (in his feature directorial debut) and written by Guillermo Arriaga, based on a story by them both. &quot;Amores perros&quot; is the first installment in González Iñárritu&#x27;s &quot;Trilogy of Death&quot;, succeeded by &quot;21 Grams&quot; and &quot;Babel&quot;. It makes use of the multi-narrative hyperlink cinema style and features an ensemble cast. The film is constructed as a triptych: it contains three distinct stories connected by a car crash in Mexico City. The stories centre on a teenager in the slums who gets involved in dogfighting; a model who seriously injures her leg; and a mysterious hitman. The stories are linked in various ways, including the presence of dogs in each of them.

The title is a pun in Spanish; the word &quot;perros&quot;, which literally means &quot;dogs&quot;, can also be used to refer to misery, so that it roughly means &#x27;bad loves&#x27; with canine connotations. The film was released under its Spanish title in the English-speaking world, although it was sometimes translated as &quot;Love&#x27;s a Bitch&quot; in marketing. The soundtrack includes songs by Latin American rock bands including Café Tacuba, Control Machete, and Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas.

&quot;Amores perros&quot; premiered on May 14, 2000 at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival and went on a Mexican release on June 16, 2000. &quot;Amores perros&quot; was a Mexican commercial and critical success and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2000 and won the Ariel Award for Best Picture from the Mexican Academy of Film. &quot;Amores perros&quot; has been considered one of the best Mexican films by many. Filmmaker Denis Villeneuve praised &quot;Amores perros&quot; as one of the best films of the 21st century.

In December 2020, &quot;Amores perros&quot; was remastered by The Criterion Collection.

==Plot==
The film is constructed from three distinct stories linked by a car crash that brings the characters briefly together.

===&quot;Octavio y Susana&quot;===
Octavio (Gael García Bernal) is in love with his brother&#x27;s wife Susana (Vanessa Bauche) and dislikes the way she is abused by his brother Ramiro (Marco Pérez). Octavio tries to persuade her to run away with him. Local thug Jarocho, happy after winning in a dog fight, lets his dog loose on some strays and is threatened by a homeless guy wielding a machete. Eventually, Jarocho sics his dog on Octavio&#x27;s rottweiler, Cofi, but his own dog is killed instead. Octavio and his friend Jorge, realising Cofi&#x27;s potential, become involved in the dogfighting scene. Octavio makes enough money to flee with Susana, and pays Mauricio, the owner of the dogfighting venue, to get Ramiro beaten up. Afraid, Ramiro steals the money and leaves with Susana. Struggling financially, Octavio accepts a challenge by Jarocho to participate in a private dogfight, with no outside bets. Cofi is about to win, but Jarocho shoots him. The infuriated Octavio stabs Jarocho in the stomach. Pursued by Jarocho&#x27;s thugs, Octavio finds himself in a car chase with Jorge and the wounded Cofi. A collision follows; Jorge dies and Octavio is badly injured.

===&quot;Daniel y Valeria&quot;===
Magazine publisher Daniel (Álvaro Guerrero) leaves his family to live with his lover Valeria (Goya Toledo), a Spanish supermodel. On the day they move in together, Valeria&#x27;s leg is severely broken in Octavio&#x27;s car crash and she is unable to continue working as a model. As Valeria is recuperating in Daniel&#x27;s apartment, her dog Richie disappears under a broken floorboard and becomes trapped. The missing dog triggers tension and arguments for the couple, leading to doubts about their relationship on both sides. Trying to rescue the dog, Valeria again injures her leg; Daniel finds her hours later. Valeria&#x27;s new leg injury results in severe arterial thrombosis and eventually gangrene. Her leg is amputated. While she is in the hospital, Daniel finally rescues Richie from the floorboards. When she returns, Valeria drives her wheelchair through the torn-up lovenest and looks out of the window expecting to see a billboard bearing her likeness, only to find it has been removed.

===&quot;El Chivo y Maru&quot;===
The homeless guy occasionally seen in Octavio&#x27;s story is revealed to be a professional hitman called El Chivo (Emilio Echevarría). He is a former private school teacher who was imprisoned after committing terrorist acts for guerrilla movements. He is trying to make contact with his daughter, Maru, whom he abandoned when he began his guerrilla involvement and who believes that he is dead. He is about to perform a hit on a businessman when Octavio&#x27;s car crash interrupts him. During the chaos at the car crash, he steals Octavio&#x27;s money and takes the wounded Cofi to his warehouse hideout to nurse the dog back to health. One day, while El Chivo is out, Cofi kills all the other mongrel dogs El Chivo is caring for. He is about to kill Cofi, but decides against it. Meanwhile, Octavio&#x27;s brother Ramiro is shot and killed during an attempted bank robbery.

At Ramiro&#x27;s funeral, Octavio meets Susana, and again attempts to convince her to run away with him, but she angrily rejects the notion. A few days later, Octavio is shown waiting at the bus station for Susana. She never shows up, and Octavio does not board the bus. El Chivo learns that his client and his intended victim are half-brothers. He leaves both men alive and chained to separate walls with a pistol within reach between them, their fate left uncertain. He then breaks into his daughter Maru&#x27;s house and leaves her a large bundle of money along with a message on her answering machine explaining what happened to him. When he is about to tell Maru that he loves her, the answering machine stops recording. He then goes to an autoshop, where he sells the client&#x27;s SUV. The mechanic asks him the dog&#x27;s name, and El Chivo calls him &quot;Negro&quot; (&quot;Black&quot;). After El Chivo receives the money for the car, he and Negro walk away, disappearing into the horizon.

==Cast==
==Themes==

=== Dogs and disloyalty ===
Each of the three tales is a reflection on the cruelty of humans towards both animals and other humans, showing how humans may live dark or even hideous lives. But the film&#x27;s theme is loyalty, as symbolized by the dog, &quot;man&#x27;s best friend&quot;. Dogs are important to the main characters in each of the three stories, and in each story various forms of human loyalty or disloyalty are shown: disloyalty to a brother by trying to seduce the brother&#x27;s wife, disloyalty to a wife by keeping a mistress with subsequent disloyalty to the mistress when she is injured and loses her beauty, loss of loyalty to youthful idealism and rediscovered loyalty to a daughter as a hit-man falls from and then attempts to regain grace.

Dogfighting is banned in all Latin American countries but exists as an element of the underground economy. Although violent, dogfighting provides an opportunity for Octavio to make money. This is true to life in the sense that participating in the underground economy gives people in the lower class the ability to make money and experience mobility. González Iñárritu was heavily criticized for his inclusion of dogfighting in the film but has claimed that although it is horrible, dogfighting is one of the harsh realities of Mexico City.

===Inequality===
The three overlapping stories all take place in Mexico City, but because of class division, there is severe segregation of economic classes with El Chivo squatting on the outskirts of town, Octavio living in a working-class neighborhood, and Valeria living in a luxurious high-rise apartment. If not for the car crash, these three characters would never interact. The upper class is victimized in &quot;Amores perros&quot; even when they are the ones perpetuating crime. For instance, El Chivo is hired to kill a man&#x27;s business partner and eventually decides to leave both men to fight it out themselves. Although Ramiro works at a grocery store, he also participates in the underground economy by committing robberies. Octavio and El Chivo participate in the underground economy as well, in order to secure untaxed income and bring stability to their lives.

=== Violence ===
&quot;Amores perros&quot; contains domestic violence, gun violence, and animal cruelty. The domestic violence is evident in the relationship between Ramiro and his wife, Susana, when Ramiro beats his younger brother Octavio with a metal rod while Octavio takes a shower, as well as in Valeria and Daniel&#x27;s relationship as they both begin to become verbally and physically aggressive after Valeria becomes depressed. Gun violence is seen from the beginning of the film in a frantic car chase until the very end when El Chivo hands the gun to the two business partners, leaving them to fight their own battle. Lastly, animal cruelty is quite visible in the dog fights Octavio attends in order to make money off of his dog, Cofi. The dog owners show no empathy toward their dogs.

==Production==
Produced by Zeta Film and AltaVista Films, production began on 12 April 1999.

The DVD of &quot;Amores perros&quot; has a commentary track, by the director and the screenplay writer. A controversial aspect of the film is the dog fighting sequences. González Iñárritu explains that no dogs were harmed during the making of &quot;Amores perros&quot;. In the scenes where dogs are apparently attacking each other, they were actually playing. Their muzzles were covered with fine fishing line, so that they were unable to bite another dog. In the shots where dogs are apparently dead or dying, they were sedated (under supervision of the Mexican SPCA). The grittiness of the scenes is amplified by quick cuts and sound effects. Another unusual aspect of the production of &quot;Amores perros&quot; was the danger to the cast and film crew while filming in the poor parts of Mexico City. The director and some of the crew were actually robbed by street gangs.
The Director cut includes a cameo from the veteran Japanese singer Kazuyo Togawa singing A cappella, credited as &quot;Fat Lady&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film was critically acclaimed and received many nominations and awards. Review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes reports that 92% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 118 reviews, with an average score of 7.75/10. The consensus reads &quot;The brutality of &quot;Amores Perros&quot; may be difficult to watch at times, but this intense, gritty film packs a hard wallop&quot;. On Metacritic, it has a score of 83 out of 100 based on 31 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

<text>Sir Stuart Newton Hampshire (1 October 1914 – 13 June 2004) was an English philosopher, literary critic and university administrator. He was one of the antirationalist Oxford thinkers who gave a new direction to moral and political thought in the post-World War II era.

==Biography==
Hampshire was born in Healing, Lincolnshire, the son of George Newton Hampshire, a fish merchant in nearby Grimsby. Hampshire was educated at Lockers Park School in Hertfordshire (where he overlapped with Guy Burgess), Repton School and Balliol College, Oxford, where he matriculated as a history scholar. He did not confine himself to history, switching instead to the study of Greats and immersing himself in the study of painting and literature. As was the culture at Balliol, his intellectual development owed more to his gifted contemporaries than to academic tutors. Having taken a first class degree, in 1936 he was elected to a Fellowship of All Souls College, Oxford, where he researched and taught philosophy initially as an adherent of logical positivism. He participated in an informal discussion group with some of the leading philosophers of his day, including J. L. Austin, H. L. A. Hart, and Isaiah Berlin.

In 1940, at the outbreak of World War II he enlisted in the army and was given a commission. Due to his lack of physical aptitude he was seconded to a position in military intelligence near London where he worked with Oxford colleagues such as Gilbert Ryle and Hugh Trevor-Roper. His encounters as interrogator with Nazi officers at the end of the war led to his insistence on the reality of evil.

After the war, he worked for the government before resuming his career in philosophy. From 1947 to 1950, he taught at University College London, and was subsequently a fellow of New College, Oxford. His study &quot;Spinoza&quot; was first published in 1951. In 1955, he returned to All Souls, as a resident fellow and domestic bursar.

In 1962 Hampshire was asked by the UK Treasury to conduct a review of GCHQ, covering technical, political, economic and strategic factors over the next ten years, including the relationship with the US National Security Agency through the UKUSA relationship. The &#x27;Hampshire Report&#x27; set direction and funding for GCHQ for the future and put its relationship with the NSA at the centre of its growth.

His innovative book &quot;Thought and Action&quot; (1959) attracted much attention, notably from his Oxford colleague Iris Murdoch. It propounded an &quot;intentionalist&quot; theory of the philosophy of mind taking account of developments in psychology. Although he considered most continental philosophy vulgar and fraudulent, Hampshire was much influenced by Maurice Merleau-Ponty. He insisted that philosophy of mind &quot;has been distorted by philosophers when they think of persons only as passive observers and not as self-willed agents&quot;. In his subsequent books, Hampshire sought to shift moral philosophy from its focus on the logical properties of moral statements to what he considered the crucial question of &quot;moral problems as they present themselves to us as practical agents.&quot;

In 1960, Stuart Hampshire was elected a member of the British Academy and became Grote Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic at University College London, succeeding A. J. Ayer. His international reputation was growing and from 1963 to 1970 he chaired the department of philosophy at Princeton University to which he had happily escaped from the robust atmosphere of London to which his mandarin style, conveyed in a rather preposterous growling accent, was ill-suited, as Ayer implied in his memoirs. In 1970, he returned to Oxford as Warden of Wadham College, Oxford. Wadham was in the first group of men-only Oxford colleges to admit women in 1974. Hampshire considered his wardenship to be one of his most significant achievements in reviving the fortunes of the college. He was knighted in 1979 and retired from Wadham in 1984, when he accepted a professorship at Stanford University.

His last book, &quot;Justice Is Conflict&quot; (1999), inaugurated the &quot;Princeton Monographs in Philosophy&quot; series.

Stuart Hampshire wrote extensively on literature and other topics for &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; amongst others. He was head of the literary panel of the Arts Council for many years. In 1962–63, he was selected by the UK government to conduct a review of the effectiveness of GCHQ.

He married his first wife, Renée Ayer (née Lees) he former wife of the philosopher A. J. Ayer, in 1961. They had a daughter by this marriage which ended with Renée&#x27;s death in 1980. In 1985 he married Nancy Cartwright, who was then his colleague at Stanford and is now Professor of Philosophy at Durham University and at the University of California, San Diego. The couple had two daughters.

<text>Sarit Sarak () or Sharit Sharak () is a classical Meitei traditional martial art form. It is originated from the Ancient Kangleipak (present day Manipur state). It is practised without using any weaponry. It is also defined as &quot;hand to hand combat.&quot; It is considered as the sibling of Thang Ta, which uses weapons.

Sarit-Sarak is a form of unarmed combat that includes techniques like &quot;Khutlon (hand and arm movements) and Khonglon (foot and leg movements)&quot;. These techniques help improve strength, agility, and self-defense skills without using weapons.

It is a unique style of unarmed combat that stands out from other martial arts. It is perfect in both avoiding attacks and launching its own, making it superior to other martial arts in the same category.

In ancient times, Sarit-Sarak was an important part of Meitei society, helping warriors stay strong and ready, even without weapons. It taught important skills like offense, self-defense, and planning. Sharing the lessons from Sarit-Sarak with the current generation keep these traditions alive and improve physical and mental strength.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;Sarit-Sarak&quot; is derived from two Meitei language words: &quot;Sha-lit&quot; and &quot;Sha-lak.&quot; &quot;Sha-lit&quot; refers to escaping from an animal, while &quot;Sha-lak&quot; means taming the animal. The combination of these words reflects the system’s focus on both evading attacks and controlling or neutralizing threats, similar to how one would escape from or tame a wild animal.

== Associations and organizations ==
=== National level in New Delhi ===
The Sarit-Sarak Federation of India, in collaboration with the Sarit-Sarak Association of New Delhi, organized the First National Sarit-Sarak Championship at the Akhil Bharat Hindu Maha Sabha Auditorium in 2024. The championship featured two events: &quot;Ahanba Chainaba&quot; and &quot;Anishuba Chainaba.&quot;

The competition was held with participation from 20 teams across states such as Manipur, Assam, Nagaland, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu.

=== Manipur ===
The Sarit-Sarak Association of Manipur organizes state-level trials to select teams for the Sarit-Sarak Federation Cup, an annual event held under the Sarit-Sarak Swadeshi Martial Arts Sports Association, Maharashtra. The competition typically takes place in October, with the trials held in advance to select athletes from affiliated units. The events are hosted in various locations, including venues like the Rajiv Gandhi Indoor Stadium in Solapur.
=== Jammu &amp; Kashmir ===
The J&amp;K Sarit Association took part in the first Sarit Sarak Federation Cup, held in Solapur, Maharashtra, from December 21-23 of 2024. The tournament had teams from 16 states across India. The J&amp;K team performed well, finishing in fourth place and winning 18 medals.

<doc id="729994" wikidata="Q156294" url="?curid=729994" title="Stachys">
<text>Stachys is a genus of plants, one of the largest in the mint family Lamiaceae. Estimates of the number of species vary from about 300, to about 450. &quot;Stachys&quot; is in the subfamily Lamioideae and its type species is &quot;Stachys sylvatica&quot;. The precise extent of the genus and its relationship to other genera in the subfamily are poorly known.

==Range and naming==
The distribution of the genus covers Europe, Asia, Africa, Australasia and North America. Common names include hedgenettle, heal-all, self-heal, woundwort, betony, and lamb&#x27;s ears. Wood betony, &quot;S. officinalis&quot;, was the most important medicinal herb to the Anglo-Saxons of early medieval England, and was used for many medicinal purposes from Ancient Roman times to the Early Modern period.

&quot;Stachys&quot; was named by Linnaeus in &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1753. The name is derived from the Greek word σταχυς (&quot;stachys&quot;), meaning &quot;an ear of grain&quot;, and refers to the fact that the inflorescence is often a spike. The name woundwort derives from the past use of certain species in herbal medicine for the treatment of wounds.

==Human uses==
The Chinese artichoke or Crosne (&quot;S. affinis&quot;), is grown for its edible tuber. Several species are cultivated as ornamentals. Woolly betony (&quot;S. byzantina&quot;) is a popular decorative garden plant. Wood betony (&quot;S. officinalis&quot;) was historically a highly valued medicinal plant.

==Use by other species==
&quot;Stachys&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the moths &quot;Coleophora auricella&quot;, &quot;C. lineolea&quot;, and &quot;C. wockeella&quot;, all recorded on &quot;S. officinalis&quot;. They are also widely used by the European wool carder bee (&quot;Anthidium manicatum&quot;), which scrape the hairs from the plant in order to use them for building their nests.

==Description==

&quot;Stachys&quot; is a genus of shrubs and annual or perennial herbs. The stems vary from tall, with simple, opposite, triangular leaves, long with serrate margins. In most species, the leaves are softly hairy. The flowers are long, clustered in the axils of the leaves on the upper part of the stem. The corolla is 5-lobed with the top lobe forming a &#x27;hood&#x27;, varying from white to pink, purple, red or pale yellow.

==Circumscription==
The distinction between &quot;Stachys&quot; and other genera is unclear and has varied from one author to another. In 2002, a molecular phylogenetic study showed that &quot;Stachys officinalis&quot; is not closely related to the rest of the genus. This study also found six other genera to be embedded within &quot;Stachys&quot; as it is currently circumscribed. The embedded genera are &quot;Prasium&quot;, &quot;Phlomidoschema&quot;, &quot;Sideritis&quot;, &quot;Haplostachys&quot;, &quot;Phyllostegia&quot;, and &quot;Stenogyne&quot;.

==Fossil record==
†&quot;Stachys pliocenica&quot; fossil seeds are known from Upper Miocene strata of Bulgaria and Pliocene strata of south-eastern Belarus. The fossil seeds are similar to the seeds of &quot;Stachys cretica&quot;.

<text>Earl of Wilmington was a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1730 for the politician Spencer Compton, 1st Baron Wilmington, who later served as Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1742 to 1743, during the reign of George II. He had already been created Baron Wilmington in 1728 and was made Viscount Pevensey at the same time as he was given the earldom. Compton was the third son of James Compton, 3rd Earl of Northampton. The titles became extinct on his death in 1743, as he left no male heirs.

The Wilmington title was revived in 1812 when his great-great-nephew Charles Compton, 9th Earl of Northampton, was made Baron Wilmington, Earl Compton and Marquess of Northampton.

The American settlements of Wilmington, Massachusetts, Wilmington, Delaware; Wilmington, Vermont; and Wilmington, North Carolina were named for Spencer Compton, Earl of Wilmington.

<doc id="729998" wikidata="Q204952" url="?curid=729998" title="Zinc sulfide">
<text>Zinc sulfide (or zinc sulphide) is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula of ZnS. This is the main form of zinc found in nature, where it mainly occurs as the mineral sphalerite. Although this mineral is usually black because of various impurities, the pure material is white, and it is widely used as a pigment. In its dense synthetic form, zinc sulfide can be transparent, and it is used as a window for visible optics and infrared optics.

==Structure==
ZnS exists in two main crystalline forms. This dualism is an example of polymorphism. In each form, the coordination geometry at Zn and S is tetrahedral. The more stable cubic form is known also as zinc blende or sphalerite. The hexagonal form is known as the mineral wurtzite, although it also can be produced synthetically. The transition from the sphalerite form to the wurtzite form occurs at around 1020 °C.

==Applications==

===Luminescent material===

Zinc sulfide, with addition of a few ppm of a suitable activator, exhibits strong phosphorescence. The phenomenon was described by Nikola Tesla in 1893, and is currently used in many applications, from cathode-ray tubes through X-ray screens to glow in the dark products. When silver is used as activator, the resulting color is bright blue, with maximum at 450 nanometers. Using manganese yields an orange-red color at around 590 nanometers. Copper gives a longer glow, and it has the familiar greenish glow-in-the-dark. Copper-doped zinc sulfide (&quot;ZnS plus Cu&quot;) is used also in electroluminescent panels. It also exhibits phosphorescence due to impurities on illumination with blue or ultraviolet light.

===Optical material===
Zinc sulfide is also used as an infrared optical material, transmitting from visible wavelengths to just over 12 micrometers. It can be used planar as an optical window or shaped into a lens. It is made as microcrystalline sheets by the synthesis from hydrogen sulfide gas and zinc vapour, and this is sold as FLIR-grade (Forward Looking Infrared), where the zinc sulfide is in a milky-yellow, opaque form. This material when hot isostatically pressed (HIPed) can be converted to a water-clear form known as Cleartran (trademark). Early commercial forms were marketed as Irtran-2 but this designation is now obsolete.

===Pigment===
Zinc sulfide is a common pigment, sometimes called sachtolith. When combined with barium sulfate, zinc sulfide forms lithopone.

===Catalyst===
Fine ZnS powder is an efficient photocatalyst, which produces hydrogen gas from water upon illumination. Sulfur vacancies can be introduced in ZnS during its synthesis; this gradually turns the white-yellowish ZnS into a brown powder, and boosts the photocatalytic activity through enhanced light absorption.

===Semiconductor properties===
Both sphalerite and wurtzite are intrinsic, wide-bandgap semiconductors. These are prototypical II-VI semiconductors, and they adopt structures related to many of the other semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide. The cubic form of ZnS has a band gap of about 3.54 electron volts at 300 kelvins, but the hexagonal form has a band gap of about 3.91 electron volts. ZnS can be doped as either an n-type semiconductor or a p-type semiconductor.

==History==
The phosphorescence of ZnS was first reported by the French chemist Théodore Sidot in 1866. His findings were presented by A. E. Becquerel, who was renowned for the research on luminescence. ZnS was used by Ernest Rutherford and others in the early years of nuclear physics as a scintillation detector, because it emits light upon excitation by x-rays or electron beam, making it useful for X-ray screens and cathode-ray tubes. This property made zinc sulfide useful in the dials of radium watches.

==Production==
Zinc sulfide is usually produced from waste materials from other applications. Typical sources include smelter, slag, and pickle liquors. As an example, the synthesis of ammonia from methane requires &quot;a priori&quot; removal of hydrogen sulfide impurities in the natural gas, for which zinc oxide is used. This scavenging produces zinc sulfide:
:ZnO + H2S → ZnS + H2O

===Laboratory preparation===
Crude zinc sulfide can be produced by igniting a mixture of zinc and sulfur. More conventionally, ZnS is prepared by treating a mildly acidic solution of Zn2+ salts with H2S:
:Zn2+ + S2− → ZnS
This reaction is the basis of a gravimetric analysis for zinc.

<doc id="730011" wikidata="Q256001" url="?curid=730011" title="Heidi Hautala">
<text>Heidi Anneli Hautala (born 14 November 1955) is a Finnish politician and Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from Finland. She is a member of the Green League, part of the European Green Party.

She is currently a Member of the European Parliament for the fifth time. Previously she held the post from 1995 to 2003 and 2009 to 2011 when she chaired the Subcommittee on Human Rights 2009–2011. She has been the Vice-President of the European Parliament since 2017. She served as minister for international development and ownership steering issues in Jyrki Katainen&#x27;s cabinet.

==Early life and education==
Hautala was born in the northern Finnish city of Oulu in 1955. Her father was a high-ranking war-hero who later went on to become one of the region’s most powerful bankers.

Hautala holds a master&#x27;s degree in horticulture. She speaks Finnish, English, Swedish, German, French and some Russian.

==Political career==

===Beginnings in national politics===
Hautala was the leader of the Finnish Green Party from 1987 to 1991, and a presidential candidate in 2000 and 2006. She was a member of the national parliament from 1991 to 1995.

===Member of the European Parliament, 1995–2003===
After Finland joined the European Union (EU) in 1995, Hautala was elected to the European Parliament. Between 1998 and 1999, she served as chair of the Committee on Women&#x27;s Rights. She later led the Greens–European Free Alliance in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2002, alongside Paul Lannoye.

After less than two years on the assembly’s influential environment committee, Hautala was chosen to steer a highly sensitive proposal for a Fuel Quality Directive through the parliament.

As a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs between 1999 and 2003, Hautala participated in the negotiations to increase openness in the EU. In 2001, she successfully took the Council of the European Union to the European Court of Justice over access to a document on arms export rules. The Court ruled that the ministers should have considered publishing at least part of the document. The so-called &quot;Hautala case&quot; set a precedent in European law for access to documents. In 2002, Hautala led a campaign for the European Parliament to set up a public register of members’ assistants.

Between 2002 and 2003, Hautala was the president of the European Parliament Intergroup on Public Health.

===Member of the Finnish Parliament, 2003–2009===
Hautala returned to the national Parliament in the elections of 2003.

Hautala was the chair of the Administrative Council of Neste Oil, a Finnish oil refining and marketing company producing mainly transportation fuels and other refined petroleum products. She works closely with EU affairs as a member of the Grand Committee. In addition, she chaired the Green parliamentary group and was the Chair of the Legal Affairs Committee in the Finnish Parliament. Also she was a member of the Parliament&#x27;s Speaker&#x27;s Council, as well as the chair of the National Equality Commission (TANE). She advocates environmental responsibility, openness in politics, and global justice. 

In the first round of the 2006 election, Hautala finished fourth of the eight candidates with a vote share of 3.5% (105,248 votes).

===Member of the European Parliament, 2009–2011===
In 2009, Hautala was re-elected to the European Parliament, where she served as chair of the Subcommittee on Human Rights and as member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.

Hautal became well-known for promoting transparency in the EU after winning the case against the Council on access to documents on arm trade, known as the Hautala Case T-14/98.

Hautala is a signatory of the 2010 Declaration on Crimes of Communism, a patron of its preceding conference, and was a member of the Reconciliation of European Histories Group as an MEP.

===Minister of international development and state ownership steering 2011-2013===
Hautala was nominated the minister of international development and state ownership to Jyrki Katainen&#x27;s government in 2011. In 2013 it emerged Hautala had hired cleaning lady and repair work without taking care of the employer payments. She agreed to pay the contributions and apologised for her actions, and resigned from the ministerial working group against the informal economy.
Later, she promoted the service Palkkaus.fi service that was inspired by her: the service intends to make it easy for private employers to handle all the employer payments through a website.

====Arctic Shipping case and resignation====
Hautala resigned from her development and state ownership steering minister position in October 2013 amidst of allegations of abuse of power.

In a protest against Arctic ice drilling a year earlier, members of Greenpeace boarded without authorization on the multipurpose icebreakers &quot;Fennica&quot; and &quot;Nordica&quot; operated by the state-owned company Arctia Shipping under contract to the Royal Dutch Shell. Hautala&#x27;s office had recommended that the company withdraw its criminal complaint against Greenpeace, and threatened to fire the management in case that they disobliged. When &quot;Iltalehti&quot; first broke the story, Hautala initially offered a different account of the events, denying that her office had pressured the company.
She eventually stated that she could no longer work as a minister, because she had been inaccurate and remembered things incorrectly.

Hautala had also made comments in an open support of Greenpeace activists detained in Russia under piracy charges, criticising Russia of &quot;disproportionately tough measures&quot; against the members of the NGO.

In February 2014 the Chancellor of Justice Jaakko Jonkka stated, that neither Hautala nor the head of the state ownership steering unit of the government acted unlawfully when preventing the filing criminal charges a case against Greenpeace.

Later, former activists of the Finnish Seafarers&#x27; Union admitted they started the Arctia Shipping case with the help of Finns Party&#x27;s Matti Putkonen. Hautala considered having been a target of the union activists because of lay offs due to sectoral reforms.

===Member of the European Parliament, 2014–2019===
Hautala returned to the European Parliament following the 2014 elections. She has since been a member of the Committee on Development, Committee on Legal Affairs and Committee on International Trade as well as substitute member of the Committee on Budgets. She also served as vice-chair of the Greens–European Free Alliance, under the leadership of Rebecca Harms and Philippe Lamberts from 1 July 2014 to 14 November 2017. She was also a co-president of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly, and the chair of European Parliament delegation to the Euronest from 4 September 2014 to 1 February 2017.

In addition to her committee assignment, Hautala served as co-chair of the Working group on Reproductive Health, HIV/AIDS, and Development in the European Parliament. She was also a member of the European Parliament Intergroup on Western Sahara, several international delegations and the European Parliament Intergroup on the Welfare and Conservation of Animals.

In 2016, Hautala was appointed by Erik Solheim, the Chairman of the Development Assistance Committee, to serve on the High Level Panel on the Future of the Development Assistance Committee under the leadership of Mary Robinson.
On development, Hautala has proposed that sexual and reproductive health and rights and a gender action plan be core elements of the development policy in light of the Sustainable Development Goals.
She has opposed using development policy mechanisms as a basis for military intervention under EU umbrella, denouncing a weak legal basis for the move.

On trade, Hautala has proposed to curb the global trade of illegal timber to prevent deforestation, asked the European Commission to introduce legislation to establish human rights due diligence requirements for multinational EU companies to respect human rights and prevent incidents such as Rana Plaza. and presented a shadow EU Action Plan on Responsible Business Conduct, to increase business accountability and responsibility, avoid that globalisation produce a race to the bottom and stop supply chains which deliver profits from human rights violations, such as an estimated $150 billion a year from forced labour.

In October 2017, Hautala was appointed as the Vice President of the European Parliament until summer 2019, becoming the third Finn to hold the position. In this capacity, she was also a member of the Democracy Support and Election Coordination Group (DEG), which oversees the Parliament’s election observation missions.

Results of her parliamentary activity include several reports of which she was in charge as rapporteur and which have been approved by a very large majority, including:
* a regulation to establish a fund of over 300 M€, within the 2021-27 budget of the European Union, for &quot;the further development of a European area of justice based on the rule of law, including independence and impartiality of the judiciary, on mutual recognition, mutual trust and judicial cooperation, thereby also strengthening democracy rule of law and fundamental rights&quot;;
* a non-legislative resolution recommending that any trade agreement with Vietnam avoid encouraging environmental damage such as deforestation (connected to the export of illegal timber from illegal logging);
* a resolution on the management of forests in developing countries containing a number of recommendations on Forest and land governance, Responsible supply chains and financing, Policy coherence for development, Forest criminality, trade issues;
* the 2014 report on monitoring the application of EU law;
* several reports on cases of requested parliamentary immunity and on the accession of states to the Child Abduction Convention.

In March 2019, Hautala won another lawsuit for transparency, case T-329/17 Hautala and others v EFSA: the General Court annulled «the decision of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) of 14 March 2017, in so far as EFSA refused access to the parts &quot;material, experimental conditions and methods&quot; and &quot;results and discussion&quot; of 12 carcinogenicity studies on the active substance glyphosate». The lawsuit was filed in 2017, following a long controversy around the glyphosate re-authorisation process and the so-called Monsanto Papers, after which EFSA refused to release a number of documents including 75 unpublished studies because «disclosure of the other parts of the studies could undermine the commercial interests of their owners». The court established «that the protection of those commercial interests may not be invoked to preclude the disclosure of that information» by EU institutions, as the public interest prevails.

For the then upcoming Finnish semester, Hautala in 2019 proposed the promotion of health and well-being as an overall objective under which to work on matters such as global warming, air pollution and energy efficiency of buildings.

Hautala was ranked as one of the 15 most influential MEPs in the 2014-19 legislature by VoteWatch, as measured by the positions held, the number of reports and opinions and the votes won, weighed by perceived importance and normalized by average influence of their country.

Hautala has a son from her relationship with a Finnish artist J. O. Mallander.

<text>Rosa gigantea is a species of rose native to northeast India, northern Myanmar and southwest China (Yunnan) in the foothills of the Himalaya at 1000–1500 m altitude. It is sometimes considered to be a variety of &quot;Rosa odorata&quot;, as &quot;R. odorata&quot; var. &quot;gigantea&quot;.

As its name suggests, it is the largest species of rose, climbing 20 m or more into the crowns of other trees by means of its stout, hooked thorns, and with a trunk up to 50 cm diameter. The leaves are semi-evergreen, 15–25 cm long, pinnate, with usually 7 leaflets, each leaflet 4–8 cm long. The flowers are white, creamy or yellow, the largest of any wild rose, 10–14 cm diameter. The hips are yellow or orange, 2.5–3.5 cm diameter, hard, and often lasting through the winter into the following spring, often still present at the same time as the next years&#x27; flowers.

Another rose, described from Manipur in 1888 as &quot;R. macrocarpa&quot; and &quot;R. xanthocarpa&quot; by Sir George Watt, an authority on Indian roses, is now generally considered to be the same species as &quot;R. gigantea&quot;. The distinct characteristics claimed for &quot;R. macrocarpa&quot; (deeper yellow flowers, larger foliage with 4 to 7 leaflets and large yellow fruits) are not consistent.

After gene sequencing was carried out in 2018, it was found that &quot;Rosa roxburghii&quot; is closely related to &quot;Rosa odorata var. gigantea&quot;.

<text>Eld&#x27;s deer (Rucervus eldii or Panolia eldii), also known as the thamin or brow-antlered deer, is an Endangered species of deer endemic to South and Southeast Asia. It inhabits wetlands and marshlands. It is active during the day and mates from October to the end of December. Three subspecies are recognised. All three are threatened by hunting and deforestation.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described by John McClelland in 1840 based on specimens obtained in Manipur, India. It was described more detailed by Percy Eld in 1841; it was suggested to call the deer &quot;Cervus Eldii&quot;. McClelland coined the scientific name &quot;Cervus (Rusa) frontals&quot; in 1843.
In 1850, John Edward Gray proposed the name &quot;Panolia eldii&quot; for the deer. It has recently been proposed that it should be moved back to the genus &quot;Panolia&quot; on the basis of recent genetic findings that place it closer to Pere David&#x27;s deer than to other members of the genus &quot;Rucervus&quot;.

The three subspecies of the Eld&#x27;s deer are:
*&quot;R. e. eldii&quot;: Nominate subspecies. The Manipuri brow-antlered deer is found in Manipur, India. It is called the &quot;sangai&quot; in Meitei.
*&quot;R. e. thamin&quot;: The Burmese brow-antlered deer found in Myanmar and westernmost Thailand.
*&quot;R. e. siamensis&quot;: The Thai brow-antlered deer is found in Cambodia, China, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam, and may be treated as a separate species. The population on the Chinese island of Hainan is sometimes considered another subspecies, &quot;P. e. hainanus&quot;, but this is not supported by genetic evidence. It was described by Lydekker in 1915.

==Appearance==
The following measurements have been reported for the Eld&#x27;s deer:

* Head–body length: 
* Shoulder height: 
* Tail length: 
* Weight: 
* Antler length: 

The deer are generally of medium size and are similar to the size and shape of the related barasingha (&quot;R. duvaucelli&quot;). The species has a very regal and graceful &quot;Cervus&quot;-like physique. Its legs are thin and long and have a long body with a large head on a thin neck. The throat of a male has a thick mane of long hair. Males (stags) are taller and heavier than females (hinds or does). Their coats, rough and coarse, change colour with the season; in summer the colour is reddish-brown, while in winter, it turns dark brown, with males tending to be darker than the females. The tail is short in length and the rump has no distinct patch. Despite these features, they have actually related to the Père David&#x27;s deer. The antlers, bow- or lyre-shaped, do not grow upwards, but tend to grow outwards and then inwards; a smaller branch grows towards the front of the head. The brow tines are especially long and noticeable. The brow-antlered deer is so named because they have long brow tines. The antlers of Eld&#x27;s deer are structurally different from those of barasingha but have similarities to those of Père David&#x27;s deer, consistent with the genetic relationship. They shed their antlers every year, with the largest size attained during the breeding season.

==Conservation status==
The conservation status of three subspecies of Eld&#x27;s deer, by country, are:
===India===
The Keibul Lamjao National Park (KLNP), covering an area of of marshland called the Phumdis within the larger Loktak Lake, was gazetted in 1977 specifically to protect the &quot;Rucervus eldii eldii&quot;, the &quot;sangai&quot; in Meitei. Over time, public awareness and local support have evolved for conserving the subspecies of the endemic endangered Elds&#x27; deer. Concerted actions have been initiated to stop the encroachment of the park and adequate security arrangements have been made to stop poaching. This fact is very somberly presented in a story form in a popular children&#x27;s magazine called &quot;Chandamama&quot;, which gives a first-person symbolic narrative by the affected &#x27;deer&#x27; itself. The final conclusion by the deer, quoted below, concisely puts the security provided in the park in a proper perspective.
&quot; &#x27;Thanks to these youngsters who live nearby&#x27;, he said. I was happy and felt indebted to the youngsters for saving our lives. My friend added that these people really loved and respected the Sangai deer. They believed that killing the Sangai was an unpardonable sin. According to a Meitei legend, the Sangai are the link between humans and nature. So, killing us would mean breaking a bond. My friend informed me that people concerned about animals like us have formed a group. They teach others to protect animals, too.&lt;br&gt;
The news that people are trying their best to save the phumdis, deer like me, and the Loktak Lake, infuse new hope in me. &#x27;How nice of them!&#x27; I thought.&lt;br&gt;
Anyway, it is getting dark and my friend and I have to return to our herd. And those of you who are around can enjoy our dancing gait as we trot back home. It would be great if I could meet you again. We could dance together at KLNP, if you can make it here some time!&quot;

The home range of brow-antlered deer in the park is confined to in the southwestern part of the lake where phumdis on which the deer thrive are abundant. A study conducted on the proportion, on the basis of body weight of stag, hind and fawn, is reported to be 4:2:1. The &quot;sangai&quot; distribution dictated by shelter and availability of food is high near Toyaching, Pabotching and the Yang Kokchambi area.

Censuses conducted by the wildlife wing of the Forest Department in 1975, 1990, 2000, and 2003 have shown the Eld&#x27;s deer population was 14, 76, 162 and 180, respectively. The 2000 survey of 162 deer included 54 stags, 76 hinds and 32 fawns. The reports of 2004 indicate a figure of 182 as referred in another section here, which shows the subspecies in Manipur is on the rise.

A successful captive breeding programme is underway at the Alipore Zoological Gardens in Kolkata, and many specimens of the deer have been bred here.

===Myanmar===
For the protection of the thiamin subspecies of the Eld&#x27;s deer, Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary and Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary (both protected sanctuaries) and Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park were chosen. Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary, with an area of in Myanmar&#x27;s central plains, northwest of the city of Mandalay, has Indaing deciduous broadleaf forest dominated by &quot;Dipterocarpus tuberculatus&quot; and is the habitat for four species of deer: thamin, muntjac (&quot;Muntiacus muntjac&quot;), hog deer (&quot;Axis porcinus&quot;), and &quot;sambhar&quot; (&quot;Rusa unicolor&quot;). Subject to indiscriminate hunting in the past (till the ownership of guns was controlled after the 1960s), the thamin, highly threatened, now has a population of about 1,000. Initially, the Smithsonian National Zoo acquired a few thamin for observations and subsequently shifted a few to its Conservation and Research Center at Front Royal, Virginia for biological study.
For a cross–check of the biological studies done at the research center, the Smithsonian Institution selected the Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary, a protected park. Special studies on the thamin deer were conducted by the conservation scientists headed by Christen Wemmer of the Smithsonian. They gathered details on the biology and survival of the species by duly correlating with the changes that occurred in the ecology of the region of the Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary. Under the research project study, the ecology of thamin and a series of training courses in biodiversity were organised. The thamin&#x27;s life cycle studies on 11 male and eight female radio–collared deer, supported by field studies by the scientists, revealed:

# Its life cycle was well-tuned to the seasonal rhythm of its environment.
# An average group size was 2.5 per ; deer mother with young appeared to be the basic social unit.
# Males were in velvet when they were in bachelor groups.
# After new grass sprouts in the ashes of February and March fires, they gathered to graze on tender shoots.
# Males moved through the herds seeking receptive females.
# March and April were the months of rut.
# Males with their newly hardened antlers were in a state of anorexia and sexual obsession during this period.
# They operated in a specific home range of about to .
# When food was short, some animals migrated into farmland for a few months before returning to the park; during the day they hid in small patches of degraded forest and at night they forayed into the croplands.

Smithsonian National Zoological Park, which has been closely associated with the preservation of the thamin deer, has in its conclusive observations stated: &quot;Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary (CWS) in Myanmar (Burma) protects the largest population of the endangered Eld&#x27;s deer left in the world. It also represents one of the largest remaining patches of dipterocarp forest–a dry forest that is one of the most threatened and least protected forest types globally. Local people rely on these forests for their livelihood. The forests provide wood, food, , and medicine. Restricting people&#x27;s access to these forests by declaring them protected is probably not a sustainable solution and will put greater burden on lower income households potentially increasing poverty. However, if people continue to use and abuse forests unregulated they will disappear and with them the Eld&#x27;s deer and many other species.&quot; 

With external funding for such protection drying up, though, the efforts had not yielded encouraging results and the conclusion was the conditions were not conducive even to protect the protected parks given the political and funding situation in the country.

The picture is not encouraging in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, either. The Burmese brow-antlered deer is &#x27;Near Threatened&#x27; and still occurs in reasonable numbers.

===Thailand===
The situation of protected areas for the Eld&#x27;s deer is much worse in Thailand and along its border areas with Laos and Cambodia; it is feared that it may be difficult to prevent the &quot;decline and likely extirpation of Eld&#x27;s deer from the wild in Thailand&quot;.

===Other countries===
In Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, Eld&#x27;s deer was hunted for the traditional medicinal trade (particularly of this subspecies) and to meet demand for captive animals (especially from zoos) and forest habitat was degraded (deforested) to meet agriculture and infrastructural developments. The subpopulation in Hainan considered as a subspecies by Chinese conservationists was almost extinct in the wild.

In the Savannakhet Province of Laos, conservation efforts centred around community management caused the local population to increase from 80 to 170. A 130,000 hectare National Eld&#x27;s Deer Sanctuary was created in the area.

==Assessment==
In over 200 recent years of known history, the number of this species has declined substantially. Based on estimated rates of the decline of this species assessed in three generations (supposed to be at least a 15-year period) for all the species, the average value is reported to be in excess of 50%. Based on this assessment, IUCN has categorised the species as Endangered. In this assessment for determining the species-level, the numbers in India were considered to be numerically small (also found to be increasing), hence the numbers of wild populations only of Eld&#x27;s deer &quot;P. e. thamin&quot; in Myanmar and &quot;P. e. siamensis&quot; of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam were considered. The decline in population has been mainly attributed to hunting. In the case of the Myanmar thamin, the decline is discernible but not striking. The categorization is considered a middle-ground situation considering the extensively diverse conditions and conservation trends in the geographically isolated and distinct populations of this species.

==Subspecies==
===Breeding===
Female Eld&#x27;s deer are generally found alone or in pairs with their young, but during the mating season, females and their young gather in herds of up to 50 individuals. Males also move around singly except during mating season. When rutting takes place, males compete with each other to gain control of a harem of females with which they can then mate. After a long gestation period, normally a single calf is born. The young have white spots at birth which fade away as they grow; they are weaned at seven months of age, and become sexually mature from 18 months of age onwards. The gestation period for three species is 220 to 240 days, with birthing occurring:.

* For Manipur deer, between October and end of December
* For the Burmese thamin, between October and November
* For the siamensis deer in Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia, between October and November


===Numbers in the wild===
In India, the Eld&#x27;s deer sangai subspecies is confined to the peculiar floating bog called Phumdis in Loktak Lake and is numbered at less than a few hundred animals. The subspecies &quot;P. e. siamensis&quot;, which occupied the vast monsoon forests from Thailand to Hainan was extinct in Thailand, very few in number in Laos and Cambodia, and almost extinct in Vietnam. A few hundred deer were protected in a large enclosure in Hainan Island, China. The estimated figures are:

* 180 animals (2004) of &quot;P. e. eldii&quot; in Manipur, India
* 2,200 (United Nations estimate) – 1992 survey for &quot;P. e. thamin&quot; of Burma and Thailand
* In low tens (2004)– for &quot;P. e. siamensis&quot;, considered as possibly extirpated in Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam

===Numbers in captivity (zoos)===
In 2003, the estimated number of captive animals of the three subspecies in zoos were 180 &quot;P. e. eldii&quot;, 1100 &quot;P. e. thamin&quot; and 23 &quot;P. e. siamensis&quot;.

==Ecology==
Habitats of each subspecies include:

* &quot;R. e. eldii&quot; of Manipur, India is associated with wetlands. It has adaptations of the hooves (feet) to move easily in their marshland (boggy ground) habitat of phumdis. It lives in significantly different ecosystems compared to other subspecies and in divergent morphology. Antlers are shed every year and reach their largest size during the breeding season.
* &quot;R. e. thamin&quot; of Burma and Thailand are not associated with wetlands and live in three forest types: indaing forest (dominated by the tree &quot;Dipterocarpus tuberculatus&quot;) equivalent to deciduous dipterocarp forest (dipterocarp trees which belong to the family Dipterocarpaceae are resinous trees found in the Old World tropics) of Indochina and Thailand, deciduous forests of dry (thandahat), and mixed (teak).
* &quot;R. e. siamensis&quot; of Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam are not associated with wetlands. They are found in deciduous dipterocarp forests.

==Behavior==
Some observations on the habits of Eld&#x27;s deer common to all three subspecies are:

* active most of the time; they seek shelter from the midday sun and migrate for short periods seeking water in the dry season and food in the growing season
* seek areas that are seasonally burned in search of new grasses that grow after the burn
* their diets comprise a variety of grasses, herbaceous plants, and shoots, grasses, fruit and wetland plants and they poach into cultivated crops to graze and browse in nearby fields of rice, lentils, maize, peas and grapes.

==Threats==
Thamin are prized as game by hunters due to their impressive antlers and hides that are in demand in local markets. They are also widely hunted for food; they were believed to have been used to feed armies during many Asian wars. Their population has additionally declined due to intense development activities necessitating reclamation of land for grazing, cultivation and fish farming within their range. In Myanmar, deforestation of the diperocarp forests is cited as a reason for the threat faced by the thamin deer. The habitat available for their protection is very limited; only 1% of the protected forests are suitable for its protection in South Asia. Even in protected areas, the animals are poached. Another striking problem is finding adequate funds and political will to protect the species. The species have a fragmented distribution and are therefore at risk from inbreeding and loss of genetic variation. The film &quot;The Return of Sangai&quot; is a documentary by George Thengummoottil about the species in Keibul Lamjao National Park.

== Hindu prayers ==
* Prayer or worship is considered to be an integral part of the Hindu religion. The chanting of mantras is the most popular form of worship in Hinduism. Yoga and meditation are also considered as a form of devotional service. The Om sign is a sacred sound and a spiritual symbol in Hinduism.

The Vedas are a collection of liturgy (mantras, hymns). Stuti is a general term for devotional literary compositions, but literally means praise.

The Hindu devotional Bhakti movements emphasizes repetitive prayer. Stemming from the universal Soul, or Brahman, prayer is focused on the personal forms of Devas/Devis, such as Vishnu, Vishnu&#x27;s Avatars, Rama &amp; Krishna, Shiva as well as Shakti, or Shakti&#x27;s forms such as Lakshmi or Kali. Ganesha is also a popular deity in Bhakti.

Before the process of ritual involving the invoking of various deities for the fulfillment of needs (great/small, varying in urgency), came the human aspiration for the highest truth. The foundational monism of Hinduism pertains to the one Brahman. Brahman, which summarily can be called the unknowable, true, infinite and blissful Divine Ground, is the source &amp; being of all existence from which the Cosmos spring. This is the essence of the Vedic system. The following prayer was part &amp; parcel of all Vedic ceremonies, continuing to be invoked in Hindu temples presently throughout India and the World.

== Jain prayers ==

* Bhaktamara Stotra
* Uvasagharam Stotra

*Ne&#x27;ila
*Berakhah (Jewish blessings) According to Jewish tradition, religious Jews are required to recite 100 berakhot (blessings) each day.

<doc id="730058" wikidata="Q277480" url="?curid=730058" title="Mahé, India">
<text>Mahé (), also known as Mayyazhi (), is a small town and municipality in the Mahe district of the Puducherry Union Territory. It is situated at the mouth of the Mahe River and is surrounded by the State of Kerala. The district of Kannur surrounds Mahe on three sides and Kozhikode district from one side.

Formerly part of French India, Mahe now forms a municipality in Mahe district, one of the four districts of the Union Territory of Puducherry. Mahe has one representative in the Puducherry Legislative Assembly.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Mahe&quot; derives from &quot;Mayyazhi&quot;, the name given to the local river and region in the Malayalam language. The original spelling found on French documents from the early 1720s is &quot;Mayé&quot;, with &quot;Mahe&quot; and &quot;Mahie&quot; also found on documents, maps and geographical dictionaries until the early 19th century when the spelling &quot;Mahe&quot; became the norm. Therefore, the belief that the name of the town was given in honour of Bertrand Francois Mahe de La Bourdonnais (1699–1753), whose later fame derived in good part from his association with India, including his capture of Maye in 1741, is incorrect.

Another claim that the spelling &quot;Mahe&quot; was officially adopted by the leader of the expedition that retook the city in 1726 in recognition of La Bourdonnais&#x27; role at the time is also unlikely. It is probable that the resemblance of Maye not to mention Mahe, with La Bourdonnais&#x27; family name prompted later generations to assume that the famous Frenchman was somehow directly or indirectly associated with the name to the town or the spelling of the name.

==History==

Before the arrival of European trading companies to the Indian subcontinent, this area was part of Kolathu Nadu which comprised Tulu Nadu, Chirakkal and Kadathanadu. The French East India Company constructed a fort on the site of Mahe in 1724, in accordance with an accord concluded between André Mollandin and Raja Vazhunnavar of Vatakara three years earlier. In 1741, Mahe de La Bourdonnais retook the town after a short period of occupation by the Marathas.

In 1761, the British captured Mahe and the settlement was handed over to the Rajah of Kadathanadu. The British restored Mahe to the French as a part of the 1763 Treaty of Paris. In 1779, the Anglo-French war broke out, resulting in the French loss of Mahe. In 1783, the British agreed to restore to the French their settlements in India, and Mahe was handed over to the French in 1785.


On the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793, a British force under James Hartley captured Mahe. In 1816, the British restored Mahe to the French as a part of the 1814 Treaty of Paris, after the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars. Mayyazhi remained under French jurisdiction as a small French colony, an enclave within British India, during the long span that began in 1816. After the independence of India the area continued to be French-ruled until 13 June 1954, when a long anti-colonial struggle culminated in its joining the Indian Union.

After the French left, Mahe became a district of Puducherry Union Territory. The area of Mahe begins from Mayyazhi Puzha in the north to Azhiyoor at the south. Mahe consists of Mahe town and Naluthara, which includes four villages: Pandakkal, Pallur, Chalakara and Chembra. The ruler of Kingdom of Mysore from the 1760s, Hyder Ali (ca 1722–1782), gifted Naluthara to the French as a token of appreciation for the assistance they provided in the war.

===Liberation of Mahe===
Gandhians like I. K. Kumaran led the struggle for union with India in Mahe after Indian independence in 1947. The municipal office of the French administration was attacked on 21 October 1948 at 9:00 PM. The French national flag was removed and the Indian national flag hoisted on the municipal building (&quot;Mairie&quot; in French). On 26 October, a French navy ship anchored in Mahe and the French regained control of Mahe. The ship left Mahe on 31 October. Communists tried to capture Cherukallayi enclave in April 1954. Two Indians were killed during the struggle. The Indian flag was hoisted in the Naluthura enclave on 1 May. The freedom fighters conducted an embargo on Mahe from June that year. On 14 July 1954, the Mahajanasabha organized a march into Mahe, which was liberated on 16 July 1954.

<doc id="730063" wikidata="Q2995601" url="?curid=730063" title="Loktak Lake">
<text>Loktak Lake () is a freshwater lake in Northeast India. It is a pulsating lake, with a surface area varying from 250 km2 to 500 km2 during the rainy season with a typical area of 287 km2. The lake is located at Moirang in Manipur state, India. The etymology of &quot;Loktak&quot; is &quot;Lok&quot; = &quot;stream&quot; and &quot;tak&quot; = &quot;the end&quot; in Meitei language (Manipuri language). It is famous for the phumdi (heterogeneous mass of vegetation, soil and organic matter at various stages of decomposition) floating over it. The largest of all the phumdis covers an area of and is situated on the southeastern shore of the lake. Located on this phumdi, Keibul Lamjao National Park is the only floating national park in the world. The park is the last natural refuge of the endangered Sangai (state animal), &quot;Rucervus eldii eldii&quot; or Manipur brow-antlered deer (&quot;Cervus eldi eldi&quot;), one of three subspecies of Eld&#x27;s deer.

The Loktak Day is observed every year on the 15th of October at the periphery of the Loktak lake.

This ancient lake plays an important role in the economy of Manipur. It serves as a source of water for hydropower generation, irrigation and drinking water supply. The lake is also a source of livelihood for the rural fishermen who live in the surrounding areas and on phumdis, also known as &quot;phumshangs&quot;. Human activities have led to severe pressure on the lake ecosystem. 55 rural and urban hamlets around the lake have a population of about 100,000 people.
Considering the ecological status and its biodiversity values, the lake was initially designated as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention on 23 March 1990. It was also listed under the &quot;Montreux Record&quot; on 16 June 1993, &quot;a record of Ramsar sites where changes in ecological character have occurred, are occurring or are likely to occur&quot;.

==Geography==
===Topography ===
Of the two river systems, which drain the Manipur state—the Barak River and the Manipur River—the Manipur River flows through the Manipur Valley. The river rises in the north at Karong, flows south of Imphal and hence is also known as the Imphal River. Along its course through the valley downstream of Imphal, the bed slope of the river is gentle. The drainage pattern is sub-, sub-parallel and sub-radial, dictated by the structure and lithology of the area. Imphal, Iril and Thoubal River valleys also exhibit a meandering river course.

At the Ithai barrage outlet of the Lake, the direct catchment area draining into the lake is out of which is under paddy cultivation, under habitation and under forest cover. The area of the lake is , comprising large pockets of open water and marshy land formed at the southern part of the Imphal valley up to the confluence of Manipur River and Khuga River in the district of Imphal West. The Lake is divided into two zones, namely, the &quot;Core Zone&quot; which is the no-development zone or totally protected zone comprising and the balance area is called the &quot;Buffer Zone&quot;.
Within the lake and on its periphery, there are 14 hills of varying size and elevation; in the southern part of the lake are the Sendra, Ithing and Thanga islands.

====Lake zonation====
Geographically, in terms of biodiversity and pressure of human activities, the lake is broadly divided into northern, central and southern zones as elaborated below.

The Northern Zone, extending from eastern side of Nambol River near Ngaikhong Khunou to Phabakchao including Maibam Phumlak, has five main streams/rivers namely the Manipur river, Nambul, Yangoi river, Nambol river and Thongjaorok flowing into the lake. The zone is separated from the central zone by large phumdis (varying thickness of ) that stretches from the northwest to the southeast. During January to March, phumdis in this area are usually burnt for construction of fish cum paddy farms; many large fish farms with raised levees have been built. 

The Central Zone, extending from Awang Laisoi pat (western side of Nambol River near Ngaikhong Khullen) to Laphu pat (between Khordak channel and Imphal River) encloses prominent islands of Thanga, Karang and Ithing. It has some sub zone viz Laisoi, Awangsoi, Yennapat, Tharopat etc. It is the main open water zone of the lake, which was relatively free from phumdis in the past, but over the years &#x27;athaphums&#x27; (artificially created phumdis for fishing) constructed by villagers for fishing have proliferated choking the entire lake. The State Fisheries Department has established a fisheries centre within this zone at Takmu pat for fisheries development

The Southern Zone encompasses the Keibul Lamjao National Park, Ungamel and Kumbi pats at the southern part of the lake and the zone is linked with Khuga River by the Ungamel channel. The Imphal River is also linked with this zone by the Khordak channel. The western catchment drained by the Kangshoibi River flows into this zone. Proliferation of phumdis has been observed near the mouth of Ungamel channel, Kumbi pat, Nongmaikhong and Khordak area.

===Geology===
Cretaceous limestone, the Disang with serpentinites (Lower to Middle Eocene–Upper Cretaceous), the Surmas and the Tipams (Miocene) are the dominant rock formations in the catchment of the Manipur basin. Higher reaches of hills have the Disang and Tipam groups of rocks while Surma group occurs in the lower reaches. Grey sandstone–grit–conglomerate–limestone sequences intruded by serpentinites containing minor amounts of enstalite, chromite, amphiboles and magnetite constitute the Disang formation. Argillaceous and arneceous sequence represents the Surma and Tipam groups, respectively.

===Climate===
With an average annual rainfall of tropical monsoon climate prevails in the valley. Temperatures range from . February and March are the driest months.

===Hydrology===
The Loktak Lake is fed by the Manipur river and several tributaries and ‘Ungamel Channel’ (Ithai Barrage) is its only outlet now. The origin of the Manipur river system and its tributaries, which flows in a north-south direction and drains into the lake is from the hill ranges immediately to the west of the lake. The five major rivers with indirect catchment area of are the Imphal (also called the Manipur River), the Iril, the Thoubal, the Sekmai and the Khuga. The other major streams which drain into the lake and which bring in lot of silt are the Nambul, the Nambol, the Thongjarok, the Awang Khujairok, the Awang Kharok, the Ningthoukhong, the Potsangbam, the Oinam, the Keinou and the Irulok. The Lake, located on the southern side of the Manipur river basin, is at the lowest elevation in the valley and no other major river flows into the lake, except a few rivulets.

Though hydrological data on river basin has not been adequately monitored, the Department of Earth Science, Manipur University has in its report of 1996 assessed the average runoff of Manipur River as 519,200 ha·m (4,209,000 acre·ft; 5.192 km3) from a total catchment area of at the Ithai barrage. The ground water potential has been assessed estimated around per annum.

==Water resources development==
Several water resources development projects have been built in the Manipur River basin to meet growing demands for irrigation. Seven river valley projects have been completed; these are the Singda Dam Project, Thoubal Dam Project and Khuga Dam Project which are of multipurpose type, the Imphal Barrage Project and the Sekmai Barrage Project—both medium irrigation projects. The most discussed project is the Loktak Multipurpose Project, which provides hydropower, irrigation and water supply benefits but has attracted adverse criticism for the drastic alteration caused by the project to the hydrological regime of the Loktak Lake and associated wetlands.

===Loktak Multipurpose Project===

The Loktak Hydropower Project on the Manipur River or Imphal River, with the Loktak Lake forming the head waters to provide regulated storage for power generation, was built in 1983 as a multipurpose project with power generation of 105 MW (3x35 MW) for power supply to Manipur, Nagaland, Assam, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Tripura, and lift irrigation to an area of in the Manipur valley. The main components of the project, as built, are, a) the Ithai Barrage, across the Manipur river of height and length with three spillway bays, b) water conductor system for trans-basin diversion comprising an open channel of length, a cut and cover section of length (bed width , followed by a Head Race Tunnel of diameter (horseshoe type) and long to carry a discharge of () for power generation and for irrigation), c) a surge shaft, d) penstocks and e) a surface powerhouse and a tailrace channel on the right bank of the narrow Leimatak River with three units of 35 MW capacity each generating an annual energy of 448 GW·h (1.613 PJ). The downstream Loktak Power Project in cascade to utilize the regulated releases from the upper project for further power generation of 90 MW is proposed to be taken up for joint implementation by NHPC and the Government of Manipur.
The project has invited severe criticism since the water level in the lake at the Ithai barrage is maintained throughout the year at FRL from considerations of power generation from the well planned water conductor system. The problem in the lake is, however, diverse; economic activities in and around the lake, and encroachments by 50,400 fishermen for extensive fishing activity are also cited to be some reasons. Other reasons for the distress situation in the lake are a) jhum (shifting) cultivation, b) extensive deforestation and unscientific land use practices in the catchment areas which bring large amount of silt into the lake and c) undefined ownership of the lake where the stakeholders are the districts of Imphal west district, Bishnupur and Thoubal causing lack of integrated approach to the lakes potential for providing benefits.

==Biodiversity==
A rich biodiversity with habitat heterogeneity has been recorded during a scientific survey carried out between January 2000 and December 2002 in different habitat patches of the lake. The lake’s rich biological diversity comprises 233 species of aquatic macrophytes of emergent, submergent, free-floating and rooted floating leaf types. But in the declining trend of vegetation, the important flora recorded are as under.

===Vegetation===
The important vegetation of the phumdis recorded are &quot;Eichhornia crassipes&quot;, &quot;Phragmites karka&quot;, &quot;Oryza sativa&quot;, &quot;Zizania latifolia&quot;, &quot;Cynodon&quot; spp., &quot;Limnophila&quot; spp., &quot;Sagittaria&quot; spp., &quot;Saccharum latifolium&quot;, &quot;Erianthus pucerus&quot;, &quot;Erianthus ravennae&quot;, &quot;Leersia hexandra&quot;, &quot;Carex&quot; spp.; &quot;Phragmites karka&quot; is reported to be the dominant species.

In the habitat patch with rooted floating plants, vegetation comprises the a) &quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot;, b) &quot;Trapa natans&quot;, c) &quot;Euryale ferox&quot;, d) &quot;Nymphaea alba&quot;, e) &quot;N. nouchali&quot;, &quot;N. stellata&quot; and f) &quot;Nymphoides indica&quot;.

=== Fauna===

57 species of waterbirds and another 14 species of wetland associated birds have been noted in the lake including 28 species of migratory waterfowl (most migrating from different parts of the northern hemisphere beyond the Himalayas). Also recorded were 425 species of animals—249 vertebrates and 176 invertebrates). The list includes rare animals such as the Indian python, sambhar and barking deer. Keibul Lamjao National Park is the natural habitat of one of the most endangered deer, the brow-antlered deer (&quot;Cervus eldi eldi&quot;) which was once thought to be extinct, which was declared a national park only to preserve and conserve this species of Eld&#x27;s deer.

;Avifauna
But the avifauna recorded in different habitats of the lake is reported to be declining. Briefly, the details of the avifauna recorded now are elaborated.

In the central part of the lake waterfowl, including dabbling ducks and diving ducks are reported but their numbers are declining due to proliferation of phumdis.

In the habitat part of the rooted plants, &quot;Hydrophasianus chirurgus&quot;, &quot;Metopidius indicus&quot;, and others were reported; once abundant now show a declining trend.

Small hillocks (though showing degraded condition) in the lake show big trees; birds of prey such as &quot;Milvus migrans lineatus&quot; and &quot;Circus aeruginosus&quot; have been recorded on these trees.

Species of hornbills found are the brown-backed hornbill, rufous-necked hornbill, wreathed hornbill, the pied hornbill and the great pied hornbill.

;Aqua fauna
Fish yield from the lake is reported to be about 1,500 tonnes (6,600,000 lb) every year. The State Fishery Department has introduced millions of fingerlings of Indian and exotic major carps. Natural capture fishery without the requirement of any lease or licence was also in vogue in the lake. The lake fishery is now a mixture of capture and culture systems. Nine mini-hatcheries opened by the State Government has the capacity to produce one million fish fingerlings in a day. Fifty percent of the fingerlings produced were released into the Loktak Lake and the balance were distributed to beneficiary fishing committees. The new fish varieties introduced in lake were grass carp, silver carp and the old varieties of the local fishes like &quot;Channa punctata&quot; (ngamu), &quot;Anabas testudineus&quot; (ukabi), &quot;Anguilla&quot; (ngaril), pangba, tharak, and ngashap stated to be under serious decline.

;Fauna

Fauna recorded in the precincts of the Lake in the Keibul Lamjo National Park are the Indian python, sambar, barking deer, the endangered sangai species of Eld&#x27;s deer, wild bear, &quot;Muntiacus muntjak&quot;, rhesus monkey, hoolock gibbon, stump-tailed macaque, Indian civet &quot;Viverra zibetha&quot;, marbled cat and Temminck&#x27;s golden cat.

==Threats ==
The Loktak lake and its precincts have faced serious problems due to loss of vegetal cover in the catchment area and construction of Ithai barrage at the outlet of the lake for multipurpose development of water resources. The issues are further elaborated below.

The degradation of the catchment area has occurred. Deforestation and shifting cultivation in the catchment areas have accelerated the process of soil erosion resulting in the lake’s shrinkage due to siltation. The annual silt flow into the lake is estimated to be 336,350 tonnes.

The nutrients from catchment area and domestic sewage from Imphal city carried by Nambul River are discharged into the lake affecting its water quality, thus encouraging the growth of water hyacinth and phumdis. All these activities have direct bearing on ecological stability of the lake. Interference in navigation and overall aesthetic value of the Lake are other reported adverse effects.

The construction of Ithai barrage and maintaining constant water level at full reservoir level (FRL) has led to a) changes in hydrological regime thereby affecting ecological processes and functions of the wetland, b) inundation of agricultural lands and displacement of people from flooded lands and c) loss of fish population and diversity.

Recent analysis of the concentrations of some elements with FAO limits showed non detection of toxic elements like As, Cd, Hg, and Pb. To a certain extent the water of the lake can be considered fresh in terms of trace elemental pollutants.

The thickness of phumdis has decreased in the Keibul Lamjao National Park thereby threatening the survival of sangai deer and interference in the migration of fishes from the Chindwin–Irrawaddy River system of Myanmar resulting in changes in the species composition.

The population of a number of economic plants such as &quot;Saccharum&quot; species, &quot;Setaria pumila&quot;, &quot;Alpinia nigra&quot;, &quot;Hedychium spicatum&quot; and the major food plants like the Zizania, Latifolia, &quot;Carex&quot; species, &quot;Coix&quot; species, Narenga has decreased resulting in starvation conditions for the endangered sangai deer. With the phumdis becoming thinner, the hoofs of the limbs of sangai get stuck in the marsh and results in their drowning. Production of the edible fruit and rhizome (&quot;thamchet&quot; and &quot;thambou&quot;) of lotus plants has decreased to a great extent. Plants have also degraded due to polluted water.

Livelihood of people dependent on the sale of edible fruit and rhizome of lotus plant products and &quot;Euryale ferox&quot; (thanging) has suffered due to steep decline in the growth of these plant species.

Today, Loktak Lake is at the highest level of eutrophication and the only brow-antlered deer is at the verge of extinction.

==Loktak Development Authority==
To address all the issues raised on the health of the lake, as detailed above, Government of Manipur has set up the Loktak Development Authority (LDA) under &quot;The Manipur Loktak Lake (Protection) Act, 2006 (Manipur Act 3 of 2006)&quot; with the objective &quot;to provide for administration, control, protection, improvement, conservation and development of the natural environment of the Loktak Lake and for matters connected with as incidental thereto.&quot;

==Restoration actions==
In order to address the various issues plaguing the functioning of the lake and the project dependent on it, a detailed project study was instituted by the Loktak Development Authority (LDA) &amp; Wetlands International Asia (WISA) with funding provided by the India Canada Environment Facility (ICEF). A Project Report titled &quot;Sustainable Development &amp; Water Resources Management of Loktak Lake (SDWRML)&quot; has been prepared. The report gives a review of its activities on the project done for over six years (from 1 February 1998 till the end of March 2004) with the following pertinent observations.

Based on all the analysis, the future approach suggested involves mitigation measures as elaborated are: i) The Nambol River carries sewage of nutrients of Imphal town into the lake which results in prolific growth of phumdis and deteriorates water quality. This is an urban problem and there is urgent need to treat and control this aspect, even if it is expensive;
ii) Reduce soil erosion and sedimentation of the lake by enlarging the scope of micro-watersheds in the catchment area treatment plan;
iii) Construct a channel through the Keibul Lamjao National Park to enable phumdis to settle at the bed of the lake;
iv) Resolve the encroachment problem, by demarcating the lake boundary, which would result in a targeted and concerted action plan;
v) Implement action plans that are economically viable and technically feasible resulting in livelihood enhancement such as evolving an attractive resettlement plan for the phumdi dwellers backed by remunerative livelihood program; and 
vi) Examine introduction of fishing net instead of Athapum (Athapam means phumdis in circular shape floating in the lake, planted or cultured artificially for catching fish) practiced presently to be dismantled. In November 2016, Environment ministry has taken keen interest in preserving loktak lake and has formed a panel of five members for this purpose.

==Visitor information==

Well connected by road and air, Imphal, the capital city of Manipur is away from the lake, by road. The lake is a unique destination for tourism. The lake offers excellent opportunities for visitors to enjoy the beauty of the lake and its several islands located inside it that are studded with floating phumdis of different geometrical shapes. The important islands which offer facilities for visitors are the Sandra and Phubala.
The Sendra Tourist Home on the island with an attached Cafeteria in the middle of the lake is an ideal tourist spot. Visitors get a bird&#x27;s eye view of life on the lake—small islands that are actually floating weed on which the lake people live.

Phubala resort, on the Phubala, is from Imphal.

At Moirang town on the fringe of the Loktak is the Indian National Army (INA) Museum which will be of interest to tourists. The exhibits include letters, photographs, badges of ranks and other articles associated with the INA. A bronze statue of Netaji Subash Chandra Bose in uniform stands in the lawn.

<text>Philip Barker Webb (10 July 1793 – 31 August 1854) was an English botanist.

== Life ==

Webb was born to a wealthy, aristocratic family; his father was the lord of the manors of Witley and Milford, in Surrey, England. Webb was educated at Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford. He collected plants in Italy, Spain, and Portugal, and was the first person to collect in the Tetuan Mountains of Morocco. En route to Brazil he made what was intended to be a brief visit to the Canary Islands, but he stayed for a considerable time, returning after his Brazil expedition.

The results can be seen in the nine-volume &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Iles Canaries&quot; (&quot;Natural History of the Canary Islands&quot;), which he co-authored with Sabin Berthelot. In company with Berthelot, who had lived on the islands for some time, Webb collected specimens on the islands between 1828 and 1830. The text of &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Iles Canaries&quot; took 20 years to complete.

Specialists such as Pierre-Justin-Marie Macquart wrote appropriate parts. Webb&#x27;s herbarium was bequeathed to the Museo di Storia Naturale di Firenze in Florence, Italy. He settled in Paris, but returned to Italy in the later years of his life, before being struck by illness while travelling in Europe. He died in England in August 1854.

 The former genera &quot;Barkerwebbia&quot; and &quot;Webbia&quot; were named after him.

== Works ==
* With Theodor von Heldreich he edited the exsiccata &quot;Catalogus plantarum hispanicarum in Provincia Giennensi (Provincia de Jaén) anno 1849 a Antonio Blanco lectarum&quot; to distribute a series of plant specimens collected by Antonio Blanco.

<text>Tourism in the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR) was organised through the state via &quot;Reisebüro der DDR&quot; (Travel Bureau of the GDR).

==For foreigners==
===Types of travel===
====Tours====
A traveller would first book their trip at a travel agent that was accredited by the &quot;Reisebüro&quot;. The travel agent would then offer the traveller a choice of any of the many package tours that the &quot;Reisebüro&quot; offered. In some countries, travellers could book trips through participating domestic travel agents, which would then coordinate with the Reisebüro to make reservations.

====Individual travel====
Independent travel was permitted within the GDR, with motoring or taking a railway trip through the country being the most popular options. The itinerary would be arranged through the &quot;Reisebüro&quot;, and visits could be arranged at border posts and other &quot;Reisebüro&quot; offices in the GDR. More complicated excursions would be arranged before arrival, and the formalities involved with a holiday in the GDR (such as the visa, any hotel bookings, advice on currency exchange, etc.) would be taken care of by the &quot;Reisebüro&quot;. This made the border crossing between East and West Germany much smoother.

===Formalities===
As with all states, foreign nationals from countries without the appropriate treaties were required to have visas to enter or exit the GDR. An exception involved military and civilian government personnel of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France based in West Germany and West Berlin who, when transiting to and from West Berlin via land routes (i.e., road and rail) and when in East Berlin, were under the jurisdiction of the Soviet Armed Forces and not the East German government.

There were four basic types of visas:
* Non-stop transit visa (for example, for travellers transiting between West Germany and West Berlin)
* Transit visa (with 72-hour stopover)
* Standard entry and exit visa &quot;(Visum zur Ein- und Ausreise)&quot;
* Day visa &quot;(Tagesvisum)&quot; for tourists from West Berlin wanting to visit East Berlin.

Additional rules applied to diplomats, journalists, business travellers, and other non-tourist visitors.

All of the four basic visa types could, in theory, be arranged at the &quot;Reisebüro&quot; offices at the main border crossings. In practice, to avoid the bureaucracy in obtaining an entry visa, it was simply easier to enter East Berlin on a day visa and then have an extension arranged at a &quot;Reisebüro&quot; office in the city. Visitors to East Germany could only enter the country by car, bus, or train – not by bicycle or on foot. The exceptions to this were international airports, as well as Checkpoint Charlie. A special case involved the Friedrichstraße train station in East Berlin, which one could reach from West Berlin by U-Bahn, S-Bahn, or long-distance train.

Visitors not on non-stop transit visas were required to change a minimum of DM25, or its equivalent in other hard currency, into GDR marks every day of their stay at the standard rate of 1:1. An exception was made for persons booking overnight hotel stays in the GDR, as the hotel charges were payable in hard currency and almost always exceeded the minimum daily exchange amount. The visa fee itself was an additional DM5–15 (depending on the type of visa).

In addition to visas, travellers to the GDR staying overnight (or longer) were required to register with the &quot;Volkspolizei&quot; (The People&#x27;s Police). An &quot;Aufenthaltsberechtigung&quot; (residence entitlement) stamp would be placed in the traveller&#x27;s passport; the names of each city or &quot;Bezirk&quot; (region) where the traveller was registered, as well as the expiration date of the registration, would be entered in the appropriate space. Many times, the hotel where the traveller stayed would take care of this for the traveller by taking the passport at check-in, giving the traveller a receipt, and returning the passport to the traveller the next morning, removing any inconvenience.

===Customs===
Gifts up to the value of 200 East German marks could be imported. This was not based on the price the traveller would have paid for them at home, but rather the price the item would sell for in East Germany.

===Accommodations===
====Hotels====
Visitors to the GDR generally stayed in hotels belonging to the state-run &quot;Interhotel&quot; network. Contrary to the expectations of Westerners who envisioned the GDR hotels as run down, &quot;Interhotels&quot; (especially the Metropol and Grand Hotels in East Berlin, the Bellevue in Dresden, and the Merkur in Leipzig) met or exceeded international standards for hotel accommodations.

There were four classes of hotels:
*Deluxe – a minimum of 100 GDR marks per night per person
*Expensive – 90–100 GDR marks
*Moderate – 70–90 GDR marks
*Inexpensive – 40–70 GDR marks

A room with a private bath would cost an extra 5 or 10 GDR marks. As previously noted, Western travellers were required to pay hotel charges in hard currency, even though the charges might be denominated in GDR marks.

====Camping====
Thirty campsites run by Intercamp dotted the GDR in the following areas:

*East Berlin
*Baltic coast
*Mecklenburg lake district
*Dresden and surrounding area
*Erfurt
*Leipzig
*Harz Mountains

Intercamp sites were open from 1 May to 30 September and were equipped with electricity, sanitation, running water, and other facilities. As with many equivalent private schemes in Western countries, booking in advance was required.

====Youth hostels====
East German youth hostels were not officially open to Westerners, but sometimes Westerners were allowed to use them if space was available.

==Tipping==
Initially, tipping was officially forbidden by the government, which viewed it as distinctly &quot;bourgeois&quot; (receiving extra money without actually doing anything extra). However, the attempt failed.

==Things to see==
===East Berlin===
East Berlin was rebuilt as a modern capital after World War II. The hub of the city was the Alexanderplatz, a pedestrian square. Other tourist attractions included the &quot;Fernsehturm&quot; (the TV Tower), the Palast der Republik (the East German legislative building), and the Brandenburg Gate (then walled off with the Berlin Wall).

Potsdam was also heavily promoted by the East German government, particularly Sanssouci and the surrounding gardens, which was the former summer palace of Frederick the Great.

===The Baltic Coast===
The East German government developed a series of beach resorts for Western tourists along the coast in the districts of the state nowadays called Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.

===Erzgebirge Ore Mountains and Thuringia Forests===
The Erzgebirge Ore Mountains contained the GDR&#x27;s highest point, Fichtelberg (). Oberhof, a resort town in the Thuringia forests, contained an artificial luge/bobsled run.

===Eisenhüttenstadt===
Eisenhüttenstadt is a city on the Oder River near the border with Poland. The city was originally named Stalinstadt, but the name changed during the Destalinization period. The buildings of Eisenhüttenstadt are an archetypal example of modernist architecture and the city was styled as a &quot;model socialist city&quot; when it was constructed by the East German government in 1950.

==Freikörperkultur==
FKK was legal.

It is in area, the only floating national park in the world, and an integral part of Loktak Lake. It is currently under the tentative lists of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, under the title &quot;Keibul Lamjao Conservation Area (KLCA)&quot;, additionally covering the buffer of Loktak Lake (140 sq km) and Pumlen Pat (43 sq. km).

The national park is characterized by floating decomposed plant material locally called phumdi. It was created in 1966 as a wildlife sanctuary to preserve the natural habitat of the endangered Eld&#x27;s deer (&quot;Cervus eldi eldi&quot;). In 1977, it was gazetted as national park.

==History==
The brow-antlered deer, which was first discovered in Manipur in 1839 and named &quot;Cervus eldi eldi&quot; in 1844 in honour of Lt. Percy Eld – a British officer, was reported an extinct species in 1951. It was re–discovered in the Keibul Lamjao Park area by the environmentalist and photographer E.P. Gee, which necessitated declaring this reserve park area as a national park to protect and conserve the deer now called Eld&#x27;s deer&#x27;s subspecies brow-antlered deer () or in Meitei language (to distinguish it from the other two subspecies found in Burma and Thailand that are called and and also in Cambodia, China, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam and Hainan Island). It has a pride of place in the folklore and culture of the Manipur state and is the state animal of Manipur. From a small herd of 14 deer in 1975, its population was reportedly 155 in 1995 and as per the latest wildlife census conducted in March 2016 its number rose to 260.

==Geography and topography==
The park is a swamp with floating mass of vegetation created by accrual of organic detritus and biomass with soil particles that has been thickened into a solid form called phumdis, at the south–eastern side of the Loktak Lake, which has been declared a Ramsar site. Two thirds to three fourths of the total park area is formed by phumdis. A waterway through the park provides year-round access by boats plying through the Loktak Lake, to the Pabot Hill in the north. The reserve area of the park which was in March 1997 was reduced to in April 1998, under pressure from the local villagers. The swamp encompasses three hills, namely, Pabot, Toya and Chingjao that provide a refuge for the large mammals during the monsoon season. The distinctive nature of the park is that it is &quot;too deep to be marsh, too shallow to be a lake&quot;.

===Ownership rights===
While the area on the periphery of the park is privately owned, the park itself is predominantly state-owned.

==Hydrologic features==
Hydro–meteorological feature of the area is marked by the dominance of the Indian tropical monsoon with an average annual rainfall of with July and August as the wettest months and February and March as the driest.

The size of the park varies with the seasons as it is formed of phumdis (morass of organic matter). The peripheral areas of the lake are grounded to the bed of the lake during the dry season but get almost substantially submerged for a few days during the monsoon season. It emerges and floats to the surface fully a few days later, separating from the ground; the depth of the Phumdi varies from to and during this period the animals in the park move to higher hilly areas. About twenty percent of its thickness floats on the lake, above the surface, which supports the weight of large mammals.

;Weather
Temperatures vary from a maximum of in summer to a minimum of in winter. Humidity was a recorded high of 81% in August with a minimum of 49% in March.

==Flora and fauna==

The park, primarily composed of moist semi–evergreen forests, has a rich amalgam of aquatic, wetland and terrestrial ecosystem. The grass land structure of the park is divided into three zones.

===Aquatic flora===
Aquatic flora recorded in the park include &quot;Zizania latifolia&quot; (wild rice, &quot;ishing kambong&quot;), &quot;Tripidium bengalense&quot;, &quot;Eiranthus procerus&quot; (&quot;singnang&quot;), &quot;Dioscorea bulbifera&quot; (&quot;phumha&quot;), &quot;Cynodon dactylon&quot; (&quot;tinthou&quot;), &quot;Alpinia galanga&quot; (&quot;pullei&quot;), &quot;Eichhornia crassipes&quot; (&quot;kabokang&quot;), &quot;Hedychium coronarium&quot; (&quot;loklei&quot;), &quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot; (&quot;thambal&quot;) and &quot;Phragmites karka&quot; (&quot;tou&quot;).

Some of the above-listed flora had been recorded in two types of &quot;phumdis&quot; namely, the &quot;phumdi ataoba&quot; (floating) and the &quot;phumdi aruppa&quot; (sinking); reeds, grasses, and other plants growing on a mat of dead and decaying vegetation floating on the lake surface form the &quot;ataoba&quot;, while &quot;Phumdi aruppa&quot; has mats of vegetation which have sunk to the bottom of the lake and support a rich emergent growth of reeds and grasses. In a 1960 estimate, the &quot;phumdi&quot; vegetation had been structured into 45% &quot;Phragmites karka&quot;, 25% &quot;Erianthus ravennae&quot; (elephant grass), 15% &quot;Saccharum munja&quot;, 5% &quot;S. latifolium&quot;, 5% &quot;Alpinia allughas&quot; and 2% &quot;Saccharum procerum&quot; and 3% other species, including &quot;Zizania latifolia&quot;; &quot;Zizania latifolia&quot; is the plant much relished by the &quot;sangai deer&quot;. &quot;Eichhornia crassipes&quot; was a recent species in the open water areas of the swamp in the midst of &quot;Polygonum&quot; (buckwheat) and &quot;Trapa&quot; (water caltrop or water chestnut). The three hills surrounding the park are now denuded of most of the vegetation.

===Fauna===
Apart from the brow-antlered deer (&quot;Cervus eldi eldi&quot;), the flagship species of the park, other fauna found in the park were the following:
*Mammals reported are the hog deer (&quot;C. porcinus&quot;), wild boar (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;), large Indian civet (&quot;Viverra civetta&quot;), common otter (&quot;Lutra lutra&quot;), fox, jungle cat (&quot;Felis chaus&quot;), Asian golden cat, bay bamboo rat, musk shrew, common shrew, flying fox and sambar (&quot;Cervus unicolor&quot;).
*Fishes include &quot;Channa striata&quot;, &quot;Channa punctatus&quot;, common carp, &quot;Wallago attu&quot; and pool barb. 
*Amphibians and reptiles include the keel back tortoise, viper, krait, cobra, water cobra, banded krait, Asian rat snake (beauty rat snake), &quot;python&quot;, Russel&#x27;s viper (&quot;Daboia&quot;), checkered garter snake and common lizard (&quot;Viviparous lizard&quot;). &quot;Python molurus&quot; is also found in the park.

===Avifauna===
Prominent bird species recorded in the park are both migratory and resident. Some of them are the East Himalayan pied kingfisher, black kite, lesser sky-lark, northern hill myna, Indian pied myna, North Indian black drongos, lesser eastern jungle crow, yellow headed wagtail, spotbill duck, blue-winged teal, ruddy shell duck, threatened hooded crane, Burmese sarus sarus crane, Indian white-breasted waterhen and crimson-breasted pied woodpecker.

==Threats==

Some of the identified threats to the park are elaborated below.

# The threats to the park are due to the permanent flooding of the park and its resultant effect on the thickness of phumdis. The reason attributed for this is due to construction of the Ithai Barrage under the Loktak Multi-Purpose Project in 1983 where high level of water is maintained (between and ) during October to March – the dry months of the year. This has disturbed the natural cycle of floating and sinking of phumdis which used to be maintained in the park. Maintenance of high water level in the lake throughout the year for Loktak Multipurpose Project has broken this annual cycle and phumdis remain floating throughout the year during dry season and are no more available to phumdi vegetation. Therefore, the growth of vegetation on phumdis and their thickness are believed to be gradually decreasing.
# Before the construction of the Loktak Hydro Electric Project, the phumdis floated during flooding by backflow from the Khordak River and discharge from other streams and nalas and settled down on lake bed during dry season when water was drawn out through the same river. This resulted in enhancing of nutrients and minerals of the phumdi vegetation from the bottom of the lake during the dry period. But this cycle has been disturbed by the Loktak Hydro Electric project. One apprehension is that at some stage the phumdis may not be able to support the number of the Eld&#x27;s deer or sangai deer.
# The national park and the Loktak Lake have provided sustenance (through fishing, growing, and collection of vegetables of economic importance) to the people living in the peripheral villages and on the phumdis. The effect of maintaining permanently high water level is stated to be a serious threat to the phumdis and consequently to the people living on the lake/park&#x27;s natural resources.
# Earlier, there was only marshy land in the park area but after commissioning of the hydroelectric project two ecosystems have emerged; one with water body covering one-third area and the other the &quot;phumdis&quot;, which covers two-thirds area.
# Deteriorating water quality is indicated by the recorded pH values of 4 to 8.5. The reasons for poor quality are attributed to flow of 
##pollutants from the towns draining into the lake, 
##use of agrochemicals for farming in the surrounding farmland, 
##accumulation of water on phumdi, 
##deforestation and subsequent soil erosion in the catchment area and 
##rotting vegetation.

==Conservation measures==
Conservation measures suggested relate to development and implementation of a management plan giving priority to long term conservation, monitoring the condition of habitat and to take timely corrective measures by enforcing strict protection of core areas, particularly with reference to the water level due to the Loktak Hydro Electric Power Project. 

Some of the measures suggested and under implementation are elaborated as 

# provide effective protection, 
# developing and maintaining high places with adequate protection and food material to provide protection to the animals in case of flash flood, 
# increasing area under phumdis in the park, 
# preventing theft of phumdis and flow or part of phumdis towards northern side, 
# topping completely the collection of firewood, food and fodder, 
# creating an environment in which local people volunteer as natural custodian of sangai and other animals in the park, 
# to encourage ecotourism and nature education, 
# to undertake, aid, promote and co–ordinate research works, 
# capacity building, training, awareness and extension activities, 
# launching packaging and publicity campaign and 
# propagating ethnic information, exhibition and so forth.
Conservation measures implemented
The measures that have been implemented by the Forest Department of the Manipur Government are the following.

# A perimeter fence of length in most vulnerable sections of the park to prevent people and domestic livestock from entering the reserve has been created
# A cattle-proof trench has been dug along of the boundary
# Seven canoes and four checkpoints are established at strategic places for security.
# Army helicopter has carried out census work.
# The park is under the supervision of full–time forest officials.
# Capacity building has been achieved by exclusive placement of an Assistant Conservator of Forests, an assistant veterinary surgeon, a ranger of forests, field assistant, three foresters, four forest guards and eight others for the park.

==Visitor information==

The park is approachable by road, rail and air through Imphal, the capital of Manipur. By road it is from Imphal and from Guwahati (Assam) on the National Highway No. 53. Public and private transport ply on these roads.

The nearest rail head is at Jiribam is a railhead on the Manipur border, which is from Imphal.. And Rani Gaidinliu station at Tamenglong is the nearest station which is from Imphal and from the national park. 

Resorts under the Classic Hotel for family and travel-loving couple are available in the Sendra island park which is 5-6 kilometers away from the National Park. Basic accommodation of a forest rest house without boarding facilities is available at Phubala and Sendra islands inside the park and at Moirang town away from the park. Staying at Imphal which has better hotel facilities is a preferred option.

Visit to the park is ideal between 0600 and 1000 hrs in the morning and 1530 and 1800 hrs in the afternoon, when the sangai deer comes out to feed in herds. A boat trip along the labyrinthine boat routes passing through colourful water plants would be a good way to see the park. An adventurous trip would be to take a walk through the park but the phumdi is not a firm ground. Manipur Tourism Department arranges conducted day tours to the Loktak Lake and the Keibul Lamjao Park.

Manipur is considered a sensitive border state. Earlier the Foreigners entering Manipur (including foreign citizens born in Manipur) was needed to possess a Restricted Area Permit, but now it has been lifted from the state. There is no permit required for foreigners coming to Manipur, they only need to register themselves in the established check points i.e. Imphal Airport and (Mao and Jiribam) for those coming by road.

<text>Sabin Berthelot (4 April 1794 – 10 November 1880) was a French naturalist and ethnologist. He was a resident of the Canary Islands for part of his life, and co-authored &quot;L&#x27;Histoire Naturelle des Îles Canaries&quot; (1835–50) with Philip Barker Webb.

== Biography ==

Berthelot was the son of a Marseille merchant. He joined the French Navy and served as a midshipman during the Napoleonic Wars. After the war he joined the merchant fleet, travelling between Marseilles and the West Indies. He first visited the Canary Islands in 1820, where he taught at a school in Tenerife and managed the botanical gardens at Orotava for the Marquis of Villanueva del Prato.

Berthelot studied the natural history of the islands. He was joined in this task by Webb in 1828, and by 1830 they had collected sufficient information for publication. They travelled to Geneva, and produced the first volume of &quot;L&#x27;Histoire Naturelle des Îles Canaries&quot; in 1835. Berthelot concentrated on the ethnography, history and geography of the islands, with Webb completing the natural history sections. The ornithological section was mainly written by Alfred Moquin-Tandon.

In 1845 Berthelot founded the Société d&#x27;Ethnologique. In 1846 he returned to Tenerife, and in 1848 was nominated the French consular agent for the island, being promoted to full Consul in 1867. He retired in August 1874, and was given the freedom of the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife.

Berthelot&#x27;s other publications on the islands included &quot;Les Guanches&quot; (1841 and 1845), &quot;La Conquète des canaries&quot; (1879) and &quot;Antiquités Canariennes&quot; (1879).

== Legacy ==
The Berthelot&#x27;s pipit (&quot;Anthus berthelotii&quot;) was named after him by his friend Carl Bolle.

<doc id="730092" wikidata="Q548685" url="?curid=730092" title="Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary">
<text>The Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary is a Marian litany originally approved in 1587 by Pope Sixtus V. It is also known as the Litany of Loreto (Latin: &quot;Litaniae lauretanae&quot;), after its first-known place of origin, the Shrine of Our Lady of Loreto (Italy), where its usage was recorded as early as 1558.

The litany contains many of the titles used formally and informally for the Virgin Mary, and would often be recited as a call and response chant in a group setting. They are used to recite or sing at the end of the Rosary, and as a separate act of Marian devotion. In the latter case, for example, they can form the main element of a celebration of prayer to the Most Blessed Virgin, be a processional song, or form part of a celebration of the Word of God.

A partial indulgence is granted to those who recite this litany.

==Background==
According to &quot;Directory on Popular Piety&quot;:

 Litanies are to be found among the prayers to the Blessed Virgin recommended by the Magisterium. These consist in a long series of invocations of Our Lady, which follow in a uniform rhythm, thereby creating a stream of prayer characterized by insistent praise and supplication. The invocations, generally very short, have two parts: the first of praise (Virgo clemens), the other of supplication (Ora pro nobis). The liturgical books contain two Marian litanies: The Litany of Loreto, repeatedly recommended by the Roman Pontiffs; and the Litany for the Coronation of Images of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which can be an appropriate substitute for the other litany on certain occasions. ...The Litanies are independent acts of worship. They are important acts of homage to the Blessed Virgin Mary, or as processional elements, or form part of a celebration of the Word of God or of other acts of worship.

==Form==
In form, the Litany of Loreto is based on a fixed plan common to several Marian litanies already in existence during the second half of the 15th century, which in turn are connected to a notable series of Marian litanies that began to appear in the 12th century that multiplied in the 13th and 14th. The Loreto text had, however, the good fortune to be adopted in the famous shrine, and thus become known more than any other, to the many pilgrims who flocked there during the 16th century. The text was spread across Christendom, and finally received ecclesiastical sanction.

Twelve invocations refer to Mary as Mother; six extol her as Virgin. Thirteen titles are derived from the Old Testament, followed by four calling on her as helper and advocate. The last thirteen name Mary as Queen. In June 2020, Pope Francis added three new invocations to the litany: &quot;Mother of Mercy&quot; (after Mother of the Church), &quot;Mother of hope&quot; (after Mother of Divine Grace), and &quot;Solace of Migrants&quot; (after Refuge of Sinners). This makes fourteen invocations referring to Mary as mother and five as advocate.

A litany is prayed like this: first an invocation is said by the prayer leader followed by the response, &quot;Pray for us&quot;.

== The Litany ==
The Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary was translated in the English form as:

The subsequent oration is:
:Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God, ℟ That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.
:Grant, we beseech Thee, O Lord God, that we Thy Servants may enjoy perpetual health of mind and body and by the glorious intercession of the Blessed Mary, ever Virgin, be delivered from present sorrow and enjoy eternal happiness. Through Christ Our Lord. Amen.

== History ==
===Origins===
There is a great lack of documentary evidence concerning the origin of the Litany of Loreto, the growth and development of the litany into the forms under which it is known, and as it was for the first time definitely approved by the Catholic Church in the year 1587. Some writers declare that they know nothing of its origin and history; others, on the contrary, trace it back to the translation of the Holy House (1294); others, to Pope Sergius I (687); others, again, to Gregory the Great or to the 5th century; while others go as far back as the Early Church, and even the Apostolic Age. Historical criticism posits it to have been composed during the early 16th century or the end of the 15th. Before that time, there were litanies of Mary - one in Gaelic, probably of the eighth century, and others of later date, in which the invocations were much longer than those in the Litany of Loreto. For others, the first formularies of Marian litanies are documented from the second half of the 12th century and derive from the development of the Marian core of the &quot;Litany of the saints&quot;, which originated in the early 3rd century.

The oldest formulary from which the litanies that took the name &#x27;Lauretane&#x27; from the sanctuary of the Holy House of Loreto, where they were sung at the beginning of the 16th century, derive is a manuscript codex in the National Library of France that contains 73 invocations, including &quot;Flos virginitatis&quot; (= Flower of virginity), &quot;Forma sanctitatis&quot; (= Model of sanctity), &quot;Hymnus cælorum&quot; (= Hymn of heaven), &quot;Luctus infernorum&quot; (= Mourning of Hell), in addition to the invocations currently in use.

The 66 Marian invocations in the Parisian text cited above already have the structure of the Loreto litanies and are arranged similarly to those in the Loreto formulary. The structure is as follows: it begins with three invocations taken from the litanies of the saints (SanctaMaria, Sancta Dei Genitrix, Sancta Virgo Virginum), followed by a group of eleven invocations in which Mary is considered as &#x27;Mother&#x27; (in Latin: &quot;Mater&quot;), then four invocations as &#x27;teacher&#x27; (&quot;Magistra&quot;), a group that has disappeared in today&#x27;s Lauretan litanies, eight invocations in which Our Lady is considered as &#x27;Virgin&#x27; (&quot;Virgo&quot;), twenty-six symbolic titles of basically biblical origin, and finally thirteen invocations to Mary Queen (&quot;Regina&quot;). The various titles under which the Virgin was invoked derive from liturgical texts, contemporary authors, and homilies from the time of Charlemagne, with links to older texts: John Geometres (10th century), Venantius Fortunatus (c. 530-660), the hymn &quot;Akathist&quot;, Ephrem the Syrian (c. 306-372).

The oldest printed copy hitherto discovered is that of Dillingen in Germany, dating to 1558; it is fairly certain it is a copy of an earlier one, but thus far, the oldest known Italian copy dates from 1576.

The litany was probably published and circulated in Germany by Saint Petrus Canisius. The Dillingen copy is entitled: &quot;Letania Loretana. Ordnung der Letaney von unser lieben Frawen wie sie zu Loreto alle Samstag gehalten&quot; (&quot;Order of the Litany of Our Lady as said every Saturday at Loreto&quot;). The text is just the same as we have it today, except that it has &quot;Mater piissima&quot; and &quot;Mater mirabilis&quot;, where now are &quot;Mater purissima&quot; and &quot;Mater admirabilis&quot;. Further, the invocations &quot;Mater creatoris&quot; and &quot;Mater salvatoris&quot; are wanting, though this must be due to some oversight of the editor, since they are found in every manuscript of this group; on the other hand, the &quot;Auxilium christianorum&quot; is introduced though it does not occur in the other texts. This title is found in a Litany of Loreto printed in 1558. Pope Pius V could not have introduced the invocation &quot;&quot;Auxilium christianorum&quot; in 1571 after the Battle of Lepanto, as stated in the sixth lesson of the Roman Breviary for the feast of S. Maria Auxiliatrix (24 May); and to this conclusion the Dillingen text adds indisputable evidence.

==Development==
Pope Pius V by &quot;Motu Proprio&quot; of 20 March 1571, published 5 April, had suppressed all existing offices of the Virgin Mary, disapproving in general all the prayers therein, and substituting a new &quot;Officium B. Virginis&quot; without those prayers and consequently without any litany. It would seem that this action on the part of the pope led the clergy of Loreto to fear that the text of their litany was likewise prohibited. At all events, in order to keep the old custom of singing the litany every Saturday in honor of the Virgin, a new text was written containing praises drawn directly from Scriptures and usually applied to the Virgin in liturgies. This new litany was set to music by the choirmaster of the Basilica of Loreto, Costanzo Porta, and printed at Venice in 1575. It is the earliest setting to music of a Marian litany that we know of. In the following year (1576) these Scriptural litanies were printed for the use of pilgrims.
On 5 February 1578, the archdeacon of Loreto, Giulio Candiotti, sent to Pope Gregory XIII the &quot;New praises or litanies of the most holy Virgin, drawn from Sacred Scripture&quot;, with Porta&#x27;s music, expressing the wish that the pope would cause it to be sung in Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica and in other churches as was the custom at Loreto. The pope&#x27;s reply is unknown, but we have the opinion of the theologian to whom the matter was referred, in which the composition of the new litany is praised, but which does not judge it opportune to introduce it into Rome or into church use on the authority of the pope, all the more because Pius V &quot;in reforming the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin completely abolished, among other things, some similar litanies of the Blessed Virgin which existed in the old office. The judgment concluded that the litany might be sung at Loreto as a devotion proper to this shrine, and if others wanted to adopt it they might do so by way of private devotion.

This attempt having failed, the Scriptural litany straightway began to lose favor, and the Loreto text was revived. In another manual for pilgrims, published in 1578, the Scriptural litany is omitted, and the old Loreto text appears. The Loreto text was introduced elsewhere, and even reached Rome, when Pope Sixtus V, who had entertained a singular devotion for Loreto, by the Bull &quot;Reddituri&quot; of 11 July 1587, gave formal approval to it, as to the Litany of the Holy Name of Jesus, and recommended preachers everywhere to propagate its use among the faithful.

On the strength of this impulse given to the Litany of Loreto, certain ascetical writers began to publish a great number of litanies in honour of the Saviour, the Virgin, and the saints, often ill-advised and containing expressions theologically heterodox, so Pope Clement VIII had promulgated (6 Sept., 1601) a severe decree of the Holy Office, which, while upholding the litanies contained in the liturgical books as well as the Litany of Loreto, banned the publication of new litanies, or use of those already published in public worship, without the approbation of the Congregation of Rites.

In Rome, the Litany of Loreto was introduced into the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore by Cardinal Francesco Toledo in 1597; and in 1613, Pope Paul V ordered it to be sung in that church, morning and evening, on Saturdays and on vigils and feasts of the Madonna. As a result of this example, the Loreto Litany began to be used, and is still largely used, in all the churches of Rome. The Dominicans, in their general chapter held at Bologna in 1615, ordered its recitation in all the convents of their Order after the Office on Saturdays at the end of the customary &quot;Salve Regina&quot;. The Litany of Loreto was first included in the &quot;Rituale Romanum&quot; in 1874, as an appendix.

==Additions==
* The Dominicans caused the invocation &quot;Regina sacratissimi rosarii&quot; (&quot;Queen of the Most Holy Rosary&quot;) to be inserted in the litany, and it appears in print for the first time in a Dominican Breviary dated 1614, as has been pointed out by Father Walsh, O.P., in &quot;The Tablet&quot;, 24 October 1908. Although by decree of 1631, and by Bull of Pope Alexander VII (1664), it was strictly forbidden to make any additions to the litanies, another decree of the Congregation of Rites, dated 1675, permitted the Confraternity of the Rosary to add the invocation &quot;Regina sacratissimi rosarii&quot;, and this was prescribed for the whole Church by Pope Leo XIII on 24 December 1883.
* The invocation Queen of All saints was added by Pope Pius VII when he returned to Rome after his long imprisonment by order of Napoleon. 
* In 1766 Clement XIII granted Spain the privilege of adding after &quot;Mater intemerata&quot; the invocation &quot;Mater immaculata&quot;, which is still customary in Spain, notwithstanding the addition of &quot;Regina sine labe originali concepta&quot;. This last invocation was originally granted by Pope Pius IX to the Bishop of Mechelen in 1846, and, after the definition of the Immaculate Conception (1854), the Congregation by various rescripts authorized many dioceses to make a like addition, so that in a short time it became the universal practice. The title Queen conceived without original sin was granted by Pope Gregory XVI (1831-1846) from 1839 to certain dioceses; Pius IX (1846-1878) granted it in 1846 to the archdiocese of Malines and, after the definition of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception (8 December 1854), the Sacred Congregation of Rites with various rescripts authorised many dioceses to make the addition, so that in a short time it became universal practice (the addition did not become obligatory during the pontificate of Pope Pius IX, so much so that it is indicated as optional for dioceses that obtained an apostolic indult in the &quot;Rituale Romanum&quot; of 1881
* By decree of 22 April 1903, Pope Leo XIII added the invocation &quot;Mater boni consilii&quot; (Mother of Good Counsel), which, under the form of &quot;Mater veri consilii&quot;, was contained in the Marian litany used for centuries in St Mark&#x27;s Basilica, Venice. 
* The addition Queen of peace was ordered by Pope Benedict XV in 1916.
* In 1950, Pope Pius XII added Queen assumed into heaven.
* In 1980, Pope John Paul II added &quot;Mother of the church&quot;. The invocation Queen of families was added on 31 December 1995, also by Pope John Paul II.
* On 20 June 2020, during the Feast of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, Pope Francis added three invocations: Mother of mercy, Mother of hope, and Solace of migrants.

==Indulgence==
The 2004 &quot;Enchiridion Indulgentiarum&quot; grants the partial indulgence to the faithfuls of Christ who piously pray the litanies.

<text>Christian Horace Benedict Alfred Moquin-Tandon (7 May 1804 – 15 April 1863) was a French naturalist and doctor.

Moquin-Tandon was professor of zoology at Marseille from 1829 until 1833, when he was appointed professor of botany and director of the botanical gardens at Toulouse. In 1850, he was sent by the French government to Corsica to study the island&#x27;s flora. In 1853, he moved to Paris, later becoming director of the Jardin des Plantes and the Académie des Sciences.

His books included the ornithology section of &quot;L&#x27;Histoire Naturelle des Iles Canaries&quot; (1835–44), co-authored with Philip Barker Webb and Sabin Berthelot.

One of his specialities was the family Amaranthaceae (The Amaranth family).

Several genera of plants have been named in his honour, including in 1838, DC. published &quot;Moquinia&quot;, a genus of flowering plants from Brazil, in the &quot;Moquinia&quot; tribe within the sunflower family. Then in 1954, Simone Balle published &quot;Moquiniella&quot; a genus of flowering plants from Africa, belonging to the family Loranthaceae. Lastly in 2013, botanists (Cabrera) G.Sancho published &quot;Moquiniastrum&quot;, a genus of flowering plants from South America, belonging to the family Asteraceae.

<doc id="730099" wikidata="Q7079543" url="?curid=730099" title="Official Opposition (India)">
<text>In India, Official Opposition designates largest party not supporting the ruling cabinet in the Parliament of India or a State or Territory Legislative Assembly. To get formal recognition in either upper or lower houses, the concerned party must have at least 10% of the total strength of the house.

== Role ==

The Opposition&#x27;s main role is to question the government of the day and hold them accountable to the public. This also helps to fix the mistakes of the Ruling Party. The Opposition is equally responsible in upholding the best interests of the people of the country. They have to ensure that the Government does not take any steps, which might have negative effects on the people of the country.

The role of the opposition in legislature is basically to check the excesses of the ruling or dominant party, and not to be totally antagonistic. There are actions of the ruling party which may be beneficial to the masses and opposition is expected to support such steps.

In legislature the Opposition Party has a major role, which is:

# Constructive criticism of government.
# Putting restriction on arbitrariness of ruling party. 
# Safeguarding liberty and right of people.
# Preparation to form government.
# Expression of public opinion.

<doc id="730100" wikidata="Q13569908" url="?curid=730100" title="Jim Bohannon">
<text>James Everett Bohannon (January 7, 1944 – November 12, 2022) was an American broadcaster who worked in television and radio and hosted the nationally syndicated late night radio talk show &quot;The Jim Bohannon Show&quot; originally broadcast on the Mutual Broadcasting System and later the Westwood One Network from 1985 to 2022. For 31 years, he also hosted &quot;America in The Morning&quot;, a nationally syndicated radio news show, stepping down in December 2015.

Bohannon was included numerous times in &quot;Talkers&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual &quot;Heavy 100&quot; picks of &quot;The 100 Most Important Radio Talk Show Hosts in America&quot;. He was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2003, and in 2013 was the recipient of &quot;Talkers&quot; Lifetime Achievement Award. He was also nominated for the Marconi Award for Network Syndicated Personality of the Year presented by the National Association of Broadcasters. In December 2021, Bohannon was announced as an inductee into the NAB&#x27;s Broadcasting Hall of Fame.

==Early life and education==
Bohannon was born in Corvallis, Oregon, and raised in Lebanon, Missouri. His broadcasting career began KLWT in his hometown of Lebanon, Missouri, in 1960, where he worke for a dollar per hour. Following his graduation from Lebanon High School in 1962, Bohannon attended Southwest Missouri State University, now known as Missouri State University, in Springfield. While in college he continued to work in radio part-time at KWTO as a news reporter, and at KICK as a disc jockey. One event in 1964 helped set the tone for Bohannon&#x27;s later career and ability to think on his feet. Presidential candidate Senator Barry Goldwater made a campaign appearance in Springfield, which KWTO was covering by live remote broadcast. However the Senator was running late, forcing the young Bohannon to ad lib on air for over an hour to fill the time. As he told &quot;Inside Radio&quot; in a 2003 interview: &quot;I called on everything I had in reserve. I was ad libbing and making comments about the campaign. It was like being dumped in the middle of the English Channel and told you needed to learn how to swim. That sticks out as a time I was given a big test.&quot; Another highlight for Bohannon while working in radio in those early years was taking three busloads of fans from Springfield to Kansas City, Missouri, to see The Beatles in concert.

==Career==
===Military service===
After his graduation from Southwest Missouri State (now Missouri State University) in 1966, Bohannon enlisted in the United States Army, serving until 1970. Assigned to the Army Security Agency (ASA), his four years of service included a tour of duty (April 1967 to April 1968) during the Vietnam War with the 199th Infantry Brigade. During the Tet Offensive in early 1968, Bohannon was at Long Binh serving with the 303rd ASA Battalion as part of the II Field Force headquarters. After completion of his Vietnam tour Bohannon was assigned to the Washington D.C. area until discharged in 1970.

===Broadcasting===
After his discharge from the U.S. Army, Bohannon remained in Washington D.C. where he worked in a series of radio jobs throughout the 1970s. They included stints at news stations WTOP and WRC as well as easy listening station WGAY. In 1980, he returned closer to his Midwestern roots as he took a job at WCFL, Chicago. While doing morning drive at WCFL he also landed a second job in the afternoons as a Chicago bureau reporter for the young upstart CNN. Beginning in 1981, through the Mutual Broadcasting System&#x27;s ownership of WCFL, Bohannon became the primary guest host on &quot;The Larry King Show&quot;. Bohannon rapidly gained his own audience as King&#x27;s fill-in and in 1984, Mutual gave him his own Saturday late night call-in program with the format identical to King&#x27;s show. In 1993, &quot;The Larry King Show&quot; moved to afternoons, and Westwood One/Mutual gave King&#x27;s former late evening/overnight time slot to Bohannon.

&quot;The Jim Bohannon Show&quot; moved to Larry King&#x27;s former overnight time slot on January 29, 1993, one day short of the fifteenth anniversary of King&#x27;s 1978 debut on Mutual. Like King&#x27;s late night show, Bohannon&#x27;s program was an immediate ratings success. Broadcasting from Washington, D.C., WFED (as successor to the now-defunct &quot;Washington Post Radio&quot;) was his flagship station, with over 350 affiliates nationwide. Bohannon&#x27;s political views, as stated on air, lean toward being moderate and/or slightly conservative, something he called being a &quot;militant moderate&quot;. In 2003, he stated that:


Bohannon has stated that he was a registered Democrat for the purposes of voting in primary elections. The show aired Monday through Friday from 10:00 PM to 1:00 AM Eastern Time (02:00 to 05:00 UTC during daylight saving time, 03:00 to 06:00 UTC during standard time). Each segment of the show featured guests for interviews and calls from listeners. His show usually dealt with politics and popular culture. When Bohannon was away, guest hosts have historically varied in nature and political views greatly; past substitute hosts include conservative talk host and comedian Dennis Miller, liberal television commentator and talk-radio host Leslie Marshall, and the late comedian Joan Rivers.

Bohannon also hosted a daily Westwood One radio feature called &quot;The Offbeat,&quot; which aired as a part of both &quot;The Jim Bohannon Show&quot; (as its final segment) and &quot;America in The Morning&quot; (near the end of the first half-hour). On December 18, 2015, Bohannon stepped down from &quot;America in the Morning&quot;, after hosting the show for 31 years. Westwood One has appointed radio newsman John Trout to continue the one-hour show, broadcast weekdays at 5 a.m. Eastern Time. Bohannon&#x27;s other broadcasting industry work included occasionally serving as a booth announcer for CBS-TV&#x27;s &quot;Face the Nation&quot;. He has also done voice announcements for the satellite feeds of some other Westwood One radio programs. Bohannon was the originator and driving force behind the National Freedom of Information Day. First submitted by Bohannon to the Society of Professional Journalists in 1979, the event is celebrated each March 16 to honor the birthday of President James Madison, father of the Bill of Rights.

During the summer of 2022, Bohannon was off the air due to unnamed health reasons. On October 10, 2022, Bohannon announced his retirement from the &quot;Jim Bohannon Show&quot;. His final episode was broadcast four days later on October 14, 2022, during which he revealed that he had been diagnosed with stage 4 terminal cancer. His talk show resumed broadcasts the following Monday with Rich Valdés as host, airing as &quot;The Jim Bohannon Show with Rich Valdés&quot; until January 2023, when it was renamed &quot;Rich Valdés America at Night&quot;.

==Personal life==

Jim married his first wife, Mary Camille Skora (who generally went by &quot;Camille&quot;), in late 1970. In 1976 the two began hosting the morning program at Washington, D.C.&#x27;s WTOP radio. However, the station owner did not want the show to be labeled as a &quot;husband and wife team&quot;, so Camille had to adopt the pseudonym of &quot;Laura Walters&quot;. The next year the two moved to middays at WRC, now as &quot;The Bohannons&quot;. In 1980, the pair left the Washington area to work mornings at station WCFL in Chicago. At the time of the move, Camille was quoted as saying: &quot;People ask how we can be together so much, but my answer is that we&#x27;re making up for the first five years when I was a DJ at night and Jim did news during the day and we never saw each other.&quot; However, the couple eventually divorced. Camille went on to become a noted broadcaster, with a long career at the Associated Press and United Press International. 

Bohannon and his second wife Annabelle attended high school together but lost touch after graduation. Said Bohannon of her, &quot;I just worshipped her in high school, but she dated the football captain and I didn&#x27;t make any time with her.&quot; Thirty-three years later they got reacquainted at a book signing in Columbia, Missouri, and were married on August 21, 1998.

As hobbies he enjoyed reading science fiction, playing tennis and the trombone, something he had done since high school. He was a staunch supporter of the Jerry Hoover scholarship at Lebanon High School, serving as its honorary chairman. The scholarship is named in honor of Bohannon&#x27;s former band director and is awarded to a student who will be attending Missouri State University and participating in the instrumental music program. Bohannon also did much work with the Smithsonian Associates. He remained close to his Missouri roots however, often mentioning his hometown of Lebanon, the trout fishing at nearby Bennett Spring State Park, and even once broadcasting an entire week of his shows from the Ozark Empire Fairgrounds in Springfield. The Bohannons resided in the Washington D.C. suburb of Montgomery Village, Maryland.

In an October 2022 interview, Bohannon stated he had terminal esophageal cancer, with only a 50 percent chance of surviving the remainder of the year. He died in Seneca, South Carolina, on November 12, 2022, at the age of 78.

<text>The Pung cholom () is a traditional Meitei dance form originated from Manipur, which is the soul of the Manipuri Sankirtana music and the Manipuri classical dance. The Pung cholom is a unique classical dance of Manipur. This dance may be performed by men or women and is usually a prelude to the Ras Lila. 
In this style, the dancers play the pung (a form of hand beaten drum) while they dance at the same time. Dancers need to be graceful and acrobatic at the same time. They use these acrobatic effects without breaking the rhythm or flow of music. The dance is marked by a gentle rhythm, which gradually builds up to a thunderous climax. Pung cholom borrows elements from the Manipuri martial arts, Thang Ta and Sarit Sarak and also from the traditional &quot;Maibi Jagoi&quot;.

== Function of eyes ==
In Pung Cholom, eyes play a crucial role since every actions are done through vision.
There are three different ways of directing the gaze: close , or to about 2.6m from the performer, middle , about 4.3m, and distant , about 6m.

<doc id="730104" wikidata="Q1452610" url="?curid=730104" title="Freddie Redd">
<text>Freddie Redd (May 29, 1928 – March 17, 2021) was an American hard-bop pianist and composer. He is best known for writing music to accompany &quot;The Connection&quot; (1959), a play by Jack Gelber. According to Peter Watrous, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Mr. Redd hung out at jam sessions in the 1950s and played with many of the major figures, Sonny Rollins to Art Blakey, and worked regularly with Charles Mingus. When things got tough, he just moved on, living in Guadalajara, Mexico, and in Paris and London.&quot;

==Biography==
An autodidact, he began playing the piano at a young age and took to studying jazz seriously when he was 18, after a friend played him a record of &quot;Shaw &#x27;Nuff&quot; by Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie during his military service in Korea (1946–1949).

Redd&#x27;s most successful project was in the late 1950s when he was invited to compose the music for The Living Theatre&#x27;s New York stage production of &quot;The Connection&quot;, which was also used in the subsequent 1961 film. In both play and film he performed as an actor and musician. The theater production was a modest hit and the troupe toured the United States and Europe, performing in New York City, London, and Paris. Redd also led a Blue Note album of his music for the play, featuring on alto sax Jackie McLean, who had also appeared in the play. Redd&#x27;s success in the theater production, however, did not advance his career in the United States, and shortly afterwards he moved to Europe, spending time in Denmark and France.

== Personal life ==
Redd was born to Freddie Redd and Helen (Snipes) Redd. Redd was born and grew up in New York City; he was raised by his mother, who moved around Harlem, Brooklyn and other neighborhoods. His father was a porter and played piano while his mother was a homemaker. Redd lost his father when he was two. Using the piano his father left behind when he died, Redd taught himself how to play. He learned how to play the piano when he was 18.

His late wife, Valarie Lyons Redd, died along with his children, Stephanie Redd and Freddie Redd III. His current family consists of his grandson, Leslie Clarke, a stepdaughter, Susan Redd, and two other grandchildren as well as two step-grandchildren.

After leaving high school, Redd enlisted in the Army in 1946, where he was introduced to bebop. This is where he spent the next three years learning more about the piano and playing gigs with his friends throughout bases and camps within South Korea. There were pianos in every recreation room, which is where Redd taught himself how to play and formed a band during his time of service. After three years of being in the army, he left and was set on becoming a jazz musician. Redd was passionate about practicing and listened to many of his inspirations, such as Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, and Thelonious Monk.

Redd was passionate about moving around and enjoyed the lifestyle of traveling to new places. In the 60s, Redd spent time traveling to various regions such as Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Paris, London, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Guadalajara, Baltimore, and Carrboro. Redd mentioned that the main reason as to why he lived in various countries in Europe was due to the environment and how they accepted artists. The main drive for Redd moving to Europe in the 60s and 70s was because of the many opportunities it provided him. Redd lived in Los Angeles in the late 70s, where he recorded &quot;Straight Ahead.&quot; It was not until he reached his 80s that he returned home to New York to continue recording albums.

It was revealed that Redd did not begin working towards his goal in music until he hit the age of seventeen, however, he always had an interest in music ever since he started watching Salvation Army bands as a kid.

== Career ==
Redd returned to New York in 1949 after his enlistment ended, where he played with various artists such as Gene Ammons, Sonny Rollins, and Art Farmer. Upon discharge, he worked with drummer Johnny Mills, and then in New York played with Tiny Grimes, Cootie Williams, Oscar Pettiford and the Jive Bombers. In 1954, he played with Art Blakey. Redd toured Sweden in 1956 with Ernestine Anderson and Rolf Ericson. This is also where he recorded his first known album, &quot;Freddie Redd Trio&quot;, in 1955. He was the leader of Prestige and toured Sweden in 1956 with Ernestine Anderson and Rolf Ericson. After returning to the U.S., Redd visited San Francisco to work as a house pianist at Bop City and recorded for Riverside. He continued to perform with Charles Mingus soon after.

Redd was convicted of possession of marijuana, resulting in the loss of his cabaret card. This led him to move to Greenwich Village, where he continued with his music career in a loft alongside visual artists and poets since he was not allowed to perform in clubs without his card. Redd also continued to apply to the Greenwich House School of Music before leaving and getting his first professional job at Hy’s in Syracuse. After spending time with people who had creative pursuits, he met Gary Goodrow, who was a known saxophonist and actor who had a role in &quot;The Connection.&quot; He eventually introduced Redd to author Jack Gelber, who played a major role in the creation of his biggest accomplishment from &quot;The Connection.&quot;

Redd originally recorded enough material for an album in 1961, however, the tapes were put away once he had a conflict with one of Blue Note’s founders, Alfred Lion. These tapes were discovered later on and Redd released them in 1988 with his album, &quot;Redd’s Blues.&quot;

During Redd’s time of staying in Europe, he played in various regions. However, within this period, he had only recorded one trio session, named &quot;Under Paris Skies (Future)&quot; in 1971.

Redd struggled to establish himself commercially; however, musically, his creative lines, particular voicings and innovative compositions solidified his reputation; he worked with such musicians as Jackie McLean, Tina Brooks, Paul Chambers, Howard McGhee, Milt Hinton, Lou Donaldson, Benny Bailey, Charles Mingus, Louis Hayes, Al McKibbon, Billy Higgins, Osie Johnson, Tommy Potter, and Joe Chambers, among others. He even contributed organ to James Taylor&#x27;s original 1968 recording of &quot;Carolina in My Mind&quot;. Redd recorded several albums as leader, including two other Blue Note albums (although the last of these was not issued for many years). In 1989, his three Blue Note albums were reissued as &quot;The Complete Blue Note Recordings of Freddie Redd&quot;, the liner notes of which quoted Jackie McLean as saying: &quot;You never know what town you&#x27;ll see [ Freddie ] in. He&#x27;s always been itinerant. Freddie just appears from time to time, like some wonderful spirit.&quot;

He returned to the United States in 1974 and resettled on the West Coast; he became a regular on the San Francisco scene and recorded intermittently until 1990. In 2011, he resettled in Baltimore.

Redd completed a European tour in 2013, and two albums he made that year – &quot;Reminiscing&quot; and (with Butch Warren) &quot;Baltimore Jazz Loft&quot; were issued in February 2021.

== Death ==
Redd died in New York City on March 17, 2021, aged 92. Redd died at a Manhattan care facility. His grandson, Leslie Clarke, announced that Redd had died in his sleep but the reason was not reported.

<text>Memorare (&quot;Remember, O Most Gracious Virgin Mary&quot;) is a Catholic prayer seeking the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary. It first appears as part of a longer 15th-century prayer, &quot;Ad sanctitatis tuae pedes, dulcissima Virgo Maria.&quot; Memorare, from the Latin &quot;Remember,&quot; is frequently misattributed to the 12th-century Cistercian monk Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, apparently due to confusion with its 17th-century popularizer, Father Claude Bernard, who stated that he learned it from his own father.

==Modern version==
The modern version is taken from that indulgenced by Pope Pius IX in 1846, Raccolta, #339 (S. C. Ind., Dec. 11, 1846; S. P. Ap., Sept. 8, 1935) Encr. Ind. #32:
&lt;poem&gt;
Memorare, O piissima Virgo Maria,
a saeculo non esse auditum, quemquam ad tua currentem praesidia,
tua implorantem auxilia, tua petentem suffragia,
esse derelictum.
Ego tali animatus confidentia,
ad te, Virgo Virginum, Mater, curro,
ad te venio, coram te gemens peccator assisto.
Noli, Mater Verbi,
verba mea despicere;
sed audi propitia et exaudi.
Amen.
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, 
that never was it known that anyone who fled to your protection, 
implored your help, or sought your intercession, 
was left unaided. 
Inspired by this confidence, 
I fly unto you, O Virgin of virgins, my Mother. 
To you do I come, before you I stand, sinful and sorrowful. 
O Mother of the Word Incarnate, 
despise not my petitions, 
but in your mercy, hear and answer me.
Amen.
&lt;/poem&gt;
==History of the prayer==
This prayer is originally from a longer prayer of the 15th century, &quot;Ad sanctitatis tuae pedes, dulcissima Virgo Maria&quot;.

===Francis de Sales===
The de Sales family were members of the minor nobility and devout Catholics, but St. Francis de Sales fell victim to the religious turmoil of his age. The question of predestination, the hottest point of contention between Catholic and Calvinist theologians, tormented him while he was a student in Paris. In his distress over the uncertain fate of his soul he cried out to God, &quot;Whatever happens, Lord, may I at least love you in this life if I cannot love you in eternity.&quot; At the age of 18, while studying at the Jesuit run Collège de Clermont at the University of Paris, according to the book &quot;The Spirit of St. Francis de Sales&quot;, by Jean-Pierre Camus:
According to De Sales&#x27; &quot;Selected Letters&quot;, the &quot;torment of despair came to a sudden end&quot; as he knelt in prayer before the statue of Our Lady of Good Deliverance (the Black Madonna) at the church of Saint-Étienne-des-Grès, Paris, saying the Memorare. Francis credited the Blessed Virgin with &quot;saving him from falling into despair or heresy&quot;; he &quot;recited the Memorare day after day&quot;, and she &quot;did not leave him unaided.&quot;

===Claude Bernard===
It was popularized in the 17th century by Fr. Claude Bernard (d. 1641), who learned it from his father. Bernard&#x27;s devotion to Our Lady under the title &quot;Consolatrix Afflictorum&quot; (Comforter of the Afflicted) led him to promote recourse to her intercession among the poor and condemned prisoners. According to the book &quot;Familiar Prayers: Their Origin and History&quot; written by Fr. Herbert Thurston S.J. in 1953:

The &quot;Memorare&quot; played a part in the conversion of Marie-Alphonse Ratisbonne, when upon the dare of a Catholic acquaintance he agreed to wear the Miraculous Medal and recite the prayer for a month.

The prayer became popular in England by way of France, and appeared in the 1856 edition of Bishop Richard Challoner&#x27;s &quot;The Garden of the Soul&quot;. In a 1918 article published in the &quot;Month&quot; on the theme of &quot;Familiar Prayers&quot;, Herbert Thurston discussed the &quot;Memorare&quot; as one of the prayers he considered representative of English Catholic prayer. By &quot;familiar&quot;, Thurston meant those prayers most of the faithful knew by heart. There were at least five separate versions circulating at that time. Mary Heinman observes that the &quot;Memorare&quot; &quot;...became an English Catholic favorite in the post-1850 period for reasons which had no direct connection to either papal directives or native tradition.&quot;

William Fitzgerald notes, &quot;Calling on Mary to &#x27;remember&#x27; is an act of boldness, but it is boldness justified by tradition...Mary needs no reminder of her role in the realm of salvation. However, those who call upon her do require such reminders (if not specifically, then more generally) to remind them of their place as supplicants before the Virgin Mary.&quot; Asking Mary to intercede as our Advocate before God does not guarantee that a supplicant&#x27;s specific request will be granted, only that divine aid and assistance in the supplicant&#x27;s best interest will be given through Mary&#x27;s help.

==Indulgence==
In the Roman Catholic Church, the &quot;Enchiridion Indulgentiarum&quot; of 2004 provides for partial indulgence for devoutly reciting the prayer under the normal conditions.

<doc id="730109" wikidata="Q37217" url="?curid=730109" title="Fyodor Tyutchev">
<text>Fyodor Ivanovich Tyutchev (, ; – ) was a Russian poet and diplomat.

==Ancestry==
Tyutchev was born into an old Russian noble family in the Ovstug family estate near Bryansk (modern-day Zhukovsky District, Bryansk Oblast of Russia). His father Ivan Nikolaevich Tyutchev (1768—1846) was a court councillor who served in the Kremlin Expedition that managed all building and restoration works of Moscow palaces. One of Ivan&#x27;s sisters, Princess Yevdokia Nikolaevna Meshcherskaya (1774—1837), was a hegumenia famous for founding the Borisoglebsky Anosin Women&#x27;s Monastery. The Tyutchevs traced their roots to Zakhariy Tutchev mentioned in &quot;The Tale of the Rout of Mamai&quot;, a 15th-century epic tale about the Battle of Kulikovo that described him as the most trusted man of Dmitry Donskoy; sent as a messenger to Mamai, he managed to reveal traitors and return alive thanks to his diplomatic skills. Fyodor&#x27;s mother Countess Ekaterina Lvovna Tolstaya (1776—1866) belonged to the Tolstoy family on her father&#x27;s side and the Rimsky-Korsakov noble house on her mother&#x27;s side. Russian war general Alexander Rimsky-Korsakov was her uncle.

==Biography==
Most of his childhood years were spent in Moscow, where he joined the literary circle of Professor Merzlyakov at the age of 13. His first printed work was a translation of Horace&#x27;s epistle to Maecenas, published when he was still 15. From that time on, his poetic language was distinguished from that of Pushkin and other contemporaries by its liberal use of majestic, solemn Slavonic archaisms.

His family tutor was Semyon Raich, a minor poet and translator under whose guidance Tyutchev undertook his first poetic steps. From 1819 to 1821 Tyutchev studied at the Philological Faculty of Moscow University. After graduating he joined the Foreign Office and in 1822 accompanied his relative, Count Ostermann-Tolstoy, to Munich to take up a post as trainee diplomat at the Russian legation. He was to remain abroad for 22 years.

In Munich he fell in love with Amalie von Lerchenfeld, the illegitimate half-sister of a young Bavarian diplomat, Count Maximilian Joseph von Lerchenfeld. Tyutchev&#x27;s poem &quot;Tears&quot; or &quot;Slyozy&quot; (&quot;Liubliu, druz&#x27;ya, laskat&#x27; ochami...&quot;) coincides with one of their meetings, and is most likely dedicated to Amalie (or Amélie, as she was usually known). Among other poems inspired by her are &quot;K. N.&quot;, and &quot;Ia pomniu vremia zolotoe…&quot; Published extracts from the letters and diaries of Maximilian von Lerchenfeld illuminate the first years of Tyutchev as a diplomat in Munich (1822–1826), giving details of his frustrated love affair for Amélie, nearly involving a duel (probably with his colleague, Baron Alexander von Krüdener), in January 1825. Amélie was coerced by her relatives into marrying the much older Krüdener, but she and Tyutchev continued to be friends and frequented the same diplomatic society in Munich. A late poem of 1870 with the title &quot;K.B.&quot; (&quot;Ia vstretil vas — i vsio biloe&quot;), long accepted on dubious evidence as addressed to Amélie, is now thought much more likely to refer to Tyutchev&#x27;s sister-in-law Clotilde (or Klothilde) von Bothmer. Tyutchev&#x27;s last meeting with Amélie took place on March 31, 1873 (OS) when she visited him on his deathbed. The next day, Tyutchev wrote to his daughter Daria: 

Yesterday I felt a moment of burning emotion due to my meeting with... my dear Amalie Krüdener who wished to see me for the last time in this world and came to take her leave of me. In her person my past and the best years of my life came to give me a farewell kiss.
In Munich, he came under the influence of the German Romantic movement, and this is reflected in his poetry. Among the figures, he knew personally were the poet Heinrich Heine and the philosopher Friedrich Schelling. In 1826, he married Eleonore Peterson, née Countess von Bothmer, the Bavarian widow of a Russian diplomat, secretary of the Russian mission in Munich, Alexander Khristoforovich Peterson (1759-1825). She became the mother of his daughter Anna Tyutcheva. Following her death in 1838, Tyutchev married another aristocratic young German widow, Baroness Ernestine von Dörnberg, née von Pfeffel, who had become his mistress and had a child by him while Eleonore was still alive. Neither of his wives understood Russian to begin with (Ernestine made efforts to learn the language only much later). That is hardly surprising since Tyutchev spoke French better than Russian and nearly all his private correspondence was in the former language. 
In 1836, a young former colleague at the Munich legation, Prince Ivan Gagarin, obtained Tyutchev&#x27;s permission to publish his selected poems in &quot;Sovremennik&quot;, a literary journal edited by Pushkin. Although appreciated by the great Russian poet, the superb lyrics failed to spark off any public interest. The death of Eleonore in 1838 hit Tyutchev hard and appears to have silenced him as a poet for some considerable time, and for ten years afterwards, he wrote hardly any lyric verse. Instead, he turned his attention to publishing political articles in Western periodicals such as the &quot;Revue des Deux Mondes&quot; outlining his strongly held views on Russia&#x27;s role in the world (see below).

In 1837, Tyutchev was transferred from Munich to the Russian legation in Turin. He found his new place of residence uncongenial to his disposition and after marrying Ernestine, he resigned from his position there to settle in Munich. It was later discovered that Tyutchev had actually abandoned his post as chargé d&#x27;affaires in Turin without official permission to marry in Switzerland, and he was dismissed from the Foreign Service as a result. He continued to live in Germany for five more years without position before returning to Russia. Upon his eventual return to St Petersburg in 1844, the poet was much lionised in the highest society. His daughter Kitty caused a sensation, and the novelist Leo Tolstoy wooed her, &quot;almost prepared to marry her impassively, without love, but she received me with studied coldness&quot;, as he remarked in a diary. Kitty would later become influential at Konstantin Pobedonostsev&#x27;s circle at the Russian court. Not long after his return to Russia, Tyutchev was reinstated in government service as a censor, rising eventually to become Chairman of the Foreign Censorship Committee and a Privy Councillor.

Tyutchev loved to travel, often volunteering for diplomatic courier missions as a way of combining business with pleasure. One of his lengthiest and most significant missions was to newly independent Greece in the autumn of 1833. During his years abroad there were visits home on leave, and after settling in Russia in 1844, he would sometimes spend short periods on the family estate at Ovstug. Tours undertaken in a private capacity took him to many parts of continental Europe, including Italy, France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. He was particularly drawn to the Swiss lakes and mountains. Many of his best poems were inspired by such journeys.

As a poet, Tyutchev was little known during his lifetime. His 400 or so short poems were the only pieces he ever wrote in Russian. Tyutchev regarded his poems as &quot;bagatelles&quot;, not worthy of publication. He generally did not care to write them down and, if he did, he would often lose papers they were scribbled upon. Nikolay Nekrasov, when listing Russian poets in 1850, praised Tyutchev as one of the most talented among &quot;minor poets&quot;. It was only in 1854 that his first volume of verse was printed, which was prepared by Ivan Turgenev and others without any help from the author.

In 1850, he began an illicit affair with Elena Denisyeva, over twenty years his junior. She remained his mistress until her death from tuberculosis in 1864; they had three children. The affair produced a body of lyrics rightly considered among the finest love poems in the language. Permeated with a sublime feeling of subdued despair, the so-called &quot;Denisyeva Cycle&quot; has been variously described by critics as &quot;a novel in verse&quot;, &quot;a human document, shattering in the force of its emotion&quot;, and &quot;a few songs without comparison in Russian, perhaps even in world poetry&quot;. One of the poems, &quot;Last Love&quot;, is often cited as emblematic of the whole cycle.

In the early 1870s, the deaths of his brother, son and daughter left Tyutchev deeply depressed. (Depression was something from which he suffered at intervals throughout his life.) Following a series of strokes, he died in Tsarskoye Selo in 1873 and was interred at Novodevichy Monastery in St. Petersburg. Ernestine survived him by 21 years.

==Political views==

Tyutchev was a militant Pan-Slavist, who never needed a particular reason to berate the Western powers, Vatican, Ottoman Empire or Poland, the latter perceived by him as a Judas in the Slavic fold. The failure of the Crimean War made him look critically at the Russian government as well.

On domestic matters, he held broadly liberal views. He warmly welcomed most of the reforms of Tsar Alexander II, particularly the Emancipation Reform of 1861. Both in his work as a censor and in his writings, he promoted the ideal of freedom of expression, frequently incurring the wrath of his superiors as a result, even under the more relaxed regime of Alexander II.

His fairly sizeable output of verse on political subjects is largely forgotten. One exception is a short poem which has become something of a popular maxim in Russia: 
== Poetry ==

Tyutchev is one of the most memorized and quoted Russian poets. Occasional pieces, translations and political poems constitute about a half of his overall poetical output.

The 200 or so lyric pieces which represent the core of his poetic genius, whether describing a scene of nature or passions of love, put a premium on metaphysics. Tyutchev&#x27;s world is bipolar -- he commonly operates with such categories as night and day, north and south, dream and reality, cosmos and chaos, still world of winter and spring teeming with life. Each of these images is imbued with specific meaning. Tyutchev&#x27;s idea of night, for example, was defined by critics as &quot;the poetic image often covering economically and simply the vast notions of time and space as they affect man in his struggle through life&quot;. In the chaotic and fathomless world of &quot;night&quot;, &quot;winter&quot;, or &quot;north&quot; man feels himself tragically abandoned and lonely. Hence, a modernist sense of frightening anxiety permeates his poetry. Unsurprisingly, it was not until the late 19th and early 20th century that Tyutchev was rediscovered and hailed as a great poet by the Russian Symbolists such as Vladimir Solovyov, Andrey Bely and Alexander Blok.

== Sample of verse ==

&quot;Silentium!&quot; is an archetypal poem by Tyutchev. Written in 1830, it is remarkable for its rhythm crafted so as to make reading in silence easier than aloud toward others. Like so many of his poems, its images are anthropomorphic and pulsing with pantheism. As one Russian critic put it, &quot;the temporal epochs of human life, its past and its present fluctuate and vacillate in equal measure: the unstoppable current of time erodes the outline of the present.&quot; 

:Speak not, lie hidden, and conceal
:the way you dream, the things you feel.
:Deep in your spirit let them rise
:akin to stars in crystal skies
:that set before the night is blurred:
:delight in them and speak no word.

:How can a heart expression find?
:How should another know your mind?
:Will he discern what quickens you?
:A thought, once uttered, is untrue.
:Dimmed is the fountainhead when stirred:
:drink at the source and speak no word.

:Live in your inner self alone
:within your soul a world has grown,
:the magic of veiled thoughts that might
:be blinded by the outer light,
:drowned in the noise of day, unheard...
:take in their song and speak no word. 
:::::::::::(trans. by Vladimir Nabokov

== In Classical Music ==

Incidentally, this poem inspired an early-20th-century composer, Georgi Catoire (the setting of the poem in the song &quot;Silentium&quot;), while another one of Tyutchev&#x27;s poems, &quot;O chem ty voesh&#x27; vetr nochnoy...&quot;, was the inspiration for Nikolai Medtner&#x27;s &quot;Night Wind&quot; piano sonata (#7) of 1911. There is a well-known setting by Rakhmaninov of Tyutchev&#x27;s poem &quot;Spring Waters&quot;. While the title of Nikolai Myaskovsky&#x27;s 1910 tone poem, &quot;Silence&quot;, may have been borrowed from Tyutchev, the inspiration is credited to one of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s tales. The same poem was also set to music by the 20th-century Russian composer, Boris Tchaikovsky (1925-1996), in his 1974 cantata &quot;Signs of the Zodiac&quot;. Composer Lyubov Streicher (1888-1958) set Tyutchev’s text to music in her &quot;Romances&quot;. The Ukrainian composer, Valentyn Sylvestrov (born 1937), has made a memorable setting of &#x27;Last Love&#x27;, recorded by Alexi Lubimov and Jana Ivanilova on the album &#x27;Stufen&#x27;. Tyutchev had an affinity with themes of the night and Julian Cochran set two of Tyutchev&#x27;s poems related to the night, &quot;The Night Wind&quot;, and &quot;The Night Sea&quot;, for soprano and piano. At the end of Andrey Tarkovsky&#x27;s film &quot;Stalker&quot;, a character recites a Tyutchev poem.

<doc id="730110" wikidata="Q8514196" url="?curid=730110" title="Breed-specific legislation">
<text>In law, breed-specific legislation (BSL) is a type of law that prohibits or restricts particular breeds or types of dog. Such laws range from outright bans on the possession of these dogs, to restrictions and conditions on ownership, and often establishes a legal presumption that such dogs are dangerous or vicious to prevent dog attacks. Some jurisdictions have enacted breed-specific legislation in response to a number of fatalities or maulings involving pit bull–type dogs or other dog breeds commonly used in dog fighting, and some government organizations such as the United States Army and Marine Corps have taken administrative action as well. Due to opposition to such laws in the United States, anti-BSL laws have been passed in 21 of the 50 state-level governments, prohibiting or restricting the ability of jurisdictions within those states to enact or enforce breed-specific legislation.

==Background==
It is generally settled in case law that jurisdictions in the United States and Canada have the right to enact breed-specific legislation; however, the appropriateness and effectiveness of breed-specific legislation in preventing dog bite fatalities and injuries is disputed. One point of view is that certain dog breeds are a public safety issue that merits actions such as banning ownership, mandatory spaying/neutering for all dogs of these breeds, mandatory microchip implants and liability insurance, or prohibiting people convicted of a felony from owning them. Another point of view is that comprehensive &quot;dog bite&quot; legislation, coupled with better consumer education and legally mandating responsible pet keeping practices, is a better solution than breed-specific legislation to the problem of dangerous dogs.

A third point of view is that breed-specific legislation should not ban breeds entirely, but should strictly regulate the conditions under which specific breeds could be owned, e.g., forbidding certain classes of individuals from owning them, specifying public areas in which they would be prohibited, and establishing conditions, such as requiring a dog to wear a muzzle, for taking dogs from specific breeds into public places. Finally, some governments, such as that of Australia, have forbidden the import of specific breeds and require all existing dogs of these breeds to be spayed/neutered in an attempt to eliminate the population slowly through natural attrition.

Approximately 550 jurisdictions in the United States have enacted breed-specific legislation in response to a number of well-publicized incidents involving pit bull–type dogs, and some government organizations such as the U.S. Army and Marine Corps have taken administrative action as well. These actions range from outright bans on the possession of pit bull–type dogs, to restrictions and conditions on pit bull ownership. They often establish a legal presumption that a pit bull–type dog is &quot;prima facie&quot; a legally &quot;dangerous&quot; or &quot;vicious&quot; dog. In response, 16 states in the U.S. prohibited or restricted the ability of municipal governments within those states to enact BSL, though these restrictions do not affect military installations located within the states.

===Studies===
A study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2000 concluded that fatal attacks on humans appeared to be a breed-specific problem (pit bull–type dogs and Rottweilers accounted for half of all fatal dog attacks on humans between 1979 and 1998). However, they also concluded that fatal attacks represent a small proportion of dog bite injuries to humans and suggested that there may be better alternatives for prevention of dog bites than breed-specific ordinances. Given many media sources reported that this study suggested that pit bull–type dogs and Rottweilers are disproportionately more dangerous than other dog breeds (Fatal dog attacks in USA &amp; Canada 1982 – 2019).The American Veterinary Medical Association, whose journal published the original article, released a statement detailing that this study &quot;cannot be used to infer any breed specific risk for dog bite fatalities&quot; (for lack of sufficient data on total breed ownership).

A 2018 literature review determined that &quot;injuries from Pitbull&#x27;s and mixed breed dogs were both more frequent and more severe.&quot; In a 2019 study of patient records, among several breed categories, &quot;pit bull terriers inflicted more complex wounds, were often unprovoked, and went off property to attack. Other top-biting breeds resulting in more unprovoked and complex wounds included German shepherds, Rottweilers, and huskies.&quot; 

In a 2014 literature review, the American Veterinary Medical Association stated that &quot;controlled studies have not identified this breed group as disproportionately dangerous&quot;, and that &quot;it has not been demonstrated that introducing a breed-specific ban will reduce the rate or severity of bite injuries occurring in the community&quot;. In 2012, the American Bar Association passed a resolution urging the repeal of breed-specific legislation, stating that it is &quot;ineffective at improving public safety&quot;. In 2013, researchers in Canada found no difference in incidence of dog bites between municipalities with breed-specific legislation and those without it, and in 2008, the Dutch government repealed a 15 year ban on pit bulls, concluding the law was ineffective.

A 2017 study examining dog-bite characteristics in Ireland has suggested that targeting specific dog breeds can have significant negative outcomes. The study found that no significant difference existed between legislated and non-legislated dog breeds for the type of bite inflicted, and the medical treatment needed after the bite. The authors found that non-legislated dog breeds were less likely to be reported to the authorities both before and after the bite compared to legislated dog breeds. The publication suggests there is no scientifically valid basis for breed-specific legislation, and suggests significant negative consequences may result from its introduction.

==Legislation==

Fifty-two countries have some form of breed-specific legislation, and 41 of those have BSL at the national level, as of December 2018.

===North America===
====Bermuda====
In Bermuda, since, July 21, 2003, importing or breeding of any &quot;breed of dog that may be perceived as dangerous&quot; is prohibited. Prohibited breeds include: American Pit Bull Terrier, American Bulldog, American Staffordshire Terrier, Dogo Argentino, Boerboel, Fila Brasiliero, Cane Corso, Presa Canario, Neapolitan Mastiff, Tosa Inu, Wolf or Wolf hybrid, and crossbreeds thereof, as well as &quot;any exotic or uncommon breed&quot; at the government&#x27;s discretion.

Another category, restricted breeds, may be imported/kept once the conditions for keeping these dogs have been fulfilled, new acquisitions require pre-approval, and they may be bred only with a Breeder’s permit. Restricted breeds include: Akita, Australian Cattle Dog, Belgian Malinois, Bouvier Des Flandres, Bull Terrier, Bullmastiff, Chow Chow, Doberman Pinscher, Dogue De Bordeaux, German Shepherd, English Mastiff, Rhodesian Ridgeback, Rottweiler, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and any cross of these.

====Canada====

The Canadian federal government does not regulate pit bull–type dogs, but two provincial governments and some municipal governments in Canada have enacted breed-specific legislation banning or restricting pit bull–type dogs. The following table discusses a sampling of the restrictions in force.

====United States====
As of 2018 there is some level of breed-specific legislation in 37 states and over 1,000 cities. Though the Federal Government of the United States has not enacted breed-specific legislation, four of the five branches of the United States Armed Forces have restricted certain breeds at almost 300 installations (mostly with respect to on-base housing and privatized housing). Over 20 American Indian Reservations have also enacted BSL.

The following 17 states prohibit their municipalities from passing breed-specific laws: Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, Massachusetts, Nevada, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Utah and South Dakota. California prohibits most breed-specific laws, but allows breed-specific spay/neuter.

There have been at least 60 municipality BSL repeals in the U.S. since 2018.

As of 2021, there are only 9 states that prohibit local governments from implementing or enforcing breed-specific legislation. They include: Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Washington DC

Below are summaries of some of the breed-specific legislation enacted in the United States. This is &quot;not&quot; an all-inclusive list of BSL throughout the USA.

===Central and South America===

===Europe===

====Republic of Ireland====
The &quot;Control of Dogs Regulations, 1998&quot; place controls on 12 breeds of dogs: American Pit Bull Terrier, English Bull Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Dogo Argentino, Bull Mastiff, Doberman Pinscher, German Shepherd (Alsatian), Rhodesian Ridgeback, Rottweiler, Japanese Akita, Japanese Tosa, and Bandog. These dogs, or strains and crosses thereof, must be kept on a strong, short lead (less than 2 metres / 6′ 7″) by a person over 16 years of age who is capable of controlling them. The dogs must be securely muzzled and wear a collar with the name and address of the owner.

====United Kingdom====

In the United Kingdom the main piece of breed-specific legislation is the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, which makes it illegal to own any &#x27;Specially Controlled Dogs&#x27; without specific exemption from a court. The dogs have to be muzzled and kept on a lead in public, they must be registered and insured, neutered, tattooed and receive microchip implants. The Act also bans the breeding, sale and exchange of these dogs, even if they are on the &#x27;Index of Exempted Dogs&#x27;.

Two types of dogs are specifically identified by the Act:

* Pit Bull Terrier
* Japanese Tosa

In addition, the Dangerous Dogs (Designated Types) Order 1991, a statutory instrument made under this Act, designated two more types as &quot;appearing to be bred for fighting or to have the characteristics of types bred for that purpose&quot;:
* Dogo Argentino
* Fila Brasileiro
The “Dangerous Dogs (Designated Types) (England and Wales) Order 2023” and “The Dangerous Dogs (Designated Types) Order (Northern Ireland) 2024”, as well as “The Dangerous Dogs (Designated Types) (Scotland) Order 2024” designated one more type as “appearing to be bred for fighting or to have the characteristics of a type bred for that purpose”:
* American Bully XL, also referred to as XL Bully 

The Act also covers cross-breeds of the above five types of dog. Dangerous dogs are classified by &quot;type&quot;, not by breed label. This means that whether a dog is prohibited under the Act will depend on a judgement about its physical characteristics, and whether they match the description of a prohibited &quot;type&quot;. This assessment of the physical characteristics is made by a court.

The Act applies in England, Wales and Scotland, with the Dangerous Dogs (Northern Ireland) Orders of 1991 and 2024 having a similar effect in Northern Ireland.

==Opposition==

===Legal challenges, Ontario 2007-2009===
In &quot;Cochrane v. Ontario (Attorney General)&quot;, 2007 CanLII 9231 (ON S.C.), Ms. Catherine Cochrane sued the Province of Ontario to prevent it from enforcing the Dog Owner&#x27;s Liability Act (DOLA) ban on pit bull–type dogs, arguing that the law was unconstitutionally broad because the ban was grossly disproportionate to the risk pit bulls pose to public safety, and that the law was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to provide an intelligible definition of pit bulls. She also argued that a provision allowing the Crown to introduce as evidence a veterinarian&#x27;s certificate certifying that the dog is a pit bull violates the right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence.

The presiding judge ruled that the DOLA was not overbroad because,
&quot;The evidence with respect to the dangerousness of pit bulls, although conflicting and inconclusive, is sufficient, in my opinion, to constitute a &#x27;reasoned apprehension of harm&#x27;. In the face of conflicting evidence as to the feasibility of less restrictive means to protect the public, it was open to the legislature to decide to restrict the ownership of all pit bulls.&quot;

The presiding judge found the term &quot;a pit bull terrier&quot; was unconstitutionally vague since it could include an undefined number of dogs similar to the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, and Staffordshire Bull Terrier. The judge also ruled that the government&#x27;s ability to introduce a veterinarian&#x27;s certificate certifying that the dog is a pit bull created a mandatory presumption that the dog was a pit bull, and that this placed an unconstitutional burden of proof upon the defendant.

In 2008, both Ms. Cochrane and the Attorney General of Ontario appealed different aspects of the decision to the Court of Appeal for Ontario.
In &quot;Cochrane v. Ontario&quot; (2008 ONCA 718), the Court of Appeal reversed the lower court&#x27;s ruling:
* It agreed with the lower court judge in finding that the &quot;overbreadth&quot; claim failed because the legislature had acted on a &quot;reasonable apprehension of harm&quot;.
* It disagreed that the definition of pit bull in the Act was insufficiently precise and restored the original wording of &quot;pit bull terrier&quot; on the basis that, when read in the context of &quot;a more comprehensive definition&quot;, the phrasing &quot;a pit bull terrier&quot; was sufficiently precise.
* It reversed the trial court and found that the government&#x27;s ability to introduce a veterinarian&#x27;s certificate certifying a dog was a pit bull would constitute proof only if the defendant failed to answer the claim: it was therefore a tactical burden, rather an evidentiary burden.

On June 11, 2009 the Supreme Court of Canada declined to hear further appeal of the case, thereby upholding the Ontario ban on pit bulls.

===Legal challenges, USA===
Court challenges to breed-specific legislation on constitutional grounds have been largely unsuccessful. Dana M. Campbell summarized the legal challenges and the general court findings as of July 2009:
Court cases challenging BSL have focused on constitutional concerns such as substantive due process, equal protection, and vagueness. Most BSL will survive the minimum scrutiny analysis allowed by the due process clauses of the Constitution&#x27;s Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments because there is no fundamental right at issue. This analysis requires that the law being challenged must be rationally related to a legitimate government goal or purpose. Because state and local jurisdictions enjoy broad police powers, including protecting the public&#x27;s safety and welfare, courts have not had trouble finding that BSL is rationally related to the goal of protecting the public from allegedly dangerous breeds.

This has caused big problems for many who use them as police, guide or other service dogs, as they are not always excluded, and in some cases are confiscated and put down.

Challenges based on equal protection arguments are similarly difficult to sustain. Here courts are looking at whether there is a rational purpose for treating pit bull breeds differently from other dog breeds. Dog owners have attacked the rational purpose requirement by arguing either that BSL is over-inclusive, because it bans all dogs of a breed when only certain individuals within the breed have proven to be vicious, or under-inclusive, because many types of dogs have injured people and the BSL fails to include those other breeds. However, again under minimum scrutiny review, BSL will survive as long as the government can establish that the BSL is rationally related to its purpose, even if the law is found to be over-inclusive or under-inclusive.

Claims that BSL is unconstitutionally vague have brought dog owners mixed success. Procedural due process requires that laws provide the public with sufficient notice of the activity or conduct being regulated or banned. Here owners of pit bulls or other banned breeds argue that the breed ban laws do not adequately define just what is a &quot;pit bull&quot; (or other banned breed) for purposes of the ban. Another argument is that the laws are too vague to help the dog-owning public or the BSL enforcement agency—such as animal control or police—to be able to identify whether a dog falls under the BSL if the dog was adopted with an unknown origin or is a mixed breed.

=====&quot;Sentell v. New Orleans and Carrollton Railroad Company&quot;=====
In &quot;Sentell v. New Orleans and Carrollton Railroad Company&quot;, 166 U.S. 698 (1897), Mr. Sentell sued the New Orleans and Carrollton Railroad Company to recover the value of his female Newfoundland dog that he alleged to have been negligently killed by the railroad company. The company claimed that Louisiana law held that only people who licensed their dogs were entitled to sue for compensation if the dog were killed, and that Mr. Sentell was not entitled to damages since he had not licensed his dog. The trial court in Orleans Parish found for Mr. Sentell and awarded him $250 US, so the railroad company appealed to the Louisiana Court of Appeal, which reversed the decision of the trial court. The Louisiana Supreme Court declined to hear the case, so Mr. Sentell then appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which agreed to hear the case.

The Supreme Court ruled against Mr. Sentell and established the precedent in U.S. jurisprudence that the regulation of dogs was within the police power of the state, and that the dogs were not as valuable as horses, cattle, sheep, or other domesticated animals:It is true that under the Fourteenth Amendment, no state can deprive a person of his life, liberty, or property without due process of law, but in determining what is due process of law, we are bound to consider the nature of the property, the necessity for its sacrifice, and the extent to which it has heretofore been regarded as within the police power. So far as property is inoffensive or harmless, it can only be condemned or destroyed by legal proceedings, with due notice to the owner; but, so far as it is dangerous to the safety or health of the community, due process of law may authorize its summary destruction...

Although dogs are ordinarily harmless, they preserve some of their hereditary wolfish instincts, which occasionally break forth in the destruction of sheep and other helpless animals. Others, too small to attack these animals, are simply vicious, noisy, and pestilent. As their depredations are often committed at night, it is usually impossible to identify the dog or to fix the liability upon the owner, who, moreover, is likely to be pecuniarily irresponsible [not responsible for financial compensation]. In short, the damages are usually such as are beyond the reach of judicial process, and legislation of a drastic nature is necessary to protect persons and property from destruction and annoyance. Such legislation is clearly within the police power of the state. It ordinarily takes the form of a license tax, and the identification of the dog by a collar and tag, upon which the name of the owner is sometimes required to be engraved, but other remedies are not uncommon.

=====&quot;Vanater v. Village of South Point&quot;=====

In &quot;Vanater v. Village of South Point&quot;, 717 F. Supp. 1236 (D. Ohio 1989), the Ohio federal district court held that the criminal ordinance of South Point, Ohio, prohibiting the owning or harboring of pit bull terriers within the village limits was not overly broad, concluding:

The Court concludes that the definitions of a Pit Bull Terrier in this Ordinance are not unconstitutionally vague. An ordinary person could easily refer to a dictionary, a dog buyer&#x27;s guide or any dog book for guidance and instruction; also, the American Kennel Club and United Kennel Club have set forth standards for Staffordshire Bull Terriers and American Staffordshire Terriers to help determine whether a dog is described by any one of them. While it may be true that some definitions contain descriptions which lack &quot;mathematical certainty,&quot; such precision and definiteness is not essential to constitutionality.
The court made the following findings of fact when it determined the village showed that pit bull terriers are uniquely dangerous and therefore, are proper subjects of the village&#x27;s police power for the protection of the public&#x27;s health and welfare:

* Pit Bulls ... possess the quality of gameness, which is not a totally clear concept, but which can be described as the propensity to catch and maul an attacked victim unrelentingly until death occurs, or as the continuing tenacity and tendency to attack repeatedly for the purpose of killing. It is clear that the unquantifiable, unpredictable aggressiveness and gameness of Pit Bulls make them uniquely dangerous.
* Pit Bulls have the following distinctive behavioral characteristics: a) grasping strength, b) climbing and hanging ability, c) weight pulling ability, d) a history of frenzy, which is the trait of unusual relentless ferocity or the extreme concentration on fighting and attacking, e) a history of catching, fighting, and killing instinct, f) the ability to be extremely destructive and aggressive, g) highly tolerant of pain, h) great biting strength, i) undying tenacity and courage and they are highly unpredictable.
* While these traits, tendencies or abilities are not unique to Pit Bulls exclusively, Pit Bulls will have these instincts and phenotypical characteristics; most significantly, such characteristics can be latent and may appear without warning or provocation.
* The breeding history of Pit Bulls makes it impossible to rule out a violent propensity for any one dog as gameness and aggressiveness can be hidden for years. Given the Pit Bull&#x27;s genetical physical strengths and abilities, a Pit Bull always poses the possibility of danger; given the Pit Bull&#x27;s breeding history as a fighting dog and the latency of its aggressiveness and gameness, the Pit Bull poses a danger distinct from other breeds of dogs which do not so uniformly share those traits.
* While Pit Bulls are not the only breed of dog which can be dangerous or vicious, it is reasonable to single out the breed to anticipate and avoid the dangerous aggressiveness which may be undetectable in a Pit Bull.

=====&quot;American Dog Owners Ass&#x27;n, Inc. v. Dade County, Fla.&quot;=====
In &quot;American Dog Owners Ass&#x27;n, Inc. v. Dade County, Fla.&quot;, 728 F.Supp. 1533 (S.D.Fla.,1989), dog owners sued in the federal district court of Florida to prevent Dade County from enforcing a pit bull ban, claiming that there is no such thing as a pit bull dog but rather three separate breeds; however, their own expert witnesses repeatedly identified dogs from the three separate breeds as &quot;pit bull dogs&quot; during the trial. The court upheld the Dade County ordinance, concluding:
Based upon the substantial evidence presented at trial, this court finds that Dade County Ordinance No. 89-022 provides sufficient guidance to dog owners, both in its explicit reference to pit bull dogs, and in its definitional section, to enable pit bull owners to determine whether their dogs fall within the proscriptions of the ordinance...Certainly there are some applications of the ordinance which pass constitutional muster. As long as the enactment is not impermissibly vague in all its applications, this court must uphold its constitutionality. Upon consideration of the evidence presented at trial, the pleadings, memoranda, exhibits and arguments of counsel and upon application of the controlling authority, this court finds that plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of proof and that the Court is required to uphold the constitutionality of Dade County Ordinance No. 089-22.

=====&quot;American Canine Federation, v. City of Aurora, CO&quot;=====
In &quot;American Canine Federation and Florence Vianzon v. City of Aurora, Colorado&quot;, 618 F.Supp.2d 1271 (2009), the plaintiffs sued in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado to prevent Aurora, Colorado, from enforcing a pit bull ban on the grounds that the law was unconstitutionally vague, that the law was an abuse of the city&#x27;s police power, and that the ban represented an unconstitutional taking of property. The court rejected each of these claims based on existing legal precedents and upheld the city&#x27;s ordinance.

====State courts====

=====Arkansas=====
In &quot;Holt v. City of Maumelle&quot;, 817 S.W.2d 208 (AR., 1991), Mr. Steele Holt sued the city of Maumelle, Arkansas, in 1988 in an attempt to have its prohibition against pit bulls overturned on the grounds that the ordinance was impermissibly vague, that it was unreasonable to ban pit bull–type dogs, and that the city&#x27;s Board of Directors committed a breach of contract by passing a pit bull ordinance that it had previously agreed to forego; Mr. Holt also asked that the city pay compensatory damages, punitive damages, and his attorney&#x27;s fees. The Pulaski County circuit court made a summary judgment dismissing the suit, and Mr. Holt appealed. In 1991, the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the circuit court&#x27;s decision, finding that the pit bull ordinance was not impermissibly vague, that the restrictions were reasonable, and that any agreement made by the city to limit its own legislative powers was null and void since the city&#x27;s first duty was to protect the public interest.

=====Colorado=====

In &quot;Colorado Dog Fanciers, Inc. v. City and County of Denver&quot;, 820 P.2d 644, Colo., 1991, the Colorado Supreme Court upheld a Denver city ordinance that dog owners had complained was unconstitutional, along the following lines:
* the dog owners claimed the ordinance was fundamentally unfair and therefore violated their right to procedural due process by forcing them to meet the burden of proving their dog was not a pit bull; however, the higher court found the ordinance was not fundamentally unfair provided the city was required to prove that dogs were pit bulls by the civil standard of &quot;preponderance of evidence&quot; rather than the criminal standard of &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;
* the dog owners claimed the ordinance violated substantive due process by creating a legislative presumption that a pit bull owner knowingly and voluntarily possesses a pit bull, and because it allowed the use of non-scientific evidence (&quot;e.g.&quot;, expert opinion) to prove a dog is a pit bull; however, the higher court determined the ordinance preserves substantive due process by providing dog owners with a constitutionally adequate post-impoundment hearing, and reversed the trial court&#x27;s imposition of a pre-impoundment hearing; in addition, the city was not required to prove a dog was a pit bull with mathematical certainty, and could use expert opinion and non-scientific evidence to prove its case in court.
* the dog owners felt the city ordinance treated all pit bulls and substantially similar dogs as inherently dangerous and was, therefore, unconstitutionally overbroad; however, the higher court ruled that outside the limited area of fundamental constitutional rights such as, for example, first amendment rights of speech or association, a statute may not be attacked as overbroad.
* the dog owners felt the term &quot;pit bull&quot; was imprecise and, thus, unconstitutionally vague because the average dog owner is not afforded fair warning of the act prohibited by the ordinance; however, the higher court found the standards for determining whether a dog is a pit bull are readily accessible to dog owners, and because most dog owners are capable of determining the breed or phenotype of their dog, the trial court properly determined that the ordinance provides adequate notice to dog owners and is not unconstitutionally vague.
* the dog owners argued that the ordinance violated the Equal Protection Clause by creating an irrational distinction between one who owns a dog with the physical characteristics of a pit bull and one who owns a dog lacking those characteristics; however, the higher court ruled that there was ample evidence to establish a rational relationship between the city&#x27;s classification of certain dogs as pit bulls and the legitimate governmental purpose of protecting the health and safety of the city&#x27;s residents and dogs, and thus the ordinance did not violate the dog owners&#x27; right to equal protection of the laws.
* the ordinance is an abuse of the city&#x27;s police power and constitutes an unconstitutional taking of private property; however, the higher court noted that, in Colorado, dogs are accorded qualified property status and are, thus, subject to the proper exercise of police power for the protection of the public&#x27;s health, safety, and welfare.
In &quot;City &amp; County of Denver v. State of Colorado&quot;, 04CV3756, Denver challenged a 2004 law passed by the Colorado General Assembly that prohibited breed specific laws on the grounds that the state law violated the city&#x27;s home rule authority in regard to animal control legislation. The Denver District Court Judge ruled in favor of Denver, finding that:
* the State failed to provide any new evidence to undermine the original 1990 trial court&#x27;s decision regarding the differences between pit bulls and other dogs.
* the City had provided new evidence to provide additional support for the original 1990 trial court&#x27;s decision.
* the 2000 CDC study on fatal dog bite attacks was irrelevant to the narrow issues identified in the 1990 trial court&#x27;s decision
* the State of Colorado had failed to meet its burden of proof to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that no rational basis for Denver&#x27;s pit bull ban existed

=====Florida=====
In &quot;State of Florida v. Peters&quot;, 534 So.2d 760 (Fla.App. 3 Dist. 1988), the Florida Third District Court of Appeal reviewed the city of North Miami ordinance regulating the ownership of pit bull dogs within the city limits, and held: (1) the ordinance did not violate the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution since the city&#x27;s action in light of the evidence was neither arbitrary or irrational; (2) the ordinance&#x27;s requirement to obtain liability insurance did not violate due process since the city had the right to regulate dogs under its police powers; (3) the definition of &quot;pit bull&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague, citing substantial precedent that laws requiring &quot;substantial conformance&quot; with a standard are not considered vague; and that mathematical certainty of a dog&#x27;s identity as a pit bull was not required for a legal determination that a dog was in fact a pit bull.

=====Kansas=====
In &quot;Hearn v. City of Overland Park&quot;, 772 P.2d 758 (Kan. 1989), the Supreme Court of Kansas reviewed the ruling of a county court that overturned an ordinance of the city of Overland Park regulating the ownership of pit bull dogs within the city limits, and held: (1) The ordinance is not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad; (2) the ordinance does not violate the due process rights of plaintiffs under the United States and Kansas Constitutions; (3) the ordinance does not violate the equal protection clauses of the United States and Kansas Constitutions; and (4) the district court did not err in dismissing the plaintiffs&#x27; claim for damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1982).

=====Kentucky=====
In &quot;Bess v. Bracken County Fiscal Court&quot;, 210 S.W.3d 177 (Ky.App., 2006), the Kentucky Court of Appeals reviewed a Bracken County ordinance that banned pit bull terriers. The appellants (Mr. Bess and Mr. Poe) had sought a temporary injunction against the ordinance in the Bracken County Circuit Court. The court dismissed the motion on the grounds that the police power of the Fiscal Court allowed it to ban pit bull terriers and seize them without compensation. The appellants appealed on the grounds that:
# that the ordinance is inconsistent with KRS (Kentucky Revised Statutes) Chapter 258 and specifically with the definition of &quot;vicious dog&quot; contained in KRS 258.095;
# that it impermissibly allows the forfeiture of property without compensation;
# that it denies dog owners procedural due process; and
# that it impedes the right of nonresident owners of pit bull terriers to travel through Bracken County.
The Appeals court upheld the Bracken County ordinance, finding that:
# the breed-specific ordinance supplemented, rather than replaced or superseded, the definition of a &quot;vicious dog&quot; in the state statute;
# the banning of pit bull terriers was permissible under the police power, and that property seized under the police power was not subject to compensation;
# dog owners had the right of appeal to the Circuit Court under the ordinance, so the right of due process was preserved; and
# the ordinance did not discriminate against non-resident pit bull owners, and that the appellants had not provided any evidence that traveling with a pet &quot;occupies a position fundamental to the concept of a federal union.&quot;

=====Massachusetts=====
In &quot;American Dog Owners Ass&#x27;n, Inc. v. City of Lynn&quot;, 404 Mass. 73, 533 N.E.2d 642 (Mass.,1989), the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court reviewed a series of ordinances enacted by Lynn, Massachusetts, targeting dogs variously referred to as &quot;American Staffordshire Terrier[s], a/k/a American Pit Bull Terrier[s] or Bull Terrier[s]&quot; (July 1985); &quot;American Staffordshire, Staffordshire Pit Bull Terrier or Bull Terrier, hereinafter referred to as &#x27;Pit Bulls&#x27;&quot; (June 1986); and &quot;&quot;American Staffordshire, Staffordshire Pit Bull Terrier, Bull Terrier or any mixture thereof&quot; (September 1986).

The Supreme Judicial Court determined that the issue was technically moot since each of the ordinances in question had been repealed by passage of a subsequent &quot;pit bull&quot; ordinance in June 1987; however, the court specifically observed (but did not rule) that the 1987 ordinance relied on the &quot;common understanding and usage&quot; of the names of the breeds in question, and warned that 

the Lynn Pit Bull ban ordinance depends for enforcement on the subjective understanding of dog officers of the appearance of an ill-defined &quot;breed,&quot; leaves dog owners to guess at what conduct or dog &quot;look&quot; is prohibited, and requires &quot;proof&quot; of a dog&#x27;s &quot;type&quot; which, unless the dog is registered, may be impossible to furnish. Such a law gives unleashed discretion to the dog officers charged with its enforcement, and clearly relies on their subjective speculation whether a dog&#x27;s physical characteristics make it what is &quot;commonly understood&quot; to be a &quot;Pit Bull.&quot;
As a result of this case, breed-specific legislation in the United States often relies on the published standards of the American Kennel Club and United Kennel Club to clearly identify the characteristics of dogs subject to regulation as &quot;pit bulls.&quot;

=====New Mexico=====
In &quot;Garcia v. Village of Tijeras&quot;, 767 P.2d 355 (1988), the New Mexico Court of Appeals reviewed an ordinance of the Village of Tijeras that banned the ownership or possession of a breed of dog &quot;known as American Pit Bull Terrier&quot;; any dog found in violation of the ordinance after a court hearing would be euthanized. The court held against each of the defendants&#x27; claims and upheld the ordinance on the following grounds:
# The defendants claimed the ordinance violated their due process rights because it was vague in how it defined &quot;pit bull&quot;; however, the ordinance was not vague because vagueness applies in the sense of &quot;to whom does the law apply.&quot; The law was therefore not vague since the defendants knew the ordinance applied to them.
# The defendants claimed the ordinance was not rationally related to the purpose of preventing pit bull attacks because environment and training are more important than genetics in determining how a dog acts; however, the court held there was substantial, credible evidence of breed-specific issues that the Village&#x27;s actions were warranted.
# The defendants claimed that the ordinance violated equal protection rights because it singled out the owners of pit bulls; however, the court ruled that there was substantial, credible evidence that pit bulls posed a special threat to the people of Tijeras and that there were no grounds to overturn the ordinance.
# The defendants claimed the ordinance denied them procedural due process against the loss of property; however, the court ruled that the court hearings specified by the ordinance were sufficient due process to ensure the owners had &quot;the opportunity to be heard and present evidence would occur at a meaningful time, that is, prior to the destruction of the dog.&quot;
# The defendants claimed the ordinance would deprive them of property without compensation; however, the court ruled that well-established precedent did not require compensation for property seized under a city&#x27;s police powers.

=====New York=====

The New York City Housing Authority updated their pet policy in 2010 to exclude dogs over 25 pounds and specifically prohibit Doberman Pinschers, Pit bulls, Rottweilers, and any mixes thereof.

=====Ohio=====
In &quot;Toledo v. Tellings&quot; – Reversed – 871 N.E.2d 1152 (Ohio, 2007), the Ohio Sixth District Court of Appeal struck down a portion of the Toledo, Ohio, municipal code that limited people to owning only one pit bull. The law relied on a state definition of a vicious dog as one that has bitten or killed a human, has killed another dog, or &quot;belongs to a breed that is commonly known as a Pit Bull dog.&quot; The court held that the legislation was void for violation of a Pit Bull owner&#x27;s right to due process since the owner could not appeal a designation of his pet as a vicious dog. The court held that,&quot;Since we conclude that there is no evidence that pit bulls are inherently dangerous or vicious, then the city ordinance limitation on ownership is also arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory.&quot;

The Supreme Court of Ohio reversed the Court of Appeal (&quot;Toledo v. Tellings&quot;, 114 Ohio St.3d 278, 2007-Ohio-3724), and reinstated the Toledo ordinance for the following reasons:

* {¶ 30} The court of appeals found R.C. 955.11 and 955.22 and Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 unconstitutional with respect to procedural due process, substantive due process, and equal protection, and under the void-for-vagueness doctrine. We disagree.
* {¶ 31} First, the court of appeals declared that the laws violated procedural due process pursuant to &quot;State v. Cowan&quot;, 103 Ohio St.3d 144, 2004-Ohio-4777, 814 N.E.2d 846. In &quot;Cowan&quot;, a Portage County deputy dog warden determined two dogs to be vicious following a complaint that the dogs had attacked a woman. Id. at ¶ 1. The dogs were determined to be vicious because of the alleged attack, not because they were pit bulls. We held that when a dog is determined to be &quot;vicious&quot; under R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a), procedural due process requires that the owner have notice and an opportunity to be heard before the owner is charged with a crime. Id. at ¶ 13.
* {¶ 32} In &quot;Cowan&quot;, the dogs were determined to be vicious under the first two subsections of R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a) because they had caused injury to a person. Thus, the case concerned the dog warden&#x27;s unilateral classification of the dogs as vicious. However, in this case, the &quot;vicious dogs&quot; at issue are those classified as pit bulls under the third subsection of R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a). Unlike the situation in &quot;Cowan&quot;, the General Assembly has classified pit bulls generally as vicious; there is no concern about unilateral administrative decision-making on a case-by-case basis. The clear statutory language alerts all owners of pit bulls that failure to abide by the laws related to vicious dogs and pit bulls is a crime. Therefore, the laws do not violate the rights of pit bull owners to procedural due process.
* {¶ 33} Second, R.C. 955.11 and 955.22 and Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 are not unconstitutional for violating substantive due process or equal protection rights. Laws limiting rights, other than fundamental rights, are constitutional with respect to substantive due process and equal protection if the laws are rationally related to a legitimate goal of government. See &quot;State v. Thompkins&quot; (1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 558, 560–561, 664 N.E.2d 926. As we discussed previously when evaluating whether the statutes and ordinance in question are valid exercises of state and city police power, R.C. 955.11 and 955.22 January Term, 2007 and Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 are rationally related to a legitimate government interest.
* {¶ 34} Finally, the court of appeals erred in holding that R.C. 955.11 and 955.22 and Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 are void for vagueness. This court has previously held that the term &quot;pit bull&quot; is not unconstitutionally void for vagueness. In &quot;State v. Anderson&quot;, we stated: &quot;In sum, we believe that the physical and behavioral traits of pit bulls together with the commonly available knowledge of dog breeds typically acquired by potential dog owners or otherwise possessed by veterinarians or breeders are sufficient to inform a dog owner as to whether he owns a dog commonly known as a pit bull dog.&quot; 57 Ohio St.3d 168, 173, 566 N.E.2d 1224.
* {¶ 35} In conclusion, the state and the city of Toledo possess the constitutional authority to exercise police powers that are rationally related to a legitimate interest in public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. Here, evidence proves that pit bulls cause more damage than other dogs when they attack, cause more fatalities in Ohio than other dogs, and cause Toledo police officers to fire their weapons more often than people or other breeds of dogs cause them to fire their weapons. We hold that the state of Ohio and the city of Toledo have a legitimate interest in protecting citizens from the dangers associated with pit bulls, and that R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a)(iii) and 955.22 and Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 are rationally related to that interest and are constitutional.
Mr. Tellings appealed the case to the Supreme Court of the United States, which declined to hear the case.

=====Texas=====
In &quot;City of Richardson v. Responsible Dog Owners of Texas&quot;, 794 S.W.2d 17 (Tex. 1990), several people (&quot;Responsible Dog Owners&quot;) sued the city of Richardson, Texas, to prevent it from enforcing restrictions on pit bulls within its city limits on the grounds that the Texas state legislature had passed legislation preempting the a city&#x27;s power to adopt an ordinance regulating the keeping of dogs. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city, but the Texas Court of Appeals reversed the trial court&#x27;s decision (781 S.W.2d 667). The Supreme Court of Texas reversed the Court of Appeals and upheld the original decision on the grounds that
Under article XI, section 5 of the Texas Constitution, home-rule cities have broad discretionary powers provided that no ordinance &quot;shall contain any provision inconsistent with the Constitution of the State, or of the general laws enacted by the Legislature of this State...&quot; Thus, the mere fact that the legislature has enacted a law addressing a subject does not mean that the subject matter is completely preempted...Although there is a small area of overlap in the provisions of the narrow statute and the broader ordinance, we hold that it is not fatal.

=====Texas Health and Safety Code=====
In the state of Texas, the State Health and Safety Code prohibits breed-specific legislation as stated
Sec. 822.047. LOCAL REGULATION OF DANGEROUS DOGS. A county or municipality may place additional requirements or restrictions on dangerous dogs if the requirements or restrictions:
(1) are not specific to one breed or several breeds of dogs; and
(2) are more stringent than restrictions provided by this subchapter.

Added by Acts 1991, 72nd Leg., ch. 916, Sec. 1, eff. September 1, 1991.

=====Washington=====
In &quot;McQueen v. Kittitas County&quot;, 115 Wash. 672, 677 (1921), the Washington Supreme Court established the broadly accepted precedent that cities have the power to regulate dogs, even to the point of banning specific breeds.[D]ogs do not stand on the same plane as horses, cattle, sheep, and other domesticated animals...On the general question, it is the almost universal current of authority that dogs are a subject of the police power of the state, and their keeping subject to any kind of license or regulation, even to absolute prohibition...since dogs are a subject of the police power, we see no reason why the legislature may not make distinctions between breeds, sizes and the localities in which they may be kept. The object of the statute is protection. The purpose is to prevent injuries to persons and property by dogs. Any distinction founded upon reasons at least, is therefore valid...&quot;

In &quot;American Dog Owners Ass&#x27;n v. City of Yakima&quot;, 777 P.2d 1046 (Wash.1989, &quot;en banc&quot;), the Washington Supreme Court reviewed a pit bull ban in the city of Yakima. The dog owners asked a state court to prevent Yakima from enforcing its ban on pit bull dogs. The trial court issued a temporary injunction against the city and accepted motions for summary judgment from both the dog owners and the city. The court decided in favor of the city and lifted the injunction, whereupon the dog owners appealed to the Washington Supreme Court on the grounds that the ordinance was vague because a person of ordinary intelligence could not tell what was prohibited, and that the trial court had improperly decided the summary judgment in favor of the city.

The Washington Supreme Court ruled that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because it specified the dog breeds that together fit the definition of &quot;pit bull&quot;, whereas an earlier case in Massachusetts, &quot;American Dog Owners Ass&#x27;n, Inc. v. Lynn&quot;, 404 Mass. 73, 533 N.E.2d 642 (1989), had resulted in the pit bull ban being annulled because the ordinance did not specify in sufficient detail what a &quot;pit bull&quot; was; in addition, the higher court ruled that the summary judgment had been properly awarded, thus upholding the Yakima pit bull ban.

In &quot;Dog Federation of Wisconsin, Inc. v. City of South Milwaukee&quot;, 178 Wis.2d 353, 504 N.W.2d 375 (Wis.App.,1993), the Wisconsin Court of Appeals reviewed the appeal of a trial court decision upholding a pit bull ban in South Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Court of Appeals upheld the trial court on the following grounds:
* The dog owners claimed that the definition of &quot;pit bull&quot; in the ordinance was too vague in its description of a &quot;pit bull&quot;; however, the Court of Appeals found that the ordinance&#x27;s reference to the breed descriptions of the American Kennel Club and United Kennel Club were enough to allow someone to know whether they owned a &quot;pit bull&quot; or not
* The dog owners claimed the pit bull ban ordinance was overbroad because it treated &quot;all pit bulls as if they are inherently dangerous, and more prone to cause harm than other dogs as a matter of law&quot;; however, the higher court found that the prohibition against &quot;overbroad&quot; ordinances protected only fundamental rights such as the freedom of speech, and that there was no fundamental right to own a particular breed of dog.
* The dog owners claimed the pit bull ban violated their right to equal protection since pit bulls were singled out for prohibition, for which there was &quot;no scientific or empirical basis&quot; and that dangerousness is a function of &quot;environment, training, and upbringing.&quot; The Court of Appeals found that the evidence of the unique danger posed by pit bull–type dogs was sufficient that the dog owners could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the discrimination was unfounded, as required by previous court precedent.

<text>James Tytler (17 December 1745 – 11 January 1804) was a Scottish apothecary and the editor of the second edition of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. Tytler became the first person in Britain to fly by ascending in a hot air balloon (1784).

A group of historiographers wrote about him:

== Life ==
Tytler was born in Fern, Forfarshire, Scotland, the son of a Presbyterian minister. His father taught him Greek, Latin and theology. He probably studied for the ministry but was not interested in (Orthodox) Calvinism. He became a preacher in the Church of Scotland and studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, after which he was apprenticed to a ship&#x27;s surgeon for one year. He may not have been awarded a degree, although the 11th edition of Britannica refers to him as James Tytler, M.A. He declined to practise medicine but instead opened a pharmacy in Leith, near Edinburgh, which was a financial failure, leaving him in debt. The two longest articles in the second edition of &quot;Britannica&quot; are Surgery and Pharmacy, reflecting his fields of expertise.

In 1765, Tytler married Elizabeth Rattray, the orphaned daughter of a solicitor. Soon after, he fled Scotland to escape his creditors. His financial problems may have come from his alcoholism. He went to northern England, where he again tried to make a living as an apothecary. After fathering several children there, he returned to Edinburgh in 1772 or 1773. In 1774 or 1775 Tytler separated from his wife; at the time the couple had five children.

Under the pseudonym &quot;Ranger&quot; Tytler published &quot;Ranger&#x27;s Impartial List of the Ladies of Pleasure in Edinburgh&quot; a private book detailing 66 sex workers in the city.

The years when Tytler worked as editor of the Encyclopædia Britannica (1777–1784 for the second edition, and 1788–1793 for the third) were his most lucrative. He also earned income from editing other works and translations. In March 1785 he became bankrupt again, possibly due to the costs of his engaging in hot air ballooning. He moved between several locations in Scotland and northern England. Elizabeth Rattray sued him for divorce in 1788, because he had lived with Jean Aitkenhead since about 1779 and had twin daughters with her.

He returned to Edinburgh in 1791. In 1793 he was charged with sedition for publishing a pamphlet championing the Rights of Man, but fled Scotland prior to his trial, travelling first to Belfast, and then in 1795 to the United States. He was outlawed in absentia. In Salem, Massachusetts, he edited the &quot;Salem Register&quot;, published some works and sold medicine. On 9 January 1804, Tytler left his house drunk; two days later the sea returned his body.

James and Elizabeth Rattray were members of the Glasites, a radical Protestant sect. In the 1770s, Tytler left the sect and denounced it together with all churches. He remained a fervent Christian without denomination. In Salem he never went to church.

== &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; ==
Tytler had previously written more than edited; for example, in 1774 he was the author of two religious pamphlets that earned him little or no money. He came late to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, as editor of the second edition (1777–1784). He was paid less than his predecessor, William Smellie, and it is possible he was engaged because one of the Britannica&#x27;s publishers, Andrew Bell, had been assisted by Tytler on another work. As a group of historiographers wrote, &#x27;Tytler displayed an uncharacteristic steadiness of purpose while working on the second edition.&#x27; Reviews of the second edition were lukewarm, but the sales showed an appreciation by the reading public.

Tytler contributed some long treatises to the third edition (1788–1797), and may have been its first editor before he left Edinburgh in March 1788, the month before the first number was published. This left the editor&#x27;s chair to Britannica&#x27;s co-owner and Bell&#x27;s partner, Colin Macfarquhar. Tytler continued to contribute heavily to the third edition when he came back to Edinburgh, up to the letter M, which was produced in 1792 or 1793.

== Politics ==

The second edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica is politically moderate because Bell and Macfarquhar curbed Tytler&#x27;s reformism. Tytler expressed sympathy for the French Revolution of 1789 and called on the British not to pay taxes. He also denounced public officials. One of his pamphlets, published in 1792, described the House of Commons as a &#x27;vile &quot;junto&quot; of aristocrats&#x27; usurping the rights of king and people. Not money, but honest and upright behaviour should qualify a man for being an elector. As a consequence Tytler was outlawed for sedition in January 1793.

On the ship to America in 1795 Tytler wrote a pamphlet &quot;Rising the sun in the west, or the Origin and progress of liberty&quot;, in which he denounced the elites of the Old World. Disappointed with the Scottish and Irish, he praised the Americans and the French for fighting against superstition and tyranny (despite the suppression of religion in revolutionary France).

== Aviation ==

The inventive Tytler rivalled the French pioneers of hot air ballooning and was the first person in Britain to ascend in a balloon, almost a month before his rival to the title, Vincenzo Lunardi, made a hydrogen balloon ascent in London. Tytler&#x27;s venture was expensive, but succeeded after several attempts on 25 August 1784, in Edinburgh. His balloon rose a few feet from the ground. Two days later he managed to reach a height of not more than 300 feet, travelling for half a mile between Green House on the northern edge of what is now Holyrood Park to the nearby village of Restalrig. Later trials were less fortunate. In October his balloon only took off after Tytler left the basket, to the disappointment of the crowd. Having previously been &#x27;the toast of Edinburgh&#x27;, he was ridiculed and called a coward. His last flight was on 26 July 1785.

Tytler was overshadowed by Lunardi—the self-styled &quot;Daredevil Aeronaut&quot;—who carried out five sensational flights in Scotland, creating a ballooning fad and inspiring ladies&#x27; fashions in skirts and hats. The &quot;Lunardi bonnet&quot; is mentioned in the poem &quot;To a Louse&quot; by Robert Burns.

<text>Wilhelm Friedrich Hemprich (24 June 1796 – 30 June 1825) was a German naturalist and explorer.

Hemprich was born in Glatz (Kłodzko), Prussian Silesia, and studied medicine at Breslau and Berlin. It was in Berlin that he became friends with Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg, the two men sharing an interest in natural history.
Hemprich lectured at Berlin University on comparative physiology, and wrote &quot;Grundriss der Naturgeschichte&quot; (Compendium of Natural History) (1820). In his spare time he studied reptiles and amphibians at the zoological museum under Hinrich Lichtenstein.

In 1820 Hemprich and Ehrenberg were invited to serve as naturalists on a primarily archeological expedition to Egypt, led by Prussian General von Minutoli. The two naturalists were sponsored by the Berlin Academy. In March 1821 they separated from the main party and travelled up the river Nile to Dongola, the capital of Nubia. They spent the next two years studying the natural history of that part of Egypt.

In 1823 Hemprich and Ehrenberg sailed across the Gulf of Suez to El Tur on the south-west coast of the Sinai peninsula, remaining there for nine months. During this time they visited Mount Sinai, and Ehrenberg became one of the first naturalists to study the marine life of the Red Sea. In 1824 they visited the Lebanon, travelling inland from Beirut to the summit of the Jebel Liban and making their base at Bcharre. In August they returned to Egypt.

In November they set off again along the coasts of the Red Sea, calling at various ports including Jidda. They eventually arrived in the Eritrean port of Massawa, their intention being to visit the highlands of Abyssinia. Unfortunately Hemprich died in Massawa of fever, and Ehrenberg buried him on the island of Toalul. Ehrenberg travelled back to Europe, and in 1828 published an account of their discoveries, under both their names, entitled &quot;Symbolae Physicae&quot;. The specimens collected by the expedition were deposited at the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin: they included 46,000 botanical specimens of 3000 species and 34,000 animal specimens of 4000 species. These included many new species.

Hemprich is commemorated in the names of the sooty gull (&quot;Larus hemprichii&quot; ), Hemprich&#x27;s hornbill (&quot;Tockus hemprichii&quot;), and the fossil amber pseudoscorpion (&quot;Pseudogarypus hemprichii&quot;). He is also commemorated in the names of two reptiles: Hemprich&#x27;s skink (&quot;Scincus hemprichii&quot;) and Hemprich&#x27;s coral snake (&quot;Micrurus hemprichii&quot;).

<doc id="730115" wikidata="Q7239054" url="?curid=730115" title="Prayer to Saint Joseph">
<text>The following are Roman Catholic prayers to Saint Joseph.

==The Catholic tradition of Saint Joseph==
Joseph, the silent man of the Gospels, is in the line of the great men of faith of the Old Testament. He is described as a &quot;just man&quot;, a righteous man of integrity. He is in the tradition of Abraham who was called by God to &quot;walk before my face and be upright (Gen: 17.1);and of Moses who was told to be &quot;entirely sincere&quot;, &quot;entirely faithful&quot; (Deut: 18.13). For centuries his place in the story of Jesus was comparatively unnoticed. Gradually, in Catholic tradition, he was recognised as patron of fathers of families, of bursars and procurators, of manual workers, especially carpenters, and of all who desire a holy death.

The parish in Buenos Aires where Pope Francis grew up is dedicated to San José. Solemnly inaugurated on 19 March 2013, Francis’ pontificate is placed under the protection of Saint Joseph. One of the few things the Pope had sent over from Argentina after his election is a statue he had. It depicts the saint lying down asleep, a reference to the gospel accounts of Saint Joseph receiving the counsel of angels in several dreams. The Pope slips pieces of paper with prayer requests under the pedestal of the statue, which is just outside his room at St. Martha&#x27;s House.

“You know,” said Francis, “you have to be patient with these carpenters: they tell you they’ll have a piece of furniture finished in a couple of weeks and it ends up taking a month even. But they get the job done and they do it well! You just need to be patient…”

==Prayer to Saint Joseph after the Rosary==
The purpose of Pope Leo XIII&#x27;s 1889 encyclical &quot;Quamquam pluries&quot; was to implore divine help by means of prayer, joining to the intercession of Mary that of Saint Joseph. Leo XIII therefore attached to his encyclical a special Prayer to Saint Joseph requesting that it be added to the recitation of the Rosary during the month of October. 

The encyclical &quot;Quamquam pluries&quot; established the Prayer to Saint Joseph is mandatory to be recited at the end of each holy Rosary recited during the Marian Month of October. The prescription is forever (in Latin: &quot;perpetuo idem servetur&quot;) and thus it can&#x27;t be deleted by any subsequent Vatican document. It causes an indulgence of seven years and seven Lents.
Moreover, it is recommended, even if not mandatory, in the three days preceding March 19, the day in which the Solemnity of St Joseph takes place. This type of indulgences was abolished by ″&quot;Indulgentiarum Doctrina&quot; of 1967. The &quot;Enchiridion Indulgentiarum&quot; of 2004 reports the partial indulgence for the faithful of Christ who have piously recited a prayer to &quot;Saint Joseph, husband of the Blessed Virgin Mary&quot;, legitimately approved by an episcopal authority (for example the present &quot;To you, blessed Joseph&quot;).

The Prayer to St Joseph may be said after the customary Salve Regina and concluding prayer. It may also be used to conclude other Marian devotions.

:To thee, O blessed Joseph, we have recourse in our affliction, and having implored the help of thy thrice holy Spouse, we now, with hearts filled with confidence, earnestly beg thee also to take us under thy protection. By that charity wherewith thou wert united to the Immaculate Virgin Mother of God, and by that fatherly love with which thou didst cherish the Child Jesus, we beseech thee and we humbly pray that thou wilt look down with gracious eye upon that inheritance which Jesus Christ purchased by His blood, and wilt succor us in our need by thy power and strength.

:Defend, O most watchful guardian of the Holy Family, the chosen off-spring of Jesus Christ. Keep from us, O most loving Father, all blight of error and corruption. Aid us from on high, most valiant defender, in this conflict with the powers of darkness. And even as of old thou didst rescue the Child Jesus from the peril of His life, so now defend God&#x27;s Holy Church from the snares of the enemy and from all adversity. Shield us ever under thy patronage, that, following thine example and strengthened by thy help, we may live a holy life, die a happy death, and attain to everlasting bliss in Heaven. Amen.

==Litany of Saint Joseph==

The litany of Saint Joseph was sanctioned by Pope Pius X in 1909. After the usual petitions to the Holy Trinity and one to the Blessed Virgin, the litany is composed of twenty-five invocations expressing the virtues and dignities of Joseph.

Furthermore, Pius X composed a Prayer to Saint Joseph the Worker for the sanctification of labor.

==Traditional Novena==

A very old and beautiful invocation to Saint Joseph is traditionally prayed for nine days before the Feast of Saint Joseph, starting on March 10. It is found in many places, and was released in 1950 with the Imprimatur of the Bishop of Pittsburgh, Hugh C. Boyle. It is used in novenas, according to the text after the prayer, and the prayer text specifically seems to limit it to &quot;spiritual blessings&quot;.

:&quot;O Saint Joseph, whose protection is so great, so strong, so prompt before the throne of God, I place in you all my interests and desires.&quot;

:&quot;O Saint Joseph, do assist me by your powerful intercession, and obtain for me from your Divine Son all spiritual blessings, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, So that, having engaged here below your heavenly power, I may offer my thanksgiving and homage to the most Loving of Fathers.&quot;

:&quot;O Saint Joseph, I never weary contemplating you and Jesus asleep in your arms; I dare not approach while He reposes near your heart. Press Him in my name and kiss his fine head for me and ask him to return the Kiss when I draw my dying breath.&quot;

:&quot;Saint Joseph, Patron of departed souls – pray for me. (Mention your intention) Amen.&quot;

Older copies of the prayer, sometimes contain an additional comment that,

:&quot;The above prayer was found in the fiftieth year of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. In 1505 it was sent from the Pope to Emperor Charles, when he was going into battle. Whoever shall read this prayer or hear it, or keep it about themselves, shall never die a sudden death or be drowned, nor shall poison take effect on them; neither shall they fall into the hands of the enemy, or shall be burned in any fire or shall be overpowered in any battle. Say for nine mornings in a row for anything you may desire. It has never been known to fail.&quot;

However, the year 50 A.D. is a very early date for a published prayer, preceding much of the New Testament, which does not mention very much about the father of Jesus. The statements about the year 50 A.D. and regarding the Pope and Emperor are not supported.

==&quot;Dear Guardian of Mary&quot;==
&quot;Dear Guardian of Mary&quot; is a hymn written in honor of Saint Joseph by Frederick William Faber in 1863.

<doc id="730118" wikidata="Q531462" url="?curid=730118" title="Prayer to Saint Michael">
<text>The Prayer to Saint Michael the Archangel usually refers to one specific Catholic prayer to Michael the Archangel, among the various prayers in existence that are addressed to him. It falls within the realm of prayers on spiritual warfare. From 1886 to 1964, this prayer was recited after Low Mass in the Catholic Church, although not incorporated into the text or the rubrics of the Mass. Other prayers to Saint Michael have also been officially approved and printed on prayer cards. Prayer to St. Michael the Archangel by Pope Leo XIII:
==Historical context==
The threat to the church at the time was the Italian government&#x27;s campaign against the Papal States. The 1890 text was composed and published twenty years after the capture of Rome had deprived the Pope of the last vestige of his temporal sovereignty. The papal residence at the Quirinal Palace had been converted into that of King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy.

== In the Leonine Prayers ==

In 1886, Pope Leo XIII added a Prayer to Saint Michael to the Leonine Prayers, which he had directed to be prayed after Low Mass two years earlier.

The English translation which was used in Ireland is quoted in James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Variant English translations include: &quot;Holy Michael&quot;, &quot;Saint Michael&quot;, &quot;defend us in battle&quot;, &quot;malice and snares&quot;, &quot;may God rebuke him&quot;, &quot;thrust into hell&quot;, &quot;all evil spirits&quot;, &quot;prowl about the world seeking the ruin&quot;, and &quot;roam throughout the world seeking the ruin&quot;.

The prayer&#x27;s opening words are similar to the Alleluia verse for Saint Michael’s feasts on 8 May and 29 September in the Roman Missal of the time, which ran:
=== History ===

The &#x27;Leonine Prayers&#x27; originated in 1884, when Pope Leo XIII ordered certain prayers to be said after Low Mass, in defense of the independence of the Holy See. God&#x27;s help was sought for a satisfactory solution to the loss of the Pope&#x27;s temporal sovereignty, which deprived him of the independence felt to be required for effective use of his spiritual authority. The prayer to St Michael described above was added to the Leonine Prayers in 1886.

The Pope&#x27;s status as a temporal leader was restored in 1929 by the creation of the State of Vatican City, and in the following year, Pope Pius XI ordered that the intention for which these prayers should from then on be offered was &quot;to permit tranquility and freedom to profess the faith to be restored to the afflicted people of Russia&quot;.

The practice of reciting this and the other Leonine prayers after Mass was officially suppressed by the 26 September 1964 Instruction &quot;Inter oecumenici&quot; which came into effect on 7 March 1965.

Removing the obligation to recite this prayer (along with the three Hail Marys, the Hail Holy Queen, and the prayer for the Church) after Low Mass did not mean forbidding its use either privately or publicly in other circumstances. Thirty years later, Pope John Paul II recommended its use, saying:

On 29 September 2018, Pope Francis asked Catholics everywhere to pray the Rosary each day during the following month of October and to conclude it with the ancient prayer &quot;Sub tuum praesidium&quot; and the Leonine prayer to Saint Michael. He asked them &quot;to pray that the Holy Mother of God place the Church beneath her protective mantle: to preserve her from the attacks by the devil, the great accuser, and at the same time to make her more aware of the faults, the errors and the abuses committed in the present and in the past, and committed to combating without any hesitation, so that evil may not prevail&quot;.

A month earlier, Pope Francis called more generically to &quot;a penitential exercise of prayer and fasting&quot; in view of scandals concerning Catholic Church sexual abuse cases.

== Exorcism prayer ==
A quite different prayer to Saint Michael was included in an exorcism formula published in the 1890−1891 edition of &quot;Acta Sanctae Sedis&quot; for use by bishops and by those priests authorized to perform exorcisms. To any of these who devoutly recited the formula daily Pope Leo XIII granted on 18 May 1890 a partial indulgence on each day and a plenary indulgence whenever they did so for a whole month.

This &quot;Exorcism against Satan and the apostate angels&quot; () opens with some verses from the Psalms and then presents a long prayer to Saint Michael followed immediately by the actual prayer of exorcism, which began with a series of ten conjurations.

The exorcism formula, with its incorporated prayer to Saint Michael, was inserted into the 1898 edition of the &quot;Roman Ritual&quot;.

=== The 1890 prayer to Saint Michael ===
=== The 1902 prayer to Saint Michael ===

In 1902, a year and a half before the death of Pope Leo XIII, a new edition of the &quot;Roman Ritual&quot; considerably shortened the exorcism formula as a whole and in particular the prayer to Saint Michael within it.

In 1999, the Holy See issued a revised version of its &quot;Rite of Exorcism&quot;. In its &quot;supplication and exorcism that may be used in special circumstances affecting the Church&quot;, it includes, for optional use, the 1902 prayer to Saint Michael and also allows it to be replaced by another prayer better known by the people (pp. 76−77). It includes the 1886 (Leonine Prayers) text as one of the &quot;supplications that the faithful can use in their struggle against the powers of darkness&quot; (p. 83). The 1890 prayer is not included.

=== Unauthorized use ===

On 29 September 1985, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, wrote to Catholic Ordinaries, recalling the need to maintain the canonical norm that exorcisms are to be performed only by select priests who have been authorized by the local Ordinary, and that it is therefore illicit for other Catholics to use the formula of exorcism against Satan and the fallen angels, extracted from the one published by order of Pope Leo XIII, still less to use the integral text of this exorcism.

== Prayer of consecration ==

The Opus Sanctorum Angelorum presents the following prayer as an Act of Consecration to Saint Michael the Archangel:

== Stories about the origin of the prayer ==

An article in the Roman journal &quot;Ephemerides Liturgicae&quot; in 1955 gave an account in Latin and Italian of how the Saint Michael prayer (in the Leonine Prayers) supposedly originated. Footnote nine of this account quotes an article in another Italian journal called &quot;La Settimana del Clero&quot; in 1947 by Domenico Pechenino, who worked at the Vatican during the time of Leo XIII, in which he said that after Leo had celebrated a Mass, he seemed to be staring at something, then went to his private office, with his attendants asking if he was well. Half an hour later he had written the Saint Michael prayer.

According to the same article in &quot;Ephemerides Liturgicae&quot;, Giovanni Nasalli Rocca Cardinal di Corneliano wrote in his &quot;Litteris Pastoralibus pro Quadragesima&quot; (&quot;Pastoral Letters for Lent&quot;) that according to Leo&#x27;s private secretary, Rinaldo Angeli, Leo had seen a vision of demonic spirits who were congregating on the Eternal City (Rome); he wrote the Saint Michael prayer, and often said it, in response to the vision. Leo also personally wrote an exorcism prayer included in the &quot;Roman Ritual&quot;, and recommended that bishops and priests read these exorcisms often in their dioceses and parishes. This account, which speaks not of the prayer included in the Leonine Prayers but of the general exorcism of which the prayer was at first a part, and for which it later (1902) served as a sort of preface, an exorcism that the Pope recommended bishops and exorcist priests to perform often, indeed daily, in their dioceses and parishes, and that he himself recited often throughout the day.

Several variants of this story are told. The first to appear in print was in a 1933 German Sunday newspaper article, which stated that, as a result of the vision, shortly after 1880 Leo ordered the prayer to Saint Michael to be recited. In reality, it was only in 1884 that the Pope instituted the Leonine Prayers, still at that time without the prayer to Saint Michael. A year later, a German writer, Fr. Bers, tried to trace the origin of the story and declared that, though the story was widespread, nowhere could he find a trace of proof. Sources close to the institution of the prayer in 1886, including an account of a conversation with Leo XIII about his decision, say nothing of the alleged vision. Bers concluded that the story was a later invention that was spreading like a virus. The story is also found in Carl Vogl&#x27;s 1935 &quot;Begone Satan: A Soul-Stirring Account of Diabolical Possession in Iowa&quot;.

In a later version, the vision is said to have occurred not in 1880, but on 13 October 1884, the year in which the Leonine Prayers were instituted but without the Prayer to Saint Michael. And yet another date, 25 September 1888, two years &quot;after&quot; Pope Leo XIII had added the prayer to the Leonine Prayers, was given in a 1991 version.

Another reported version of the vision relates a detailed conversation between the voice of Satan, who said he would destroy the Church if given enough power and time, and the voice of God, who permits Satan to do what he will. According to William Saunders, writing in the &quot;Arlington Catholic Herald&quot;, Leo said that God permitted Satan to choose a single century in which to work his worst against the Church; he chose the 20th century, and God privately revealed the then-future events of the 20th century to Leo.

<doc id="730119" wikidata="Q10703" url="?curid=730119" title="Tri Yann">
<text>Tri Yann () is a French band from Nantes who play medieval folk rock music drawing on traditional Breton folk ballads.

The band was founded in 1969 by Jean Chocun, Jean-Paul Corbineau and Jean-Louis Jossic – all of whom remained members – hence the suggested name of &quot;Tri Yann an Naoned&quot; (Breton for &quot;Three Johns of Nantes&quot;), &quot;Jean&quot; and &quot;Yann&quot; being respectively the French and Breton versions of the name &quot;John&quot;. They presented their final concerts in September 2021, a celebration of their 50th anniversary as a group, which was delayed by the worldwide corona virus pandemic. In December 2022, co-founder Jean-Paul Corbineau died following a long struggle with leukemia.

As the best known &quot;Celtic&quot; band in France, Tri Yann are one of the longest-standing Breton music groups surviving from the folk rock revival of the 1970s (following the revival of the bagadoù and Alan Stivell&#x27;s work). The group are famous for the outlandish costumes worn on stage.

Among their best-known songs are &quot;La Jument de Michao&quot; (including the chorus &quot;J&#x27;entends le loup, le renard et la belette&quot; i.e. &quot;I hear the wolf, the fox and the weasel&quot;) and &quot;Dans les prisons de Nantes&quot; (&quot;In the prisons of Nantes&quot;). Live performances usually include the Breton national anthem &quot;Bro Gozh ma Zadoù&quot; (&quot;The Land of My Fathers&quot;) which has the same tune to the Welsh National Anthem.

Tri Yann sang the role of Uther Pendragon in Alan Simon&#x27;s rock opera &quot;Excalibur,&quot; as well as Louis XII of France in Simon&#x27;s rock opera &quot;Anne de Bretagne&quot;.

<text>Moravian 47 (Munsee: &quot;Náahii&quot;, literally &#x27;downstream&#x27;, in contrast with Munsee-Delaware Nation, referred to as &quot;Nalahii&quot;, meaning &quot;upstream&quot;) is an Indian reserve located in Chatham-Kent, Ontario, with an area of . It is occupied by the Delaware Nation at Moraviantown First Nation (), a part of the Christian Munsee branch of the Lenape, and is commonly known as Moravian of the Thames reserve. The resident registered population is 457, with another 587 band members living off the reserve.

A group of Munsee was converted to Christianity by missionaries of the Moravian Church in Pennsylvania; these persons and their descendants are known as the Christian Munsee. They moved to Ohio Country, under pressure from European settlers in the east. Vibrant Moravian Christian Indian settlements were established in Schoenbrunn, Gnadenhutten, Salem, Petquotting and Goshen. After many of those in Gnadenhutten and Salem were murdered by American colonial militia in the Gnadenhutten massacre of the Moravian Christian Indian Martyrs on 8 March 1782 during the American Revolutionary War, the remaining Christian Munsee in Ohio gathered in Sandusky and led by Moravian missionary David Zeisberger, departed towards the Thames River. They eventually reestablished their Christian Indian community in what is today southern Ontario. At first temporarily settling near present-day Amherstburg, Ontario, in 1792, Zeisberger obtained permission from the British colonial authorities for the community to inhabit a site on the Thames River, near where it is located today. 

During the War of 1812 between Great Britain and the United States, the Battle of the Thames took place near the community. The Shawnee leader Tecumseh, an ally of the United Kingdom, was killed by invading United States forces. Following the battle, before the US cavalry left the area, it burned the entire Christian Munsee community to the ground. They rebuilt on the south side of the Thames in their present location.

In 1903, the Moravian Christians transferred the Christian Munsee mission in Moraviantown to Methodist Christians, a denomination that eventually joined the United Church of Canada, the United Protestant denomination to which the Christian Munsee in Moraviantown belong to today.

<text>Cartoon Planet is an American television programming block that originally ran from 1995 to 1998 and 2012 to 2014 on Cartoon Network. A spin-off of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, the series centered on Space Ghost recruiting his imprisoned evil nemesis Zorak and his loud and dimwitted archenemy Brak to assist him in hosting a variety show.

&quot;Cartoon Planet&quot; began as an hour-long block of cartoons hosted by Space Ghost, Zorak, and Brak. They would introduce full cartoons from the Turner Entertainment library, such as old theatrical shorts and Hanna-Barbera cartoons, including the original 1960s &quot;Space Ghost&quot; episodes (sometimes with an edited laugh-track). The host segments were often original songs and ad-libbed skits. New material ceased being made in 1997, and most of the songs and skits were re-packaged into 22 half-hour episodes without classic cartoon clips.

== Original series ==
Each episode included segments such as &quot;Brak&#x27;s School Daze,&quot; &quot;Zorak&#x27;s Horror Scopes,&quot; &quot;Poets&#x27; Corner,&quot; &quot;Brak&#x27;s Monday Ratings Report,&quot; &quot;The Top 5 Cartoon Countdown&quot; (discontinued in 1997 after the show&#x27;s Saturday-morning slot was shortened to a half-hour), &quot;Vacation Spots Around the Universe&quot; (pieced together from clips of &quot;Ultraseven&quot; episodes; at the time Turner owned the distribution rights to a dub created in 1985), &quot;Messages from Outer Space&quot; (also from &quot;Ultraseven&quot;, featuring the Hot Dog Men), &quot;Mailbag Day&quot;, readings from &quot;The Cartoon Planet Storybook,&quot; messages from Count Floyd (Joe Flaherty&#x27;s local public-access television cable TV horror movie host from &quot;SCTV&quot;; the segments were originally shown on Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;The Completely Mental Misadventures of Ed Grimley&quot;), &quot;Learning to Talk Italian,&quot; Nuggets of Joy from Zorak,&quot; &quot;Zorak&#x27;s Helpful Hints,&quot; and &quot;Cooking with Brak.&quot;

The show also had short live-action segments featuring producer Andy Merrill wearing an ill-fitting Space Ghost costume doing various things like visiting a petting zoo, getting a haircut (although he kept his mask on), playing tennis, or visiting a gift shop. Intros of the show during the early years featured Merrill in the costume performing an amateur dance to the mambo-style theme music, or sitting in a chair reading a newspaper, falling asleep to lullaby music.

For the first season of the show, the opening and closing theme songs were instrumental excerpts from &quot;No One Knows My Plan&quot; and &quot;The End of the Tour&quot; by They Might Be Giants.

Clips of numerous cartoons from the Turner library would often pop up spontaneously during segments of the show, especially during the music videos. These included &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, &quot;Popeye&quot;, Tex Avery cartoons, pre-August 1948 &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;/&quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; shorts, &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot;, &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, and other classic Hanna-Barbera cartoons. Clips from other Turner-owned properties were used as stock footage as well.

At the time, head writer/producer Pete Smith described &quot;Cartoon Planet&quot; &quot;as a cross between &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot;, &quot;The Electric Company&quot;, and recess at the Richard M. Nixon School for Wayward Boys. ...&quot;Cartoon Planet&quot; skillfully steers clear of any semblance of sophisticated humor. Forced by network muckity-mucks to air his dirty spandex in front of millions of impressionable young minds, Space Ghost dragged a reluctant Zorak and a confused Brak into the treacherous waters of sketch comedy.&quot;

&quot;Cartoon Planet&quot; resulted in three soundtrack CDs: &quot;Modern Music for Swinging Superheroes&quot; in 1996 (a non-commercial promotional album), &quot;Space Ghost&#x27;s Musical Bar-B-Que&quot; in 1997, and &quot;Space Ghost&#x27;s Surf &amp; Turf&quot;, the latter two published by Rhino Entertainment) in 1998. The albums consisted of songs and dialogue skits with different background music not used in the show.

== Revival series ==
The revival of the series premiered on March 30, 2012, and ended on February 8, 2014, featuring a different format from the original series. Due to budget restrictions, Space Ghost did not appear in the revival, thus leaving Brak and Zorak to host the show as &quot;roommates together in their own, stupid little apartment&quot; (despite this, Brak made a mini clone of Space Ghost in one episode). Instead of classic 1960s-era cartoons being showcased, the revival featured Cartoon Network&#x27;s original programming, mostly Cartoon Cartoons, from the mid-1990s to late 2000s. Also, Zorak is not trapped behind a console, instead usually playing video games. Sometimes Zorak will get interrupted by Brak, causing him to lose the game.

Airing in a format based on &quot;The Cartoon Cartoon Show&quot;, the revival aired a variety of classic Cartoon Network shows in 7 or 11-minute segments per-cartoon. This allowed for four or five different cartoons to be aired in the blocks one hour timeslot.

In October 2012, &quot;Cartoon Planet&quot; celebrated Cartoon Network&#x27;s 20th birthday to which it released a special two-minute song sung by Brak. The song paid tribute to the shows throughout the network&#x27;s history.

There have also been holiday-themed episodes, featuring several of the Cartoon Network programming presented in a holiday-themed episode, including Halloween and Christmas.

Starting on January 11, 2013, several &quot;Cartoon Network&quot; shows that have been short-lived, permanent hiatus, canceled, or officially ended joined up to Cartoon Planet&#x27;s programming block starting with &quot;Robotomy&quot;, &quot;Secret Mountain Fort Awesome&quot;, and &quot;The Problem Solverz&quot;, all of which have since been removed in the transition back to the Cartoon Cartoon format. Other short-lived series including &quot; Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones&quot;, &quot;Sheep in the Big City&quot;, &quot;Mike, Lu &amp; Og&quot;, &quot;Time Squad&quot;, and &quot;Squirrel Boy&quot; did not air on the block.

Starting on April 12, 2013, the block began airing YTV, Teletoon, and Warner Bros. Animation programming in which the first were &quot;Scaredy Squirrel&quot;, &quot;Almost Naked Animals&quot;, and &quot;Tom and Jerry Tales&quot;, breaking the show&#x27;s tradition of only airing Cartoon Network original programming. They were subsequently removed. From June 27 to August 9, 2013, the block aired on Thursdays at 1:30 pm ET. On August 30, 2013, the block ran on a Friday night for the last time before it was replaced by &quot;Pizza Night with Pizza Steve&quot;. It aired on Saturdays at 11:30 am ET and Sundays at 11:00 am ET since September 7, 2013. Also, on November 4, 2013, the block started airing on weekdays at 2:00 pm ET.

The revival was animated in Flash, rather than cel animation, like the original &quot;Space Ghost&quot; series (several cels, mainly Brak&#x27;s, were duplicated in Flash). It features stop motion scenes, such as the &quot;Make You Go Splat!&quot; music video.

=== Skits ===
The following are some of the skits that appeared on the 2012 revival:
* Advertisements – Fake advertisements for made-up products which the show indicates as &quot;Not Real&quot;. On rare occasions, two advertisements were shown. The first advertisement aired was for &quot;Bushido Potatoes&quot;.
* Music Video – Original songs sung by Brak and Zorak. The first song was &quot;Pizza Song&quot;, which received positive reviews and internet fame. Zorak also sang in his first music video &quot;Make You Go Splat!&quot; which received internet fame as well.
* Zorak&#x27;s Poetry Beat – Series of poems told by Zorak involving ridiculous items and nonsense lyrics. In one episode, Brak recited the poetry segment because Zorak did not feel like it. The first poem was &quot;Ode to a Diseased Chimpanzee&quot;.
* Brak&#x27;s Comedy Jokes – This segment featured Brak telling jokes to the audience. In one episode, Zorak replaces Brak in the segment now renamed &quot;Zorak&#x27;s Comedy Jokes&quot; telling jokes which are black comedy jokes involving the misfortunes of the people that the joke is centered on.
* Dating Tips with Brak – Brak gives out (usually bad) dating tips to the audience. At the end of each skit, he says &quot;And that&#x27;s a tip from me...&quot;.
* What&#x27;s in my Mouth? – A rare segment in which Brak opens his mouth a little bit while saying &quot;Aaaah&quot; and Zorak had to guess what was in it. Usually, the objects are gross (such as a piece of dental cotton from five weeks ago).
* Make Stuff Happen on the T.V. – A segment in which Brak and Zorak are watching television and they interact with the programs by poking the characters on the screen, commenting to each other, voicing them, and even giving them root beer (Brak).
* Zorak Video Game Chats – A segment in which Zorak reviews a video game on his &quot;Zbox&quot;, which indicates that the games are not real. One example of a reviewed game is &quot;Pasta Grandma&quot;.
* Clones – A one-off skit reminiscent of the skits done on the original show. In one skit, Brak clones himself, Zorak, and even Space Ghost. The clones are smaller, and have their voices provided by Andy Merrill&#x27;s daughter. The skit continued with the little Braks singing the opening theme for the modern show.

== Broadcast history ==
The show&#x27;s first run was from 1995 to 1998, premiering on TBS in 1995 and then moving to Cartoon Network later that year. New material stopped being made around 1997 and the show was repackaged into 22 half hour episodes, consisting entirely of songs and skits.

From September 24 to October 28, 2005, Cartoon Network briefly revived the show on its Adult Swim block, where it ran at 5:30 am Eastern time. The series ran again on Adult Swim from July 8 to October 29, 2006, on Sundays at 5:30 am Eastern time. The reason for the show&#x27;s disappearance from 2001 to 2004 was due to Cartoon Network temporarily losing the rights of all the music videos to Rhino Records, who produced the soundtracks. Often, &quot;Cartoon Planet&quot; skits would be played after an 11-minute &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; episode in 2000 and 2001 as a time filler.

Though no plans for a DVD release have been announced, &quot;Cartoon Planet&quot; segments are included on the &quot;Volume One&quot; DVD release of &quot;The Brak Show&quot;.

The &quot;Cartoon Planet&quot; skits aired again on September 24, 2021, as part of Adult Swim&#x27;s Pete Smith Day marathon. On September 16, 2024, Adult Swim&#x27;s Checkered Past block began airing episodes of the series, with 2 episodes airing every week. New interstitials with Merrill performing a Brak puppet were created for this run.

<doc id="730131" wikidata="Q2444696" url="?curid=730131" title="The 7th Saga">
<text>The 7th Saga is a turn-based role-playing video game developed by Produce! and published by Enix for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993. The game made innovative use of a radar system during gameplay. It featured seven playable characters of various types including humans, an elf, a dwarf, robots, a demon, and an alien. Each character has unique items and spells.

The game &quot;Mystic Ark&quot; was planned to be marketed as a sequel to &quot;The 7th Saga&quot; in North America, but the game was only ever released in Japan.

==Gameplay==

The player chooses one of seven playable characters, all of whom separately embark on a quest to locate seven magical runes. As the player progresses through the game from one town to the next, they encounter the other six characters on multiple occasions. The player may partner with one of the other playable characters to fight as a team, and they may also fight against other playable characters for the runes.

Notable unique innovations include the use of a crystal ball &quot;radar&quot; in the game&#x27;s HUD that allows players to see enemies approaching their character in dungeons and in the overworld. This means that combat is not totally random, as players may theoretically avoid enemies. However, combat is often difficult to avoid as enemies are numerous and move extremely quickly at random, and terrain features that may aid in evasion or navigation are absent in the crystal ball. The game also uses Mode 7 graphic effects to create the transition between exploration screen and battle screen.

There are three modes of play: safe area, enemy-infested area, and in-battle. When the characters are in a safe area, usually in a city, they can walk around as long as they want. The player can talk to non-player characters, buy and sell items, search for hidden items, and rest at an inn. Also, the main character may duel other characters, or even convince one to assist in the search for the runes.

When the player is in an enemy-infested area, the Magic Crystal item in the top-left appears. That crystal shows the player in the center, and the relative locations of nearby enemies, cities, dungeons, and runes. If a white dot reaches the center, i.e. the location of the main characters, a battle will break out. The player must move around quickly while grabbing chests and finding the way, since the enemies are always getting closer.

Battles in the game are turn-based. When the player character is in battle, the perspective shows the character and ally, if any, from behind looking at one to three enemies. Players then select an action and take turns with the enemy and ally. The player can attack, defend, cast a spell, use an item, or run. If the player wins, their characters get experience points, gold, and occasionally items. If they lose, half of their money will be gone. If the player loses to one of the other main characters, their rune(s) will be taken by that character. Gaining experience results in attaining levels which improve a character&#x27;s skill. Buying better weapons and armor with the money improves a character&#x27;s fighting ability.

The game is particularly known for its unforgiving difficulty due to balance changes made in its localization. Enemies were given much higher stats, and the player character&#x27;s stat increases were reduced (the other playable characters retain the original stat increases, so they will always surpass the player character&#x27;s level).

==Story==
The game takes place on a world called Ticondera. Five thousand years before the beginning of the story, a divine being named Saro defeated an evil entity named Gorsia with the power of seven runes. In the years since then, the runes have been scattered across the globe. Lemele (Remeer in the Japanese version), the son of Saro, was born 100 years before the beginning of the game, and became a hero when he defeated the demon Gariso. Now 100 years old, Lemele has become the benevolent and powerful ruler of the world.

The seven characters are recruited from various walks of life and corners of the globe by the elderly King Lemele. After five years of training at his palace, Lemele dispatches his seven apprentices in a quest for the seven runes. Each rune possesses a great power that can be used by the person who wields it. The one who collects all seven runes will become Lemele&#x27;s heir. To find the runes, the king gives each character a Crystal Ball to assist them in their search.

Retrieving the runes means confronting the various powerful tyrants who have come to possess them, including wizards, kings, and dragons. The apprentices are also being hunted by a persistent bounty hunter named Pison (Python in the Japanese version), who has been hired by one of the apprentices to eliminate the rest (the identity of the &quot;traitor&quot; apprentice is randomized with each new game).

After defeating a resurrected Gariso and collecting all seven runes, the player is confronted by Lemele, who reveals that he is actually Gorsia. Gorsia traveled to the present from 5,000 years in the past, killed Lemele and took his identity, then recruited the seven apprentices to locate the runes for him. The power each rune contains is actually a trapped portion of Gorsia&#x27;s power. Gorsia destroys the runes, re-absorbs his lost power, and zaps the player with lightning, sending them to a strange, unfamiliar world which turns out to be Ticondera 5,000 years in the past.

After passing through several towns, the player eventually ends up in the technologically advanced city of Melenam, which was originally explored as ruins by the player early in the game. Melenam is revealed to be the origin of the Tetsujin robots, and the player witnesses the destruction of the city at the hands of a rogue super-Tetsujin created by the city&#x27;s scientists for the purposes of fighting Gorsia.

The player eventually learns that although Saro had recently defeated Gorsia, Gorsia has returned from the future and fatally wounded Saro. Saro&#x27;s disciples give the player the seven runes, which the player uses to seal Gorsia&#x27;s powers and eventually defeat the evil being. The dying Gorsia kills the player in one last act of revenge, but 4,900 years later Saro reincarnates the player&#x27;s soul as a young baby and Saro&#x27;s son: none other than Lemele.

==Characters==
Characters in &quot;The 7th Saga&quot; run along a continuum from predominantly physical-oriented to predominantly magical-oriented. They are, in that order:
* Wilme Pelin: An alien with a fiery, lava-like spiked body. Arrogant and aggressive, he seems to want the runes for power and to prove his superiority. He is strong and has the highest HP of the seven and is tied with the casters for highest speed but suffers from a fixed set of equipment, and a low Magic rating causes his Fire magic to be quite impotent. Best used with characters very reliant on gear as using Wilme will save you a lot of gold.
* LUX TIZER: A 5000-year-old robot created by a long extinct civilization called the Tetsujin. LUX is polite, logical, and inquisitive. He searches for the runes in the hopes that their power may help him unlock the secrets of the Tetsujin&#x27;s origins. LUX is physically very powerful especially in defense, but has a limited selection of magic and equipments, although he is the only one that can use those spells. Among these are the only Laser and Thunder spells usable by a non-NPC character. Along with Esuna, LUX can never be the &quot;traitor&quot; apprentice. Like Wilme, is great with partners who rely on equipment since he doesn&#x27;t really get any equipment.
* Olvan Jaess: An extremely old dwarf warrior, with a pleasant personality. He joins the search for the runes in the hopes that they can restore his youth. Statistically, he is similar to Kamil, but with more HP and Defense, and less MP and speed, and a few differences in equipment/spell selection. Specifically Defense 1 which can help him be even tankier or help his partner.
* Kamil Dowonna: A human knight. The most average, well-rounded character, Kamil has access to a large selection of equipment and can cast both offensive and defensive magic. He wears blue armor and the instruction booklet says that he is best paired with a stronger ally. Unfortunately, the characters all-round average stats makes him the worst character in the game. His health is too low to properly tank, his mana and spellcasting are too low to be a proper mage and his speed is tied with Olvan for being the worst in the game. The equipment he can equip can make up for his lower Power and Defense stats and the spells he can learn can help his partner but there are a lot of better options.
* Lejes Rimul: A power-hungry demon. Sly, manipulative and unapologetically evil, Lejes wants the power of the runes in order to rule the world. Lejes equips very strong weapons and eventually learns every single attack spell (except the LUX-exclusive Laser and Thunder spells), but his selection of armor is quite poor, and his attack spells hit with less force than Esuna. Lejes never learns any healing magic. However, he exclusively learns Defense 2 which halves the targets defense instead of doubling it like Defense 1. This increases the physical damage he can dish out significantly and any partner that is with him. Since he learns this early on (lvl 9) this makes him a lot more physically oriented than spellcasting despite his wide variety of spells.
* Valsu Saizer: A human cleric who has dedicated his life to the cause of good, Valsu wishes to use the runes to bring peace and prosperity to the world. He is depicted as a young man in the Japanese game art, but as elderly in the North American release. He has excellent healing magic and one powerful Ice spell, but lacks skill in physical combat. He is the only playable character who learns the spells Agility and Elixir, making him a powerful ally.
* Esuna Busy: An elf magic user, Esuna seems to regard the search for the runes as some sort of fun adventure. She begins the game cocky and headstrong, but becomes more uncertain and less confident as the story progresses. She has extremely high Speed and Magic potency, and can use both kinds of magic, but her attack spells are exclusively Ice-elemental and she is physically very weak. Like LUX, Esuna never turns out to be the &quot;traitor&quot; apprentice.

== Reception ==
&quot;The 7th Saga&quot; received moderately positive reviews. &quot;GamePro&quot; applauded the game&#x27;s graphics, animation, music, sound effects, and non-linearity of the plot, but criticized the combat and puzzles. The reviewer elaborated that the enemy monsters are tactically too similar to each other, making the player&#x27;s choices of action essentially meaningless, which in combination with the frequent rate at which enemies are encountered makes combat quickly become a chore rather than fun. He also felt that the limited dialogue would disappoint fans of story-driven RPGs like &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;. Mike Weigand of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; was enthusiastic about its Mode 7 effects and non-linear gameplay.

==Proposed sequel==
Enix planned to market the game &quot;Mystic Ark&quot; as a sequel to &quot;The 7th Saga&quot; in North America, under the title &quot;7th Saga II&quot;, but the game&#x27;s localization was never completed, and it was released only in Japan under its original name.

<doc id="730136" wikidata="Q357585" url="?curid=730136" title="Marcus Antonius Creticus">
<text>Marcus Antonius Creticus ( 74 - 72 BC), was a Roman politician during the late Roman Republic. He is best known for his failed pirate-hunting career and for being the father of the general Mark Antony.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Creticus was the son of the famed orator Marcus Antonius. He had a sister named Antonia and a younger brother named Gaius Antonius Hybrida.

===Career===
He was elected praetor in 74 BC and received an extraordinary commission, similar to that bestowed upon triumvir Pompey by the Gabinian law seven years later in 67 BC, and that conveyed on his father three decades before in 102 BC, to clear the Mediterranean Sea of the threat of piracy, and thereby assist the ongoing operations against King Mithridates VI of Pontus. Creticus not only failed in the task, but plundered the very provinces he was supposed to protect from robbery. He attacked the Cretans, who had made an alliance with the pirates, but was totally defeated, most of his ships being sunk. 
Diodorus Siculus states that he only saved himself by a disgraceful treaty. As a result of this defeat he was mockingly given the cognomen &quot;Creticus&quot;, which means &quot;conqueror of Crete&quot;, and also &quot;man made of chalk&quot;, when translated from Latin. He died soon afterwards (72 or 71 BC) in Crete. Most authorities are agreed as to his avarice and incompetence, but the biographer Plutarch describes him as a friendly, honest and generous man.

==Family==
Antonius was married to a woman named Numitoria, a daughter of Quintus Numitorius Pullus, but they had no known children. Afterwards he married Julia with whom he had three sons: Marcus Antonius (the triumvir), Gaius Antonius and Lucius Antonius, as well as a daughter named Antonia, who married Publius Vatinius.

<doc id="730137" wikidata="Q1325616" url="?curid=730137" title="International Ornithologists' Union">
<text>The International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOU) is an international organization for the promotion of ornithology. It links basic and applied research and nurtures education and outreach activities. Specifically, the IOU organizes and funds global congresses on ornithology at regular intervals, sets up and supports commissions and committees on various aspects of avian biology and conservation, and initiates and backs other international ornithological activities with specific aims consistent with its own mission and goal. It discloses the names and professional affiliations of its members on its website to encourage international collaboration and networking. The IOU acts as the Ornithology Section of the IUBS.

== Vision ==
The IOU has the objective of supporting, promoting, and advancing avian biology by disseminating ornithological knowledge to the scientific community and the public; interacting with other scientific organizations, foundations, and institutions that share similar interests and goals; stimulating and strengthening locally-based research that includes the participation of amateur ornithologists who contribute valuable data and insights; cultivating relationships among ornithologists internationally; and fostering knowledge transfer between basic research and applied sciences, such as conservation, that can benefit from the findings and recommendations of ornithology.

== History ==
International congresses in science were rare until the late nineteenth century. One of the first ones was the 1st International Ornithological Congress in 1884, which was motivated by a borderless problem in avian biology: avian migration. This is one of the most remarkable aspects of avian biology, as many bird species travel north and south every year, but little was understood about it at that time. In Europe, where many countries were involved, studying avian migration demanded an international effort. Rudolf Blasius and Gustav von Hayek devised a grand plan for a multi-nation program on avian migration in Europe, secured the support of Crown-Prince Rudolf of Austria-Hungary, and arranged the 1st International Congress of Ornithology in Vienna, April 1884, which concentrated mainly on migration studies. They established a complicated system to collect and publish migration data from Europe, but it collapsed in the 1890s due to too much information that was not analyzed.

The 2nd Congress in Budapest in 1891 focused mainly on avian migration, but also included other areas of avian biology such as a major summary of avian classification by Richard Bowdler Sharpe. The 3rd Congress in Paris covered the whole range of ornithological research, and this was followed in London, 1905 and Berlin, 1910 where the next congress, planned for Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, in 1915 became a sign of the upcoming First World War. Ernst Hartert was largely responsible for reviving the congresses in Copenhagen, in 1926, where future meetings were set at every four years. The Règlement des Congrès Ornithologiques Internationaux, adopted in 1932, was only published at the Rouen Congress in 1938. It formalized the establishment and operation of the International Ornithological Committee. World events again prevented the staging of the 1942 Congress scheduled for the USA, and the next congress to be held was the 10th in Uppsala, Sweden, in 1950.

Plenary lectures by world specialists giving summaries of advances in the various fields of ornithology at the time have been a highlight of congresses: Heinroth on the ethology of ducks and Lucanus on avian physiology at the 5th Congress; Lambrecht on avian physiology and Dunker on avian genetics at the 7th; Nice on the life history of the Song Sparrow at the 8th; Mayr on avian speciation, Dorst on avian migration, Tinbergen on behavior and Lack on ecology at the 10th; Sibley and Ahlquist with The Tapestry – the first molecular phylogeny of the Aves – at the 19th; Schodde and Christidis on the Gondwanan origin of the Australasian avifauna and global implications at the 20th; Walter Bock&#x27;s Presidential debate between Martin and Sereno on the origin of birds from reptilian ancestors at the 23rd ; and Bairlein on migration, illustrating the huge advances since Dorst, at the 26th. Presidential addresses, moreover, sometimes reviewed important historical aspects in ornithology, such as the contribution of amateurs in biology, the role of museum development, and, as at the 23rd Congress, the history of the international ornithological congresses themselves.

The first congress outside Europe was held in Ithaca, New York, in 1962, and the first for the southern hemisphere was held in Canberra, Australia, in 1974. Congresses in their current format began in Berlin, 1978, where Donald Farner set up the first International Scientific Program Committee, and formulated new organizational Statutes and bylaws to replace the Règlement. A pattern of plenary lectures, symposia, contributed papers, and round table discussions was established there too. By 1986, it became clear that the tasks of secretaries-general appointed to arrange congresses had become too extensive, and that more organizational continuity was needed for managing the International Ornithological Committee. That led to the creation of the position of permanent secretary at the Ottawa Congress in Canada in 1986; Walter Bock was the foundation appointee, holding the position until 1998, when Dr. Dominique Homberger took over at the Durban Congress in South Africa.

==International Ornithological Congress==
Organized by the IOU, the International Ornithological Congress series is the oldest and largest series of international meetings for bird scientists. The series started in 1884 and has been held every four years since 1926, except for two times when the Second World War disrupted the schedule.

===Meetings===
== IOU Memberships ==
IOU members can enjoy access to the IOU webinars by ornithologists; discounts on books by selected publishers; members-only registration fees to the International Ornithological Congresses, and other IOU-sponsored events; participation in and/or establishment of working groups to address specific projects or issues; voting rights on particular IOU matters and more. The IOU offers different membership options based on the World Bank economic income categorization. Members can also support the IOU&#x27;s mission and programs through donations.

== IOU Webinars ==
The IOU webinars are a series of online lectures that showcase the latest research and developments in ornithology. The webinars feature speakers from different countries and institutions who share their insights and findings on various topics related to bird biology, ecology, behavior, conservation, and education. The webinars are free and open to members. The webinars are also recorded and uploaded on the IOU website and YouTube channel, where they can be accessed anytime.

== Working Groups ==
The IOU provides platforms for working groups that focus on specific topics and are led by experts in their field and specialists. The working groups aim to support, promote, and advance avian biology by reaching out to ornithologists, conservationists, policy makers, non-governmental organizations, educators, and other stakeholders. Some of the current working groups are:
* Avian Checklists: This working group produces and maintains an open-access global checklist of bird species and subspecies based on rigorous taxonomic principles and transparent decision-making processes.
* Avian Morphology: This working group fosters collaboration and communication among researchers who study the form and function of birds, including anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, development, and evolution.
* Bird Marking: This working group promotes the use of standardized methods and best practices for marking birds for scientific and conservation purposes.
* Birds as Peacemakers: This working group explores the potential of birds as catalysts for peace-building and conflict resolution in regions affected by violence and instability.
* Ethics in Ornithology: This working group develops and disseminates ethical guidelines for ornithological research, education, and outreach.
* Psittaciformes: This working group addresses the conservation challenges and research needs of parrots, one of the most threatened groups of birds in the world.
* Gondwanan Ornithology: This working group facilitates collaboration and exchange among ornithologists from the southern continents that were once part of Gondwana, such as Africa, South America, Australia, Antarctica, and India.

<text>Simon Jones (born 27 July 1950) is an English actor. He is best known for originating the role of Arthur Dent, protagonist of Douglas Adams&#x27; &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. He also played the role of Donald Shellhammer in &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; (1994), appeared in &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; as Lord Brideshead, and as King George V in the film &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;.

==Early life==
Jones was born 27 July 1950, in Charlton Park, Wiltshire, England. When young, his family moved to Broad Town near Wootton Bassett (before it was Royal), travelling often to visit elderly aunts in Salisbury. Jones studied at King&#x27;s College, Taunton, before going up to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, at age 25.

==Career==
Jones appeared in various television series, including &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;, in which he played the Earl of Brideshead, or &#x27;Bridey&#x27;, heir to the Marquess of Marchmain, and the second series of &quot;Blackadder&quot; (1986), playing Sir Walter Raleigh in the episode &quot;Potato&quot;. His films have included &quot;Club Paradise&quot; (1986), &quot;Privates on Parade&quot; (1982), &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Own&quot; (1997).

Jones was studying at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he was a member of the Footlights and met Douglas Adams. This led to him being cast in &quot;Out of the Trees&quot; and later &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. The latter project, a radio broadcast from 1978, would be the first of Jones&#x27;s several portrayals of Arthur Dent; Adams claimed to Jones that he wrote the part of Dent with him in mind. In &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s The Meaning of Life&quot;, Jones had a minor role as one of the guests at the dinner party which is interrupted by the Grim Reaper. He has also appeared in some of the solo film projects of the members of Monty Python: &quot;Privates on Parade&quot; (with John Cleese), &quot;American Friends&quot; (1991) with Michael Palin. He appeared in the Terry Gilliam film &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985) alongside Jonathan Pryce and Robert De Niro, also worked alongside Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt in &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; (1995). 

Jones has appeared in many Broadway plays, including &quot;The Real Thing&quot; (1985), as Max, &quot;Benefactors&quot; (1985), as Colin, &quot;Getting Married&quot; (1991), as Reginald Bridgenorth, &quot;Private Lives&quot; (1992), as Elyot Chase, &quot;The Real Inspector Hound&quot;, (as Moon) and &quot;The Fifteen Minute Hamlet&quot; (as Hamlet - which played together in 1992), &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; (1995), as Joseph Surface, &quot;Ring Round the Moon&quot; (1999), as Romainville and as Perry Lascoe in &quot;Waiting in the Wings&quot; (1999).

In 2009, Jones appeared in &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;, as Dr. Bradman, supported by Angela Lansbury and Rupert Everett; and in 2018 he portrayed John Rich, in &quot;Farinelli and the King&quot; co-starring Mark Rylance. Off-Broadway he has a long list of credits, and was nominated for the 1990 Drama Desk Award Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play for his role in &quot;Privates on Parade&quot;.

Jones is also a voice actor and audiobook narrator, with more than 70 titles to his credit. Among them are:

* &quot;The Long Dark Teatime of the Soul&quot; for Simon and Schuster Audioworks for the US market
* &quot;Star Trek: Cacophony&quot;, playing Lt. Commander Stewart Mulligan in an original &quot;Captain Sulu Adventures&quot; audio programme, again for Simon and Schuster
* &quot;The Salmon of Doubt&quot;, for New Millennium Audio
* &quot;Douglas Adams at the BBC&quot;, for BBC Audio
* &quot;The Bartimaeus Sequence&quot; by Jonathan Stroud: &quot;The Amulet of Samarkand&quot;, &quot;The Golem&#x27;s Eye&quot;, &quot;Ptolemy&#x27;s Gate&quot;, &quot;The Ring of Solomon&quot;
* &quot;A Slight Trick of the Mind&quot; by Mitch Cullin, which won the Audio Publishers Association&#x27;s 2006 Audie Award for Unabridged Fiction.
* &quot;And Another Thing...&quot;, the sixth instalment of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; series, written by Eoin Colfer.
*&quot;Cloud Cuckoo Land&quot; by Anthony Doerr

In 2003, Jones reprised his role as Arthur Dent in a new radio series of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. In the same year he was involved in the filming of the film version of the first novel, making a brief cameo appearance in the role of the holographic Magrathean answering machine/automated defence system.

In 2009, Jones was heard as master detective Sexton Blake on BBC Radio 2 in the six-part series, &quot;The Adventures of Sexton Blake!&quot;.

In 2012 and 2013, he returned to the UK, to star in a national stage tour of &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy – Live!&quot;

The tour of &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;, starring Angela Lansbury, then went to London&#x27;s West End in early 2014. This was followed by BBC Radio appearances in Neil Gaiman and Terry Prachett&#x27;s &quot;Good Omens&quot;, directed by Dirk Maggs, and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; with Tom Baker. 

In 2018, Jones was once again playing Arthur Dent when he recorded the final radio series, &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy – the Hexagonal Phase&quot; directed by Dirk Maggs for BBC Radio 4.

In August 2018, it was announced that Jones would be among the new cast to join the original actors in the &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; film, which started principal photography at about the same time.

In addition to his work as an actor, Jones is also a co-artistic director at New York Off-Broadway company the Actors&#x27; Company Theatre (TACT).

==Personal life==
Jones and his son Tim were hit by a car on 8 October 2010; though they suffered only bruises, he had to withdraw from The Actors Company Theatre&#x27;s production of Václav Havel&#x27;s &quot;Memorandum&quot;. On 20 December 2019 his wife, Nancy Lewis, died in Manhattan of leukemia aged 76.

<text>Fred Wesley (born July 4, 1943) is an American trombonist who worked with James Brown in the 1960s and 1970s, and Parliament-Funkadelic in the second half of the 1970s.

==Biography==
Wesley was born the son of a high school teacher and big band leader in Columbus, Georgia, and was raised in Mobile, Alabama. As a child, he took piano and later trumpet lessons. He played baritone horn and trombone in school, and when he was around 12, his father brought a trombone home, whereupon he switched (eventually permanently) to trombone.

During the 1960s and 1970s, he was a pivotal member of James Brown&#x27;s bands, playing on many hit recordings including &quot;Say it Loud – I&#x27;m Black, and I&#x27;m Proud,&quot; &quot;Mother Popcorn&quot; and co-writing tunes such as &quot;Hot Pants.&quot; His slippery riffs and precise solos, complementing those of saxophonist Maceo Parker, gave Brown&#x27;s R&amp;B, soul, and funk tunes their instrumental punch. In the 1970s, he also was band leader and musical director of Brown&#x27;s band the J.B.&#x27;s, and did much of the group&#x27;s composing and arranging. His name was credited on &#x27;Fred Wesley &amp; the J.B.&#x27;s&#x27; recording of &quot;Doing It to Death,&quot; which sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in July 1973. He left Brown&#x27;s band in 1975 and spent several years playing with George Clinton&#x27;s various Parliament-Funkadelic projects, even recording a couple of albums as the leader of a spin-off group, The Horny Horns.

Wesley became a force in jazz in 1978 when he joined the Count Basie Orchestra. He released his first jazz album as a leader, &quot;To Someone&quot;, in 1988. It was followed by &quot;New Friends&quot; in 1990, &quot;Comme Ci Comme Ca&quot; in 1991, the live album &quot;Swing and Be Funky&quot;, and &quot;Amalgamation&quot; in 1994.

In the early 1990s, Wesley toured with his colleagues from the James Brown band, Pee Wee Ellis and Maceo Parker, as the JB Horns. With the departure of Ellis, the band became the Maceo Parker Band. Wesley was featured as a trombonist with Parker until 1996 when he formed his own band, The Fred Wesley Group, now known as Fred Wesley and the New JBs.

Wesley recorded an album with San Diego soul-jazz luminaries The Greyboy Allstars in 1994 called &quot;West Coast Boogaloo&quot;, and toured with the band in 1995, 1996 and again in 2012.
Wesley&#x27;s career includes playing with and arranging for a wide variety of other artists including Ray Charles, Lionel Hampton, Randy Crawford, Vanessa Williams, The SOS Band, Cameo, Van Morrison, Socalled and rappers De La Soul, to name a few. Many other artists have sampled his work. In 2002 Wesley wrote &quot;Hit Me, Fred: Recollections of a Sideman&quot;, an autobiography about his life as a sideman. Also in 2002 he recorded an album entitled &quot;Wuda Cuda Shuda.&quot;

Wesley was an adjunct professor in the Jazz Studies department of the School of Music at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro from 2004 to 2006, and now works with students as a visiting artist at numerous other schools, including Berklee College of Music and Columbia College of Chicago. In addition to performing with his own band, he tours as part of a collaboration called Abraham Inc. along with Klezmer artist David Krakauer and Klezmer/hip-hop artist Socalled.

In 2007, Wesley accepted an invitation to contribute to &quot;Goin&#x27; Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino&quot; (Vanguard). He participated with Lenny Kravitz, the Rebirth Brass Band, Troy &quot;Trombone Shorty&quot; Andrews, Pee Wee Ellis and Maceo Parker to contribute their version of Domino&#x27;s &quot;Whole Lotta Lovin&#x27;.&quot;

In 2010, Wesley contributed to &quot;Kings&quot; (Freestyle Records), the fourth album by Israeli funk and groove ensemble the Apples. Specific sessions on the album were dedicated to working with Wesley, one of the group&#x27;s heroes.

<text>In publishing, sidebar is a term for information placed adjacent to an article in a printed or Web publication, graphically separate but with contextual connection.

The term has long been used in newspaper and magazine page layout. It is often used as the title of legal groups&#x27; publications in the US as a pun on &quot;the bar&quot;, a term for the legal profession: The Federal Bar Association, Montgomery Bar Association of Norristown Pennsylvania, and the Westmoreland Bar Association are 3 examples.

It is now common in Web design, where sidebars originated as advertising space and have evolved to contain information such as quick links to other parts of the site, or links to related materials on other sites. Online sidebars often include small bits of information such as quotes, polls, lists, pictures, site tools, etc.

<text>Richard Ernest Bellman (August 26, 1920 – March 19, 1984) was an American applied mathematician, who introduced dynamic programming in 1953, and made important contributions in other fields of mathematics, such as biomathematics. He founded the leading biomathematical journal Mathematical Biosciences, as well as the Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications.

==Biography==
Bellman was born in 1920 in New York City to non-practising Jewish parents of Polish and Russian descent, Pearl (née Saffian) and John James Bellman, who ran a small grocery store on Bergen Street near Prospect Park, Brooklyn. On his religious views, he was an atheist. He attended Abraham Lincoln High School, Brooklyn in 1937, and studied mathematics at Brooklyn College where he earned a BA in 1941. He later earned an MA from the University of Wisconsin. During World War II, he worked for a Theoretical Physics Division group in Los Alamos. In 1946, he received his Ph.D. at Princeton University under the supervision of Solomon Lefschetz. Beginning in 1949, Bellman worked for many years at RAND corporation, and it was during this time that he developed dynamic programming.

Later in life, Richard Bellman&#x27;s interests began to emphasize biology and medicine, which he identified as &quot;the frontiers of contemporary science&quot;. In 1967, he became founding editor of the journal &quot;Mathematical Biosciences&quot;, which rapidly became (and remains) one of the most important journals in the field of Mathematical Biology. In 1985, the Bellman Prize in Mathematical Biosciences was created in his honor, being awarded biannually to the journal&#x27;s best research paper.

Bellman was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 1973, which was removed but resulted in complications that left him severely disabled. He was a professor at the University of Southern California, a Fellow in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1975), a member of the National Academy of Engineering (1977), and a member of the National Academy of Sciences (1983).

He was awarded the IEEE Medal of Honor in 1979, &quot;for contributions to decision processes and control system theory, particularly the creation and application of dynamic programming&quot;. His key work is the Bellman equation.

==Work==

===Bellman equation===
A Bellman equation, also known as the &quot;dynamic programming equation&quot;, is a necessary condition for optimality associated with the mathematical optimization method known as dynamic programming. Almost any problem which can be solved using optimal control theory can also be solved by analyzing the appropriate Bellman equation. The Bellman equation was first applied to engineering control theory and to other topics in applied mathematics, and subsequently became an important tool in economic theory.

===Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation===
The Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation (HJB) is a partial differential equation which is central to optimal control theory. The solution of the HJB equation is the &#x27;value function&#x27;, which gives the optimal cost-to-go for a given dynamical system with an associated cost function. Classical variational problems, for example, the brachistochrone problem can be solved using this method as well. The equation is a result of the theory of dynamic programming which was pioneered in the 1950s by Richard Bellman and coworkers. The corresponding discrete-time equation is usually referred to as the Bellman equation. In continuous time, the result can be seen as an extension of earlier work in classical physics on the Hamilton–Jacobi equation by William Rowan Hamilton and Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi.

===Curse of dimensionality===

The &quot;curse of dimensionality&quot; is an expression coined by Bellman to describe the problem caused by the exponential increase in volume associated with adding extra dimensions to a (mathematical) space. One implication of the curse of dimensionality is that some methods for numerical solution of the Bellman equation require vastly more computer time when there are more state variables in the value function. For example, 100 evenly spaced sample points suffice to sample a unit interval with no more than 0.01 distance between points; an equivalent sampling of a 10-dimensional unit hypercube with a lattice with a spacing of 0.01 between adjacent points would require 1020 sample points: thus, in some sense, the 10-dimensional hypercube can be said to be a factor of 1018 &quot;larger&quot; than the unit interval. (Adapted from an example by R. E. Bellman, see below.) 

===Bellman–Ford algorithm===
Though discovering the algorithm after Ford he is referred to in the Bellman–Ford algorithm, also sometimes referred to as the Label Correcting Algorithm, computes single-source shortest paths in a weighted digraph where some of the edge weights may be negative. Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm accomplishes the same problem with a lower running time, but requires edge weights to be non-negative.

==Publications==
Over the course of his career he published 619 papers and 39 books. During the last 11 years of his life he published over 100 papers despite suffering from crippling complications of brain surgery (Dreyfus, 2003). A selection:
* 1957. &quot;Dynamic Programming&quot;

<text>Tim Matheson (born Timothy Lewis Matthieson; December 31, 1947) is an American actor and director. Some of his best-known acting roles include the title character of the 1960s animated &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; TV series, Eric &quot;Otter&quot; Stratton in the 1978 comedy film &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;, and the recurring role of Vice President John Hoynes in the 2000s NBC drama &quot;The West Wing&quot;, which earned him two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.

==Early life==
Matheson was born in Glendale, California, the son of Clifford Matthieson, a training pilot, and Sally Matthieson. Matheson served a tour of duty in the United States Marine Corps Reserve.

==Career==
At age 13, Matheson appeared as Roddy Miller in Robert Young&#x27;s CBS nostalgia comedy series &quot;Window on Main Street&quot; during the 1961–1962 television season. In the 1962–1963 season he appeared in two episodes of &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;, cast as Mike Harmon, a friend of Beaver’s. In 1964, he provided the voice of the lead character in the animated series &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;. He also supplied the voices of Sinbad Jr. the Sailor in the 1960s Hanna-Barbera animated series &quot;Sinbad Jr. and his Magic Belt &quot; and Jace in &quot;Space Ghost&quot;. He co-starred as Joe Hardy, opposite Richard Gates as Frank Hardy, in a 1967 pilot episode for what would have been a TV series called &quot;The Hardy Boys&quot;, based on the novel series of the same name, but the series was not picked up.

<doc id="730182" wikidata="Q176122" url="?curid=730182" title="Marcus Antonius (orator)">
<text>Marcus Antonius (143–87 BC) was a Roman politician of the Antonius family and one of the most distinguished Roman orators of his time. He was also the grandfather of the famous general and triumvir, Mark Antony.

==Career==
His &quot;cursus honorum&quot; begins with the quaestorship in 113 BC and an incident involving the Vestals, and in 102 Antonius was elected praetor with proconsular powers for the Roman province of Cilicia. During his term, Antonius fought the pirates with such success that the Senate voted a naval triumph in his honor. He was then elected consul in 99, together with Aulus Postumius Albinus, and in 97, he was elected censor. He held a command in the Social War in 90. During the civil war between Cinna and Octavius, Antonius supported the latter. This cost him his life; Gaius Marius and Cinna executed him when they obtained possession of Rome in 87.

Throughout Antonius&#x27; political career, he continued to appear as a mediative defender or an accuser in Roman courts of law. Antonius&#x27; modern reputation for eloquence derives from the authority of Cicero, since none of his speeches survive. He is one of the chief speakers in Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De Oratore&quot;.

==Family==

Antonius had a daughter, Antonia, and two sons, Marcus Antonius Creticus and Gaius Antonius Hybrida. Marcus Antonius Creticus was the father of the triumvir Mark Antony.

In 100 Antonius obtained a triumph, because he had fought successfully against the Cilician pirates. Some time later his daughter Antonia was kidnapped by pirates from his villa near Misenum and was only released after the payment of a large ransom.

==Death==
In the biography of Gaius Marius in Plutarch&#x27;s Parallel Lives, it is described that Marcus Antonius went to visit a humble plebeian who, to make his distinguished guest feel at home, sent a slave to a nearby innkeeper to get some wine. When the innkeeper asked why he was buying such an expensive wine, the slave naively told the innkeeper that Marcus Antonius was visiting his master&#x27;s house. When the slave left, this innkeeper went to tell Marius.

It is said that on hearing the news during a meal that Marius applauded with joy and almost went to the house in person; however, he sent Annius with a group of men to bring back the head of Marcus Antonius. When the men reached the house, Annius waited outside while his armed men went in. When they found Antonius he began to plead for his life and the armed men found him so bewitching and charismatic that they hung their heads and wept. Finally Annius entered the room. Hurling curses at his men, he finally strode across the room and cut off the orator&#x27;s head.

<text>The Psychomachia (&quot;Battle of Spirits&quot; or &quot;Soul War&quot;) is a Latin poem by Prudentius, writing during the late antiquity early in the fifth century CE. In roughly a thousand lines, the poet describes the conflict of vices and virtues as a battle in the style of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Christian faith is attacked by and defeats pagan idolatry to be cheered by a thousand Christian martyrs. 

The poem was extremely popular, and survives in many medieval manuscripts, 20 of them illustrated. The work is often considered among the most influential medieval allegory, the first in a long tradition including the &quot;Romance of the Rose&quot;, &quot;Everyman&quot;, and &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;. The poem may be the subject of wall paintings in the churches at Claverley, Shropshire, and at Pyrford, Surrey, both in England. In the early twelfth century it was a common theme for sculptural programmes on façades of churches in western France, such as Aulnay, Charente-Maritime.

The word may be used more generally for the common theme of the &quot;battle between good and evil&quot;, for example in sculpture. The duality depicts the different moral realms humans battle within themselves: all are participating in the war of the soul, because Vice and Virtue both live within them, while their decisions and actions determine the outcome of the conflict.

==Antecedents==
A manuscript discovered in 1931 records a speech by the second-century academic skeptic philosopher Favorinus that employs psychomachia, suggesting the technique predates Prudentius.

==Characters==
The plot consists of the personified virtues of Hope, Sobriety, Chastity, Humility, etc. fighting the personified vices of Pride, Wrath, Paganism, Avarice, etc. The personifications are women because in Latin, words for abstract concepts have feminine grammatical gender; an uninformed reader of the work might take the story literally as a tale of many angry women fighting one another, because Prudentius provides no context or explanation of the allegory.

*Faith (Fides) strikes Worship-of-the-Old-Gods Idolatry (Veterum Cultura Deorum) on the head.
*Chastity (Pudicitia) is assaulted by Lust (Sodomita Libido), but cuts down her enemy with a sword.
*Patience (Patientia) enrages Wrath (Ira), who attacks but cannot defeat or even injure her. Driven mad with frustration, Anger ultimately kills herself instead.
*Humility (Mens Humilis) otherwise known as Lowliness, sees Pride (Superbia) charging her, but her horse stumbles, and Pride is thrown in a pit that Deceit has already dug across the field.
*Sobriety (Sobrietas) plants her flag and restores the courage that was taken from the other virtues by the temptation of Indulgence (Luxuria).
*Good Works (Operatio) strangles Greed (Avaritia) who has seized the entire human race.
*Concordia, having heard such great blasphemy, pins the tongue of Discordia with a spear and stops her breath.

In a similar manner, various vices fight corresponding virtues and are always defeated. Biblical figures that exemplify these virtues also appear (e.g. Job as an example of patience).

Despite the fact that seven virtues defeat seven vices, they are not the canonical seven deadly sins, nor the three theological and four cardinal virtues.

==Notable manuscripts==

*Berne, Burgerbibliothek Cod. 264, region of Lake Constance c. AD 900. Parchment, 145 foll., 27.3/28.3 x 21.5/22 cm. The ms. is counted among the outstanding examples of Carolingian book art. It contains all seven poems by Prudentius plus an added eighth poem; given to the Strasbourg diocese in the 990s and later was acquired by Jacques Bongars.
*Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 23; Prudentius, &quot;Psychomachia&quot; and other poems, 10th century, English.
*London, British Library, Add MS 24199, part 1; Miscellany (Prudentius, &quot;Psychomachia&quot;), 10th century.
**MS Cotton Cleopatra C VIII; Prudentius, &quot;Psychomachia&quot;, 10th century.

Theatre historian, Jonas Barish uses the term psychomachia to describe anti-theatrical conflict during the nineteenth century.

Kirsty Allison used Psychomachia as the title for her cult novel, set in the 1990s (Wrecking Ball Press, 2020). The first edition also publishes a translation, and a modernised edit was later published in LoveLove magazine.

<doc id="730189" wikidata="Q1584293" url="?curid=730189" title="Dissected plateau">
<text>A dissected plateau is a plateau area that has been severely eroded such that the relief is sharp. Such an area may be referred to as mountainous, but dissected plateaus are distinguishable from orogenic mountain belts by the lack of folding, metamorphism, extensive faulting, or magmatic activity that accompanies orogeny.

==Formation==
A dissected plateau may also be formed, or created, usually on a comparatively small scale, by the levelling of terrain by planing and deposition beneath an ice sheet or perhaps, an ice cap. 

Subsequently, during the same or a later glacial, the margins of the glacial till plain are removed by glaciers, leaving the plateau into which erosion by water incises valleys. Such a plateau may be level or gently sloping but may be distinguished by the till caps on its hills. Glacial till is still widely known in Britain by the older name of boulder clay.

Dissected volcanic plateaus include the Pajarito Plateau in New Mexico, on the skirt of the enormous Valles Caldera. Isolated portions of this plateau are known as mesas, and long, connected portions are known as potreros.

==Distribution==
The Allegheny Plateau, the Cumberland Plateau, the Ozark Plateau, and the Catskill Mountains in the United States, the Blue Mountains and Hornsby Plateau in Australia and the Deccan Plateau in India are examples of dissected plateaus formed after regional uplift.

These older uplifts have been eroded by creeks and rivers to develop steep relief not immediately distinguishable from mountains. 

Many areas of the Allegheny Plateau and the Cumberland Plateau, which are at the western edge of the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America, are called &quot;mountains&quot; but are actually dissected plateaus. One can stand on the top of one of these high &quot;mountains&quot; and note that all the other tops are nearly the same height, which represents the original elevation profile of the plain before uplift, and thereafter the subsequent weather erosion.

<doc id="730190" wikidata="Q8069723" url="?curid=730190" title="Zeta Psi">
<text>Zeta Psi () is a collegiate fraternity. It was founded on June 1, 1847, at New York University. The organization now has 90 chapters, with roughly 70,000 members. Zeta Psi is a founding member of the North American Interfraternity Conference.

As one of the world&#x27;s oldest collegiate fraternities, Zeta Psi has historically been selective about the campuses at which it establishes chapters. The chapter at the University of California, Berkeley (June 10, 1870) made Zeta Psi the first fraternity in the U.S. west of the Mississippi. Its chapter at the University of Toronto, (March 27, 1879) was the first in Canada. The founding of the &quot;Eta chapter&quot; at Yale University (1889) briefly made it the only fraternity to have chapters at all eight Ivy League schools. The fraternity became intercontinental on May 3, 2008, with the chartering of &quot;Iota Omicron&quot; at the University of Oxford, and then with the chartering of &quot;Theta Omicron&quot; at Trinity College Dublin in 2012. Its newest chapter, &quot;Psi Omicron&quot; at the University of Paris, joined on May 18, 2019.

The motto is &quot;ΤΚΦ&quot; in Greek, rendered in English as &quot;Tau Kappa Phi&quot;, &quot;TKP&quot;, or &quot;TKPhi&quot;.

Zeta Psi&#x27;s headquarters is located in Pearl River, New York.

== History ==

=== 1847 to 1860: Foundation and early expansion ===

On June 1, 1847, three students at New York University, John Bradt Yates Sommers, William Henry Dayton and John Moon Skillman, formed a new Greek-letter society in a New York City bungalow. The three men formed the core of the first chapter, &quot;Phi&quot;, but William Dayton was stricken with poor health and left New York shortly afterward for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Dayton died within the year.

The &quot;Phi chapter&quot; at NYU persisted in his absence and graduated its first member the next year with George S Woodhull (Φ &#x27;48). The second chapter was established as &quot;Zeta&quot; at Williams College in Massachusetts. The &quot;Delta chapter&quot; was founded at Rutgers University later that year and is the most continuously active chapter of the fraternity, still being active as of 2025.

Three chapters followed in 1850: &quot;Omicron&quot; (now &quot;Omicron Epsilon&quot;) at Princeton University, &quot;Sigma&quot; at the University of Pennsylvania, and &quot;Chi&quot; at Colby College in Waterville, Maine. The first two are still active, but the &quot;Chi chapter&quot; ended in 1988. In the early 1980s, Colby College prohibited fraternities on campus, despite the long and storied tradition fraternities had enjoyed there. By 1988, the &quot;Chi&quot; chapter was ejected from campus and banned from any formal rush, quietly expiring after over 130 years of existence. Problems beset other early chapters as well. The first &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; was founded in 1852 at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, but members met resistance from the administration, and the chapter became inactive in 1872, permitting its letter to be used for the later chapter founded at Columbia.

=== 1860 to 1864: American Civil War ===
In 1860, Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the United States, and South Carolina seceded from the Union, followed shortly thereafter by other Southern states. Expansion of Zeta Psi halted as campuses rallied for war and sent companies of soldiers to battle.

At the outbreak of war, the &quot;Upsilon chapter&quot; at UNC—only chartered three years before—found itself the only chapter of Zeta Psi among all the Southern states, divided from the North by the sudden lines of enmity. Even as they mustered for war and marched south, the Grand Chapter of Zeta Psi, specially assembled in early July 1862, adopted the resolution of Brother William Cooke (Φ &#x27;58) prescribing unity:

And the brothers of &quot;Upsilon&quot; replied by letter in like fashion:



The tale of Brother Henry Schwerin (Θ &#x27;63) illustrates the embodiment of love even in the most trying of circumstance. Schwerin lay gravely wounded after the bloody Battle of Chattanooga; pinned on the breast of his Union uniform was the badge of Zeta Psi. A passing Confederate soldier, also a Zete, spied the badge and carried the invalid to medical care and safety, ignoring even the imperatives of war for the sake of his brother. The worthy badge later passed into the hands of his brother, Max Schwerin (Θ &#x27;70), who would one day serve as international president. After his death, it was donated by his sister to the Fraternity&#x27;s archives and remains among its treasures. Brother John Day Smith (Ε &#x27;72) witnessed the incident on the Chattanooga field and later related it to Brother Francis Lawton (Ε &#x27;69), who would author the poem &quot;The Badge of Zeta Psi,&quot; later set to original music and preserved to this day. The reference to &quot;Chattanooga&#x27;s bloody field&quot; is not an idle hyperbole, but the recollection of a rare triumph among such sorrows.

Amid this sorrow and heroism where so many brothers of Zeta Psi perished, so too were whole chapters swallowed by the War. The &quot;Eta&quot; (Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, chartered in 1861), &quot;Psi Epsilon&quot; (Dartmouth), &quot;Upsilon&quot; (UNC), &quot;Epsilon&quot; (Brown), and &quot;Theta&quot; (Union) chapters had vanished by the end of the conflict, decimated by fallen brothers or disheartened campuses returning from the shadow of death. The &quot;Theta&quot; and &quot;Eta chapters&quot; would never survive the staggering losses they suffered, though the others ultimately recovered and reactivated. The &quot;Gamma chapter&quot;—chartered 1861 at the Georgia Military Institute, as the only new chapter during the War—was annihilated utterly by General Sherman&#x27;s march and existed thus only for those few years of tumult. However, out of the shadow of war came regrowth and a time for Zeta Psi to expand once more.

=== 1864 to 1914: Breaking new ground ===

The nation was still young indeed even after the end of the Civil War: California had only recently become a State, committing to the side of the victorious Union and contributing its men––though the conflict took place mainly across the continent thousands of miles away. It was then only fitting that the Fraternities should next move to California. As pioneers in many initiatives, Zeta Psi was the first fraternity west of the Mississippi river and hence also the first to establish a chapter on the West Coast. In 1870, Zeta Psi established the &quot;Iota chapter&quot; at the University of California, Berkeley (though the &quot;Iota chapter&quot; would not be joined until 1892 by the next Western addition, the &quot;Mu chapter&quot; at Stanford University).

Zeta Psi was not even content to remaining a national Fraternity, so the fraternity pressed northward into Canada. The brothers of the &quot;Xi chapter&quot; at the University of Michigan in 1879 constituted the &quot;Theta Xi chapter&quot; at the University of Toronto, making Zeta Psi the first international Fraternity. Since then, Zeta Psi has actively bolstered its Canadian presence, commissioning a director solely for Canadian chapter development and amassing a long list of successful chapters there.

The end of the 19th century was fertile ground for Zeta Psi. It took root at no fewer than fourteen colleges in those latter days: &quot;Omega&quot; was founded at University of Chicago in 1864; &quot;Pi&quot; at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1865; &quot;Lambda&quot; at Bowdoin College, 1867; &quot;Beta&quot; at University of Virginia, 1868; &quot;Psi&quot; at Cornell University, 1868; &quot;Iota&quot; at UC Berkeley, 1870; &quot;Gamma&quot;, first at the US Naval Academy in 1874, and then at Syracuse College in 1875 after the government proscribed Fraternities at its military academies; &quot;Theta Xi&quot; at University of Toronto, 1879; &quot;Alpha&quot; at Columbia University, 1879; &quot;Alpha Psi&quot; at McGill University, 1883; &quot;Nu&quot; at Case Western Reserve, 1884; &quot;Eta&quot; at Yale, 1889; &quot;Mu&quot; at Stanford, 1892; &quot;Alpha Beta&quot; at University of Minnesota, 1899. The establishment of the &quot;Eta chapter&quot; at Yale marked Zeta Psi as the only fraternity to establish chapters at all eight Ivy-League schools.

Even as the physical reach of Zeta Psi made great bounds, so too did the principles underlying its brotherhood. By the turn of the century, the need for some more centralized structure pressed, as chapter after chapter was added to the Circle and their correspondence became too much to handle so chaotically. In 1909, an international publication concerning the affairs of Zetes was first published by Brother William Comstock (Ξ &#x27;99) and distributed among the several chapters: The Circle of Zeta Psi. The periodical, which is still published to this day, contained in that first issue the exhortation which has come to be known as &quot;The Vision of Bill Comstock&quot; for its prescience and wisdom:

In short, Brother Comstock criticized the degree of individualism among the chapters of Zeta Psi, demanding unity among such disparate brothers. He prescribed that every member should receive the fledgling Circle of Zeta Psi and thus be apprised of the far-flung doings of the fraternity; that a general secretary be commissioned to travel among the chapters and treat with them; and that a foundation be established for the pecuniary support of the general Fraternity. And all three of his mandates have been amply fulfilled: The Circle is still published and distributed to the brothers of Zeta Psi (and can be read online here); now the General Secretary is assisted in his rounds by chapter consultants, whose function remains the same; and the Zeta Psi Educational Foundation was to be instituted within Brother Comstock&#x27;s lifetime, though still in the future. Before Zeta Psi could turn to such collegiate concerns, war again threatened, and this time abroad.

=== 1914 to 1920: World War I===
Though already inured to the horrors and trial that War would wreak upon her from the bloody American Civil War, war in Europe came suddenly in the 1910s and caught a nation and fraternity unawares. For some time, the United States did not commit troops to the battle, maintaining an isolationist stance protected. But Canada was a Dominion within Britain&#x27;s Commonwealth, and when Great Britain entered the war, Canada willingly answered the call.

With the first Canadian chapter only founded at Toronto in 1879, her sister chapters were still young when war came to them. Particularly stricken were the &quot;Alpha Psi&quot; and &quot;Theta Xi chapters&quot; at McGill and U Toronto. Even in 1914, they were already sending letters indicating their brothers were heading east across the sea to the war. In 1915, more than half the workers at the McGill Base Hospital were Zetes from &quot;Alpha Psi&quot;. By war&#x27;s end, the two beleaguered chapters had sent two hundred of the brothers in defense of King and Country; 31 were never to return and many others came home wounded in body and spirit.

Perhaps most noted among the rolls of the brave Canadian brethren who went overseas is Lt. Col. Brother Dr. John McCrae (Θ Ξ &#x27;94), a serviceman in the Canadian army, who like so many other men did not return at the close of conflict. But Brother McCrae bequeathed to his fraternity more than even his worthy life, but also a poem which has been preserved in great honor as both a historical and literary work: &quot;In Flanders Fields.&quot; The words are a testament to the heroic spirit in man and are treasured still by the brethren of Zeta Psi as the hallowed words of a brother whose time long ago passed. The 19-year-old engineering student from McGill, brother Frederick Fisher was the first Canadian to win the Victoria Cross in the war, the highest British award for valour, for his determined stand at the Second Battle of Ypres. Like so many who win this medal, the award was posthumous.

Finally in 1917, the United States entered World War I, and so did the many Zetes. At the annual convention of Zeta Psi, the brothers adopted a resolution in support of U.S. engagement in World War I, which the U.S. Congress had only declared a few weeks previously:


Nor was the pledge mere idle words nor fatuous boasting. Over one-quarter of all brethren of Zeta Psi would serve during the First World War in foreign lands, and many did not return. Zeta Psi also provided the nation its first Assistant Secretary of War, Brother Benedict Crowell (Η &#x27;91), noted for his bold reorganization of civilian military control during World War I. Even after the war, Crowell remained politically powerful, and was later instrumental in engineering the repeal of National Prohibition.

=== Patron Saints ===

Each chapter of Zeta Psi chooses at its founding a patron saint to represent the chapter. There is no particular criteria for a chapter patron saint, other than the chosen figure must have some historical significance either to the chapter or the chapter&#x27;s respective locality. The patron saints are as follows:

== Literature ==

=== Directory of the Zeta Psi Fraternity ===

First published in 1859, with two later editions in 1867 and 1883, the &quot;Catalogue of the Zeta Psi Fraternity&quot; contained names of members of the Fraternity arranged by chapters and years of initiation. In 1874, the &quot;Addenda to the Catalogue of the Zeta Psi Fraternity 1867-1874&quot; was published to complement the 1867 edition of the &quot;Catalogue of the Zeta Psi Fraternity.&quot; In 1888, the title was changed to the &quot;Directory of the Zeta Psi Fraternity&quot; and contact information was added for members of the Fraternity. Later editions of The Directory were produced in 1889, 1893, 1910, 1912, 1913, 1916, 1922, 1926, 1932, 1953, 1987, 1992, and 1998. The &quot;Semicentennial Biographical Catalogue of the Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America&quot; was published in 1899. This volume contained biographies of over 4000 members of Zeta Psi from 1847 to 1900 and historical information about each chapter. The Directory continues to be published on a regular basis and the modern version is a useful networking tool for members of the Zeta Psi Fraternity.

=== Songs of the Zeta Psi Fraternity ===

First published in 1871, by undergraduate members of the &quot;Psi chapter&quot; at Cornell University, &quot;Songs of the Zeta Psi Fraternity&quot; contains a collection of songs about the Zeta Psi Fraternity. Later editions appeared in 1890, 1897, 1903, 1914, and 1958. &quot;The Chapter&quot;, a brief compilation of poems, was also written by members of the Zeta Psi Fraternity in 1869.
=== &quot;The Jubilee of the Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America&quot; ===

Published in 1903, &quot;The Jubilee of the Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America&quot; is a record of the fiftieth anniversary of the Zeta Psi Fraternity. Likewise, &quot;The Double Diamond Jubilee of the Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America&quot; published in 1997 was an account of the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the Zeta Psi Fraternity, made to complement &quot;The Story of Zeta Psi&quot;. Both volumes include historical information on the fraternity and its chapters.

=== &quot;The Circle&quot; ===

First published in June 1909, &quot;The Circle&quot; is the annual publication of the fraternity. The corresponding secretary has the duty of filing a report for &quot;The Circle&quot; every year. The Circle was preceded by other periodic publications that were unsuccessful. These publications were &quot;The Zeta Psi Monthly&quot; published in 1883; &quot;The Zeta Psi Quarterly&quot; published from 1884 to 1886; and &quot;The Bulletin of the Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America&quot; first published in 1897.

=== &quot;The Story of Zeta Psi&quot; ===

Published in 1928, with two later editions, &quot;The Story of Zeta Psi&quot; contains the detailed history of the fraternity and each chapter founded up to the point of publication.

=== &quot;Pledge Manual of the Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America&quot; ===

The first published in 1942, the &quot;Pledge Manual of the Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America&quot; remains in publication and is a crucial source of information for men pledging the Zeta Psi Fraternity.

== Chapters ==
Zeta Psi, like all conventional university fraternities, operates as chapters at various campuses across North America and the world. Zeta Psi has chapters in six countries: Canada, the United States, England, Ireland, France, and Greece. Its chapter in Scotland is dormant.

=== Active chapters ===

The active chapter is the core of the Zeta Psi experience.

==== Chapter governance ====

Zeta Psi is modeled after most modern democracies in that they have legislative, judicial, and executive branches of governance.

===== Chapter meeting =====

Each chapter meeting with due quorum has the authority to act as the legislative organ of the chapter. Most chapters run their meetings with parliamentary rules of order.

===== Supreme Council =====

The Supreme Council is the chapter&#x27;s only judicial body. It has authority to rule on almost any matter and its proceedings are held &quot;in camera&quot;. It is composed of the Phi and Alpha Phi and at least three elected members-at-large.

==== Naming ====

Each chapter in Zeta Psi has a unique name composed of one or two Greek letters. Rather than being assigned a name in a strict order of alphabetization, a petitioning colony that receives a charter chooses a name for their chapter. From this point on, the name is fixed. Even if the chapter goes inactive—in that it has no undergraduate members—the name will be taken up by any group that re-establishes a chapter at that university campus.

The name can be based on many different factors. For instance, it is common for new chapters to take on an element from an existing chapter that has helped them form. &quot;Theta Xi&quot; in Toronto adopted the &quot;Xi&quot; from their neighbor chapter in Michigan, and in turn chapters in Ontario started adding &quot;Theta&quot; as part of their name from their relationship to the Toronto chapter. There are now many chapters in Ontario and there is no pre-requisite to have a Theta in the name. Other times, a name is related to other factors like the Roman Catholic Villanova University chapter being named &quot;Alpha Omega&quot; due to the Christian significance.

A one or two-letter name can only be re-used if the chapter possessing the name is pronounced &quot;deceased.&quot; This has not happened since 1892.

=== Elder chapters ===

For each undergraduate chapter at a campus, there is a corresponding elder chapter composed of alumni members.

==== Chapter governance ====

An elder chapter has a similar organizational structure to the active chapter, with Greek-letter officers and a supreme council.

===== Greek-letter officers =====

There are only six Greek-letter officers in the elder chapter that act as its executive.
* Phi – Φ – Elder President
* Alpha Phi – ΑΦ – Elder Vice-president
* Sigma – Σ – Elder Secretary
* Gamma – Γ – Elder Treasurer
* Delta – Δ – Elder historian
* Beta Pi – ΒΠ – Elder advisor to the active chapter

===== Chapter meeting =====

Elder chapters are also required to hold annual chapter meetings to serve as a legislative body.

===== Supreme Council =====

The Supreme Council is the chapter&#x27;s only judicial body. It has authority to rule on almost any matter and its proceedings. It may hear appeals and rule on matters from the active supreme council. It is composed of all the elder officers and at least three elected members-at-large.

==== Naming ====

The elder chapter has the same name as the active chapter but has different organization, powers, and is legally a separate entity.

=== Geographical associations ===

Geographical associations are similar to elder chapters, in that they are composed of alumni and have a vote at Grand Chapter. However, they are larger in scope and have no active affiliation. Geographical associations mostly base their membership on alumni living in a metropolitan area.

Active geographical associations (as of 2006)
* Zeta Psi Washington, D.C. Elders Association
* Zeta Psi New York City Elders Association
* Philly Zete RAC
* Zeta Psi Chicago Alumni Club
* Zeta Psi Boston Alumni Club
* Zeta Psi Arizona Alumni Club
* Zeta Psi Dallas Alumni Club
* Houston Association of Zeta Psi
* Southern California Association of Zeta Psi Alumni
* Zeta Psi Alumni Association of Greater Pittsburgh
* Zeta Psi Elders Association of Durham
* Zeta Psi Elders Association of Toronto
* Zeta Psi Alumni of Cleveland
* Zeta Psi of Texas

=== Grand Chapter ===

The Grand Chapter is composed of the seven grand officers and one voting delegate from each active and elder chapter and geographical association. The Grand Chapter has complete and total authority over Zeta Psi.

==== Chapter governance ====

The Grand Chapter has a similar organizational structure to the active chapter, with Greek-letter officers but with an executive committee in place of a supreme council.

===== Greek-letter officers =====

Grand Chapter has the same number and function of Greek-letter officers however, the name has an additional &quot;alpha&quot; to denote it as different. At one point in time, there were several appointed officers each designated Chi Phi Alpha (ΧΦΑ) of a particular area (e.g. Canada, or the Northwest United States) which served as geographical representatives to the Grand Chapter.
* Phi Alpha – ΦΑ – President and executive head
* Alpha Phi Alpha – ΑΦΑ – Vice-president
* Sigma Alpha – ΣΑ – Secretary
* Alpha Sigma Alpha – ΑΣΑ – Corresponding secretary
* Gamma Alpha – ΓΑ – Treasurer and fiscal officer
* Delta Alpha – ΔΑ – Fraternity historian
* Sigma Rho Alpha – ΣΡΑ – Sergeant-at-arms

===== Annual meeting of the Board of Delegates =====

The Board of Delegates elects the Grand Chapter officers and may amend the by-laws and act as the legislative body of the Grand Chapter.

===== Executive committee =====

The executive committee is constituted as follows: &quot;Phi Alpha, Alpha Phi Alpha, Sigma Alpha, Gamma Alpha, Delta Alpha, and four (4) representatives duly elected at large from the Fraternity, with the provision that at least one member of the Committee must be from Canada and at least one must be from the United States.&quot;

== Notable members ==
== Zeta Psi in popular culture ==
* Steve Berman, who was a member of the &quot;Beta Tau chapter&quot; at Tulane University, featured the fraternity in his short story &quot;His Mouth Will Taste of Chernobyl&quot;.

<doc id="730199" wikidata="Q3491825" url="?curid=730199" title="Alphabet soup (linguistics)">
<text>Alphabet soup is a metaphor for an abundance of abbreviations or acronyms, named for a common dish made from alphabet pasta. Its use dates at least as far back as Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s alphabet agencies of the New Deal. In the United States, the federal government is described as an alphabet soup on account of the multitude of agencies that it has spawned, including the NSA, CIA, FBI, USSS, ATF, DEA, EPA, NCIS, IRS and INS. In 1938, a US barbershop harmony organization was founded, aptly named SPEBSQSA or the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America, as a humorous lampoon to these numerous &quot;alphabet soup&quot; agencies.

The alphabet soup metaphor has been used to describe issues in comprehension that have major effects on scholarship, including confusion between different theories. One such example of alphabet soup affecting scholarship is in statistical testing, in which distinction between p and α are not always made clear because of the &quot;alphabet soup&quot; of letters referring to statistical evidence and errors. The many distinctions between types of pneumonia have also been described as an alphabet soup, requiring a scholarly article detailing the differences between the many acronyms.

Alphabet soup has also been used to describe longer initialisms based on &quot;LGBT&quot; such as &quot;LGBTQQIAAP&quot;. Alphabet soup is also used to describe historical language scripts that appear as long sequences of symbols that do not have clear demarcations of words.

<text>Amacuzac is a city in the Mexican state of Morelos. The name means &quot;In the River of Yellow Amates.&quot; Amacuzac stands at , at a mean height of 900 meters (3,000 ft.) above sea level. The city serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of the same name. The municipality reported 17,772 inhabitants in the year 2015 census and covers a total surface area of 125 km2 (48.3 miles2). The 2020 census reported 17,598 inhabitants in the municipality and 5,575 in the city of Amacuzac.

==History==
The ancestors of the people of Amacuzac demonstrate Olmec influence. Small beads, vessels, human figurines, ceremonial whistles, and stone carvings have been dated to the years 900 to 500 BCE, coinciding with the peak of La Venta in Tabasco.

During the Colonial era, Amacuzac belonged to the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca. Martin Cortés built the Hacienda de San Gabriel, and in 1554 he ceded land to build a church along the highway to Acapulco. The church, which took three hundred years to build, was founded by Franciscans and was called &quot;San Gabriel Yermo&quot; in honor of Gabriel J. de Yermo. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, Amacuzac lost a great deal of its territory to the hacienda of San Gabriel.

General Agustín de Iturbide maintained his headquarters in &quot;San Gabriel Amacuzac&quot; during the Mexican War of Independence. He met with General Vicente Guerrero at the hacienda before agreeing to the Plan of Iguala that ended the war in 1821.

The town of Amacuzac was nearly wiped out in 1850 due to cholera. The ruins of this town can be found one kilometer south of the present town, which was founded by Aniceto Aranda in 1853. The town was rebuilt largely due to the efforts of Aranda. By 1884, several families from Teacalco and Contlalco had settled there, and in 1890 the people of Amacuzac built a &quot;chalana&quot; (barge) to transport merchandise from Acapulco. 

In 1891 Amacuzac was the scene of a conference between representatives of the states of Morelos and Guerrero to establish the border. As a result, the border was established in the &quot;Serranía de Ocotlán&quot;, which was signed into law on April 30, 1892, ratified by President Álvaro Obregón on May 23, 1923. Dissatisfied with the religious beliefs of the village of San Gabriel, President Plutarco Elías Calles seized land belonging to this village and granted it to &quot;Las Palmas&quot;, creating &quot;San Gabriel Las Palmas&quot;.

Alfonso Miranda Gallegos, the candidate of Juntos Haremos Historia (Together we will make history coalition), was elected municipal president in the election of July 1, 2018, with 57% of the votes. Despite his 2,500 vote victory, he was never certified as the winner because he had been arrested for organized crime and murder six weeks earlier (he is the uncle of a leader of Los Rojos drug cartel). Ramiro Iturbe Parra was sworn in as interim mayor on October 2, 2019.

While the state of Morelos reported 209 cases and 28 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, as of April 27, 2020, no cases were reported in Amacuzac. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. On June 2, Amacuzac reported five confirmed cases and the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. Amacuzac reported 19 cases, 16 recuperations, and one death as of August 31. Forty-seen cases were reported on December 27,2020.

==Monuments and museums==
===La Hacienda de San Gabriel Las Palmas===
The monastery was built upon the orders of Hernán Cortés in 1529. When the Franciscans were forced to abandon their monastery in 1558, San Gabriel was converted to a sugar cane plantation, eventually becoming the largest important refinery in Mexico. The Hacienda was also an important rest point for travelers along the Acapulco-Mexico City trail. During the Mexican War of Independence, insurgent Leonardo Bravo was betrayed and captured at the hacienda of San Gabriel; he was later executed in Mexico City. Later, in 1821, the hacienda was the scenario of a plot between Vicente Guerrero and Agustín de Iturbide to make the latter emperor of Mexico. During the &quot;Porfiriato&quot;, while he was at the Hacienda of San Gabriel, President Porfirio Diaz ordered the execution of Andres Molina Enriquez, a leading advocate of land reform. During the Mexican Revolution, the hacienda served as a headquarters for Emiliano Zapata. Today the ex-hacienda is a hotel/restaurant/spa/museum. Visitors can also see the historical watchtower and jail.

Zoofari is a Safari park in Teacalco featuring 130 different species and over 1,500 animals. Founded in May, 1984, the park is based on respect for nature, generating awareness of protection to life, to promote empathy, love, and learning the wonderful animal world and the environment. The park is divided into six sections, five for you to travel by car and admire life closely. The park has a zip line, restaurant, and gift shop.

<text>Marvin Travis Runyon (September 16, 1924 – October 3, 2004) was an American business executive and civil servant. He had a long career as a manufacturing executive at Ford Motor Company until his retirement, then joined Nissan as head of North American operations. He later served as chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and as U.S. Postmaster General. He was a forceful and charismatic figure who picked up the nicknames &quot;Marvelous Marv&quot; and &quot;Carvin&#x27; Marvin&quot;.

==Ford Motor Company==
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School (Dallas, Texas) in 1942 and started working for Ford at the now-closed Dallas Assembly Plant in 1943, where his father was also employed. He served in the United States Army Air Forces later during 1943 to 1945 and returned to Ford. After graduation from Texas A&amp;M University in 1948 he began to climb in management, making the rounds through Ford assembly plants in Atlanta, Georgia, and Lorain, Ohio, during the 1950s.

He was a plant manager during the 1960s . He lived in London, Ontario, Canada, where he supervised the opening and staffing of the Talbotville (St. Thomas) assembly plant which begun operations in 1967.

He became an executive at the assembly operations headquarters in 1969 and became assembly division general manager in 1972. From 1973 to 1977 he was vice-president in charge of powertrain and chassis operations, then became vice president in charge of vehicle assembly and body stamping operations in 1978. When he retired at the end of 1980 it was widely rumored that he was going to head all Nissan operations in the United States, but that announcement did not come until several days after he had actually retired.

==Nissan North America==
In 1981, Runyon became the chief executive of Nissan North America and supervised the construction of its assembly and engine plants in Smyrna, Tennessee. These plants became among the most productive in the auto industry. Despite being a top manager, &quot;Runyon wore the same blue jumpsuit as assemblers and ate lunch alongside them in the company cafeteria&quot;, saying that &quot;Erasing the symbolic gap between the assembly line and the executive office was key to building the worker&#x27;s sense of identification with the company&quot;.

When Runyon moved onto the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1988, he was succeeded by another former Ford plant manager, Jerry Benefield. Benefield had been head of the Ford assembly plant in Dearborn, Michigan when he joined Nissan North America as the organization&#x27;s first vice president of manufacturing at the bequest of Runyon. In July 1989, Benefield successfully defeated a United Auto Workers union drive attempting to organize the Nissan Smyrna plant.

==Tennessee Valley Authority==
In 1988, Runyon was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to head the Tennessee Valley Authority. TVA, America&#x27;s largest electric power producer, was struggling with enormous debts from its failing nuclear power program. A creation of the New Deal era, TVA had also been the Congressional dumping ground for a multitude of unrelated Federal programs and projects. TVA managed not only nuclear plants, but ran recreation facilities, tested electric cars, produced fertilizer, and even owned a herd of buffalo—in all, more than 186 separate business units. TVA&#x27;s electric rates had skyrocketed in past years to pay for uncompleted nuclear plants, and high electric rates were threatening the region&#x27;s economy.

The nomination process was noted for its hastiness. He received the support of Senator Al Gore Jr and Senator James Sasser, among others, but groups like the Tennessee Valley Authority Board Appointment Coalition felt the process was a &quot;runaway train&quot; and that Runyon had failed to foster partnership with them and the Valley citizens. Runyon was the first presidential appointee since the creation of the TVA Board Appointment Coalition to outright refuse to answer the coalition&#x27;s questions. Before his appointment, he remained quiet on most issues, stating that he would seek more information if appointed. Runyon and those who supported him argued that his managerial experience at Ford and Nissan USA was more important and relevant than his lack of experience in utilities, hydroelectric energy, or land management.

Runyon, a serious-minded technical manager, believed that TVA&#x27;s management had too many distractions from TVA&#x27;s wide-ranging activities, so he ordered non-essential business units closed. Runyon&#x27;s aggressive cost cutting began with a promise to residential and commercial customers that TVA would not increase rates under his watch. This pledge forced TVA management to reduce costs in order to keep electric rates stable.

Although popular with homeowners and the business community, Runyon&#x27;s cost-cutting included massive layoffs—more than 7,000 employees were let go on one day alone. The staff reductions earned him the sobriquet &quot;Carvin Marvin&quot; which inspired a satirical song played on local radio stations. Nationally he was celebrated by industry publications. In a &quot;Baron&#x27;s&quot; editorial article, his work was lauded: &quot;Three cheers for TVA: privatization could win it a coveted third&quot; 

The TVA Runyon left behind was much leaner, more focused, and had begun paying down its massive debt load. Some believe TVA would not have survived without the restructuring Runyon accomplished. But this new TVA was starkly different from the &quot;national laboratory&quot; Carter called on it to become in 1979. The TVA of 1933 run by engineers and bureaucratic experts was handed over to a financial class of managers who gained newfound status in the Reagan era. These managers had an often tenuous relationship with the Authority. 

==Postmaster General==
Runyon was appointed United States Postmaster General in 1992, at a time when the postal service was struggling with high costs and a poor reputation for service.

Runyon&#x27;s first goal was to treat the United States Postal Service as a business geared toward making money and pleasing customers. He was a cost control expert and instituted cost measurement systems copied from his years with Ford—he even sent senior post office officials to Ford to review their systems. He eliminated 23,000 management jobs, hired more letter carriers and counter employees and emphasized automation to speed mail delivery.

Runyon, during his time at the United States Postal Service, often decided to distance himself from management when he traveled. He normally made it a high priority to visit Postal Service craft employees (letter carriers, clerks, mailhandlers, etc.) in their work areas. It was not uncommon for him to sit alone in the coach section of an airplane, reading fiction.

He stepped down in 1998, the year in which he oversaw the introduction of electronically distributed franks.

==Retirement==

After leaving the United States Postal Service, Runyon started an independent consulting business in Tennessee, which he operated until his death. He also taught business at Middle Tennessee State University. In 1999, he was inducted into Woodrow Wilson High School&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

<text>Arizona is a state located in the Western United States. According to the 2020 United States census, Arizona is the 14th most populous state with 7,151,502 inhabitants (as of the 2020 census) and the 6th largest by land area spanning . Arizona is divided into 15 counties and contains 90 incorporated cities and towns. Incorporated places in Arizona are those that have been granted home rule, possessing a local government in the form of a city or town council. Most of the population is concentrated within the Phoenix metropolitan area, with a 2020 census population of 4,845,832 ( of the state population).

Phoenix is the capital and largest city by population in Arizona with 1,608,139 residents, is ranked as the fifth most populous city in the United States, and land area spanning as of the 2020 census. The smallest municipality by population and land area is Winkelman with 296 residents in . The oldest incorporated place in Arizona is Tucson which incorporated in 1877 and the most recent was the town of Tusayan which incorporated in March 2010.

==Municipal incorporation==
The Arizona Constitution has, since its ratification in 1912, allowed for the creation of municipal corporations in any community with a population of 3,500 or greater. According to the Constitution, a municipal charter cannot be created by special laws or by the legislature, but rather by the communities themselves as provided by general law. The population limit specified by the constitution was lowered by state law to a minimum of population of 1,500 for most locations, and further reduced to 500 for communities located within of a national park or national monument. State law further restricts the incorporation of new municipalities within urbanized areas, which are defined as a specific buffer zone surrounding existing cities and towns.

State law allows for the incorporation of a community as either a city or a town; the only additional requirement to incorporate as a city is a minimum population of 3,000. Cities and towns in Arizona function largely in an identical manner, but cities are provided with additional powers that a town charter does not provide, limited primarily to certain powers regarding the regulation of utilities and construction within the city limits. State law allows adjoining towns to merge and it allows a city to annex a town, but it does not allow cities to merge. Additionally, a town may change its form of government to a city upon reaching the minimum population of 3,000. There are, however, large communities that have remained incorporated as a town in spite of attaining a large population; Gilbert, with 267,918 residents, remains incorporated as a town.

Twenty Arizona municipalities were incorporated before 1912, when the state was admitted to the Union. As such, these cities and towns were incorporated by means other than those stipulated by current state law and the constitution. Phoenix, for example, was incorporated in 1881 by an act of the Territorial Legislature.

<doc id="730207" wikidata="Q2849609" url="?curid=730207" title="Boston accent">
<text>A Boston accent is a local accent of Eastern New England English, native specifically to the city of Boston and its suburbs. Northeastern New England English is classified as traditionally including New Hampshire, Maine, and all of eastern Massachusetts, while some uniquely local vocabulary appears only around Boston. A 2006 study co-authored by William Labov claims that the accent remains relatively stable, though a 2018 study suggests the accent&#x27;s traditional features may be retreating, particularly among the city&#x27;s younger residents, and becoming increasingly confined to the historically Irish-American neighborhood of South Boston.

==Phonological characteristics==
Boston accents typically have the cot-caught merger but not the father-bother merger. This means that instead of merging the historical &quot;short &quot;o&quot;&quot; sound (as in ) with the &quot;broad &quot;a&quot;&quot; (as in ) like most other American accents, the Boston accent merges it with the &quot;aw&quot; vowel (as in ). Thus, &quot;lot&quot;, &quot;paw&quot;, &quot;caught&quot;, &quot;cot&quot;, &quot;law&quot;, &quot;wand&quot;, &quot;rock&quot;, &quot;talk&quot;, &quot;doll&quot;, &quot;wall&quot;, etc. all are pronounced with the same open back (often) rounded vowel , while keeping the broad &quot;a&quot; sound distinct: , as in &quot;father&quot;, &quot;spa&quot;, and &quot;dark&quot;. So, even though the word &quot;dark&quot; has no in many Boston accents, it remains pronounced differently from &quot;dock&quot; because it belongs to Boston&#x27;s – class of words versus the – one: &quot;dark&quot; versus &quot;dock&quot; . Thus, while New York accents have for &quot;paw&quot; and for &quot;lot&quot;, and Standard British accents have a similar distinction ( versus ), Boston accents only have one merged phoneme for both: .

In general, Eastern New England accents have a &quot;short &quot;a&quot;&quot; vowel , as in , that is extremely tensed towards when it precedes a nasal consonant; thus, &quot;man&quot; is and &quot;planet&quot; is . Boston shares this system with some of the American Midwest and most of the West, though the raising in Boston tends to be more extreme. This type of modern General American -raising system is simpler than the systems of British or New York City accents. However, elements of a more complex pattern exist for some Boston speakers; in addition to raising before nasals, Bostonians (unlike nearby New Hampshirites, for example) may also &quot;raise&quot; or &quot;break&quot; the &quot;short &quot;a&quot;&quot; sound before other types of consonants too: primarily the most strongly before voiceless fricatives, followed by voiced stops, laterals, voiceless stops, and voiced fricatives, so that words like &quot;half&quot;, &quot;bath&quot;, and &quot;glass&quot; become , and , respectively. This trend began around the early-mid to mid-twentieth century, replacing the older Boston accent&#x27;s London-like &quot;broad &quot;a&quot;&quot; system, in which those same words are transferred over to the class . The raised may overlap with the non-rhotic realization of as .

Boston accents make a greater variety of distinctions between short and long vowels before medial than many other modern American accents do: &quot;hurry&quot; and &quot;furry&quot; ; and &quot;mirror&quot; and &quot;nearer&quot; , though some of these distinctions are somewhat endangered as people under 40 in neighboring New Hampshire and Maine have lost them. In this case, Boston shares these distinctions with both New York and British accents, whereas other American accents, like in the Midwest, have lost them entirely.

The nuclei of the diphthongs and ( and . respectively) may be raised to something like before voiceless consonants: thus &quot;write&quot; has a higher vowel than &quot;ride&quot; and &quot;lout&quot; has a higher vowel than &quot;loud&quot;. This phenomenon, more famously associated with Canadian accents, is known by linguists as Canadian raising.

The nuclei of and (in and ) are significantly less fronted than in many other American accents. The latter may be diphthongized to or .

The weak vowel merger is traditionally absent. This makes &quot;Lenin&quot; distinct from &quot;Lennon&quot; .

Speakers of the more deeply urban varieties of the Boston accent may realize the English dental fricatives as the dental stops , giving rise to a phonemic distinction between dental and alveolar stops; thus, &quot;those&quot; may sound closer to &quot;doze&quot;.

===Non-rhoticity===
The traditional Boston accent is widely known for being non-rhotic (or &quot;&quot;r&quot;-dropping&quot;), particularly before the mid-20th century. Recent studies have shown that younger speakers use more of a rhotic (or &quot;r&quot;-ful) accent than older speakers. This goes for black Bostonians as well. Non-rhoticity means that the phoneme does not appear in coda position , as in most dialects of English in England and Australia; &quot;card&quot; therefore becomes &quot;cahd&quot; and &quot;color&quot; &quot;culluh&quot;. Words such as &quot;weird&quot; and &quot;square&quot; feature centering diphthongs, which correspond to the sequences of close and mid vowels + in rhotic AmE. The phonemicity of the centering diphthongs depends on a speaker&#x27;s rhoticity. Also, the stressed sequence inside a closed syllable, as in , is most likely to take on a rhotic pronunciation among Bostonians.

A famous example of non-rhoticity (plus a fronted vowel) is &quot;Park your car in Harvard Yard&quot;, pronounced , or as if spelled &quot;pahk yah cah(r) in Hahvud Yahd&quot;. The &quot;r&quot; in &quot;car&quot; would usually be pronounced in this case, because the Boston accent possesses both linking R and intrusive R: an will not be lost at the end of a word if the next word begins with a vowel, and an will be inserted after a word ending with a central or low vowel if the next word begins with a vowel: &quot;the tuner is&quot; and &quot;the tuna is&quot; are both . This example has been used since at least 1946, to the point where some locals find requests to say the phrase annoying. Actual parking in Harvard Yard is prohibited, except by permission in rare cases for loading and unloading, contractors, or people needing accessible transport directly to Harvard Memorial Church.

===Declining features===
Many characteristics of the Boston accent may be retreating, particularly among younger residents. In the most old-fashioned of Boston accents, there may be a lingering resistance to the horse–hoarse merger, so that &quot;horse&quot; has the pure vowel , while &quot;hoarse&quot; has the centering diphthong ; this can potentially cause the –– merger, so that &quot;tort&quot;, &quot;tot&quot; and &quot;taught&quot; are phonemically all . The result is that, for an older Boston accent, the –– vowel is distinct from the vowel. Another two example words that would traditionally be distinguished, thus, are &quot;for&quot; versus &quot;four&quot; . This distinction was rapidly fading out of currency in the second half of the 20th century with the words belonging to the class being transferred over to the class, undoing the merger of with –, as it is in almost all regions of North America that still make it. For non-rhotic speakers, the modern-day situation in Boston is that both &quot;horse&quot; and &quot;hoarse&quot;, as well as both &quot;for&quot; and &quot;four&quot;, take the centering diphthong .

A feature that Boston speakers once shared with Britain&#x27;s Received Pronunciation, though now uncommon in Boston, is the &quot;broad &quot;a&quot;&quot; of the lexical set of words, making a distinction from the set (). In particular words that in other American accents have the &quot;short &quot;a&quot;&quot; pronounced as , that vowel was replaced in the nineteenth century (if not earlier and often sporadically by speakers as far back as the late eighteenth century) with : thus, &quot;half&quot; as and &quot;bath&quot; as . Fewer words have the broad &quot;a&quot; in Boston English than in the London accents, and fewer and fewer Boston speakers maintain the broad &quot;a&quot; system as time goes on, with its transition into a decline first occurring in speakers born from about 1930 to 1950 (and first documented as a decline in 1977). Boston speakers born before about 1930 used this broad &quot;a&quot; in &quot;after&quot;, &quot;ask&quot;, &quot;aunt&quot;, &quot;bath&quot;, &quot;calf&quot;, &quot;can&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;glass&quot;, &quot;half&quot;, &quot;laugh&quot;, &quot;pasture&quot;, &quot;path&quot;, and other words, while those born from about 1930 to 1950 normally use it only in &quot;aunt&quot;, &quot;calf&quot;, &quot;half&quot;, &quot;laugh&quot;, and &quot;pass&quot;. Speakers born since 1950 typically have no broad &quot;a&quot; whatsoever and, instead, slight /æ/ raising (i.e. in &quot;craft&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;math&quot;, etc.) with this same set of words and, variably, other instances of short &quot;a&quot; too. Only &quot;aunt&quot; maintains the broad &quot;a&quot; sound in even the youngest speakers, though this one word is a common exception throughout all of the Northeastern U.S. Broad &quot;a&quot; in &quot;aunt&quot; is also heard by occasional speakers throughout Anglophone North America; it is quite commonly heard in African American speech as well.

==In popular culture==
Although not all Boston-area speakers are non-rhotic, non-rhoticity remains the feature most widely associated with the region. As a result, it is frequently the subject of humor about Boston, as in comedian Jon Stewart joking in his book &quot;America&quot; that, although John Adams drafted the 1780 Massachusetts Constitution, &quot;delegates from his state refused to ratify the letter &#x27;R&#x27;&quot;.

Being conspicuous and easily identifiable as regional, Boston accents are routinely featured by actors in films set in Boston, particularly for working-class white characters, such as in &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, &quot;Mystic River&quot;, &quot;The Departed&quot;, &quot;Manchester by the Sea&quot;, &quot;The Town&quot;, &quot;Ted&quot;, &quot;The Fighter&quot;, and &quot;Black Mass&quot;. Television series based within a Boston setting such as &quot;Boston Public&quot; and &quot;Cheers&quot; have featured the accent. &quot;Simpsons&quot; character Mayor Quimby talks with an exaggerated Boston accent as a reference to the former US Senator Ted Kennedy. Television comedy sketches have featured the accent, including &quot;The Boston Teens&quot; and &quot;Dunkin Donuts&quot; on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, as well as &quot;Boston Accent Trailer&quot; on &quot;Late Night with Seth Meyers&quot;.

In &quot;The Heat&quot;, the family members of Shannon Mullins all speak with the Boston accent, and confusion arises from the pronunciation of the word &quot;narc&quot; as &quot;nahk&quot; . In the video game &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;, the character Scout, who is a Boston native himself, talks with a distinct Boston accent, although it sometimes lapses into a Brooklyn accent.

<text>is a Buddhist temple of the Jōdo-shū sect in the city of Kamakura in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. Its mountain name is , and its common temple name is .

The temple is renowned for , a monumental outdoor bronze statue of Amitābha, which is one of the most famous icons of Japan. It is also a designated National Treasure, and one of the twenty-two historic sites included in Kamakura&#x27;s proposal for inclusion in UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Sites.

== Statue ==
 is a large bronze statue of Amitābha, located on the temple grounds. Including the base, it measures tall and weighs approximately . According to temple records, the statue dates from around 1252, during the Kamakura period, which it is named after.

The statue is hollow, and visitors can view the interior. Many visitors have left graffiti on the inside of the statue. At one time, there were thirty-two bronze lotus petals at the base of the statue, but only four remain, and they are no longer in place. A notice at the entrance to the grounds reads, &quot;Stranger, whosoever thou art and whatsoever be thy creed, when thou enterest this sanctuary remember thou treadest upon ground hallowed by the worship of ages. This is the Temple of Buddha and the gate of the eternal, and should therefore be entered with reverence.&quot;

=== History ===

The current bronze statue was preceded by a giant wooden Buddha, which was completed in 1243 after ten years of continuous labor, the funds having been raised by Lady Inada no Tsubone and the Buddhist priest Jōkō of Tōtōmi. The wooden statue was damaged by a storm in 1248, and the hall containing it was destroyed, so Jōkō suggested making a new statue of bronze, and the huge amount of money necessary for this and a new hall was raised for the project. The bronze image was probably cast by Ōno Gorōemon or Tanji Hisatomo, both leading casters of the time. At one time, the statue was gilded. There are still traces of gold leaf near the statue&#x27;s ears.

The hall was destroyed by a storm in 1334, was rebuilt, was damaged by yet another storm in 1369, and was rebuilt yet again. The last building housing the statue was washed away in the tsunami resulting from the Nankai earthquake of 20 September 1498, during the Muromachi period. Since then, the Great Buddha has stood in the open air.

The 1923 Great Kantō earthquake destroyed the base the statue sits upon, but the base was repaired in 1925. Repairs to the statue were carried out in 1960–61, when the neck was strengthened and measures were taken to protect it from earthquakes. In early 2016, further research, restoration, and preservation work was performed on the statue.

The verses were taken from the poem of the same name the author wrote after visiting Kamakura in 1892. The poem appears in its entirety in Kipling&#x27;s poetry collection &quot;The Five Nations&quot; of 1903.

<doc id="730219" wikidata="Q12946749" url="?curid=730219" title="Bathing">
<text>Bathing is the immersion of the body, wholly or partially, usually in water, but often in another medium such as hot air. It is most commonly practised as part of personal cleansing, and less frequently for relaxation or as a leisure activity. Cleansing the body may be solely a component of personal hygiene, but is also a spiritual part of some religious rituals. Bathing is also sometimes used medically or therapeutically, as in hydrotherapy, ice baths, or the mud bath. 

People bathe in water at temperatures ranging from very cold to very hot, or in appropriately heated air, according to custom or purpose.

Where indoor heated water is available, people bathe more or less daily, at comfortable temperatures, in a private bathtub or shower. Communal bathing, such as that in hammams, sauna, banya, Victorian Turkish baths, and sentō, fulfils the same purpose, in addition to its often having a social function.

Ritual religious bathing is sometimes referred to as immersion. This can be required after sexual intercourse or menstruation (Islam and Judaism), or as baptism (Christianity).

By analogy, the term &quot;bathing&quot; is also applied to relaxing activities in which the participant &quot;bathes&quot; in the rays of the sun (sunbathing) or in outdoor bodies of water, such as in sea bathing or wild swimming.

Although there is sometimes overlap, as in sea bathing, most bathing is usually treated as distinct from more active recreations like swimming. 

==History==

=== Ancient world ===
Bathing in Ancient China may be traced back to the Shang Dynasty, 3000 years ago (1600–1046 BCE). Archaeological findings from the Yinxu ruins show a cauldron to boil water, smaller cauldrons to draw out the water to be poured into a basin, skin scrapers to remove dirt and dead skin. 2300 year old lavish imperial bathrooms with exquisite tiles and a sewage system can be seen in Xi&#x27;an. Bathing grew in importance in the Han Dynasty (202 BC–AD 220) where officials were allowed to take a day&#x27;s leave for bathing at home every five days, and bathing became the reason for a bank holiday for the first time.

An accountable daily ritual of bathing can be traced to the ancient Indians. They used elaborate practices for personal hygiene with three daily baths and washing. These are recorded in the works called &quot;grihya sutras&quot; which date back to 500 BCE and are in practice today in some communities. In Hinduism, “&quot;Prataha Kaal&quot;” (the onset of day) or “&quot;Brahma Muhoortham&quot;” begins with the 4 am “&quot;snanam&quot;” or bath, and was considered extremely auspicious in ancient times.
Ancient Greece utilized small bathtubs, wash basins, and foot baths for personal cleanliness. The earliest findings of baths date from the mid-2nd millennium BC in the palace complex at Knossos, Crete, and the luxurious alabaster bathtubs excavated in Akrotiri, Santorini. A word for bathtub, (), occurs eleven times in Homer. As a legitimate Mycenaean word (a-sa-mi-to) for a kind of vessel that could be found in any Mycenaean palace, this Linear B term derives from an Aegean suffix &quot;-inth-&quot; being appended to an Akkadian loan word with the root &quot;namsû&quot; (&#x27;washbowl&#x27;, &#x27;washing tub&#x27;). This luxurious item of the Mycenaean palace culture, therefore, was clearly borrowed from the Near East. Later Greeks established public baths and showers within gymnasiums for relaxation and personal hygiene. The word &quot;gymnasium&quot; (γυμνάσιον) comes from the Greek word &quot;gymnos&quot; (γυμνός), meaning &quot;naked&quot;.

Ancient Rome developed a network of aqueducts to supply water to all large towns and population centers and had indoor plumbing, with pipes that terminated in homes and at public wells and fountains. The Roman public baths were called thermae. The thermae were not simply baths, but important public works that provided facilities for many kinds of physical exercise and ablutions, with cold, warm, and hot baths, rooms for instruction and debate, and usually one Greek and one Latin library. They also represented an important moment of socialization and exchange between the members of the community. They were provided for the public by a benefactor, usually the Emperor. Other empires of the time did not show such an affinity for public works, but this Roman practice spread their culture to places where there may have been more resistance to foreign mores. Unusually for the time, the thermae were not class-stratified, being available to all for no charge or a small fee. With the fall of the Roman Empire, the aqueduct system fell into disrepair and disuse. But even before that, during the Christianization of the Empire, changing ideas about public morals led the baths into disfavor.

===Medieval Japan===
Before the 7th century, the Japanese were likely to have bathed in the many springs in the open, as there is no evidence of closed rooms. In the 6th to 8th centuries (in the Asuka and Nara periods) the Japanese absorbed the religion of Buddhism from China, which had a strong impact on the culture of the entire country. Buddhist temples traditionally included a bathhouse (&quot;yuya&quot;) for the monks. Due to the principle of purity espoused by Buddhism these baths were eventually opened to the public. Only the wealthy had private baths.

The first public bathhouse was mentioned in 1266. In Edo (modern Tokyo), the first &quot;sentō&quot; was established in 1591. The early steam baths were called &quot;iwaburo&quot; ( &quot;rock pools&quot;) or &quot;kamaburo&quot; ( &quot;furnace baths&quot;). These were built into natural caves or stone vaults. In &quot;iwaburo&quot; along the coast, the rocks were heated by burning wood, then sea water was poured over the rocks, producing steam. The entrances to these &quot;bath houses&quot; were very small, possibly to slow the escape of the heat and steam. There were no windows, so it was very dark inside and the user constantly coughed or cleared their throats in order to signal to new entrants which seats were already occupied. The darkness could be also used to cover sexual contact. Because there was no gender distinction, these baths came into disrepute. They were finally abolished in 1870 on hygienic and moral grounds. Author John Gallagher says bathing &quot;was segregated in the 1870s as a concession to outraged Western tourists&quot;.

At the beginning of the Edo period (1603–1868) there were two different types of baths. In Edo, hot-water baths (&#x27; &#x27;) were common, while in Osaka, steam baths ( &#x27;) were common. At that time shared bathrooms for men and women were the rule. These bathhouses were very popular, especially for men. &quot;Bathing girls&quot; ( &quot;&quot;) were employed to scrub the guests&#x27; backs and wash their hair, etc. In 1841, the employment of &quot;yuna&quot; was generally prohibited, as well as mixed bathing. The segregation of the sexes, however, was often ignored by operators of bathhouses, or areas for men and women were separated only by a symbolic line. Today, &quot;sento&quot; baths have separate rooms for men and women.

===Mesoamerica===

Spanish chronicles describe the bathing habits of the peoples of Mesoamerica during and after the conquest.
Bernal Díaz del Castillo describes Moctezuma (the Mexica, or Aztec, king at the arrival of Cortés) in his &quot;Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España&quot; as being &quot;...Very neat and cleanly, bathing every day each afternoon...&quot;.
Bathing was not restricted to the elite, but was practised by all people; the chronicler Tomás López Medel wrote after a journey to Central America that &quot;Bathing and the custom of washing oneself is so quotidian (common) amongst the Indians, both of cold and hot lands, as is eating, and this is done in fountains and rivers and other water to which they have access, without anything other than pure water...&quot;

The Mesoamerican bath, known as &quot;temazcal&quot; in Spanish, from the Nahuatl word &quot;temazcalli&quot;, a compound of &quot;temaz&quot; (&quot;steam&quot;) and &quot;calli&quot; (&quot;house&quot;), consists of a room, often in the form of a small dome, with an exterior firebox known as &quot;texictle&quot; (teʃict͜ɬe) that heats a small portion of the room&#x27;s wall made of volcanic rocks; after this wall has been heated, water is poured on it to produce steam, an action known as &quot;tlasas&quot;. As the steam accumulates in the upper part of the room a person in charge uses a bough to direct the steam to the bathers who are lying on the ground, with which he later gives them a massage, then the bathers scrub themselves with a small flat river stone and finally the person in charge introduces buckets with water with soap and grass used to rinse. This bath had also ritual importance, and was vinculated to the goddess Toci; it is also therapeutic when medicinal herbs are used in the water for the &quot;tlasas&quot;. It is still used in Mexico.

===Medieval and early-modern Europe===

Christianity has always placed a strong emphasis on hygiene. Despite the denunciation of the mixed bathing style of Roman pools by early Christian clergy, as well as the pagan custom of women bathing naked in front of men, this did not stop the Church from urging its followers to go to public baths for bathing, which contributed to hygiene and good health according to the Church Fathers, Clement of Alexandria and Tertullian. The Church also built public bathing facilities that were separate for both sexes near monasteries and pilgrimage sites; also, the popes situated baths within church basilicas and monasteries since the early Middle Ages. Pope Gregory the Great urged his followers on the value of bathing as a bodily need.

Great bathhouses were built in Byzantine centers such as Constantinople and Antioch, and the popes allocated to the Romans bathing through &quot;diaconia&quot;, or private Lateran baths, or even a myriad of monastic bath houses functioning in the eighth and ninth centuries. The Popes maintained baths in their residences which were described by scholar Paolo Squatriti as &quot;luxurious baths&quot;, and bath houses including hot baths were incorporated into Christian Church buildings or those of monasteries, which were known as &quot;charity baths&quot; because they served both the clerics and needy poor people. Public bathing was common in larger towns and cities such as Paris, Regensburg and Naples. The Catholic religious orders of the Augustinians and Benedictines had rules for ritual purification, and inspired by Benedict of Nursia encouraged the practice of therapeutic bathing; Benedictine monks played a role in the development and promotion of spas. Protestantism also played a prominent role in the development of the British spas.

In the Middle Ages, bathing commonly took place in public bathhouses. Public baths were also havens for prostitution, which created some opposition to them. Rich people bathed at home, most likely in their bedroom, as &quot;bath&quot; rooms were not common. Bathing was done in large, wooden tubs with a linen cloth laid in it to protect the bather from splinters. Additionally, during the Renaissance and Protestant Reformation, the quality and condition of the clothing (as opposed to the actual cleanliness of the body itself) were thought to reflect the soul of an individual. Clean clothing also reflected one&#x27;s social status; clothes made the man or woman.

Due to Black Death plague, introduced from Asia to Europe, public baths were closed to avoid contagion. In the sixteenth century, the popularity of public bathhouses in Europe sharply declined, perhaps due to the new plague of syphilis which made sexual promiscuity more risky, or stronger religious prohibitions on nudity surrounding the Protestant Reformation. Some Europeans came to believe the false idea that bathing or steaming would open pores to disease.

===Modern era===

====Therapeutic bathing====
Public opinion about bathing began to shift in the middle and late 18th century, when writers argued that frequent bathing might lead to better health. Two English works on the medical uses of water were published in the 18th century that inaugurated the new fashion for therapeutic bathing. One of these was by Sir John Floyer, a physician of Lichfield, who, struck by the remedial use of certain springs by the neighbouring peasantry, investigated the history of cold bathing and published a book on the subject in 1702.
 The book ran through six editions within a few years and the translation of this book into German was largely drawn upon by Dr J. S. Hahn of Silesia as the basis for his book called &quot;On the Healing Virtues of Cold Water, Inwardly and Outwardly Applied, as Proved by Experience&quot;, published in 1738.

The other work was a 1797 publication by Dr James Currie of Liverpool on the use of hot and cold water in the treatment of fever and other illness, with a fourth edition published not long before his death in 1805. It was also translated into German by Michaelis (1801) and Hegewisch (1807). It was highly popular and first placed the subject on a scientific basis. Hahn&#x27;s writings had meanwhile created much enthusiasm among his countrymen, societies having been everywhere formed to promote the medicinal and dietetic use of water; in 1804 Professor E.F.C. Oertel of Anspach republished them and quickened the popular movement by the unqualified commendation of water drinking as a remedy for all diseases.
A popular revival followed the application of hydrotherapy around 1829, by Vincenz Priessnitz, a peasant farmer in Gräfenberg, then part of the Austrian Empire.
 This revival was continued by a Bavarian priest, Sebastian Kneipp (1821–1897), &quot;an able and enthusiastic follower&quot; of Priessnitz, &quot;whose work he took up where Priessnitz left it&quot;, after he read a treatise on the cold water cure. In Wörishofen (south Germany), Kneipp developed the systematic and controlled application of hydrotherapy for the support of medical treatment that was delivered only by doctors at that time. Kneipp&#x27;s own book &quot;My Water Cure&quot; was published in 1886 with many subsequent editions, and translated into many languages.

Captain R. T. Claridge was responsible for introducing and promoting hydropathy in Britain, first in London in 1842, then with lecture tours in Ireland and Scotland in 1843. His 10-week tour in Ireland included Limerick, Cork, Wexford, Dublin and Belfast, over June, July and August 1843, with two subsequent lectures in Glasgow.

The acceptance of germ theory in the late 1800s provided scientific reasons for frequent bathing.

====Public baths and wash-houses====

Large public baths such as those found in the ancient world and the Ottoman Empire were revived during the 19th century. The first modern public baths were opened in Liverpool in 1829. The first known warm fresh-water public wash house was opened in May 1842.

The popularity of wash-houses was spurred by the newspaper interest in Kitty Wilkinson, an Irish immigrant &quot;wife of a labourer&quot; who became known as the &quot;Saint of the Slums&quot;. In 1832, during a cholera epidemic, Wilkinson took the initiative to offer the use of her house and yard to neighbours to wash their clothes, at a charge of a penny per week, and showed them how to use a chloride of lime (bleach) to get them clean. She was supported by the District Provident Society and William Rathbone. In 1842, Wilkinson was appointed baths superintendent.

In Birmingham, around ten private baths were available in the 1830s. Whilst the dimensions of the baths were small, they provided a range of services. A major proprietor of bath houses in Birmingham was a Mr. Monro who had had premises in Lady Well and Snow Hill. Private baths were advertised as having healing qualities and being able to cure people of diabetes, gout and all skin diseases, amongst others. On 19 November 1844, it was decided that the working class members of society should have the opportunity to access baths, in an attempt to address the health problems of the public. On 22 April and 23 April 1845, two lectures were delivered in the town hall urging the provision of public baths in Birmingham and other towns and cities.

After a period of campaigning by many committees, the Public Baths and Wash-houses Act received royal assent on 26 August 1846. The act empowered local authorities across the country to incur expenditure in constructing public swimming baths out of its own funds.

The first London public baths was opened at Goulston Square, Whitechapel, in 1847 with the Prince consort laying the foundation stone.

====Soap promoted for personal cleanliness====

By the mid-19th century, the English urbanised middle classes had formed an ideology of cleanliness that ranked alongside typical Victorian concepts, such as Christianity, respectability and social progress. The cleanliness of the individual became associated with his or her moral and social standing within the community and domestic life became increasingly regulated by concerns regarding the presentation of domestic sobriety and cleanliness.
The industry of soapmaking began on a small scale in the 1780s, with the establishment of a soap manufactory at Tipton by James Keir and the marketing of high-quality, transparent soap in 1789 by Andrew Pears of London. In 1807, Pears found a way of removing the impurities and refining the base soap before adding the delicate perfume of garden flowers, founding Pears soap. It was in the mid-19th century, though, that the large-scale consumption of soap by the middle classes, anxious to prove their social standing, drove forward the mass production and marketing of soap. 
William Gossage produced low-priced, good-quality soap from the 1850s. William Hesketh Lever and his brother, James, bought a small soap works in Warrington in 1886 and founded what is still one of the largest soap businesses, formerly called Lever Brothers and now called Unilever. These soap businesses were among the first to employ large-scale advertising campaigns. In 1882, English actress and socialite Lillie Langtry became the poster-girl for Pears soap, and thus the first celebrity to endorse a commercial product.

Before the late 19th century, water to individual places of residence was rare. Many countries in Europe developed a water collection and distribution network. London water supply infrastructure developed through major 19th-century treatment works built in response to cholera threats, to modern large-scale reservoirs. By the end of the century, private baths with running hot water were increasingly common in affluent homes in America and Britain.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a weekly Saturday night bath had become common custom for most of the population. A half day&#x27;s work on Saturday for factory workers allowed them some leisure to prepare for the Sunday day of rest. The half day off allowed time for the considerable labor of drawing, carrying, and heating water, filling the bath and then afterward emptying it. To economize, bath water was shared by all family members. Indoor plumbing became more common in the 20th century and commercial advertising campaigns pushing new bath products began to influence public ideas about cleanliness, promoting the idea of a daily shower or bath.

In the twenty-first century challenges to the need for soap to effect such everyday cleanliness and whether soap is needed to avoid body odor, appeared in media.

===Hot-air baths===
====Hammam====

A hammam is a type of steam bath or a place of public bathing associated with the Islamic world. It is a prominent feature in the culture of the Muslim world and was inherited from the model of the Roman &quot;thermae.&quot; Muslim bathhouses or hammams were historically found across the Middle East, North Africa, al-Andalus (Islamic Spain and Portugal), Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and in Southeastern Europe under Ottoman rule.

In Islamic cultures the significance of the hammam was both religious and civic: it provided for the needs of ritual ablutions but also provided for general hygiene in an era before private plumbing and served other social functions such as offering a gendered meeting place for men and for women. Archeological remains attest to the existence of bathhouses in the Islamic world as early as the Umayyad period (7th–8th centuries) and their importance has persisted up to modern times. Their architecture evolved from the layout of Roman and Greek bathhouses and featured a regular sequence of rooms: an undressing room, a cold room, a warm room, and a hot room. Heat was produced by furnaces which provided hot water and steam, while smoke and hot air was channeled through conduits under the floor.

In a modern hammam visitors undress themselves, while retaining some sort of modesty garment or loincloth, and proceed into progressively hotter rooms, inducing perspiration. They are then usually washed by male or female staff (matching the gender of the visitor) with the use of soap and vigorous rubbing, before ending by washing themselves in warm water. Unlike in Roman or Greek baths, bathers usually wash themselves with running water instead of immersing themselves in standing water since this is a requirement of Islam, though immersion in a pool used to be customary in the hammams of some regions such as Iran. While hammams everywhere generally operate in fairly similar ways, there are some regional differences both in usage and architecture.

====Victorian Turkish baths====
Victorian Turkish baths (inspired by the traditional Islamic bathhouse—the hammam—itself an adaptation of the ancient Roman baths) were introduced to Britain by David Urquhart, diplomat and sometime Member of Parliament for Stafford. He wanted, for political and personal reasons, to popularize Turkish culture in Britain. In 1850 he wrote &quot;The Pillars of Hercules&quot;, a book about his travels in 1848 through Spain and Morocco. He described the vaporous hot-air baths (little-changed since Roman times) which he visited, both there and in the Ottoman Empire. In 1856 Dr Richard Barter read Urquhart&#x27;s book and worked with him to construct such a bath, intending to use it at his hydropathic establishment at St Ann(e)&#x27;s Hill, near Blarney, County Cork, Ireland. Barter realised that the human body could tolerate the more therapeutically effective higher temperatures in hot air which was dry rather than steamy. After a number of unsuccessful attempts, he opened the first modern bath of this type in 1856. He called it the &quot;Improved&quot; Turkish or Irish bath, now better known as the Victorian Turkish bath.

The following year, the first public bath of its type to be built in mainland Britain since Roman times was opened in Manchester, and the idea spread rapidly. It reached London in July 1860, when Roger Evans, a member of one of Urquhart&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Committees, opened a Turkish bath at 5 Bell Street, near Marble Arch. During the following 150 years, over 700 Turkish baths opened in the British Isles, including those built by municipal authorities as part of swimming pool complexes. It was claimed by Durham Dunlop (and many others) that hot-air bathing was a more effective body-cleanser than water, while Richard Metcalfe meticulously calculated that it would be more cost-effective for local authorities to provide hot-air baths in place of slipper baths. 

Turkish baths opened in other parts of the British Empire. Dr. John Le Gay Brereton opened one in Sydney, Australia in 1859, Canada had one by 1869, and the first in New Zealand was opened in 1874. Urquhart&#x27;s influence was also felt outside the Empire when in 1861, Dr Charles H. Shepard opened the first Turkish baths in the United States at 63 Columbia Street, Brooklyn Heights, New York, most probably on 3 October 1863.

==Purpose==
One purpose of bathing is for personal hygiene. It is a means of achieving cleanliness by washing away dead skin cells, dirt, and soil and as a preventative measure to reduce the incidence and spread of disease. It also may reduce body odors, however, some people note that may not be so necessary as commonly thought.

Bathing creates a feeling of well-being and the physical appearance of cleanliness.

Bathing may also be practised for religious ritual or therapeutic purposes or as a recreational activity. Bathing may be used to cool or to warm the body of an individual.

Therapeutic use of bathing includes hydrotherapy, healing, rehabilitation from injury or addiction, and relaxation.

The use of a bath in religious ritual or ceremonial rites include immersion during baptism in Christianity and to achieve a state of ritual cleanliness in a &quot;mikvah&quot; in Judaism. It is referred to as &quot;Ghusl&quot; in Arabic to attain ceremonial purity (&quot;Taahir&quot;) in Islam. All major religions place an emphasis on ceremonial purity, and bathing is one of the primary means of attaining outward purity. In Hindu households, any acts of defilement are countered by undergoing a bath and Hindus also immerse in Sarovar as part of religious rites. In the Sikh religion, there is a place at Golden Temple where the leprosy of Rajni&#x27;s husband was cured by immersion into the holy sacred pool, and many pilgrims bathe in the sacred pool believing it will cure their illness as well.

==Types of baths==

Where bathing is for personal hygiene, bathing in a bathtub or shower is the most common form of bathing in Western, and many Eastern, countries. People most commonly bathe in their home or use a private bath in a public bathhouse. In some societies, bathing can take place in rivers, creeks, lakes or water holes, or any other place where there is an adequate pool of water. The quality of water used for bathing purposes varies considerably. Normally bathing involves use of soap or a soap-like substance, such as shower gel. In southern India people more commonly use aromatic oil and other home-made body scrubs.

Bathing in public can also provide occasions for social interaction, such as in Turkish, banya, sauna, hammams, or whirlpool baths.

=== Sponge bath ===
When water is in short supply or a person is not fit to have a standing bath, a wet cloth or sponge can be used, or the person can wash by splashing water over their body. A sponge bath is usually conducted in hospitals, which involves one person washing another with a sponge, while the person being washed remains lying in bed.

===Ladling water from a container===

This method involves using a small container to scoop water out of a large container and pour water over the body, in such a way that this water does not go back into the large container.

In Indonesia and Malaysia, this is a traditional method referred to as &quot;mandi&quot;.

In the Indonesian language, &quot;mandi&quot; is the verb for this process; &quot;bak mandi&quot; is the large container, and &quot;kamar mandi&quot; is the place in which this is done. Travel guides often use the word &quot;mandi&quot; on its own or in various ways such as for the large container and for the process of bathing.

In the Philippines, &quot;timba&quot; (pail) and &quot;tabo&quot; (dipper) are two essentials in every bathroom.

=== Bathing babies ===
Babies can be washed in a kitchen sink or a small plastic baby bath, instead of using a standard bath which offers little control of the infant&#x27;s movements and requires the parent to lean awkwardly or kneel. Bathing infants too often has been linked to the development of asthma or severe eczema according to some researchers, including Michael Welch, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics&#x27; section on allergy and immunology. A safe temperature for the bathwater is generally held to be .

==Japanese bathing culture==

===Private baths===
Although baths at home had been prevalent to some extent since the Edo period (1603-1867), the common people usually went to public bathhouses during the first half of the Showa period (1926-1989), and only wealthy families had their own bathrooms. Home baths became commonplace since the period of rapid economic growth after World War II. Bath water in Japan is much hotter than what is usual in Central Europe. The temperature is usually well above . In medical literature, is considered bearable. The heat is considered a prerequisite for complete relaxation. The custom is to thoroughly clean oneself with soap and rinse before entering the tub, so as not to contaminate the bath water.

===Public baths===
In public baths, there is a distinction between public baths with natural hot springs (called , meaning &#x27;hot&#x27;), and those without natural hot springs (known as ). Since Japan is located in a volcanically active region, there are many hot springs, of which about 2,000 are swimming pools. Most are in the open countryside, but they are also found in cities. In Tokyo, for example, there are about 25 baths. &quot;Onsen&quot; are similar to Western-style spas in their therapeutic use of natural hot springs.

An consists mostly of outdoor pools (), which are sometimes at different temperatures. Extremely hot springs, where even experienced or frequent hot-spring bathers can only stay a few minutes, are called (&#x27;hell&#x27;). Many also have saunas, spa treatments and therapy centers. The same rules apply in public baths as in private baths, with bathers required to wash and clean themselves before entering the water. In general, the Japanese bathe naked in bathhouses; bathing suits are not permissible.

==Art motif==
Bathing scenes were already in the Middle Ages a popular subject of painters. Most of the subjects were women shown nude, but the interest was probably less to the bathing itself rather than to provide the context for representing the nude figure. From the Middle Ages, illustrated books of the time contained such bathing scenes. Biblical and mythological themes which featured bathing were depicted by numerous painters. Especially popular themes included Bathsheba in the bath, in which she is observed by King David, and Susanna in the sight of lecherous old men.

In the High Middle Ages, public baths were a popular subject of painting, with rather clear depictions of sexual advances, which probably were not based on actual observations. During the Renaissance and Baroque periods, the gods and nymphs of Greek mythology were depicted bathing in allegorical paintings by artists such as Titian and François Boucher, both of whom painted the goddess Diana bathing. Artists continued to paint Biblical characters bathing, and also sometimes depicted contemporary women bathing in the river, an example being Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot;Woman Bathing&quot;.

In the 19th century, the use of the bathing scene reached its high point in classicism, realism and impressionism. Oriental themes and harem and turkish baths scenes became popular. These scenes were based on the artists&#x27; imagination, because access by men to Islamic women was not generally permitted. In the second half of the century, artists increasingly eschewed the pretexts of mythology and exoticism, and painted contemporary western women bathing. Edgar Degas, for example, painted over 100 paintings with a bathing theme. The subject of Bathers remained popular in avant-garde circles at the outset of the 20th century.

<text>A gold gram is the amount of value represented by exactly one gram of gold. It is a unit of account frequently used for digital gold currencies. It is sometimes denoted by the symbol &quot;gg&quot;, &quot;AUG&quot;, or &quot;GAU&quot;.

A milligram of gold is sometimes referred to as a mil or mgg. Therefore, 1 AUG = 1 gg = 1000 mgg = 1000 mil, and 1 mil = 1 mgg = 0.001 gg = 0.001 AUG. This allows gold holdings and transfers to take place in tiny fractions of a gram (equivalent to a few cents).

A possible source of confusion is that gold is often priced on the open market in the more traditional troy ounce (one troy ounce is exactly 31.1034768 grams, which is larger than the avoirdupois ounce generally in use in the United States and has a mass of 28.35 grams). Kilogram gold prices are commonly used by the Zurich Gold Pool where 1,000 kilograms = one tonne.

<text>Digital gold currency (or DGC) is a form of electronic money (or digital currency) based on mass units of gold. It is a kind of representative money, like a US paper gold certificate at the time (from 1873 to 1933) that these were exchangeable for gold on demand. The typical unit of account for such currency is linked to grams or troy ounces of gold, although other units such as the gold dinar are sometimes used. DGCs are backed by gold through unallocated or allocated gold storage.

Digital gold currencies are issued by a number of companies, each of which provides a system that enables users to pay each other in units that hold the same value as gold bullion. These competing providers issue a type of independent currency. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is also issuing the ZiG, a digital token backed by gold, which has also been granted legal tender status.
==Features==
=== Universal currency ===
Proponents claim that DGC offers a truly global and borderless world currency system which is independent of exchange rate variations and political manipulation. Gold, silver, platinum and palladium each have recognized international currency codes under ISO 4217.

===Asset protection===
Unlike fractional-reserve banking, DGCs hold 100% of clients&#x27; funds in reserve as gold, silver, and/or platinum, which can be exchanged via digital certificates. Proponents of DGC systems say that deposits are protected against inflation, devaluation and other economic risks inherent in fiat currencies. These risks include the monetary policy of countries or territories, which are said by proponents to be harmful to the value of paper currency.

===Bullion investing===
 can be used to buy, hold, and sell precious metals, but do not promote themselves as an &quot;investment&quot;, as this implies an anticipated return.

=== Exchanging national currency ===
Some providers do not sell DGC directly to clients. For those DGCs, e-currency must be bought and sold via a digital currency exchanger.

Currency exchangers accept payment in national currencies by a variety of methods, including Bank Wire, Direct Deposit, Cheque, Money Order. Some exchangers also sell and fund pre-paid debit cards to make it easier for their clientele to convert DGC into an easily spendable form of national currency.

DGCs are known as private currency as they are not issued by governments.

=== Non-reversible transactions ===
Unlike the credit card industry, digital gold currency issuers generally do not have services to dispute or reverse charges. So, reversing transactions, even in case of a legitimate error, unauthorized use, or failure of a vendor to supply goods is difficult, if not impossible. This means that using digital gold currency is more akin to a cash transaction, while PayPal transfers, for example, could be considered more similar to credit card transactions.

The advantage of this agreement is that the operating costs of the digital currency system are significantly reduced because of the shortage of settlement of payment disputes. Plus, it allows to instantly clear digital gold currency transactions, making the funds immediately available to the recipient. Unlike credit cards, checks, ACH, and other reversible payment methods, there are typically 72 hours or more to clear.

==Risks==
As with all financial media, there are several types of risk inherent to the use of DGCs: management risk, political risk, data security and exchange risk.

===Management and political risks===
DGCs, like all financial institutions and public securities, have a layer of risk in the form of the management of the issuing institution. Controls aimed to limit management risk are called &quot;governance&quot;.

All other DGC providers operate under self-regulation. DGC providers are not banks and therefore not subject to many bank regulations that pertain to fractional reserve lending as they do not engage in lending. However, DGCs do provide a method for transferring currency from one person to another, and therefore may fall under regulations pertaining to money transmitting in various jurisdictions.

The Global Digital Currency Association (GDCA), which was founded in 2002, is a non-profit association of online currency operators, exchangers, merchants and users. The GDCA is an example of the DGC industry&#x27;s attempt at self-regulation. On their website they claim their goal is to &quot;further the interests of the industry as a whole and help with fighting fraud and other illegal activities, arbitrate disputes and act as escrow agent when and where required.&quot; Of the once DGC providers, Pecunix (gone, see below), Liberty Reserve (shut down for money laundering in 2013), and eight others became members of the association. It costs one gram of gold to file a complaint if you are not a member, and the list of filable complaints is not exhaustive. Their domain name is registered anonymously through domains by proxy, see whois.

====OS-Gold, Standard Reserve and INTGold====
Several companies claiming to be Digital Gold Currencies sprang up and failed between 1999 and 2004, such as OS-Gold, Standard Reserve and INTGold. All these companies failed because the principals diverted deposits for other purposes instead of holding them in the form of gold. In each of these cases, account holders lost several million dollars worth of gold when the &quot;institution&quot; failed.

====e-gold====

e-gold was a digital gold currency founded in 1996. A legal case was brought against e-gold in April 2007 that included violations of 18 U.S. Code § 1960 (Prohibition of unlicensed money transmitting businesses). e-gold vigorously contested the § 1960 charges brought against it in April 2007 for more than a year. In July 2008, following a ruling from the court that effectively enshrined in case law the Treasury Department&#x27;s expansion of the definition of &quot;money transmitter&quot;, e-gold entered into a plea agreement that detailed actions required to bring the companies into compliance with laws and regulations governing operation of a money transmitting business. Although e-gold complied with all other terms of its plea agreement, it was not able to obtain money transmitting licenses due to its guilty plea. Since returning value to customers could constitute money transmitting without a license, e-gold entered into an agreement in 2010 with the US Government to enable e-gold account holders to claim the &quot;monetized value&quot; of their accounts, collectively valued in excess of 90 million US Dollars.

====1mdc====

1mdc was a digital gold currency backed by e-gold rather than by physical gold. On 27 April 2007, a US court ordered e-gold to freeze or block the e-gold accounts 1mdc used to back the digital gold currency it issued. Before the year was out, the 1mdc website was no longer accessible.

====e-Bullion====

E-Bullion was a digital-gold currency exchange that had risen, then become defunct around 2008.

In August 2008, James Fayed, the owner and chief executive official of the E-Bullion Company, was taken into United States Federal custody to face felony charges of conducting unlicensed money transactions and the murder of his wife. Shortly thereafter, the website ceased to be available. As a consequence of these charges, by January 2010 the U.S. Government had seized all of the assets of e-Bullion, resulting in the complete closure of the company. In June 2011 a California jury found Fayed guilty of murder and sentenced him to death.

====Pecunix====
Pecunix was a gold based digital currency (or e-currency) in which accounts had balances in GAU (gold grams).

Pecunix was founded by Simon &quot;Sidd&quot; Davis in 2002, and was registered and incorporated in Panama. All gold bullion was originally stored with Mat Securitas Express AG in Zürich, Switzerland, but in 2008 the Pecunix directors transferred the bullion to an undisclosed location.

In a 2012 interview with &quot;DGC Magazine&quot;, Mr. Davis described the development of the Voucher-Safe software and peer-to-peer network for the exchange of digital currencies. In early 2014, Pecunix announced they would be replacing their Pecunix Payments system with the open source Voucher-Safe system and PX-Gold. By the end of 2014, all legitimate digital currency exchangers had ceased dealing with Pecunix. In early 2015, Pecunix disabled the log-in feature of their website, thereby preventing all users from accessing their accounts. A statement on the Pecunix website claimed that this was a temporary change &quot;due to new management and restructuring&quot;, but access was never restored. The P2P Voucher Payment System became fully operational in August 2015, but PX-Gold never came into existence. Account holders never recovered their funds.

===Data security===
Digital gold systems are completely dependent on electronic storage and transmission of account ownership information. Therefore, the security of a given digital currency account is dependent upon the security of the issuer as well as the security of the accountholder&#x27;s computer.

While the digital gold issuers employ data security experts to protect their systems, the average accountholder&#x27;s computer is poorly protected against malware (trojans, worms and viruses) that can be used to intercept information used to access the user&#x27;s DGC account. Therefore, the most common attacks on digital currency systems are directed against accountholders&#x27; computers by the use of malicious spam, phishing and other methods.

Issuers have taken quite different approaches to this problem. E-gold basically places the entire responsibility on the user, and employs a user-name and password authentication system that is weak and highly vulnerable to interception by malware. (Though it is the most common authentication method used by online banks.) The &quot;not our problem&quot; approach to user security has negatively contributed to e-gold&#x27;s public image, as not a few e-gold accounts have been hacked and swept clean by attackers..

e-Bullion offers account holders a &quot;Cryptocard&quot; security token that changes the passphrase with each logon, but charges the account holder US$99.50 for the token. E-bullion does not require customers to use the Cryptocard, so account holders who choose not to get one may suffer from the same security issues as e-gold customers.

Pecunix devised a unique rotating key system that provides many of the benefits of a security token without requiring the user to buy one. Pecunix also supported the use of PGP signatures to access an account, which is probably the strongest of all authentication methods.

===Exchange risk===
Digital gold currency is a form of representative money as it directly represents gold metal on deposit or in custody. This depends on the issuer. Most issuers have the gold on deposit - i.e., the issuer will redeem the digital currency obligation with physical metal. Just as the exchange rates of national currencies fluctuate against each other, the exchange rates of DGCs fluctuate against national currencies, which is reflected by the price of gold in a particular currency. This creates exchange risk for any account holder, in the same way one would experience exchange risk by holding a bank account in a foreign currency.

Some DGC holders make use of the digital currency for daily monetary transactions, even though most of their normal income and expenses are denominated in the national currency of their home country. Fluctuations in the value of gold against their national currency can create some confusion and difficulty for new users as they see the &quot;value&quot; of their DGC account fluctuate in terms of their native currency.

In contrast to exchange risk, caused by gold&#x27;s fluctuation against national currency, the purchasing power of gold (and therefore DGCs) is measured by its fluctuation against other commodities, goods and services. Since gold has historically been the refuge of choice in times of inflation or economic hardship, the purchasing power of gold becomes stronger during times of negative sentiment in the markets. Due to this speculative interference, there are times when purchasing power has also declined. For example, in 2007–2008, gold volatility closely tracked the run-up in oil prices.

==Providers==
Comparison of operating DGCs:
==Criticisms==
DGC providers and exchangers have been accused of being a medium for fraudulent high-yield investment program (HYIP) schemes. In January 2006, &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; reported that ShadowCrew, an online gang, used the e-gold system in a massive identity theft and fraud scheme. Traditional banks are also used frequently for such fraud. Allegations that e-gold is a safe medium for crime and fraud are strongly denied by its chairman and founder, Dr. Douglas Jackson. Further, it can be argued that such problems lay with the source of the information or monies, rather than the location of storage of such ill-gotten gains. In other words, it would be difficult to claim the bank as villain when the criminal activity occurred by other parties away from the storage location.

Many DGC providers do not disclose the amount of bullion stored (see table), or do not allow independent external bullion audits, raising concerns that such companies do not maintain a 100% reserve ratio, or that their currency is entirely virtual and not backed by physical gold at all.

Due to increase of compliance requirements for payment service providers, Jersey-based GoldMoney decided to suspend its DGC service as from 21 January 2012

<text>[[Rowing (sport)|Rowing]] at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] took place at the Sydney International Regatta Centre in Penrith, New South Wales, Australia. It featured 547 competitors (363 men and 184 women) from 51 nations taking part in 14 events.

The medals were split among 20 nations. Romania was the most successful nation, topping the medal table with three golds, all won in the women&#x27;s events. Despite finishing second, Germany also dominated the medal table with six in overall. Great Britain and France, on the other hand, had a two-way tie for third place in the standings, with two golds and three in overall.

The men&#x27;s rowing events became most notable for Great Britain&#x27;s Steve Redgrave, who won his fifth consecutive Olympic gold medal for the coxless four. He first won at Los Angeles in 1984, followed by gold medals in 1988, 1992, 1996, and 2000, a record span of 16 years between his first and last gold medal. It was also his sixth overall Olympic medal, having won the bronze in 1988 for the coxed pair. At age 38, Redgrave also became the oldest male rower to win an Olympic gold medal, until he was surpassed by Australia&#x27;s James Tomkins at the subsequent games. Tomkins, competing in his fourth games, won the bronze medal, and third medal overall for the men&#x27;s coxless pair with his partner Matthew Long.

In the women&#x27;s rowing events, Romania&#x27;s Elisabeta Lipă won her third consecutive Olympic gold medal and fourth overall. Lipă, who was part of Romania&#x27;s women&#x27;s eight, won her first in Los Angeles in 1984, followed by gold medals in 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2004. It was also her seventh overall, having won a silver and a bronze in 1988 and an additional silver in 1992. Germany&#x27;s Kathrin Boron had won her first Olympic gold medal and third overall in the quadruple sculls, teaming up with her partner Jana Thieme.

The rowing events also depict some numerous dramatic races, as the single scull events became highly anticipated and closely contested. Ekaterina Karsten, the defending Olympic champion from Belarus, won a photo finish in the women&#x27;s single sculls, over Bulgaria&#x27;s Rumyana Neykova by one hundredths of a second. On the other hand, New Zealand&#x27;s Rob Waddell, world champion (and world record holder in indoor rowing) beat defending Olympic champion Xeno Müller of Switzerland, along with Germany&#x27;s Marcel Hacker and Canada&#x27;s Derek Porter in a tough, close race.

Great Britain won the gold medal in the men&#x27;s eight for the first time since 1912, beating Australia by four fifths of a second.

<text>An IRCd, short for Internet Relay Chat [[daemon (computing)|daemon]], is server software that implements the IRC protocol, enabling people to talk to each other via the Internet (exchanging textual messages in real time). It is distinct from an IRC bot that connects outbound to an IRC channel.

The server listens to connections from IRC clients on a set of TCP ports. When the server is part of an IRC network, it also keeps one or more established connections to other servers/daemons.

The term &quot;ircd&quot; originally referred to only one single piece of software, but it eventually became a generic reference to any implementation of an IRC daemon. However, the original version is still distributed under the same name, and this article discusses both uses.

== History ==
The original IRCd was known as &#x27;ircd&#x27;, and was authored by Jarkko Oikarinen (WiZ on IRC) in 1988. He received help from a number of others, such as Markku Savela (msa on IRC), who helped with the 2.2+msa release, etc.

In its first revisions, IRC did not have many features that are taken for granted today, such as named channels and channel operators. Channels were numbered – channel 4 and channel 57, for example – and the channel topic described the kind of conversation that took place in the channel. One holdover of this is that joining channel 0 causes a client to leave all the channels it is presently on: &quot;CHANNEL 0&quot; being the original command to leave the current channel.

The first major change to IRC, in version 2.5, was to add named channels – &quot;+channels&quot;. &quot;+channels&quot; were later replaced with &quot;#channels&quot; in version 2.7, numeric channels were removed entirely and channel bans (mode +b) were implemented.

Around version 2.7, there was a small but notable dispute, which led to ircu – the Undernet fork of ircd.

irc2.8 added &quot;&amp;channels&quot; (those that exist only on the current server, rather than the entire network) and &quot;!channels&quot; (those that are theoretically safe from suffering from the many ways that a user could exploit a channel by &quot;riding a netsplit&quot;), and is the baseline release from which nearly all current implementations are derived.

Around 2.8 came the concept of nick and channel delay, a system designed to help curb abusive practices such as takeovers and split riding. This was not agreed on by the majority of modern IRC (EFnet, DALnet, Undernet, etc.) – and thus, 2.8 was forked into a number of different daemons using an opposing theory known as TS – or time stamping, which stored a unique time stamp with each channel or nickname on the network to decide which was the &#x27;correct&#x27; one to keep.

Time stamping itself has been revised several times to fix various issues in its design. The latest versions of such protocols are:
* the TS6 protocol, which is used by EFnet, and Hybrid and Ratbox based servers amongst others
* the P10 protocol, which is used by Undernet and ircu based servers.

While the client-to-server protocols are at least functionally similar, server-to-server protocols differ widely (TS5, P10, and ND/CD server protocols are incompatible), making it very difficult to &quot;link&quot; two separate implementations of the IRC server. Some &quot;bridge&quot; servers do exist, to allow linking of, for example, 2.10 servers to TS5 servers, but these are often accompanied with restrictions of which parts of each protocol may be used, and are not widely deployed.

Significant releases based on 2.8 included:
* 2.8.21+CS, developed by Chris Behrens (Comstud)
* 2.8+th, Taner Halicioglu&#x27;s patchset, which later became
** Hybrid IRCd, originally developed by Jon Lusky (Rodder) and Diane Bruce (Dianora) as 2.8/hybrid, later joined by a large development team.
* 2.9, 2.10, 2.11, ... continue the development of the original codebase,

The original code base continued to be developed mainly for use on the IRCnet network. New server-to-server protocols were introduced in version 2.10, released in 1998, and in 2.11, first released in 2004, and current . This daemon is used by IRCnet and it can be found at http://www.irc.org/ftp/irc/server/ The original ircd is free software, licensed under the GNU General Public License. This development line produced the 4 IRC RFCs released after RFC 1459, which document this server protocol exclusively.

2.8.21+CS and Hybrid IRCd continue to be used on EFnet, with ircd-ratbox (an offshoot of ircd-hybrid) being the most popular.

=== Sidestream versions ===
More recently, several irc daemons were written from scratch, such as ithildin, InspIRCd, csircd (also written by Chris Behrens), ConferenceRoom, Microsoft Exchange Chat Service, WeIRCd, or IRCPlus/IRCXPro.

These attempts have met with mixed success, and large doses of skepticism from the existing IRC development community. With each new IRCd, a slightly different version of the IRC protocol is used, and many IRC clients and bots are forced to compromise on features or vary their implementation based on the server to which they are connected. These are often implemented for the purpose of improving usability, security, separation of powers, or ease of integration with services. Possibly one of the most common and visible differences is the inclusion or exclusion of the half-op channel operator status (which is not a requirement of the RFCs).

== Features ==

=== Ports ===
The officially assigned port numbers are 194 (&quot;irc&quot;), 529 (&quot;irc-serv&quot;), and 994 (&quot;ircs&quot;). However, these ports are in the &quot;privileged&quot; range (0–1024), which on a Unix-like system means that the daemon would historically have to have superuser privileges in order to open them. For various security reasons this used to be undesirable.

The common ports for an IRCd process are 6665 to 6669, with 6667 being the historical default. These ports can be opened by a non-superuser process, and they became widely used.

=== Connections ===
Running a large IRC server, one that has more than a few thousand simultaneous users, requires keeping a very large number of TCP connections open for long periods. Very few ircds are multithreaded as nearly every action needs to access (at least read and possibly modify) the global state.

The result is that the best platforms for ircds are those that offer efficient mechanisms for handling huge numbers of connections in a single thread. Linux offers this ability in the form of epoll, in kernel series newer than 2.4.x. FreeBSD (since 4.1) and OpenBSD (since 2.9) offers kqueue. Solaris has had /dev/poll since version 7, and from version 10 onwards has IOCP (I/O Completion Ports). Windows has supported IOCP since Windows NT 3.5. The difference made by these new interfaces can be dramatic. IRCU developers have mentioned increases in the practical capacity per server from 10,000 users to 20,000 users.

=== TLS (Transport Layer Security) ===
Some IRCd support Transport Layer Security, or TLS, for those who don&#x27;t, it is still possible to use SSL via Stunnel. The unofficial, but most often used port for TLS IRCd connections is 6697. More recently, as a security enhancement and usability enhancement, various client and server authors have begun drafting a standard known as the STARTTLS standard which allows for TLS and plain text connections to co-exist on the same TCP port.

=== IPv4 and IPv6 ===
IRC daemons support IPv4, and some also support IPv6. In general, the difference between IPv6 and IPv4 connections to IRC is purely academic and the service operates in much the same manner through either protocol.

=== Clustering ===
Large IRC networks consist of multiple servers for horizontal scaling purposes. There are several IRC protocol extensions for these purposes.

==== IRCX ====
IRCX (Internet Relay Chat eXtensions) is an extension to the IRC protocol developed by Microsoft

==== P10 ====
The P10 protocol is an extension to the Internet Relay Chat protocol for server to server communications developed by the Undernet Coder Committee to use in their ircu server software. It is similar in purpose to IRCX and EFnet TS5/TS6 protocols and implements nick and channel timestamping for handling nick collisions and netsplit channel riding, respectively. Other IRCd&#x27;s that utilize this protocol extension include beware ircd.

==== TS6 ====

The TS6 protocol is an extension to the Internet Relay Chat protocol for server to server communications developed initially by the developers of ircd-ratbox. It has been extended by various IRC software and has the feature that proper implementations of TS6 can link to each other by using feature negotiation—even if features are disparate.

== Configuration ==

=== Jupe ===
Juping a server, a channel, or a nickname refers to the practice of blocking said channel or nickname on the server or network or said server on the network. One possible explanation of how this term came about is that it is named after the oper named Jupiter, who gained control of the nickname NickServ on EFnet. EFnet does not offer services such as NickServ; Jupiter gained control of the nickname as he (among other operators) did not believe nicknames should be owned. Today, EFnet opers jupe nicknames that are used as services on other networks.

A nickname or server jupe takes advantage of the fact that certain identifiers are unique; by using an identifier, one acquires an exclusive lock that prevents other users from making use of it.

Officially sanctioned jupes may also utilize services or server configuration options to enforce the jupe, such as when a compromised server is juped to prevent it from harming the network.

In practice IRC operators now use jupe configurations to administratively make channel or nicknames unavailable. A channel jupe refers to a server specific ban of a channel, which means that a specific channel cannot be joined when connected to a certain server, but other servers may allow a user to join the channel. This is a way of banning access to problematic channels.

=== O-line ===
An O-line (frequently also spelled as O:line; on IRCds that support local operators, the O-lines of those are called o:lines with a lower-case O), shortened from &quot;Operator Line&quot; and derived from the line-based configuration file of the original IRCd, is a line of code in an IRC daemon configuration file that determines which users can become an IRC operator and which permissions they get upon doing so. The name comes from the prefix used for the line in the original IRCd, a capital O. The O-line specifies the username, password, operator flags, and hostmask restrictions for a particular operator. A server may have many O-lines depending on the administrative needs of the server and network.

Operator flags are used to describe the permissions an operator is granted. While some IRC operators may be in charge of network routing, others may be in charge of network abuse, making their need for certain permissions different. Operator flags available vary widely depending on which IRC daemon is in use. Generally, more feature rich IRC daemons tend to have more operator flags, and more traditional IRC daemons have fewer.

An O-line may also be set so that only users of a certain hostmask or IP address can gain IRC operator status using that O-line. Using hostmasks and IP addresses in the O-line requires the IP address to remain the same but provides additional security.

=== K-line ===
When a user is &quot;k-lined&quot; (short for kill line), the user is banned from a certain server, either for a certain amount of time or permanently. Once the user is banned, they are not allowed back onto that server. This is recorded as a line in the server&#x27;s IRC daemon configuration file prefixed with the letter &quot;K&quot;, hence &quot;K-line&quot;.

Some IRC daemons, including ircd-hybrid and its descendants, can be configured to propagate K-lines to some or all other servers on a network. In such a configuration, K-lines are effectively global bans similar to G-lines.

While the precise reason for the disconnection varies from case to case, usual reasons involve some aspect of the client or the user it is issued against.

; User behavior
: K-lines can be given due to inappropriate behavior on the part of the user, such as &quot;nickname colliding&quot;, mode &quot;hacking&quot;, multiple channel flooding, harassing other users via private messaging features, &quot;spamming&quot; etc., or in the case of older networks without timestamping, split riding, which cannot be corrected through use of channel operator privileges alone.
; Client software
: Some IRC daemons can be configured to scan for viruses or other vulnerabilities in clients connecting to them, and will react in various ways according to the result. Outdated and insecure client software might be blocked to protect other network users from vulnerabilities, for instance. Some networks will disconnect clients operating on/via open proxies, or running an insecure web server.
; Geographic location
: An IRC network operating multiple servers in different locales will attempt to reduce the distance between a client and a server. This is often achieved by disconnecting (and/or banning) clients from distant locales in favour of local ones.

There are a number of other network &quot;lines&quot; relating to the K-line. Modern IRC daemons will also allow IRC operators to set these lines during normal operation, where access to the server configuration file is not routinely needed.

=== G-line ===

A G-line or global kill line (also written G:line) is a global network ban applied to a user; the term comes from Undernet but on DALnet a similar concept known as an AKill was used.

G-lines are sometimes stored in the configuration file of the IRCd, although some networks, who handle K-lines through the IRC services, prefer to have them stored in their service&#x27;s configuration files. Whenever a G-lined person attempts to connect to the IRC network, either the services or the IRC daemon will automatically disconnect the client, often displaying a message explaining the reasoning behind the ban.

G-lines are a variant of K-lines, which work in much the same way, except K-lines only disconnect clients on one server of the network. G-lines are normally applied to a user who has received a K-line on one server but continues to abuse the network by connecting via a different server. G-lines are often regarded as an extreme measure, only to be used in cases of repeated abuse when extensive attempts have been made to reason with the offending user. Therefore, especially on larger networks, often only very high ranking global IRC operators are permitted to set them, while K-lines, which are mostly regarded as a local affair, are left to the operators of the individual server in the network.

G-lines also work slightly differently from K-lines. G-lines are typically set as *@IPaddress or *@host, with the first being the better option. If the *@host option is used, the server must conduct a reverse DNS lookup on the user and then compare the returned host to the hosts in the G-line list. This results in delay, and, if the DNS doesn&#x27;t return correct results, the banned user may still get on the network.

=== Z-line ===

A Z-line or zap line (also written Z:line) is similar to a K-line, but applied to a client&#x27;s IP address range, and is considered to be used in extreme cases. Because a Z-line does not have to check usernames (identd) or &quot;resolved&quot; hostnames, it can be applied to a user before they send any data at all upon connection. Therefore, a Z-line is more efficient and uses fewer resources than a K-line or G-line when banning large numbers of users.

In some IRC daemons such as ircd-hybrid, this is called a D-line (deny line) or an X-line.

Z-lines are sometimes stored in the configuration file of the IRCd, although some networks, who handle lines through the IRC services, prefer to have them stored in their service&#x27;s configuration files. Whenever a Z-lined person attempts to connect to the IRC network, either the services or the IRC daemon will automatically disconnect the client, often displaying a message explaining the reasoning behind the ban.

Z-lines are a variant of K-lines, which work in much the same way. Most Z-lines are &quot;awarded&quot; to people who abuse the network as a whole (on smaller networks, these are more frequently issued for isolated incidents).

Z-lines also work slightly differently from K-lines. Z-lines are typically set as *@IP or *@host, with the first being the better option. Z-lines do not wait for an ident response from the connecting user, but immediately close the socket once the user&#x27;s IP is compared to the Z-line list and a match is found. If the *@host option is used, the server must conduct a reverse DNS lookup on the user and then compare the returned host to the hosts in the Z-line list. This can result in delays, or if the DNS doesn&#x27;t return correctly, banned users could still get on the network. In actuality, the *@host option is completely against the intentions of using a Z-line, and therefore some IRCd programs will not allow anything other than *@IP, with wildcards (?,*) or CIDR prefix lengths (&quot;e.g. /8)&quot; allowed in the IP section to block entire subnets. Another difference from K-lines (which affect only IRC clients) is if an IP is banned, nothing, not even other servers, can connect from this IP (or IP range, depending on the banmask).

One advantage to using Z-lines over K-lines and G-lines, from a server or network administrator&#x27;s perspective, a Z-line uses less bandwidth than a K-line, mainly because it doesn&#x27;t wait for an ident response or DNS lookup.

A disadvantage to using Z-line over K-line or G-line is that it becomes more difficult to ban entire ISPs and very dynamic IP addresses, common with some dialup and DSL connections. For example, if a network administrator wants to ban all of ISP example.com (with hypothetical IP address ranges of 68.0.0.0 – 68.255.255.255 and 37.0.0.0 – 38.255.255.255), a G-line could use *@*example.com, whereas Z-line would require *@37.*.*.*, *@38.*.*.*, and *@68.*.*.* to accomplish the same thing.

Z-lines can also be global, in which case they are called GZ-lines. GZ-lines work in the same manner as Z-lines, except that they propagate to every server on the network. Some IRC daemons may also be configured to share Z-lines with other servers.

=== Q-line ===

On some IRCds, such as UnrealIRCd, a Q-line forbids a nickname, or any nickname matching a given pattern. This is most often used to forbid use of services nicknames (such as &quot;X&quot;, or NickServ) or forbid use of IRC operator nicknames by non-operators. Some IRC daemons may disconnect users when initially applying the Q-line, whilst others will force a nickname change, or do nothing until the user covered by the Q-line reconnects. Other IRCds, like ircd-hybrid, use the &quot;RESV&quot; (&quot;reserve&quot;) command instead, with the stats letter remaining as Q. The &quot;RESV&quot; command can also forbid a channel from being used.

<text>James Noble Tyner (January 17, 1826 – December 5, 1904) was a 19th Century American lawyer, U.S. Representative from Indiana and U.S. Postmaster General. Tyner served three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1869 to 1875.

President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Tyner Second Assistant Postmaster General in 1875, and U.S. Postmaster General in 1876. Tyner served as First Assistant Postmaster General under President Rutherford B. Hayes from 1877 to 1881. In October 1881, President Chester A. Arthur requested his resignation because of his involvement in the Star Route postal frauds and for giving his son, whom he had appointed superintendent of the Chicago Post Office, a $1,000 salary increase.

Tyner served as Assistant Attorney General in the U.S. Post Office Department from 1889 to 1893, and from 1897 to 1903. Postmaster General Henry C. Payne requested his resignation in April 1903, after which Tyner was indicted for fraud and bribery. Tyner was acquitted after his family controversially removed pertinent papers from his office safe.

==Early life and family==

James Noble Tyner was born in Brookville, Indiana, on January 17, 1826, one of twelve children born to Richard Tyner and Martha Sedgwick Willis Swift Noble. Tyner&#x27;s grandfather, William E. Tyner, was a pioneer Baptist minister who preached in Eastern Indiana for many years. His father was a prominent Indiana businessman, and his maternal uncle was Indiana Governor Noah Noble. Another brother was U.S. Senator James Noble. Tyner graduated from Brookville Academy in 1844 and joined his father&#x27;s banking and business ventures. Tyner then studied law, attained admission to the bar in 1857, and practiced in Peru, Indiana.

==Political career==
From 1857 to 1861, Tyner was secretary of the Indiana Senate. In 1860, he served as a Republican presidential elector and cast his ballot for Abraham Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin. From 1861 to 1866, Tyner was a special agent for the United States Post Office Department.

==U.S. Representative (1869–1875)==
In 1869, Tyner was elected to the United States House of Representatives to fill the vacancy caused when Representative-elect Daniel D. Pratt resigned after winning a seat in the United States Senate. Tyner represented Indiana&#x27;s 8th District during the 41st, 42nd, and 43rd U.S. Congresses from March 4, 1869, to March 3, 1875. Tyner, considered a reformer in his first two terms, gave few speeches in the House and was noted for his statistical accuracy and &quot;sound reasoning&quot;. After Congress passed the unpopular 1873 Salary Grab Act, many members lost their seats, and Tyner was among those who lost his party&#x27;s nomination for re-election in 1874.
===Advocated repeal of franking privilege===
On February 5, 1870, Tyner made his first House speech, in which he advocated for ending the Congressional Franking Privilege. President Grant&#x27;s Postmaster General John Creswell also advocated the end of franking, but efforts to eliminate it failed, and members of the U.S. House and U.S. Senate continued to send franked mail for free.

===Opposition to railroad subsidies===
Tyner spoke against granting large land subsidies to the Northern Pacific Railroad. In his view, the land between the Mississippi and the Pacific Ocean should be settled gradually over time, giving settlers free land to build houses. Tyner considered America to be an empire and believed U.S. citizens had a right to settle the West. On May 16, 1870, Tyner stated in a speech to the House, &quot;Much as we desire to see the country lying between the Mississippi and the Pacific teeming with an industrious population, it would be far better to reach that end by slow marches than to rush into a policy that will eventually retard its prosperity and check its growth.&quot;
===Salary Grab Act ===

On March 3, 1873, Grant signed a bill into law that increased the President&#x27;s pay from $25,000 to $50,000, raised Congressional salaries from $5,000 to $7,500, and included a $5,000 bonus for House and Senate members. Tyner voted for the bill, which came to be known as the &quot;Salary Grab Act&quot;. Newspapers widely publicized the $5,000 bonus, and the bill was repealed in January 1874, though the president&#x27;s salary raise remained in effect. The unpopularity of the salary grab led to many members of Congress losing their seats, and Tyner lost the Republican nomination when he ran for re-election in 1874.

===Committees served on===

* 41st Congress (1869–1871) 
::: &quot;House Education and Labor&quot; 7th-Majority
::: &quot;House Post Office and Post Roads,&quot; 6th-Majority.

* 42nd Congress (1871–1873) 
:::&quot;House Post Office and Post Roads&quot; 4th-Majority Chairman 
:::&quot;House Public Buildings and Grounds&quot; 3rd-Majority.
:::&quot;Washington Monument&quot; Select

*43rd Congress (1873–1875)
:::&quot;House Appropriations&quot; 3rd-Majority.

==Second assistant Postmaster General (1875–1876)==
In February 1875, Grant appointed Tyner as Second Assistant U.S. Postmaster General, serving under Postmaster General Marshall Jewell and First Assistant Postmaster General James William Marshall. He served from February 26, 1875, to July 12, 1876, when he was appointed as Jewell&#x27;s successor.

==Postmaster General (1876–1877) ==

On July 12, 1876, President Grant appointed Tyner Postmaster General, serving until March 12, 1877. Tyner secured his old position of Second Assistant Postmaster General to his fellow Indianan and Civil War general Thomas J. Brady appointed by President Grant. Brady was later involved in the Star Route postal scandal that was revealed after President James A. Garfield took office in 1881.

==First assistant Postmaster General (1877–1881)==

After the end of the Grant administration, he was appointed to First Assistant Postmaster General by President Rutherford B. Hayes, serving from 1877 until his resignation in October 1881. When President James A. Garfield took office on March 4, 1881, there were rumors of fraud in the postal department, where corrupt contractors had made excessive profits on Star Routes. President Garfield ordered an investigation by his appointed Postmaster General Thomas L. James. Tyner was familiar with the inner workings of the postal contract system and upon investigation by Postmaster General James was assumed to have known and allowed postal contract profiteering. James ordered Tyner to resign office by July, but after Garfield was assassinated and incapacitated, Tyner refused to leave. Also involved in the Star Route frauds was Second Assistant Postmaster Thomas J. Brady. The investigation revealed that Tyner had given his son a lucrative job of $2,000 a year as superintendent of the Chicago Post Office. When his son took the position Tyner had increased his salary from $1,000 to $2,000. After Garfield died on September 19, and former Vice President Chester A. Arthur took office, Arthur finally forced Tyner to vacate office on October 17, 1881.

==Later career==
On the evening of June 12, 1882, Tyner was seriously injured, suffering a concussion and bruising on his face after being thrown from a buggy while riding near Brightwood. Tyner recovered after being taken to the city for treatment.

Tyner was a delegate to the International Postal Congress in Paris in 1878 and in Washington, D.C., in 1897. Tyner served as Assistant Attorney General of the Post Office Department from 1889 to 1893 and again from 1897 to 1903.

==Post Office frauds and investigation (1903)==

On March 7, 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt launched an investigation into fraud in the Post Office. Early in April, Postmaster General Henry C. Payne asked Tyner to resign his office. Tyner pleaded with Payne to remain in office. Payne postponed Tyner&#x27;s resignation to May 1 and told Tyner he was suspended from duties as Assistant Attorney. This left Tyner in the precarious position of technically being an Assistant Attorney without administrative powers. Tyner instructed his wife to retrieve his official papers from the safe room in his Washington D.C. office on the fifth floor of the Postal Department. On Tuesday, April 20 Mrs. Tyner arrived at Tyner&#x27;s office at closing time, 4 P.M., and was allowed to enter Tyner&#x27;s office alone. Tyner&#x27;s wife then allowed entry to her sister-in-law and a company safe man by another door who unlocked the safe, after which, Mrs. Tyner retrieved all of Tyner&#x27;s official papers. Having bundled and packaged the papers Mrs. Tyner sent the papers with an African American messenger to Tyner&#x27;s residence. After her party had left by the other door, Mrs. Tyner walked out of Tyner&#x27;s office alone and returned to Tyner&#x27;s house. The head of the Post Office Bureau, George Christiancy, discovered the theft and informed Postmaster General Payne of the events. Payne sent two investigators to Tyner&#x27;s house, but Tyner and his wife refused to give the investigators Tyner&#x27;s any papers, and did not allow the investigators into Tyner&#x27;s residence.

On April 22, 1903, Assistant Attorney General Tyner was removed from office by Postmaster General Payne. Four days later on April 26 Tyner and his wife denied any wrongdoing. Tyner stated that he had served his country faithfully and the officials at the Post Office had &quot;lost their heads&quot;. Tyner asked to stay on as Assistant Attorney after March 9 to vindicate his honor, while Mrs. Tyner stated that she and her husband had been labeled robbers by the Postal Department. Mrs. Tyner said that she had been freely allowed to go into Tyner&#x27;s office, that nothing was done in secret, and that she had returned papers in a box to the Postal Department.

In mid-1903 Tyner was investigated for corruption in the Post Office by special prosecutor Charles J. Bonaparte and Fourth Assistant Postmaster General Joseph L. Bristow. Tyner was indicted three times for fraud and one count of bribery. First Assistant Postmaster Perry S. Heath was also indicted. President Roosevelt stated the postal investigation revealed a condition of &quot;gross corruption&quot; in their offices. Allegations against Tyner and Heath ranged from gross negligence of office and criminal collusion, to actual participation in frauds, bribery, and financial profiteering. Tyner was acquitted for lack of evidence since Tyner&#x27;s wife had removed his papers from his office in April. Bristow&#x27;s investigation resulted in 41 indictments against 31 persons connected to the postal fraud. Four postal officers and employees resigned, while thirteen workers were removed from office.

==Death==
From July, 1902, Tyner had been suffering from paralysis, and the postal investigation trial in 1904 had strained his health further. He died in Washington, D.C., on December 5, 1904, and was interred there in Oak Hill Cemetery.

==Historical reputation==
Tyner was the only member of the Grant Administration cabinet to hold a federal office appointment in the 20th Century, serving under President William McKinley and President Theodore Roosevelt. He was elected three times to the House starting in 1869, however he was not reelected in 1874 due to his vote for the controversial Salary Grab Act. His long career in the Post Office Department was suspended in 1881 and finally ended in 1903 under suspicion of corruption. In 1903, Tyner&#x27;s reputation was damaged after taking official government documents from his office in Washington D.C.

<doc id="730242" wikidata="Q471811" url="?curid=730242" title="Steve Cropper">
<text>Steven Lee Cropper (born October 21, 1941), sometimes known as &quot;The Colonel&quot;, is an American guitarist, songwriter and record producer. He is the guitarist of the Stax Records house band, Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, which backed artists such as Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Sam &amp; Dave, Carla Thomas, Rufus Thomas and Johnnie Taylor. He also acted as the producer of many of these records. He was later a member of the Blues Brothers band. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked him 36th on its list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time, while he has won two Grammy Awards from his seven nominations.

==Early life==
Born on a farm near Willow Springs, Missouri, Cropper lived in Dora and West Plains before moving with his family to Memphis at age 9. In Memphis, he was exposed to black church music, which had an impact on him musically. Cropper acquired his first guitar at age 14.

He loved the Five Royals and he admired guitarists including Tal Farlow, Chuck Berry, Jimmy Reed, Chet Atkins, Lowman Pauling of the Five Royales and Billy Butler of the Bill Doggett band.

==Career==
Cropper and guitarist Charlie Freeman formed the Royal Spades, who eventually became the Mar-Keys. The name referred to the marquee outside Stax studios, known as Satellite Records at the time. Eventually, the Mar-Keys began playing on sessions and had a hit single of their own with &quot;Last Night&quot; in 1961.

Besides being impressed with the young guitarist&#x27;s playing, Stax Records president Jim Stewart saw professionalism and maturity beyond Cropper&#x27;s years. When American Records founder Chips Moman left Stax, Cropper became the company&#x27;s A&amp;R man. He became a founding member of the Stax house band Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, along with Hammond organ player Booker T. Jones, bassist Lewie Steinberg (who was replaced by Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn soon thereafter) and drummer Al Jackson Jr. As a house guitarist, he played on many recordings such as &quot;(Sittin&#x27; On) the Dock of the Bay&quot;, co-written with and performed by Otis Redding and Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s &quot;Soul Man&quot; on which he was mentioned by name. When Cropper played on the song&#x27;s remake by the Blues Brothers, lead singer John Belushi again mentioned Cropper. On the early Stax recordings, Cropper is known to have played a 1956 Fender Esquire and later used a blonde Fender Telecaster.

At this time, Cropper&#x27;s fame was not limited to the United States. The Beatles favored Cropper&#x27;s playing, and his production on Otis Redding records. John Lennon and Paul McCartney made tentative plans to record in Memphis and to work with the guitarist. However Brian Epstein canceled the sessions, citing security problems. Regarding this period, Rob Bowman, in his book &quot;Soulsville U.S.A.: The Story of Stax Records&quot;, quoted Booker T. Jones as saying:

Along with influential work with Booker T &amp; The MG&#x27;s, Cropper co-wrote &quot;Knock on Wood&quot; with Eddie Floyd, &quot;In the Midnight Hour&quot; with Wilson Pickett and &quot;(Sittin&#x27; On) The Dock of the Bay&quot; with Otis Redding. In 1969, Cropper released his first solo album, &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends&quot;.

When Cropper left Stax in the fall of 1970, the label lost one of its most successful producers and songwriters. Cropper then set up TMI Studios with Jerry Williams and former Mar-Key Ronnie Stoots. He worked with many musicians including Tower of Power, Rod Stewart, John Prine, José Feliciano, The Jeff Beck Group, Ringo Starr and John Lennon.

By 1975, Cropper had moved to Los Angeles and along with Jones, Jackson and Dunn, reformed Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s. Jackson, whom Cropper called &quot;the greatest drummer to ever walk the Earth,&quot; was murdered in his Memphis home before the group could make their comeback. In 1978, Cropper and Dunn became members of Levon Helm&#x27;s RCO All-Stars and then went on to figure prominently in the Blues Brothers Band with drummer Willie Hall. This led to two albums, appearances in the movies &quot;Blues Brothers&quot; and &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot;, and the movies&#x27; soundtracks. Cropper also re-recorded &quot;(Sittin&#x27; On) The Dock of the Bay&quot; (1979) for Sammy Hagar. Cropper lived in Los Angeles for the next thirteen years before moving to Nashville and reuniting with the Blues Brothers Band in 1988.

Cropper has a cameo in the &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic mockumentary &quot;The Compleat Al&quot; (1985), where he plays a bit of &quot;Soul Man&quot; in an unsuccessful attempt to join Al&#x27;s band.

In 1991 Cropper played on two separate nights of the Expo &#x27;92 Guitar Legends concerts as part of the celebration of Seville hosting the 1992 Expo exhibition. The concerts over five nights included some of the world&#x27;s best guitarists such as Cropper, BB King, Robert Cray, Eric Clapton, Bo Diddley, Brian May, Albert Collins, Bob Dylan, Joe Satriani, and Steve Vai.

In 1992, Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Cropper appeared with a new line-up of the group for the Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary concert, in October 1992 at Madison Square Garden, performing songs by and backing Dylan, Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Tom Petty, Johnny Cash, Chrissie Hynde, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Stevie Wonder and Neil Young. The concert was recorded and later released as &quot;The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration&quot; (1993). Young later recruited this line up of Booker T. and the M.G&#x27;s to tour with him and record as his studio band.

In 1996, Cropper was named &quot;the greatest living guitar player&quot; by Britain&#x27;s &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine. When asked what he thought of Cropper, the guitarist Keith Richards said, &quot;Perfect, man.&quot; In February 1998, Cropper released &quot;The Interview — Play It, Steve!&quot; which included some of soul music&#x27;s most enduring songs.

<text>In the context of information security, social engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. A type of confidence trick for the purpose of information gathering, fraud, or system access, it differs from a traditional &quot;con&quot; in the sense that it is often one of the many steps in a more complex fraud scheme. It has also been defined as &quot;any act that influences a person to take an action that may or may not be in their best interests.&quot;

Research done in 2020 has indicated that social engineering will be one of the most prominent challenges of the upcoming decade. Having proficiency in social engineering will be increasingly important for organizations and countries, due to the impact on geopolitics as well. Social engineering raises the question of whether our decisions will be accurately informed if our primary information is engineered and biased.

Social engineering attacks have been increasing in intensity and number, cementing the need for novel detection techniques and cyber security educational programs.

==Techniques and terms==
All social engineering techniques are based on exploitable weaknesses in human decision-making known as cognitive biases. 

One example of social engineering is an individual who walks into a building and posts an official-looking announcement to the company bulletin that says the number for the help desk has changed. So, when employees call for help the individual asks them for their passwords and IDs thereby gaining the ability to access the company&#x27;s private information.
Another example of social engineering would be that the hacker contacts the target on a social networking site and starts a conversation with the target. Gradually the hacker gains the trust of the target and then uses that trust to get access to sensitive information like password or bank account details.

===Pretexting===

Pretexting (adj. pretextual), also known in the UK as blagging, is the act of creating and using an invented scenario (the pretext) to engage a targeted victim in a manner that increases the chance the victim will divulge information or perform actions that would be unlikely in ordinary circumstances. An elaborate lie, it most often involves some prior research or setup and the use of this information for impersonation (&quot;e.g.&quot;, date of birth, Social Security number, last bill amount) to establish legitimacy in the mind of the target.

===Water holing===

Water holing is a targeted social engineering strategy that capitalizes on the trust users have in websites they regularly visit. The victim feels safe to do things they would not do in a different situation. A wary person might, for example, purposefully avoid clicking a link in an unsolicited email, but the same person would not hesitate to follow a link on a website they often visit. So, the attacker prepares a trap for the unwary prey at a favored watering hole. This strategy has been successfully used to gain access to some (supposedly) very secure systems.

===Baiting===
Baiting is like the real-world Trojan horse that uses physical media and relies on the curiosity or greed of the victim. In this attack, attackers leave malware-infected floppy disks, CD-ROMs, or USB flash drives in locations people will find them (bathrooms, elevators, sidewalks, parking lots, etc.), give them legitimate and curiosity-piquing labels, and wait for victims.

Unless computer controls block infections, insertion compromises PCs &quot;auto-running&quot; media. Hostile devices can also be used. For instance, a &quot;lucky winner&quot; is sent a free digital audio player compromising any computer it is plugged to. A &quot;road apple&quot; (the colloquial term for horse manure, suggesting the device&#x27;s undesirable nature) is any removable media with malicious software left in opportunistic or conspicuous places. It may be a CD, DVD, or USB flash drive, among other media. Curious people take it and plug it into a computer, infecting the host and any attached networks. Again, hackers may give them enticing labels, such as &quot;Employee Salaries&quot; or &quot;Confidential&quot;.

One study published in 2016 had researchers drop 297 USB drives around the campus of the University of Illinois. The drives contained files on them that linked to webpages owned by the researchers. The researchers were able to see how many of the drives had files on them opened, but not how many were inserted into a computer without having a file opened. Of the 297 drives that were dropped, 290 (98%) of them were picked up and 135 (45%) of them &quot;called home&quot;.

==Law==
In common law, pretexting is an invasion of privacy tort of appropriation.

===Pretexting of telephone records===
In December 2006, United States Congress approved a Senate sponsored bill making the pretexting of telephone records a federal felony with fines of up to $250,000 and ten years in prison for individuals (or fines of up to $500,000 for companies). It was signed by President George W. Bush on 12 January 2007.

===Federal legislation===
The 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) is a U.S. Federal law that specifically addresses pretexting of banking records as an illegal act punishable under federal statutes. When a business entity such as a private investigator, SIU insurance investigator, or an adjuster conducts any type of deception, it falls under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). This federal agency has the obligation and authority to ensure that consumers are not subjected to any unfair or deceptive business practices. US Federal Trade Commission Act, Section 5 of the FTCA states, in part:
&quot;Whenever the Commission shall have reason to believe that any such person, partnership, or corporation has been or is using any unfair method of competition or unfair or deceptive act or practice in or affecting commerce, and if it shall appear to the Commission that a proceeding by it in respect thereof would be to the interest of the public, it shall issue and serve upon such person, partnership, or corporation a complaint stating its charges in that respect.&quot;

The statute states that when someone obtains any personal, non-public information from a financial institution or the consumer, their action is subject to the statute. It relates to the consumer&#x27;s relationship with the financial institution. For example, a pretexter using false pretenses either to get a consumer&#x27;s address from the consumer&#x27;s bank, or to get a consumer to disclose the name of their bank, would be covered. The determining principle is that pretexting only occurs when information is obtained through false pretenses.

While the sale of cell telephone records has gained significant media attention, and telecommunications records are the focus of the two bills currently before the United States Senate, many other types of private records are being bought and sold in the public market. Alongside many advertisements for cell phone records, wireline records and the records associated with calling cards are advertised. As individuals shift to VoIP telephones, it is safe to assume that those records will be offered for sale as well. Currently, it is legal to sell telephone records, but illegal to obtain them.

===1st Source Information Specialists===
U.S. Rep. Fred Upton (R-Kalamazoo, Michigan), chairman of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, expressed concern over the easy access to personal mobile phone records on the Internet during a House Energy &amp; Commerce Committee hearing on &quot;Phone Records For Sale: &quot;Why Aren&#x27;t Phone Records Safe From Pretexting?&quot;&quot; Illinois became the first state to sue an online records broker when Attorney General Lisa Madigan sued 1st Source Information Specialists, Inc. A spokeswoman for Madigan&#x27;s office said. The Florida-based company operates several Web sites that sell mobile telephone records, according to a copy of the suit. The attorneys general of Florida and Missouri quickly followed Madigan&#x27;s lead, filing suits respectively, against 1st Source Information Specialists and, in Missouri&#x27;s case, one other records broker – First Data Solutions, Inc.

Several wireless providers, including T-Mobile, Verizon, and Cingular filed earlier lawsuits against records brokers, with Cingular winning an injunction against First Data Solutions and 1st Source Information Specialists. U.S. Senator Charles Schumer (D-New York) introduced legislation in February 2006 aimed at curbing the practice. The Consumer Telephone Records Protection Act of 2006 would create felony criminal penalties for stealing and selling the records of mobile phone, landline, and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) subscribers.

===Hewlett Packard===
Patricia Dunn, former chairwoman of Hewlett Packard, reported that the HP board hired a private investigation company to delve into who was responsible for leaks within the board. Dunn acknowledged that the company used the practice of pretexting to solicit the telephone records of board members and journalists. Chairman Dunn later apologized for this act and offered to step down from the board if it was desired by board members. Unlike Federal law, California law specifically forbids such pretexting. The four felony charges brought on Dunn were dismissed.

==Notable social engineering incidents==

===Equifax breach help websites===

Following the 2017 Equifax data breach linked to China&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army in which over 150 million private records were leaked (including Social Security numbers, and drivers license numbers, birthdates, etc.), warnings were sent out regarding the dangers of impending security risks. In the day after the establishment of a legitimate help website (equifaxsecurity2017.com) dedicated to people potentially victimized by the breach, 194 malicious domains were reserved from small variations on the URL, capitalizing on the likelihood of people mistyping.

=== 2016 United States Elections Leaks ===
During the 2016 United States Elections, hackers associated with Russian Military Intelligence (GRU) sent phishing emails directed to members of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaign, disguised as a Google alert. Many members, including the chairman of the campaign, John Podesta, had entered their passwords thinking it would be reset, causing their personal information, and thousands of private emails and documents to be leaked. With this information, they hacked into other computers in the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, implanting malware in them, which caused their computer activities to be monitored and leaked.

=== Google and Facebook phishing emails ===
Two tech giants—Google and Facebook—were phished out of $100 million by a Lithuanian fraudster. He impersonated a hardware supplier to falsely invoice both companies over two years. Despite their technological sophistication, the companies lost the money.

=== Sony pictures leak ===
On 24 November 2014, the hacker group &quot;Guardians of Peace&quot; (probably linked to North Korea) leaked confidential data from the film studio Sony Pictures Entertainment. The data included emails, executive salaries, and employees&#x27; personal and family information. The phishers pretended to be high up employees to install malware on workers&#x27; computers.

==Notable social engineers==

===Susan Headley===
Susan Headley became involved in phreaking with Kevin Mitnick and Lewis de Payne in Los Angeles, but later framed them for erasing the system files at US Leasing after a falling out, leading to Mitnick&#x27;s first conviction. She retired to professional poker.

===Mike Ridpath ===
Mike Ridpath is a security consultant, published author, speaker and previous member of w00w00. He is well known for developing techniques and tactics for social engineering through cold calling. He became well known for live demonstrations as well as playing recorded calls after talks where he explained his thought process on what he was doing to get passwords through the phone. As a child, Ridpath was connected with Badir Brothers and was widely known within the phreaking and hacking community for his articles with popular underground ezines, such as, Phrack, B4B0 and 9x on modifying Oki 900s, blueboxing, satellite hacking and RCMAC.

===Badir Brothers===
Brothers Ramy, Muzher, and Shadde Badir—all of whom were blind from birth—managed to set up an extensive phone and computer fraud scheme in Israel in the 1990s using social engineering, voice impersonation, and Braille-display computers.

===Christopher J. Hadnagy===
Christopher J. Hadnagy is an American social engineer and information technology security consultant. He is best known as an author of 4 books on social engineering and cyber security and founder of Innocent Lives Foundation, an organization that helps tracking and identifying child trafficking by seeking the assistance of information security specialists, using data from open-source intelligence (OSINT) and collaborating with law enforcement.

<text>Social engineering is a term which has been used to refer to efforts in influencing particular attitudes and social behaviors on a large scale. This is often undertaken by governments, but may be also carried out by mass media, academia or private groups in order to produce desired characteristics in a target population.

==Origin of concept==
The Dutch industrialist J.C. Van Marken (nl) used the term &quot;sociale ingenieurs&quot; (&quot;social engineers&quot;) in an essay in 1894. The idea was that modern employers needed the assistance of specialists in handling the &quot;human&quot; challenges, just as they needed technical expertise (traditional engineers) to deal with non-human challenges (materials, machines, processes). &quot;Social engineering&quot; was the title of a small journal in 1899 (renamed &quot;Social Service&quot; from 1900), and in 1909 it was the title of a book by the journal&#x27;s former editor, William H. Tolman (translated into French in 1910). With the Social Gospel sociologist Edwin L. Earp&#x27;s &quot;The Social Engineer&quot;, published during the &quot;efficiency craze&quot; of 1911 in the U.S., a new usage of the term was launched that has since then become standard: &quot;Social engineering&quot; came to refer to an approach of treating social relations as &quot;machineries&quot;, to be dealt with in the manner of the technical engineer.

==Historical examples==
In the 1920s, the government of the Soviet Union embarked on a campaign to fundamentally alter the behavior and ideals of Soviet citizens, to replace the old social frameworks of the Russian Empire with a new Soviet culture, and to develop the New Soviet man. Commissars became agents of social engineering.

In India, social engineering was said to have been done by the state of Bihar, on a grand scale, to unify different castes after 2005.

In his political science book, &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot;, volume I, &quot;The Spell of Plato&quot; (1945), Karl Popper made a distinction between the principles of &#x27;what he called &quot;piecemeal social engineering&quot; and &quot;Utopian&quot; social engineering.

<text>James Hoge Tyler (August 11, 1846 – January 3, 1925) was a Confederate soldier, writer and political figure. He served in the Virginia Senate and became the 16th Lieutenant Governor of Virginia (1890 to 1894) and the 43rd Governor of Virginia (1898 to 1902). He compiled &quot;The Family of Hoge&quot;, published posthumously in 1927.

==Early and family life==
James Tyler was born at Blenheim plantation in Caroline County, Virginia, on August 11, 1846, to George Tyler (1817–1889) and his second wife Eliza Hoge (1815-1846). His parents were both descended from the First Families of Virginia. His great-grandfather, also George Tyler (1755-1833), served as a lieutenant in the Caroline County militia during the American Revolutionary War and descended from Richard Tyler who settled in Essex County in the 17th century. His father George Tyler was the eldest son of Henry Tyler (1791-1861) and his wife Lucy Coleman,
 All of his ancestors came to America from England and all arrived in the Colony of Virginia in the 1600s.
Two hours after James was born, his mother died of complications from the birth. His maternal grandparents took the boy 300 miles by carriage to their home, Hayfield, subsequently known as Belle Hampton, in Pulaski County, Virginia. There he was raised by his maternal grandparents, General James F. Hoge (1783-1861) and Eleanor Haven Howe, as well as his uncle William E. Hoge and his wife Jane with their daughter and two sons of similar ages. James F. Hoge owned 17 enslaved persons in 1850, and more in 1860.

Private tutors and his grandfather educated James until General Hoge died in 1861. When James Tyler was ten, his grandmother died and his grandfather soon suffered a stroke. J. H. Tyler inherited a number of properties from his maternal grandfather, including Belle-Hampton. The teenager soon joined his father in Caroline County (his paternal grandfather dying in the same year). Because Virginia&#x27;s secession embroiled Caroline County, Tyler attended a school run by Franklin Minor in Albemarle County.

On November 16, 1868, he married Sou (or Sue) Montgomery Hammet (1845-1927) of Montgomery County, Virginia. The children by that marriage were Edward Hammet Tyler, James Hoge Tyler Jr., Stockton Heth Tyler, Belle Norwood McConnell, Sue Hampton, Henry Clement Tyler, Eliza (Lily), and Eleanor.

==American Civil War==

About 1862, when he reached the legal age of 16, J. H. Tyler enlisted in the Army of the Confederate States of America. He remained as a private until the war&#x27;s end rather than accept a commission as an officer and be separated from his friends.

==Postwar career==
After Virginia&#x27;s surrender to Union forces, Tyler returned to Pulaski County and tried to resume farming. He also published articles urging manufacturing and mining development. Elected to the Virginia Senate in 1877, he urged state taxes be reduced from 50 to 40 cents and also served on the commission to settle the state debt. Tyler was a member of the boards of public buildings at Blacksburg and Marion, and became rector of the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College (now known as Virginia Tech).

Active in the state Democratic party, especially the statewide organization created by Senator Thomas Staples Martin, Tyler became the organization&#x27;s candidate for Lieutenant Governor, and helped settle the disputed border between Maryland and Virginia. He defeated fellow Confederate veteran James Taylor Ellyson before the party&#x27;s primary to become its candidate for governor in the Virginia 1897 election (and Ellyson began the first of three terms as lieutenant governor).

In the general election, voters elected Tyler Governor of Virginia. He won 64.59% of the vote, defeating Republican Patrick H. McCaull (who won 33.24% of the votes), as well as Prohibitionist L.A. Cutler, Socialist John J. Quantz, and Independent James S. Cowden. During his term as governor, Tyler reduced the public debt by more than a million dollars, but increased the public school fund by $21,000 and the literary fund by $68,000, and also reduced the tax rate from 40 to 30 cents. He also settled the boundary dispute between Tennessee and Virginia. In 1900 the Virginia legislature passed the state&#x27;s first Jim Crow segregation statute, which Governor Tyler signed into law.

After his governorship, Tyler returned to Radford, where he resumed farming and lived with his son Hal (Henry C.) Tyler (who was serving as the local Commonwealth&#x27;s attorney in 1910), and daughters Lily and Lucy. Tyler spent the last years of his life compiling &quot;The Family of Hoge&quot;, a genealogy of the descendants of William Hoge and Barbara Hume, his great-great-great-grandparents and the American progenitors of the Hoge Family.

A devout Presbyterian, Tyler was thrice elected to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church. In 1892 he was a delegate to the Pan Presbyterian Alliance in Toronto, and in 1896 became a delegate to the convention in Glasgow, Scotland, where he presided over one of the sessions. He also served on the boards of trustees of Hampden–Sydney College, the Union Theological Seminary and the Synodical Orphans Home at Lynchburg.

==Death and legacy==

Governor J.H. Tyler died January 3, 1925, at Halwick (renamed Halwyck by subsequent owners of the property in the 1990s), which he built in 1892, and which his lawyer son Henry C. Tyler and widowed daughter Lily Wilson helped run. He was buried in Radford at West View cemetery, where his widow would join him two years later.

The Library of Virginia holds his papers. Halwyck (originally &quot;Halwick&quot;) was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. His childhood home, Blenheim, also exists, and Caroline County officials believe it eligible for similar treatment, but its private owners have not yet chosen to apply for that status, which would entail development restrictions.

<text>Market value or OMV (open market valuation) is the price at which an asset would trade in a competitive auction setting. Market value is often used interchangeably with &quot;open market value&quot;, &quot;fair value&quot; or &quot;fair market value&quot;, although these terms have distinct definitions in different standards, and differ in some circumstances.

==Definition==
International Valuation Standards defines market value as &quot;the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s-length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently, and without compulsion&quot;.

Market value is a concept distinct from market price, which is &quot;the price at which one can transact&quot;, while market value is &quot;the true underlying value&quot; according to theoretical standards. The concept is most commonly invoked in inefficient markets or disequilibrium situations where prevailing market prices are not reflective of true underlying market value. For market price to equal market value, the market must be informationally efficient and rational expectations must prevail.

Mocciaro Li Destri, Picone &amp; Minà (2012) have underscored the subtle but important difference between the firms’ capacity to create value through correct operational choices and valid strategies, on the one hand, and the epiphenomenal manifestation of variations in stockholder value on the financial markets (notably on stock markets). In this perspective, they suggest to implement new methodologies able to bring strategy back into financial performance measures.

Market value is also distinct from fair value in that fair value depends on the parties involved, while market value does not. For example, IVS currently notes fair value &quot;requires the assessment of the price that is fair between two specific parties taking into account the respective advantages or disadvantages that each will gain from the transaction. Although market value may meet these criteria, this is not necessarily always the case. Fair value is frequently used when undertaking due diligence in corporate transactions, where particular synergies between the two parties may mean that the price that is fair between them is higher than the price that might be obtainable in the wider market. In other words &quot;special value&quot; may be generated. Market value requires this element of &quot;special value&quot; to be disregarded, but it forms part of the assessment of fair value.

==Real estate==
The term is commonly used in real estate appraisal, since real estate markets are generally considered both informationally and transactionally inefficient. Also, real estate markets are subject to prolonged periods of disequilibrium, such as in contamination situations or other market disruptions.

Appraisals are usually performed under some set of assumptions about transactional markets, and those assumptions are captured in the definition of value used for the appraisal. Commonly, the definition set forth for U.S. federally regulated lending institutions is used, although other definitions may also be used under some circumstances:

:&quot;The most probable price (in terms of money) which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently and knowledgeably, and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby: the buyer and seller are typically motivated; both parties are well informed or well advised, and acting in what they consider their best interests; a reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market; payment is made in terms of cash in United States dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and the price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale.&quot;

In the US, licensed or certified appraisers may be required under state, federal, or local laws to develop appraisals subject to USPAP Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. The Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice requires that when market value is the applicable definition, the appraisal must also contain an analysis of the highest and best use as well as an estimation of exposure time. All states require mandatory licensure of appraisers.

USPAP does not require that all real estate appraisals be performed based on a single definition of market value. There are frequent situations when appraisers are called upon to appraise properties using other value definitions. If a value other than market value is appropriate, USPAP only requires that the appraiser provide both the definition of value being used and the citation for that definition.

=== Other definitions===
Market value is the most commonly used type of value in real estate appraisal in the United States because it is required for all federally regulated mortgage transactions, and because it has been accepted by US courts as valid. However, real estate appraisers use many other definitions of value in other situations.

====Liquidation value====
Liquidation value is the most probable price that a specified interest in real property is likely to bring under all of the following conditions:

# Consummation of a sale will occur within a severely limited future marketing period specified by the client.
# The actual market conditions currently prevailing are those to which the appraise property interest is subject.
# The buyer is acting prudently and knowledgeably.
# The seller is under extreme compulsion to sell.
# The buyer is typically motivated.
# The buyer is acting in what he or she considered his or her best interest.
# A limited marketing effort and time will be allowed for the completion of the sale.
# Payment will be made in cash in U.S. dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto.
# The price represents the normal consideration for the property sold, unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale.

====Orderly liquidation value====

This value definition differs from the previous one in that it assumes an orderly transition, and not &quot;extreme compulsion&quot;.

====Federal land acquisition====

For land acquisitions by or funded by U.S. federal agencies, a slightly different definition applies:

:&quot;Fair market value is defined as the amount in cash or terms reasonably equivalent to cash, for which in all probability the property would be sold by a knowledgeable owner willing but not obligated to sell to a knowledgeable purchaser who desired but is not obligated to buy. In ascertaining that figure, consideration should be given to all matters that might be brought forward and reasonably be given substantial weight in bargaining by persons of ordinary prudence, but no consideration whatever should be given to matters not affecting market value.&quot;

====Going concern value====
When a real estate appraiser works with a business valuation appraiser (and perhaps an equipment and machinery appraiser) to provide a value of the combination of a business and the real estate used for that business, the specific market value is called &quot;going concern value&quot;. It recognizes that the combined market value may be different from the sum of the separate values: &quot;The market value of all the tangible and intangible assets of an established operating business with an indefinite life, as if sold in aggregate.&quot;

====Use value====
Use value takes into account a specific use for the subject property and does not attempt to ascertain the highest and best use of the real estate. For example, the appraisal may focus on the contributory value of the real estate to a business enterprise.

Some property tax jurisdictions allow agricultural use appraisals for farmland. Also, current IRS estate tax regulations allow land under an interim agricultural use to be valued according to its current use regardless of development potential.

==Economic value and investor confidence==
Stability and economic growth are two factors that international investors are seeking when considering investment options. A country offering economic value amongst its other incentives attracts investment funds. A political unrest situation can be the cause of not only loss of confidence, but a reduced value in currency, creating transfer of capital to other and more stable sources.

In the event of a government printing currency to discharge a portion of a significant amount of debt, the supply of money is increased, with an ultimate reduction in its value, aggravated by inflation. Furthermore, should a government be unable to service its deficit by way of selling domestic bonds, thereby increasing the supply of money, it must increase the volume of saleable securities to foreigners, which in turn creates a decrease in their value.

A significant debt can prove a concern for foreign investors, should they believe there is a risk of the country defaulting on its obligations. They will be reluctant to purchase securities subject to that particular currency, if there is a perceived, significant risk of default. It is for this reason that the debt rating of a country; for example, as determined by Moody&#x27;s or Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s is a crucial indicator of its exchange rate.

Currency values and exchange rates play a crucial part in the rate of return on investments. Value for an investor, is the exchange rate of the currency which, contains the bulk of a portfolio, determining its real return. A declining value in the exchange rate has the effect of decreasing the purchasing power of income and capital gains, derived from any returns. In addition, other income factors such as interest rates, inflation and even capital gains from domestic securities, are influenced by the influential and complex factors, of the exchange rate.

==Legal interpretation==
The case of Luxmoore-May and Another v. Messenger May Baverstock [1990] 1 W.L.R. 1009 shows us the legal interpretation of market value: &quot;The measure of damage in this case is, I conclude, the difference between what the foxhounds in fact realised consequent on the defendants&#x27; breach of contract and what was their true open market value at that time. What better guide could there be to that value than the price at which these paintings happened to be knocked down at Sotheby&#x27;s so shortly afterwards? The price which the international art market was willing to pay was surely prima facie the best evidence of the foxhounds&#x27; value.&quot;

<text>Judeo-Berber also known as Judeo-Amazigh, Judeo-Tamazight, and Jewish Amazigh ( &quot;tamazight n wudayen&quot;, berberit yehudit) is any of several hybrid Berber dialects traditionally spoken as a second language in Berber Jewish communities of central and southern Morocco, and perhaps earlier in Algeria. Judeo-Berber is a contact language; the first language of speakers was Judeo-Arabic. Speakers immigrated to Israel in the 1950s and 1960s. While mutually comprehensible with the Tamazight spoken by most inhabitants of the area (Galand-Pernet et al. 1970:14), these varieties are distinguished by the use of Hebrew loanwords and the pronunciation of &quot;š&quot; as &quot;s&quot; as seen in Judeo-Moroccan Arabic.

== History ==
Our first indication of Jews speaking any Berber language is only from the early 19th century and it&#x27;s of rural Jews in Jebel Nefusa and Saharan Ghardaia. As of 1912 about 8,000 of Moroccan Jews spoke Judeo-Berber. the language was spoken in the country&#x27;s Berber or partly Berber rural and mountainous areas. According to a 1936 survey, approximately 145,700 of Morocco&#x27;s 161,000 Jews spoke a variety of Berber (though not specifically Judeo-Berber), 25,000 of whom were reportedly monolingual in a Berber language. Due to the mass migration of Moroccan Jews after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war the speaker count declined as the language wasn&#x27;t passed down to new speakers, leaving it with only about 200 speakers left in France and Israel as of 2023.

=== Geographic distribution ===
Communities in Morocco where Jews spoke Judeo-Berber included: Tinghir, Ouijjane, Asaka, Imini, Draa valley, Demnate and Ait Bou Oulli in the Tamazight-speaking Middle Atlas and High Atlas and Oufrane, Tiznit and Illigh in the Tashelhiyt-speaking Souss valley (Galand-Pernet et al. 1970:2). Jews were living among tribal Berbers, often in the same villages and practiced old tribal Berber protection relationships.

== Phonology ==
Judeo-Berber is characterized by the following phonetic phenomena:

* Centralized pronunciation of /i u/ as [ɨ ʉ]
* Neutralization of the distinction between /s ʃ/, especially among monolingual speakers
* Delabialization of labialized velars (/kʷ gʷ xʷ ɣʷ/), e.g. nəkkʷni/nukkni &gt; nəkkni &#x27;us, we&#x27;
* Insertion of epenthetic [ə] to break up consonant clusters
* Frequent diphthong insertion, as in Judeo-Arabic
* Some varieties have q &gt; kʲ and dˤ &gt; tˤ, as in the local Arabic dialects
* In the eastern Sous Valley region, /l/ &gt; [n] in both Judeo-Berber and Arabic

== Lexicon ==
The lexicon of Judeo-Berber is the same as that of regular Shilha except it has Hebrew and Judeo-Arabic loanwords. This lack of differentiation from Shilha means it is not a language but rather a dialect. Judeo-Berber lexicon also influenced Judeo-Arabic.

==Usage==
Apart from its daily use, Judeo-Berber was used for orally explaining religious texts, and only occasionally written, using Hebrew characters; a manuscript Pesah Haggadah written in Judeo-Berber has been reprinted (Galand-Pernet et al. 1970.) A few prayers, like the Benedictions over the Torah, were recited in Berber.

<text>Guerrero is a state in Southwest Mexico that is divided into 85 municipalities. According to the 2020 Mexican census, Guerrero is the 13th most populous state with inhabitants and the 14th largest by land area spanning .

Municipalities in Guerrero are administratively autonomous of the state according to the 115th article of the 1917 Constitution. Every three years, citizens elect a municipal president (Spanish: &quot;presidente municipal&quot;) by a plurality voting system who heads a concurrently elected municipal council (&quot;ayuntamiento&quot;) responsible for providing all the public services for their constituents. The municipal council consists of a variable number of trustees and councillors (&quot;regidores y síndicos&quot;). Municipalities are responsible for public services (such as water and sewerage), street lighting, public safety, traffic, and the maintenance of public parks, gardens and cemeteries. They may also assist the state and federal governments in education, emergency fire and medical services, environmental protection and maintenance of monuments and historical landmarks. Since 1984, they have had the power to collect property taxes and user fees, although more funds are obtained from the state and federal governments than from their own income.

The largest municipality by population in Guerrero is Acapulco, with 779,566 residents, and the smallest municipality is Atlamajalcingo del Monte with 5,811 residents. The largest municipality by land area is Coyuca de Catalán which spans , and the smallest is Alpoyeca which spans .

<text>Bennet Tyler (July 10, 1783 – May 14, 1858) was an American Congregational clergyman and educator. He served as president of Dartmouth College between 1822 and 1828. His Reformed theology was called &quot;Tylerism&quot;, as opposed to the post-Reformed Taylorism of Nathaniel William Taylor.

==Biography==
To succeed President Daniel Dana, Dartmouth Trustees selected Bennet Tyler, a South Britain, Connecticut, minister and graduate of Yale. Tyler was very devout, and he was especially interested in preaching in the College church, letting others do the teaching. He was successful in endowing the first scholarship at Dartmouth, intended for &quot;the education of pious, indigent young men for the ministry&quot;. He also stabilized the enrollment, which had plummeted during the Revolutionary War.

It was in 1824, during President Tyler&#x27;s administration, that Dartmouth admitted its first African-American student, Edward Mitchell, in 1824.

Tyler returned to the ministry after six years as Dartmouth President. He was a founder, theology professor, and president of the Theological Institute of Connecticut, now Hartford Seminary, from 1834 to 1857.

<text>Edith Blackwell Holden (26 September 1871 – 15 March 1920) was an English artist and art teacher. She was born in Kings Norton, Birmingham. She became famous following the posthumous publication of her &quot;Nature Notes for 1906&quot;, in facsimile form, as the book &quot;The Country Diary of an Edwardian Lady&quot; in 1977, which was an enormous publishing success. These, and her life story, were later the subject of a television dramatization.

==Overview ==
From 1906 to 1909, she taught at a school in Solihull.

Her paintings were exhibited by the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists (1890–1907), and by the Royal Academy of Arts in 1907 and 1917.

In 1911, she married Alfred Ernest Smith, born 1879, a sculptor.

Collecting flowers from a riverbank at Kew Gardens, she drowned in the Thames in 1920.

==Life==

Edith Blackwell Holden (1871–1920) was a British artist and part-time art teacher, known in her time as an illustrator of children&#x27;s books. Much influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement, she specialised in painting animals and plants. Holden was made famous by the posthumous publication, in 1977, of her &quot;Nature Notes for 1906&quot; under the title &quot;The Country Diary of an Edwardian Lady&quot;. She was living in Gowan Bank, Kineton Green Road, Olton, Solihull in 1905–06 when she recorded the notes. The collection of seasonal observations, poetry, and pictures of birds, plants, and insects—which was never even considered for publication when it was composed—had the nostalgic charm of a vanished world seven decades later. It became a world-wide best seller.

=== Early life ===
Edith&#x27;s mother was Emma Wearing, a Spiritualist and Unitarian, and former governess who wrote two religious books, &quot;Ursula&#x27;s Childhood&quot; and &quot;Beatrice of St Mawse&quot;, published by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Her father, also a Unitarian and Spiritualist, was Arthur Holden—owner of Arthur Holden &amp; Son&#x27;s Paint Factory in Bradford Street, Birmingham, noted Town Councillor and charity worker. Edith&#x27;s middle name honoured the pioneer woman physician, Elizabeth Blackwell, also a Unitarian and the Holdens&#x27; cousin. The Holden family attended the Birmingham Labour Church.

Before the death of Edith&#x27;s mother Emma in 1904, the Holden family had become Spiritualists. The Holdens held regular Spiritualist seances at home in Olton, with the intention of communicating with the spirit of their deceased wife and mother. Edith and her four sisters were instrumental in assisting their father with these communications, which culminated in 1913, when Edith&#x27;s father published them in his own diary, entitled &quot;Messages from the Unseen,&quot; only weeks before his own death.

During the 1906–09 school years, Edith Holden taught at the Solihull School for Girls. She fashioned her &quot;Nature Notes for 1906&quot; as a model for her students&#x27; work. Then, like her younger sisters, Holden became an illustrator. She illustrated four volumes, 1907–10, of &quot;The Animal&#x27;s Friend&quot;, a magazine of the National Council for Animals&#x27; Welfare, and a number of children&#x27;s books, including &quot;The Three Goats Gruff&quot;. Her paintings were often exhibited from 1890–1907 by the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists, and by the Royal Academy of Arts in 1907 and 1917.

=== Marriage ===
In 1911 Edith Holden, at the age of thirty-nine, married Ernest Smith, a sculptor, seven years her junior. Smith became principal assistant to Countess Feodora Gleichen. At the Countess&#x27;s studio in St James Palace the Smiths associated with leading artists such as Sir George Frampton, sculptor of the statue of Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, and royal visitors such as King Faisal of Arabia. Edith continued her career as an illustrator; the couple had no children.

=== Death ===
On 16 March 1920, Holden was found drowned in a backwater of the River Thames, near Kew Gardens Walk. On the prior Monday morning Edith had complained to Ernest of a headache, but this was not uncommon and the matter had not been dwelt on. The main subject at breakfast had been the impending visit of some friends for Easter, to which Edith was looking forward. Ernest left for the studio at St James&#x27;s Palace and Edith said that she would probably go down to the river later to see the University crews practicing.

When Ernest returned home that evening, his wife was out, but the table had been laid for the evening meal; Ernest assumed that she was with friends. It was not until the next morning that he learned that her body had been found at six o&#x27;clock on the Tuesday morning. The inquest established that she had tried to reach a branch of chestnut buds. The bough was out of reach, and with the aid of her umbrella, Edith had tried to break it off, fallen forward into the river and drowned.
