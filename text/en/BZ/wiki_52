She was drafted by Phoenix first overall in the 2004 WNBA draft. Taurasi has won the WNBA Rookie of the Year Award (2004), three WNBA championships (2007, 2009, and 2014), six Olympic gold medals (2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, and 2024), one WNBA Most Valuable Player Award (2009), two WNBA Finals MVP Awards (2009 and 2014), five scoring titles (2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011), and three FIBA World Cups (2010, 2014, and 2018).

In 2011, she was voted by fans as one of the WNBA&#x27;s Top 15 Players of All Time, and was named by the league to its 20th and 25th anniversary teams, respectively the WNBA Top 20@20 in 2016 and The W25 in 2021. Also in 2021, she was selected by fans as the league&#x27;s greatest player of all time. On June 18, 2017, Taurasi became the WNBA all-time leading scorer.

Her penchant for scoring in crucial situations has earned her the nickname &quot;White Mamba&quot;, coined by Kobe Bryant. Taurasi is one of 11 women to win an Olympic gold medal, an NCAA Championship, a FIBA World Cup, and a WNBA Championship.

==Early life==
Taurasi grew up in Chino, California. Taurasi&#x27;s father, Mario, was raised in Argentina. He was a professional soccer player in Italy and played for several years as a goalkeeper. Taurasi&#x27;s mother, Liliana, is Argentine. Mario and Liliana Taurasi emigrated from Argentina to the United States before Diana was born. She has an older sister named Jessika.

In high school, Taurasi was the recipient of the 2000 Cheryl Miller Award, presented by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; to the best player in Southern California. She was also recognized as the 1999 and 2000 Ms. Basketball State Player of the Year, the 2000 Naismith and &quot;Parade Magazine&quot; National High School Player of the Year. With 3,047 points, Taurasi concluded her prep career ranked fourth in state history. The Women&#x27;s Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) designated Taurasi a distinct American. She participated in the 2000 WBCA High School All-America Game, where she scored twelve points, and earned MVP honors.

==College career==

Following a highly decorated high school career, Taurasi enrolled at the University of Connecticut and began playing for the women&#x27;s basketball team during the 2000–2001 season. Taking the court primarily at point guard and shooting guard, she led the team to three consecutive NCAA championships. After a poor shooting performance in UConn&#x27;s 2001 Final Four loss to Notre Dame, Taurasi vowed &quot;We will not lose another tournament game while I&#x27;m wearing this uniform.&quot; They proceeded to win three straight national titles, and 18 straight tourney wins. Leading up to the final championship, her coach, Geno Auriemma, would declare his likelihood of winning with the claim, &quot;We have Diana, and you don&#x27;t.&quot;

Taurasi also received many personal accolades at UConn including the 2003 and 2004 Naismith College Player of the Year awards, the 2003 Wade Trophy, the 2003 and 2004 Honda Sports Award and the 2003 Associated Press Player of the Year award. In addition to the national recognition she received while at UConn, Taurasi was held in legendary status by many Connecticut fans. For example, state senator Thomas Gaffey nominated her to join Prudence Crandall as the state&#x27;s heroine. She averaged 15.0 points, 4.3 rebounds and 4.5 assists per game in her collegiate career. During her time at UConn, her team compiled a record of 139 wins and 8 losses. In 2006, Taurasi was a member of the inaugural class of inductees to the University of Connecticut women&#x27;s basketball &quot;Huskies of Honor&quot; recognition program.

==WNBA career==
Following her collegiate career, Taurasi was selected first overall in the 2004 WNBA draft by the Phoenix Mercury, a team that went 8–26 in the 2003 season. At times in her career, she had to play forward because there were shorter players in the starting five on her team. However, she mainly played guard. Also, right before the 2004 season, the Mercury acquired all-star Penny Taylor in a dispersal draft, to strengthen their roster.

In her WNBA debut, Taurasi scored 22 points in a 72–66 Mercury loss to the Sacramento Monarchs. For the season, the rookie averaged 17.0 points, 4.4 rebounds and 3.9 assists per game. Although the Mercury did not qualify for the playoffs, Taurasi was named to the Western Conference All Star team and won the WNBA Rookie of the Year Award.

In 2005, Taurasi averaged 16.0 points, 4.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists per game while battling an ankle injury. She was an All Star for the second straight year, but the Mercury faded down the stretch and again missed the playoffs.

Former NBA coach Paul Westhead became the Mercury&#x27;s head coach prior to the 2006 season and brought his up-tempo style to Phoenix. Their roster was further bolstered by the addition of rookie Cappie Pondexter, the #2 overall selection in the 2006 WNBA draft, forming a Big 3 of Taurasi, Pondexter and Taylor.

2006 would be an historic season for Taurasi as she flourished under Westhead&#x27;s system, leading the league in scoring and earning a third straight trip to the All Star Game. She broke Katie Smith&#x27;s league records for points in a season (741 during the 2006 season). In 2006, Taurasi averaged a WNBA record 25.3 points, 4.1 assists and 3.6 rebounds per game, including a career-high 47 points in a triple overtime regular season victory against the Houston Comets (a then league record). During that game she made a WNBA record 8 three-pointers (which has since been tied by Riquna Williams). Taurasi also set a WNBA record with 121 three-pointers made in a single season. The Mercury finished 18–16, but after losing a tie-breaker with Houston and Seattle, missed the playoffs.

In 2007, Taurasi finally reached the WNBA playoffs. In the first round, the Mercury eliminated the Seattle Storm two games to none. Next, they swept the San Antonio Silver Stars in a hard-fought two-game series and Taurasi advanced to her first WNBA Finals, against the defending champion Detroit Shock. Taurasi, Pondexter and Taylor led the Mercury to their first WNBA title. With this victory Taurasi became the seventh player ever to win an NCAA title, a WNBA title, and an Olympic gold medal. Others who had achieved this were Ruth Riley, Sheryl Swoopes, Cynthia Cooper-Dyke, and fellow Huskies Swin Cash, Kara Wolters, and Sue Bird, with further players added to the list in following years.

Taurasi was a member of the USA women&#x27;s 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, and 2024 gold medal Olympic Basketball Teams.

Taurasi is one of only two players (the other being Cynthia Cooper-Dyke), to win the season scoring title, the season MVP award, a WNBA Championship and the finals MVP in the same season. 

In 2011, alongside being selected to her 7th All-WNBA First Team, she was voted one of the Top 15 players in the fifteen-year history of the WNBA by fans.

In 2012, Taurasi had an injury-riddled season, playing only eight games. She had to sit out the rest of the season with a strained left hip flexor. The Mercury proceeded to finish the season 7–27 as the second worst team in the league.

In the 2014 season, with a supporting cast of all-star power forward Candice Dupree (who was traded to the Mercury in 2010), rising star Brittney Griner (who was drafted 1st overall in the 2013 WNBA draft) and the arrival of new head coach Sandy Brondello, the Phoenix Mercury finished 29–5, setting the record for most wins in a regular season, earning the top seed in the western conference.

Taurasi would continue to be hobbled throughout the season, this time with a hamstring injury which limited her to only 6 games played for the season with very minimal playing time. Without a healthy Taurasi, the Mercury barely made the playoffs as the number 8 seed with a 15–19 record. The Mercury were eliminated in the first round elimination game 105-76 by the Chicago Sky.

In September 2019, Taurasi—who remained under contract with the Mercury—confirmed that she intended to play for the team in 2020.

In August 2023, Taurasi became the first player in WNBA history to score 10,000 career points.

==Overseas career==
Taurasi&#x27;s international career began in 2005 when she played for Dynamo Moscow, a team that had been dominant in the Russian league until the late 90s, and even the 2005 runner-up, but was slowly declining at that time. The Euroleague tournament ended in the quarter-finals, where Dynamo was eliminated by former champions CSKA Samara.
In 2006 Taurasi was recruited to play for the Russian team Spartak Moscow. The team had finished in eleventh place in the Russian league when Shabtai von Kalmanovich decided to buy the team. Kalmanovich was a successful business man with various interests, including women&#x27;s basketball. He had stopped in to see a local women&#x27;s basketball team in Yekaterinburg, and &quot;literally fell in love&quot; with the point guard, Anna Arkhipova. He ended up buying that team, but later decided to buy the Spartak Moscow Region team, and turn it into a top team. He arranged to add a number of top-notch players, who had earned seven Olympic medals between them. Many of the players were European, but the team also included Australian Lauren Jackson and Americans Sue Bird and Taurasi.

The team would go on to win four consecutive Euroleague championships from 2007 to 2010, and Taurasi was named Final Four MVP in 2009 and 2010.

In 2010 Taurasi played for Turkish champion Fenerbahçe, helping the team to repeat winning the national league. On December 24, 2010, Taurasi&#x27;s lawyers revealed that she had tested positive for a mild stimulant; according to her lawyer, Howard Jacobs, the positive test came from an &quot;A&quot; sample, and that testing had been requested on a second &quot;B&quot; sample. Jacobs also was quick to point out that the substance Taurasi tested positive for &quot;was not a steroid or recreational drug.&quot; Until the &quot;B&quot; sample could be tested, Taurasi was provisionally suspended from the Turkish league. In a statement, the Turkish basketball association revealed that the WADA-list banned substance was modafinil. On February 16, 2011, Taurasi was finally cleared of doping allegations. ABC News indicated Taurasi was absolved from all doping allegations and could rejoin her Istanbul team following the retraction from the Turkish laboratory.

In the 2011–2012 season Taurasi played for Galatasaray, the other major team from Istanbul and Fenerbahçe&#x27;s long time rival; Taurasi joined WNBA stars Epiphanny Prince, Sylvia Fowles, Tina Charles and Ticha Penicheiro. The team ended up winning the Turkish Cup but lost to Fenerbahçe in the League Final and was eliminated in the Final Eight quarter-final round of the 2011–12 EuroLeague, again losing a decisive match to Fenerbahçe.

On May 16, 2012, Taurasi signed a contract with UMMC Ekaterinburg, joining fellow WNBA star Candace Parker. The team dominated national and international competitions, winning the 2012–13 EuroLeague (second time for the club), Russian Championship and Russian Cup.

Season 2013–2014 saw the UMMC team repeating in winning Russian Championship and Cup, but falling short in Eurolegue competition, losing in the semifinal game against eventual champion Galatasaray; this was repeated in the 2014–2015 season, with UMMC losing in the Euroleague final against the Czech Republic&#x27;s USK Praha, in a game where Taurasi had to sit out with a broken hand.

The injury and the resulting loss in the Euroleague final played a large role in the decision of UMMC club to offer Taurasi a deal to skip the 2015 WNBA season to rest. Taurasi accepted the deal, giving up her WNBA title defense but returning to the Phoenix Mercury in 2016; her decision caused a debate in the United States about salary policies in women&#x27;s basketball compared to Europe and China, where women&#x27;s teams receive governmental support.

In 2015–2016, Taurasi was back to UMMC, leading the team to its third (and her sixth personal) Euroleague title, while also earning MVP honors.

In 2016–2017, Taurasi would once again return to UMMC, helping the team to its eleventh league championship. Though expected to play through the end of the 2017–2018 season with the team, Taurasi announced her retirement from European competition in December 2017.

Taurasi was selected to be a member of the national team for the World Championships. The team was coached by Geno Auriemma. Because many team members were still playing in the WNBA until just prior to the event, the team had only one day of practice with the entire team before leaving for Ostrava and Karlovy Vary.

<text>Engineering physics (EP), sometimes engineering science, is the field of study combining pure science disciplines (such as physics, mathematics, chemistry or biology) and engineering disciplines (computer, nuclear, electrical, aerospace, medical, materials, mechanical, etc.).

== History ==
The name and subject have been used since 1861 by the German physics teacher J. Frick in his publications.

== Definition and Terminology ==
It is notable that in many languages and countries, the term for &quot;Engineering physics&quot; would be directly translated into English as &quot;Technical physics&quot;. 

In some countries, both what would be translated as &quot;engineering physics&quot; and what would be translated as &quot;technical physics&quot; are disciplines leading to academic degrees. In China, for example, with the former specializing in nuclear power research (i.e. nuclear engineering), and the latter closer to engineering physics. 

In some universities and their institutions, an engineering (or applied) physics major is a discipline or specialization within the scope of engineering science, or applied science.

=== Related Names ===
Several related names have existed since the inception of the interdisciplinary field. For example, some university courses are called or contain the phrase &quot;physical technologies&quot; or &quot;physical engineering sciences&quot; or &quot;physical technics&quot;. In some cases, a program formerly called &quot;physical engineering&quot; has been renamed &quot;applied physics&quot; or has evolved into specialized fields such as &quot;photonics engineering&quot;.

=== Other Meanings ===
A &quot;Physical Design Engineer&quot; or improperly called as &quot;Physical Engineer&quot; is the role of an electrical engineer who is responsible for the design and layout (routing) in CAE, specifically in ASIC/FPGA design. This role could be performed by a person trained in engineering physics if the person has received training in integrated electronics design, but this does not necessarily mean that an engineering physicist is an IC design engineer.

==Expertise==
Unlike traditional engineering disciplines, engineering science/physics is not necessarily confined to a particular branch of science, engineering or physics. Instead, engineering science/physics is meant to provide a more thorough grounding in applied physics for a selected specialty such as optics, quantum physics, materials science, applied mechanics, electronics, nanotechnology, microfabrication, microelectronics, computing, photonics, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, nuclear engineering, biophysics, control theory, aerodynamics, energy, solid-state physics, etc. It is the discipline devoted to creating and optimizing engineering solutions through enhanced understanding and integrated application of mathematical, scientific, statistical, and engineering principles. The discipline is also meant for cross-functionality and bridges the gap between theoretical science and practical engineering with emphasis in research and development, design, and analysis.

== Degrees ==
In many universities, engineering science programs may be offered at the levels of B.Tech., B.Sc., M.Sc. and Ph.D. Usually, a core of basic and advanced courses in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology forms the foundation of the curriculum, while typical elective areas may include fluid dynamics, quantum physics, economics, plasma physics, relativity, solid mechanics, operations research, quantitative finance, information technology and engineering, dynamical systems, bioengineering, environmental engineering, computational engineering, engineering mathematics and statistics, solid-state devices, materials science, electromagnetism, nanoscience, nanotechnology, energy, and optics.

== Awards ==
There are awards for excellence in engineering physics. For example, Princeton University&#x27;s &quot;Jeffrey O. Kephart &#x27;80 Prize&quot; is awarded annually to the graduating senior with the best record. Since 2002, the German Physical Society has awarded the &quot;Georg-Simon-Ohm-Preis&quot; for outstanding research in this field.

<doc id="740551" wikidata="Q329854" url="?curid=740551" title="Abraham Cahan">
<text>Abraham &quot;Abe&quot; Cahan (Yiddish: אַבֿרהם קאַהאַן; July 7, 1860 – August 31, 1951) was a Lithuanian-born Jewish American socialist newspaper editor, novelist, and politician. Cahan was one of the founders of &quot;The Forward&quot; (), an American Yiddish publication, and was its editor-in-chief for 43 years. During his stewardship of the &quot;Forward,&quot; it became a prominent voice in the Jewish community and in the Socialist Party of America, voicing a relatively moderate stance within the realm of American socialist politics.

==Early life and childhood==

Abraham Cahan was born July 7, 1860, in Paberžė in Lithuania (at the time in Vilnius Governorate, Russian Empire), into an Orthodox, Litvak family. His grandfather was a rabbi in Vidz, Vitebsk, his father a teacher of Hebrew and the Talmud. The devoutly religious family moved to Vilnius in 1866, where the young Cahan studied to become a rabbi. He, however, was attracted by secular knowledge and clandestinely studied Russian, ultimately demanding that his parents allow him to enter the Teachers Institute of Vilnius from which he graduated in 1881. He was appointed as a teacher in a Jewish school funded by the Russian government in Velizh, Vitebsk, in the same year.

===Immigration to the United States===
In Czarist Russia, repression from both the government and the Russian Orthodox Church restricted the travel, settlement, and educational opportunities of Jewish subjects, who were subject to discrimination and brutality. By 1879, when Cahan was still a teenager, he had associated himself with the growing radical revolutionary movement in Russia. After the Emperor Alexander II of Russia was assassinated by a member of the Narodnaya Volya in March 1881, all revolutionary sympathizers became suspect to the Russian police. In 1882 the Russian police searched Cahan’s room for radical publications that could be linked to the revolutionaries. The visit from the police prompted the young socialist schoolteacher to join the great emigration of Russian Jews to the United States that was under way (at the time, three quarters of Jewish immigrants to the United States came from the Russian Empire). Cahan arrived by steamboat in Philadelphia on June 6 of 1882 at the age of 21 and immediately traveled to New York City, where he would live for the rest of his life.

== Career ==
In July 1882, barely a month after arriving in the United States, Cahan attended his first American socialist meeting, and a month later he gave his first socialist speech, speaking in Yiddish. Although he found American society to be a vast improvement over life in Russia, he began to express certain criticisms of American conditions from a Marxist perspective.

Cahan quickly mastered English. In addition to writing for various publications, by 1883 he dedicated much of his time to teaching English to working class Jewish immigrants. He taught at the Young Men’s Hebrew Association (&quot;YMHA&quot;) and often incorporated socialist speeches into his lesson plans. He also briefly taught in the English Department at the Orthodox Etz Chaim Yeshiva. Cahan formally joined the Socialist Labor Party of America in 1887. Cahan’s education in Russian and English and his literary and journalistic abilities allowed him to excel as a socialist, and toward the end of his career he was considered a leading figure of the radical Jewish left.

In keeping with his socialist politics, Cahan believed that immigrants needed to combine formal learning with informal studies about local life and community customs to achieve not only an education but also integration into American society. He also encouraged women to use labor and education to elevate their status in society.

===&quot;The Jewish Daily Forward&quot;===

Soon after arriving in America Cahan wrote articles on socialism and science, and translated literary works for the pages of the Yiddish language newspaper of the Socialist Labor Party, the &quot;Arbeiter Zeitung&quot; () Cahan edited the &quot;Arbeiter Zeitung&quot; from 1891 to 1895, and followed that position with an editorship at the paper &quot;Di Tsukunft&quot; () through 1887. Afterward, Cahan was made a full-time reporter for the &quot;New York Commercial Advertiser,&quot; and it was this position as an apprentice of reporter Lincoln Steffens that prepared Cahan for his coming role as a founding editor of the Jewish Daily Forward. Cahan founded the &quot;Forward&quot; while he was still juggling several newspaper jobs and published its first issue in 1897.

The horror of the Kishinev pogrom, which the &quot;Forward&quot; covered extensively, prompted Cahan to take on leadership of the &quot;Forward&quot; full-time in 1903, taking over total editorial control and running the newspaper full-time until 1946. In his years working at the &quot;Forward,&quot; Cahan transformed the self-identified socialist newspaper from an obscure paper with only 6000 readers to the forefront of Yiddish journalism. The &quot;Jewish Daily Forward&quot; became a symbol of American socialism and Jewish immigration, and assumed the role of an Americanizing agent instructing its readers in the social, economic, political, and cultural aspects of the United States. Cahan received criticism from fellow Jewish journalists because he didn’t limit the Forward to Jewish topics, but wrote on a variety of themes and was one of the more temperate voices in the Socialist Party of America, respecting his readers&#x27; religious beliefs and preaching an increasingly moderate and reformist form of socialist politics as time progressed.

&quot;The Forward&quot; was also home to an early and long running advice column for Jewish immigrants, A Bintel Brief.

=== Fiction writing ===

Cahan distinguished himself through not only Yiddish literature but also his English fiction that dealt with the sociological and historical process of immigrants becoming Americans. By 1896, Cahan had published his first short story, “A Providential Match”, and just a year later he published his first novel, &quot;&quot; (later filmed as &quot;Hester Street&quot;). By 1901, Cahan had published six of his stories in a variety of popular magazines. Cahan’s most popular novel was &quot;The Rise of David Levinsky&quot;, a semi-autobiographical account that mirrored Cahan’s own experiences of immigration, describing a Jewish immigrant&#x27;s process of Americanization and showcasing the Jewish-socialist cultural establishments in New York.

==Death and legacy==
Cahan died of congestive heart failure on August 31, 1951, at the age of 91, in Beth Israel Hospital in New York City. He was buried in Mount Carmel Cemetery in Queens, New York.

Cahan’s education of immigrants, his work through the Jewish Daily Forward, and his commitment to socialism influenced the Jewish immigrants in New York who came into contact with his work. In addition to influencing American Jewish culture, his works were published in Russia, leaving a mark on the Russian Jewish workers&#x27; movement.

<doc id="740558" wikidata="Q1839849" url="?curid=740558" title="List of airports in Thailand">
<text>This is a list of [[airport]]s in [[Thailand]]. There are 39 commercial service airports in Thailand, 10 of which are international airports. The Department of Airports (DOA) manages 29 airports, while 7 airports are managed by Airports of Thailand (AOT), 3 airports are managed by Bangkok Airways (BA), and 1 airport is managed by the Royal Thai Navy (RTNV). The six major international airports managed by AOT are the main gateways to Thailand for international travelers, while smaller commercial airports may be operated by the DOA or individual airlines. Thailand also has military and private airports that serve various purposes, such as supporting military operations, private aircraft operations, and general aviation.

== Classification of airports ==
=== Flight accommodation ===
Airports can be classified according to the types of flights they accommodate. There are two main categories:
#International airports: Serve regular international flights and operate 24/7. Have ICAO-standard customs and immigration services, as well as ground facilities for handling passengers, cargo, and mail. Can be classified into two types based on their capacity:
##Primary international airports: Provide regular facilities and services for international flights.
##Secondary international airports: Provide limited facilities and services for international flights.
#Domestic/National airports: Cater exclusively to domestic flights, without international flights.

=== CAAT classification ===
The Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT) has classified Thailand airports into four categories based on their location in large cities and passenger traffic. The four categories are as follows:
#Primary hub airports: These airports have a passenger traffic of over 25 million per year and are located in Bangkok. They are the main hubs of transport and connectivity in Thailand and offer a wide range of facilities and services for both domestic and international flights.
#Secondary hub airports: These airports have a passenger traffic between 5 and 25 million per year and are located in popular tourist destinations. They offer a range of facilities and services for both domestic and international flights, but with fewer options than primary hub airports. 
#Regional airports: These airports have a passenger traffic between 1 and 5 million per year and are located in smaller cities or popular tourist destinations. They offer limited facilities and services for both domestic and international flights.
#Local airports: These airports have a passenger traffic of less than 1 million per year and are located in small towns or remote areas. They offer very limited facilities and services for domestic flights only.

== List of airports ==
=== Other airports ===
This list includes airports other than the 39 airports listed above, without scheduled services, military airports, as well as airports and airstrips used solely for general aviation.
===Under construction, approved and proposed===
This list includes airports that are currently under construction, as well as those that have been approved and are in the planning stages.

<doc id="740560" wikidata="Q4828058" url="?curid=740560" title="Avenger (pulp-magazine character)">
<text>The Avenger is a fictional character whose original adventures appeared between September 1939 and September 1942 in the pulp magazine &quot;The Avenger&quot;, published by Street &amp; Smith, which ran 24 issues. Five additional short stories were published in &quot;Clues Detective&quot; magazine (1942–1943), and a sixth novelette in &quot;The Shadow&quot; magazine in 1943. Decades later, newly written pastiches were commissioned and published by Warner Brothers&#x27; Paperback Library from 1973 to 1974.

The Avenger was a pulp hero who combined elements of Doc Savage and The Shadow. The authorship of the pulp series was credited by Street &amp; Smith to Kenneth Robeson, the same byline that appeared on the Doc Savage stories. Most of the original Avenger stories were actually written by Paul Ernst. The &quot;Kenneth Robeson&quot; name was a house pseudonym used by a number of different Street &amp; Smith writers.

==History==
In the late 1930s following in the wake of a slew of magazine cancellations (&quot;The Skipper&quot;, &quot;Bill Barnes&quot; and &quot;The Whisperer&quot; &quot;had failed to capture the audience loyalty&quot; of Doc Savage and the Shadow), Street &amp; Smith&#x27;s circulation manager Henry William Ralston and editor John L. Nanovic set out to create a new hero combining elements of both. They obtained advice from Lester Dent and Walter B. Gibson in the creation of the Avenger, and hired writer Paul Ernst. Both Dent and Gibson met with Ernst to give him advice on his stories, Dent focused on characterization and Gibson on plotting. The character of the Avenger, described by pulp expert Don Hutchison as &quot;clearly an effort to form a hybrid of the company&#x27;s more successful creations&quot;, echoed his forebears in other ways also. Whereas Doc Savage was known as &quot;The Man of Bronze&quot;, the Avenger was described as &quot;The Man of Steel&quot;. The Avenger&#x27;s &quot;marksman&#x27;s eyes&quot; echoed the &quot;burning eyes&quot; of the Shadow, who continued to be referred to as &quot;The &quot;Masked&quot; Avenger&quot;.

When creating The Avenger, Paul Ernst drew on elements from characters he had previously created; Seekay (a private detective with a disfigured face who wears a plastic mask); The Wraith (a crimefighter who used both a knife and a gun); Dick Bullitt (with his gray features); Old Stone Face (the G-Man with the emotionless visage); the Gray Marauder and Karlu the Mystic.

In 1939, readers of Street &amp; Smith&#x27;s &quot;Doc Savage&quot; pulp magazine &quot;thrilled to a special announcement&quot; that a new periodical — &quot;The Avenger&quot; — &quot;was soon to be published&quot;, and would feature stories &quot;written by none other than Kenneth Robeson, &#x27;the familiar creator of Doc Savage&#x27;.
Robeson was actually a Street &amp; Smith house name used by Ernst and a number of other authors, including Lester Dent, the actual writer of Doc Savage. The first issue of &quot;The Avenger&quot; was cover-dated September 1939, and featured a cover story/&quot;lead novel&quot; entitled &quot;Justice Inc.&quot; Interior art was produced by Paul Orban, well known to pulp fans for his &quot;similar work on Doc Savage and The Shadow&quot;.

===Pulp demise===
Describing the stories as &quot;well-plotted&quot; with good characterization and &quot;an unusual amount of attention paid to detail&quot;, Hutchison notes that as a derivative character, the Avenger was destined not to be as popular as his original rivals, which Hutchison gives as Doc Savage, The Spider, G-8, The Shadow, Operator #5 and the Phantom, while still arguing that the character &quot;can perhaps be considered the last of the great pulp heroes&quot;. His stories ran initially in his own magazine for 24 issues, first monthly and then (beginning with #13) bi-monthly in four volumes. The entire series ran exactly three years, ceasing publication in September 1942. The character was kept alive in &quot;Clues Detective&quot; with five additional short stories written by Emile Tepperman, plus an additional tale by Emile Tepperman which was published as a backup feature in a 1944 issue of &quot;The Shadow&quot;.

In Don Hutchison&#x27;s estimation, the Avenger was following in big footsteps, and hamstrung by appearing too late in the day. Following the &quot;instant justice&quot; of The Shadow, the global stage of Doc Savage and other pulp heroes, the Avenger was, by 1939, &quot;simply an unnecessary commodity&quot;. &quot;Second best[,] he had tried harder ... but the timing was all wrong.&quot; Ultimately, Hutchison concludes, &quot;The world did not require another good ten-cent hero.&quot;

===Revivals===
Nevertheless, the character was revived in the 1970s by Warner Paperback Library, given a brief revival by DC Comics (in comic book form), and was the subject of new short stories in 2008 from Moonstone Books. &quot;(See below)&quot;

==Character biography==

===Origins===
The Avengers real name is Richard Henry Benson, a globe-trotting adventurer who &quot;had made his millions by professional adventuring&quot;: discovering rubber in South America, leading &quot;native armies in Java&quot;, making &quot;aerial maps in the Congo&quot;, mining &quot;amethysts in Australia and emeralds in Brazil&quot; and finding gold in Alaska and diamonds in the Transvaal. Following the pulp archetype of a wealthy hero, despite an internal chronology making them (and Benson in particular) &quot;children of the Great Depression&quot;, the Avenger&#x27;s backstory gave him the funding to ultimately &quot;support [his] crime-fighting appurtenances&quot;.

Deciding to settle down and raise a family in the first Avenger novel (&quot;Justice, Inc.&quot;), Benson&#x27;s plans for a peaceful life as a &quot;world-renowned industrial engineer&quot; are shattered when his wife (Alicia) and young daughter (Alice) are kidnapped and presumably killed (though their bodies are never found) by some criminals during an airplane journey from Buffalo to Canada. The shock of this loss has a bizarre effect on Benson. His face becomes paralyzed while both his skin and his hair turn white, his facial flesh becoming malleable, like modelling clay. His face was thereafter (for the first dozen stories) regularly described (as in &quot;The Smiling Dogs&quot;) as

As a result of this tragedy, Benson vows to avenge himself on the villains, and to fight for all those who have suffered at the hands of criminals.

Don Hutchison suggests that &quot;Benson&#x27;s extreme personal misfortune was probably the strongest motivation accorded any of the great pulp heroes,&quot; stemming as it did from the death of his family and his own &quot;death in life&quot;. The stories, by veteran pulp/magazine writer Paul Ernst &quot;were well-plotted mysteries with mild science-fictional extrapolations&quot;, albeit often appearing somewhat subdued when compared to rival publications such as &quot;The Spider&quot; and &quot;Operator #5&quot;. Benson was &quot;the master of the last-minute escape&quot;, cool and intellectual, mentally &quot;the equal of Doc Savage&quot; but otherwise &quot;an average-sized man&quot;. The plastic, malleable state of his otherwise immobile features allowed the character to physically reshape his face with his fingers into a likeness of any person, his features remaining in sculpted form &quot;until they were carefully put back into place&quot;. This ability, coupled with hair dyes and colored contact lenses, earned him the sobriquet &quot;The Man of a Thousand Faces&quot;.

===New face===
After twelve issues, Ernst was directed editorially to eliminate Benson&#x27;s facial affliction in the hopes that this would bolster the dwindling audience for the magazine. Thus the second &quot;distinct era&quot; of the Avenger began with the first issue of the now-bi-monthly third volume (#13), just over a year after the magazine&#x27;s debut.

The thirteenth issue, &quot;Murder On Wheels&quot;, saw the introduction of the last major recurring character, Cole Wilson. Initially an opponent of the Avenger (before joining Justice, Inc. in the same issue), Wilson trapped the Avenger in a machine which &quot;provided a nerve shock of a different sort&quot;, turning Benson&#x27;s flesh back to normal and his hair black. Although the Avenger still disguised himself after this, he could no longer mold his now normal flesh. Three stories – &quot;Nevlo&quot; (#17), &quot;House of Death&quot; (#15) and &quot;Death in Slow Motion&quot; (#18) – had been written by Ernst prior to this radical shift in character, and underwent rewrites before seeing publication. Although the original texts would place these three stories chronologically earlier than #13, the rewrites serve to fit them into the timelines as published (although some slight original traces remain under the heavy-handed later insertions). Often dismissed as a late addition to the stories, Cole Wilson was to play a greater part in the last dozen pastiches written in the 1970s by Ron Goulart.

===Gadgets===
The Avenger far preferred tricking criminals into &quot;destroy[ing] themselves in traps of their own devising&quot; to killing them himself, allowing writer Ernst to create considerably elaborate plots.

Like Doc Savage, Benson relies on a variety of special gadgets to help him overcome criminals. These include knockout gas bombs, miniature two-way radios, a woven, transparent bullet-proof garment and &quot;glass pellets containing a gas... [which] instantly [spread] a black impenetrable pall like instant night&quot;, also accessible through a stud on Benson&#x27;s collar.

His car rivalled those of the later James Bond series, &quot;being a rather dull 1935 model&quot; capable of speeds up to 130 mph (unheard of at the time), &quot;bullet-proofed throughout and equipped with devices and special little inventions for offence and defence&quot;, including automatic bullet-proofed windows and &quot;miniature torpedoes of potent knock-out gas&quot;.

The Avenger also carried a pair of weapons &quot;strapped in slim sheaths on [his] right and left calf&quot; – his specially streamlined and silenced .22 revolver (&quot;Mike&quot;) and a needle-pointed throwing knife (&quot;Ike&quot;). Using these customized tools, Benson could shoot someone so that his bullet just touched their heads and knocked them out, or &quot;hit a fly-speck from twenty feet&quot;.

===Assistants===
Like Doc Savage before him, Benson rarely underwent his adventures alone, gathering a number of assistants to help him. His small band, known as &quot;Justice, Inc.&quot;, was made up of people who had all been &quot;irreparably damaged by crime&quot;, and who have specialized skills:

* Fergus &quot;Mac&quot; MacMurdie (&quot;Justice, Inc.&quot;) is a stereotypically dour Scotsman who is also a gifted pharmacist and chemist. His family was killed by racketeers, leaving Mac embittered, vengeful and &quot;indifferent to the threat of... death&quot;.
* Algernon Heathcote &quot;Smitty&quot; Smith (&quot;Justice, Inc.&quot;) is a gigantic man (6&#x27; 9&quot;) of incredible strength. Smitty looks slow and stupid, but he is actually a genius with electronics. He was framed – and spent a year in jail – for a crime he did not commit, and initially attacked Benson, believing the Avenger was out to arrest him.
* Nellie Gray (&quot;The Yellow Hoard&quot;), &quot;the Emma Peel of her day&quot;, is a beautiful, delicate-looking young woman who is actually an expert at jujutsu and other martial arts. Her archaeologist father was killed by criminals for the buried Aztec gold he had found. After his murder was solved by Benson&#x27;s Justice Inc., the treasure &quot;became the equivalent of Doc Savage&#x27;s hoard of inexhaustible Mayan gold&quot;.
* Josh and Rosabel Newton (&quot;The Sky Walker&quot;) are an African American couple whose employers were killed by criminals. They often go undercover as domestic servants, making use of the stereotypes of the time to hide their investigative abilities, in &quot;an ironic comment on the image. .. in the films and fiction of the day&quot;. Both are graduates of the Tuskegee Institute (now University), and the couple have children later in the series. (&quot;The Avenger&quot; is notable for its presentation of minorities. While many of the pulp magazines of the time are well known for racist stereotypes, both Josh and Rosabel are always presented as brave, intelligent people of good character.)
* Cole Wilson joins the group near the middle of the series. He is much less distinctive than Benson&#x27;s other assistants and has a light-hearted manner that contrasts the Avenger&#x27;s serious tone, described as having &quot;a streak of Robin Hood in him&quot;.

==Avenger novels and short stories==

===&quot;The Avenger&quot; (1939–1942)===
Novels written by Paul Ernst and published in &quot;The Avenger&quot; magazine. The first thirteen stories are believed to have been published in the order in which they were written. After the considerable changes introduced in &quot;Murder on Wheels&quot; (Nov. 1940), three already-finished stories were reworked by Street &amp; Smith&#x27;s editors to match them to the new format. Since they were reworked, the stories nevertheless follow internal chronology as well as publication order.

The first two volumes appeared monthly (with the exception of the twelfth issue), and featured covers by Harold Winfield Scott (&quot;H.W. Scott&quot;). Volumes III and IV (#&#x27;s 13 through 24) were covered in artwork by &quot;Graves Gladney, Lenosci and Leslie Ross&quot;.

===&quot;Clues Detective&quot; (1942–1943)===
Short stories later written by Emile C. Tepperman and published in &quot;Clues Detective&quot; magazine. Internal dates and references have led some pulp experts to adjust the numbering a bit on Tepperman&#x27;s short stories. These stories by Tepperman were not reprinted in the 1970s, probably due to their brevity.

**25. Death to the Avenger, published September 1, 1942
**26. A Coffin for the Avenger, published November 1, 1942
**27. Vengeance on the Avenger, published January 1, 1943
**28. Calling Justice, Inc.!, published March 1, 1943
**29. Cargo of Doom, published May 1, 1943

===&quot;The Shadow&quot; (1944)===
Short story written by Emile C. Tepperman and published in &quot;The Shadow&quot; magazine, 1944.

**30. To Find a Dead Man, published August 1, 1944

===Warner Paperback Library (1972–1975)===

Following the original 24 pulp novels by Paul Ernst, and the half-dozen short stories written by Emile C. Tepperman (also under the &quot;Kenneth Robeson&quot; pseudonym) in the 1940s, Warner Paperback Library (30 years later) reprinted the original twenty-four Avenger novels in a paperback book format similar to Bantam Books&#x27; successful &quot;Doc Savage&quot; reprint library.

Continuing on after #24, Warner commissioned ghost writer Ron Goulart to write 12 brand new pastiche novels to extend the paperback reprint series to #36, ignoring Tepperman&#x27;s six short stories from the 1940s in favor of brand new book-length tales. The covers for the 1970s Avenger paperback series were initially painted by Peter Caras, and later by George Gross. These fit chronologically after the six Tepperman stories, but were numbered by Warner from #25 through #36 (since Warner skipped over the Tepperman stories). Steve Holland (actor) was the model for Benson on the cover art, as he was for Doc Savage in Bantam&#x27;s paperback reprints of that series.

** 31. The Man from Atlantis, published June 1, 1974

===Moonstone Books (2008– )===
Beginning in the early 2000s, Moonstone Books (under editor/publisher Joe Gentile) have produced a number of prose and comic books based on licensed pulp, detective and other characters, beginning with the Phantom. In 2008, a prose anthology (available in paperback and limited edition hardback) was released containing new stories featuring the Avenger, with covers by Dave Dorman, 1970s paperback cover artist Peter Caras, and a Limited Edition cover by Douglas Klauba. The anthology was edited by Joe Gentile and Howard Hopkins, and featured numerous stories by authors including Gentile, Hopkins, Ron Goulart, Will Murray, Win Scott Eckert, Richard Dean Starr, Tom DeFalco, Paul Kupperberg, Mel Odom, and others.

Moonstone has also announced plans to continue the novel series. To date, they have released one new title.

==Non-pulp==

===Reprints===

In 2009, Sanctum Productions began reprinting only the 24 original pulp novels in near-replica editions. Each issue reprinted two novels and contains the original black-and-white interior illustrations from the pulps as well as the original pulp magazine covers on front and back. This is similar to their current reprint series of Doc Savage and The Shadow.

===Continuations, extrapolations===
The Avenger is mentioned by author Philip José Farmer as a part of his Wold Newton family, and in an essay published in &quot;Myths for the Modern Age: Philip José Farmer&#x27;s Wold Newton Universe&quot; (MonkeyBrain Books, 2005), Chuck Loridans contributes an article entitled &quot;The Daughters of Greystoke&quot; wherein he constructs a family tree linking Nellie Gray to Tarzan and Jane Porter.

In 2008, Moonstone Books produced the first &quot;The Avenger&quot; anthology, featuring stories written by a number of variant pulp fans and writers – including Ron Goulart and the &quot;Myths for the Modern Age&quot; editor Win Scott Eckert.

===Comics===

There have been several attempts to revive the Avenger as a comic book character, beginning in the 1940s in Street &amp; Smith&#x27;s own &quot;Shadow Comics&quot;, but none (to date) have proved particularly successful. The character first appeared in &quot;Shadow Comics&quot; #2 (Feb 1940), and made seven appearances until 1944.

In 1975, DC Comics published a comic called &quot;Justice, Inc.&quot; which starred the Avenger. This was during the time they were also publishing &quot;The Shadow&quot;. The Avenger also appeared in issue #11 of &quot;The Shadow&quot;. The first two issues were based on stories from the pulp magazine. Issues #2–4 were drawn by Jack Kirby (as were the covers to issues #2 and #3). The comic only lasted four issues.

In the 1980s, when DC Comics was again doing &quot;The Shadow&quot;, an &quot;updated&quot; version of the Avenger showed up briefly. In 1989, DC released a two-issue miniseries, in 52-page prestige format, written by Andy Helfer and pencilled and inked by Kyle Baker, titled &quot;Justice, Inc.&quot;. The miniseries revealed the &#x27;truth&#x27; behind the Avenger&#x27;s origin.

In November 2009 the Avenger showed up in the series &quot;The First Wave&quot; spun off from the &quot;Batman/Doc Savage Special&quot;. The Avenger had a backup series in the new &quot;Doc Savage&quot; (2010) comic, written by award-winning thriller novelist Jason Starr. However, several alterations were made to his aides and to Justice, Inc. The series ran in &quot;Doc Savage&quot; issues #1–9, plus he starred in the &quot;First Wave Special&quot;.

In August 2014, the Avenger appeared in a five-part miniseries published by Dynamite Entertainment, titled &quot;Justice, Inc.&quot;, appearing together with The Shadow and Doc Savage. A one-shot issue of &quot;Justice, Inc.&quot; appeared in December, 2014 titled &quot;The Television Killers&quot;.

===Radio===
Similarly short-lived was &quot;an Avenger radio serial carried by Station WHN in New York City and syndicated in other parts of the country&quot;. From July 18, 1941, to November 3, 1942, the pulp novel Avenger was on the air in a series based on the magazine.

&quot;(Script excerpt from The Avenger radio program, airdate: Tuesday, September 9, 1941 9:30–10:00 p.m.)&quot;

MUSIC: (ORGAN) AVENGER HUM WITH CODE

BENSON: Enemies of Justice...This is The Avenger!

MUSIC: UP WITH THEME, THEN SEGUE TO MOOD (KEEP IN BACKGROUND)

BENSON: You who operate beyond the Law... you who seek to wreck the peace of America... BEWARE! I shall crush your power, destroy the vultures who prey upon the innocent and the unsuspecting. I...AM...THE AVENGER!

MUSIC: UP WITH THEME, THEN SEGUE TO MOOD (KEEP IN BACKGROUND)

The Avenger radio show originated from Long Island, NY-based station WHN and was broadcast over a time-span of 62 weeks. It also seems to have aired on many stations across the United States as a transcription series. The 62 weeks refer only to the period during which the program aired, not the number of shows. There were apparently a number of preemptions, due to coverage of sporting events. Most likely, the series consisted of a then standard run of 26 half-hour episodes (plus repeats). Unfortunately, despite the fact that the program was recorded for syndication, the only remaining artifacts of the show are seven scripts.
All of these are from the first nine weeks of the show, one of which is an original script entitled &quot;Tear Drop Tank&quot;. The others are &quot;The Hate Master, River of Ice, Three Gold Crowns, The Blood Ring, The Devil&#x27;s Horns&quot;, and &quot;The Avenger&quot;. All are based on the magazine novels of the same name, with the exception of The Avenger, which is based on the second adventure, &quot;The Yellow Hoard&quot;. None of the scripts mentions the production crew or cast—in fact, the first three surviving scripts do not even list the authors.

The final four remaining scripts (judging by the airdates listed) were all written by Maurice Joachim. Maurice Joachim was an actor and radio scriptwriter, who wrote episodes of the 1940s WMCA-produced Doc Savage series. It is quite likely he also acted on the Avenger, as he was reputed to be a highly versatile actor -– in the mid-1930s he hosted the &quot;Majestic Master of Mystery&quot; program, and played all the parts himself. Only Joachim and the organist were credited in the script, which had the announcer give the credit &quot;with original music by Dick Ballou&quot;.

These directions specified a Morse Code motif for the music, which was echoed in the sound effects. In the scripts earliest scripts, the &quot;Avenger Hum&quot; is mentioned within the episodes, as in them the impression is given that Richard Benson has a radio unit surgically implanted inside him, and thus his entrances are heralded by a carrier wave tone. This somewhat unsettling idea is dropped at some point in the series, with the novels&#x27; compact belt radios used instead.

The surviving scripts do not include the African American characters, Josuah and Rosabel Newton, nor the young Cole Wilson.

<text>Weather derivatives are financial instruments that can be used by organizations or individuals as part of a risk management strategy to reduce risk associated with adverse or unexpected weather conditions. Weather derivatives are index-based instruments that usually use observed weather data at a weather station to create an index on which a payout can be based. This index could be total rainfall over a relevant period—which may be of relevance for a hydro-generation business—or the number where the minimum temperature falls below zero which might be relevant for a farmer protecting against frost damage.

As is the case with parametric weather insurance, there is no proof of loss provision. Unlike &quot;indemnity&quot; insurance-based cover, there is no need to demonstrate that a loss has been suffered, however an indemnity insurance policy for weather is a rarely utilized instrument. Settlement is objective, based on the final value of the chosen weather index over the chosen period. If a payout is due, it is usually made in a matter of a few days with the settlement period being defined in the contract.
See Exotic derivatives.

==Overview of uses==
Farmers can use weather derivatives to hedge against poor harvests caused by failing rains during the growing period, excessive rain during harvesting, high winds in case of plantations or temperature variabilities in case of greenhouse crops; theme parks may want to insure against rainy weekends during peak summer seasons; and gas and power companies may use heating degree days (HDD) or cooling degree days (CDD) contracts to smooth earnings. A sports event managing company may wish to hedge the loss by entering into a weather derivative contract because if it rains the day of the sporting event, fewer tickets will be sold.

Heating degree days are one of the most common index types for weather derivative evaluation. Typical terms for an HDD contract could be: for the November to March period, for each day when the daily mean temperature falls below a reference point (65 degrees Fahrenheit in the U.S., or, 18 degrees Celsius outside the U.S.), a cumulative count is kept of the daily departures from the reference temperature. Such an accumulation can be the basis for a derivative contract which might be structured as an option (call or put) or as a &quot;swap&quot; that is an agreement to pay or to receive payment.

==History==
The first weather derivative deal was in July 1996 when Aquila Energy structured a dual-commodity hedge for Consolidated Edison (ConEd). The transaction involved ConEd&#x27;s purchase of electric power from Aquila for the month of August. The price of the power was agreed, and a weather clause was embedded into the contract. This clause stipulated that Aquila would pay ConEd a rebate if August turned out to be cooler than expected. The measurement of this was referenced to Cooling Degree Days (CDDs) measured at New York City&#x27;s Central Park weather station. If total CDDs were from 0 to 10% below the expected 320, the company received no discount to the power price, but if total CDDs were 11 to 20% below normal, ConEd would receive a $16,000 discount. Other discounted levels were worked in for even greater departures from normal.

Weather derivatives slowly began trading over-the-counter in 1997. As the market for these products grew, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) introduced the first exchange-traded weather futures contracts (and corresponding options), in 1999. The CME currently lists weather derivative contracts for 24 cities in the United States, eleven in Europe, six in Canada, three in Australia and three in Japan. Most of these financial instruments track cooling degree days or heating degree days, but other products track snowfall and rainfall in at ten separate U.S. locations. The CME Hurricane Index, an innovation developed by the reinsurance industry provides contracts that are based on a formula derived from the wind speed and radius of named storms at the point of U.S. landfall.

Enron Corporation was one of the first to explore weather derivatives, through its EnronOnline unit.

In an &quot;Opalesque&quot; video interview, Nephila Capital&#x27;s Barney Schauble described how some hedge funds treat weather derivatives as an investment class. Counterparties such as utilities, farming conglomerates, individual companies and insurance companies are essentially looking to hedge their exposure through weather derivatives, and funds have become a sophisticated partner in providing this protection. There has also been a shift over the last few years from primarily fund of funds investment in weather risk, to more direct investment for investors looking for non-correlated items for their portfolio. Weather derivatives provide a pure non-correlated alternative to traditional financial markets.

An online weather derivative exchange Massive Rainfall was created in 2014 and has been used to bet or hedge on specific temperatures, wind speeds and rainfall for specific days in select cities, however it appears to be only an educational tool for practice accounts in a non-existent currency.

==Valuation==

There is no standard model for valuing weather derivatives similar to the Black–Scholes formula for pricing European style equity option and similar derivatives. That is because the underlying asset of the weather derivative is non-tradeable which violates a number of key assumptions of the Black-Scholes Model. Typically weather derivatives are priced in a number of ways:

===Business pricing===
Business pricing requires the company utilizing weather derivative instruments to understand how its financial performance is affected by adverse weather conditions across a variety of outcomes (i.e. obtain a utility curve with respect to particular weather variables). Then the user can determine how much he/she is willing to pay in order to protect his/her business from those conditions in case they occurred based on his/her cost-benefit analysis and appetite for risk. In this way, a business can obtain a &quot;guaranteed weather&quot; for the period in question, largely reducing the expenses/revenue variations due to weather.
Alternatively, an investor seeking a certain level of return for a certain level of risk can determine what price he is willing to pay for bearing particular outcome risk related to a particular weather instrument.

===Historical pricing (Burn analysis)===
The historical payout of the derivative is computed to find the expectation. The method is very quick and simple, but does not produce reliable estimates and could be used only as a rough guideline. It does not incorporate variety of statistical and physical features characteristic of the weather system.

===Index modelling===
This approach requires building a model of the underlying index, i.e. the one upon which the derivative value is determined (for example monthly/seasonal cumulative heating degree days). The simplest way to model the index is just to model the distribution of historical index outcomes. We can adopt parametric or non-parametric distributions. For monthly cooling and heating degree days, assuming a normal distribution is usually warranted. The predictive power of such a model is rather limited. A better result can be obtained by modelling the index generating process on a finer scale. In the case of temperature contracts, a model of the daily average (or min and max) temperature time series can be built. The daily temperature (or rain, snow, wind, etc.) model can be built using common statistical time series models (i.e. ARMA or Fourier transform in the frequency domain) purely based only on the features displayed in the historical time series of the index. A more sophisticated approach is to incorporate some physical intuition/relationships into our statistical models based on spatial and temporal correlation between weather occurring in various parts of the ocean-atmosphere system around the world (for example, we can incorporate the effects of El Niño on temperatures and rainfall).

===Physical models of the weather===
We can utilize the output of numerical weather prediction models based on physical equations describing relationships in the weather system. Their predictive power tends to be less than, or similar to, purely statistical models beyond time horizons of 10–15 days. Ensemble forecasts are especially appropriate for weather derivative pricing within the contract period of a monthly temperature derivative. However, individual members of the ensemble need to be &#x27;dressed&#x27; (for example, with Gaussian kernels estimated from historical performance) before a reasonable probabilistic forecast can be obtained.

===Mixture of statistical and physical models===
A superior approach for modelling daily or monthly weather variable time series is to combine statistical and physical weather models using time-horizon varying weight which are obtained after optimization of those based on historical out-of-sample evaluation of the combined model scheme performance.

== Accounting treatment ==
In contrast to a weather insurance policy and because of its unique nature, the accounting for a weather derivative falls under specialized rules, most notably the Financial Accounting Standards Board&#x27;s (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards #133 (SFAS #133). Because of this rigorous accounting and taxations treatment, any party considering the transaction of a weather derivative should seek the advice of both an accountant familiar with SFAS #133 and the required documentation, as well as a tax attorney.

<doc id="740572" wikidata="Q2352054" url="?curid=740572" title="Wazir Khan Mosque">
<text>The Wazir Khan Mosque (, &quot;Wazīr Khã Masīt&quot;; Persian, ) is a 17th-century Mughal masjid located in the city of Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. 

The mosque was commissioned by the then governor of Punjab, Wazir Khan, during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a part of an ensemble of buildings that also included the nearby Shahi Hammam baths. Construction of the Mosque began in 1634, and was completed in 1641. It is on the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List.

Considered to be the most ornately decorated Mughal-era mosque, Wazir Khan Mosque is renowned for its intricate faience tile work known as &quot;kashi-kari&quot;, as well as its interior surfaces that are almost entirely embellished with elaborate Mughal-era frescoes. The mosque has been under extensive restoration since 2009 under the direction of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and the Government of Punjab, with contributions from the governments of Germany, Norway, and the United States.

== Location ==

The mosque is located in the Walled City of Lahore along the southern side of Lahore&#x27;s &quot;Shahi Guzargah&quot;, or &quot;Royal Road,&quot; which was the traditional route traversed by Mughal nobles on their way to royal residences at the Lahore Fort. The mosque is situated approximately 260 meters west of the Delhi Gate, where the masjid&#x27;s Shahi Hammam is located. The Masjid also faces a town square known as Wazir Khan Chowk, and the Chitta Gate. The mosque hosts the shrine of Saint Sakhi Saif Souf.

==Background==

The mosque was commissioned by the chief physician to the Mughal Court, Hakeem Ilam-ud-din Ansari, better known by his royal title of Wazir Khan. Wazir Khan later became the &quot;subahdar&quot;, or Viceroy of Punjab, and commissioned several monuments in Lahore. Wazir Khan owned substantial amounts of property near the Delhi Gate, and commissioned the Wazir Khan mosque in 1634 in order to enclose the tomb of Miran Badshah, an esteemed Sufi saint whose tomb now lies in the courtyard of the mosque. Prior to the construction of the Wazir Khan Mosque, the site had been occupied by an older shrine to the saint.

The mosque&#x27;s interior was richly embellished with frescoes that synthesize Mughal and local decorative traditions, while the exterior of the mosque was lavishly decorated with intricate Persian-style &quot;kashi-kari&quot; tile work. Wazir Khan&#x27;s mosque superseded the older Maryam Zamani Mosque as the Lahore main mosque for congregational Friday prayers.

Wazir Khan&#x27;s mosque was part of a larger complex that included a row of shops traditionally reserved for calligraphers and bookbinders, and the town square in front of the mosque&#x27;s main entrance. The mosque also rented space to other types of merchants in the mosque&#x27;s northern and eastern façades, and ran the nearby Shahi Hammam. Revenues from these sources were meant to serve as a &quot;waqf&quot;, or endowment, for the mosque&#x27;s maintenance.

Main
Construction of the mosque began under the reign of Shah Jahan in either 1634 or 1635, and was completed in approximately seven years. In the late 1880s, John Lockwood Kipling, father of Rudyard Kipling, wrote about the mosque and its decorative elements in the former &quot;Journal of Indian Art&quot;. The British scholar Fred Henry Andrews noted in 1903 that the mosque had fallen into disrepair.

==Architecture==
The mosque is built on an elevated plinth, with the main portal opening onto the Wazir Khan Chowk. The outer perimeter of the Wazir Khan Mosque measures by , with the long axis parallel to the &quot;Shahi Guzargah&quot;. It was built with bricks laid in kankar lime.

===Decorative elements===
Wazir Khan mosque is renowned for its elaborate embellishment in a style which draws from the decorative traditions from several regions. While other monuments in Lahore from the Shah Jahan period feature intricate &quot;kashi-kari&quot; tile work, none match the enormous scale of the Wazir Khan Mosque.

====Structure====
Bricks facing the mosque&#x27;s exterior are richly embellished with the Persian-style title work known as &quot;kashi-kari&quot;. Façades facing the inner courtyard are richly embellished with motifs and palette which display strong influences from 17th century Persia. Persian-style colours used include (cobalt blue), (cerulean), white, green, orange, yellow and purple, while Persian-influenced motifs include star-shaped flowers and grapevines. The mosque also contains motifs of cypress trees, and is the first Mughal monument to have borrowed this motif from Persia.The façade of the entry portal facing Wazir Khan Chowk is decorated with elaborate tile work and calligraphy that includes verses of the Quran, the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, prayers for the Prophet, and calligraphic insignias. Above the &quot;iwan&quot; entrance to the main prayer hall are verses from the Quran&#x27;s &quot;surah&quot; Al-Baqara written by the calligraphist &quot;Haji Yousaf Kashmiri&quot;.

====Frescoes====
Unlike the contemporary Shah Jahan Mosque in Sindh, the interior walls of Wazir Khan Mosque are plastered and adorned with highly detailed buon frescoes The interior decorative style is unique for Mughal-era mosques, as it combines imperial Mughal elements with local Punjabi decorative styles. The main prayer hall contains a square pavilion over which the mosque&#x27;s largest dome rests - a Persian form known as &quot;Char Taq&quot;. The underside of the dome feature frescoes depicting trees in pairs, pitchers of wine, and platters of fruit, which are an allusion to the Islamic concept of Paradise.

====Architectural embellishments====

The arched niche at the mosque&#x27;s entrance facing Wazir Khan Chowk is richly decorated with floral motifs, and features one of Lahore&#x27;s first examples of a muqarna - an architectural element found at the Alhambra in Spain, as well as on several imperial mosques in Iran. The low domes over the prayer hall reflect the style of the earlier Lodi dynasty, which ruled Lahore prior to the Mughal era.

===Entrance===
Entry into Wazir Khan Mosque is through a large Timurid-style &quot;Iwan&quot; over a smaller portal which faces the Wazir Khan Chowk. The &quot;iwan&quot; is flanked by two projecting balconies. Above the &quot;iwan&quot; is the Arabic Islamic declaration of faith written in intricate tilework. The panels flanking the &quot;iwan&quot; contain Persian quatrains written by the calligraphist Muhammad Ali, who was a disciple of the Sufi saint Mian Mir. The panel on the right of the &quot;iwan&quot; reads: 
While the panel to the left of the &quot;iwan&quot; reads:
Entry through the small portal leads into a covered octagonal chamber which lies in the centre of the mosque&#x27;s &quot;Calligrapher&#x27;s Bazaar.&quot; The octagonal chamber lies in the centre of what is the first example of the Central Asian &quot;charsu bazaar&quot; concept, or four-axis bazaar, to be introduced into South Asia. Two of the four axes are aligned as the Calligrapher&#x27;s Bazaar, while the other two align in a straight line from the mosque&#x27;s entry portal, to the centre of the main prayer hall.

===Courtyard===

Passage through the portal and octagonal chamber leads into the mosque&#x27;s central courtyard. The courtyard measures approximately 160 feet by 130 feet, and features high arched galleries surrounding a central brick paved courtyard - a typical feature of imperial Persian mosques in Iran.

The mosque&#x27;s courtyard contains a pool used for the Islamic ritual washing, wudu that measures 35 feet by 35 feet. The courtyard features a subterranean crypt which contains the tomb of the 14th century Sufi saint Syed Muhammad Ishaq Gazruni, also known by the name &quot;Miran Badshah&quot;.

The courtyard is flanked on four sides by 32 &quot;khanas&quot;, or small study cloisters for religious scholars. The mosque&#x27;s four 107 foot tall minarets are located in each corner of the courtyard.

===Main prayer hall===
The mosque&#x27;s prayer hall lies at the westernmost portion of the site, and is approximately 130 feet long and 42 feet wide. It is divided into five sections aligned into a single long aisle running north to south, similar to the prayer hall at the older Mosque of Mariyam Zamani Begum.

The central section of the prayer hall is topped by a 31 foot tall dome with a diameter of 23 feet resting upon four arches that form a square pavilion - a Persian architectural form known as a &quot;Char Taq&quot;. The remaining compartment in the prayer hall are topped by a 21 foot tall dome with a diameter of 19 feet, built in a style similar to that of the earlier Lodi dynasty. The northernmost and southernmost compartments also contain small cells which house spiral staircases that lead to the rooftop.
Walls of the prayer hall&#x27;s interior are also decorated with calligraphy in both Arabic and Persian. Each wall is divided further, and contain unique mosaic designs. The acoustic properties of the dome allow for the imam&#x27;s sermon to be projected across the mosque&#x27;s courtyard.

==Conservation==
The mosque complex is listed on the Protected Heritage Monuments of the Archaeology Department of Punjab. In 1993 the site was added to UNESCO&#x27;s tentative list for World Heritage Site status. In 2004, the Government of Punjab embarked on conservations and restoration efforts for the mosque. In 2007, the Aga Khan Trust for Culture partnered with the Government of Punjab to restore the monument, and in 2009 began a two year long in-depth survey of the mosque as part of a larger effort to restore the Walled City of Lahore. In 2015, the site was mapped in 3D through a partnership between the Lahore University of Management Sciences and the United States Agency for International Development.

===Restoration===
Restoration works at Wazir Khan Mosque began in 2004.

In 2012, the &quot;Pilot Urban Conservation and Infrastructure Improvement Project—the Shahi Guzargah Project&quot; was launched by the Government of Punjab and the Aga Khan Trust for culture which restored a section of &quot;Shahi Guzargah&quot; between the mosque and Delhi Gate. The project was completed in 2015 with support from the governments of Norway and the United States of America.

Prior to completion of the project&#x27;s first phase, the vicinity around the Wazir Khan mosque had been encroached upon by illegally erected shops which blocked off much of the mosque from the surrounding neighbourhood. Tangled power lines further spoiled views of the mosque, and the Wazir Khan Chowk had been badly neglected and had shrunk in size due to illegally constructed shops. The first phase of the project removed illegally constructed shops, restoring views of the mosque. Wazir Khan Chowk was extensively rehabilitated by removal of encroachments, while the well of &quot;Dina Nath&quot; was restored. Power lines along the project corridor were also placed underground, and the Chitta Gate at the eastern entrance to Wazir Khan Chowk was rehabilitated.

<text>A throwing knife is a knife that is specially designed and weighted so that it can be thrown effectively. They are a distinct category from ordinary knives.

Throwing knives are used by many cultures around the world, and as such different tactics for throwing them have been developed, as have different shapes and forms of throwing knife.

Throwing knives are also used in sideshow acts and sport.

==Central Africa==

Throwing knives saw use in central Africa. The wide area they were used over means that they were referred to by a number of names such as Onzil, Kulbeda, Mambele, Pinga, and Trombash. These weapons had multiple iron blades and were used for warfare and hunting. A maximum effective range of about has been suggested. The weapon appears to have originated in central Sudan somewhere around 1000 AD from where it spread south. It has however been suggested that the same weapon is depicted in Libyan wall sculptures dating around 1350 BC.

The throwing knives were extensively collected by Europeans with the result that many European and American museums have extensive collections. However the collectors generally failed to record the origin of the blades or their use. As a result, the history and use of the throwing knives is poorly understood. A further complication is that the label &quot;Throwing knife&quot; was attached by ethnographers to various objects that didn&#x27;t fit into other weapon categories even though they may not have been thrown.

==Western tradition==

Throwing knives are commonly made of a single piece of steel or other material, without handles, unlike other types of knives. The knife has two sections, the &quot;blade&quot; which is the sharpened half of the knife and the &quot;grip&quot; which is not sharpened. The purpose of the grip is to allow the knife to be safely handled by the user and also to balance the weight of the blade.

Throwing knives are of two kinds, balanced and unbalanced. A balanced knife is made in such a way that the center of gravity and the geometrical center of the knife (the centroid) are the same. The trajectory of a thrown knife is the path of the center of gravity through the air. When a balanced knife is thrown, the circles described by the point and the end of the hilt as the knife rotates about the center of gravity will have the same diameter, making the trajectory more predictable. For an unbalanced knife, the circles described will have different diameters, meaning that the point and the end of the hilt will hit a target in different locations at any point along the trajectory. This makes predicting the trajectory more difficult.

Balanced knives can be thrown by gripping either the point or the hilt, depending upon the user&#x27;s preference and the distance to the target. Unbalanced knives are generally thrown by gripping the lighter end. There are also knives with adjustable weights which can slide on the length of the blade. This way, it can function both as a balanced or unbalanced knife depending upon the position of the weight. Balanced knives are generally preferred over unbalanced ones for two reasons: a) Balanced knives can be thrown from the handle as well as from the blade, and b) it is easier to change from one balanced knife to another.

The weight of the throwing knife and the throwing speed determine the power of the impact. Lighter knives can be thrown with relative ease, but they may fail to penetrate the target properly, resulting in &quot;bounce back&quot;. Heavy throwing knives are more stable in their flight and cause more damage to the target, but more strength is needed to throw them accurately.

Hans Talhoffer (c. 1410-1415 – after 1482) and Paulus Hector Mair (1517–1579) both mention throwing daggers in their treaties on combat and weapons. Talhoffer specifies a type of spiked dagger for throwing while Mair describes throwing the dagger at your opponent&#x27;s chest.

<text>Abraham Jacobi (6 May 1830 – 10 July 1919) was a German physician and pioneer of pediatrics. He was a key figure in the movement to improve child healthcare and welfare in the United States and opened the first children&#x27;s clinic in the country. To date, he is the only foreign-born president of the American Medical Association. He helped found the &quot;American Journal of Obstetrics&quot;. He is regarded as the &quot;Father of American Pediatrics&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Hartum (now a district of Hille), Westphalia, he was the son of a poor Jewish shopkeeper and his wife, who educated him at great sacrifice. He attended the gymnasium in Minden. After graduating there, he studied medicine at the universities of Greifswald, Göttingen, and Bonn, receiving a Doctor of Medicine at Bonn in 1851. Shortly thereafter, Jacobi joined the revolutionary movement in Germany (see Revolution of 1848). He was detained in prisons at Berlin and Cologne in 1851, where he was acquitted as defendant in the Cologne Communist Trial in 1852. Later he was imprisoned at Bielefeld and Minden, where he was convicted of lese Majeste in 1853.

Upon release, Jacobi sailed to England, where he stayed with both Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. In the following autumn he moved to New York City where he settled as a practicing physician. He soon became a key figure in the movement to improve child healthcare and welfare in the United States.

He remained in contact with Marx and Engels and in 1857 Jacobi was involved in founding the New York Communist Club.

Starting in 1861 at New York Medical College, he was a professor of childhood diseases. From 1867 to 1870, he was chair of the medical department of the University of the City of New York. He taught at Columbia University for 30+ years from 1870 to 1902. He later moved to Mount Sinai Hospital, where he established the first Department of Pediatrics at a general hospital.

He was president of the New York Pathological and Obstetrical Societies, and twice of the Medical Society of the County of New York, visiting physician to the German Hospital beginning 1857, to Mount Sinai Hospital beginning 1860, to the Hebrew Orphan Asylum and the infant hospital on Randall&#x27;s Island beginning 1868, and to Bellevue Hospital beginning 1874. In 1882 he was president of the New York State Medical Society, and in 1885 became president of the New York Academy of Medicine. From 1868 to 1871, he was joint editor of the &quot;American Journal of Obstetrics and Diseases of Women and Children&quot;.

Civic work was an important part of his life. He advocated for birth control and civil service reform, and opposed prohibition. Jacobi was strongly anti-Hohenzollern during World War I. In the summer of 1918, a house fire destroyed the manuscript of his autobiography, and other personal papers at his Lake George home.

He died on 10 July 1919 at his summer home in Bolton Landing at age 89. Jacobi is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

==Family==
His first wife, Fanny Meier (1833−1856), was a sister of Sophie Meyer Boas (1828−1916), the mother of ethnologist Franz Boas, who also attended the gymnasium in Minden. In 1873, he married Mary Putnam, also a physician. She was the very first female student at the in Paris, France. They had three children, only one of whom—Marjorie—survived to adulthood.

<doc id="740603" wikidata="Q5379074" url="?curid=740603" title="Enlightenment (Doctor Who)">
<text>Enlightenment is the fifth serial of the 20th season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was originally broadcast in four twice-weekly parts on BBC1 from 1 to 9 March 1983. It was the 127th serial of the series, and was written by Barbara Clegg and directed by Fiona Cumming, making it the first serial to be both written and directed by women.

In the serial, the alien time traveller the Fifth Doctor (Peter Davison) and his companions Tegan Jovanka (Janet Fielding) and Vislor Turlough (Mark Strickson) encounter a group of god-like immortals who are racing historical sailing vessels from Earth through space, crewed by humans they had plucked out of time, in an attempt to win the prize of enlightenment. Turlough is under the control of the Black Guardian (Valentine Dyall), but struggles with the Guardian&#x27;s orders to kill the Doctor. &quot;Enlightenment&quot; is the third of three loosely connected serials where the Black Guardian attempts to compel Turlough to kill the Doctor.

The serial&#x27;s production was beset by problems caused by industrial action taken by electricians at the BBC during filming. It was eventually finished three months behind schedule, but the unavailability of several actors for new filming dates forced the production team to recast their parts at short notice. &quot;Enlightenment&quot; averaged 6.8 million viewers per episode on its first transmission and received generally positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
Following interference from both the White and Black Guardians, the Fifth Doctor materialises the TARDIS in what appears to be the hold of an Edwardian yacht, though the Doctor senses something is amiss. The human crew have no idea how they got there nor where they are, but know they are taking part in a race. The Doctor and his companions, Tegan and Turlough, discover that the yacht and several other historical Earth ships are competing in a solar sail race through the Solar System. The ship&#x27;s officers reveal themselves to be &quot;Eternals&quot;, in contrast to the Doctor and the humans, whom they somewhat dismissively call &quot;Ephemerals&quot;. The Eternals live in the &quot;trackless wastes of eternity&quot; and rely on Ephemerals for their thoughts and ideas. This race is being held by the Guardians and the prize is Enlightenment, the wisdom to know everything. The Doctor finds that the Eternals have made his TARDIS vanish, forcing him and his companions to stay until the race&#x27;s conclusion.

As the race continues, several of the vessels are destroyed by explosions. The Doctor suspects that the crew aboard the &quot;Buccaneer&quot;, which is a 17th-century pirate ship, is responsible, as it was the closest vessel at the time of destruction. Turlough, while attempting to escape control of the Black Guardian, ends up aboard the &quot;Buccaneer&quot;, and meets the Eternal Captain Wrack, professing his desire to join her crew and learning she too is working for the Black Guardian. He finds equipment aboard her ship that appears to be the source of the device destroying the other ships and hears the Black Guardian&#x27;s voice nearby. Later, Wrack offers the Edwardian officers a reception aboard her ship. During the reception, Turlough demonstrates the Wrack&#x27;s advantage-providing equipment to the Doctor, while Wrack hypnotizes Tegan and implants Tegan&#x27;s tiara (Tegan and Marriner attend Captain Wrack&#x27;s reception in full Edwardian costume) with a red crystal. After the reception and continuation of the race, the Doctor sees the &quot;Buccaneer&quot; nearing the Edwardian ship, determines that the red crystal is used as a focal point of the weapon, and gets rid of the tiara before Wrack can destroy the ship.

Nearing the end of the race, the solar winds dissipate and the &quot;Buccaneer&quot; pulls ahead of the Edwardian ship. Not wishing to see Wrack win, the Eternals return the TARDIS to the Doctor, allowing him to travel to the &quot;Buccaneer&quot;. However, he is captured, and Wrack&#x27;s first mate suggests that the Doctor be thrown overboard. From the Edwardian ship, Tegan and the others watch as two bodies are ejected from the &quot;Buccaneer&quot; just before it crosses the finish line.

The ships and their human crews are returned to Earth and the Guardians dismiss the other Eternals. It is revealed that the Doctor won the race, with Wrack and her first mate having suffered &quot;an unfortunate accident&quot;. The Doctor refuses the prize, but as Turlough helped the Doctor, he is entitled to a portion of the prize. The Black Guardian reminds Turlough of their bargain, and says that he can give up the diamond, or sacrifice the Doctor to gain both Enlightenment and the TARDIS. Turlough hurls the diamond at the Black Guardian, who vanishes in screams and flames. The Doctor points out that Enlightenment was not the diamond, but the choice itself.

===Continuity===
To commemorate the show&#x27;s anniversary, every story during Season 20 included the return of an enemy from the Doctor&#x27;s past. During this trilogy (begun in the serial &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot;, and concluding with &quot;Enlightenment&quot;), the enemy was the Black Guardian, who was last encountered by the fourth incarnation of the Doctor at the conclusion of The Key to Time saga in the 1979 serial &quot;The Armageddon Factor&quot;. The story also saw the return of the White Guardian, who had also not been seen since 1979.

==Production==

===Conception and writing===
After penning a number of radio and TV scripts, including episodes of &quot;Crossroads&quot; and &quot;Waggoner&#x27;s Walk&quot;, Barbara Clegg submitted a story idea to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; script editor Eric Saward, an acquaintance from the BBC drama department. Interested in writing for the series, Clegg had been inspired when distant relatives had stayed with her and demanded constant entertainment during their visit, basing the character of the Eternals upon them. Initially titled &quot;The Enlighteners&quot;, her submission involved ships racing through space that, with the addition of the Black Guardian sub-plot, eventually evolved into the story as screened. Saward and series producer John Nathan-Turner liked Clegg&#x27;s ideas, and they commissioned the script in September 1981.

The first episode was delivered by Clegg in October and the three following episodes arriving in January 1982. The serial was now scheduled to conclude a three-story trilogy featuring the Black Guardian, and Clegg duly wrote the recurring characters into her scripts. By May 1982 there were problems with a script by Pat Mills, &quot;Song of the Space Whale&quot;, which had been intended to open the Black Guardian trilogy. Mills&#x27; script was eventually dropped and the production team considered moving &quot;The Enlighteners&quot; forward in the season to replace it, necessitating considerable re-writes. Peter Grimwade was eventually commissioned to write &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot; to replace &quot;The Song of the Space Whale&quot;, and &quot;The Enlighteners&quot; was confirmed as the fifth serial of the season.

The first draft of Part One did not contain any of the material concerning the Guardians, and Turlough was a peripheral figure, with the script focussing on the relationship between Marriner and Tegan. With pre-production underway, Saward changed the story title to &quot;Enlightenment&quot; in September 1982, a title he felt was more enigmatic. Saward also rewrote portions of the script pertaining to the story-arc, particularly the final confrontation scenes at the end of Part Four. Peter Moffatt had been originally scheduled as the serial&#x27;s director, but following the problems with the &quot;Space Whale&quot; script he was asked to helm its replacement due to his experience, and so Fiona Cumming was asked to take over &quot;Enlightenment&quot;.

Once production began it became apparent that Part One and Part Two were under-running so more dialogue was written to fill in the time. It was originally intended that the character of Jackson would not reappear after the second episode, but during filming Saward became concerned that it appeared that he had been executed and so he and Clegg rewrote Part Three to include him. Part Three also looked to be under running so scenes from Part Four were brought forward and the final scenes with the Guardians were extended to compensate.

===Casting===
Cumming came up with the idea that the Eternals would not blink and cast actors who she believed could provide detached performances. Cumming recalled Peter Sallis had played a similarly detached character in the 1974 BBC drama &quot;The Pallisers&quot;, and she cast him in the role of Striker. Sallis was present during the rehearsals for the serial but when production was delayed he was unavailable for the new filming dates, being committed to filming Last of the Summer Wine, and was forced to drop out of the production, being replaced by Keith Barron. Lynda Baron was cast as Captain Wrack, having previously participated in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in the 1966 serial &quot;The Gunfighters&quot; as the voice that sings the &quot;Ballad of the Last Chance Saloon&quot; heard throughout that story. Tony Caunter, who had previously played Thatcher in &quot;The Crusade&quot; and Morgan in &quot;Colony in Space&quot;, was given the role of Jackson, with Christopher Brown and David Rhule being cast as Marriner and Wrack&#x27;s sidekick Mansell respectively. Similarly to Sallis, David Rhule was unavailable for the revised filming dates in January, so singer Leee John replaced him at short notice, despite having no previous acting experience.

Valentine Dyall had originally played the Black Guardian in the 1979 serial &quot;The Armageddon Factor&quot;, the character&#x27;s first appearance in the series, and reprised the role for season 20, appearing in &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot;, &quot;Terminus&quot; and &quot;Enlightenment&quot;. Similarly, Cyril Luckham reprised the role of the White Guardian that he had previously played in the 1979 serial &quot;The Ribos Operation&quot;.

===Design===
The interior sets of the boats were not built specifically for the programme, but were pulled together from stock items from various prop warehouses. Cumming had originally hoped to simulate the rocking of the ships by mounting the sets on rollers but the idea was dropped due to costs, with the effect achieved by moving the cameras instead. The photo of Tegan&#x27;s Aunt Vanessa, one of the items created by Marriner from the contents of her mind, was shot specifically for the filming, requiring Dolore Whiteman (who had played the character in &quot;Logopolis&quot;) to be contracted for a one-day photoshoot. The models of the boats, used in the racing sequences, were props sourced by visual effects designer Mike Kelt following extensive research at the National Maritime Museum. The ships were mounted on rods for filming, while the oars were battery operated. The model of Davey&#x27;s ship remained intact, with its explosion being a filmed effect that was edited into the sequence. Kelt was shocked by the dilapidated state of the TARDIS console prop, and was worried about damaging it while filming the explosion from Part One, and asked producer John Nathan-Turner if he could replace it but was told there was no money available.

The anachronistic wetsuits on the Edwardian ship were actually heavy-duty overalls that had been painted black. Janet Fielding struggled with the low-cut ball gown she wore during filming as it threatened to expose her breasts on a number of occasions. The ball gown worn by Baron was made especially for the serial and was the most expensive costume on display. The newspaper found by the Doctor in Part One was a reprint of &quot;The Times&quot; from September 1901, while the food and drink served during the party scenes was all real.

===Filming===
The serial began principal filming in early November 1982, with filming divided into two main blocks. The first block was shot on film at Ealing Studios between 3–5 November and consisted of the deck scenes and a number of model shots. Actor Mark Strickson was injured while filming the scene of Turlough throwing himself overboard, when the Kirby wire he was suspended from broke, leaving him only able to walk with difficulty for several weeks. The studio work was scheduled to run from 6 November until mid December and consisted of all the interior scenes and those in the TARDIS. By mid-November however the electricians union the EEPTU, had begun strike action which disrupted the filming of a number of BBC productions including &quot;Enlightenment&quot; and potentially meaning the final three serials of the season would have to be abandoned. The electricians dispute was settled by December, but it had badly affected the series recording schedule. The crew were able to shoot the following serial &quot;The King&#x27;s Demons&quot; on schedule, meaning that there was only one recording block left for the part-completed &quot;Enlightenment&quot; and Eric Saward&#x27;s season finale; &quot;The Return&quot;. With some filming already completed, and its importance in concluding the Black Guardian story-arc, it was decided that &quot;Enlightenment&quot; should take precedence and so it had its second production block moved to January 1983, while &quot;The Return&quot; was abandoned. Due to the delays, the serial only finished filming around a month before its transmission date, meaning that composer Malcolm Clarke only received the first episode for scoring a week before broadcast, having to rely on musical cues he had recorded weeks earlier without having seen any footage.

==Themes and interpretation==
Writer Barbara Clegg based the Eternals on a wealthy group of her relatives who, upon visiting her, had demanded constant entertainment, treating other family members almost as &quot;lesser beings&quot;. Clegg drew inspiration from the Bible&#x27;s &quot;Book of Genesis&quot;, deriving the prize of enlightenment from The Tree of Knowledge. Having read about solar winds, she decided to use them as the basis of propulsion for space vessels. Clegg highlighted the nature of enlightenment, showing it not to be knowledge, as the Eternals believe, but wisdom, as demonstrated by Turlough&#x27;s rejection of the Black Guardian.

The episode makes use of a regular science-fiction trope: bored, god-like beings playing with mortals&#x27; lives for amusement. In their book &quot;About Time&quot;, Lawrence Miles and Tat Wood liken this to a prevalent strand of children&#x27;s fiction, where magical worlds are held together by the rules of the children who visit them. Miles and Wood also highlight the political elements of the story, likening the portrayal of the Eternals to the view of the upper classes as &quot;effete parasites feeding off the labour (and in this case the imagination) of the proles.&quot; The Doctor then acts as part of the class struggle, helping the workers gain freedom while the gentry get their comeuppance.

In his essay &quot;Love is a Stranger&quot;, published in the first volume of the &quot;Doctor Who Magazine — Special Edition&quot;, David Bailey highlights the central idea that &quot;The lives of little people are precious, special and worth fighting for... The Eternals may have unimaginable power at their fingertips but they lack, and are jealous of, one thing: the ability to live, and die.&quot; The hollowness of immortality was a thread that ran through Season 20, with the earlier story &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot; showing Mawdryn trapped in an endless cycle of painful regeneration, while in &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;, Borusa&#x27;s prize of immortality results in little more than a living death. The horror of eternal life is brought home when the Black Guardian threatens Turlough with immortality as a punishment for failure, something that drives him to try to commit suicide rather than face eternity.

==Broadcast==
&quot;Enlightenment&quot; was first broadcast in a twice-weekly slot on BBC One during the first two weeks of March 1983. The story episodes averaged 6.8 million viewers, with the highest viewing figures being 7.3 million for the final episode. The episodes averaged 67.5% on BARB&#x27;s Appreciation Index, with Part Four once again achieving the highest figures.

===Archive===
The BBC holds all four episodes on D-3 tape, transferred from the original 2&quot; videotapes.

==Reception==
Reviewing the story for &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&#x27;s&quot; &quot;200 Golden Moments&quot; special edition, Jeremy Bentham described it as being epic in scale, suggesting it played to the original strengths of the series; &quot;performance, period set design and claustrophobic mood&quot;. He likens &quot;Enlightenment&quot; to the work of Stanley Kubrick, saying, &quot;it felt grand, it felt lonely, and yes, it felt epic.&quot; On reappraising the story for the same magazine following its release on DVD, Gary Gillatt was equally as effusive, calling it &quot;one of &quot;Doctor Who&#x27;s&quot; finest serials.&quot; He highlights the performance of Keith Barron as Captain Striker as being &quot;a master class of under-stated menace&quot; and &quot;pitch perfect&quot;, juxtaposing this with the over-the-top pantomime villainy of Lynda Baron as Captain Wrack, with the two captains balancing each other out perfectly.

Writing for the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, Mark Braxton was less enamoured of some of the performances, suggesting that Baron and Valentine Dyall turn in &#x27;hammy&#x27; interpretations of their characters, while Leee John &quot;makes heavy weather of the simplest activities: helming the ship seems to require the most bizarre posturing.&quot; He had mixed views on the story as a whole, saying that &quot;&quot;Enlightenment&quot; has promising components that come together and briefly create a little magic, then vanish again, like ships that pass in the night.&quot; DVD Talk&#x27;s John Sinnott had similarly mixed views on the serial, although conceding that &quot;while it doesn&#x27;t all succeed, they give it a good try and more things work than don&#x27;t.&quot; Sinnott also singled out the performance of Keith Barron for particular praise, along with the relationship between Marriner and Tegan.

In their book &quot;About Time&quot;, Lawrence Miles and Tat Wood have equally mixed feelings about the serial, praising the setting and the performances of Barron and Brown, and suggesting that it &quot;carries on the tradition of putting symbols from the world we know into disconcerting environments... (it) completes the grand illusion of making the history and the fantasy feel like part of the same continuum.&quot; They are less complimentary about other elements however, citing the conclusion as feeling &quot;rushed and tacked on&quot; with too much emphasis on the Guardians and little on the fates of the Eternals. They also dismiss the reveal of enlightenment as being the nature of Turlough&#x27;s choice, as coming &quot;perilously close to tweeness&quot; and accuse it of being &quot;cod-mythologic moralising&quot;.

&quot;Enlightenment&quot; was placed in 72nd position in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Mighty 200&quot; reader survey in 2009, which ranked every &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial to that point in order of preference.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===

A novelisation of this serial, written by story author Barbara Clegg, was published by Target Books in May 1984, with a cover by Andrew Skilleter, and was numbered 85 in the ongoing range. It was the first Doctor Who novelisation to be penned by a woman. On its publication &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; was underwhelmed by the book, claiming in their review that &quot;In many ways, it falls into the familiar Terrance Dicks pitfalls, being a straightforward reworking of the script with &quot;said&quot; following all the speeches. For all its faults, &quot;Enlightenment&quot; remains a good read, simply because of the strength of the story.&quot; The book was repackaged as part of &quot;The Sixth Doctor Who Gift Set&quot; later in 1984, along with three other Doctor Who novels; &quot;The Dominators&quot;, &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot; and &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;.

===Home media===
&quot;Enlightenment&quot; was released on VHS in February 1993. It was subsequently released on DVD as part of the Black Guardian Trilogy, along with preceding stories &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot; and &quot;Terminus&quot; on 10 August 2009. The second disc of the DVD includes a &quot;Special Edition&quot; version of the story; a movie-style edit featuring new CGI graphics throughout, with a newly recorded introduction by director Fiona Cumming. &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; was not enthusiastic about the new edit suggesting, that &quot;what is special about it is up for debate.&quot; The reviewer disparaged the new special effects, stating that &quot;this is ironic as there are few &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories less in need of replacement effects than &quot;Enlightenment&quot;. The original model work is gorgeous, while this substitute material is crude and unsophisticated in comparison.&quot; Alongside the special edition, the DVD contained a number of extra features, including a &quot;Making of...&quot; documentary and extended interviews with director Fiona Cumming, writer Barbara Clegg and actor Mark Strickson, a documentary on the Guardians plus an excerpt from the &quot;Russell Harty Christmas Party&quot; TV special featuring Peter Davison.

<text>George Washington Crile (November 11, 1864 – January 7, 1943) was an American surgeon. Crile is now formally recognized as the first surgeon to have succeeded in a direct blood transfusion. He contributed to other procedures, such as neck dissection. Crile designed a small hemostatic forceps which bears his name; the Crile mosquito clamp. He also described a technique for using opioids, regional anesthesia and general anesthesia which is a concept known as balanced anesthesia. He is also known for co-founding the Cleveland Clinic in 1921.

==Early life==
Crile was born in Chili, Ohio. He graduated from Ohio Northern University in 1885. In 1887, he received his M.D. from Wooster Medical College which merged to form modern day Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. He did further study at Vienna, London and Paris. 

==Career==
He taught at Wooster from 1889 to 1900. He was professor of clinical medicine at Western Reserve University from 1900 to 1911, and was then made professor of surgery. He was chair of surgery at Lakeside Hospital from 1910 to 1924. Crile was responsible for whole blood transfusion, in 1906, and he spurred the use of the new X-ray machines.

During the Spanish–American War, he was made a member of the Medical Reserve Corps and served in Puerto Rico (1898). He was made an honorable F.R.C.S. (London) in 1913. After America entered World War I, he became a major in the medical O.T.C., and professional director (1917–18). He served with the British Expeditionary Force (B.E.F.) in France and was senior consultant in surgical research (1918–19). He was made lieutenant-colonel in June 1918, and colonel later in the year.

He made important contributions to the study of blood pressure and of shock in operations. Realizing that any strong emotion, such as fear before operation, produced shock, he attempted to allay dread by psychic suggestion, also endeavouring to prevent the subjective shock which affects the patient, even when under general anaesthesia, by first anaesthetizing the operative region with cocaine for several days, if necessary, before operating. Thus nerve communication between the affected part and the brain was already obstructed when the general anaesthetic was administered. For his work in shockless surgery he received a gold medal from the National Institute of Social Sciences in 1917.

When he retired from the Medical School at age 65, Crile went into private practice and worked with those establishing the new Cleveland Clinic.

==Personal life==
He married Grace Elizabeth McBride (1876–1948), a sister of David Reed. His son, George Crile Jr., was also a surgeon. His grandson George Crile III was a journalist, author, and CBS producer. 

He died on January 7, 1943, in Cleveland. He is buried in Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio.

<text>Middle of the road (also known by its acronym MOR) is a commercial radio format. Music associated with this term is strongly melodic and uses techniques of vocal harmony and light orchestral arrangements. The format was similar to soft adult contemporary. In the mid-late 2000s the term &quot;middle of the road&quot; became used by journalists as a way to describe musicians and bands such as Train and Westlife who calibrated their musical appeal to commercial, popular music taste and avoided more innovative material.

== Etymology and usage ==
According to music academic Norman Abjorensen, &quot;middle of the road&quot; has referred to a commercial radio format more often than a music genre, although &quot;it has been used to describe a broad type of music&quot; of numerous styles, usually characterized by vocal harmony techniques, prominent melodies, and subtle orchestral arrangements. Radio stations that played adult standards during the 1960s and 1970s were marketed as &quot;MOR radio&quot; in order to differentiate them from Top 40 and rock stations. Middle of the road was famously associated with MetroMedia Radio stations; their flagship station was WNEW 1130 AM in New York. The MOR genre creation was an evolutionary outcome of WNEW&#x27;s reluctance to follow the Top 40 domination and adhere to traditional male and female vocals such as Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Ella Fitzgerald and Peggy Lee. The term &quot;Middle of Road&quot; was the creation of WNEW program director Dick Carr.

Soft rock groups like the Association, the 5th Dimension, the Bee Gees, the Johnny Mann Singers and Simon &amp; Garfunkel infiltrated the MOR market in the late 1960s. In the early 1970s, Bread, the Carpenters and John Denver were notable performers in the middle of the road genre. Writing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: The &#x27;80s&quot; (1990), Robert Christgau said MOR &quot;applied to radio formats that shun or put stringent tempo and volume restrictions on rock, although &#x27;lite&#x27; and &#x27;adult contemporary&#x27; are now the preferred evasions.&quot;

==Traditional format==
The middle of the road music category has traditionally included these genres:

* Easy listening
* Traditional pop and, later, revivalist recordings of the style
* Orchestral ballads
* Show tunes
* Smooth jazz melodies
* Soft rock songs and melodies
* Countrypolitan ballads

==Peak==
As an AM radio format in the United States and Canada, MOR&#x27;s heyday was the 1960s and the 1970s. The 50,000-watt AM radio stations WLW in Cincinnati, Ohio; WJR in Detroit, Michigan; WNEW in New York City, New York; WCCO in Minneapolis, Minnesota; KMPC in Los Angeles, California; KIRO and KOMO in Seattle, Washington; WTIC in Hartford, Connecticut; and Canadian stations CFRB in Toronto, Ontario and CKNW in Vancouver, British Columbia, were known as &quot;full-service MOR&quot; stations with scheduled programming other than the MOR music. Even though it was not a 50,000-watt station, WMAL in Washington DC achieved some of the highest ratings and revenue of all radio stations in the country by programming MOR music, news, sports, and very popular announcers.

In time, as the listener demographic groups aged and popular music migrated to FM radio, MOR stations found themselves competing with adult contemporary FM stations and AM stations broadcasting the Music of Your Life and adult standards formats. In response, most eliminated music and transmitted only news and talk programs; some continued to play MOR music until the early 1990s. MOR (or at least formats bearing a strong resemblance to MOR) were still available as late as 2013; the Memories/Unforgettable Favorites network, a nationwide MOR satellite service, was available until 2006. Many of the styles and genres of music that had traditionally been heard on MOR formatted stations are currently heard on adult standards-formatted stations. The nationally syndicated MeTV FM format, which brands itself as oldies, follows a format similar to MOR.

==Criticism==
In recent years, the term &quot;middle of the road&quot; has been used pejoratively by genre-specific music aficionados to describe musicians who avoid innovative material, and who calibrate their musical appeal to commercial, popular musical taste. Artists such as Westlife (pop), Kenny Rogers (country) and Train (rock) are considered middle of the road.

Moreover, MOR has been used to pejoratively describe a musical band&#x27;s creative and commercial progress from the innovative path to appealing only to listeners who refuse to move beyond their past catalog releases and are resistant to any newly-released music from them. MOR is somewhat often used as a derogatory term for this type of music. For example, &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s review of Duran Duran&#x27;s &quot;Rio&quot; states: &quot;The band peppered the 80s with a number of hot singles (most of which can be found on the unstoppable side A of &quot;Rio&quot;) before departing for MOR country.&quot;, while on a later review of Coldplay&#x27;s &quot;X&amp;Y&quot;, Pitchfork writes that: &quot;U2 recorded &#x27;I Will Follow&#x27;, &#x27;New Year&#x27;s Day&#x27;, &#x27;Bad&#x27;, and &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, among others, before &quot;they&quot; wandered off into the MOR wilderness.&quot;

<text>Charles Frederick Crisp (January 29, 1845 – October 23, 1896) was a British-American politician. A member of the Democratic Party, Crisp was elected as a congressman from Georgia in 1882, and served until his death in 1896. From 1890 to 1895, he led the Democratic Party in the House, as either the speaker of the House or House minority leader. He was the father of Charles R. Crisp who also served in Congress.

==Biography==
Crisp was born in Sheffield, England on January 29, 1845. Later that year, his parents immigrated to the United States and settled in Georgia where he attended the common schools of Savannah and Macon, Georgia. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, he was temporarily residing in Luray, Virginia, with his parents, who were in the middle of a Shakespearean play tour. He enlisted in a local unit, the &quot;Page Volunteers&quot; of Company K, 10th Virginia Infantry, and was commissioned lieutenant. He served with that regiment until May 12, 1864, when he became a prisoner of war at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House. He was held as one of the Immortal Six Hundred at Fort Pulaski, Georgia, and later transferred to Fort Delaware. After his release in June 1865, he joined his parents at Ellaville, Georgia.

Crisp studied law at Americus, Georgia. He was admitted to the bar in 1866 and commenced practice in Ellaville. He was appointed solicitor general of the southwestern judicial circuit in 1872 and reappointed in 1873 for a term of four years. In June 1877, he was appointed judge of the superior court of the same circuit. Crisp was elected by the general assembly to the same office in 1878 and reelected judge for a term of four years in 1880 when he resigned that office in September 1882 to accept the Democratic nomination for the United States Congress.

Crisp courted Clara Bell Burton, born in Ellaville, a small town in southwest Georgia, of wealthy and religious parentage. Her father, Robert Burton, was a slave-owning cotton planter before the war. Both he and her mother held high ambitions for their two daughters&#x27; future, and they were chagrined when Crisp, then a poor lawyer from a theatrical family, desired to marry their youngest daughter, Clara Bell. They were greatly disappointed when they discovered that her affections had been won. Mrs. Burton, especially, felt that her beautiful daughter ought to be more ambitious in marriage. Crisp followed protocol and wrote a formal request to Mr. Burton. In later years, after Crisp had achieved distinction, Burton declared that his son-in-law had never written anything better. But at the time it was to no effect. Crisp requested that a friend ask Mr. Burton if they might be married at her home. Her parents refused, so they had to make other plans. Clara Bell&#x27;s sister Ella assisted with her trousseau. One bright Sunday morning, when she was visiting her brother on the outskirts of Ellaville, Crisp drove Clara Bell in his buggy to his boarding place, and there in the presence of a few friends in the parlor, they were married. The next Sunday, Crisp and his wife joined the Methodist Church of Ellaville. Soon Clara Bell&#x27;s parents reconciled with the couple, and he became the mainstay of their old age. They lived fifty-one years in the same house. Clara Bell, on her death-bed, said: &quot;I cannot think what my life would have been without him... My father and mother came to love him very much. He has been the dearest, sweetest husband to me, and I have loved him better than anything else on earth.&quot;

Crisp served as president of the Democratic gubernatorial convention at Atlanta, Georgia, in April 1883. he was elected a Democrat to the Forty-eighth and to the six succeeding Congresses and served from March 4, 1883, until his death. In Congress, he served as chairman of the Committee on Elections in the Fiftieth Congress, Committee on Rules in the Fifty-second and Fifty-third Congresses, and Speaker of the House of Representatives in the Fifty-second and Fifty-third Congresses. He had been nominated for United States Senator in the Georgia primary of 1896, but he died in Atlanta on October 23, 1896, and was buried in Oak Grove Cemetery in his hometown of Americus. Georgia&#x27;s Crisp County is named in his honor.
==Legacy==
As a former Speaker of the House, his portrait had been on display in the US Capitol. The portrait was removed from public display in the Speaker&#x27;s Lobby outside the House Chamber after an order issued by the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi on June 18, 2020, due to Crisp having fought in the Confederate States Army.

<doc id="740618" wikidata="Q3774744" url="?curid=740618" title="Respiratory arrest">
<text>Respiratory arrest is a serious medical condition caused by apnea or respiratory dysfunction severe enough that it will not sustain the body (such as agonal breathing). Prolonged apnea refers to a patient who has stopped breathing for a long period of time. If the heart muscle contraction is intact, the condition is known as respiratory arrest. An abrupt stop of pulmonary gas exchange lasting for more than five minutes may permanently damage vital organs, especially the brain. Lack of oxygen to the brain causes loss of consciousness. Brain injury is likely if respiratory arrest goes untreated for more than three minutes, and death is almost certain if more than five minutes.

Damage may be reversible if treated early enough. Respiratory arrest is a life-threatening medical emergency that requires immediate medical attention and management. To save a patient in respiratory arrest, the goal is to restore adequate ventilation and prevent further damage. Management interventions include supplying oxygen, opening the airway, and means of artificial ventilation. In some instances, an impending respiratory arrest could be predetermined by signs the patient is showing, such as the increased work of breathing. Respiratory arrest will ensue once the patient depletes their oxygen reserves and loses the effort to breathe.

Respiratory arrest should be distinguished from respiratory failure. The former refers to the complete cessation of breathing, while respiratory failure is the inability to provide adequate ventilation for the body&#x27;s requirements. Without intervention, both may lead to decreased oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia), elevated carbon dioxide level in the blood (hypercapnia), inadequate oxygen perfusion to tissue (hypoxia), and may be fatal. Respiratory arrest is also different from cardiac arrest, the failure of heart muscle contraction. If untreated, one may lead to the other.

==Signs and symptoms==
One common sign of respiratory arrest is cyanosis, a bluish discoloration of the skin resulting from an inadequate amount of oxygen in the blood. If respiratory arrest remains without any treatment, cardiac arrest will occur within minutes of hypoxemia, hypercapnia or both. At this point, patients will be unconscious or about to become unconscious.

Signs and symptoms of respiratory compromise can differ with each patient. Complications from respiratory compromise are increasing rapidly across the clinical spectrum, partly due to expanded use of opioids combined with the lack of standardized guidelines among medical specialties. While respiratory compromise creates problems that are often serious and potentially life-threatening, they may be prevented with the proper tools and approach. Appropriate patient monitoring and therapeutic strategies are necessary for early recognition, intervention and treatment.

==Causes==
*Airway obstruction: Obstruction may occur in the upper and lower airway. 
**Upper airway: Obstruction of the upper airway is common in infants less than 3 months old because they are nose breathers. Nasal blockage may easily lead to upper airway obstruction in infants. For other ages, upper airway obstruction may occur from a foreign body or edema of the pharynx, larynx, or trachea. In cases of decreased or total loss of consciousness, the tongue can lose muscle tone and obstruct the upper airway. Other potential causes of obstruction include tumors of the upper respiratory tract (oral cavity, pharynx, larynx), bodily fluids (blood, mucus, vomit), and trauma to the upper airway. The most common type of tumor of upper respiratory tract is squamous cell carcinoma, with the greatest risk factors for this condition being alcohol and tobacco use, with HPV (genotype 16) being another important risk factor. An epidemiological study of over 5 million cases of head and neck trauma in the United States resulting in visits to the emergency department found that the majority occur due to falls or blunt force, with foreign body injuries being more common in the pediatric population.
**Lower airway: may occur from bronchospasm, drowning, or airspace filling disorders (e.g. pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage). Obstructive conditions of the lower airway, including severe asthma or COPD episodes, can also lead to respiratory arrest. During these episodes, known as exacerbations, airway resistance is increased due to inflammatory changes in the lungs. This leads to increased work of breathing and decreased oxygen delivery to tissue. In asthma, this involves bronchiolar constriction whereas in COPD this involves small airway collapse during expiration and subsequent air-trapping. One of the ways the body attempts to compensate for these increased respiratory demands is by increasing respiratory rate, which in turn worsens respiratory muscle fatigue of the diaphragm and can eventually lead to respiratory arrest and death without timely medical intervention. 
*Decreased respiratory effort: Central nervous system impairment leads to decreased respiratory effort. The respiratory center of the brain is located in the pons and medulla and is primarily driven by elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood (hypercapnia) with decreased oxygen levels (hypoxemia) serving as a less potent stimulus. Central nervous system disorders, such as stroke and tumors, may cause hypoventilation. Drugs may decrease respiratory effort as well, such as opioids, sedative-hypnotics, and alcohol. These lower respiratory drive by blunting the response of the respiratory center of the brain to hypercapnia. Metabolic disorders could also decrease respiratory effort. Hypoglycemia and hypotension depress the central nervous system and compromise the respiratory system.
*Respiratory muscle weakness: Neuromuscular disorders may lead to respiratory muscle weakness, such as spinal cord injury, neuromuscular diseases, and neuromuscular blocking drugs. Respiratory muscle fatigue can also lead to respiratory muscle weakness if patients breathe over 70% of their maximum voluntary ventilation. Breathing over an extended period of time near maximum capacity can cause metabolic acidosis or hypoxemia, ultimately leading to respiratory muscle weakness.
* Cardiac arrest (independent of the underlying reason) will lead to respiratory arrest within minutes.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis requires clinical evaluation, as detailed below.

=== Initial assessment ===
After determining the scene is safe, approach the patient and attempt to converse with him or her. If the patient responds verbally, you have established that there is at least a partially patent airway and that the patient is breathing (therefore not currently in respiratory arrest). If the patient is unresponsive, look for chest rise, which is an indicator of active breathing. A sternal rub is sometimes used to further assess for responsiveness. Initial assessment also involves checking for a pulse, by placing two fingers against the carotid artery, radial artery, or femoral artery to ensure this is purely respiratory arrest and not cardiopulmonary arrest. Checking a pulse after encountering an unresponsive patient is no longer recommended for non-medically trained personnel. Once one has determined that the patient is in respiratory arrest, the steps below can help to further identify the cause of the arrest.

===Clearing and opening the upper airway===

The first step to determining the cause of arrest is to clear and open the upper airway with correct head and neck positioning. The practitioner must lengthen and elevate the patient&#x27;s neck until the external auditory meatus is in the same plane as the sternum. The face should be facing the ceiling. The mandible should be positioned upwards by lifting the lower jaw and pushing the mandible upward. These steps are known as head tilt, chin lift, and jaw thrust, respectively. If a neck or spinal injury is suspected, the provider should avoid performing this maneuver as further nervous system damage may occur. The cervical spine should be stabilized, if possible, by using either manual stabilization of the head and neck by a provider or applying a C-collar. The C-collar can make ventilatory support more challenging and can increase intracranial pressure, therefore is less preferable than manual stabilization. If a foreign body can be detected, the practitioner may remove it with a finger sweep of the oropharynx and suction. It is important that the practitioner does not cause the foreign body to be lodged even deeper into the patient&#x27;s body. Foreign bodies that are deeper into the patient&#x27;s body can be removed with Magill forceps or by suction. A Heimlich maneuver can also be used to dislodge the foreign body. The Heimlich maneuver consists of manual thrusts to the upper abdomen until the airway is clear. In conscious adults, the practitioner will stand behind the patient with arms around the patient&#x27;s midsection. One fist will be in a clenched formation while the other hand grabs the fist. Together, both hands will thrust inward and upward by pulling up with both arms.

==Treatment==
Treatment varies depending on the cause of respiratory arrest. In many cases, it is necessary to establish an alternate airway and providing artificial ventilation that can include modes of mechanical ventilation. There are many ways to provide an airway and to deliver breathing support. The list below includes several options.

=== Opioid-overdose ===
Opioid overdose remains a major cause of death with an increase in rate of death by 12% in the United States from 2016 to 2017. In cases of overdose leading to respiratory arrest, the recommended treatment according to the 2015 American Heart Association guidelines is to administer intramuscular or intranasal naloxone at an initial dose of 0.04-0.4 mg. Dosing may be repeated up to 2 mg if initial dose is ineffective. Special consideration must be taken in individuals with opioid dependency as naloxone administration can induce severe opioid withdrawal, hence the recommended starting doses above. Goal of naloxone therapy is to restore respiratory drive in the individual, however mechanical ventilation may still be necessary during initial resuscitation.

===Bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation devices===

Resistance to bag valve mask may suggest presence of a foreign body that is obstructing airways and commonly used as a diagnostic tool and treatment for respiratory arrest. The bag-valve-mask device has a self-inflating bag with a soft mask that rests on the face. When the bag is connected to an oxygen supply, the patient will receive 60 to 100% of inspired oxygen. The purpose of bag-valve-mask is to provide adequate temporary ventilation and allow the body to achieve airway control by itself. However, if the bag-valve-mask is left on for more than five minutes, air may be introduced into the stomach. At that point, a nasogastric tube should be inserted to take the accumulated air out. During this process, practitioners must carefully position and maneuver the bag-valve-mask in order to keep airways open. To ensure an adequate seal when using the bag valve mask to ventilate, specific hand positioning is typically used. The provider places his or her thumb and index finger in a &#x27;C&#x27; shape on top of the mask and grips the jaw under the mask with the other three fingers, creating an &#x27;E&#x27; shape. The thumb and index finger provide downward pressure on the mask while the remaining fingers maintain head tilt and jaw thrust. The free hand can then be used to provide ventilation via the bag. For children, pediatric bags can be used. Pediatric bags have a valve that limits peak airway pressures to around 35–40 cm of water. Practitioners must tweak valve settings to accurately determine each of their patients to avoid hypoventilation or hyperventilation. When applying ventilation with the bag valve mask, the provider should apply just enough pressure to bag to see a chest rise. Providing excessive bag pressure can actually impair the blood flow to the heart and brain, so during CPR extra caution should be taken to limit size of tidal volume. The rate of manual ventilation should not exceed 12 times per minute, or one ventilation every 5 seconds as to avoid hyperventilation.

=== Airway patency devices ===
An oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway is used during bag-valve-mask ventilation to prevent soft tissues from blocking the airway. An oropharyngeal airway may cause gagging and vomiting. Therefore, an oropharyngeal airway must be sized appropriately. An airway that is incorrectly sized can worsen the airway obstruction. The distance measured should be from the corner of the patient&#x27;s mouth to the angle of the jaw or earlobe.

===Laryngeal mask airways===

The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is a tube with an inflatable cuff. A laryngeal mask airway can be positioned in the lower oropharynx to prevent airway obstruction by soft tissues and to create a safe channel for ventilation. The laryngeal mask airway is the standard rescue ventilation when endotracheal intubation cannot be accomplished. To insert the laryngeal mask airway into the patient, the deflated mask should be pressed against the hard palate, rotated past the base of the tongue, and reaching the pharynx. Once the mask has been placed in the correct position, the mask can be inflated. Some benefits of the laryngeal mask airway include minimization of gastric inflation and protection against regurgitation. A potential problem the laryngeal mask airway poses is that over inflation will make the mask more rigid and less able to adapt to the patient&#x27;s anatomy, compressing the tongue and causing tongue edema. In that case, the mask pressure should be lowered or a larger mask size should be used. If non-comatose patients are given muscle relaxants before the insertion of the laryngeal mask airway, they may gag and aspirate when the drugs are worn off. At that point, the laryngeal mask airway should be removed immediately to eliminate the gag response and buy time to start at new alternative intubation technique.

===Endotracheal intubation===

A tracheal tube is inserted into the trachea through the mouth or nose. Endotracheal tubes contain high-volume, low-pressure balloon cuffs to minimize air leakage and the risk of aspiration. Cuffed tubes were made originally for adults and children over 8 years old, but cuffed tubes have been used in infants and younger children to prevent air leakage. Cuffed tubes can be inflated to the extent needed to prevent air leakage. The endotracheal tube is a guaranteed mechanism to secure a compromised airway, limit aspiration, and bring about mechanical ventilation in comatose patients. The endotracheal tube is a great method for patients who are comatose, have an obstructed airway, or need mechanical ventilation. The endotracheal tube also allows suctioning of the lower respiratory tract. Drugs that can be inserted through the endotracheal tube during cardiac arrest are discouraged. Before intubation, patients need correct patient positioning and ventilation with 100% oxygen. The purpose of ventilation with 100% oxygen is to denitrogenate healthy patients and prolong the safe apneic time. Tubes with an internal diameter of over 8mm are acceptable for most adults. Insertion technique includes visualizing the epiglottis, the posterior laryngeal structure, and not passing the tube unless tracheal insertion is ensured.

===Surgical airway===

Surgical entry is required when the upper airway is obstructed by a foreign body, massive trauma has occurred, or if ventilation cannot be accomplished by any of the aforementioned methods. The requirement of the surgical airway is commonly known as the response to failed intubation. In comparison, surgical airways require 100 seconds to complete from incision to ventilation compared to laryngeal mask airways and other devices. During emergency cricothyrotomy, the patient lies on his back with neck extended and shoulders backward. The larynx is held in one hand by the practitioner while the other hand is holding a blade to incise the skin through the subcutaneous tissue and into the midline of the cricothyroid membrane to access the trachea. A hollow tube is used inserted into the trachea to keep the airway open. A tracheal hook is used to keep the space open and prevent retraction. Complications may include hemorrhage, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, and pneumothorax. Cricothyrotomy is used as emergency surgical access due to being fast and simple. Another surgical airway method is called tracheostomy. Tracheostomy is done in the operating room by a surgeon. This is the preferred method for patients requiring long-term ventilation. Tracheostomy uses skin puncture and dilators to insert the tracheostomy tube.

===Drugs to aid intubation===

Patients with respiratory arrest can be intubated without drugs. However, patients can be given sedating and paralytic drugs to minimize discomfort and help out with intubation. Pretreatment includes 100% oxygen, lidocaine, and atropine. 100% oxygen should be administered for 3 to 5 minutes. The time depends on pulse rate, pulmonary function, RBC count, and other metabolic factors. Lidocaine can be given in 1.5 mg/kg IV a few minutes before sedation and paralysis. The purpose of administering lidocaine is to blunt the sympathetic response of an increased heart rate, blood pressure, and intracranial pressure caused by laryngoscopy. Atropine can be given when children produce a vagal response, evidenced by bradycardia, in response to intubation. Some physicians even give out vecuronium, which is a neuromuscular blocker to prevent muscle fasciculations in patients over 4 years old. Fasciculations may result in muscle pain on awakening. Laryngoscopy and intubation are uncomfortable procedures, so etomidate may be delivered. Etomidate is a short-acting IV drug with sedative analgesic properties. The drug works well and does not cause cardiovascular depression. Ketamine is an anesthetic that may be used as well, but it may cause hallucinations or bizarre behavior upon awakening. Thiopental and methohexital may be used as well to provide sedation, but they tend to cause hypotension.

===Volume-cycled ventilation===

The purpose of mechanical ventilators is to deliver a constant volume, constant pressure, or a combination of both with each breath. Any given volume will correspond to a specific pressure on the pressure-volume curve and vice versa in any case. Settings on each mechanical ventilator may include respiratory rate, tidal volume, trigger sensitivity, flow rate, waveform, and inspiratory/expiratory ratio. The volume-cycled ventilation includes the volume-control function and delivers a set tidal volume. The pressure is not a fixed number but it varies with resistance and capacitance of the respiratory system. The volume-cycled ventilation is the simplest and most efficient of providing ventilation to a patient&#x27;s airway compared to other methods of mechanical ventilation. Each inspiratory effort that is beyond the set sensitivity threshold will be accounted for and fixed to the delivery of the corresponding tidal volume. If the patient does not breathe enough, then the volume-cycled ventilation will initiate a breath for the patient to bring up the breathing rate to the minimum respiratory rate. The synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) is a similar method of mechanical ventilation that also delivers breaths at a fixed rate and volume that corresponds to the patient&#x27;s breathing. Unlike the Volume-Cycled Ventilation, patient efforts above the fixed rate are unassisted in the synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV).

===Pressure-cycled ventilation===

The pressure-cycled ventilation includes pressure control ventilation and pressure support ventilation. Both methods offer a set inspiratory pressure. The tidal volume varies depending on the resistance and elastance of the respiratory system. Pressure-cycled ventilation can help alleviate symptoms in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome by limiting the distending pressure of the lungs. The pressure control ventilation is specifically a pressure-cycled form of assist-control ventilators. Assist-control ventilators describe a mode of ventilation that maintains a minimum respiratory rate regardless of whether or not the patient initiates a spontaneous breath. Each inspiratory effort that is beyond the sensitivity threshold delivers full pressures support for a fixed inspiratory time. There is maintenance of a minimum respiratory rate. In the pressure support ventilation, the minimum rate is not set. Instead, all breaths are triggered by the patient. The way that the pressure support ventilation works is by assisting the patient with a constant pressure until the patient&#x27;s inspiratory flow falls below a threshold. The longer, deeper inspiratory flows by the patient will result in a larger tidal volume. This method of mechanical ventilation will help patients assume more work of breathing.

===Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)===
Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is the delivery of positive pressure ventilation through a tight-fitting mask that covers the nose and mouth. It assists patients who can spontaneously breathe. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation delivers end-expiratory pressure with a volume control setting. There are two ways that noninvasive positive pressure ventilation can be delivered: continuous positive airway pressure or bilevel positive airway pressure. In continuous positive airway pressure, constant pressure is maintained throughout cycles of respiration with no additional inspiratory support. In bilevel positive airway pressure, both expiratory positive airway pressure and inspiratory positive airway pressure are set by the physician. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation should not be administered to people who are hemodynamically unstable, gastric emptying impaired, bowel obstructed or pregnant. In these circumstances, swallowing large amounts of air will result in vomiting and possibly death. If frequent arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia and shock arrhythmias occur, practitioners should change delivery to endotracheal intubation or conventional mechanical ventilation. People who should not use noninvasive positive pressure ventilation include obtunded patients or ones with secretions. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation can be used in an outpatient setting for patients with obstructive sleep apnea.

<text>Daniel Richard Crissinger (December 10, 1860 – July 12, 1942) was an American banker and lawyer who served as the 3rd chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1923 to 1927. Crissinger previously served as the 14th comptroller of the Currency from 1921 to 1923.

==Early life==
Crissinger was born on December 10, 1860, to John M. Crissinger a leading lumberjack tradesman and Margaret (Ganzhorn) Crissinger a German immigrant in Tully Township, Marion County, Ohio. He was named after his grand-uncle Daniel Crissinger and was an only child after his brother died at infancy. Crissinger was educated in Caledonia, Ohio, and graduated from Caledonia High School in 1880. He spent one year as a grade school teacher and he worked for one year in the high school.

He attended Buchtel College in Akron, Ohio, and graduated 1885. He studied law with Judge William Z. Davis in Marion, Ohio, until he began formal study at the University of Cincinnati. After graduation in June 1886, he became a partner of Judge Davis.

== Career ==
In 1893 Crissinger was elected city solicitor of Marion, Ohio. He served in several partnerships and was nominated for Congress in 1904 and 1906 as a Democrat. Crissinger was vice-president of City National Bank of Marion, Ohio at the time of its founding and he became president of the bank in 1911. He held other posts including director of Marion Steam Shovel Company, president of National City Bank &amp; Trust Company, director and vice-president of the Marion Union Stock Yards Company director, a director and treasurer of the Marion Packing Company, a director of the Marion County Telephone Company, and president of the Marion Cemetery Association.

Crissinger was nominated in 1921 by Republican President Warren G. Harding, who was a friend and neighbor in Ohio, to serve as the 14th Comptroller of the Currency. He became the 3rd Chairman of the Federal Reserve in 1923 and he served under presidents Harding and Coolidge.

== Death ==
He died on July 12, 1942.

<text>Castel Gandolfo (, , ; ), colloquially known as Castello in the &quot;Castelli Romani&quot; dialects, is a town located southeast of Rome, in the Italian region of Lazio. Situated on a hilltop in the Alban Hills with panoramic views of Lake Albano, Castel Gandolfo is home to approximately 8,900 residents and is renowned as one of Italy&#x27;s most scenic towns. It is one of I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;).

Within the town&#x27;s boundaries lies the Apostolic Palace of Castel Gandolfo, which served as a summer residence and vacation retreat for the pope, the leader of the Catholic Church. Although the palace is located within the borders of Castel Gandolfo, it holds extraterritorial status as one of the properties of the Holy See and is not under Italian jurisdiction. It has been transformed into a museum and is now open to the public.

It is included and protected by the Regional Park of Castelli Romani, formed in 1984. Most of the soil is of volcanic origin, with prevalence of materials such as tuff and pozzolana. Its seismic classification is rated a Zone 2 (medium-high seismicity) 

==== Hydrography ====

The main water body is Lake Albano, often called Lake Castel Gandolfo. The Metropolitan City of Rome currently manages the lake.

Climate classification: Zone D, 1966 GR / G.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Castel Gandolfo&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;Castrum Gandulphi&quot;, the name of the castle on this site was presumably owned by the family of Gandolfi, originally from Genoa. Another hypothesis, supported by Pope Pius II in his commentary (1462), is that the name results from Gandulphi Sabinorum, from a certain Gandolfo Savelli.

== History ==

Archaeological finds from the 16th century BC come from the area of what is now Castel Gandolfo.

The site of the modern town is a candidate for the site of legendary ancient Alba Longa, capital of the Latin League. It was later developed by emperor Domitian into his vast palace.

Its name is derived from a fortification of the ducal Gandolfi family (of Genoese origin, named after St. Gondolfus) in the 12th century, which passed to the Savelli family from whom the Apostolic Camera purchased it in 1596 for 150,000 scudi. Pope Clement VIII was the first pope to come to Castel Gandolfo, but the rebuilding of the old castle was the project of Urban VIII who first came in 1626.

During the Napoleonic Wars, some 900 anti-French citizens of neighboring Velletri held out in Castel Gandolfo, resisting the siege by Joachim Murat.

During World War II, Pope Pius XII opened up the grounds of Castel Gandolfo to refugees escaping the fighting taking place around Rome. On January 22, 1944, the first of what became 12,000 people began arriving on the property, often bringing with them their cows, horses, mules and sheep. Included were many Roman Jews, and other non-Catholics. During the time they lived there, 36 children were born, almost all of whom were named for the Pope who gave them safe harbor. The pope&#x27;s private apartment was turned into a nursery.

The place was urbanized during the 20th century, thanks to the opening of the railway Roma-Velletri, and today is divided between the municipalities of Castel Gandolfo, Albano Laziale and Rome. The part castle, known as Pavona Pond due to the above-named for Round Pond, has about 3,000 inhabitants and has as its patron saint St. Eugene III of Toledo.

Mole di Castel Gandolfo, divided in part by the town of Albano Laziale, owes their name to the presence in the place of ancient mass fed by the waters of the Emissary of Lake Albano, which were used until the 19th century by the inhabitants of Castel Gandolfo and Albano Laziale to crush the grain.

<text>John Gwynn (1713 – 28 February 1786) was an English architect and civil engineer, who became one of the founder members of the Royal Academy in 1768. He advocated greater control over planning in London, for which he produced detailed suggestions. His buildings include Magdalen Bridge and the Covered Market in Oxford, and several bridges over the River Severn.

==Life==
Gwynn was born and died in Shrewsbury, Shropshire. He worked initially as a carpenter, but then decided to practice as a (largely self-taught) architect and town planner, moving to London, where he became a friend of Samuel Johnson.

In 1749, when Sir Christopher Wren&#x27;s drawings were sold, Gwynn obtained Wren&#x27;s plan for the rebuilding of the City of London, and published it, adding some comments of his own. Seventeen years later, in 1766, he published &quot;London and Westminster Improved&quot;, It was passed in June of the same year. in which he criticised the loose control over building in the West End, saying that &quot;the finest part of town is left to ignorant and capricious persons&quot;, and called for development to be controlled by a general plan. He made more than a hundred suggestions for improvements to the capital. They included the rebuilding of London Bridge; the construction of a &quot;St, George&#x27;s Bridge&quot; in the position where Waterloo Bridge was eventually built; a &quot;King&#x27;s Square&quot; on the site of the Royal Mews (later occupied by Trafalgar Square); a royal palace in Hyde Park; a street following a route close to that of Nash&#x27;s later Regent Street and quays along both sides of the Thames. The &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; noted in 1826 that No part of his ingenious design, however, was adopted: the publication does not appear to have produced any public interest at the time; and Mr. Gwynn has been so little thought of since that his designs lately brought forward as original conceptions. However proposals similar to many of Gwynn&#x27;s were eventually implemented; in the twentieth century, John Summerson wrote that &quot;the amazing thing about this plan is its complete grip on reality&quot;, his only impractical belief being that the growth of London could be stopped at Hyde Park in the west and at the Marylebone Road in the north.
Gwynn influenced the drafting of the Building Act 1774 which improved standards of materials and workmanship – Bedford Square was one of the first areas of London to benefit.

In 1759, he unsuccessfully submitted a design to the competition for the new Blackfriars Bridge. Samuel Johnson lobbied on his behalf, sending three letters in his support to the &quot;Daily Gazetteer&quot;, but plans by Robert Mylne were preferred. He was particularly associated with projects in Oxford, including Magdalen Bridge (1772–90), the city&#x27;s workhouse (1772–73) and the Covered Market (1774), and with bridges across the River Severn including the &quot;English Bridge&quot;, in his native Shrewsbury (1769), and others at Atcham (1769–71), Llandrinio (1769-1775) and Worcester (1781)

He was one of the foundation members of the Royal Academy in 1768, Samuel Wale, the academy&#x27;s first professor of perspective had at one time been his assistant.

An anonymous publication of 1742 entitled &quot;The Art of Architecture: A Poem In Imitation of Horace&#x27;s Art of Poetry&quot; has been generally attributed to Gwynn.
He died in Shrewsbury in 1786.

<text>Alfredo Félix Cristiani Burkard (born 22 November 1947) is a Salvadoran politician who was President of El Salvador from 1989 to 1994.

==Life and career==
Born into a wealthy family in San Salvador, his father Felix Cristiani was an Italian immigrant from Bagnaria, Italy and his mother Margoth Burkard de Cristiani was Salvadoran of Swiss descent. He was educated at the &#x27;Escuela Americana&#x27; (American School) in San Salvador and Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where he graduated with a degree in Business Administration. He returned to El Salvador to work for the family business, which included pharmaceuticals, coffee, cotton and until July 2008 the &quot;Semillas Cristiani Burkard&quot; (SCB) the Central American Monsanto Company representative, leading corn seed company focused on hybrid corn production.

He married Margarita Llach in 1970, and has three children and nine grandchildren.

==Political career==
He remained generally outside politics until the beginning of the 1980s when the armed conflict in El Salvador reached a critical point. As insurrection became more widespread, he became involved with the Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA), which had been founded by School of the Americas trained military intelligence officer Roberto D&#x27;Aubuisson. In March 1985 D&#x27;Aubuisson resigned after ARENA suffered a defeat in the presidential elections. Cristiani became leader of the party in 1988.

In the local and congressional elections of March 1988, ARENA won 80% of the local votes and 31 of the 60 seats in the Congress; Cristiani won one of the seats.

===President of El Salvador===
In the 1989 presidential election, Cristiani was elected President with 53.8% of the vote. His swearing-in marked the beginning of a 20-year period of ARENA presidencies, and also marked only the second time in El Salvador&#x27;s history that the ruling party peacefully surrendered power to the opposition.

====Foreign policy====
After becoming President of El Salvador, he, with members of his cabinet, and other colleagues visited Europe and London. He was the principal guest at a dinner held in his honour by the Western Goals Institute at Simpsons-in-the-Strand, London, on 25 September 1989. The guest list included figures such as Sir Alfred Sherman (policy advisor to Margaret Thatcher), Professor Antony Flew, Zigmunt Szkopiak, Denis Walker and Dr Harvey Ward, all of whom were active anti-communists. This visit, along with others that included Spain, Italy, United States, Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and all Central American countries, was part of a diplomatic effort carried out by Cristiani and his delegates in order to find and secure international support for the peace negotiation efforts that were being carried out by his government. Support was actively and officially sanctioned by Venezuela, Mexico, and Spain, who would play an active role, along with the United Nations, in the negotiating process.

====Domestic policy====
He was successful in the peace negotiations with the FMLN. The Salvadoran Civil War finally ended on 16 January 1992 with the Chapultepec Peace Accords.

During his term as president, his Minister of the Presidency, the 73-year-old Dr. Jose Antonio Rodriguez Porth, was assassinated. This brought disapproval by the international community against human rights. His murder has been attributed to an urban commando of the FMLN.

====Economic policy====
He is also known for having started structural adjustment programs, following a strong neoliberal approach. He initiated the privatization of Salvadoran banks. His wife&#x27;s family bought a considerable amount of stock of one of El Salvador&#x27;s largest banks, Banco Cuscatlán, which was later bought by Citi Bank. He also is responsible for the privatization of Hotel Presidente. His government also supported a unilateral reduction of Salvadoran trade barriers, the introduction of the Value Added Tax, and the elimination of other direct taxes. Despite the fact that the tax revenues were reduced, government expenditures remained high.

==Retirement and return==
He retired from politics in 1994 when his presidential term ended, and returned as president of the ARENA party in 2009 after the first presidential defeat of ARENA in twenty years.

== Accusations ==
In 2008, two human rights organizations, The Center for Justice and Accountability and The Spanish Association for Human Rights, filed lawsuit in a Spanish court charging Cristiani and fourteen members of the Salvadoran military with direct responsibility for the 1989 murders of Jesuits in El Salvador. Judge Eloy Velasco admitted this lawsuit in 2009, on the basis of the principle of universal justice.

According to former rector José María Tojeira, the Jesuits and Universidad Centroamericana José Simeón Cañas, had nothing to do with this lawsuit.

During the course of the judicial process, recognized Salvadoran personalities travelled to Spain to intercede for president Cristiani and remove him from the list of the accused. One of the members of the delegations was Salvador Samayoa, a former member of FPL (the Marxist–Leninist Popular Liberation Front) and the high command of the FMLN. Another of the members of the delegation was the Salvadoran politician Oscar Santamaría. Both were part of the negotiating commissions of the FMLN and the Salvadoran government that put an end to the Salvadoran Civil War. According to a cable from the US Embassy in El Salvador, both politicians were worried about the implications that the case could have in El Salvador. However, their efforts focused on Cristiani&#x27;s situation Samayoa was once Ignacio Ellacuría&#x27;s assistant and close collaborator. Ellacuría was one of the slain scholars during the massacre in which Cristiani was implicated. Ellacuria was allegedly also the main target of the operation. Despite the efforts, an unknown witness in the case confessed his participation in this massacre, implicating the High Command of the Salvadoran Military as well as former Cristiani. Judge Velasco&#x27;s resolution on the demand, initially included investigations on the 14 implicated members of the Salvadoran Military, excluding the former Salvadoran president, but including the Military High Command, represented by General (then Colonel,) René Emilio Ponce (then the chief of defence of El Salvador). However, the new testimony opened up for the indictment of Cristiani as well. Some of the most compelling evidence that has been available for journalists is notes taken by hand during a meeting of the Salvadoran military High Command. The massacre was allegedly planned during the meeting, and both the High Command and the country&#x27;s executive, were probably aware, if not directly involved, of the planning meetings. Declassified documents by the CIA have recently shed new light on this case. They indicate that the CIA had for many years known of the Salvadoran government&#x27;s plans to murder the Jesuits. The court found 20 members of the Salvadoran military guilty on the counts of murder, terrorism, and crimes against humanity. Together, the 20 Salvadorans could serve up to 270 years in a Spanish prison. However, the court did not have enough evidence to convict Cristiani for encouraging the crime. The court established that the military executed the Jesuits because they were strong advocates of a peaceful solution to the civil war. Ellacuria was considered an obstacle to the military victory over FMLN because of his strong influence for peace negotiations.

In October 2021, his name was mentioned in the Pandora Papers. He had created at least 16 offshore companies in the year following his departure from power.

In June 2023, Cristiani&#x27;s properties were raided and seized by the office of the attorney general as a part of a &quot;war on corruption&quot;.

== Youth Penal Code ==
The National Assembly proposed a penal code specific for the youth, and it was approved during President Cristiani&#x27;s term. His minister of justice was Rene Hernandez. The law came into effect on 6 May 1995 and protects children from being tried as adults. Crimes committed by young minors are not longer judged under the regular Penal Code but under the Youth Penal Code, which applies to minors between the ages of 12 and 16 years. The maximum term for a minor who commits a crime was originally only 5 years, but it has recently been changed to 7 years.

<doc id="740633" wikidata="Q183059" url="?curid=740633" title="Thomas Theodore Crittenden">
<text>Thomas Theodore Crittenden (January 1, 1832 – May 29, 1909) was an American politician and military officer who served as the 24th Governor of Missouri from 1881 to 1885. He was a Union Army colonel during the American Civil War.

==Early life and education==
Crittenden was born in 1832 in Shelbyville, Kentucky, to Henry and Anna Maria Crittenden. He was born into a political family and was the nephew of Kentucky Governor John J. Crittenden. He was educated at Centre College and also studied law with his uncle.

==Marriage and family==
In 1856, Crittenden married Caroline Wheeler &quot;Carrie&quot; Jackson (August 1, 1839 – January 27, 1917) and had several children. His son Thomas T. Crittenden Jr. was later a mayor of Kansas City, and his son Henry Huston Crittenden (1859–1943) was compiler of &quot;The Crittenden Memoirs&quot; (1936).

==Career==
Shortly following Crittenden&#x27;s marriage, the family moved to Lexington, Missouri, where he started a law practice. During the American Civil War Crittenden was appointed a Colonel in the 7th Missouri State Militia Cavalry, fighting on the Union side. Governor Willard Preble Hall appointed Crittenden to the post of Missouri Attorney General in 1864.

Following his term, Crittenden moved his law practice to Warrensburg, Missouri, in partnership with Francis Cockrell. Crittenden was elected to the United States House of Representatives for the 7th congressional district in 1872 and again in 1876. In 1880, he helped to found the Missouri Bar Association.

Crittenden was elected Governor of Missouri in the 1880 election. As governor, Crittenden wanted to suppress the robberies and violence committed by the James Gang. He authorized a reward of $5,000 (which was paid for by railroad corporations) for the capture of Jesse James and also for his brother Frank, which resulted in Robert Ford killing Jesse in 1882. Following Ford&#x27;s conviction for the murder, Crittenden pardoned him. On October 5, 1882, Frank James surrendered in Jefferson City.

During his term, Crittenden&#x27;s administration also collected payment on loans to the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad, reduced state debt, established the Missouri State Board of Health and the Missouri State Bureau of Mines and Mine inspection, increased appropriations for education, and started a training school for nurses in St. Louis.

Following his gubernatorial term, Crittenden moved to Kansas City, Missouri and practiced law. From 1893 to 1897, he was the United States consul general in Mexico City, appointed by President Grover Cleveland. Crittenden died in 1909 in Kansas City, Missouri. He was buried there at the Forest Hill Calvary Cemetery in Kansas City.

==Popular media==
In the 2007 movie &quot;The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford&quot;, Crittenden is portrayed by James Carville.

<text>Benedetto Croce, (; ; 25 February 1866 – 20 November 1952)
was an Italian idealist philosopher, historian, and politician who wrote on numerous topics, including philosophy, history, historiography, and aesthetics. A political liberal in most regards, he formulated a distinction between liberalism (as support for civil liberties) and &quot;liberism&quot; (as support for &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economics and capitalism). Croce had considerable influence on other Italian intellectuals, from Marxists to Italian fascists, such as Antonio Gramsci and Giovanni Gentile, respectively. 

He had a long career in the Italian Parliament, joining the Senate of the Kingdom of Italy in 1910, serving through Fascism and the Second World War before being elected to the Constituent Assembly as a Liberal. In the 1948 general election he was elected to the new republican Senate and served there until his death. He was a longtime member of the Italian Liberal Party, serving as its president from 1944 to 1947.

Croce was the president of the worldwide writers&#x27; association PEN International from 1949 until 1952. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature 16 times.
He is also noted for his &quot;major contributions to the rebirth of Italian democracy&quot;. He was an elected International Member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

==Biography==
Croce was born in Pescasseroli in the Abruzzo region of Italy. His family was influential and wealthy, and he was raised in a very strict Catholic environment. Around the age of 16, he quit Catholicism and developed a personal philosophy of spiritual life, in which religion cannot be anything but a historical institution where the creative strength of mankind can be expressed. He kept this philosophy for the rest of his life.

In 1883, an earthquake occurred in the village of Casamicciola on the island of Ischia near Naples, where he was on holiday with his family, destroying the home they lived in. His mother, father, and only sister were all killed, and he was buried for a long time and barely survived. After the earthquake, he inherited his family&#x27;s fortune and—much like Schopenhauer—was able to live the rest of his life in relative leisure, devoting a great deal of time to philosophy as an independent intellectual writing from his palazzo in Naples (Ryn, 2000:xi).

He studied law, but never graduated, at the University of Naples, while reading extensively on historical materialism. His ideas were publicized at the University of Rome towards the end of the 1890s by Professor Antonio Labriola. Croce was well acquainted with and sympathetic to the developments in European socialist philosophy exemplified by August Bebel, Friedrich Engels, Karl Kautsky, Paul Lafargue, Wilhelm Liebknecht, and Filippo Turati.

Influenced by Neapolitan-born Gianbattista Vico&#x27;s thoughts about art and history, he began studying philosophy in 1893. Croce also purchased the house in which Vico had lived. His friend, the philosopher Giovanni Gentile, encouraged him to read Hegel. Croce&#x27;s famous commentary on Hegel, &quot;What is Living and What is Dead of the Philosophy of Hegel&quot;, was published in 1907.

=== Political involvement ===
As his fame increased, Croce was persuaded, against his initial wishes, to become involved in politics. In 1910, he was appointed to the Italian Senate, a lifelong position (Ryn, 2000:xi). He was an open critic of Italy&#x27;s participation in World War I, feeling that it was a suicidal trade war. Although this made him initially unpopular, his reputation was restored after the war. In 1919, he supported the government of Francesco Saverio Nitti while also expressing his admiration for the nascent Weimar Republic and the Social Democratic Party of Germany. He was Minister of Public Education between 1920 and 1921 for the 5th and last government headed by Giovanni Giolitti. Benito Mussolini assumed power slightly more than a year after Croce&#x27;s exit from the government; Mussolini&#x27;s first Minister of Public Education was Giovanni Gentile, an independent who later became a fascist and with whom Croce had earlier cooperated in a philosophical polemic against positivism. Gentile remained minister for only a year but managed to begin a comprehensive reform of Italian education that was based partly on Croce&#x27;s earlier suggestions. Gentile&#x27;s reform remained in force well beyond the Fascist regime and was only partly abolished in 1962.

Croce was instrumental in the relocation of the Biblioteca Nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III to the Royal Palace of Naples in 1923.

=== Relations with Italian fascism ===
Croce initially supported Mussolini&#x27;s Italian fascism government that took power in 1922. The assassination by the National Fascist Party and Blackshirts of the socialist politician Giacomo Matteotti in June 1924 shook Croce&#x27;s support for Mussolini. In May 1925, Croce was one of the signatories to the Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals which had been written by Croce himself; however, in June 1924, he had voted in the Senate in support of the Mussolini government. He later explained that he had hoped that the support for Mussolini in parliament would weaken the more extreme Fascists who, he believed, were responsible for Matteotti&#x27;s murder. Croce later became one of the firmest opponents of fascism.

In 1928, Croce voted against the law which effectively abolished free elections in Italy by requiring electors to vote for a list of candidates approved by the Grand Council of Fascism. He became increasingly dismayed by the number of ex-democrats who had abandoned their former principles. Croce frequently provided financial assistance to anti-fascist writers and dissidents, such as Giorgio Amendola, Ivanoe Bonomi, and Meuccio Ruini, as well as those who wanted to maintain intellectual and political independence from the regime, and covertly helped them get published. Croce&#x27;s house in Turin became a popular destination for anti-fascists. After the war, Amendola, along with communists like Eugenio Reale reflected that Croce offered aid and encouragement to both liberal and Marxist resistance members during the crucial years.

Croce was seriously threatened by Mussolini&#x27;s regime, and suffered the only act of physical violence at the hands of the fascists in November 1926, when fascists ransacked his home and library in Naples. Although he managed to stay outside prison thanks to his reputation, he remained subject to surveillance, and his academic work was kept in obscurity by the government, to the extent that no mainstream newspaper or academic publication ever referred to him. Croce later coined the term &quot;onagrocrazia&quot; (literally &quot;government by asses&quot;) to emphasize the anti-intellectual and boorish tendencies of parts of the Fascist regime. However, in describing Fascism as anti-intellectual Croce ignored the many Italian intellectuals who at the time actively supported Mussolini&#x27;s regime, including Croce&#x27;s former friend and colleague, Gentile. Croce also described Fascism as &quot;malattia morale&quot; (literally &quot;moral illness&quot;). When Mussolini&#x27;s government adopted antisemitic policies in 1938, Croce was the only non-Jewish intellectual who refused to complete a government questionnaire designed to collect information on the so-called &quot;racial background&quot; of Italian intellectuals. Besides writing in his periodical, Croce used other means to express his anti-racism and to make public statements against the persecution of the Jews.

=== Brief government stints and constitutional referendum ===
In 1944, when democracy was restored in Southern Italy, Croce, as an &quot;icon of liberal anti-fascism&quot;, became minister without portfolio in governments headed by Pietro Badoglio for about a month and again for a month by Ivanoe Bonomi (Ryn, 2000:xi–xii) He left the government in July 1944 but remained president of the Liberal Party until 1947 (Ryn, 2000:xii).

Croce voted for the Monarchy in the 1946 Italian constitutional referendum, after having persuaded his Liberal Party to adopt a neutral stance. He was elected to the Constituent Assembly which existed in Italy between June 1946 and January 1948. He spoke in the Assembly against the Peace treaty (signed in February 1947), which he regarded as humiliating for Italy. He declined to stand as provisional President of Italy.

=== Philosophical works ===
Croce&#x27;s most interesting philosophical ideas are expounded in three works: &quot;Aesthetic&quot; (1902), &quot;Logic&quot; (1908), and &quot;Philosophy of the Practical&quot; (1908), but his complete work is spread over 80 books and 40 years worth of publications in his own bi-monthly literary magazine, &quot;La Critica&quot; (Ryn, 2000:xi) Croce was philosophically a pantheist, but, from a religious point of view, an agnostic; however, he published an essay entitled &quot;Why We Cannot Help Calling Ourselves Christians&quot;. This essay shows the Christian roots of European culture, but religion is considered by Croce a mere propaedeutic study for philosophy, which is the only true science: philosophy is, in fact, the science of spirit (the &quot;Philosophy of Spirit&quot;).

==Philosophy of spirit==

Heavily influenced by Hegel and other German Idealists such as Schelling, Croce produced what was called, by him, the Philosophy of Spirit. His preferred designations were &quot;absolute idealism&quot; or &quot;absolute historicism&quot;. Croce&#x27;s work can be seen as a second attempt (contra Kant) to resolve the problems and conflicts between empiricism and rationalism (or sensationalism and transcendentalism, respectively). He calls his way &quot;immanentism&quot;, and concentrates on the lived human experience, as it happens in specific places and times. Since the root of reality is this immanent existence in concrete experience, Croce places aesthetics at the foundation of his philosophy.

===Domains of mind===
Croce&#x27;s methodological approach to philosophy is expressed in his divisions of the spirit, or mind. He divides mental activity first into the theoretical, and then the practical. The theoretical division splits between aesthetics and logic. This theoretical aesthetic includes most importantly: intuitions and history. The logical includes concepts and relations. Practical spirit is concerned with economics and ethics. Economics is here to be understood as an exhaustive term for all utilitarian matters.

Each of these divisions has an underlying structure that colours, or dictates, the sort of thinking that goes on within them. While aesthetics are driven by beauty, logic is subject to truth, economics is concerned with what is useful, and the moral, or ethics, is bound to the good. This schema is descriptive in that it attempts to elucidate the logic of human thought; however, it is prescriptive as well, in that these ideas form the basis for epistemological claims and confidence.

==History==
Croce also had great esteem for Vico and shared his opinion that history should be written by philosophers. Croce&#x27;s &quot;On History&quot; sets forth the view of history as &quot;philosophy in motion&quot;, that there is no &quot;cosmic design&quot; or ultimate plan in history, and that the &quot;science of history&quot; was a farce.

==Aesthetics==
Croce&#x27;s work &quot;Breviario di estetica&quot; (&quot;The Essence of Aesthetics&quot;) appears in the form of four lessons (&quot;quattro lezioni&quot;) in aesthetics that he was asked to write and deliver at the inauguration of Rice University in 1912. He declined an invitation to attend the event, but he wrote the lessons and submitted them for translation so that they could be read in his absence.

In this brief, but dense, work, Croce sets forth his theory of art. He believed that art is more important than science or metaphysics since only art edifies us. He claimed that all we know can be reduced to imaginative knowledge. Art springs from the latter, making it at its heart, pure imagery. All thought is based in part on this, and it precedes all other thought. The task of an artist is then to invent the perfect image that they can produce for their viewer since this is what beauty fundamentally is – the formation of inward, mental images in their ideal state. Our intuition is the basis for forming these concepts within us.

Croce was the first to develop a position later known as aesthetic expressivism, the idea that art expresses emotions, not ideas. (R. G. Collingwood later developed a similar thesis.)

Croce&#x27;s theory was later debated by such contemporary Italian philosophers as Umberto Eco, who locates the aesthetic within a semiotic construction.

==Contributions to liberal political theory==

Croce&#x27;s liberalism differs from the theories advocated by most proponents of liberal political thought, including those in Britain and the United States. While Croce theorises that the individual is the basis of society, he rejects social atomism. While Croce accepts limited government, he disputes the idea that the government should have fixed legitimate powers. Croce did not agree with John Locke about the nature of liberty. Croce believed that liberty is not a natural right but an earned right that arises out of the continuing historical struggle for its maintenance. Croce defined civilization as the &quot;continual vigilance&quot; against barbarism, and liberty conformed to his ideal for civilization as it allows one to experience the full potential of life. Croce also rejects egalitarianism as absurd. In short, his variety of liberalism is aristocratic, as he views society as being led by the few who can create the goodness of truth, civilization, and beauty, with the great mass of citizens, simply benefiting from them but unable to fully comprehend their creations (Ryn, 2000:xii).

In &quot;Etica e politica&quot; (1931), Croce defines liberalism as an ethical conception of life that rejects dogmatism and favours diversity, and in the name of liberty and free choice of the individual, is hostile to the authoritarianism of fascism, communism, and the Catholic Church. While Croce realizes that democracy can sometimes threaten individual liberty, he sees liberalism and democracy as predicated on the same ideals of moral equality and opposition to authority. Furthermore, he acknowledged the positive historical role played by the Socialist parties in Italy in their struggles to improve conditions for the working class, and urged modern socialists to swear off dictatorial solutions. In contrast to the socialists, who Croce viewed as part of modernity along with liberals, his condemnation of reactionaries is unremittingly harsh.

Croce draws a distinction between liberalism and capitalism or &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economic doctrines. For Croce, capitalism only emerged to meet certain economic needs of society, and could be changed or even replaced if better solutions to those needs were found, if it failed to promote freedom, or if economic values clashed with higher values. Thus liberalism could welcome socialistic proposals so long as they promoted freedom. Croce&#x27;s ideas on the separation between liberalism as an ethical principle and the contingent &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economic doctrines which accompanied it in certain contexts would influence Italian social democrats such as Leo Valiani and Giuseppe Saragat as well as the liberal socialist synthesis of Carlo Rosselli.

<text>Effie Crockett (4 March 1856 – January 7, 1940), also known as Effie I. Canning, also known as Effie C. Carlton, was an American actress. She is credited with having written and composed the lullaby &quot;Rock-a-bye Baby&quot;; despite the words being in print in 1765.

==Life==
Effie I. Crockett, daughter of Edward and Jennie Crockett, was born 4 March 1856 in Rockland, Knox, Maine, and died 7 January 1940 in Waltham, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. She was married firstly on 30 July 1881 in Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts to John F. Canning, a physician, son of John and Mary Canning, born c.1843 in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, and died 22 June 1888 in Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts. She married secondly in c.1894 to Harry J. Carlton born c.July 1859 in Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts, and died 21 January 1922 in Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts.

The words of &quot;Rock-a-bye Baby&quot; first appeared in print in &quot;Mother Goose&#x27;s Melody&quot; (London, c. 1765), possibly published by John Newbery (1713–1767), and which was reprinted in Boston in 1785. &quot;Rock-a-bye&quot; as a phrase was first recorded in 1805 in Benjamin Tabart&#x27;s &quot;Songs for the Nursery&quot;, (London, 1805).

By one account she created the song in 1872 while minding someone else&#x27;s baby. Her tune was spotted by her banjo teacher and he sent her to have it published in Boston. Because of &quot;Rock-a-bye Baby&quot;, she is credited in over 100 films, many made decades after her death.

&quot;Rock-a-Bye, Baby&quot; is said to have been composed by Effie Crockett Canning in 1886. Her waltz-lullaby has been sung by millions of parents. She says that she used her grandmother&#x27;s surname of Canning when publishing the work as she was unsure of her father&#x27;s reaction to her work.

On stage, Canning appeared opposite William Gillette in his adaption of &quot;The Private Secretary&quot;. She toured in Charles Frohman&#x27;s production of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, played with Mrs. Leslie Carter&#x27;s company, and later had her own repertory company.

Effie I. (Crockett) Canning Carlton and her second husband Harry J. Carlton are buried at Mt. Feake Cemetery, Waltham, Massachusetts.

<text>The 2004 European Parliament election in the Czech Republic was the election of members of the European Parliament (MEPs) representing the Czech Republic for the 2004–2009 term of the European Parliament. It was part of the wider 2004 European election.

These were the first European elections after the country&#x27;s EU accession and hence the first to be held in the Czech Republic. They took place on 11 and 12 June 2004. On a very low turnout, the ruling Czech Social Democratic Party suffered a heavy defeat, losing ground to both the conservative Civic Democratic Party and the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia. The debacle of his party was one of the reasons for the resignation of Prime Minister Vladimír Špidla.

<doc id="740661" wikidata="Q324609" url="?curid=740661" title="Samuel Ullman">
<text>Samuel Ullman (April 13, 1840 – March 21, 1924) was an American businessman, poet, humanitarian, and religious leader. He is best known today for his poem &quot;Youth,&quot; which was a favorite of General Douglas MacArthur. The poem was on the wall of MacArthur&#x27;s office in Tokyo when he became Supreme Allied Commander in Japan. In addition, MacArthur often quoted from the poem in his speeches, leading to it becoming better known in Japan than in the United States.

Born in 1840 at Hechingen, Hohenzollern, to Jewish parents, at age 11 Ullman immigrated with his family to America in 1851 to escape discrimination. The Ullman family settled in Port Gibson, Mississippi. After briefly serving in the Confederate Army, he became a resident of Natchez, Mississippi. There, Ullman married, started a business, served as a city alderman, and was a member of the local board of education.

In 1884, Ullman moved to the young city of Birmingham, Alabama, and was immediately placed on the city&#x27;s first board of education. During his eighteen years of service, he advocated educational benefits for black children similar to those provided for whites. In addition to his numerous community activities, Ullman also served as president and then lay rabbi of the city&#x27;s reform congregation at Temple Emanu-El. Often controversial but always respected, Ullman left his mark on the religious, educational, and community life of Natchez and Birmingham.

In his retirement, Ullman found more time for one of his favorite passions: writing letters, essays and poetry. His poems and poetic essays cover subjects as varied as love, nature, religion, family, the hurried lifestyle of a friend, and living &quot;young.&quot; It was General Douglas MacArthur who facilitated Ullman&#x27;s popularity as a poet — he hung a framed copy of a version of Ullman&#x27;s poem &quot;Youth&quot; on the wall of his office in Tokyo and often quoted from the poem in his speeches. Through MacArthur&#x27;s influence, the people of Japan discovered &quot;Youth&quot; and became curious about the poem&#x27;s author.

In 1924, Ullman died at the age of 83 in Birmingham, Alabama.

In 1994, the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the Japan-America Society of Alabama opened the Samuel Ullman Museum in Birmingham&#x27;s Southside neighborhood. The museum is located in the former Ullman residence and is operated by the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

<text>European Parliament elections were held in Denmark on 13 June 2004 to elect the 14 Danish members of the European Parliament. The opposition Social Democrats made major gains, mainly at the expense of Eurosceptic parties such as the June Movement.

==Results==
Seats were allocated first by the D&#x27;Hondt method to electoral coalitions (Social Democrats + Socialist People&#x27;s Party; Venstre + Conservative People&#x27;s Party; June Movement + People&#x27;s Movement against the EU; Danish Social Liberal Party + Christian Democrats), then subsequently among the parties in each coalition. Compared to straight allocation by party, the People&#x27;s Movement against the EU gained one seat at the expense of the Conservative People&#x27;s Party.

<doc id="740665" wikidata="Q4800882" url="?curid=740665" title="Article 45 Concern Group">
<text>Basic Law Article 45 Concern Group was a pro-democracy political group in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (HKSAR) . It was established on 14 November 2003 by legal practitioners and academics. It had four seats in the Legislative Council of Hong Kong before it transformed into the Civic Party in 2006.

==Beliefs==
The group originated from the &quot;Basic Law Article 23 Concern Group&quot;, which was formed to criticise the HKSAR Government&#x27;s legislative proposals to implement the anti-subversion Article 23 of the Basic Law during the proposed legislations&#x27; consultation period in 2002-2003. Outspoken members of the group included the barristers Audrey Eu, Alan Leong and Ronny Tong, who were all former chairpersons of the Hong Kong Bar Association. Their professional and outspoken image established during the Article 23 controversy has led to them being especially popular with the middle class.

After the HKSAR Government shelved the Article 23 proposals, the group renamed itself the Article 45 Concern Group, with the addition of a few members. Its focus changed to push for universal suffrage in 2007/08. The ultimate aim of universal suffrage for the Chief Executive and the Legislative Council is stipulated under Article 45 and Article 68 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong respectively.

The group considered universal suffrage by 2007/8 as vital to the protection of human rights and the rule of law in Hong Kong, and aimed to promote debates on universal suffrage from a legal and constitutional point of view.

==Elections==
In close collaboration with the democratic camp, several members of the group ran for the 2004 Legislative Council elections and succeeded in gaining four seats in the Council (up from two before the elections). The group remained vocal in criticizing the Chinese and HKSAR Governments for their stance regarding a number of political issues, including the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress of the People&#x27;s Republic of China not to allow universal suffrage in 2007/08. In line with the pan-democratic camp, it supported gathering &quot;the public&#x27;s&quot; view on the issue of universal suffrage by means of a referendum in 2004.

The group vetoed a critical bill concerning the democratisation of the Hong Kong system in December 2005, saying that the democratic reforms were not far-reaching enough, e.g. did not have a set timetable for universal suffrage, and definitely not by 2007/8 as this group was demanding. Ultimately, this led to the Chief Executive for the HKSAR, Donald Tsang, in suggesting that no further reform packages will be introduced for the rest of his current term in office, at least.

==The Civic Party==
The Group disbanded in March 2006 to form what is now the Civic Party. Apart from the Article 45 Concern Group members, Fernando Cheung and Mandy Tam joined as well. The Temporary Executive Committee of the Civic Party was established on 19 February 2006.

==Founding members==

<doc id="740670" wikidata="Q3922732" url="?curid=740670" title="Varela Project">
<text>The Varela Project () is a project that was started in 1998 by Oswaldo Payá of the Christian Liberation Movement (MCL) and named after Felix Varela, a Cuban religious leader.

Many members were imprisoned during the Black Spring in 2003.

==The Varela Project citizens&#x27; initiative==
The purpose of the Varela Project was to circulate a proposal of law advocating for democratic political reforms within Cuba, such as the establishment of freedom of association, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, free elections, freedom of religion, freedom to start private businesses, and amnesty for political prisoners.

About 11,000 Cubans signed the reformist Varela Project citizens&#x27; initiative. The US State Department&#x27;s 2005 report on Cuba in &quot;Country Reports on Human Rights Practices&quot; (issued in 2006) stated that &quot;activists reported increased harassment by State Security agents. Authorities arrested and detained Varela activists, confiscated signatures, fined and threatened activists and signers, and forced signers to rescind signatures. State Security impersonated canvassing volunteers and increasingly infiltrated the ranks of activists. In May and June, Oswaldo Paya reported State Security agents visited and pressured more than 50 Varela Project signatories to retract their signatures and denounce the Varela Project activists who had collected their signatures.&quot; The US State Department&#x27;s 2004 report on Cuba referred to the Cuban Penal Code concept of &quot;dangerousness,&quot; defined as the &quot;special proclivity of a person to commit crimes, demonstrated by his conduct in manifest contradiction of socialist norms.&quot; The report said that &quot;If the police decide that a person exhibits signs of dangerousness, they may bring the offender before a court or subject him to therapy or political reeducation&quot;. According to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, this provision &quot;amounted to a subjective criterion used by the Government to justify violations of individual freedoms and due process for persons whose sole crime was to hold a view different from the official view&quot;.

The Cuban government refused to consider the petition, and the Cuban National Assembly&#x27;s Constitution and Legal Affairs Committee suspended its consideration, and responded to the Varela Project with a &quot;counter-initiative&quot; to enshrine &quot;irrevocable socialism&quot; in the Cuban Constitution. The BBC reported that, over a two-week period, 9 million Cubans took to the streets and 99% of all Cuban citizens signed a petition endorsing the constitutional amendment. The BBC said that many Cubans felt pressured into signing the government&#x27;s petition. An extraordinary session of the National Assembly unanimously approved the amendment in June 2002. The government closed schools, offices, and factory during the session, and nationally televised the speeches; no mention was made of the Varela Project citizens&#x27; initiative during the event.

==Support for Varela Project==
The Cuban exile community in the United States was split on the Varela Project. Many hard-liners opposed the project out of fears that a reformist proposal would legitimize the Castro regime, and a radio commentator at Radio Mambi said that he was fired for publicly supporting the project. The Cuban American National Foundation under Jorge Mas Santos, supported the Varela Project.

The Varela Project was lauded by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter when he made a historic visit to Havana in May 2002 and gave a televised address broadcast throughout Cuba. The European Union awarded Payá the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in December 2002.

==Black Spring (2003)==
The Cuban government dismissed the Varela Project and its petition. The Cuban government said that the project was part of a &quot;counterrevolutionary&quot; plot and &quot;strategy of subversion against Cuba&quot; orchestrated by the United States and the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.

In March 2003, Cuba arrested 75 human rights activists and dissidents, including 25 members of the Varela Project, on a variety of charges. The dissidents were sentenced in public trials to prison terms of between 6 and 28 years for &quot;mercenary activities and other acts against the independence or territorial integrity of the state&quot;. Amnesty International said it was concerned that the 75 jailed activists may be prisoners of conscience who were imprisoned for their non-violent advocacy for democracy. According to the US State Department, many of those arrested had no access to attorneys until the day of their trial, which was by a judge subordinate to the Communist Party. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern regarding the arrests and summary trials.

The US State Department said &quot;Jose Daniel Ferrer Garcia, a Varela Project leader and one of the 75 activists arrested in March 2003, reported serving 45 days in a punishment cell for protesting the suspension of correspondence and the delivery of food and medical supplies from his family. He did not receive food or water during the first 3 days of his confinement and slept on a cement floor. Authorities confiscated his Bible and prohibited any contact with other prisoners. Ferrer was serving a 25 year sentence for &quot;acts against the independence or the territorial integrity of the State.&quot;&quot;

According to the US State Department, &quot;Fabio Prieto Llorente, one of the 75 activists arrested in March 2003, reported he was held in a small cell with leaky walls and a cement slab for a bed. The cell was infested with rats, frogs, and insects&quot;.

The US State Department said &quot;Yarai Reyes, wife of Normando Hernandez Gonzalez, 1 of the 75 political prisoners arrested in March 2003, reported that prison authorities incited common prisoners to beat her husband&quot;.

According to the US State Department &quot;Barbara Rojo Arias, wife of Omar Ruiz Hernandez, an independent journalist and 1 of the 75 human rights activists arrested in March 2003, reported that her husband was denied access to required medications for his heart condition and stomach problems.

The US State Department said &quot;Oscar Espinosa Chepe, a political prisoner released during the year, reported that prison officials regularly denied him adequate medical treatment during his 20-month incarceration&quot;.

The US State Department said that Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet &quot;was sent to a punishment cell for refusing to eat in the prison cafeteria, wear the uniform of common prisoners, and stand at attention when guards entered his cell. He was not permitted to read, write, or leave his cell to get exercise. In addition, prison authorities refused to accept food and medical supplies brought by Morejon or permit anyone to bring him food. As a result, Biscet found himself on a virtual hunger strike&quot;.

<doc id="740673" wikidata="Q126922" url="?curid=740673" title="Petitcodiac River">
<text>The Petitcodiac River is a river located in south-eastern New Brunswick, Canada. Local tourist businesses often refer to it as the &quot;chocolate river&quot; due to its distinctive brown mud floor and brown waters. Stretching across a meander length of , the river traverses Westmorland, Albert, and Kings counties, draining a watershed area of about . The watershed features valleys, ridges, and rolling hills, and is home to a diverse population of terrestrial and aquatic species. Ten named tributaries join the river in its course toward its mouth in Shepody Bay. Prior to the construction of a causeway in 1968, the Petitcodiac River had one of the world&#x27;s largest tidal bores, which ranged from in height and moved at speeds of . With the opening of the causeway gates in April 2010, the river is flushing itself of ocean silts, and the bore is returning to its former size.

The Mi&#x27;kmaq were the first to settle near the river, who used it as part of a portage route between Shubenacadie and the village of Petitcodiac, where they had a winter camp. In 1698, the region was colonized by Acadians from Port Royal, Nova Scotia; however, they were later expelled in 1755 during the Seven Years&#x27; War. During this period, Acadian resistance fighters based in Village-des-Blanchard (now Hillsborough) fought under the command of French leader Charles Deschamps de Boishébert in the Battle of Petitcodiac, attempting to repel British troops but ultimately suffering the destruction of most of their settlement. Three years later, British troops returned to the river and launched the Petitcodiac River Campaign. In the 1840s, the Greater Moncton area experienced a shipbuilding boom, which was halted following the arrival of the steam train, leading to the town&#x27;s de-incorporation. These changes gradually marginalized the Petitcodiac River.

In 1968, a controversial rock-and-earth fill causeway was constructed between Moncton and Riverview to prevent agricultural flooding and to carry a crossing between the two communities. The causeway caused many problems for the river and its surrounding ecosystem. An estimated of silt was deposited in the 4.7 km (2.9 mi) of river downstream from the causeway in the first three years following construction. The causeway restricted the movement of fish and reduced the region&#x27;s salmon catches by 82 percent. Water quality has also dropped thanks to industrial expansion around the area. In 2003, Earthwild International designated the Petitcodiac River as the most endangered river in Canada because of these problems. On 14 April 2010, the causeway&#x27;s gates were opened permanently as part of a $68 million three-phase project designed to restore the river. The causeway was replaced with a bridge, completed in September 2021.

==Etymology==
A commonly held belief suggests that the name &quot;Petitcodiac&quot; originates from the French term &quot;&quot;petit coude&quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;little elbow.&quot; However, the actual derivation of the name is rooted in an indigenous word, likely from Maliseet or possibly Mi&#x27;kmaq language. According to Maliseet Elder and linguist Dr. Peter Paul of Woodstock Reserve, the name refers to a wall of water rushing in: &quot;now they call that &quot;petakuyak.&quot; [It] means &#x27;sound of thunder,&#x27; well, the rush of water coming in like a thunderstorm.&quot; If the term has a Mi&#x27;kmaq origin, it could be linked to &quot;&quot;Petkootkweăk&quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;the river that bends like a bow&quot;, possibly a reference to the river&#x27;s right angle bend near Moncton. The Acadians adapted the name to &quot;Petcoudiac&quot; or &quot;Petitcoudiac&quot;, which was later modified to &quot;Petitcodiac&quot; by British settlers. 

The river gained the nickname &quot;Chocolate River&quot; due to its heavy sedimentation, resulting in a distinctive brown tint. With the construction of the Petitcodiac River Causeway, an additional of sediment began to accumulate in the 4.7 km (2.9 mi) stretch downstream from the causeway.

==Geography==

===Course===


The river measures about from its source near Three Rivers to its mouth at Shepody Bay; its source derives from the confluence of the Anagance and North rivers in western Westmorland County. The Anagance River arises from its tributaries, Hayward Brook and Holmes Brook, and drains from the south-east of the Petitcodiac River, while the North River drains from the north. From the confluence, the river passes under the bridge on Route 106 in Petitcodiac, The road then follows the river to Moncton on the left side of the river. Route 1 crosses the river a few kilometres downstream to join Trans-Canada Highway 2. The community of River Glade precedes Petitcodiac River&#x27;s right tributary, Pollett River, with a watershed of . As the waterway runs past Salisbury, its final major right tributary, Little River (formerly known as Coverdale River), joins it. Little River&#x27;s watershed is . The river passes Coverdale and is joined by Turtle Creek before widening as it approaches Moncton.

The causeway, built in 1968, formed a wall blocking all but of water as the river flowed downstream toward the Gunningsville Bridge. Before the causeway&#x27;s construction, the river&#x27;s area would expand through Moncton, attaining a width of 1.6 km (one mile). A series of banks to both sides precede the 90-degree turn to the south, a feature that gave Moncton its original name, &quot;Le Coude&quot; (The Elbow). The river passes Dieppe on its eastern side and Hillsborough on its western side before it approaches its mouth.

The Memramcook River, which has a watershed area of joins the Petitcodiac River near its mouth. The Petitcodiac River then widens and drains into Shepody Bay, where there is a wetland. Once past the Hopewell Rocks, Shepody Bay merges with the Cumberland Basin, which runs south-west toward Chignecto Bay. Chignecto Bay drains into the Bay of Fundy, which flows into the Gulf of Maine, which proceeds south-east into the Atlantic Ocean through the Northeast Channel.

===Watershed===
The Petitcodiac River watershed is about . The average yearly precipitation in the watershed is , with average temperatures of in the summer and in the winter. The watershed is located in the Kings, Westmorland, and Albert counties in south-east New Brunswick, with some of it crossing into the Caledonian Highlands to the south-east. It borders the Bay of Fundy and three other designated watersheds in the province: the lower Saint John River to the north-west, the Shediac Bay to the north-east, and the Kennebecasis River to the south. Although the Petitcodiac River&#x27;s watershed is geographically distinct from that of the nearby Memramcook River, some groups merge the two for categorisation purposes.

The area has been occupied by Europeans since the late 17th century. Moncton&#x27;s population has grown rapidly since the 19th century, rising from fewer than 100 people in 1825, to over 15,000 people in 1917, and to 126,000 people in 2006. In spite of this growth, most of the area remains relatively undisturbed: 80 percent of the watershed is covered with forest, a tenth is used for agriculture and three percent is occupied by wetlands. Only four percent of the area is used for commercial, residential, or private usage. Nevertheless, the Petitcodiac Watershed Monitoring Group noted in 2001 that this growth is one of the main factors for the ongoing &quot;environmental degradation&quot; of the river.

==Hydrology==

===Water quality===
The Petitcodiac River was listed in 2003 as the most endangered river in Canada by Earthwild International, and was listed second, behind Quebec&#x27;s Rupert River, in 2002. The causeway was cited as one of the major factors behind the river&#x27;s degraded health. The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment&#x27;s Water Quality Index gave two study sites an &quot;excellent&quot; rating, 20 sites a &quot;good&quot; rating, 27 sites a &quot;fair&quot; rating, and five sites a &quot;marginal&quot; rating.

Since 1999, the Petitcodiac Watershed Alliance (known as the Petitcodiac Watershed Monitoring Group at the time) has collected water samples from May to October to study bacteria, nutrient, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and sediment levels. Two sampling sites, one upstream from the causeway and one downstream, were used during the 2009 study. The river had an average temperature of in August at the upstream location, in contrast to the average of at the same site over the total period of the study. &quot;E. coli&quot; levels were high upstream, and above recreationally safe levels downstream in June, July, and August. Nitrates and phosphates failed to meet the safe quality threshold on occasion. A publication by the New Brunswick Department of Environment in 2007 showed that the watershed did not meet the quality guidelines for &quot;E. coli&quot; in 10 percent of samples, for dissolved oxygen in 5 percent of samples, and pH in 3 percent of samples; in contrast, the river was always within safe nitrate levels.

During their 2001 study, the Petitcodiac Watershed Alliance noted the effects of agriculture on the river&#x27;s water quality, and recommended to work with local farmers to install cattle fencing around streams which run through their properties, and &quot;eventually phase out&quot; cosmetic pesticide usage. The Petitcodiac Riverkeeper holds a stronger position on the issue: the organisation notes that pesticides &quot;find their way into the surface and ground water by leaching into the soil or as part of stormwater runoff.&quot; They request that, while measures have been taken in 2009 by the provincial government to regulate cosmetic pesticide usage, the province must forbid its usage altogether and require chemical manufacturers to disclose health warnings and all ingredients on labels. The New Brunswick Department of Environment also warned of the erosion caused by the removal of the river&#x27;s riparian zones, which is a common &quot;land use practice&quot;.

Although mining around the area essentially stopped with the closure of the gypsum mines in 1982, uranium mining has surfaced as a potential problem for the river. The province was the subject of a controversy in 2007 when it gave Vale Limited (formerly known as CVRD Inco) the right to mine for uranium at Turtle Creek, where the Greater Moncton water reservoir is maintained. Environmentalists warned of the dangers related to the move, fearing that contaminants could be pushed into the surrounding water. The Petitcodiac Riverkeeper also noted uranium mining&#x27;s &quot;irreversible effects to the health of ecosystems, watersheds, wildlife, agriculture, recreation, and public health&quot;, and joined 30 other environmental groups in asking the provincial government to establish a ban on the act. The province would later restrict uranium mining to from residential areas and ban it from protected drinking water areas. Another controversy in 2006 involved exploration for oil and gas deposits in the same area, but access was blocked by the municipal government.

Shortly after the building of the causeway, a landfill was built near the river. Various materials were disposed of in the area, including petroleum waste oil, pipe and foam insulation, sewage sludge, and medical waste. While the landfill was shut down in 1992, samples by the Environmental Bureau of Investigation and the Petitcodiac Riverkeeper showed that ammonium levels around the leachate exceeded Canadian quality guidelines by as much as 15 times, and contained heavy metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, and PCBs. A mortality rate of 100 percent was found for test trout and daphnia when exposed to water samples. Gemtec Limited, the company responsible for planning and closing the landfill, and the City of Moncton were charged on 12 March 2002, for offences relating to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (1999) and the Fisheries Act. The city pleaded guilty on 23 September 2003, paid a $35,000 fine, and was ordered to help reduce the leachate flow from the landfill. Three years later, Gemtec Limited was fined a total of $6,000 and was ordered to contribute a total of $22,000 to the federal Environmental Damages Fund and the Jonathan Creek Committee.

===Discharge===
The river aids in the drainage of ten significant bodies of water: Weldon Creek, Fox Creek, Mill Creek, Halls Creek, Jonathan Creek, Turtle Creek, Little River, Pollett River, Anagance River, and North River. A report in 2000 showed that it handles an average discharge of at the causeway yearly, with a recorded high of in 1962 and a low of in 1966. The same report estimated mean values for the minimum and maximum discharges for every two-year, 10-year, and 100-year flood events, and minimum discharges for every two-year, five-year, and 100-year &quot;drought&quot; events:


===Tidal bore===
The Petitcodiac River tidal bores—retrograde waves moving upstream over downstream waves—occur twice a day and come from the world&#x27;s highest tides in the Bay of Fundy. The first European mention of the bore was by British Lieutenant Colonel George Scott on 17 November 1758, during a downstream voyage from Moncton to Fort Frederick, near Saint John. The Admiralty referred to the tidal bore in a hydrographic chart published in 1861, observing that &quot;[after] its passage the rise of the tide is very rapid until high water is attained&quot;, and that &quot;[during the lowest tides] the Bore still appears but its broken front usually is only a few inches high.&quot;

The bores ranged from in height, with speeds from . In 1825, Peter Fisher noted that the &quot;noise of the Bore is heard a great distance, and animals immediately take to the highland, and manifest visible signs of terror if near it.&quot; Before the causeway (1968), values were compared with the tidal bores of the Qiantang, Hooghly and Amazon rivers. After the causeway was built, the bores reached heights from about .

==Wildlife==
Before the construction of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of Atlantic tomcod and rainbow smelt, tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the blueback herring, the brown bullhead, the chain pickerel, the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included the brook floater, the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern elliptio, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater. Many other aquatic organisms are thought to have once entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.

Six species have disappeared from the river since the mid-1980s. The Petitcodiac River was the only known Canadian habitat of the dwarf wedgemussel, and was later isolated to just nine American watersheds after its elimination from the Petitcodiac. The Atlantic salmon is no longer present in the watershed, and has since been listed as an endangered species in Canada. The American shad was a favourite with fishermen, and represented two-thirds of the entire Canadian shad landings from 1870 to 1900; catches peaked at  million kilograms (two to six million pounds) per year. Three other species have been eliminated from the river: the striped bass, the Atlantic sturgeon, and the Atlantic tomcod. However, a project of the Petitcodiac Riverkeeper, funded by the Government of Canada&#x27;s Environmental Damage Fund in 2005, noted that the removal of the causeway would result in a &quot;good&quot; chance of bringing back the eliminated species, and an &quot;excellent&quot; chance of increasing the numbers of species deemed to have been reduced in numbers. No data has been released for the Atlantic salmon or the striped bass.

Various insects and arachnids reside around the Petitcodiac River. Among them is the stonefly, the mayfly, the caddisfly, the &quot;simulium&quot;, the subfamily of tanypodinae, and the Hydracarina. Non-native species, such as the black-footed spider, the beech scale, the white-marked tussock moth, and the mountain ash sawfly have also made their home in the Petitcodiac River watershed. At the southern extremities of the watershed, 50 to 90 percent of the world&#x27;s semipalmated sandpipers feed on the mud shrimp at Shepody Bay. Around 269,445 stop there before migrating to South America, a number which accounts for at least 7.7 percent of the total population. Among others, the semipalmated plover (around 2 percent of the North American population), the short-billed dowitcher, the red knot, the sanderling, and the least sandpiper are also known for migrating through the Important Bird Area.

A diverse number of plant species reside in the watershed as well. Red, white, and black spruce, red maple, white birch, and trembling aspen are the most common. Jack pine is commonly found in regions that fires have repeatedly ravished, while cedar is found in bogs and areas where gypsum and limestone are present. Higher altitude slopes and ridgetops house sugar maple, beech, and yellow birch trees. Zelazny et al. note that &quot;[the] high frequency of disturbed sites dominated by aspen stands reveals the degree of historical and recent human disturbance along the Petitcodiac River.&quot; The Petitcodiac River&#x27;s riparian zone houses a number of trees, including willows, white spruce, white pine, and speckled alder. Other trees, such as the tamarack and white pine, can also be found in the watershed. Plants such as the rufous bulrush tend to grow near calcareous areas, and hemlock can be found in small, pure stands. Alien plant species include the mother-of-thyme, the Japanese barberry, the Scotch broom, the yellow flag, and Canada bluegrass.

In 1937, the 37,000-year-old skeleton of a mastodon was discovered by workers near Hillsborough. It was in near perfect condition and was transported to the New Brunswick Museum in Saint John, where it has been displayed ever since.

==Geology==
The Petitcodiac River watershed covers an area north and east of the Caledonian Highlands; a low-elevation (on average 67 m; ) region with rolling hills, valleys, and ridges. In fact, most of the region was below sea level, beneath the former DeGeer and Goldthwait seas, during the quaternary period. Non-calcareous Pennsylvanian (and younger) sandstones, conglomerates, silt, and red- to grey-tinted mudstone now compose the majority of the bedrock. The northern shore of the Petitcodiac River, including the Anagance and North rivers, is primarily made up of shale with volcanic rocks, mixed igneous rocks, and felsic pebble conglomerates. The southern shore, including the Little and Pollett rivers, is composed of Precambrian or Lower-Palaeozoic sedimentary, igneous, and volcanic rocks, and limestone. Both shores include red to grey Mississippian sandstone. Red beds, or red-tinted sedimentary rocks, have a higher occurrence around Strait Shores. Other significant Mississippian-era rock patches appear in two areas around the watershed. The first is located near the north-western border of the watershed, near Lutes Mountain and Cornhill. The second ranges from the east of the Memramcook River to the west of Hillsborough, in Beech Hill. The Petitcodiac River watershed also features karst topography, where gypsum and limestone around Mississippian rocks dilute into the circulating groundwater. This creates sinkholes, depressions, and caves. Examples of rare karst occurrences appear west of the village of Three Rivers, where large sinkholes alternate between small ridges to form honeycomb-shaped patterns. Hillsborough is the home of one of the longest gypsum cave networks in eastern Canada, and is a key habitat for bats in hibernation.

The majority of the watershed&#x27;s topsoil is composed of sand, clay, and silt, under which normally lies a layer of ablation moraines. Fairly rich soils made of alluvium and tidal deposits are found along the Petitcodiac and Memramcook rivers, and have often been exploited for agricultural purposes. A publication by the New Brunswick Department of Natural Resources notes that the soils in Salisbury, made from calcareous sandstone and mudstone, are fine-textured and, when properly drained, &quot;are the most fertile glacial tills&quot; in the watershed. In contrast, they note, soils deriving from local conglomerates are more coarse and sandy, and are less fertile.

Albertite, a type of asphalt, was first found in Albert County in 1849 by the Canadian geologist Abraham Gesner, inventor of kerosene. Over 200,000 tonnes of the mineral were shipped to Boston within 30 years. Large deposits of gypsum found eight kilometres (five miles) from the mining site were shipped around the globe as well. The Petitcodiac River was used as the primary means for transporting the minerals at the time.

==History==

===Colonisation (1604–1698)===

The Petitcodiac River region was first settled by the Mi&#x27;kmaq, who used the river&#x27;s upstream current as part of a portage route between Shubenacadie and a winter camp at the confluence of the Anagance and North rivers. The first Europeans arrived in early 1604, when a French expedition to Acadia (now Nova Scotia and New Brunswick), led by the explorer Pierre Dugua de Mons and accompanied by cartographer Samuel de Champlain and future Acadian governor Jean de Biencourt, sailed into the Bay of Fundy. Hoping to find an ideal site for a settlement, they passed Advocate Harbour and the Saint John River before Dugua chose to settle on Saint Croix Island in present-day Maine. Although they did not explore the Petitcodiac region, they returned to the coasts of eastern Nova Scotia, where they founded Port Royal. In 1676, Jacques Bourgeois, a colonist from the Nova Scotian settlement, settled in the area of Beaubassin (now the Tantramar Marshes). By 1685, its population had grown to 129, with 19 out of the 22 families living permanently in the region. Pierre Thibodeau, also from Port Royal, founded Chipody (Chipoudie) near Shepody Bay in 1698. At this time, the inhabitants often referred to the Petitcodiac, Memramcook, and Shepody River area as &quot;Trois-Rivières&quot; (Three Rivers) (not to be confused with Trois-Rivières, Quebec).

===Acadian History (1698–1763)===
The French and Indian War erupted in 1754 amid tensions between the British and the French over control of the Ohio Valley. Initially, the inhabitants of Acadia were uninvolved in the conflict because the French had already ceded the land to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht (1713). The Acadians were asked to take an oath declaring complete fidelity toward the British monarch on several occasions, but they refused. At first, they were not punished for doing so. A declaration of neutrality was signed in 1730 and was accepted by Nova Scotia governor Richard Philipps. This earned the Acadians the nickname the &quot;neutral French&quot;. At the outbreak of war in 1754, the British again demanded unconditional oaths of fealty, perceiving the Acadians as a possible threat. In spite of resistance led by Jean-Louis Le Loutre, representatives eventually agreed to sign, but their reluctance persuaded Governor Charles Lawrence to order the Acadian population expelled from British territory.

About 1,100 Acadians living around the Petitcodiac River were affected by this decision. Two hundred British troops led by Major Joseph Frye were sent to destroy the settlements of the Three Rivers, beginning with Shepody and Village-des-Blanchard (now Hillsborough). French resistance commander Charles Deschamps de Boishébert, hoping to evacuate as many Acadians as possible, was unable to march the distance between Nerepis and the Shepody settlement in time, but fought at the second threatened village on 28 August 1755. Boishébert&#x27;s troops, composed of inhabitants from the area and from Shepody, counter-attacked, suffering only one loss to twenty-three British casualties. This defeat is thought to have been the reason for the British abandonment of the campaign at the Three Rivers. The commander and the evacuated Acadians, whom Edward Larracey estimated to total around 700, suffered a massive famine from 1756 to 1758, largely caused by the scarce resources following the battle.
In 1758, Joseph Broussard, also known as Beausoleil by the locals, led raids against British vessels sailing in the Bay of Fundy and the Cumberland Basin. This provoked the British into initiating two raids of their own. The first took place in February in Shediac, where Lieutenant Colonel George Scott tried to find Boishébert. When they were returning, Boishébert ambushed them, killing two of Scott&#x27;s gunmen. The second raid took place at the settlement of Shepody in March, where the British were shocked to find that the Acadians had already begun rebuilding their homes. On 28 June, Scott learned of reports that cattle were stolen outside of Fort Beausejour; the British issued an order for Captain Beloni Danks to send 75 men up the Petitcodiac River. They arrived in Moncton the following night, and about 30 Acadians began firing at their vessel. However, Danks held his offensive position, and the British killed 19 Acadians, taking nine others prisoner. He and his troops continued to sail up the river the next day; they sent 60 men to burn a settlement west of Moncton. Historians presume that the area had already been deserted.

Acadians continued to survive in the region, overcoming the results of the raids. Scott sailed back to the region to search for Beausoleil and to weaken the Acadians before the winter. He arrived in Moncton near midnight on 12 November, but the tide of the Petitcodiac River prevented him from sending more than twelve men. They came back the next morning with 16 prisoners. Scott was told that the area was virtually defenceless, so he sent three parties to La Chapelle (now Bore Park in Moncton), Silvabro (now Lewisville), and Jagersome (now Dieppe). Scott recorded no deaths or prisoners, but all buildings in sight were burned, and cattle were brought back onto the vessel. Additional raids by Scott between 14 and 17 November captured a dozen Acadian prisoners, burned settlements, and uncovered Beausoleil&#x27;s own schooner. The crew sent an Acadian prisoner on the 17th to request the surrender of the remaining residents, but when he returned, he reported that they had all begun to flee to Cocagne, Shediac, and the settlements around the Miramichi River. This prompted Scott to return to Fort Frederick in Saint John.

A few of the Acadians migrating to the Miramichi River probably died of hypothermia during the trip due to the 1758–59 winter. Those who survived joined the refugees already present, who had been persuaded by Boishébert to seek refuge there. Inadequate housing and supplies, among other reasons, led to the deterioration of the reputation of the French commander, and only 700 Acadians remained there by late 1759. Meanwhile, the raiding rapidly took its toll on the residents who stayed around the Three Rivers, as food supplies became scarce and reconstruction became impossible. The fall of Quebec City in September 1759 also eliminated the possibility of assistance from that area. On 16 November 1759, the 190 Acadians in the region sent a delegate to Fort Beauséjour (which had been renamed Fort Cumberland) to announce their surrender to the newly promoted Colonel Frye. The settlements of Miramichi, Richibucto, and Bouctouche surrendered the next day, with a delegate sent to the fort to represent their 700 refugees. Frye requested and received permission from Governor Lawrence to take them in for the winter. The Acadian refugees were offered land on the Isthmus of Chignecto in early 1760, but most requested their original lands around the Three Rivers, which the governor granted.
===Resettlement and Modern History (1763–present)===
After the Treaty of Paris (1763), exiled Acadians began to return to the area, but their numbers around the Three Rivers remained under 200 by 1769. Settlers from Philadelphia began to migrate to the Petitcodiac River area in 1766: the Trites, Jones and Stieff families moved to present-day Moncton, but the Stieff family (now Steeves), later moved south-east to Hillsborough. Nine families bought land up to west from the bend of the river, ranging from per grant. In 1829, the population of Moncton reached 100, composed mainly of descendants of these settlers.

Moncton&#x27;s shipbuilding era began in 1840 with the arrival of Stewart Russell, a shipbuilder from Hopewell. Russell built the &quot;Aginora&quot;, which sailed down the Petitcodiac River to trade at the ports in Saint John and New England. The ship and its crew sank in a storm on 24 December 1850, during a trip to Boston for Christmas. A ferry service on the Petitcodiac River was launched around 1841, thanks to a license obtained by Simon Outhouse. The &quot;Larch&quot;, built by Stephen Binney in 1845, was another important vessel, becoming the largest to sail on the river. But it was not until the arrival of Joseph Salter in 1846 that the shipbuilding boom began: a shipyard founded by Binney and Salter produced 24 vessels from 1847 to 1859, and employed almost 500 of the 1,000 inhabitants in Moncton. Salter would become the first mayor of Moncton in April 1855, the year the town was incorporated.

The European and North American Railway was extended to link Pointe-du-Chene to Moncton in 1857, with an eventual goal of reaching Saint John in 1860. The move, according to Larracey, caused the town to become &quot;but a station stop along a railway line&quot;. This coincided with the failure of Moncton&#x27;s shipbuilding industry and a population drop from a peak of 2,000 to about 500. The town declared bankruptcy and was unincorporated in 1862, but it later regained its status in 1875, after it became the Intercolonial Railway&#x27;s headquarters for its shops in 1871. While the Petitcodiac River continued to aid in the shipping of goods into the 20th century, shipbuilding essentially ended in the 1890s. The final vessel built in Moncton was the &quot;Woolastook II&quot; on 14 May 1980, while the final ship to sail up the Petitcodiac River was the &quot;Inox&quot; from France, which arrived on 12 July 1986, (and was, ironically, stranded in Moncton until 3 November due to the river&#x27;s tidal fluctuations).

In 1924, the Petitcodiac Tidal Power Company proposed a tidal power project. This called for a dam to be built between Hopewell Cape and Fort Folly Point. The company sold shares to raise funds for the project and a series of on-site and airborne studies were conducted by the federal government, but the project fell through by 1928. As rail transport became more common, it displaced river transportation around the Great Depression. In addition, the Greater Moncton International Airport offered an airmail service from Moncton to Montreal by 29 December 1929. These factors further marginalised the Petitcodiac.

The Gunningsville Bridge, which crosses the Petitcodiac River to link Moncton and Riverview, was built in 1867. It was damaged and rebuilt on four different occasions. The first was following the Saxby Gale of 1869, which forced the town to rebuild the bridge in 1872. It went under &quot;extensive repairs&quot; mid-1892, but ice build-up from the Petitcodiac continued to pose a threat for the wooden structure, leading to the construction of a new steel version from 1915 to 1919. This fourth bridge would suffer through many collisions, including one with the &quot;Mayflower&quot; in September 1929, which caused the ship to capsize and drown two men. The Gunningsville Bridge would last 86 years before it would be demolished a final time, making way for a four-lane bridge crossing. Covered bridges were also built over the Petitcodiac River, the final extant one being &quot;Hasty&quot;, built in 1929.


===Causeway Controversy (1968–present)===
In 1968, the provincial and federal governments completed the construction of a causeway between the communities of Moncton and Riverview, to provide a crossing over the river, and to keep water levels from impeding agricultural production. This was a benefit for the federal government at the time, which had constantly maintained the dykes in the area. It also benefited the provincial government, as the federal government was willing to fund the $3 million project, but not a bridge. Although the causeway was equipped with a fishway, problems arose when fish were unable to cross it freely due to sedimentation build-up; some 82 percent of the salmon were prevented from travelling upstream by the structure. The sediment accumulated in the of river downstream from the causeway, with over 10 million cubic metres (13 million cubic yards) of silt deposited in the first three years following construction. Several reports from 1969 to 1971 described its impact on the aquatic ecosystem, and proposals for amendments to the causeway gates were released, but no action was taken. In 1976 and 1977, reports pointed out several problems related to the gates&#x27; function due to erosion, winter ice jams, and &quot;unsatisfactory fishway operation&quot;.

It was not until 1978 that New Brunswick&#x27;s Department of Transportation commissioned a study of the problems. The final report recommended three alternatives for action: to continue operation &quot;as-is&quot;, to continue operation without the gates, or to eliminate gate leakage and amend the operation protocol. The third alternative was chosen two years later, but did not substantially improve fish migration as expected. The provincial government decided to open the gates between 15 April and 7 July 1988, to allow fish to migrate up the stream. This was repeated from 26 September to 31 October 1988, and in the spring of 1989 and 1990 during low tides. In 1991, New Brunswick&#x27;s Department of Oceans and Fisheries recommended opening the gates from April to December each year. A provincial government committee report recommended an additional seven options for the modification of the causeway in May 1992, but the government did not act upon any of these options due to the low &quot;cost-benefit&quot; factor. More reports documented problems related to the passage of fish in the river until 1995, when the Department of Transportation agreed to open one gate from April to December, as suggested four years earlier. A project was then organized in December 1996 to begin a trial for the systematic opening of the gates during the year, but conditions could not be physically met, and it was terminated on 1 June 1999.

In February 2001, the &quot;Niles Report&quot; proposed an additional four modifications to the causeway project: to either replace the fishway, open the gates during peak fish migration, open the gates permanently, or replace the entire causeway with a bridge. An Environmental Impact Assessment study was commissioned in 2003 to develop and summarise these options, and on its completion in 2005, it announced the recognition of &quot;Option 3&quot; and &quot;Option 4&quot; as possible solutions. The first option had been ruled out following the evaluation of other fish passage models, which were deemed inapplicable to the river. The second, suggesting systematic gate-opening periods, was ruled out because of the inability to cater to every marine species&#x27; migration periods. Option 4 was split into three sub-options, mainly to list possible bridge lengths: 170, 280, and 315 metres (190, 310, and 344 yards). The provincial government later accepted the proposal on 6 December 2006, and selected &quot;Option 4B&quot; on 7 August 2007, which called for a bridge in the place of the causeway.

The project was divided into three phases, expected to cost a total of $68 million. Phase 1 consisted of the prevention of erosion along the shorelines, improvements to the nearby drainage system, and the construction of dikes and &quot;aboiteaux&quot;; the work was carried out from 7 July 2008, to 14 April 2010. Phase 2 consisted of opening the gates to monitor river flow, both upstream and downstream, for two years. Phase 3 commenced in 2012 and consisted of the bridge&#x27;s development and the removal of the causeway, which was completed on 17 September 2021. Confusion arose as to whether or not the project would be funded by the federal government. They refused, in spite of an earlier comment from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, which had hinted at a possible negotiation. Unwilling to wait, the provincial government came forward with an initial $20 million on 7 July 2008, to begin the first phase.

The approach of Phase 2 was met with various complaints. A biology professor at the Université de Moncton noted that $200,000–$250,000 worth of pesticide would be required to keep the mosquito population around the city of Moncton from doubling once the gates open. Flood warnings were issued by the provincial Department of Supply and Services for the town of Riverview, warning that high river tides could lead to the flooding of over of sport fields and structures built in low-lying areas; however, they added that the causeway&#x27;s flood gates were able to descend if required, eliminating the chances of such repercussions from a possible inundation. Residents near the headpond west of the causeway criticized the project, citing the decrease in property values of about 480 homes (by approximately 30 percent, according to the EIA report), the $68 million price tag, unstable ice conditions, and a lower water quality. In spite of legal threats by the Lake Petitcodiac Preservation Association (LAPPA) and various residents, the causeway opened its gates on 14 April 2010, coinciding with the beginning of various studies.

Since the opening, the river improved significantly, surpassing original expectations for the project. An AMEC engineer participating in the firm&#x27;s studies, Jacques Paynter, said that the banks of the river had begun widening &quot;at a noticeable pace&quot;, with the tidal bore growing closer to its pre-1968 levels: &quot;We were actually anticipating a fairly modest increase in height. It seems to be already exceeding what we might have expected.&quot; He noted that an estimated 40,000 gaspereau had returned to the river, and called for more studies to determine the impact of the causeway&#x27;s opening.

==Recreation==

Residents around the Petitcodiac have used the river for various recreational purposes. Trips were made annually via the river from Moncton to Beaumont for Feast of Saint-Anne celebrations with the locals. The &quot;Blakeson&quot;, a towboat owned by Blakeny and Sons, offered &quot;moonlight cruises&quot; in the early 1930s for 50 cents (approximately $6.50 in 2010 values). The service was popular until the towboat capsized in front of embarking passengers, causing them to lose interest. During their Environmental Impact Assessment in September 2005, AMEC cited recreational fishing and birdwatching as major pre-causeway activities. A fishery for Atlantic salmon existed downstream from the causeway for several years post-1968. The Moncton Naturalists&#x27; Club also publishes their &quot;Birding in the Moncton Area&quot;, a birdwatching guide covering sites from Sackville to Mary&#x27;s Point. Other activities downstream from the causeway include boating, canoeing, kayaking, seal and harbour-porpoise viewing, and tour boating. On 24 July 2013, the North American record for surfing a single river wave was set by Wessels and Whitbread of California, who rode the Petitcodiac River&#x27;s tidal bore .

Before the opening of the causeway gates on 14 April 2010, the Petitcodiac River&#x27;s headpond (west of the causeway), colloquially known as Lake Petitcodiac, was promoted by LAPPA as a recreational haven for residents in the area. According to the association, over 10,000 estimated hours of boating took place on the lake, in addition to canoeing, kayaking, motor boating, water skiing, jet skiing, sailing, and swimming. Fishing tournaments, dragon boat regattas, dog sledding, and snowmobiling were popular at the time as well. However, a study by the PWMG showed that fecal coliform levels in the headpond from June, July, and September 2009 exceeded 2,419 parts per 100 millilitres; more than 12 times the 200/100 ml recommended by the Canadian Water Quality Guidelines for recreational purposes.

Bore Park, located in the area formerly known as La Chapelle, became a popular tourist location by 1907 for watching the Petitcodiac&#x27;s tidal bore move up the river twice a day. The area features information about the wave, as well as a clock indicating the time of its next appearance. Bore Park is a part of Riverfront Park, Greater Moncton&#x27;s section of the Trans Canada Trail, where tourists may walk, bike, or skate along the riverfront. The trail continues west to Hillsborough and Fundy National Park, and east to Sackville, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. Jonathan Creek, Fox Creek, Halls Creek, and Mills Creek also offer trails that run along their streams.

<doc id="740674" wikidata="Q455096" url="?curid=740674" title="SS Sołdek">
<text>SS &quot;Sołdek&quot; is a retired Polish coal and ore cargo steamship. She was the first ship built in Gdańsk (Poland) after World War II, and the first seagoing ship completed in Poland. She was the first of 29 ships classed as Project B30, built between 1949 and 1954 in the Gdańsk Shipyard. The name was given in honour of Stanisław Sołdek, one of the shipyard&#x27;s shock workers.

&quot;Sołdek&quot; is often confused with &quot;Oliwa&quot;, a former unfinished Hansa type A cargo ship, which was commissioned after &quot;Sołdek&quot;, however which&#x27;s hull was already built in 1944. It was abandoned by the Germans on a slipway in Szczecin, and seized by Poland. Following this the hull was completed and the ship launched as &quot;Oliwa&quot;. Later she was renamed and entered service in 1951 as &quot;Marchlewski&quot;, serving the Polish Ocean Lines. Many sources incorrectly state that &quot;Oliwa&quot; was &quot;Sołdek&quot;&#x27;s makeshift name during her launch, and that she was later relaunched again as &quot;Sołdek&quot;.

The ship is currently preserved as a museum ship in Gdańsk, as a part of National Maritime Museum collection.

The ship was used in the film &quot;Persona Non Grata&quot; as a Japanese steamer transporting Jews from Vladivostok to Tsuraga.

<text>An election for Members of the European Parliament representing Estonia constituency for the 2004–2009 term of the European Parliament was held on 13 June 2004. It was part of the wider 2004 European election.

The election was conducted using the D&#x27;Hondt method with open list. The voter turnout in Estonia was one of the lowest of all member countries at only 26.8%. A similar trend was visible in most of the new member states that joined the EU in 2004.

The biggest winner was the Social Democratic Party, due to the popularity of their leading candidate Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who received the vast majority of the party&#x27;s votes. The governing Res Publica Party and People&#x27;s Union polled poorly. Ilves went on to become President of Estonia in October 2006, leaving his MEP seat to Katrin Saks.

<text>The Liverpool Telescope (LT) is a two-metre-aperture robotic Ritchey–Chrétien telescope that observes autonomously (without human intervention). However professional astronomers, school groups and other credible registered users submit specifications to be considered by its robotic control system (RCS) at any time using an online graphical user interface. Each night the RCS decides among these choices, and among any notified or glimpsed transient events, what to observe, based on target visibility and weather conditions.

The telescope had first light in 2003, and is the brainchild and property of Liverpool John Moores University.

== Description ==
The RCS has a rapid-response capability where it will often automatically interrupt regular observations to slew (shift) to observe short-lived events with higher priority, such as gamma-ray bursts.

The LT is one of the largest robotic telescopes in the world and was built by a subsidiary set up by Liverpool John Moores University who own and masterminded it. It is operated (maintained) by the Astrophysics Research Institute, partly funded by the UK&#x27;s STFC. It is at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma.

Along with the Faulkes Telescope North and South, it is available for use by school children around the world over the internet. The registration and time allocation for the LT is organised by the National Schools Observatory.

The Liverpool Telescope is one of the primary players in the Heterogeneous Telescope Networks Consortium, a global collaboration between major research groups in the field of robotic telescopes which seeks a standard for communication between remote telescopes, telescope users, and other scientific resources.

Plans for an improved version, the Liverpool Telescope 2, are underway.

<doc id="740680" wikidata="Q560430" url="?curid=740680" title="Radar cross section">
<text>Radar cross-section (RCS), denoted σ, also called radar signature, is a measure of how detectable an object is by radar. A larger RCS indicates that an object is more easily detected.

An object reflects a limited amount of radar energy back to the source. The factors that influence this include:
*the material with which the target is made;
*the size of the target relative to the wavelength of the illuminating radar signal;
*the absolute size of the target;
*the incident angle (angle at which the radar beam hits a particular portion of the target, which depends upon the shape of the target and its orientation to the radar source);
*the reflected angle (angle at which the reflected beam leaves the part of the target hit; it depends upon incident angle);
*the polarization of the radiation transmitted and received with respect to the orientation of the target.

While important in detecting targets, strength of emitter and distance are not factors that affect the calculation of an RCS because RCS is a property of the target&#x27;s reflectivity.

Radar cross-section is used to detect airplanes in a wide variation of ranges. For example, a stealth aircraft (which is designed to have low detectability) will have design features that give it a RCS (such as absorbent paint, flat surfaces, surfaces specifically angled to reflect the signal somewhere other than towards the source), as opposed to a passenger airliner that will have a RCS (bare metal, rounded surfaces effectively guaranteed to reflect some signal back to the source, many protrusions like the engines, antennas, etc.). RCS is integral to the development of radar stealth technology, particularly in applications involving aircraft and ballistic missiles. RCS data for current military aircraft is mostly highly classified.

In some cases, it is of interest to look at an area on the ground that includes many objects. In those situations, it is useful to use a related quantity called the normalized radar cross-section (NRCS), also known as differential scattering coefficient or radar backscatter coefficient, denoted σ0 or σ0 (&quot;sigma nought&quot;), which is the average radar cross-section of a set of objects per unit area:
:formula_1
where:
* σ is the radar cross-section of a particular object, and
* A is the area on the ground associated with that object.
The NRCS has units of area per area, or in MKS units.

==Formulation==

Informally, the RCS of an object is the cross-sectional area of a perfectly reflecting sphere that would produce the same strength reflection as would the object in question. (Bigger sizes of this imaginary sphere would produce stronger reflections.) Thus, RCS is an abstraction: the radar cross-sectional area of an object does not necessarily bear a direct relationship with the physical cross-sectional area of that object but depends upon other factors.

Somewhat less informally, the RCS of a radar target is an effective area that intercepts the transmitted radar power and then scatters that power isotropically back to the radar receiver.

More precisely, the RCS of a radar target is the hypothetical area required to intercept the transmitted power density at the target such that if the total intercepted power were re-radiated isotropically, the power density actually observed at the receiver is produced. This statement can be understood by examining the monostatic (radar transmitter and receiver co-located) radar equation one term at a time:

:formula_2

where
*formula_3 = transmitter&#x27;s input power (watts)
*formula_4 = gain of the radar transmit antenna (dimensionless)
*formula_5 = distance from the radar to the target (meters)
*formula_6 = radar cross-section of the target (meters squared)
*formula_7 = effective area of the radar receiving antenna (meters squared)
*formula_8 = power received back from the target by the radar (watts)

The
formula_9
term in the radar equation represents the power density (watts per meter squared) that the radar transmitter produces at the target. This power density is intercepted by the target with radar cross-section formula_10, which has units of area (meters squared). Thus, the product
formula_11
has the dimensions of power (watts), and represents a hypothetical total power intercepted by the radar target. The second formula_9 term represents isotropic spreading of this intercepted power from the target back to the radar receiver. Thus, the product
formula_13
represents the reflected power density at the radar receiver (again watts per meter squared). The receiver antenna then collects this power density with effective area formula_14, yielding the power received by the radar (watts) as given by the radar equation above.

The scattering of incident radar power by a radar target is never isotropic (even for a spherical target), and the RCS is a hypothetical area. In this light, RCS can be viewed as a correction factor that makes the radar equation &quot;work out right&quot; for the experimentally observed ratio of formula_15. However, RCS is a property of the target alone and may be measured or calculated. Thus, RCS allows the performance of a radar system with a given target to be analysed independent of the radar and engagement parameters. In general, RCS is a function of the orientation of the radar and target. A target&#x27;s RCS depends on its size, &quot;reflectivity&quot; of its surface, and the &quot;directivity&quot; of the radar return caused by the target&#x27;s geometric shape.

== Factors ==

=== Size ===
As a rule, the larger an object, the stronger its radar reflection and thus the greater its RCS. Also, radar of one band may not even detect certain size objects. For example, 10 cm (S-band radar) can detect rain drops but not clouds whose droplets are too small.

=== Material ===
Materials such as metal are strongly radar reflective and tend to produce strong signals. Wood and cloth (such as portions of airplanes and balloons used to be commonly made) or plastic and fibreglass are less reflective or indeed transparent to radar making them suitable for radomes. Even a very thin layer of metal can make an object strongly radar reflective. Chaff is often made from metallised plastic or glass (in a similar manner to metallised foils on food stuffs) with microscopically thin layers of metal.

Also, some devices are designed to be Radar active, such as radar antennas and this will increase RCS.

==== Radar absorbent paint ====
The SR-71 Blackbird and other aircraft were painted with a special &quot;iron ball paint&quot; that consisted of small metallic-coated balls. Radar energy received is converted to heat rather than being reflected.

=== Shape, directivity and orientation ===
The surfaces of the F-117A are designed to be flat and very angled. This has the effect that radar will be incident at a large angle (to the normal ray) that will then bounce off at a similarly high reflected angle; it is forward-scattered. The edges are sharp to prevent rounded surfaces which are normal at some point to the radar source. As any ray incident along the normal will reflect back along the normal, rounded surfaces make for a strong reflected signal.

From the side, a fighter aircraft will present a much larger area than the same aircraft viewed from the front. All other factors being equal, the aircraft will have a stronger signal from the side than from the front; hence the orientation of the target relative to the radar station is important.

=== Smooth surfaces ===
The relief of a surface could contain indentations that act as corner reflectors which would increase RCS from many orientations. This could arise from open bomb-bays, engine intakes, ordnance pylons, joints between constructed sections, etc. Also, it can be impractical to coat these surfaces with radar-absorbent materials.

==Measurement==
The size of a target&#x27;s image on radar is measured by the radar cross section or RCS, often represented by the symbol σ and expressed in square meters. This does not equal geometric area. A perfectly conducting sphere of projected cross sectional area 1 m2 (i.e. a diameter of 1.13 m) will have an RCS of 1 m2. For radar wavelengths much less than the diameter of the sphere, RCS is independent of frequency. Conversely, a square flat plate of area 1 m2 will have an RCS of σ = 4π &quot;A&quot;2 / &quot;λ&quot;2 (where &quot;A&quot;=area, &quot;λ&quot;=wavelength), or 139.62 m2 at 1 GHz if the radar is perpendicular to the flat surface. At off-normal incident angles, energy is reflected away from the receiver, reducing the RCS. Modern stealth aircraft are said to have an RCS comparable with small birds or large insects, though this varies widely depending on aircraft and radar.

If the RCS was directly related to the target&#x27;s cross-sectional area, the only way to reduce it would be to make the physical profile smaller. Rather, by reflecting much of the radiation away or by absorbing it, the target achieves a smaller radar cross section.

Measurement of a target&#x27;s RCS is performed at a radar reflectivity range or scattering range. The first type of range is an outdoor range where the target is positioned on a specially shaped low RCS pylon some distance down-range from the transmitters. Such a range eliminates the need for placing radar absorbers behind the target, however multi-path interactions with the ground must be mitigated.

An anechoic chamber is also commonly used. In such a room, the target is placed on a rotating pillar in the center, and the walls, floors and ceiling are covered by stacks of radar absorbing material. These absorbers prevent corruption of the measurement due to reflections. A compact range is an anechoic chamber with a reflector to simulate far field conditions.

Typical values for a centimeter wave radar are:

* Insect: 0.00001 m2
* Bird: 0.01 m2
* Stealth aircraft: &lt;0.1 m2 (e.g. F-117A: 0.001 m2)
* Surface-to-air-missile: ≈0.1 m2 
* Human: 1 m2
* small combat aircraft: 2–3 m2
* large combat aircraft: 5–6 m2
* Cargo aircraft: up to 100 m2
* Coastal trading vessel (55 m length): 300–4000 m2
* Corner reflector with 1.5 m edge length: ≈20,000 m2
* Frigate (103 m length): 5000–100,000 m2
* Container ship (212 m length): 10,000–80,000 m2

==Calculation==
Quantitatively, RCS is calculated in three-dimensions as

:formula_16

Where formula_6 is the RCS, formula_18 is the incident power density measured at the target, and formula_19 is the scattered power density seen at a distance formula_5 away from the target.

In electromagnetic analysis this is also commonly written as

:formula_21

where formula_22 and formula_23 are the far field scattered and incident electric field intensities, respectively.

In the design phase, it is often desirable to employ a computer to predict what the RCS will look like before fabricating an actual object. Many iterations of this prediction process can be performed in a short time at low cost, whereas use of a measurement range is often time-consuming, expensive and error-prone.
The linearity of Maxwell&#x27;s equations makes RCS relatively straightforward to calculate with a variety of analytic and numerical methods, but changing levels of military interest and the need for secrecy have made the field challenging, nonetheless.

The field of solving Maxwell&#x27;s equations through numerical algorithms is called computational electromagnetics, and many effective analysis methods have been applied to the RCS prediction problem.
RCS prediction software are often run on large supercomputers and employ high-resolution CAD models of real radar targets.

High frequency approximations such as geometric optics, physical optics, the geometric theory of diffraction, the uniform theory of diffraction and the physical theory of diffraction are used when the wavelength is much shorter than the target feature size.

Statistical models include chi-square, Rice, and the log-normal target models. These models are used to predict likely values of the RCS given an average value, and are useful when running radar Monte Carlo simulations.

Purely numerical methods such as the boundary element method (method of moments), finite difference time domain method (FDTD) and finite element methods are limited by computer performance to longer wavelengths or smaller features.

Though, for simple cases, the wavelength ranges of these two types of method overlap considerably, for difficult shapes and materials or very high accuracy they are combined in various sorts of hybrid method.

==Reduction==


RCS reduction is chiefly important in stealth technology for aircraft, missiles, ships, and other military vehicles. With smaller RCS, vehicles can better evade radar detection, whether it be from land-based installations, guided weapons or other vehicles. Reduced signature design also improves platforms&#x27; overall survivability through the improved effectiveness of its radar counter-measures.

Several methods exist. The distance at which a target can be detected for a given radar configuration varies with the fourth root of its RCS. Therefore, in order to cut the detection distance to one tenth, the RCS should be reduced by a factor of 10,000. While this degree of improvement is challenging, it is often possible when influencing platforms during the concept/design stage and using experts and advanced computer code simulations to implement the control options described below.

===Purpose shaping===
With purpose shaping, the shape of the target&#x27;s reflecting surfaces is designed such that they reflect energy away from the source. The aim is usually to create a “cone-of-silence” about the target&#x27;s direction of motion. Due to the energy reflection, this method is defeated by using passive (multistatic) radars.

Purpose-shaping can be seen in the design of surface faceting on the F-117A Nighthawk stealth attack aircraft. This aircraft, designed in the late 1970s though only revealed to the public in 1988, uses a multitude of flat surfaces to reflect incident radar energy away from the source. Yue suggests that limited available computing power for the design phase kept the number of surfaces to a minimum. The B-2 Spirit stealth bomber benefited from increased computing power, enabling its contoured shapes and further reduction in RCS. The F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II continue the trend in purpose shaping and promise to have even smaller monostatic RCS.

===Redirecting scattered energy without shaping===
This technique is relatively new compared to other techniques chiefly after the invention of metasurfaces. As mentioned earlier, the primary objective in geometry alteration is to redirect scattered waves away from the backscattered direction (or the source). However, it may compromise performance in terms of aerodynamics. One feasible solution, which has extensively been explored in recent time, is to utilize metasurfaces which can redirect scattered waves without altering the geometry of the target. Such metasurfaces can primarily be classified in two categories: (i) Checkerboard metasurfaces, (ii) Gradient index metasurfaces.

===Active cancellation===
With active cancellation, the target generates a radar signal equal in intensity but opposite in phase to the predicted reflection of an incident radar signal (similarly to noise canceling ear phones). This creates destructive interference between the reflected and generated signals, resulting in reduced RCS. To incorporate active cancellation techniques, the precise characteristics of the waveform and angle of arrival of the illuminating radar signal must be known, since they define the nature of generated energy required for cancellation. Except against simple or low frequency radar systems, the implementation of active cancellation techniques is extremely difficult due to the complex processing requirements and the difficulty of predicting the exact nature of the reflected radar signal over a broad aspect of an aircraft, missile or other target.

===Radar absorbent material===

Radar absorbent material (RAM) can be used in the original construction, or as an addition to highly reflective surfaces. There are at least three types of RAM: resonant, non-resonant magnetic and non-resonant large volume. 
*Resonant but somewhat &#x27;lossy&#x27; materials are applied to the reflecting surfaces of the target. The thickness of the material corresponds to one-quarter wavelength of the expected illuminating radar-wave (a Salisbury screen). The incident radar energy is reflected from the outside and inside surfaces of the RAM to create a destructive wave interference pattern. This results in the cancellation of the reflected energy. Deviation from the expected frequency will cause losses in radar absorption, so this type of RAM is only useful against radar with a single, common, and unchanging frequency.
*Non-resonant magnetic RAM uses ferrite particles suspended in epoxy or paint to reduce the reflectivity of the surface to incident radar waves. Because the non-resonant RAM dissipates incident radar energy over a larger surface area, it usually results in a trivial increase in surface temperature, thus reducing RCS without an increase in infrared signature. A major advantage of non-resonant RAM is that it can be effective over a wide range of frequencies, whereas resonant RAM is limited to a narrow range of design frequencies.
*Large volume RAM is usually resistive carbon loading added to fiberglass hexagonal cell aircraft structures or other non-conducting components. Fins of resistive materials can also be added. Thin resistive sheets spaced by foam or aerogel may be suitable for spacecraft.

Thin coatings made of only dielectrics and conductors have very limited absorbing bandwidth, so magnetic materials are used when weight and cost permit, either in resonant RAM or as non-resonant RAM.

=== Optimization methods ===
Thin non-resonant or broad resonance coatings can be modeled with a Leontovich impedance boundary condition (see also Electrical impedance). This is the ratio of the tangential electric field to the tangential magnetic field on the surface, and ignores fields propagating along the surface within the coating. This is particularly convenient when using boundary element method calculations. The surface impedance can be calculated and tested separately.
For an isotropic surface the ideal surface impedance is equal to the 377 ohm impedance of free space.
For non-isotropic (anisotropic) coatings, the optimal coating depends on the shape of the target and the radar direction, but duality, the symmetry of Maxwell&#x27;s equations between the electric and magnetic fields, tells one that optimal coatings have η0 × η1 = 3772 Ω2, where η0 and η1 are perpendicular components of the anisotropic surface impedance, aligned with edges and/or the radar direction.

A perfect electric conductor has more back scatter from a leading edge for the linear polarization with the electric field parallel to the edge and more from a trailing edge with the electric field perpendicular to the edge, so the high surface impedance should be parallel to leading edges and perpendicular to trailing edges, for the greatest radar threat direction, with some sort of smooth transition between.

To calculate the radar cross-section of such a stealth body, one would typically do one-dimensional reflection calculations to calculate the surface impedance, then two dimensional numerical calculations to calculate the diffraction coefficients of edges and small three dimensional calculations to calculate the diffraction coefficients of corners and points. The cross section can then be calculated, using the diffraction coefficients, with the physical theory of diffraction or other high frequency method, combined with physical optics to include the contributions from illuminated smooth surfaces and Fock calculations to calculate creeping waves circling around any smooth shadowed parts.

Optimization is in the reverse order. First one does high frequency calculations to optimize the shape and find the most important features, then small calculations to find the best surface impedances in the problem areas, then reflection calculations to design coatings. Large numerical calculations can run too slowly for numerical optimization or can distract workers from the physics, even when massive computing power is available.

==RCS of an antenna==
For the case of an antenna the total RCS can be divided into two separate components as Structural Mode RCS and Antenna Mode RCS. The two components of the RCS relates to the two scattering phenomena that takes place at the antenna. When an electromagnetic signal falls on an antenna surface, some part of the electromagnetic energy is scattered back to the space. This is called structural mode scattering. The remaining part of the energy is absorbed due to the antenna effect. Some part of the absorbed energy is again scattered back into the space due to the impedance mismatches, called antenna mode scattering.

==Bistatic RCS==
For the bistatic radar configuration—transmitter and receiver separated (not co-located) -- the bistatic radar cross-section (BRCS) is a function of both the transmitter-target orientation and the receiver-target orientation.
A normalized bistatic radar cross-section (NBRCS) or bistatic normalized radar cross-section (BNRCS) may also be defined, similar to the monostatic NRCS.

<doc id="740685" wikidata="Q7885034" url="?curid=740685" title="Uniform Determination of Death Act">
<text>The Uniform Determination of Death Act (UDDA) is a model state law that was approved for the United States in 1981 by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, in cooperation with the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and the President&#x27;s Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research. The act has since been adopted by most US states and is intended &quot;to provide a comprehensive and medically sound basis for determining death in all situations&quot;. Brain death is a different condition than persistent vegetative state. Due to better seat belt use, bicycle helmets, and the general decrease in violent crime, there are lower numbers of brain deaths now than historically. Donation after cardiac death (DCD) is a new protocol applied when there is severe neurologic injury but the patient does not meet the criteria for brain death.

The three sections of the Act proposed for enactment read as follows.

== Section 1 ==
Determination of Death. An individual who has sustained either (1) irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions, or (2) irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem, is dead. A determination of death must be made in accordance with accepted medical standards.

== Section 2 ==
Uniformity of Construction and Application. This Act shall be applied and construed to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law with respect to the subject of this Act among states enacting it.

== Enactments ==
 the act has been adopted by 37 states, plus D.C. and the Virgin Islands: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, District of Columbia, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, U.S. Virgin Islands, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

==Revision==
 the Uniform Death Act is under revision by the Uniform Law Commission, with a draft expected to be completed by 2023.

<text>Aster Aweke (; born 1959) is an Ethiopian singer-songwriter. Aster&#x27;s voice has attracted broader public popularity, especially tracing back in 1990s singles and her single &quot;Abebayehosh&quot; in Ethiopian New Year. She is best known for her 1999 album &quot;Hagere&quot; and her 2006 album &quot;Fikir&quot;. She moved to the United States in 1981, and she returned to Ethiopia in 1997.

==Early life==
Aster Aweke was born in Gondar in 1959. She moved to Addis Ababa as a child with her father, who was senior civil servant in the imperial government of Haile Selassie. Aster hails from the Gurage ethnic group. 
In a 1990 interview with Amy Duncan of The Christian Science Monitor, Aster discussed how her parents disproved of her musical ambition: My family opposed me, but I just kept going and going... That&#x27;s my life. I tried everything, but music makes me so happy.&quot;

==Career==
Aster enjoyed listening to Ethiopian musicians like Tilahun Gessesse and Bizunesh Bekele, as well as American musicians like Donna Summer and Aretha Franklin. When she was thirteen years-old, she decided to join Hager Fikir Theatre and auditioned by singing Bizunesh&#x27;s song to join the theater as a dancer and vocalist.

In her teen years, she performed through clubs at Addis Ababa with famous bands including Shebelle Band, Roha Band, Ibex Band and Hotel D&#x27;Afrique Band. Her style gradually influenced by Bizunesh Bekele and performed songs by Donna Summer and Aretha Franklin. She began as a solo career in 1977 through the release of her debut album, and followed with three more albums within the year.

In 1981, she moved to the United States. She temporarily settled in the San Francisco Bay Area of California and then within two years moved to Washington, D.C. She briefly attended Northern Virginia Community College, specializing in computer science, as well as learning formal musical education, which she took a distaste towards. During her time in the D.C. metropolitan area, she performed in restaurants and clubs. During her time in Washington, Aster released her U.S. major label debut &quot;Aster&quot;. &quot;Aster&quot; was released by Columbia Records in 1990 after a 1989 release by British independent label Triple Earth.

In 1997, after more than 15 years abroad, Aster returned to Ethiopia, where she was warmly welcomed by thousands of fans awaiting her at Addis Ababa airport.

Aster Aweke owned and operated a cafeteria in Addis Ababa called Kabu, which was named after her song &quot;Kabu&quot;. The cafeteria ceased operations in 2015. On 3 January 2023, Aster released &quot;Soba&quot;. The album comprises a collabrative work of other artists.

<text>European Parliament elections were held in France on 13 June 2004. The opposition Socialist Party made substantial gains, although this was mainly at the expense of minor parties. The governing Union for a Popular Movement and Union for French Democracy also made gains.

==Seats==
The elections were conducted in seven regional constituencies in metropolitan France, plus an eighth consisting of all overseas departments and territories. Allocation of seats was by proportional representation, with closed lists and no preferential voting, using the rule of the highest average, with a threshold of 5% of the votes in each.

<text>Mindaribba railway station is located on the North Coast line in New South Wales, Australia. Originally a full-length platform, it was later replaced by the present short platform. It serves the rural locality of Mindaribba. It is served by NSW TrainLink Hunter line services travelling between Newcastle and Dungog.

The station opened in August 1911 as Dunmore and was renamed Mindaribba the following year.

==Platforms and services==
Mindaribba consists of a single wooden platform about three metres long. It is served by NSW TrainLink Hunter line services travelling between Newcastle and Dungog. There are five Dungog services and four Newcastle services on weekdays, with three services in each direction on weekends and public holidays. It is a request stop with passengers required to notify the guard if they wish to alight. The platform is so small that it has attracted some media attention.

Opposite the platform is a 1,562 metre crossing loop.

<doc id="740699" wikidata="Q2556757" url="?curid=740699" title="Bandar-log">
<text>Bandar-log () is a term used in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1894) to describe the monkeys of the Seeonee jungle.

==Description==
In Hindi, &quot;Bandar&quot; means &quot;monkey&quot; and &quot;log&quot; means &quot;people&quot; – hence the term simply refers to &quot;monkey people&quot;. The term has also since come to refer to &quot;any body of irresponsible chatterers&quot;.

==History==
The Bandar-log feature most prominently in the story &quot;Kaa&#x27;s Hunting&quot;, where their scatterbrained anarchy causes them to be treated as pariahs by the rest of the jungle. Their foolish and chattering ways are illustrated by their slogan: &quot;We are great. We are free. We are wonderful. We are the most wonderful people in all the jungle! We all say so, and so it must be true&quot;. Bandar-log communicate almost entirely through the repetition of other animals&#x27; speech.

The &quot;Road-Song of the Bandar-log&quot; is a companion poem to &#x27;Kaa&#x27;s Hunting&#x27;, and demonstrates Kipling&#x27;s strong adherence to poetic form.

==In other media==
* The Bandar-log appear in Disney&#x27;s animated film &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, where they are portrayed as having moptop hairstyles and prehensile tails, the latter being a feature which is non-existent in Old World monkeys. It is stated repeatedly in the Kipling story that the Bandar-log &quot;have no king&quot;, but the Disney film version gave them one: King Louie. He is an orangutan, but in reality, orangutans are not found in India. The Bandar-log capture Mowgli and take him to Louie. They participate in the &quot;I Wan&#x27;na Be Like You&quot; musical number, during which Baloo and Bagheera attempt to free Mowgli from Louie who tries to get Mowgli to divulge the secrets to the &quot;red flower&quot; (a name given to fire).
** Some of the monkeys are also included in the television series &quot;TaleSpin&quot;, as employees of Louie&#x27;s Island-Bar.
** The Bandar-log reappear in &quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot;, this time without their leader Louie who was mentioned to have left the jungle. They are just seen dancing with Baloo, Mowgli, and other animals during the song &quot;W-I-L-D&quot;.
* In &quot;Jungle Book Shonen Mowgli&quot;, Louis/Alba and his monkey army are clearly based on the Bandar-log although they are not referred to as such. They also have an alliance with Shere Khan, with Louis/Alba being an informant, but also fear him. After they destroyed Mowgli&#x27;s hut, they were persuaded to cast off their alliance, which they do, and later act as an independent gang.
* The Bandar-Log also appear in the Soviet series &quot;Adventures of Mowgli&quot;. Like in the literature and aforementioned portrayals, they kidnap Mowgli and bring him to their city. They are later defeated by Kaa&#x27;s hypnotic dancing.
* In the 1994 live-action Disney film, the Bandar-log appear more as mischievous treasure thieves associated with King Louie (an orangutan again), who inhabit an ancient lost city. Their vocal effects are provided by using sounds of chimpanzees and siamangs. After a monkey steals Mowgli&#x27;s bracelet, Mowgli follows him to the city. Inside the treasure room, the Bandar-log gather with their &quot;king&quot;, King Louie, who is wearing King Louis XIV&#x27;s crown. Louie summons his guardian Kaa to kill Mowgli, but Mowgli subdues the snake and Louie returns the bracelet to him. Later on, Mowgli and Captain Boone engage in a sword fight in the treasure room, watched by Louie and the monkeys. Mowgli injures Boone and flees, while Boone stays to pocket treasure before he is killed by Kaa.
* The Bandar-Log appear in the 1998 live-action direct to video Disney film &quot;The Jungle Book: Mowgli&#x27;s Story&quot; where they live in Monkey Town and secretly work for Shere Khan. This group of monkeys consist of chimpanzees and baboons (neither of which are native to India). In the film, they kidnap Mowgli and take him to their Monkey Town, but Baloo and Bagheera manage to rescue him and escape from them.
* The Bandar-Log appear in the 2010 TV series. They are led by a female langur named Masha, who is their queen.
* In the 2016 film, the Bandar-log are portrayed as various species of Indian primates (namely lion-tailed macaques, northern pig-tailed macaques, langurs, and Hoolock gibbons that resemble northern white-cheeked gibbons) rather than all being the same species of monkey. They again kidnap Mowgli and present him to their leader King Louie, who is a &quot;Gigantopithecus&quot; in this version, in order to learn the secret of the &quot;red flower&quot;. As in the 1994 film, they do not speak, with the exception of Louie. Their vocal effects were created by using sounds of chimpanzees and gibbons in addition to uncredited voice actors. When King Louie gets buried beneath the rubble of his lair, the Bandar-log work to dig him out.
* The Bandar-Log are seen in &quot;&quot;. Like in the anime, they are in league with Shere Khan. The Bandar-log kidnap Mowgli following his hunting exercise on Tabaqui&#x27;s command so Shere Khan could kill him, but are thwarted by Bagheera, Baloo, and Kaa.
* Charles Koechlin wrote a symphonic poem &quot;Les Bandar-Log&quot; (1939-40), part of a &quot;Jungle Book Cycle&quot;.
* In &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;, Zora Neale Hurston refers to the gossips and storytellers on the porch of Joe Starks&#x27; store as the bander log (Hurston&#x27;s spelling). The novel&#x27;s protagonist, Janie, passes the store on her way back into town after a long absence. In her autobiography, &quot;Dust Tracks on the Road&quot;, Hurston mentions Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Jungle Book&quot; as among her favorite to read as a child, saying, &quot;I loved his talking snakes as much as I did the hero&quot;.

<text>Translations is a three-act play by Irish playwright Brian Friel, written in 1980. It is set in Baile Beag (Ballybeg), a County Donegal village in 19th-century Ireland. Friel has said that &quot;Translations&quot; is &quot;a play about language and only about language&quot;, but it deals with a wide range of issues, stretching from language and communication to Irish history and cultural imperialism. Friel said that his play &quot;should have been written in Irish&quot; but, despite this fact, he carefully crafted the verbal action in English, bringing the political questions of the play into focus. Baile Beag (&quot;Small Town&quot;) is a fictional village, created by Friel as a setting for several of his plays, although there are many real places called Ballybeg throughout Ireland.

==Performance and publication==
&quot;Translations&quot; was first performed at the Guildhall, Derry, Northern Ireland, on Tuesday, 23 September 1980. It was the first production by the Field Day Theatre Company founded by Friel and Stephen Rea. It was directed by Art Ó Briain and featured the following cast:

* Mick Lally (Manus)
* Ann Hasson (Sarah)
* Roy Hanlon (Jimmy Jack)
* Nuala Hayes (Máire)
* Liam Neeson (Doalty)
* Brenda Scallon (Bridget)
* Ray McAnally (Hugh)
* Stephen Rea (Owen)
* David Heap (Captain Lancey)
* Shaun Scott (Lieutenant Yolland)

The staging in Derry was significant for a number reasons. Friel and Stephen Rea thought of Derry as a clean slate where they could have more creative control over their work. Rea also thought that the play had a much profounder impact being staged in Derry than if it had been staged in Dublin. Art Ó Briain also pushed for a Derry staging. Furthermore, Guildhall&#x27;s proximity to the play&#x27;s County Donegal setting and the strong Northern accents of the mostly Ulster cast created a strong sense of &quot;local pride&quot; and &quot;community passion&quot;. Derry itself was also the subject of a name dispute, fitting for a play &quot;concerned with place names&quot;.

&quot;Translations&quot; received its American premiere at Cleveland Play House in 1981, starring Richard Halverson as Hugh. The production was directed by Kenneth Albers with scene and lighting design by Richard Gould. The play was staged in New York City later that year by the Manhattan Theatre Club, starring Barnard Hughes. It was briefly revived on Broadway in 1995 in a production starring Brian Dennehy. In 2006–2007, the Manhattan Theatre Club returned it to the stage at the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, New Jersey and the Biltmore Theatre in New York, directed by Garry Hynes.

The play was published in 1981 by Faber and Faber, who still publish it today. It is published in the United States and performance rights are held by Samuel French Inc. It is a set text on the Leaving Certificate English curriculum in Ireland and, in the United Kingdom, it remains a popular set text among English and Drama &amp; Theatre A-Level students. It won the Christopher Ewart-Biggs Memorial Prize for 1985.

An Irish-language version of the play has been produced. The play has also been translated into Welsh by Elan Closs Stephens. The Welsh version has visited a number of venues in Wales and was first published by Gwasg Carreg Gwalch, under its Welsh title &quot;Torri Gair&quot; (&quot;Breaking the Word&quot;), in 1982.

The play was staged in 2003 in Greece by &quot;Aplo Theatre&quot; directed by Antonis Antypas. One of the last performances was attended by the author himself. According to Kathimerini newspaper, &quot;the photos of the Athenian performance that arrived at his home in Donegal made him decide to make the not easy journey. The physiognomies of the actors played a decisive role&quot;.

&quot;Translations&quot; was adapted for Belarus in 2009 by Mykalai Pinygin at Janka Kupala Theater. Irish characters speak Belarusian in the play, and the English speak Russian, which draws parallels with the period of russification of Belarus by Imperial Russia in 19th-20th century. 

&quot;Translations&quot; was adapted as a radio play directed by Kirsty Williams, broadcast on BBC Radio 4, on 4 September 2010 (see &quot;Translations (radio play)&quot;).

&quot;Translations&quot; was adapted for a Catalan audience in February, 2014 by Ferran Utzet, and performed at the Biblioteca de Catalunya (Library of Catalonia) in Barcelona. It was produced by Perla 29.

In 2017 &quot;Translations&quot; were directed by Bill Kerr at University of Manitoba’s Black Hole Theatre Company.

&quot;Translations&quot; were performed at the Olivier Theatre from 22 May to 11 August 2018, starring Colin Morgan as Owen and Ciarán Hinds as his father. It was directed by Ian Rickson.

In 2022 &quot;Translations&quot; was translated into te reo Māori by Hēmi Kelly, a full-time lecturer in te reo Māori at the Auckland University of Technology. It was commissioned by the Embassy of Ireland in Aotearoa New Zealand and is the first major Irish literary work available in the language. 

&quot;Translations&quot; premiered in Ukraine amidst the Russian invasion of 2022. Kyrylo Kashlikov directed it at Lesya Ukrainka Theater and in 2023 the play toured in Dublin&#x27;s Abbey Theater in Ukrainian with English subtitles. 

=== Inspirations and influences ===
Five years prior to writing &quot;Translations&quot;, Friel mentioned a number of topics going through his mind: a play set sometime between the Act of Union and the Great Famine in the 19th century; a play about Daniel O&#x27;Connell and the Catholic Emancipation; a play about colonialism; and a play about the death of the Irish language, the acquisition of English and its profound effects. During this time, Friel had made a couple of accidental discoveries: that his great-great-grandfather was a hedge-schoolmaster, leading Friel to read about hedge-schools in Ireland; and that the first trigonometrical base set up by the Ordnance Survey in 1828 was next to his residence in Muff, leading him to read about the man in charge of the survey, Colonel Thomas Frederick Colby, who would later serve as inspiration for one of &quot;Translation&#x27;s&quot; characters, Captain Lancey. Friel then discovered &quot;A Paper Landscape&quot; in 1976, which synthesized everything he had been thinking about into the perfect metaphor, map-making, serving as the foundation for his work.

&quot;A Paper Landscape&quot; was written by John Hardwood Andrews and first published in 1975 by Oxford University Press. It examines the Ordnance Survey&#x27;s map-making operation in Ireland which began in 1824, with the first maps appearing between 1835 and 1846, and production continuing until almost the end of the century.

&quot;Friel&#x27;s reading of George Steiner&#x27;s &quot;After Babel&quot; was absolutely essential to the creation of &quot;Translations.&quot;&quot;

== Characters ==

* Manus - a scholar who is his late twenties/thirties who is one of Hugh&#x27;s sons and lame. Hugh treats Manus badly, never paying him, acknowledging his hard work and treating him like a &#x27;footman&#x27;, despite this Manus respects and refuses to go against his father. He speaks only Irish in front of the British, even though he knows how to speak English. He tries to teach Sarah how to speak. Manus has difficulty walking due to an injury sustained from his father when he was a baby.
* Sarah - she has had a speech defect all her life, leading many in the town to consider her dumb.
* Jimmy Jack Cassie - the &quot;infant prodigy&quot; is a bachelor in his sixties, who never washes or changes his clothes. Despite being fluent in both Latin and Greek, he still enjoys attending the hedge-school. He is obsessed with the Greek Goddess Athena, and the line between reality and fiction blurs for him throughout the play.
* Máire - a strong woman in her twenties, she wants to learn English so that she can emigrate to America.
* Doalty - a young man described as &#x27;generous and slightly thick&#x27; with his idiocy mocked by characters such as Hugh. However, Doalty is implied to be smarter than he seems, and is involved in the Irish resistance with connections to the Donnelly Twins. He studies at the local hedge-school.
* Bridget - a young girl with &quot;a countrywoman&#x27;s instinctive cunning&quot;. She has a close, implied romantic, relationship with Doalty. She studies at the local hedge-school.
* Hugh - a large man in his late sixties, perpetually drunk. He is hedge-master at Baile Beag&#x27;s hedge-school, often quizzing his students on the origins of words.
* Owen - a well dressed, handsome young man in his twenties, who is also one of Hugh&#x27;s sons. He is employed part-time by the British to provide English translations of place names in Ireland. The British mistakenly call him Roland.
* Captain Lancey - a middle-aged officer, competent at cartography but lacking in social skills.
* Lieutenant Yolland - in his late twenties/early thirties, with a tall awkward appearance. He is in Ireland by chance. Having missed his boat to India, he subsequently enlisted in the Army, was assigned to the Engineers, then posted to Dublin, and finally sent to Baile Beag with the Ordnance Survey. He often proclaims his admiration for the Irish culture and language despite being unable to speak it. He falls in love with Maire.
* Donnelly Twins - they are referred to several times throughout the play, but are never shown on-stage.

==Plot==

The play is set in the quiet community of Baile Beag (later anglicised to Ballybeg), in County Donegal, in 1833. Many of the inhabitants have little experience of the world outside the village. In spite of this, tales about Greek goddesses are as commonplace as those about the potato crops, and, in addition to Irish, Latin and Greek are spoken in the local hedge school. Friel uses language as a tool to highlight the problems of communication — lingual, cultural, and generational. Both Irish and English characters in the play &quot;speak&quot; their respective languages, but in actuality it is English that is mostly spoken by the actors. This allows the audience to understand all the languages, as if a translator was provided. However, onstage, the characters cannot comprehend each other. This is due to lack of compromise from both parties, the English and Irish, to learn the others&#x27; language, a metaphor for the wider barrier that is between the two parties.

=== Act 1 ===
The play opens with a Hedge School in Baile Beag, it is supposedly run by the alcoholic schoolmaster Hugh, although his lame aspiring teacher son Manus does most of the work, and is mistreated by his father despite this. Manus helps Sarah, who the village consider dumb due to her speech impediment, and is oblivious to her feelings for him. Students begin to arrive including Manus&#x27; partner, Máire, who is currently upset with Manus due to his inability to stand up to Hugh and plans to learn English and leave for America.

The action begins when Owen (mistakenly pronounced as Roland by his English friend), the younger (and favorite) son of Hugh who consequently has a strained relationship with Manus, returning home after six years away in Dublin. With him are Captain Lancey, a middle-aged, pragmatic cartographer, and Lieutenant Yolland, a young, idealistic and romantic orthographer, both working on the six-inch-to-the-mile map survey of Ireland for the Ordnance Survey. Owen acts as a translator and go-between for the British and Irish, as only he, Manus, and Hugh speak both languages. The characters all have differing opinions on Owen&#x27;s indifference to the anglicising program he is helping Lancey and Yolland with.

=== Act 2 ===
Yolland and Owen work to translate local placenames into English for purposes of the map: &quot;Druim Dubh&quot;, which means &quot;black shoulder&quot; in Irish, becomes Dromduff in English, and &quot;Poll na gCaorach&quot;, meaning &quot;hole of the sheep&quot; in Irish, becomes Poolkerry. While Owen has no qualms about anglicising the names of places that form part of his heritage, Yolland, who has fallen in love with Ireland, is unhappy with what he perceives as a destruction of Irish culture and language. Manus and Hugh, who both separately interrupt the pair, also have differing opinions; Manus dislikes Yolland who he views as ignorant about Irish culture, whereas Hugh makes himself seem pompous in attempts to impress the English soldier. Soon after Hugh leaves, Owen becomes angry with Yolland&#x27;s consistent mispronunciations and calling him &#x27;Roland&#x27; causing him to correct him for the first time.

Manus successfully applies for a teaching job on the island of Inis Meadhon, and assumes Máire will join him. Máire, meanwhile, begins a friendly correspondence with Yolland despite that fact he only speaks English and she only speaks Irish. Although initially Owen translates for them, they later meet and leave a party together, where they manage to communicate without a translator. Sarah witnesses the pair kiss, and flees to tell Manus.

=== Act 3 ===
The following day, Manus prepares to flee Baile Beag to Inis Meadhon against Owen&#x27;s desperate advice. It is revealed that Yolland has gone missing overnight after a confrontation with Manus (it is hinted that he has been attacked, or worse, by the elusive armed resistance in the form of the Donnelly twins), and Owen believes Lancey and the men will blame Manus. Despite this, a distraught Manus leaves, and it is suggested that he will be killed as he is lame and thus will be caught by the soldiers. 

The students arrive, bringing stories of the masses of English soldiers searching for Yolland and those responsible for his disappearance. Máire is in denial about Yolland&#x27;s disappearance and remains convinced that he will return unharmed. Yolland&#x27;s unit, forming a search party, rampage across Baile Beag, and Captain Lancey arrives at the school, threatening first to shoot all livestock if Yolland is not found within twenty-four hours, then evict the villagers and destroy their homes if he is not found within forty-eight hours. Owen then realizes what he should do and leaves, seemingly to join the resistance. The play ends ambiguously, with the schoolmaster Hugh drunkenly reciting the opening of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, which tells of the inevitability of conquest but also of its impermanence.

Friel&#x27;s play tells of the struggle between England and Ireland during this turbulent time. The play focuses mainly on (mis)communication and language to tell of the desperate situation between these two countries with an unsure and questionable outcome.

== Themes ==

=== Politics ===
&quot;Translations&quot; as a play focuses primarily on language issues through the lens of 19th century rural Ireland. However through the choice of setting, Friel reveals his attempt to maintain an ideological distance from the ongoing Northern Irish Troubles and the era&#x27;s extremely divisive political climate. As Friel said of the process of dislocating &quot;Translations&quot; from the political context of the late 70&#x27;s and early 80&#x27;s, &quot;I know of no Irish writer who is not passionately engaged in our current problems. But he must maintain perspective as a writer, and - equally important - he will write about the situation in terms that may not relate even remotely to the squalor of Here and Now.&quot;

Friel saw &quot;Translations&quot;, in his own words as, &quot;...Stepping stones to the other side.&quot; In light of these quotations, &quot;Translations&quot; emerges as an attempt by Friel to reconcile the divided state of Northern Ireland. This goal was the explicit driving force behind the first production of &quot;Translations&quot;. &quot;Translations&quot; premiered on 23 September 1980, in Derry&#x27;s Guildhall, a symbol of Unionism in the politically divided city, the staging of the play there being an overt political message of reconciliation attempted by Friel.

Within &quot;Translations&quot;, the relationship between the British officer Yolland and Máire the native Irish speaker, points to the binary of political belief in Northern Ireland between Unionists and Republicans. The couple, who cannot speak one another&#x27;s language, nevertheless fall in love, a potent message of reconciliation and co-existence to the politically divided communities of Northern Ireland. Friel marked &quot;Translations&quot; as trying to, &quot;...find some kind of generosity that can embrace the whole island.&quot;

=== Post-Colonialism ===
The engagement of postcolonial scholars with &quot;Translations&quot; arises primarily through an examination of the language issues of 19th century Ireland. As Friel himself has emphasised, &quot;Translations&quot; is about &quot;language and only language.&quot; However, the Irish language has often been interpreted not only as a mean of communication, but also as &quot;a tool for resistance and a marker of identity&quot;. Language affects many aspects of one&#x27;s life, and Translations shows &quot;the power of language to give definition not only to thought, but also to history, ethnic identity and national aspiration&quot;.

Friel&#x27;s often quoted denial of the other themes in &quot;Translations&quot;, is directly at odds with other statements, &quot;Of course, it&#x27;s also concerned with the English presence here. No matter how benign they may think it has been, finally the presence of any foreigner in your land is malign.&quot;

It has been suggested that Friel&#x27;s creation of &quot;Translations&quot; was inspired by two projects during the period of British rule in Ireland. Firstly, the abolition of independent &#x27;hedgerow&#x27; schools which taught subjects in the Irish language, replaced with English-language schools. The imposition of the new national school was, in part, an attempt by the Dublin Castle administration to replace Irish by English as the sole medium of instruction. This change of the educational system, similar to the translation of the place names on the map, has been called the &quot;rape of a country&#x27;s linguistic and cultural heritage&quot;. As the Irish scholar Declan Kiberd remarks, &quot;one of the first policies formulated by the Norman occupiers was to erase Gaelic culture&quot;. This historical context serves to demonstrate that the &quot;language of any country is seen as a matter of identity, independence and &#x27;sovereignty&#x27;&quot;. Secondly, the Ordnance Survey which sought to create standardisations of Irish maps, primarily through the Anglicisation of Irish place-names. Postcolonial scholar Shaun Richards argues that Friel uses these two historical events as the framing for his discussion of colonialism within &quot;Translations&quot;. As Frantz Fanon said, colonialism, &quot;...turns to the past of the oppressed people, and distorts, disfigures and destroys it.&quot; In this sense, Friel highlights the destructive nature of the colonial projects depicted in &quot;Translations&quot;, literally &#x27;distorting&#x27; the landscape of Ireland by the Anglicisation of place-names and replacing the use of native language with a foreign one.

The colonial projects depicted in &quot;Translations&quot; are used by Friel to discuss post-colonial tensions in modern Northern Ireland. Edward Said saw &quot;Translations&quot; as firmly within the post-colonial discourse, &quot;Brian Friel’s immensely resonant play &quot;Translations&quot;...immediately calls forth many echoes and parallels in an Indian, Algerian, or Palestinian reader...the silencing of their voices, the renaming of places and replacement of languages by the imperial outsider, the creation of colonial maps and divisions also implied the attempted reshaping of societies, the imposition of foreign languages and other forms of dispossession.&quot;

=== Language, identity and culture ===

a. For much of the play, it is understood that characters are speaking Irish, and the English characters cannot understand them. There are also several passages of Latin and Ancient Greek.
Though Translations is written almost completely in English (with odd lines of Greek and Latin), Friel intended that the &quot;English onstage represents two separate languages – the Irish we are asked to imagine and the English which is now the &#x27;natural vehicle&#x27; for a play on an Irish stage&quot;. &quot;Linguistic and cognitive distance&quot; are shown between characters from the different linguistic parties: the Irish and English characters have been given different voices even though their speech is written in the same language. Friel&#x27;s dramatic conceit allows the audience access to either side of the language barrier, making the misunderstandings and miscommunications between Yolland and Maire in the love scene evident.

The &quot;idioms and rhythms of Irish speech&quot; are depicted through Doalty, Bridget and Jimmy Jack Cassie&#x27;s speeches, in contrast with Lancey, who speaks in the &quot;clipped, efficient tones of the King&#x27;s English&quot;, to emphasise the other central theme of &quot;colonialism&quot;. The idea of a &#x27;doubleness&#x27; in response to the Irish-English language conflict is also represented in the play. Considered as &quot;a mid-solution of the Old Gaelic tongue and the modern &#x27;dominant&#x27; English&quot;, &#x27;doubleness&#x27; would require Ireland &quot;either to use an Irish version of English, which includes Gaelic expression, or to be a bi-lingual nation in which both Irish and English are acceptable&quot;. W. B. Spring Worthen has argued that in &quot;Translations&quot;, Friel presents the Irish English to its audience by &quot;trouble[ing] the &#x27;English&#x27; surfaces of the play, using Irish English in ways that keep its language &#x27;other&#x27; to audiences whose English isn&#x27;t Irish&quot;.

== Criticism and interpretations ==
&quot;Translations&quot; received a wide range of interpretations and reactions since its Derry staging. In spite of the irony of it being played in the Guildhall, &quot;a symbol of Unionist power&quot;, the Sinn Féin weekly &quot;An Phoblacht&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Translations&quot; deals powerfully with a number of themes of particular interest to Republicans&quot;, and yet the unionist Lord Mayor of Derry led a standing ovation on opening night.

Sean Connolly criticised the historical liberties taken in &quot;Translations&quot;, writing that Friel &quot;presents a grossly oversimplified view of the forces behind the abandonment of Irish.&quot;

The philosopher Richard Kearney argued that &quot;Translations&quot; presented language not as a naming system, but as a way to find new relationships between the &quot;sundered cultural identities of the island&quot;.

=== Historical inaccuracies ===
John H. Andrews challenged many of Friel&#x27;s representations of the Ordnance Survey, concerned that they be taken as historically plausible or true. For example, anglicised place names were already being used throughout Ireland, so it is &quot;dangerously ambiguous to describe what the Survey did as &#x27;naming&#x27;.&quot; Many of the names on the new maps were already widely being used in Ireland, and that there were no laws or obligations to use any of the Ordnance Survey names. As well, the soldiers going on survey duty were presented in the play as &quot;prodding every inch of ground with their bayonets&quot;, even though they historically would not have had bayonets. When Yolland, one of the Ordnance Survey officers, disappeared, Lancey threatened to retaliate by shooting live-stock and evicting people when in actuality, the soldiers would have left issues of crime and civil disturbance to the local constabulary. There were also inconsistencies in some of the dates. For example, Donegal had already been renamed by the time of the play in 1833, but was actually renamed in 1835, and the actual Yolland that Lieutenant Yolland is based on did not join the survey department until 1838.

Kevin Barry organized a debate in 1983 between Friel and Andrews, where Friel admits to &quot;tiny bruises inflicted on history in the play&quot;. Kevin Barry forgave the historical liberties that &quot;Translations&quot; makes, writing that it revealed the &#x27;hidden Ireland&#x27;, making use of the &#x27;unreality of fiction in order to imagine answers&#x27; to questions that even the English mapmakers had about the Irish people. Even though it is a work of fictional drama, this aspect of it makes the work complementary to &quot;A Paper Landscape,&quot; which privileged the records of those who had the authority to write, while excluding those who were defeated.

=== Owen ===
Owen is &quot;by far the most complex character onstage&quot;, embodying &#x27;all the conflicts and tensions in the play&#x27;. Owen arrives as an interpreter for the English in the Irish village, establishing himself as a pivotal cog in the social fabric of Baile Beag. He is comfortable being called interchangeably as Owen by the locals and Roland by the British, yet denies his heritage - &quot;my job is to translate the quaint, archaic tongue you people persist in speaking into the King&#x27;s good English&quot;. While claiming to be the &quot;same me&quot;; he is not - he is one part Irish and one part British, and acts as a crucial go-between, a role which he also denies, leading him to be less concerned with the social repercussions of his work. In the play, he is responsible for bringing together Maire and Yolland, but refuses to take responsibility for the effects of his actions; without Owen to fill the gap at the center, the union is doomed - just like Baile Beag and the English force. Owen&#x27;s role in the destruction of Baile Beag is alluded to by Hugh&#x27;s drunken recitation of the Aeneid near the end of the play. The lines refer to Carthage, the legendary North African settlement of Dido, and, in history, the notorious thorn in ancient Rome&#x27;s side that was finally sacked and conquered in the Third Punic War - by analogy the Romans are the British and the Carthaginians the Irish.

==Historical references==

* The Englishmen in the play are a detachment of the Royal Engineers and function as part of the Ordnance Survey creating six inch maps of Ireland. The characters of Captain Lancey and Lieutenant Yolland are fictionalised representations of two real soldiers who took part in the survey: Thomas Frederick Colby and William Yolland, but Thomas Larcom has also been identified as a possible model for the lieutenant, with Owen based on his teacher, the Irish linguist John O&#x27;Donovan.

* The character Máire contemplates emigration to America, reflecting the mass emigration of Irish people to America in the 19th century. The theme of emigration is key throughout the whole play, as Manus plans to leave after being offered a job in another hedge school.
* There are fearful references to potato blight, anticipating the Great Famine of 1845–49 (the play is set in 1833).
* Irish politician and nationalist hero Daniel O&#x27;Connell is mentioned and quoted as saying that Irish people should learn English and that the Irish language was a barrier to modern progress.
*Anglicisation of place names, including Baile Beag (the setting), is prominent in the dialogue, because it is Lieutenant Yolland&#x27;s professional assignment.
* A national school is to open in the town, replacing the existing hedge school.
* Characters Hugh and Jimmy remember how they marched to battle during the Irish Rebellion of 1798, only to march back home upon feeling homesick.
* The play&#x27;s focus on the Anglicization of names of the Irish towns and cities is based on the Ordnance Survey during 1824–46, which was intended for more efficient work in tax regulations and military planning.

<text>The Oxford Book of English Verse, 1250–1900 is an anthology of English poetry, edited by Arthur Quiller-Couch, that had a very substantial influence on popular taste and perception of poetry for at least a generation. It was published by Oxford University Press in 1900; in its india-paper form it was carried widely around the British Empire and in war as a &#x27;knapsack book&#x27;. It sold close to 500,000 copies in its first edition. In 1939, the editor revised it, deleting several poems (especially from the late 19th century) that he regretted including and adding instead many poems published before 1901 as well as poems published up to 1918. The second edition is now available online.

Various successors have subtly differentiated titles. See Oxford poetry anthologies.

<doc id="740708" wikidata="Q1104394" url="?curid=740708" title="Coast to Coast Walk">
<text>The Coast to Coast Walk is a long-distance footpath between the west and east coasts of Northern England, nominally long. Devised by Alfred Wainwright, it passes through three contrasting national parks: the Lake District National Park, the Yorkshire Dales National Park, and the North York Moors National Park. The current actual measured distance is reported as .

Wainwright recommends that walkers dip their booted feet in the Irish Sea at St Bees and, at the end of the walk, in the North Sea at Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay.

It has been an unofficial and mostly unsignposted trail. However on 12 August 2022 it was announced that the Coast to Coast Walk would become an official National Trail, following a successful campaign by the Wainwright Society (the official Responsible Organisation for the trail). Work will commence to upgrade the route and officially open it in 2026 (at long).

==History and status==

The Coast to Coast was originally described by Alfred Wainwright in his 1973 book &quot;A Coast to Coast Walk&quot;. Wainwright&#x27;s book has since been revised a number of times in recent years (most recently in 2003) with updates to the recommended route.

Wainwright&#x27;s book describes the route in 12 stages, each of which ends at a settlement with at least some overnight accommodation nearby. If one stage is walked per day, with one or two rest days, the route makes a two-week holiday, and web logs of coast-to-coasters seem to indicate that this is the most common way of walking the route. However, Wainwright explicitly states that he did not intend people to necessarily stick to these daily stages, or even to his route. For instance, the majority of Wainwright&#x27;s stages start and end at low level with a single up-down during the day: many walkers split the Borrowdale–Patterdale stage at Grasmere in order to maintain this pattern and avoid having two major uphill sections in one day. Splitting two or three more of the longer stages, and adding a further one or two rest days, reduces the average day-length to 10 or 12 miles and makes the walk a much easier three-week trip with time to &quot;stand and stare&quot;, an activity much approved of by Wainwright. 
The Coast to Coast Walk uses public rights of way (public footpaths, tracks, and minor roads), permissive paths and access land; it is one of the most popular of all the long-distance footpaths in the UK. In 2004 the walk was named as the second-best walk in the world according to a survey of experts. Harvey Maps publishes a dedicated strip map at 1:40,000 scale.
Tradition dictates that walkers should start the route on St Bees beach by getting one&#x27;s feet wet and collecting a pebble. The walk should end in a similar fashion, by wetting the feet and depositing the pebble on the beach at Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay.

==Route==

The description in this article is given from west to east. This is the more popular direction, and the one given in the original and most of the current guides; it is the direction that keeps the prevailing wind and rain at one&#x27;s back, and the evening sun out of one&#x27;s eyes. Some walkers do start from the east coast, either because they wish to have the Lake District as the climax of their walk or because they have already walked the route in the conventional direction.

Wainwright&#x27;s route begins at St Bees in Cumbria, on the Irish Sea. It crosses the West Cumbrian coastal plain and the Lake District, and enters North Yorkshire as it crosses the Pennines. It then crosses the Yorkshire Dales, the Vale of York and the North York Moors to reach the North Sea coast at Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay.

===Lake District===

* From the small seaside town of St Bees, where there is a &quot;C to C&quot; monument by the lifeboat station, the route follows the cliffs of St Bees Head north for a few miles before turning inland to pass through the villages of Sandwith, Moor Row and Cleator in the West Cumberland Plain. It then climbs its first hill (Dent), and follows its first valley (Nannycatch) before reaching Ennerdale Bridge.
* The path goes up the valley of Ennerdale along the edge of Ennerdale Water and past the Black Sail Hut youth hostel. It climbs alongside Loft Beck to the fells north of Great Gable, passes the disused slate workings and mountain tramway of Honister, and descends to Rosthwaite in Borrowdale.
* To leave Borrowdale, the route passes Stonethwaite and follows the stream up to Greenup Edge, before travelling along the Helm Crag ridge and down to Grasmere village.
* From Grasmere the route ascends to the pass of Grisedale Hause from where Wainwright offers a choice of three routes: via either of the mountains of Helvellyn or St Sunday Crag, or an easier descent along the valley of Grisedale, the three options reuniting at Patterdale village.
* From Patterdale, a stiff climb leads to Angle Tarn and Kidsty Pike — at 2,560 feet (780 metres) the highest point on the walk. There is then a steep drop to Haweswater from where the route follows the north shore of the lake before leaving the Lake District and visiting Shap Abbey and the village of Shap itself.

===Westmorland and Yorkshire Dales===
* From Shap the route crosses the limestone pavement of the Westmorland limestone plateau to the village of Orton, and on to Kirkby Stephen.
* The route climbs to the main west/east watershed of England (which forms the Yorkshire border) on the ridge of Nine Standards Rigg, from where moorland trails and upland streams lead down into Swaledale. To help mitigate the effects of erosion, there are alternative routes at different times of the year. At almost exactly its halfway point, the Coast to Coast crosses the Pennine Way at Keld.
* After Keld, there is a choice of two routes, high (open and breezy), or low (riverside, with teashops and pubs), both of which lead to Reeth.
* In lower Swaledale, the route passes Marrick Priory, through wooded hillside to the market town of Richmond.
===Vale of Mowbray and North York Moors===
* After Richmond, the route runs close to the River Wiske (but is more direct than the river) across the flat farming land of the Vale of Mowbray (the northern extension of the Vale of York) to the village of Danby Wiske, and on to Ingleby Cross.
* The route then climbs up to the western edge of the North York Moors to join the Cleveland Way and Lyke Wake Walk and is coincident with these routes over the major summits of the Cleveland Hills (known as the &#x27;Cleveland Frontline&#x27;) as it rises and falls to Clay Bank Top. (Wainwright stated that the Lyke Wake Walk would form an acceptable finish to his &#x27;A Coast to Coast Walk&#x27;, though the former finishes at Ravenscar, 4 miles south of Bay Town, the end point of Wainwright&#x27;s route.) 
* The route continues with the Cleveland Way &amp; Lyke Wake Walk, crossing Urra Moor to Bloworth Crossing, where the Cleveland Way turns north and the Coast to Coast continues east on the trackbed of the dismantled Rosedale Railway (still coincident with the Lyke Wake Walk) to Blakey Ridge and the Lion Inn.
* Next, the route continues around the head of Rosedale before parting ways with the Lyke Wake Walk at the Millennium Stone to skirt Great Fryup Dale before descending Glaisdale Rigg to the village of Glaisdale. From there, a woodland path leads to Egton Bridge where the route follows an old toll road to Grosmont.
* After a climb out of Grosmont, the route crosses Sleights Moor before dropping into Littlebeck Wood (with a hermitage carved out of a single boulder, and the Falling Foss waterfall). From there the route passes through Low and High Hawsker to the cliff tops of the east coast, where it rejoins the Cleveland Way. The path then follows the coast southwards to the village of Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay.

==Places of interest==
The following major headland is traversed by the route:
* St Bees Head
The following hills are crossed by the route:
*Dent
*High Stile (variant)
*Helm Crag (optional)
*Helvellyn and St Sunday Crag (variants)
*Kidsty Pike
*Nine Standards Rigg/Hartley Fell
*Carlton Bank
*Cringle Moor/High Blakey Moor/Glaisdale Moor
*Urra Moor

==Crossings==
In May 2021, the route was run in 39 hours 18 minutes and 40 seconds by Damian Hall, setting a new record. The previous record was set in 1991, 39 hours 36 minutes and 52 seconds by Mike Hartley. The record before that was set in 1985 by Mike Cudahy, who completed it in 46 hours 49 minutes.

<doc id="740710" wikidata="Q13606858" url="?curid=740710" title="Laura Keene">
<text>Laura Keene (20 July 1826 – 4 November 1873) was a British stage actress and theatre manager. In her twenty-year career, she became known as the first powerful female manager in New York. She is most famous for being the lead actress in the play &quot;Our American Cousin&quot;, which was attended by President Abraham Lincoln at Ford&#x27;s Theater in Washington on the evening of his assassination.

==Early life==
Keene was born Mary Frances Moss in Winchester, England. She was the fourth and final child of Tomas and Jane Moss (&quot;née&quot; King). Her aunt was British actress Elizabeth Yates. At the age of 18, she married British Army officer Henry Wellington Taylor (some sources identify Taylor as &quot;John&quot;). Taylor was reportedly the nephew and godson of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. The couple had two daughters, Emma (born 1846) and Clara Marie Stella (born 1849). After being discharged from the army, Taylor opened his own tavern. Around 1850, Taylor was arrested, though the nature of his crime is now unknown. After being convicted, he was reportedly sent from England to Australia on a prison ship. Keene would later travel to Australia in order to locate Taylor to divorce him but could never determine his whereabouts. (Some accounts say that Keene did find Taylor but he refused to consent to a divorce.) They remained married until Taylor&#x27;s death in 1860.

After her husband was sent to prison, Keene was left alone with two children and no money. On the advice of her aunt, she decided to pursue a career as an actress, and would apprentice at her aunt&#x27;s theatre. As it was then socially unacceptable for a woman with children and no husband to act in the theatre, she changed her name to &quot;Laura Keene&quot;. Her now widowed mother Jane took over raising her two daughters.

==Career==
Keene made her professional debut as Pauline in &quot;The Lady of Lyons&quot; in London in October 1851. This was followed by performances at London&#x27;s Royal Olympic Theatre and Royal Lyceum Theatre, including several months working under Madame Vestris. In 1852, less than a year performing in Britain, Keene accepted an offer from James William Wallack to go to New York City, and serve as the leading lady in the stock company at his successful theater.

Her first performance at his theatre was in &quot;The Will&quot; as Albino Mandeville. She enjoyed great popularity during her time at Wallack&#x27;s Theatre (20 September 1852, through 22 November 1853). In order to have greater control over her career, she then entered into theater management with the help of John Lutz, whom she married in 1860 and was with her for the rest of her career. She left Wallack&#x27;s company unexpectedly one night and moved to Baltimore. Keene leased the Charles Street Theater, in Baltimore, from 24 December 1853, to 2 March 1854, where she acted as manager, director and performer. She started doing touring performances in California (6 April through 29 July 1854), in Australia (23 October 1854 through January 1855), and again in California (9 April through 4 October 1855). During the first stint in California, she was hired by Catherine Norton Sinclair to play opposite Edwin Booth. After spending a month as the manager and lessee of the Union Theatre in San Francisco (from 29 June through 29 July 1854), Keene and Booth toured to Australia. Booth&#x27;s drunken behavior in Australia put an end to their relationship and their tour. On her return to California, she also managed the American Theatre. She managed and performed there for a few years until a new law was passed in California banning any form of entertainment on the Sabbath. This greatly decreased the attendance of theatre performances and gave Keene reason to leave and start a new project in New York.

Upon returning to New York City, Keene leased the Metropolitan Theatre, remodeled it, renamed it Laura Keene&#x27;s Varieties. She served as manager, director and star performer until 23 December when William Burton, purchased the building, and moved his own operation there. (It was renamed Burton&#x27;s New Theatre, and then the Winter Garden.)
At this point, she lined up investors, along with an architect who specialized in theaters, and a new theater was constructed to her specifications. Named the Laura Keene&#x27;s Theatre, it opened on 18 November 1856. In November 1857 she put on &quot;The Sea of Ice&quot; to financial success.

Stage entertainment turned over quickly in that era, with few productions exceeding a dozen performances, but Keene bucked those odds. An 1857 show called &quot;The Elves&quot; ran for a record 50 performances. Moreover, 1860 was to prove itself an important year for her theater and American drama as well. On 29 March, she premiered Dion Boucicault&#x27;s &quot;The Colleen Bawn,&quot; which ran for six weeks until the end of the season on 12 May; the highlight of this play was the creation of an ocean island on stage in a scene which culminated with the hero diving into the ocean to save the colleen bawn Eily O&#x27;Connor. (Betting on the play&#x27;s success, Boucicault took &quot;The Colleen Bawn&quot; to London, where it opened on 10 September 1860 and ran for 230 performances, becoming the first long run in the history of English theater.) In November 1860, Keene premiered the musical &quot;The Seven Sisters,&quot; which featured extravagant sets and ran for 253 performances, an astonishing total for the time.

=== Assassination of Abraham Lincoln ===
In 1858, &quot;Our American Cousin&quot; debuted in Laura Keene&#x27;s Theater. On the night of 14 April 1865, Keene&#x27;s company, which primarily included John Dyott and Harry Hawk, were performing &quot;Our American Cousin&quot; at Ford&#x27;s Theatre in Washington, D.C. In attendance that night were President Abraham Lincoln and his wife First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln. Actor John Wilkes Booth fatally shot President Lincoln while Lincoln watched the play from the presidential box; Booth then fled the theatre. Amid the confusion, Keene made her way to the presidential box where Lincoln lay dying and cradled the mortally wounded President&#x27;s head in her lap. President Lincoln&#x27;s fatal head wound bled on her dress, staining her cuff. The cuff was later donated to the National Museum of American History.

==Later years and death==

By 1863, Keene was forced to give up managing her own theatre due to poor health. Keene continued as manager and star of a company which toured the United States for most of the next ten years. She also served as manager of the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia, from 20 September 1869, through 25 March 1870. Her final performance was on 4 July 1873, while touring in northern Pennsylvania.

Keene&#x27;s second husband, John Lutz, died on 18 April 1869. On 4 November 1873, Keene died of tuberculosis at the age of 47 at Montclair, New Jersey. She is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.

== In popular culture ==
In 2007, &quot;Our Leading Lady&quot;, a play by Charles Busch about Laura Keene and Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, opened off-Broadway at Manhattan Theatre Club. The production was directed by Lynne Meadow and starred Kate Mulgrew as Laura Keene.

In 2023, &quot;Tyrants&quot;, an original musical about the life of Edwin Booth, was presented at the National Archives Museum in Washington, D.C. With music and lyrics by Alexander Sage Oyen and a book by Nora Brigid Monahan, the musical featured Jennifer Fouché as Laura Keene and dramatized her relationship with Edwin Booth, who was played by A.J. Shively.

<text>Dallas Crane are a triple ARIA Award nominated Australian alternative rock band from Melbourne. Their self-titled third album was released on 10 July 2004, and peaked in the ARIA Albums Chart top 50. Its lead single, &quot;Dirty Hearts&quot; (June 2004), debuted in the related ARIA Singles Chart top 50.

Dallas Crane&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Factory Girls&quot;, peaked in the top 30. Their highest charting single, &quot;Sit on My Knee&quot; – a duet with Jimmy Barnes – reached No. 14 in July 2005. In 2009 they featured as a support act for The Who on a national stadium tour. After re-grouping following a short hiatus in 2012 Dallas Crane&#x27;s began work on their 5th studio album &quot;Scoundrels&quot; featuring Chris Brodie on bass guitar, Dave Larkin on vocals and guitar, Steve Pinkerton on drums and Pete Satchell on guitar and vocals.
==History==
===1996-1999: Formation and debut album ===
Dallas Crane formed in 1996 in Melbourne by Chris Brodie on bass guitar, Dave Larkin on lead vocals and guitar, Pete Satchell on guitar and vocals and Shan Vanderwert on drums. Satchell and Larkin were former school mates and Brodie and Vanderwert joined soon after. They rehearsed material for their debut album, &quot;Lent&quot; (1998), in a Port Melbourne oil shed on the property of Dallas Crane Transport. The local trucking company was owned by friends: their rehearsals were paid for in beer, and the group were renamed, Dallas Crane.
After working the Melbourne pub circuit they befriended local sound engineer, Robbie Rowlands, (The Fauves, Morning After Girls), who produced their debut self-funded album, &quot;Lent&quot;, which was released locally on their own label, Slant 6. Larkin later recalled &quot;We were pretty young and that was the swag of songs we had at the time. It&#x27;s a fairly incongruous record when you look at it, but we probably rate it as our favorite for that reason. And because it was our first and the whole recording experience was new to us.&quot;
 
One of their fans was Richard Kingsmill of national radio station, Triple J, who invited them to record a track, &quot;Nylon Don&#x27;t Breathe&quot;, live in the ABC studios, during his &quot;Australian Music Show&quot;. The track was co-written by Larkin and Satchell: it appeared on the &quot;Five Alive: Live at the Wireless&quot; (1999) live 2× CD compilation. They were the only unsigned act of 35 artists to appear on the album. This endorsement led to wider interest in the band interstate as they began touring nationally.

===2000-2001: &quot;Twenty Four Seven&quot; to &quot;Dirty Deeds Soundtrack&quot; ===
Dallas Crane toured Australia in support of You Am I and then Regurgitator. Larkin later reflected that You Am I &quot;were instrumental for us in many ways ... When we started out, they were the band that everyone wanted to be. If you could go really well in Australia, you would be going as well as You Am I. In terms of cred and how good you were as a live band, they were it.&quot; Dallas Crane became the head-liners at St. Kilda&#x27;s Esplanade Hotel. Their live repertoire featured tracks that were recorded for a second studio album, &quot;Twenty Four Seven&quot;, which was released on 17 October 2000. They had recorded and mixed the album in a week at Melbourne&#x27;s Hothouse Recording Studios with Craig Harnath producing. Shortly after its release Brodie left due to commitments with his brother Dan Brodie and their band, the Broken Arrows, which had signed to a record label, EMI. Chris Brodie was replaced in Dallas Crane by Pat Bourke on bass guitar in early 2001.
&quot;Twenty Four Seven&quot; received widely positive responses from Australian rock music critics with local rock street press, &quot;Beat Magazine&quot; and &quot;In-Press&quot;, hailing it as &quot;Album of the Week&quot; and &quot;Rock Record of the Summer&quot;, respectively. The lead track, &quot;Sit on My Knee&quot;, which was written by Larkin, was released as a single. It was placed on high rotation by Triple J. The group followed with &quot;Sold Me&quot; and &quot;Already Gone&quot;.

Dallas Crane won Best Live Band at the Australian Live Music Awards, leading to them representing their country at the International Live Music Awards in London in 2002, featuring their debut performance at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire alongside Russell Crowe&#x27;s &quot;Thirty Odd Foot of Grunt&quot;

They continued to win support slots to a number of artists including Ryan Adams, The Black Keys, You Am I and Rocket Science. During their shows with You Am I, lead singer Tim Rogers touted, &quot;Dallas Crane is the best band in the country&quot; and made reference to them in the You Am I single, &quot;Who Put the Devil in You&quot; (September 2002). Rogers curated the soundtrack for a feature film, &quot;Dirty Deeds&quot; (2002), and asked Dallas Crane to supply a cover version of &quot;Wild About You&quot;, originally performed by Australian 1960&#x27;s band, the Missing Links.

===2002-2003: &quot;No Through Road&quot; to &quot;Ladybird&quot; EPs===
Midway through 2002 Dallas Crane signed a management deal with talent managers, Majorbox Music, in Melbourne. The band&#x27;s follow up release was a five-track extended play, &quot;No Through Road&quot;. It was also released as a 7&quot; vinyl single, with the title track and a raucous B-side, &quot;Wannabe&quot;. It was recorded at Sing Sing Studios with Rowlands as producer. The song was well received critically and earned high-rotation on Triple J, consolidating them as a prospering force in the local music scene.
Dallas Crane continued to tour Australia, joining the Whitlams, and Rocket Science on national runs consecutively. They played at Homebake in Sydney in 2003, joining fellow Australian groups the Church and Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds for the festival&#x27;s line-up. Then they teamed up with music mates Dan Brodie and the Broken Arrows and Dan Kelly and the Alpha Males for a national tour, Dan Does Dallas.

Dallas Crane started their own headline tour promoting &quot;No Through Road&quot; and finished the year at Melbourne&#x27;s Big Day Out festival. Shortly after that performance, they gathered backstage to sign with Albert Productions, joining label mates AC/DC on a roster that had included the Easybeats and Rose Tattoo. &quot;Ladybird&quot; was released in November 2003 as the first official Alberts&#x27; release leading to more high-rotation on Triple J.

===2004-2005: Self-titled album ===
Dallas Crane recorded its self-titled third album with Australian producer Wayne Connolly, (You Am I, Underground Lovers). Bourke described how &quot;Wayne saw us play once and loved the show. He seemed to know what to do with us.&quot; Its lead single, &quot;Dirty Hearts&quot;, was issued ahead of the album in June, which debuted in the ARIA Singles Charts Top 50.

The album reached the top 50 on the related ARIA Albums Chart in July 2004. It was acclaimed as their best effort, Graeme Hammond of &quot;Sunday Herald Sun&quot; praised it as &quot;an Australian classic.&quot; The group received three nominations at the ARIA Music Awards of 2004, Best Breakthrough Artist – Album and Best Rock Album for &quot;Dallas Crane&quot; and Best Breakthrough Artist – Single for &quot;Dirty Hearts&quot;. In July they toured the Australian east coast under the pseudonym, Beige Visitors, alongside You Am I, which used the moniker, the Question Fruit.
The singles &quot;Dirty Hearts&quot; and &quot;Numb All Over&quot; went on to achieve high-rotation on Triple J, setting up a string of sellout tours to follow. Both songs featured on the Triple J&#x27;s Hottest 100 album for 2005. Also in that year they re-recorded &quot;Sit on My Knee&quot; as a duet with Jimmy Barnes for his album, &quot;Double Happiness&quot; (July 2005), which was issued as a single. It peaked at No. 14 on the ARIA Singles Chart. According to Michael Tran of Oz Music Project, &quot;It&#x27;s always whether the world needs more well-written, competently played, blues rock... [this] is [Dallas Crane&#x27;s] song, after all. Always one of the strongest in their catalogue, this recording offers simply a spit-and-buff job to the original. The production is cleaner and brighter than the more lo-fi original; radio will love the sound. And really, there&#x27;s nothing at all wrong with it.&quot;

In August 2005 the group provided a cover version of &quot;Dig It Up&quot; for the Hoodoo Gurus tribute album, &quot;Stoneage Cameos&quot;, by various Australian artists. Bourke was also a member of a short-term super-group, The Wrights, which provided their rendition of &quot;(Let&#x27;s All) Turn On&quot;.

===2006: &quot;Factory Girls&quot; ===
In early 2006 Dallas Crane released a single, &quot;Lovers and Sinners&quot;, making it freely available via their website. The band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Factory Girls&quot;, recorded with producers, Connolly and Jonathan Burnside, was released on 16 September 2006. It reached No. 30 in October – their highest charting album. It first single, &quot;Curiosity&quot;, was released physically on 26 August 2006, following a pre-release on the Australian iTunes Music Store. Australian Rolling Stone magazine rated it as four out of five. Craig Mathieson of &quot;The Age&quot; felt that &quot;by dint of songwriting strength, ease of expression and a touch of studio sweat – Melbourne four-piece Dallas Crane stay on the right side of the great divide... between being timeless and out of time.&quot;
In August 2006 the band commenced an east coast tour of Australia to promote their new material. A performance at Brisbane&#x27;s The Zoo received positive reviews in local independent media and reaffirmed the band&#x27;s popularity as a rock act. They undertook a more extensive tour during September, and then travelled overseas for their second United Kingdom visit, following with an appearance at the SXSW Festival in Austin, Texas. They performed in Japan on the way home from the tour which saw them garner interest from offshore recording labels.

With close to 1500 acts from around the world performing gigs, Dallas Crane joined a local contingent of Australasian artists at SXSW 2007, alongside Beasts of Bourbon, You Am I, Hoodoo Gurus, Expatriate, Youth Group and Airbourne. Their United States visit saw them also perform at the Los Angeles venue The Troubadour, New York&#x27;s Bowery Ballroom, and Boston&#x27;s Middle East Club. On returning to Australia, in early 2007, they headlined a national tour with support from burgeoining rock act Airbourne, their last for what was to become a brief hiatus away from the touring circuit.

=== 2007-2011: Taking a break===
After performing for almost eleven years Dallas Crane finished their tour with a headline spot at Melbourne&#x27;s St.Kilda Festival in February 2007. In 2009 they reunited briefly after being asked to join UK rock act, the Who, on six arena dates of their national tour, which included a spot at Melbourne&#x27;s Grand Prix.

During the hiatus Dave Larkin released two albums with his three-piece act, Gun Street Girls. Pete Satchell had his own solo moniker, Pete Sounds. Dallas Crane reunited again in early 2010 to play a farewell gig for the family of the band&#x27;s namesake, Dallas Crane (of the trucking company), who had died of cancer.

=== 2012-present:&quot;Scoundrels&quot;===
Dallas Crane resumed in 2012 with Larkin and Satchell writing new material. The line-up had changed, bassist Pat Bourke and drummer Shan Vanderwert were replaced by Chris Brodie and Steve Pinkerton, respectively. The renewed group&#x27;s first single, &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry Darling&quot;, was released, digitally and on 7&quot;, in October 2013, with the official music video issued in January 2014.

In November 2015 they provided their fifth studio album, &quot;Scoundrels&quot;, which was produced by Harnath. Andrew McMillen of &quot;The Australian&quot; rated it 4.5 stars claiming, &quot;It&#x27;s a towering achievement that sees Dallas Crane exhibiting that key-in-lock feel sought by every rock band. These four players are masters of their craft. The band&#x27;s time off has been well-spent, as every idea here hits the mark. If anything, it&#x27;s an embarrassment of riches&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Jaymz Clements rated it as four out of five, and felt that &quot;Dallas Crane have grown into a smarter, better band is no surprise. That they&#x27;ve given themselves a masterful Don Walker-ish overhaul certainly is. Scoundrels is intelligent, bluesy, mature and unpredictable...&quot;

From late December 2015 and into April 2016 the group undertook a national headline tour promoting the album.

In October 2016, the band released the single &quot;Cheyenne&quot; (digital only) also recorded by Jez Giddings and Craig Harnath at Melbourne&#x27;s Hothouse Audio.

In August 2022, Dallas Crane opened for KISS at Melbourne&#x27;s Rod Laver Arena.

<text>Richard Cosway (5 November 1742 – 4 July 1821) was a leading English portrait painter of the Georgian and Regency era, noted for his miniatures. He was a contemporary of John Smart, George Engleheart, William Wood, and Richard Crosse. He befriended fellow Freemason and Swedenborgians William Blake and Chevalier d&#x27;Éon. His wife was the Italian-born painter Maria Cosway, a close friend of Thomas Jefferson.

==Early years==
Richard Cosway was born in Tiverton, Devon, the son of a schoolmaster. He was initially educated at Blundell&#x27;s School, where his father was master, but at the age of twelve he was allowed to travel to London to take lessons in painting. Soon after his arrival, in 1754, he won a prize from the Society of Arts. He studied briefly with fellow Devonian Thomas Hudson, then with William Shipley, and by 1760 had established his own business. He exhibited his first works at the age of 20 in 1762 and was soon in demand.

He was one of the first group of associate members of the Royal Academy, elected in August 1770, and was elected a full member the following March, on the casting vote of the academy&#x27;s president, Sir Joshua Reynolds. He is included in Johan Zoffany&#x27;s group portrait of the members of the academy (begun in 1771); a late addition to the composition, he was painted on an extra strip of canvas, attached to the right-hand side of the painting.

==Career in art==
He painted the future King George IV in 1780 and was appointed Painter to the Prince of Wales in 1785—the only time this title was ever awarded. His subjects included the Prince&#x27;s first wife, Maria Anne Fitzherbert, and various English and French aristocrats, including Madame du Barry, mistress of King Louis XV of France.

Cosway&#x27;s pupils included Andrew Plimer (1763–1837).

From 1995 to 1996, the National Portrait Gallery in London held an exhibition entitled &quot;Richard and Maria Cosway: Regency Artists of Taste and Fashion&quot;, with 250 works on display.

==Personal life==

On 18 January 1781, Cosway married the Anglo-Italian artist Maria Hadfield. Maria was a composer, musician and authority on girls&#x27; education and was much admired by Thomas Jefferson, who wrote letters to her decrying her marriage to another man and kept an engraving made from one of Cosway&#x27;s paintings of Maria at Monticello.

The Cosways&#x27; marriage is thought to be an arranged marriage of convenience, and not only due to his being 20 years her senior. Richard Cosway was an effeminate Macaroni with &quot;a mincing, affected air&quot; dressed in the height of fashion: &quot;His small plain person was to be seen in all the public places clothed in a mulberry silk coated embroidered with scarlet strawberries, with a sword and bag and small three-cornered hat perched on the top of his powdered toupée.&quot; It was also said he was &quot;well known as a libertine and commonly described as resembling a monkey.&quot;

In 1784, the Cosways moved into Schomberg House, Pall Mall, which became a fashionable salon for London society. They employed the former slave Ottobah Cugoano as a servant. In 1791 they moved to a larger house in Stratford Place. In 1821, after selling most of the treasures he had accumulated, he went to reside in Edgware Road. 

In later life, Cosway also suffered from mental disorders and spent some time in various institutions. He died in London in 1821 and was buried at St Marylebone Parish Church. Sir John Soane bought more than 30 objects put up for sale at auction after Cosway&#x27;s death.

Cosway&#x27;s wife Maria survived him many years, and died in Italy in January 1838, in a school for girls which she had founded, and which she had attached to an important religious order devoted to the cause of female education, known as the . She had been created a baroness of the Empire on account of her devotion to female education by the emperor Francis I in 1834.

<doc id="740718" wikidata="Q1341143" url="?curid=740718" title="Volvo 200 Series">
<text>The Volvo 200 Series (or 240 and 260 Series) is a range of mid-size luxury cars produced by Swedish company Volvo Cars from 1974 until 1993, with more than 2.8 million total units sold worldwide. Like the Volvo 140 Series (1966 to 1974), from which it was developed, it was designed by Jan Wilsgaard.

The series overlapped production of the Volvo 700 Series (1982 to 1992). As the 240 Series remained popular, only the 260 Series was displaced by the 700 Series, which Volvo marketed alongside the 240 for another decade. The 700 was replaced by the 900 Series in 1992, a year before the 240 was discontinued. Production of the 240 ended on 14 May 1993, after nearly 20 years, with the basic platform and architecture lasting 27 years, if the production run of the original 140 Series is aggregated.

== History ==
The Volvo 240 and 260 series were introduced in the autumn of 1974, and was initially available as six variations of the 240 Series (242L, 242DL, 244DL, 244GL, 245L and 245DL) and two variations of the 260 Series (264DL and 264GL). The 240 Series was available as a sedan (with two or four doors) or a station wagon, however, the 260 Series was available as a coupé (262C Bertone), two-door sedan, four-door sedan, or station wagon. The 200 looked much like the earlier 140 and 164, they shared the same basic body shell and were largely identical from the cowl rearward. However, the 200 incorporated many of the features and design elements tried in the Volvo VESC ESV in 1972, which was a prototype experiment in car safety. The overall safety of the driver and passengers in the event of a crash was greatly improved with very large front and rear end crumple zones. Another main change was the new engines offered, which were of an overhead cam design based on the earlier B20. The 260 series also received a V6 engine in lieu of the 164&#x27;s inline-six.

The 200 Series had MacPherson strut-type front suspension, which increased room around the engine bay, while the rear suspension was a modified version of that fitted to the 140 Series. The steering was greatly improved with the introduction of rack-and-pinion steering, with power steering fitted as standard to the 244GL, 264DL and 264GL, and there were some modifications made to the braking system (in particular the master cylinder).

The front end of the car was also completely restyled with a &quot;shovel nose&quot; which closely resembled that of the VESC prototype vehicle – that being the most obvious change which made the 200 Series distinguishable from the earlier 140 and 160 Series. Other than all the changes mentioned above, the 200 Series was almost identical to the 140 and 160 Series from the bulkhead to the very rear end. In 1978, a facelift meant a redesigned rear end for sedans, with wraparound taillights and a trunk opening with a lower lip. The dashboard was derived from the safety fascia introduced for the 1973 model year 100 Series – the main change for the 200 Series was the adoption of slatted &quot;egg crate&quot; style air vents in place of the eyeball style vents used in the 140/160 and the square clock. All models were available with a choice of four-speed manual or a three-speed automatic transmission. Overdrive was also optional on the manual 244GL, while a five-speed manual gearbox was optional on the 264GL and 265GL.

In the autumn of 1975 (for the 1976 model year in America), the 265 DL estate became available alongside the existing range, and this was the first production Volvo estate to be powered by a six-cylinder engine. The choice of gearboxes was also improved, with overdrive now available as an option in all manual models except the base-model 242L and 245L. As before, a three-speed automatic was optional in every model. The B21A engine gained three horsepower; a new steering wheel and gearknob were also introduced.

At the 1976 Paris Motor Show Bertone first showed the stretched 264 TE, a seven-seat limousine on a wheelbase, although it had entered production earlier. The raw bodies were sent from Sweden to Grugliasco for lengthening, reinforcing, and finishing. Carl XVI Gustav of Sweden used one, as did much of East Germany&#x27;s political leadership.

For 1977 the B19A engine with replaced the B20A in most markets, although the old pushrod type soldiered on for another two years in some places. This is also the year that the sportier 242 GT arrived.

In 1978 the grille was altered, now with a chrome surround. Rear view mirrors were now black, while the front seats were changed as were the emblems, while interval wipers were introduced. 1978 models were also the first 240s to receive a new paint formula, to help solve the severe rust problems in previous model years.

The 1979 model year brought a full facelift front and rear, the most obvious change being the adoption of flush fitting square headlamps on the DL or rectangular headlamps on the GL, GLE in place of the recessed circular units. The sedans received new wraparound rear lamp clusters and a restyled leading edge to the trunk lid, while the rear of the wagons remained unchanged. The GLE was added while the L was cancelled, and the six-cylinder diesel arrived late in the year. For 1980, the sporty GLT arrived, replacing the GT. For 1981 there was yet another new grille, while the station wagons received new, wraparound taillights. The B21A gained some four horsepower, now , while the carburetted B23A with was introduced in some markets. The Turbo arrived, while six-cylinder models now had a more powerful 2.8-liter engine. 1981 also saw the dashboard altered significantly, which a much larger binnacle in order to bring the radio and clock within the driver&#x27;s line of sight. The instrument pod itself, which had been unaltered since the 1973 model year 100 Series, was also redesigned.

Incremental improvements were made almost every year of the production run. One of the major improvements was the introduction of the oxygen sensor in North America in late 1976 (1977 models), which Volvo called &quot;Lambda Sond&quot; and developed in conjunction with Bosch. It added a feedback loop to the Jetronic fuel injection system already in use, which allowed fine-tuning of the air and fuel mixture and therefore produced superior emissions, drivability and fuel economy.

For the 1983 model year, Volvo dropped the DL and GLE labels, selling the cars simply as 240s. In the domestic Swedish market, the 240 could be had with a 2.1- or 2.3-liter engine (more options were available in export), but the bigger engine always came coupled with a five-speed transmission and tinted windows. The 1983s also received wider side trim and all models had the larger taillights introduced on the previous year&#x27;s GLT model. A B23E-engined GLE variant was also added (not available with two doors). Buyers protested against the lack of grades and they returned for 1984. A new manual gearbox also arrived for 1984, while a four-speed automatic option was available in the GL. The GLT and Turbo versions received a taller grille.

While Volvo had been planning to discontinue the 200-series since the early 1980s, the design kept selling well and Volvo provided steady updates. In late 1991, for the 1992 model year, it received 160 detail improvements including changes to the heater controls, heated rear view mirrors, and revised front seats. For the final, 1993 model year, air conditioning units were upgraded to use R-134a rather than the ozone-depleting R-12 (Freon).

About one-third of all 240s sold were station wagons, which featured very large cargo space of . They could be outfitted with a rear-facing foldable jumpseat in the passenger area, making the wagon a seven-passenger vehicle. The jumpseat came with three-point seat belts, and wagons were designed to have a reinforced floor section, protecting the occupants of the jumpseat in the event of a rear-end collision.

A 1993 Volvo 240DL was driven by IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad, who stopped driving it when he was told the car was too dangerous due to outdated safety design two decades later.

The last regular 200 series car produced was a blue station wagon built to Italian &quot;Polar Italia&quot; specifications, displayed at the Volvo World Museum. It was manufactured on the 14th May 1993. To round off the production, Volvo produced one shortened two door station wagon, to symbolize shortened leadtimes. The car was white, with the text &quot;KORTA LEDTIDER&quot; (Swedish for &quot;short leadtimes&quot;) on the doors.

== Engines ==
The 200 series was offered with three families of engines. Most 240s were equipped with Volvo&#x27;s own &quot;red block&quot;, 2.0–2.3-liter four-cylinder engines. Both overhead valve and overhead cam versions of the red block engines were installed in 240s. The B20 was used only in the early years and subsequently replaced by the B19, a smaller version of the B21. Power of the carburetted versions increased for the 1979 model year. V6 engines were also available, first in the 260-models, but also later in the GLE- and GLT-versions of 240. Known as the PRV family, they were developed in a three-way partnership among Volvo, Peugeot and Renault, 240 diesel models are powered by diesel engines purchased from Volkswagen. In Greece and Israel the 1.8-liter B17 engine was available beginning with the 1980 model year (also as a luxuriously equipped 260). This smaller twin-carb engine developed , and had considerably higher fuel consumption than even the turbocharged top version.

The 1974 240 series retained the B20A inline-four engine from the 140 Series in certain markets, with the new &quot;B21A&quot; engine available as an option on the 240 DL models. The new &quot;B21&quot; engine was a 2,127 cc, four-cylinder unit, which had a cast-iron block, a five-bearing crankshaft, and a belt-driven overhead camshaft. This engine produced for the B21A carburettor 242DL, 244DL and 245DL, and for the &quot;B21E&quot; fuel-injected 244GL. The carburetted B19A also produced , although at 5400 rpm, while the fuel injected B19E claimed .

=== North American inline-fours ===
The OHV B20F engine was carried over to the new 200-Series when they went on sale in the United States and Canada for the 1975 and 1976 model years. No carbureted engines were available until 1977 when Canada went metric.

With the tightening emission regulations in the United States, the new OHC B21F with fuel injection and EGR system replaced B20F for the 1976 model year. Lambda-Sond and the three-way catalytic converter became available in 1977 on California emissions vehicles only. In 1980, 49 state cars also received Lambda-Sond. The Canadian market had both carbureted B21A (again as a base engine from 1977 to 1984) and fuel-injected B21F engines. The B21F engine was revised with higher compression flat-top pistons in 1979 for increased output to 107 SAE hp or . The Bosch LH-Jetronic fuel injection system replaced the K-Jetronic on certain B21F engines in 1982, sharing less part commonality with the turbocharged B21FT engine.

The B21 was enlarged to 2.3 liters and renamed as B23E for the Canadian market only with a K grind camshaft in 1981 and B23F for both markets in 1983. The B23E with higher compression ratio used the mechanical K-Jetronic and wasn&#x27;t fitted with catalytic converter. In 1983, the B23E received an A grind camshaft from the B21A engine and switched to the normal B21F style head from the higher performance 405 casting used on the older B23E engines. Compression ratio was bumped up from 10.0:1 to 10.3:1. Horsepower dropped to 115 SAE hp from 136 DIN hp (127 SAE). The B23F used LH-Jetronic system and catalytic converter. All early 1983 B23F engines had the same compression ratio as the 1983 B23E, but, due to Chrysler ignition system usage, provided only 107 hp. After the switch to a Bosch distributor and coil, horsepower went up to 114 hp for the high compression B23F. In mid-1983, a lower compression B23F was introduced that had less horsepower (111 hp), but more torque (136 ft.lbs versus 133 ft.lbs, produced at 2750 rpm, instead of 3500 rpm). That version was used on M46-equipped cars only.

B21FT, the first turbocharged engine from Volvo, was added to the 200-Series in late 1980 for the 1981 model year. The output was increased to 126 SAE hp or . Like the european B21ET, the B21FT used the K-Jetronic mechanical fuel injection system, but with Lambda-Sond and catalytic converter added. In 1982, the horsepower was increased to 127 hp. With some modifications to the fuel system, horsepower was increased to 131 SAE in 1984. The turbocharged engine did not have the intercooler until 1983 when the optional extra-cost &quot;intercooler boost system&quot; (IBS) was offered. The IBS became standard equipment in mid-1984. Despite the introduction of the new B23 engine, B21FT engine was never enlarged to 2.3 liters.

Starting in 1983, certain Canadian models received the same B23F engines fitted to the US models (49-state emission regulations) and the B21FT (conformed to the California emission regulations).

In 1985, the B21A was dropped, and the new B230F engine was introduced for use in all non-turbo 240s in both markets. Had a 9.8:1 compression ratio, instead of 10.3:1 for the earlier B23F in automatic and early 1983 manual form, or 9.5:1 for late 1983 through 1984 manual form. Had the higher horsepower number of the automatic B23F (114 SAE net hp) and the higher torque number of the low compression manual B23F (136 foot-pounds of torque). Fuel system was, again, LH-Jetronic, but updated to 2.2, which used a different mass airflow sensor and computers. It also was redesigned to be lower-friction than the earlier B21 and B23 engines with lighter weight connecting rods and pistons that had a shorter skirt. In 1989, the B230F received the Bosch LH-Jetronic version 2.4 fuel injection system, which added OBD-1 onboard diagnostics. The ignition system was similarly updated from the Volvo/Chrysler ignition system that used a Bosch coil and distributor to the Bosch EZK-116K system. Some manual 1990–93 B230F engines used the LH-Jetronic 3.1 system, which used a heated film mass airflow sensor, instead of the usual hot wire sensor.

=== Six-cylinder PRV ===
The 260 models had a completely new 90-degree V6 &quot;B27E&quot; engine, sometimes called the &quot;Douvrin&quot;. This engine was developed jointly by Peugeot, Renault and Volvo in collaboration, and is therefore generally known as the &quot;PRV engine&quot;. This engine was unusual at the time, being composed of many small parts in a modular design (as opposed to a monolithic engine block and head). The &quot;B27E&quot; engine has a displacement of 2,664 cc, an aluminium alloy block, and wet cylinder liners. This engine produces for both the 264DL and 264GL. In fuel-injected form, the &quot;B27F&quot; was introduced to the US in the 1976 260 series. The two-door 262 DL and GL sedans, the 264DL saloon (sedan) and the new 265DL estate (station wagon) were offered outside North America with the &quot;B27A&quot; engine. Almost identical to the fuel-injected V6 &quot;B27E&quot; engine, it has an SU carburettor instead of fuel injection, and therefore it produces a lower output of . The PRV engine (B27E in 1980, B28E 1981–1984) was also used in 244/245 GLT6 on several markets as an option until 1984.

Volvo increased engine displacement to 2.8 liters in 1980 with the introduction of the &quot;B28E&quot; and &quot;B28F&quot;, which were prone to top-end oiling troubles and premature camshaft wear. Some export markets also received the lower output carburetted &quot;B28A&quot; engine with at 5,250 rpm, capable of running on lower-octane fuel. Volvo also installed the &quot;B28&quot; V6 in their new 760 model and the engine was used by numerous other manufacturers in the 1970s and 1980s. The updated &quot;B280&quot; engine used in the final years of the 760 and 780 models did not suffer from the same premature camshaft wear as the earlier PRV engines. In North America, the 260 series was only available with a three-speed automatic transmission or a five-speed manual transmission with electronic overdrive and the engine produces .

=== VW diesels ===
Announced at the 1978 Paris Motor Show, the Volvo 240 GL D6 was introduced in the spring of 1979. Volvo&#x27;s new diesel engine was purchased from Volkswagen and was a six-cylinder iteration of the ones installed in diesel Volkswagen and Audi vehicles at the time. Production was initially low, with only around 600 built by the time of the introduction of the 1980 model year cars. A turbocharged diesel was never sold in the 200 series. At the time of introduction, the six-cylinder Volvo was one of the fastest as well as quietest diesels sold. These engines are all liquid-cooled, pre-combustion chamber, diesel engines with non-sleeved iron blocks and aluminum heads. A Bosch mechanical injection system is used that requires constant electrical input so that the fuel supply can be cut off when the ignition key is removed.

A 2.4-liter inline-six (the &quot;D24&quot;) and a 2.0-liter inline-five (the &quot;D20&quot;) were available, producing and respectively. The lesser &quot;D20&quot; engine was the same as installed in the contemporary Audi 100; it was only sold in select markets where it was favoured by the tax structures. Most D5s went to Finland but it was also marketed in Italy between 1979 and 1981. By 1985 the D6 had replaced the D5 in Finland as well. The D5 was very slow, much slower than the D6 or the Audi 100 with the same five-cylinder engine, reaching 100 km/h from a standing start in 24.4 seconds. The D5 used the same four-speed manual transmission as the D6 but coupled to the lower-geared rear axle also used in 2-liter petrol cars; this meant that fuel consumption figures were only marginally better than those of the larger diesel while noise levels increased noticeably. In Finland, the price difference with the equal six-cylinder diesel was only just over two percent; owners expected to save money by being in much lower tax and insurance brackets.

The diesel had originally been intended to be sold North America first and foremost, but in actuality the &quot;D24&quot; only became available in the North American market beginning with the 1980 model year. After the US diesel market collapsed, sales decreased to ever smaller numbers and it was discontinued after the 1985 model year. No diesels were actually delivered during 1980 as Volvo had a hard time meeting the EPA&#x27;s environmental standards. The federalized diesel developed a claimed , but was not certified for sale in California.

== Badges ==
=== Nomenclature ===
The 200-series cars were identified initially by badges on their trunk lid or rear hatch in a manner similar to the system used for previous models. The &quot;4&quot; and &quot;6&quot; codes soon lost their original meaning as signifying the number of cylinders with the introduction of &quot;B17&quot;-engined four-cylinder Volvo 260s for export to Greece and Israel in the late 1970s. There was also a six-cylinder 240 GLT in some markets, as well as both six- and five-cylinder diesels labelled &quot;240&quot;. The second digit now only denoted how luxurious the car was. By June 1982, with the introduction of the model year 1983 Volvos, the third digit too lost its meaning and the 242/244/245 became simply the 240.

* 1974–1982: three digits (in the format &quot;2XY&quot;, where X usually represents the number of cylinders and &quot;Y&quot; represents the doors: &quot;2&quot; for coupés, &quot;4&quot; for sedans, &quot;5&quot; for station wagons) followed by trim level letters. For example; 244 and 245 were four-cylinder sedans and wagons respectively and 264 and 265 six-cylinder sedans and wagons respectively.
* 1983–1993: &quot;240&quot; (or &quot;260&quot; until 1985) followed by trim level letters (third digit no longer reflects body style, although it is reflected in the engine compartment label, as well as on the label in the trunk on sedans or under the main cargo compartment storage lid on wagons). Special models (e.g. Polar and Torslanda) sometimes omit the &quot;240&quot;.

For the American market:
* 1975–1979: trim level letters preceded by three digits (in the format &quot;2XY&quot;, where &quot;X&quot; usually represents the number of cylinders and Y represents the doors: &quot;2&quot; for coupés (only for the 262C. 242 are two-door sedans), &quot;4&quot; for sedans, &quot;5&quot; for station wagons)
* 1980–1985: trim level letters. A small number of four-cylinder 260s were produced, namely the 1980–1981 GL sedan, which could either be a 240 or a 260. Additionally, diesel 240s have six-cylinder engines.
* 1986–1993: &quot;240&quot; followed by trim level letters (third digit no longer reflects body style), although it is reflected in the engine compartment label, as well as on the label in the trunk on sedans or under the main cargo compartment storage lid on wagons.

==== Trim levels ====
Throughout the 200-series&#x27; production, different levels of luxury were available for purchase. The specific trim level designations ranged from the 242/244/245 L, being the least expensive, to the highest specification 264/265 GLE saloon and estate models respectively. The actual equipment and availability of a particular trim level varied depending on the market. The letters normally appear on the trunk lid or rear hatch of the car (except for during MY1983) and had originally represented the following, although by the 1980s the letter codes had officially lost any underlying meaning:

*L (Luxe) Typical for early work vans
*DL (de Luxe)
*GL (Grand Luxe)
*GLE (Grand Luxe Executive)
*GLT (Grand Luxe Touring)
*GT (Only 2-door sedans, &quot;242&quot; )
*Turbo (Offered from 1981. Mostly equivalent to GLT trim, called &quot;GLT Turbo&quot; in the US)

==== Engine type ====
Sometimes, the engine type of a car was also designated by badging. In some instances, these badges were omitted, replaced trim level badges, or even used in combination with them:

* Turbo (a separate trim level, similar to GLT – 1981–83 models also had GLT Turbo models)
* Diesel (had most GL features, but some omissions)
* Injection (indicating K-Jetronic fuel injection in certain markets)
* Katalysator (indicating a catalytic converter in Scandinavia and the German market)

== Market differences ==

===European/Australian market===
* Glass-lens headlamps compliant with international ECE headlighting standards, 1974–1993
* Fender-mounted side turn signal repeaters introduced various years in different European markets per local regulations; worldwide except North America starting in 1984, Australia starting in 1989
* Daytime running lamps implemented by a second, bright 21W filament in the parking lamp bulbs, introduced mid-1970s in Scandinavia and the UK, and in some other markets outside North America in the early 1980s

* Aspheric sideview mirrors from the 1980 model year (originally not for the DL)
* Diesel engine available (except Australia) from 1979 to 1993

For 1980, the 240 GT and GLE were dropped from most markets, as well as the 265 GLE. In the UK and Australia the 265 GLE was available until 1985 (now badged &quot;260&quot;). The new GLT model which replaced GT and GLE had the GT&#x27;s fuel injected 2.3-liter engine with manual transmission (sedan only), or the 260&#x27;s 2.7-liter V6 with in station wagons or in automatic-equipped sedans.

=== North American market ===

* Exterior lighting system compliant with US federal standards
** Sealed-beam headlamps 1975–1985
** Speedometer in miles per hour with inner scale in kilometres per hour; odometer in miles (US market)
** Plastic-lens replaceable-bulb headlamps 1986–1993
** Headlamp wipers not available; wiper shaft hole below headlamps blanked with rubber plug
** Front and rear side markers and reflectors incorporated into front parking and rear tail lights
** Rear fog lamps added in the 1985 model year
** Daytime running lights, using low beams and tail lamps introduced in 1990 in Canada.
* In Canada, various market-specific parts such as block heaters were also added at the Volvo Halifax Assembly.

For 1981, the 260 estate was dropped but the new GLT and GLT Turbo models joined the lineup. The diesel engine was discontinued in 1984, but was still sold in the 1985 model year with a 1984 VIN and 1985 specs. The Turbo model was discontinued in early 1985.

===American-spec headlamp configurations (1974–1993)===
&quot;Quad&quot; indicates two headlamps per side; all others one headlamp per side
== Special editions ==

* 244 DLS (1977–78): Export model to the former German Democratic Republic with 264 hood and grille from 264DL. Engine B21A. Five different body paintings (solid) available. Total amount exported approx. 1,000 units. The cars were mainly sold to residents of East Germany. Sedans only.
* DLi – MY 1978 limited edition for West Germany. DL trim; equipped with fuel-injected &quot;B21E&quot; engine (instead of &quot;B21A&quot; carbureted engine on standard &quot;DL&quot; models). Mostly sedans.
* GLi: MYs 1981 and 1982 specification for the Netherlands. GL trim; equipped with fuel-injected &quot;B21E&quot; engine (instead of &quot;B21A&quot; carbureted engine on standard &quot;GL&quot; models there and then). Only estates.

* 264 TE (top executive, 1976–81): A limousine version of the 264; many now reside in Germany as 135 production models, two in landaulet form, were converted and exported to the former German Democratic Republic until 1984 for transporting government officials, who would neither use the small Trabant or Wartburg models nor import West German autos such as BMWs and Mercedes-Benzes. As a result of the number of politicians seen driving to and from their preferred home town in Volvo 264 TEs, the East German public nicknamed Wandlitz &quot;Volvograd&quot;.
* 245 T (transfer) (1977-early 1980s): An extended wheelbase station wagon designed to have additional rows of seats for use as taxi or rural school bus. These cars had the same wheelbase as the 264 top executive.
* 262C/coupé by Bertone (1978–1981): This had custom body work and interior from Bertone. The exterior coach building of these two-door saloons consisted of a chopped roof (2.25in shorter than 242) and a more raked windscreen. The 1980 &amp; 1981 models were badged &quot;coupé&quot; instead of &quot;262C&quot;. These cars were further characterized by additional Bertone badges on the front wings. Mostly built in left hand drive form, right hand drive vehicles are very rare.

* 242 GT (1978–80, until 1981 in Australia): Sport model with tuned sport suspension and a fuel injected engine. All US models were Mystic Silver metallic with black and red racing stripes going from the hood to the side to the trunk. Special black corduroy interior with red stripes. 1980 Canadian models were available in black with red pinstripes along the side of the car, in addition to the US model silver. Only 200 black GTs were made. The model was created as Volvo in the US had enjoyed a sportier image and though Volvo now felt too safe and boring. Due to short time and budget constraints they had to make the most with small means. It used the same B21E (B21F in North America) engine as the GL model but it received ventilated front disc brakes, The chassis was improved with front braces, strengthened stabilizers and 30% harder springs than a regular DL. It changed the car from being prone to understeer to being prone to oversteer, something that was often shown in advertising pictures. 3M had approached Volvo about new stripes that would not fade or get damaged in automatic car washes. All 242GTs came in silver metallic with stripes in black and red-orange. Another design change is that decor that was normally chromed was black and vice versa. It had fog lights in the grille as standard and a front spoiler. For the first time in a Volvo the headliner was black. The seats were in black corduroy with red-orange stripes. The dashboard got a central tachometer. In 1979 it got the new high-compression B23E engine. The majoritry of GT model cars were M46 manual transmission, but some Australian market cars did have a BW55 3-speed automatic transmission swapped into them by the importer.
* GLT Turbo (1981–1985): Replaced the GT as the sporty model, equipped with a turbocharged engine, with the 760T intercooler from late 1983, following the sale of the 500 FIA Evolution cars, which were the first 240Ts to be fitted with this uprated intercooler as standard. The two-door model was available 1981–1984; four-door sedans available late 1981-early 1985 and wagons available 1982-early 1985. Came with new black trim as opposed to the popular chrome trim found on the GLs (grill, door trim, door handles, tail light sills and lens dividers). All came factory stock with 15&quot; Virgo alloy wheels.
* GLT (1980–82): Standing for &quot;grand luxe touring,&quot; these models shared the uprated suspension, blacked-out exterior trim, and 15&quot; Virgo alloy wheels of the GLT-Turbo model, but with a naturally aspirated powertrain.
* GTX – this was not an actual trim level, but the name of a sporty parts package available from Volvo dealers in much of Scandinavia
* 244/240 GLE (1981–85) Australian market: Due to the problems with fitting a turbocharger to a RHD vehicle the Turbo model was rebadged GLE and retained all the blacked-out trim and high-end interior fittings of the Turbo models but were equipped with the &quot;B23E&quot; then &quot;B230E&quot; engines. These were most frequently fitted with the BW55 transmission until 1983 then the AW71 for 1984 and 1985.
* 240 Turbo Evolution (1983): 500 &quot;Evolution&quot; models were built to satisfy production requirements to qualify for the FIA&#x27;s International Group A touring car racing. The homologation process, intended to make the car competitive with the Jaguar XKS and BMW 635s coupés, was controversial because VMS (Volvo Motor Sport) elected to convert 500 designated cars simultaneously in the United States rather than directly on the European assembly lines. Once inspected by the FIA in the US, the assembled 500 Evolution cars would be stripped of the Evolution kit parts and sold across America. For the sake of clarity all 500 of these cars had sunroofs, and none were ever shipped back to VMS to be built up into Group A race cars. Only the Swedish-built 240 DL body shells were used because they were did not have the undesirable sunroof cutout. VMS realized that there was a loophole in the FIA regulations at that time which did not require that the &quot;Evolution&quot; cars be sold to the public, but merely built and inspected prior to being granted homologation status. Hence the controversy that followed the success of the factory cars when they won the European Touring Car Championship in 1985 and would have won again in 1986, but for a fuel irregularity at one race meeting. This fuel incident also resulted in the board of directors withdrawing from factory supported GpA racing programs. Due to constraints there was insufficient time to install the Evolution components in the 500 designated 240 Turbo cars as they went down the assembly lines in Belgium (save only for the fitting of the European market only flat-nose bonnet and matching grille) and so a decision was made to stow each car&#x27;s Evolution component kit into the trunks of each of the designated cars before they were shipped to the US, and then retro-fit the component in the US. 270 of these cars were sent to Volvo&#x27;s West Coast facility at Long Island, LA, and the remaining 230 cars were sent to Volvo&#x27;s East Coast facility at Chesapeake Bay, VA. During a period of three weeks all 500 cars were simultaneously retro-fitted with the Evolution kits. However, immediately following the FIA&#x27;s random inspection of all 500 &quot;Evolution&quot; cars, the installation teams removed all of the Evolution components with the exception of the uprated intercooler and sold to the public as the first of the new uprated 240 Turbo intercooler cars. One car kept its parts and was sent back to VMS. The intercooler was the same kind as used in the 1983 European 760 Turbo. While no full Evolution cars were ever sold to the public, the remaining 499 flat-nosed cars that were sold to the American public were unique, in as much as they were the only flat-nosed 240 Turbo intercooler cars ever imported into the US. All carry a &quot;SO2476&quot; designation on the chassis plate. All subsequent 1983 240 Turbo Intercooler cars had the typical projecting, so called coffin-nose and grille, but were fitted as standard with an uprated intercooler which developed more power yet. None of the 500 Evolution cars was ever used by the factory in racing. All of the Factory cars were built up from the 1983 DL body shells because they had no sunroof and were built in Sweden, so they were readily available and relatively cheap. Aside from the flat hoods not otherwise seen on North American 240s the Evolutions also received numerous and substantial performance and suspension upgrades ranging from larger radiators and intercoolers to water injection and large rear spoilers.
* 240 SE (1991–1993): Late, runout edition for certain markets, only for 1991 in the United States. Typically with GL or GLT interior trim but without the performance and handling modifications. Usual equipment was ABS, power mirrors, central locking, tachometer, 14&quot; &quot;Scorpius&quot; alloy rims, all-black grille and trim. Roof rails on wagon model.
*Police (1981–1985): A special edition 240 aimed at the Swedish police, but also made in right-hand-drive form and used by some British constabularies. It was effectively a 240GLT with vinyl, rather than cloth, trim, steel wheels and no sunroof.
* 240 Polar (1991–1993) – Austerely equipped entry level version for certain European markets such as Italy (1991), Belgium and the Netherlands (1992–1993). Italian spec. always, BeNeLux spec. very often with the &quot;B200F&quot; engine (instead of the &quot;B230F&quot;). Cloth interior instead of tricot plush on &quot;GL&quot;-badged vehicles. Another Polar version was earlier (1986) available in the German market.
* 240 Super Polar – 1992–1993 Italy-only model. Well-equipped version with black leather upholstery, power windows all around, air conditioning, and cross-spoke aluminium wheels. Three different metallic paints to choose between, all-black trim instead of chrome. Only available with the &quot;B200F&quot; engine. There was also some Rare Wagon only Super Polars equipped with special side graphics, full car width front Bullbar and steel grilles over the rear tail lights. 
* 240 Classic (1992–93): European markets from the 1992 model year; Swiss market cars were fitted with the B230FX engine. For the North American market, only 1,600 were produced in April and May 1993, half wagons and half sedans. European Classics have fully equipped interior with wood dash trim and &quot;Classic&quot; badges on hatch/deck lid. In addition to the European equipment, the 1,600 North American Classics have body-matched painted grilles and side mirrors, special 14&quot; alloy wheels, production-number plaque on the dash, and special paint colors — ruby red or metallic dark teal green.
* Limited – (1993); very similar to the Classic, but not numbered and with a brass plaque instead.
* 240 GL (1992): North American market. Slightly different from the early 1975–1989 GL model, more like the 1993 Classic and the 1991 SE model. Only available in 244 sedan body style.
* 240 Torslanda (1992–1993) – Station wagons only, these cars can be identified by &quot;Tørslanda badging&quot; (a deliberate, Scandinavian-looking misspelling of the town where they were built), tinted windows, plastic exterior trim, multi-spoke 15&quot; alloy wheels, and full-length body striping above the rocker panels. Three body colours were available, either red, white, or silver. Simply equipped, the only features were heated front seats, power steering and the standard heating systems. The Torslanda was sold in Great Britain as a limited run special edition to mark the rundown of 240 production.
* 240 family edition: Entry level cars for the German market from 1990 to 1993. Simplified interior with cloth upholstery (instead of tricot plush on &quot;GL&quot;-models). No heated front seats as standard but all equipped with headlamp wipers and fixed black roof rails. No sedans. Shipped with petrol-fired &quot;B230F&quot; engine or &quot;D24&quot; diesel engine. All badged &quot;240&quot;.
* 240 Tack: Limited edition in 1992–93 to phase out the 240 series in Japan; &quot;tack&quot; means &quot;thank you&quot; in Swedish. Tricot plush trim, five body paintings to choose. Sedans and estates. All units with &quot;B230F&quot; engine. At the same time a more upmarket limited edition badged &quot;Classic&quot; was offered. Same five paintings as &quot;Tack&quot; available, but shipped with black leather upholstery, wood trim on the dash board and &quot;Corona&quot; alloy wheels. Also engine &quot;B230F&quot;. Sedans and estates as well.

=== Anniversary special editions ===

* 244 DL Anniversary (1977): Volvo released this model to celebrate its fiftieth anniversary. Based on the 244DL, the anniversary car was finished in metallic silver with a black and gold band around the waistline. Around 50 were sold in ten different countries, taking the total number produced up to 500.
* 264 Anniversary (1977) Volvo released this model to celebrate its fiftieth anniversary. Based on the 264, the anniversary car was finished in metallic silver with a black and gold band around the waistline. Numbers produced unknown.
* 240 DL Jubileum (1987): Volvo released this model to celebrate its sixtieth anniversary. Like the fiftieth anniversary edition, it was based on the 240 DL series, only this time it was available as both a saloon and an estate.
* 244 Thor (1979–80) Around 300 were produced for the UK market and this spec lay somewhere near the GLE spec. Noticeable extras fitted as standard were, metallic black paint, premium stereo, auto box, black cloth seats, front electric windows and corona alloy wheels and fuel injection. Noticeable exclusions for a limited edition premium model were, power steering, electric rear windows and air conditioning.

== Concept models ==
Volvo produced a prototype for a hatchback version in 1975, badged the &quot;Volvo 263 GL&quot;, but it was not chosen for mass production and is now on display in the Volvo World Museum in Gothenburg, Sweden.

Volvo also produced a prototype in 1978 called the &quot;242 GTC Turbo&quot;, which had roof pillars similar to that of a 262 C, and a body design of a 242 GT. It also came with striping on the sides, close to the bottom of the car with the word &quot;turbo&quot; on it to make it seem lower than it actually was. It was originally planned to have two engine choices, a 16 valve I4 engine (made for racing), and a turbocharged version of the &quot;B21 Redblock&quot; I4 engine which was under construction.

==240 in motorsport==
Despite its non-sporting image, the Volvo 240 was a successful competitor in touring car racing in the 1980s. In 1983 Volvo produced 505 evolution version of the 240 Turbo with a larger turbocharger and other performance modifications. All of these special cars were exported to the United States with the special equipment kit in the trunk of each car. 270 of these cars were retrofitted with the special equipment at Long Beach and further 240s were simultaneously fitted with the same kit on the East Coast at the Volvo Penta facility at Chesapeake Bay. All 500, except for one car which was returned to Sweden, were subsequently stripped of their GpA homologation equipment and sold as standard road cars. This was allowed under the Group A regulations, the cars only having to have been made and not necessarily sold. Nevertheless, it did lead to protests from other teams, until Volvo was able to produce proof that the 500 cars had indeed been manufactured.

Nevertheless, the 240 Turbo proved a successful competitor, and in 1984 won the Zolder round of the European Touring Car Championship. In Group A racing form, the 240T weighed , and its turbocharged 2.1-liter engine produced approximately . Although it was a big car and lacked the agility of some of its competitors, and despite its boxy, un-aerodynamic appearance, it was fast in a straight line (approximately on faster circuits such as Monza, Hockenheim and Bathurst) and proved to be reliable. Volvo Motor Sport, VMS, did not run the cars directly, instead contracting the services of established teams to prepare and manage them, with technical assistance from VMS.

The Eggenberger Motorsport team was the most successful of these. Late in the 1984 European Touring Car Championship, Swedish team Sportpromotion won the EG Trophy race at Zolder circuit and followed that with second in the 500 km del Mugello. In 1985, Volvo signed Swiss engine guru Ruedi Eggenberger to run its works team. Eggenberger Motorsport, with team drivers Gianfranco Brancatelli and Thomas Lindström, won the 1985 ETCC outright, seeing off challenges from BMW (Schnitzer), and defending ETCC champions TWR who were running the V8-engined Rover Vitesse rather than the V12 Jaguar XJS that had dominated 1984 after Jaguar had decided to concentrate on sports car racing.

Eggenberger moved to race Ford Sierras in 1986 and Volvo contracted Belgian based team RAS Sport to be its factory &quot;works&quot; team in the ETCC, with defending champion Lindström being joined by ex-Formula One and Grand Prix motorcycle racer Johnny Cecotto, as well as Ulf Granberg and Anders Olofsson in the second car. The team was competitive in 1986, taking wins at Hockenheim, Anderstorp, Brno, Österreichring and Zolder. However, the wins at Anderstorp and the Österreichring were taken away from the team due to illegal fuel. The disqualifications would see Lindström unable to defend his title, and Volvo AB quit GpA racing.

Around the world, other teams were also running the Volvo 240T with fair degrees of success. New Zealand business man and racer Mark Petch had purchased an ex GTM Team car directly from VMS 240T and with drivers Robbie Francevic and Michel Delcourt won the Wellington 500 street race in New Zealand in January 1985 after starting from the rear of the grid due to the car not arriving in time to qualify. MPM, Mark Petch Motorsport took the car to Australia with financial assistance from Volvo Australia. Francevic then went on to finish 5th in the 1985 Australian Touring Car Championship (the first ATCC to be run under Group A rules), taking out right wins at Symmons Plains and Oran Park. Thomas Lindström joined Francevic to drive in the 1986 Wellington 500 and brought with him from Europe the latest engine and suspension upgrades for the car. Petch with the help of Bob Atkins, head of The Australian Volvo Dealer Council, formed the AVDT, Australian Volvo Dealer Team who purchased Petch&#x27;s car and spares immediately following MPM&#x27;s second back to back win at the opening two round of the 1986 ATCC. The Volvo Dealer Team expanded to two cars, for the fourth round of the ATCC at Adelaide with the new car RHD car, ex RAS, being for dual Australian Single Seater Drivers&#x27; Champion John Bowe who had driven with Francevic at the 1985 Bathurst 1000. Francevic won the 1986 Australian Touring Car Championship the first and only time that the title had been won by a Volvo driver and the first time since its inception in 1960 that it had been won with a car powered by a turbocharged engine. Volvo GpA cars also won the Guia Race in Macau consecutively in 1985 and 1986.

The Volvo 240 Turbo won the 24 Hours of Zolder in 1987 and 1990.

Volvo withdrew from the sport at the end of the 1986 season, partly because of the RAS team being found guilty of using non-approved race fuel, but primarily because the 240T had achieved what it set out to do. Volvo did not return to touring car racing until the advent of Super Touring racing in the early 1990s, with the 850 model.

The 240 also enjoyed some success in other branches of motorsport. Although Volvo had pulled out of rallying in the early 1970s, the 240 Turbo did see action as a Group A rally car in the mid-1980s, but without works backing it met with only limited success. The normally aspirated version remained eligible for international competition until 1996, and to this day the 240 remains a popular clubman&#x27;s rally car in Scandinavia. Its popularity has in recent years been boosted with the establishment of the Volvo Original Cup, or VOC. This is a championship for amateur rally drivers using Volvo 240s, 740s and 940s. In the interests of cost control, only very limited modifications are allowed to the cars. The series attracts large numbers of competitors, attracted by its low cost and by the Volvo&#x27;s rear-drive handling and reliability.

Because it is cheap and robust, the 240 has also become very common in folkrace competitions. In the UK the 240 is popular for banger racing, due to its strength. The Volvo 240 is now a common choice alongside Ford Granadas and Jaguars for using at unlimited banger meetings. In the United States, 240s regularly appear in low-budget endurance racing series such as 24 Hours of LeMons, where the 240 reliability, durability, and easy parts availability are appreciated.

<text>Zinzan Valentine Brooke (born Murray Zinzan Brooke on 14 February 1965) is a former New Zealand rugby union footballer who played at number eight.

Brooke played 58 tests for New Zealand, and 42 non-international matches for the All Blacks. He captained Auckland Blues to Super 12 championships in 1996 and 1997 and was an influential figure in Auckland&#x27;s dominance in the National Provincial Championship during the late 1980s and 1990s. He scored 17 tries in test matches, then a world record for a forward. He also played for New Zealand Māori.

==Rugby career==
Brooke was a founding player of the Southerners Sports Club (Bangkok), playing in the inaugural side in 1994 against Taradale RFC. In 1995 he published his autobiography &quot;Zinny: The Zinzan Brooke story&quot;, written with Alex Veysey.

Brooke is considered one of the best number eights to have ever played for the All Blacks. He had the running and kicking skills of a backline player which made him extremely mobile and agile as a forward. He once kicked a 48-metre drop goal during a 1995 Rugby World Cup match, one of three he scored in test matches.

In the 1997 New Year Honours, Brooke was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to rugby.

Brooke scored his third drop goal during the All Blacks&#x27; impressive 42–7 win against Wales at Wembley Stadium on 29 November 1997, giving him the rare distinction of being the only rugby player to have &quot;scored a goal at Wembley&quot;. He also set up a try for Christian Cullen.

In 2007, former England centre and captain Will Carling published his list of the &#x27;50 Greatest Rugby players&#x27; in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, and ranked Brooke the ninth greatest player of all time, stating: &quot;For a forward his skills were outrageous. As comfortable playing sevens as 15s, he had better kicking and handling skills than some fly-halves playing international rugby. You align that with his strength and ability as a forward to read the game – he was unique.&quot;

==Retirement==
In 1997 he retired from international rugby union and moved to England to play for Harlequins, and later coach it. During the 2002/03 season he played for Coventry in National Division One. He now plays amateur rugby union for Windsor Rugby Club in Berkshire, England.

In 2011, while back in New Zealand for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, Brooke was inducted into the TVNZ This Is Your Life wall of fame. His family joined him from England at the Auckland Viaduct for the live show. Special guests included his four brothers, Buck Shelford and Michael Jones.

Brooke ran Frances Lodge, a boutique bed and breakfast in Windsor, Berkshire, with his wife. However, it closed when both Brooke and his wife were declared bankrupt in the UK in August 2012.

Brooke suffered head trauma in May 2007 while falling out of a taxi in the Spanish town of Elche, though the circumstances are unclear.

During the COVID-19 outbreak, Brooke began advocating online against the use of face masks and posting support for alternative treatments such as Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine. These claims were criticised by New Zealand scientists such as Michael Baker and Siouxsie Wiles calling on Brooke to engage with scientists and to seek out &quot;reputable sources&quot;.

==Name and family==
Zinzan Brooke&#x27;s unusual first name has a long history in the Brooke family, though its origins are uncertain. It has been suggested that it may be an anglicised Italian or Albanian name. The name links Brooke&#x27;s family with another notable New Zealand sporting family, that of cricketer Zin Harris (full name Parke Gerald Zinzan Harris) and his sons Chris Zinzan Harris and Ben Zinzan Harris, all of whom are distant relatives of the Brookes.

He has two other brothers who also played rugby at representative level: Marty, who played for Auckland and Southland; and Robin, who played lock for Auckland and New Zealand.

Brooke is a member of the Ngāpuhi iwi.

His son Lucas Brooke is also a rugby union player in England.

<text>Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. () is an Israeli defense technology company. It was founded as Israel&#x27;s National R&amp;D Defense Laboratory for the development of weapons and military technology within the Israeli Ministry of Defense; in 2002 it was incorporated as a limited company.

==History==


Rafael was established in 1948 as the Science Corps (, known by the acronym HEMED, ) under the leadership of Shlomo Gur. It was renamed the Research and Design Directorate () in 1952. In 1952 David Ben-Gurion decided to split the activities of HEMED into two agencies. The pure scientific research was left with HEMED, while the development of weapons was placed into the new EMET agency.

In 1954 Ben-Gurion decided to change the name of EMET to &quot;RAFAEL&quot; (). It was reorganized as Rafael in 1958.

In 1995, Yitzhak Rabin asked Amos Horev to become chairman of the board of Rafael, following many years in which Horev had served as chairman of Rafael&#x27;s advisory committee. Horev served as chairman until January 2001.

===Restructuring as a limited company===
During the early 1990s Rafael was operating at a loss (peaking in 1995, with a loss of $120 million on a turnover of $460 million). Therefore, it was decided to restructure the organization and start operating Rafael as a company. Initially the new company had three discrete divisions, each operating as a profit center, with a separate balance sheet presented to the newly formed management board.

The restructuring was completed in 2002 when Rafael was formally incorporated as a limited company (although still as a government-owned corporation), while maintaining its technological capabilities through an investment of about 10% of turnover in R&amp;D programs. In its first year as a limited company, Rafael earned a $37 million profit on $830 million in sales. By 2016, Rafael reported annual net profits of 473 million ILS (roughly 130 million dollars), up 3%, compared with ILS 459 million in 2015. New orders in 2016 totaled ILS 10.7 billion, and sales amounted to ILS 8.32 billion, 6% more than in 2015. The company&#x27;s orders backlog as of the end of 2016 was ILS 21.72 billion, 12% more than at the end of 2015.

On October 14, 2007, the company changed its name from Rafael Armament Development Authority Ltd. to Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd.

==Civilian technology transfer==
In 1993, Rafael Development Corporation (RDC), a technology transfer company, was established as a joint venture with Elron Electronic Industries; in order to commercialize applications based on defense technologies for medical devices, telecommunications, and semiconductor industries. The company established and developed several companies including:

<doc id="740731" wikidata="Q6924252" url="?curid=740731" title="Mount Umunhum">
<text>Mount Umunhum ( ) is a peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains, located in Santa Clara County, California. It is the fourth-highest peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains, after Loma Prieta, Crystal Peak, and Mount Chual. Most of the mountain is located within the Sierra Azul Open Space Preserve.

==Geology==
Mount Umunhum consists of a geologic formation that is known as the &quot;Coast Range Ophiolite.&quot; This ophiolite is a piece of Middle Jurassic oceanic crust and mantle that has been obducted onto land and largely been converted to serpentinite. It has been extensively faulted and diapirically uplifted and eroded to form Mt. Umunhum and extensive outcrop areas throughout the Santa Cruz Mountain foothills and elsewhere. The Coast Range Ophiolite is also known to underlie the rocks of the Great Valley throughout central California. The exposure on the northeast face of Mt. Umunhum is one of the best Bay Area exposures of the Coast Range Ophiolite.

Mount Umunhum and nearby Loma Prieta are pushed upward by local collision forces associated with a left bend in the San Andreas Fault. Starting near Uvas Canyon, the fault stops trending northwest but instead bends west-northwest for about eight miles before continuing its northwest direction. This left bend is renowned among geologists as an archetypal restraining bend which acts to oppose strike-slip motion along the fault. From the perspective of Mount Umunhum and other mountains atop the Sierra Azul block, the Pacific Plate is trying to shear them off the North American Plate but can&#x27;t break them off. Rather, the resulting transpression force pushes up the local terrain and helps explain why these are the highest peaks in the Santa Cruz Mountains.

==History==
Mount Umunhum is from Ohlone and means &quot;Resting Place of the Hummingbird&quot;.

The Cube, a radar tower which housed an 85.5-ton AN/FPS-24 radar, was completed in 1962 and used to watch for hostile aircraft during the Cold War. Its signal caused electronic interference in many radio, TV and sound systems within its 250-mile range on each rotation.

The summit was closed to the public due to hazardous materials and unsafe conditions caused by partially demolished structures from the former Air Force station. Plans were made to clean it up and restore it for public use. &quot;In 2009, with federal funding, Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District removed 3,000 cubic yards of hazardous materials, including lead paint, asbestos, fuel storage containers and PCB transformers; and deconstructed 13,680 tons of concrete, asphalt, wood and other materials.&quot; Despite these measures access to the summit area surrounding the cube was closed again in 2018 pending additional cleanup. The demolition of the cube was considered, but in May 2016, the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors listed it on the County Heritage Resource Inventory, giving it official historic status and protecting it from demolition. On September 18, 2017, the road, a mountain biking and hiking trail to the summit were opened. Facilities include new pavement, restrooms, interpretive displays and a small parking lot at the summit. It is a spur of the Bay Area Ridge Trail.

In 2017, the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District granted an easement to the tribal band, descendants of the Ohlone Native American people who inhabited the region before it was settled by Europeans. The easement authorized the band to build a garden and hold ceremonies on the mountaintop.

In March 2022, the $2 million renovation project to preserve the historical building was completed.

==Facilities==
The mountain is topped by an eight and a half story (84.5 feet tall) concrete radar tower (5 floors interior), known locally as &quot;the Cube&quot; or &quot;the Box&quot;. The tower was part of Almaden Air Force Station, a radar surveillance post which operated from 1958 to 1980.

The mountain is also the site of the Bay Area NEXRAD weather radar. The high elevation is necessary for line of sight in the region&#x27;s varied terrain, but it also limits the ability to detect storms with bases lower in the atmosphere.

<doc id="740732" wikidata="Q6665803" url="?curid=740732" title="Locks and weirs on the River Thames">
<text>The English River Thames is navigable from Cricklade (for very small, shallow boats) or Lechlade (for larger boats) to the sea, and this part of the river falls 71 meters (234 feet). There are 45 locks on the river, each with one or more adjacent weirs. These lock and weir combinations are used for controlling the flow of water down the river, most notably when there is a risk of flooding, and provide for navigation above the tideway.

==History==
From ancient times there were many obstructions across the Thames, for fish-pounds and millers&#x27; weirs. They are referred to by Asserius Menevensis in the ninth century and Magna Carta (1215) states that &quot;weirs, for the time to come, shall be demolished in the Thames and Medway, except on the sea coast.&quot; It appears this never happened. In the Middle Ages, the fall on the river in its middle and upper sections was used to drive watermills for the production of flour and paper and various other purposes such as metal-beating. This involved the construction of weirs in order to divert water into the mills. The weirs, however, presented an obstacle to navigation and to solve this problem locks were built alongside the weirs to enable boats to be moved between levels.

Originally these were flash locks that were essentially removable sections of weir. A boat moving downstream would wait above the lock until the lock was opened, which would allow a &quot;flash&quot; of water to pass through, carrying the boat with it. In the opposite direction boats would be winched or towed through the open lock. The difficulty of using flash locks, and the consequent loss of water and income to the miller, eventually led to their replacement with pound locks. Locks similar to these early pound locks still exist on the river, although in many cases they have been enlarged and mechanised.

On the lower section, the river was tidal as far as Staines until the beginning of the 19th century and was under the control of the City of London. The City&#x27;s jurisdiction was marked by the London Stone. The principle of lock/weir combination, which maintained the depth of water for navigation and reduced the danger of flooding, was extended over the tidal section as far as Teddington in a series of locks built after 1810.

The first authority charged with managing navigation and lock building was the Oxford-Burcot Commission, which built the locks at Iffley and Sandford below Oxford in 1633 and at Swift Ditch near Abingdon. In 1751, the Thames Navigation Commissioners were established and built eight locks between Shiplake Lock and Boulters lock between 1770 and 1773. The opening of the Thames and Severn Canal from Lechlade in 1789 led to the building of many of the locks upstream of Shiplake. The six locks built by the City of London Corporation on the tidal section below Staines between 1811 and 1815 required individual Acts of Parliament, and the Thames Conservancy took over their management from the City in 1857. In 1866 the Thames Conservancy became responsible for all river management and installed more locks over the years, the last being Eynsham and King’s in 1928. In 1908 an Act transferred responsibility for the Thames from a point below Teddington Lock to the Port of London Authority, and this included Richmond Lock. The Thames Conservancy was subsumed into the Thames Water Authority in 1974. With the privatization of water supply in 1990 the river management functions passed to the new National Rivers Authority and in 1996 to the Environment Agency. Only Richmond Lock remains under the jurisdiction of the Port of London Authority.

==Operation==

===Management===
From the head of navigation at Cricklade to the start of the tidal section at Teddington Lock, the river is managed by the Environment Agency, which has the twin responsibilities of managing the flow of water to control flooding and provide navigable water depths and also regulating and promoting navigation on the river. As a result, all the locks and weirs on the river, except the semi-tidal Richmond Lock, are owned and operated by the Environment Agency. Richmond Lock is managed by the Port of London Authority.

Most of the Environment Agency&#x27;s locks and weirs are staffed by a lock keeper, who often lives in a house adjacent to the lock. The lock keeper&#x27;s duties involve both operating the lock, and managing the river levels above the lock by adjusting the weir openings.

===Locks===
Most locks are operated by their keepers between 9 a.m. and 7 p.m. from June to August, with progressively shorter hours as the hours of daylight reduce, and they are not operated during the lock-keeper&#x27;s lunch hour between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. During the summer months Assistant Lock Keepers and volunteers are employed to deal with the heavy traffic and avoid the lunch-time closure. However Teddington Lock, which is the most downstream of the Environment Agency locks and separates the long Kingston reach of the non-tidal river from Hampton Court to the tideway, is staffed 24 hours a day. During winter, some locks will be closed for maintenance and the status has to be checked with the Environment Agency.

The locks at the upper end of the river, from St John&#x27;s Lock to King&#x27;s Lock, are manually operated. All other locks on the Thames are hydraulically operated. All locks, except Teddington, can be operated by boat crews outside manning hours, using the adapted system of &quot;public power&quot;, which allows boaters to use the hydraulic machinery at reduced power, except during the hours of darkness.

Locks are popular visitor attractions, and many serve refreshments. Locks were often built adjacent to islands and therefore many are situated in remote locations, hard to find and can only be reached on foot. Many locks also have moorings that can be used overnight, and some include electric charging points for electric powered boats.

All the locks have obvious access from the Thames Path, except for Whitchurch Lock which is within an island and only accessible by boat; Cookham Lock requires a 1km diversion from the Thames Path; and Marlow Lock requires a short diversion.

===Weirs===
The Environment Agency has the responsibility of managing the flow of water along the length of the river to prevent flooding on particular reaches and to maintain navigation depths. The volume and speed of water down the river is managed by adjusting the gates at each weir. Occasionally this can result in a fast stream rendering navigation more hazardous. These conditions are indicated by yellow or red warning boards on the lock gates and the status of all locks is published by the Agency. The Agency cannot legally stop navigation when the red boards are out, but continuing to travel is inadvisable and may invalidate a boater&#x27;s insurance.

Occasionally flooding is unavoidable, and the Agency issues Flood Warnings with three levels of severity - Flood Alert, Flood Warning, and Severe Flood Warning.

In recent years the Salmon Conservancy has been installing fish ladders at weirs to allow salmon to travel up river.

Today some weirs are often used recreationally by kayakers and canoeists for activities such as whitewater slalom and playboating. Specifically, Hambleden Weir and Boulter&#x27;s Weir have EA sanctioned modifications made to them for such use.

===Reaches===
The locks and weirs, in effect, break the river up into 44 lakes or lock reaches. Each lock controls the reach above it and thus identifies it. Each reach has its own character and points of interest.

Many reaches host regattas and other events and these are coordinated through a River User’s Group for the reach. The Environment Agency may close all or part of a reach for an event, but most regattas only require one side of the river which may then be closed off.

When the boats were horse drawn, a towpath was needed on the bank side. This towpath has formed the basis for the Thames Path which runs between the source and mouth of the river. The path runs between locks and is therefore often the main means of access on land. Where the towpath changes from one side of the river to the other ferries were once provided. These have now almost all disappeared and the Thames Path has to be diverted to the nearest bridge, often a considerable distance, to cope with this.

=== Foot crossings === 
All of the Thames locks have walkways on top of the lock gates, so except at Whitchurch Lock one can cross to the lock island from the adjacent bank. 
Upstream of Wallingford, many locks also have walkways on top of the weir to cross the whole river. Downstream of Wallingford,
Caversham Lock and Boulters Lock have footbridges nearby, and Hambleden Lock has a walkway on top of the weir, but the other locks below Wallingford do not allow river crossing on foot.

==List of locks and weirs==


The list of locks, weirs and ferries is given in upstream to downstream order, from source to sea. Most of the older flash locks have disappeared and there are only three ferries still operating (Weybridge, Hampton and Hammerton&#x27;s). Nearly all of the older weirs and most of the current ones once had associated mills, fifteen of which are mentioned in the Domesday book, but very few of these survive. A few weirs had bucks for catching eels.

Additionally, Blake&#x27;s Lock is located on a reach of the River Kennet that is administered by the Environment Agency as part of the River Thames, and is often counted as a Thames Lock. It is the only manual Thames lock below Oxford.

The tide flows as far as Teddington Lock: the weir at Richmond Lock is only used at low tide, to maintain the water level above it.

Chalmore Lock (1838) was removed in 1883.

<doc id="740734" wikidata="Q1911065" url="?curid=740734" title="Wall cloud">
<text>A wall cloud (murus or pedestal cloud) is a large, localized, persistent, and often abrupt lowering of cloud that develops beneath the surrounding base of a cumulonimbus cloud and from which tornadoes sometimes form. It is typically beneath the rain-free base (RFB) portion of a thunderstorm, and indicates the area of the strongest updraft within a storm. Rotating wall clouds are an indication of a mesocyclone in a thunderstorm; most strong tornadoes form from these. Many wall clouds do rotate; however, some do not.

== Genesis ==

Wall clouds are formed by a process known as entrainment, when an inflow of warm, moist air rises and converges, overpowering wet, rain-cooled air from the normally downwind downdraft. As the warm air continues to entrain the cooler air, the air temperature drops, and the dew point increases (thus the dew point depression decreases). As this air continues to rise, it becomes more saturated with moisture, which results in additional cloud condensation, sometimes in the form of a wall cloud. Wall clouds may form as a descending of the cloud base or may form as rising scud comes together and connects to the storm&#x27;s cloud base.

== Structure ==
Wall clouds can be anywhere from a fraction of wide to over across. Wall clouds form in the inflow region, on the side of the storm coinciding with the direction of the steering winds (deep layer winds through the height of the storm). In the Northern Hemisphere wall clouds typically form at the south or southwest end of a supercell. This is in the rear of the supercell near the main updraft and most supercells move in a direction with northeasterly components, for supercells forming in northwest flow situations and moving southeastward, the wall cloud may be found on the northwest or back side of such storms. Rotating wall clouds are visual evidence of a mesocyclone.

=== Associated features ===

Some wall clouds have a feature similar to an &quot;eye&quot;, as in a mesoscale convective vortex.

Attached to many wall clouds, especially in moist environments, is a cauda (tail cloud), a tail-like band of cloud extending from the wall cloud toward the precipitation core. It can be thought of as an extension of the wall cloud in that the tail cloud is connected to the wall cloud and condensation forms for a similar reason. Cloud elements may be seen to be moving into the wall cloud, as it is also an inflow feature. Most movement is horizontal, but some rising motion is also often apparent at the junction between the tail cloud and the wall cloud.

Some wall clouds also have a band of cloud fragments encircling the top of the wall cloud where it meets the ambient cloud base; this feature is a collar cloud.

Another accessory cloud is the flumen, commonly known as the beaver&#x27;s tail. It is formed by the warm, humid inflow of a strong thunderstorm, and is often mistaken for tornadoes. Although the presence of a flumen is associated with tornado risk, the flumen does not rotate.

=== Wall cloud vs. shelf cloud ===

Many storms contain shelf clouds, which are often mistaken for wall clouds since an approaching shelf cloud appears to form a wall made of clouds and may contain turbulent motions. Wall clouds are inflow clouds and tend to slope inward, or toward the precipitation area of a storm. Shelf clouds, on the other hand, are outflow clouds that jut outward from the storm, often as gust fronts. Also, shelf clouds tend to move outward away from the precipitation area of a storm.

Shelf clouds most often appear on the leading edge of a thunderstorm as they are formed by condensation from the cool outflow of the storm that lifts warmer air in the ambient environment (at the outflow boundary). When present in a supercell thunderstorm these shelf clouds on the leading edge of a storm are associated with the forward flank downdraft (FFD). Shelf clouds in supercells also form with the rear flank downdraft (RFD), although these tend to be more transitory and smaller than shelf clouds on the forward side of a storm. A wall cloud will usually be at the rear of the storm, though small, rotating wall clouds (a feature of a mesovortex) can occur within the leading edge (typically of a quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) or squall line) on rare occasion. 
== Supercell and tornado significance ==
The wall cloud feature was first identified by Ted Fujita and as associated with tornadoes in tornadic storms following a detailed site investigation of the 1957 Fargo tornado. In the special case of a supercell thunderstorm, but also occasionally with intense multicellular thunderstorms such as the QLCS above, the wall cloud will often be seen to be rotating. A rotating wall cloud is the area of the thunderstorm that is most likely to produce tornadoes, and the vast majority of intense tornadoes.

Tornadogenesis is most likely when the wall cloud is persistent with rapid ascent and rotation. The wall cloud typically precedes tornadogenesis by ten to twenty minutes but may be as little as one minute or more than an hour. Often, the degree of ascent and rotation increase markedly shortly before tornadogenesis, and sometimes the wall cloud will descend and &quot;bulk&quot; or &quot;tighten&quot;. Tornadic wall clouds tend to have strong, persistent, and warm inflow air. This should be sensible at the surface if one is in the inflow region; in the Northern Hemisphere, this is typically to the south and southeast of the wall cloud. Large tornadoes tend to come from larger, lower-wall clouds closer to the back of the rain curtain (providing less visual warning time to those in the path of an organized storm).

Although it is rotating wall clouds that contain most strong tornadoes, many rotating wall clouds do not produce tornadoes. Absent the co-position of a low-level boundary with an updraft, tornadoes very rarely occur without a sufficiently buoyant rear flank downdraft (RFD), which usually manifests itself visually as a drying out of clouds, called a clear slot or notch. The RFD initiates the tornado, occludes around the mesocyclone, and when it wraps completely around, cuts off the inflow causing death of the low-level mesocyclone (or &quot;tornado cyclone&quot;) and tornadolysis. Therefore, in most cases, the RFD is responsible for both the birth and the death of a tornado.

Usually, but not always, the dry slot occlusion is visible (assuming one&#x27;s line of sight is not blocked by precipitation) throughout the tornado life cycle. The wall cloud withers and will often be gone by the time the tornado dissipates. If conditions are favorable, then, often even before the original tornado lifts, another wall cloud and occasionally a new tornado may form downwind of the old wall cloud, typically to the east or the southeast in the Northern Hemisphere (east or northeast in the Southern Hemisphere). This process is known as cyclic tornadogenesis and the resulting series of tornadoes as a tornado family.

The rotation of wall clouds is usually cyclonic; anticyclonic wall clouds may occur with anti-mesocyclones or with mesovortices on the leading edge of a QLCS (Again, this relationship is reversed in the Southern Hemisphere).

== Other usages of the term ==
The dense cumulonimbus cloud cover of the eyewall of an intense tropical cyclone may also be referred to as a wall cloud or eyewall cloud.

<text>The Oxford Book of Contemporary Verse, edited by D. J. Enright, is a poetry anthology from 1980, published by Oxford University Press. It might be considered one of the &quot;last words&quot; from a founder-member of The Movement, with its comments in the Introduction still in an anti-romantic vein, and that &quot;the editor remains unpersuaded that wit is necessarily evasive in some shabby way or emotionally lowering&quot;. It was reissued in 1995 under the title Oxford Book of Verse 1945–1980 ().

<text>LCC (&quot;Local C Compiler&quot; or &quot;Little C Compiler&quot;) is a small, retargetable compiler for the ANSI C programming language. Although its source code is available at no charge for personal use, it is not open-source or free software according to the usual definitions because products derived from LCC may not be sold, although components not derived from LCC may be sold. It was developed by Chris Fraser and David Hanson.

==LCC==

LCC is intended to be very simple to understand and is well-documented; its design is described in Fraser and Hanson&#x27;s book &quot;A Retargetable C Compiler: Design and Implementation&quot;. The book includes most of the source code for version 3.6 of the compiler, which was written as a literate program using noweb. As of July 2011 the current version of LCC is 4.2, but much of the book still applies to this version. The major change since the book was published is in the code-generator interface, which is described in a separate document.

The source code for LCC is around 20,000 lines, which is much smaller than many major compilers.

LCC can generate code for several processor architectures, including Alpha, SPARC, MIPS, and x86; there is also an LCC backend that generates Microsoft&#x27;s Common Intermediate Language.

==Projects incorporating LCC==

===Quake 3 ===

id Software&#x27;s id Tech 3 engine relies on a modified version of LCC to compile the source code of each game module or third-party mod into bytecode targeting its virtual machine. This means that modules are oblivious to the system beyond the system calls and limited file system scope offered by the engine, which is intended to reduce the threat posed by malicious mod authors. Another consideration is that games and mods written for the engine are portable without recompilation; only the virtual machine needs to be ported to new platforms in order to execute the modules.

===lcc-win===

lcc-win32 is an integrated development environment package for Microsoft Windows which includes a fork of LCC. An amd64 counterpart named lcc-win64 exists, which has been available since April 15, 2012.

===Pelles C===

Pelles C&#x27;s compiler is a heavily modified version of LCC providing C11 as well as C17 support, amd64 support, additional optimisation techniques such as inline expansion and an IDE.

===MathWorks===
For 32-bit Windows machines, Lcc is used as a default if no other compiler is installed for MathWorks MATLAB and related products.

== License ==

LCC is free for personal use and may be redistributed provided all distribution media and product documentation acknowledges it. The LCC license relies on examples in multiple cases. LCC may not be sold for profit, but it may be included with other software that is sold for profit, provided LCC itself is distributed for free. Per user and unlimited use licenses are available by contacting Addison-Wesley, in particular for compilers of languages such as C++ for which a C compiler may constitute much of its work.

<doc id="740742" wikidata="Q1664208" url="?curid=740742" title="Underground power station">
<text>An underground power station is a type of hydroelectric power station constructed by excavating the major components (e.g. machine hall, penstocks, and tailrace) from rock, rather than the more common surface-based construction methods.

One or more conditions impact whether a power station is constructed underground. The terrain or geology around a dam is taken into consideration, as gorges or steep valleys may not accommodate a surface power station. A power station within bedrock may be less expensive to construct than a surface power station on loose soil. Avalanche-prone valleys often make a surface station unfeasible as well. After World War II, large hydroelectric power stations were placed underground more often in order to protect them from airstrikes.

Often underground power stations form part of pumped storage hydroelectricity schemes, whose basic function is to level load: they use cheap or surplus off-peak power to pump water from a lower lake to an upper lake. During peak periods (when electricity prices are often high), the power station generates power from the water held in the upper lake.

==Notable examples==
Some notable underground power stations are:

*Kazunogawa Power Station is a 1,200 MW underground pumped storage plant in Japan. Kazunogawa consists of four 400 MW generation units. The cavern for the underground power station is below the surface. It is long by high and wide. The head is .
*Churchill Falls Generating Station, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada is the second largest underground power station in the world. It generates 5,428 MW from 11 turbines. The powerhouse is long, high, wide and located underground. The two tailrace tunnels are 1691.64 m long. The net head is 312.42 m.
*Kannagawa Hydropower Plant is a pumped-storage hydroelectric power plant near Minamiaiki in Nagano Prefecture and Ueno in Gunma Prefecture, Japan. The power house is underground and measures long, wide, and high. It contains 6 x 470 MW pump generators for a total capacity of 2,820 MW with an effective hydraulic head of and maximum discharge of . The first unit commenced operations in 2005, the second in 2012.
*Goldisthal Pumped Storage Station, in Thuringia, Germany, built in 1991-2004, generates 1,060 MW from 4 turbines. It is unique (for its scale) in Europe, in that two of the four motor generators are designed as variable speed asynchronous machines. The machine hall is long, high, wide, with a separate transformer cavern ( long, high, wide).
*Manapouri Power Station, Fiordland, New Zealand, built 1963-1972, generates 850 MW from 7 turbines. It is built underground, and has two 10 km tailrace tunnels. The net head is . The most notable feature of this station is that the lake and power station are located on the eastern side of the Southern Alps, with the tailrace tunnels traveling under a major mountain range, discharging in Doubtful Sound on the west coast.
*Boundary Dam Powerhouse, in Pend Oreille County, Washington, United States, completed in 1967 and diverting the Pend Oreille River through six units, Boundary Powerhouse produces 1070 MW. Owned and operated by Seattle City Light.
*Chaira Hydro Power Plant, Bulgaria, is the largest underground power station in the Balkans, built from 1980 to 1998. It has an installed capacity of 864 MW from four 216 MW reversible Francis turbines with a net rated head of , and maximal speed of 600 rpm.
*Cruachan Dam, United Kingdom, built in the early 1960s, a pumped storage plant generating 440 MW from 4 turbines.
*Dinorwig Power Station, Llanberis, United Kingdom, built in 1984, is a pumped-storage system, delivering 1,650 MW to Wales and the north-west of England. It stands in Europe&#x27;s largest man-made cavern.
* Edward Hyatt Power Plant inside the Oroville Dam, United States, is in a cavern carved into the bedrock of the Feather River canyon. It houses 3 Generator and 3 Pump/Generator units and their respective Transformers below the crest of the dam.
*Kariba hydro-electric power scheme (1,200 MW) is on the Zambezi river, which forms the border between Zimbabwe and Zambia. The Kariba system comprises two underground power stations. The Kariba South station in Zimbabwe houses six 100 MW generators. The Kariba North station in Zambia houses four 150 MW generators.
*Paulo Afonso Hydroelectric Complex, Brazil; The combined 4,279.6 Paulo Afonso I, II and III were built underground. Completed in 1955, PA I was Brazil&#x27;s first underground power station.
*Poatina Hydroelectric Power Station, Tasmania, Australia, built in 1966-1977 it generates 300 MW with water provided by the Great Lake, it is the largest underground power station in Australia.
*Raccoon Mountain Pumped-Storage Plant, Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States, built in 1970-1978 generates 1,530 MW. It is an early test of the pumped-storage approach.
*Robert-Bourassa generating station, Quebec, Canada, is the largest underground power station in the world. It generates 5,616 MW from 16 turbines with a net rated head of .
*Snoqualmie Falls Hydroelectric Plant in King County, Washington, United States, built in two stages, Plant 1, completed in 1899 was the world&#x27;s first completely underground power station and is still used to provide power to the Seattle area. The two power houses have a combined installed capacity of 53.9 MW.

<text>Peter Pan is a 2003 fantasy adventure film directed by P. J. Hogan and written by Hogan and Michael Goldenberg. The screenplay is based on the 1904 play and 1911 novel &quot;Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn&#x27;t Grow Up&quot; by J.M. Barrie. Jason Isaacs plays the dual roles of Captain Hook and George Darling, Olivia Williams plays Mary Darling, while Jeremy Sumpter plays Peter Pan, Rachel Hurd-Wood plays Wendy Darling, and Ludivine Sagnier plays Tinker Bell. Lynn Redgrave plays a supporting role as Aunt Millicent, a new character created for the film.

After completing the script, Hogan and Goldenberg were given approval by Great Ormond Street Hospital, which held the rights to Barrie&#x27;s story. Principal photography took place in Australia at Village Roadshow Studios on the Gold Coast, Queensland from September 2002 to May 2003.

&quot;Peter Pan&quot; premiered at the Empire in Leicester Square, London on December 9, 2003, and was theatrically released by Universal Pictures, Columbia Pictures, and Revolution Studios in the United Kingdom on December 24, 2003, and in the United States on December 25, 2003. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the performances (particularly those of Sumpter, Hurd-Wood, and Isaacs), visuals, romantic feel, and James Newton Howard&#x27;s musical score. However, it was a financial failure, grossing $122 million worldwide, against an estimated budget of $130 million.

==Plot==

In Edwardian London, Wendy Darling tells her younger brothers John and Michael stories of Captain Hook and his pirates. Peter Pan overhears her from outside their nursery window. Dissatisfied with Wendy&#x27;s stories, Aunt Millicent advises the Darlings to focus on her future prospects. One night, Wendy sees Peter return to the nursery to watch her sleep, but his shadow is bitten off by the family&#x27;s nurse dog, Nana. At school, Wendy&#x27;s teacher discovers her drawing a picture of Peter. Attempting to intercept a disciplinary letter meant for her father, Wendy inadvertently embarrasses him when Nana the St. Bernard chases her at the local bank.

In search of his shadow, Peter befriends Wendy, who sews it back onto him. He invites Wendy and her brothers to Neverland so she can tell her stories to his gang of Lost Boys. Using Tinker Bell&#x27;s fairy dust, the four fly to Neverland, while Nana alerts Mr. and Mrs. Darling of what has happened. In Neverland, Captain Hook and his pirate crew soon attack the children. Jealous of Peter&#x27;s affection for Wendy, Tinker Bell tricks the Lost Boys into shooting the girl out of the sky, who mistakes her for a bird. Fortunately, Wendy survives, saved by an acorn Peter had given her earlier. Peter banishes Tinker Bell and ends their friendship.

Wendy agrees to the Lost Boys&#x27; request to be their &quot;mother&quot;, while Peter takes the role of their father. Meanwhile, John and Michael encounter Tiger Lily, a Native American princess, and Hook and his crew take the three to the Black Castle. Peter, Wendy, and the Lost Boys rescue them, as Hook is chased by the crocodile who has followed him for years. After a celebration at the Native American camp, Peter shows Wendy the fairies&#x27; home and the two share a romantic dance. Hook spies on the pair and convinces Tinker Bell that Peter will eventually choose to leave Neverland for Wendy. When Wendy asks Peter to express his feelings, he angrily demands she return home, refusing to believe that he can ever feel love without having to grow up. Peter then flies off, returns to the Darling nursery and unsuccessfully tries shutting the open window, determined to keep Wendy, John and Michael in Neverland.

Wendy urges her brothers to return home with her, as they are starting to forget their parents. The Lost Boys eventually decide to join them, dismaying Peter. Wendy says goodbye to Peter, leaving him a cup of medicine to drink. When Wendy leaves the hideout, she and the rest of the boys are captured by Hook&#x27;s crew, who also poison Peter&#x27;s medicine. However, Tinker Bell drinks it and succumbs. A distraught Peter repeatedly proclaims his belief in fairies and telepathically reaches out to everyone at Neverland and London to do the same. This revives Tinker Bell, who helps Peter rescue Wendy and free the Lost Boys. During the ensuing fight with the pirates, Hook forcefully uses Tinker Bell&#x27;s dust to grant him flying abilities. During their duel, Hook taunts Peter about Wendy wanting to abandon him, and how she will eventually grow up and marry another man. Weakened, Peter falls and is incapacitated. Hook allows Wendy to say goodbye to Peter before killing him. Finally professing her love for Peter, Wendy kisses him, bringing back his happiness.

Peter defeats Hook, who is swallowed up by the crocodile. Covering the &quot;Jolly Roger&quot; in fairy dust, Peter flies Wendy and the boys back to London where they are reunited with their parents, who adopt the rest of the Lost Boys. Slightly, who got lost on the way to London and arrives at the house late, is adopted by Aunt Millicent while Mr. Darling reconciles with his children. Peter promises Wendy he will never forget her and one day he will return to visit her, before returning to Neverland with Tinker Bell. Despite never seeing Peter again, she continues telling his story to her children, and in turn to their grandchildren and descendants.

==Production==
===Development===
The film is dedicated to Dodi Al-Fayed, who was executive producer of the 1991 film &quot;Hook&quot;. Al-Fayed planned to produce a live action version of Peter Pan, and shared his ideas with Diana, Princess of Wales (who was President of Great Ormond St Hospital), who said she &quot;could not wait to see the production once it was underway.&quot; Al-Fayed&#x27;s father, Mohammed Al-Fayed, co-produced the 2003 adaptation of the tale after his son died in the car crash which also killed Diana. &quot;Finding Neverland&quot;, a film about J. M. Barrie and the creation of Peter Pan, was originally scheduled to be released in 2003, but the producers of this film – who held the screen rights to the story – refused permission for that film to use scenes from the play unless its release was delayed until the following year.

Walt Disney Pictures originally intended to co-finance the film with Columbia Pictures and Revolution Studios, with Buena Vista Pictures Distribution handling distribution in North America, the United Kingdom and Australia, but negotiations broke down following Disney&#x27;s refusal to change certain aspects of the project. On June 24, 2002, it was announced that Universal Pictures had taken over Disney&#x27;s role as the third co-financier and would release the movie in most English-speaking territories and France.

===Casting===
Contrary to the traditional stage casting, the film featured a young boy in the title role. In July 2002, at age 13, Jeremy Sumpter was selected for the role of Peter Pan. Since the first stage production of the story, the title role has usually been played by a woman, a tradition followed in the first film adaptation. Two subsequent animated adaptations have featured a male voice actor as Peter Pan, and a Soviet live-action film adaptation for television cast a boy to play the role. This film was the first live-action theatrical release with a boy playing the part. The casting of a single actor to play both George Darling and Captain Hook follows a tradition also begun in the first staging of the play. Jason Isaacs was selected for the part.

Brie Larson and Emma Roberts auditioned for Wendy Darling.

===Filming===
Sumpter did nearly all of his stunts for the film himself. To prepare, he says he practiced sword fighting as much as five hours a day, as well as training in gymnastics and lifting weights. Isaacs trained for sword fighting as well. Principal photography began on 17 September 2002 and concluded on 5 May 2003, taking place entirely inside sound stages on Australia&#x27;s Gold Coast, Queensland. According to Fisher, the decision to shoot in Australia was based on the low value of the Australian dollar at that time.
Hogan had originally planned on filming in a variety of locations such as Tahiti, New Zealand, and London but abandoned this idea after scouting some of the locations.
Filming on sound stages did help &quot;retain some of the theatricality of the original play&quot;, something which Hogan thought was important.

===Visual effects===
The visual effects in the film are a mixture of practical and digital. The fairies that appear in the film are actors composited into the film with some digital enhancements. According to actor Jason Isaacs, the filmmakers were impressed with actress Ludivine Sagnier&#x27;s performance and decided to abandon their plans to make Tinker Bell entirely computer-animated. The film also features a large, computer-generated crocodile. Another character, an animatronic parrot, appears in some scenes on the pirate ship. A similar parrot later appeared in &quot;Peter Pan &amp; Wendy&quot;, but in more scenes than this one. A complex harness was built to send the live-action actors rotating and gliding through the air for the flight sequences. They were then composited into the shots of London and Neverland, although they are sometimes replaced with computer-generated figures. One other aspect of bringing the story to life was the complex sword-fighting sequences, for which the actors were trained. Sumpter said that &quot;I had to train for five months before the shoot. I had to do harness training to learn how to fly and learn how to sword fight,&quot; and that, &quot;I got stabbed a couple of times with a sword.&quot; Isaacs also mentioned he had to learn to sword fight with his left hand, since he himself is right handed; the original source material states the hook replaces the pirate&#x27;s right hand. They decided to maintain the accuracy instead of changing the hand the hook is on, as it has been done in other adaptations. Hogan says that the flying scenes were very difficult to accomplish, but that, &quot;it was tougher on the kids than it was for me. They were up there on the harness 12&#x27; off the ground, having to make it look like flying is easy and fun.&quot; Sumpter grew several inches over the course of the film&#x27;s production, requiring staging tricks to retain Hook&#x27;s height advantage over Peter in face-to-face scenes late in the process. Hollywood-based producer Lucy Fisher also said that, &quot;The window he flies out of had to be enlarged twice.&quot;

==Release==

This film was released in theatres on 18 December 2003 in Australia, on 24 December 2003 in the United Kingdom and on 25 December 2003 in the United States. For the promotion of the film, the original novel of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; by J.M. Barrie was re-released displaying the film&#x27;s promotional material.

Universal Pictures released the film in North America and through United International Pictures in the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, France and all other English-speaking territories. Columbia TriStar Film Distributors International released the film in all other territories aside from Scandivanian territories, Portugal and Israel, where Revolution Studios handled international sales. Revolution Studios also held worldwide television rights.

A video game based on the film titled &quot;Peter Pan: The Motion Picture Event&quot; was released for Game Boy Advance on 4 November 2003, developed by Saffire and published by Atari Interactive, receiving mixed reviews from critics.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Peter Pan&quot; received generally positive reviews. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 77% based on 145 reviews and an average rating of 6.8/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Solid if far from definitive, this version of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; is visually impressive, psychologically complex and faithful to its original source.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A-&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half out of four stars. MovieGuide has also favourably reviewed the film, calling it &quot;a wonderfully crafted, morally uplifting movie that intentionally emphasizes the fantasy elements of the story both in dialogue and design of the film.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;Peter Pan&quot; earned $48,462,608 at the box office in the United States and another $73.5 million outside the United States, which brought the worldwide total to nearly $122 million. The film&#x27;s failure was partly due to its competition with the highly anticipated epic fantasy &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; released the week before, and the family comedy &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;, which opened on the same day.

<doc id="740746" wikidata="Q23807835" url="?curid=740746" title="Adult neurogenesis">
<text>Adult neurogenesis is the process in which neurons are generated from neural stem cells in the adult. This process differs from prenatal neurogenesis.

In most mammals, new neurons are born throughout adulthood in two regions of the brain:
* The subgranular zone (SGZ), part of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, where neural stem cells give birth to granule cells (implicated in memory formation and learning).
* The subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles, which can be divided into three microdomains: lateral, dorsal and medial. Neural stem cells migrate to the olfactory bulb through the rostral migratory stream where they differentiate into interneurons participating in the sense of smell. In humans, however, few if any olfactory bulb neurons are generated after birth.

More attention has been given to the neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus than in the striatum. In rodents, many of the newborn dentate gyrus neurons die shortly after they are born, but a number of them become functionally integrated into the surrounding brain tissue. Adult neurogenesis in rodents is reported to play a role in learning and memory, emotion, stress, depression, response to injury, and other conditions.

The numbers of neurons born in the human adult hippocampus remains controversial; some studies have reported that in adult humans about 700 new neurons are added in the hippocampus every day, while more recent studies show that adult hippocampal neurogenesis does not exist in humans, or, if it does, it is at undetectable levels. Recent evidence shows that adult neurogenesis is essentially extinct in humans. The experiments advocating for the presence of adult neurogenesis have focused on how dual antigen retrieval finds that DCX antibodies are staining many cells within the adult human dentate gyrus. This finding is not as clear though as supporters of adult neurogenesis suggest; the dentate gyrus cells stained with DCX have been shown to have a mature morphology, contrasting the idea that novel neurons are being generated within the adult brain. The role of new neurons in human adult brain function thus remains unclear.

==Mechanism==

===Adult neural stem cells===

Neural stem cells (NSCs) are the self-renewing, multipotent cells that generate the main phenotypes of the nervous system.

=== Lineage reprogramming (trans-differentiation) ===
Emerging evidence suggests that neural microvascular pericytes, under instruction from resident glial cells, are reprogrammed into interneurons and enrich local neuronal microcircuits. This response is amplified by concomitant angiogenesis.

==Model organisms of neurogenesis==
===Planarian===
Planarian are one of the earliest model organisms used to study regeneration with Pallas as the forefather of planarian studies. Planarian are a classical invertebrate model that in recent decades have been used to examine neurogenesis. The central nervous system of a planarian is simple, though fully formed with two lobes located in the head and two ventral nerve cords. This model reproduces asexually producing a complete and fully functioning nervous system after division allowing for consistent examination of neurogenesis.

===Axolotl===
The axolotl is less commonly used than other vertebrates, but is still a classical model for examining regeneration and neurogenesis. Though the axolotl has made its place in biomedical research in terms of limb regeneration, the model organism has displayed a robust ability to generate new neurons following damage. Axolotls have contributed as a bridge organism between invertebrates and mammals, as the species has the regenerative capacity to undergo complete neurogenesis forming a wide range of neuronal populations not limited to a small niche, yet the complexity and architecture is complex and analogous in many ways to human neural development.

=== Zebrafish ===
Zebrafish have long been a classical developmental model due to their transparency during organogenesis and have been utilized heavily in early development neurogenesis. The zebrafish displays a strong neurogenerative capacity capable of regenerating a variety of tissues and complete neuronal diversity (with the exception of astrocytes, as they have yet to be identified within the zebrafish brain) with continued neurogenesis through the life span. In recent decades the model has solidified its role in adult regeneration and neurogenesis following damage. The zebrafish, like the axolotl, has played a key role as a bridge organism between invertebrates and mammals. The zebrafish is a rapidly developing organism that is relatively inexpensive to maintain, while providing the field ease of genetic manipulation and a complex nervous system.

=== Chick ===
Though avians have been used primarily to study early embryonic development, in recent decades the developing chick has played a critical role in the examination of neurogenesis and regeneration as the young chick is capable of neuronal-turnover at a young age, but loses the neurogenerative capacity into adulthood. The loss of neuroregenerative ability over maturation has allowed investigators to further examine genetic regulators of neurogenesis.

=== Rodents ===

Rodents, mice and rats, have been the most prominent model organism since the discovery of modern neurons by Santiago Ramon y Cajal. Rodents have a very similar architecture and a complex nervous system with very little regenerative capacity similar to that found in humans. For that reason, rodents have been heavily used in pre-clinical testing. Rodents display a wide range of neural circuits responsible for complex behaviors making them ideal for studies of dendritic pruning and axonal shearing. While the organism makes for a strong human analog, the model has its limitations not found in the previous models: higher cost of maintenance, lower breeding numbers, and the limited neurogenerative abilities.

To some extent, adult neurogenesis in rodents may be induced by selective disruption of Notch signalling in astrocytes: this produces novel neurons which functionally integrate into the striatal circuit.

Adult neurogenesis in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus of rodents generates oxidative stress and production of reactive oxygen species that can damage both DNA and lipids. The oxidative stress caused by postnatal neurogenesis may significantly contribute to the reduced learning and memory that occurs with increasing age.

=== Octopus ===

A cephalopod also known as the common octopus, this organism has an intricate nervous system that demonstrates the brain&#x27;s capacity to produce new cells. In this case and in other taxa when compared, these organisms adapt to unpredictable environments by using newly formed brain cells. This is over a short life-span (female about one year) where wild common octopuses focus most of their energy on mating and offspring care. Findings suggest that the octopus vulgaris like other short-lived species have a complex hippocampal proliferation, needed for spatial/navigation, and short and long-term memory.

=== Chickadees ===

Black-capped chickadees are a well-known model species in the field of neuroscience for their neural mechanisms in song vocalization, plasticity, and memory. Black-capped chickadees are different from other species in the larger group of songbirds because they are characterized by food-caching behaviors. Due to this behavior, chickadees can be described through their remarkable spatial memory. Seasonal changes in hippocampal densities have been described since 1994 where neuronal survival peaks during the fall (October), measured by thymidine (see tracking neurogenesis below) labeled cells, weeks after injection. When compared to non-food caching birds such as the house sparrow, chickadees had significantly more hippocampal neuron recruitment from fall to spring. The changes in hippocampal density is directly associated with increased hoarding behavior, especially during the winter when better spatial memory maximizes their survival.

Over the 2 decades since the initial discovery, the specific role of chickadee hippocampus in memory has gained wide attention. In an experimental setting, hippocampal lesions affect memory for locations, validating previous notions for this specific role. Further, experimentally inhibiting neuronal proliferation decreases scores on spatial memory tasks, supporting that new neurons hold the same role as pre-existing ones. The specific function of the hippocampus, coupled with seasonal changes in their volume, point towards their temporary advantages for spatial memory consolidation. Taken all together, adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus of black-capped chickadees suggest a selective mechanisms for neuronal survival in direct correlation with seasonal food caching behavior.

Developmentally, progenitor cells called radial glial cells are thought to mitigate newly born neurons to their destinations. Radial glial cells extend processes from their soma in the avian ventricular zone to the parenchyma of the adult forebrain. These New neurons have been observed as early as 3 days after thymidine administration in the HVC and as early as 7 days before reaching the hippocampus. Avian migration of new neurons are analogous to mammalian species, providing a future direction in exploring neurogenesis in mammalian species and beyond. However, captivity has been shown to reduce hippocampal volumes when compared to wild counterparts. Reduced neurogenesis in captive birds may be caused by stress, lack of exercise, diminished social interaction, and limited caching opportunities.

==Tracking neurogenesis==
The creation of new functional neurons can be measured in several ways, summarized in the following sections.

=== DNA labelling ===
Labelled DNA can trace dividing cell&#x27;s lineage, and determine the location of its daughter cells. A nucleic acid analog is inserted into the genome of a neuron-generating cell (such as a glial cell or neural stem cell). Thymine analogs (3H) thymidine and BrdU are commonly used DNA labels, and are used for radiolabelling and immunohistochemistry respectively.

=== Fate determination via neuronal lineage markers ===
DNA labeling can be used in conjunction with neuronal lineage markers to determine the fate of new functional brain cells. First, incorporated labeled nucleotides are used to detect the populations of newly divided daughter cells. Specific cell types are then determined with unique differences in their expression of proteins, which can be used as antigens in an immunoassay. For example, NeuN/Fox3 and GFAP are antigens commonly used to detect neurons, glia, and ependymal cells. Ki67 is the most commonly used antigen to detect cell proliferation. 
Some antigens can be used to measure specific stem cell stages. For example, stem cells requires the sox2 gene to maintain pluripotency and is used to detect enduring concentrations of stem cells in CNS tissue. The protein nestin is an intermediate filament, which is essential for the radial growth of axons, and is therefore used to detect the formation of new synapses.

===Cre-Lox recombination===

Some genetic tracing studies utilize cre-lox recombination to bind a promoter to a reporter gene, such as lacZ or GFP gene. This method can be used for long term quantification of cell division and labeling, whereas the previously mentioned procedures are only useful for short-term quantification.

===Viral vectors===

It has recently become more common to use recombinant viruses to insert the genetic information encoding specific markers (usually protein fluorophores such as GFP) that are only expressed in cells of a certain kind. The marker gene is inserted downstream of a promoter, leading to transcription of that marker only in cells containing the transcription factor(s) that bind to that promoter. For example, a recombinant plasmid may contain the promoter for doublecortin, a protein expressed predominantly by neurons, upstream of a sequence coding for GFP, thereby making infected cells fluoresce green upon exposure to light in the blue to ultraviolet range while leaving non doublecortin expressing cells unaffected, even if they contain the plasmid. Many cells will contain multiple copies of the plasmid and the fluorphore itself, allowing the fluorescent properties to be transferred along an infected cell&#x27;s lineage.

By labeling a cell that gives rise to neurons, such as a neural stem cells or neural precursor cells, one can track the creation, proliferation, and even migration of newly created neurons. It is important to note, however, that while the plasmid is stable for long periods of time, its protein products may have highly variable half lives and their fluorescence may decrease as well as become too diluted to be seen depending on the number of round of replication they have undergone, making this method more useful for tracking self-similar neural precursor or neural stem cells rather than neurons themselves. The insertion of genetic material via a viral vector tends to be sporadic and infrequent relative to the total number of cells in a given region of tissue, making quantification of cell division inaccurate. However, the above method can provide highly accurate data with respect to when a cell was born as well as full cellular morphologies.

== Methods for inhibiting neurogenesis ==
Many studies analyzing the role of adult neurogenesis utilize a method of inhibiting cell proliferation in specific brain regions, mimicking an inhibition of neurogenesis, to observe the effects on behavior.

=== Pharmacological inhibition ===
Pharmacological inhibition is widely used in various studies, as it provides many benefits. It is generally inexpensive as compared to other methods, such as irradiation, can be used on various species, and does not require any invasive procedures or surgeries for the subjects.

However, it does pose certain challenges, as these inhibitors can&#x27;t be used to inhibit proliferation in specific regions, thus leading to nonspecific effects from other systems being affected. To avoid these effects, more work must be done to determine optimal doses in order to minimize the effects on systems unrelated to neurogenesis.

A common pharmacological inhibitor for adult neurogenesis is methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM), a chemotherapeutic agent. Other cell division inhibitors commonly used in studies are cytarabine and temozolomide.

=== Pharmacogenetics ===
Another method used to study the effects of adult neurogenesis is using pharmacogenetic models. These models provide different benefits from the pharmacological route, as it allows for more specificity by targeting specific precursors to neurogenesis and specific stem cell promoters. It also allows for temporal specificity with the interaction of certain drugs. This is beneficial in looking specifically at neurogenesis in adulthood, after normal development of other regions in the brain.

The herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) has been used in studies in conjunction with antiviral drugs to inhibit adult neurogenesis. It works by targeting stem cells using glial fibrillary acidic proteins and nestin expression. These targeted stem cells undergo cell death instead of cell proliferation when exposed to antiviral drugs.

Cre protein is also commonly used in targeting stem cells that will undergo gene changes upon treatment with tamoxifen.

=== Irradiation ===
Irradiation, the process of exposing parts of something or someone to radiation, is a method that allows for very specific inhibition of adult neurogenesis. It can be targeted to the brain to avoid affecting other systems and having nonspecific effects. It can even be used to target specific brain regions, which is important in determining how adult neurogenesis in different areas of the brain affects behavior.

Irradiation has previously been tested in adult rats, with no significant changes in cognition having been reported. However, neurogenesis in this study was stopped from progressing when the irradiation was specifically directed towards the hippocampus.

However, irradiation is more expensive than the other methods and also requires large equipment with trained individuals.

== Inhibition of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus ==
Many studies have observed how inhibiting adult neurogenesis in other mammals, such as rats and mice, affects their behavior. Inhibition of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus has been shown to have various effects on learning and memory, conditioning, and investigative behaviors.

Impaired fear conditioning has been seen in studies involving rats with a lack of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Inhibition of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus has also been linked to changes in behavior in tasks involving investigation. Rats also show decreased contextualized freezing behaviors in response to contextualized fear and impairment in learning spatial locations when lacking adult neurogenesis.

=== Effects on pattern separation ===
The changes in learning and memory seen in the studies mentioned previously are thought to be related to the role of adult neurogenesis in regulating pattern separation. Pattern separation is defined as &quot;a process to remove redundancy from similar inputs so that events can be separated from each other and interference can be reduced, and in addition can produce a more orthogonal, sparse, and categorized set of outputs.&quot;

This impairment in pattern separation could explain the impairments seen in other learning and memory tasks. A decreased ability in reducing interference could lead to greater difficulty in forming and retaining new memories, although it&#x27;s hard to discriminate between effects of neurogenesis in learning and pattern separation due to limitations in the interpretation of behavioral results.

Studies show that rats with inhibited adult neurogenesis demonstrate difficulty in differentiating and learning contextualized fear conditioning. Rats with blocked adult neurogenesis also show impaired differential freezing when they are required to differentiate between similar contexts. This also affects their spatial recognition in radial arm maze tests when the arms are closer together rather than when they are further apart. A meta-analysis of behavioral studies evaluating the effect of neurogenesis in different pattern separation tests has shown a consistent effect of neurogenesis ablation on performance, although there are exceptions in the literature.

=== Effects on behavioral inhibition ===
Behavioral inhibition is important in rats and other animals in halting whatever they are currently doing in order to reassess a situation in response to a threat or anything else that may require their attention.

Rats with lesioned hippocampi show less behavioral inhibition when exposed to threats, such as cat odor. The disruption of normal cell proliferation and development of the dentate gyrus in developing rats also impairs their freezing response, which is an example of behavior inhibition, when exposed to an unfamiliar adult male rat.

This impairment in behavioral inhibition also ties into the process of learning and memory, as repressing wrong answers or behaviors requires the ability to inhibit that response.

==Implications==

===Role in learning===

The functional relevance of adult neurogenesis is uncertain, but there is some evidence that hippocampal adult neurogenesis is important for learning and memory. Multiple mechanisms for the relationship between increased neurogenesis and improved cognition have been suggested, including computational theories to demonstrate that new neurons increase memory capacity, reduce interference between memories, or add information about time to memories. Given that the rate of the neurogenesis does not change substantially during the adulthood, it has been proposed that unique episodic memories can be created by simply relying on the increased capacity of the young neurons of a particular age to establish stable new synapses with peers representing the unique features of an event to be memorized Experiments aimed at ablating neurogenesis have proven inconclusive, but several studies have proposed neurogenic-dependence in some types of learning, and others seeing no effect. Studies have demonstrated that the act of learning itself is associated with increased neuronal survival. However, the overall findings that adult neurogenesis is important for any kind of learning are equivocal.

===Alzheimer&#x27;s disease===

Some studies suggest that decreased hippocampal neurogenesis can lead to development of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD). Yet, others hypothesize that AD patients have increased neurogenesis in the CA1 region of Ammon&#x27;s horn (the principal region of AD hippocampal pathology) in order to compensate for neuronal loss. While the exact nature of the relationship between neurogenesis and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease is unknown, insulin-like growth factor 1-stimulated neurogenesis produces major changes in hippocampal plasticity and seems to be involved in Alzheimer&#x27;s pathology. Allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid, aids the continued neurogenesis in the brain. Levels of allopregnanolone in the brain decline in old age and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Allopregnanolone has been shown through reversing impairment of neurogenesis to reverse the cognitive deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Eph receptors and ephrin signaling have been shown to regulate adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus and have been studied as potential targets to treat some symptoms of AD. Molecules associated with the pathology of AD, including ApoE, PS1 and APP, have also been found to impact adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus.

===Schizophrenia===
Studies suggest that people with schizophrenia have a reduced hippocampus volume, which is believed to be caused by a reduction of adult neurogenesis. Correspondingly, this phenomenon might be the underlying cause of many of the symptoms of the disease. Furthermore, several research papers referred to four genes, dystrobrevin binding protein 1 (DTNBP1), neuregulin 1 (NRG1), disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), and neuregulin 1 receptor (ERBB4), as being possibly responsible for this deficit in the normal regeneration of neurons. Similarities between depression and schizophrenia suggest a possible biological link between the two diseases. However, further research must be done in order to clearly demonstrate this relationship.

===Stress and depression===

Many now believe stress to be the most significant factor for the onset of depression. As discussed above, hippocampal cells are sensitive to stress which can lead to decreased neurogenesis. This area is being considered more frequently when examining the causes and treatments of depression. Studies have shown that removing the adrenal gland in rats caused increased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. The adrenal gland is responsible for producing cortisol in response to a stressor, a substance that when produced in chronic amounts causes the down regulation of serotonin receptors and suppresses the birth of neurons. It was shown in the same study that administration of corticosterone to normal animals suppressed neurogenesis, the opposite effect. The most typical class of antidepressants administered for this disease are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and their efficacy may be explained by neurogenesis. In a normal brain, an increase in serotonin causes suppression of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) through connection to the hippocampus. It directly acts on the paraventricular nucleus to decrease CRH release and down regulate norepinephrine functioning in the locus coeruleus. Because CRH is being repressed, the decrease in neurogenesis that is associated with elevated levels of it is also being reversed. This allows for the production of more brain cells, in particular at the 5-HT1a receptor in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus which has been shown to improve symptoms of depression. It normally takes neurons approximately three to six weeks to mature, which is approximately the same amount of time it takes for SSRIs to take effect. This correlation strengthens the hypothesis that SSRIs act through neurogenesis to decrease the symptoms of depression. Some neuroscientists have expressed skepticism that neurogenesis is functionally significant, given that a tiny number of nascent neurons are actually integrated into existing neural circuitry. However, a recent study used the irradiation of nascent hippocampal neurons in non-human primates (NHP) to demonstrate that neurogenesis is required for antidepressant efficacy.

Adult-born neurons appear to have a role in the regulation of stress. Studies have linked neurogenesis to the beneficial actions of specific antidepressants, suggesting a connection between decreased hippocampal neurogenesis and depression. In a pioneer study, scientists demonstrated that the behavioral benefits of antidepressant administration in mice is reversed when neurogenesis is prevented with x-irradiation techniques. In fact, newborn neurons are more excitable than older neurons due to a differential expression of GABA receptors. A plausible model, therefore, is that these neurons augment the role of the hippocampus in the negative feedback mechanism of the HPA-axis (physiological stress) and perhaps in inhibiting the amygdala (the region of brain responsible for fearful responses to stimuli). Indeed, suppression of adult neurogenesis can lead to an increased HPA-axis stress response in mildly stressful situations. This is consistent with numerous findings linking stress-relieving activities (learning, exposure to a new yet benign environment, and exercise) to increased levels of neurogenesis, as well as the observation that animals exposed to physiological stress (cortisol) or psychological stress (e.g. isolation) show markedly decreased levels of newborn neurons. Under chronic stress conditions, the elevation of newborn neurons by antidepressants improves the hippocampal-dependent control on the stress response; without newborn neurons, antidepressants are unable to restore the regulation of the stress response and recovery becomes impossible.

Some studies have hypothesized that learning and memory are linked to depression, and that neurogenesis may promote neuroplasticity. One study proposes that mood may be regulated, at a base level, by plasticity, and thus &quot;not chemistry&quot;. Accordingly, the effects of antidepressant treatment would only be secondary to change in plasticity. However another study has demonstrated an interaction between antidepressants and plasticity; the antidepressant fluoxetine has been shown to restore plasticity in the adult rat brain. The results of this study imply that instead of being secondary to changes in plasticity, antidepressant therapy could promote it.

==== Major depressive disorder ====
Research indicates that adult hippocampal neurogenesis is inversely related to major depressive disorder (MDD). Neurogenesis is decreased in the hippocampus of animal models of major depressive disorder, and many treatments for the disorder, including antidepressant medication and electroconvulsive therapy, increase hippocampal neurogenesis. It has been theorized that decreased hippocampal neurogenesis in individuals with major depressive disorder may be related to the high levels of stress hormones called glucocorticoids, which are also associated with the disorder. The hippocampus instructs the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to produce fewer glucocorticoids when glucocorticoid levels are high. A malfunctioning hippocampus, therefore, might explain the chronically high glucocorticoid levels in individuals with major depressive disorder. However, some studies have indicated that hippocampal neurogenesis is not lower in individuals with major depressive disorder and that blood glucocorticoid levels do not change when hippocampal neurogenesis changes, so the associations are still uncertain.

===Parkinson&#x27;s disease===
Parkinson&#x27;s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Transplantation of fetal dopaminergic precursor cells has paved the way for the possibility of a cell replacement therapy that could ameliorate clinical symptoms in affected
patients. In recent years, scientists have provided evidence for the existence of neural stem cells with the potential to produce new neurons, particularly of a dopaminergic phenotype, in the adult mammalian brain. Experimental depletion of dopamine in rodents decreases precursor cell proliferation in both the subependymal zone and the subgranular zone. Proliferation is restored completely by a selective agonist of D2-like (D2L) receptors. Neural stem cells have been identified in the neurogenic brain regions, where neurogenesis is constitutively ongoing, but also in the non-neurogenic zones, such as the midbrain and the striatum, where neurogenesis is not thought to occur under normal physiological conditions. Newer research has shown that there in fact is neurogenesis in the striatum.
A detailed understanding of the factors governing adult neural stem cells &quot;in vivo&quot; may ultimately lead to elegant cell therapies for neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease by mobilizing autologous endogenous neural stem cells to replace degenerated neurons.

=== Traumatic brain injury ===
Traumatic brain injuries vary in their mechanism of injury, producing a blunt or penetrating trauma resulting in a primary and secondary injury with excitotoxicity and relatively wide spread neuronal death. Due to the overwhelming number of traumatic brain injuries as a result of the War on Terror, tremendous amounts of research have been placed towards a better understanding of the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injuries as well as neuroprotective interventions and possible interventions prompting restorative neurogenesis. Hormonal interventions, such as progesterone, estrogen, and allopregnanolone have been examined heavily in recent decades as possible neuroprotective agents following traumatic brain injuries to reduce the inflammation response stunt neuronal death. In rodents, lacking the regenerative capacity for adult neurogenesis, the activation of stem cells following administration of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, PNU-282987, has been identified in damaged retinas with follow-up work examining activation of neurogenesis in mammals after traumatic brain injury. Currently, there is no medical intervention that has passed phase-III clinical trials for use in the human population.

===Effects of sleep reduction===
One study has linked lack of sleep to a reduction in rodent hippocampal neurogenesis. The proposed mechanism for the observed decrease was increased levels of glucocorticoids. It was shown that two weeks of sleep deprivation acted as a neurogenesis-inhibitor, which was reversed after return of normal sleep and even shifted to a temporary increase in normal cell proliferation. More precisely, when levels of corticosterone are elevated, sleep deprivation inhibits this process. Nonetheless, normal levels of neurogenesis after chronic sleep deprivation return after 2 weeks, with a temporary increase of neurogenesis. While this is recognized, overlooked is the blood glucose demand exhibited during temporary diabetic hypoglycemic states. The American Diabetes Association amongst many documents the pseudosenilia and agitation found during temporary hypoglycemic states. Much more clinical documentation is needed to competently demonstrate the link between decreased hematologic glucose and neuronal activity and mood.

On the other hand, short-term sleep deprivation is known to have an antidepressant effect in humans. In animal models, it increases adult neurogenesis and reduces depression-like behavior.

==Factors affecting==

===Changes in old age===
Neurogenesis is substantially reduced in the hippocampus of aged animals, raising the possibility that it may be linked to age-related declines in hippocampal function. For example, the rate of neurogenesis in aged animals is predictive of memory. However, new born cells in aged animals are functionally integrated. Given that neurogenesis occurs throughout life, it might be expected that the hippocampus would steadily increase in size during adulthood, and that therefore the number of granule cells would be increased in aged animals. However, this is not the case, indicating that proliferation is balanced by cell death. Thus, it is not the addition of new neurons into the hippocampus that seems to be linked to hippocampal functions, but rather the rate of turnover of granule cells.

===Effects of exercise===

Scientists have shown that physical activity in the form of voluntary exercise results in an increase in the number of newborn neurons in the hippocampus of mice and rats. These and other studies have shown that learning in both species can be enhanced by physical exercise. Recent research has shown that brain-derived neurotrophic factor and insulin-like growth factor 1 are key mediators of exercise-induced neurogenesis. Exercise increases the production of BDNF, as well as the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor. Exercise increases the uptake of IGF-1 from the bloodstream into various brain regions, including the hippocampus. In addition, IGF-1 alters c-fos expression in the hippocampus. When IGF-1 is blocked, exercise no longer induces neurogenesis. Other research demonstrated that exercising mice that did not produce beta-endorphin, a mood-elevating hormone, had no change in neurogenesis. Yet, mice that did produce this hormone, along with exercise, exhibited an increase in newborn cells and their rate of survival.
While the association between exercise-mediated neurogenesis and enhancement of learning remains unclear, this study could have strong implications in the fields of aging and/or Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

===Effects of cannabinoids===

Some studies have shown that the stimulation of the cannabinoids results in the growth of new nerve cells in the hippocampus from both embryonic and adult stem cells. In 2005 a clinical study of rats at the University of Saskatchewan showed regeneration of nerve cells in the hippocampus. Studies have shown that a synthetic drug resembling THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, provides some protection against brain inflammation, which might result in better memory at an older age. This is due to receptors in the system that can also influence the production of new neurons.
Nonetheless, a study directed at Rutgers University demonstrated how synchronization of action potentials in the hippocampus of rats was altered after THC administration. Lack of synchronization corresponded with impaired performance in a standard test of memory.
Recent studies indicate that a natural cannabinoid of cannabis, cannabidiol (CBD), increases adult neurogenesis while having no effect on learning. THC however impaired learning and had no effect on neurogenesis. 
A greater CBD to THC ratio in hair analyses of cannabis users correlates with protection against gray matter reduction in the right hippocampus. CBD has also been observed to attenuate the deficits in prose recall and visuo-spatial associative memory of those currently under the influence of cannabis, implying neuroprotective effects against heavy THC exposure. Neurogenesis might play a role in its neuroprotective effects, but further research is required.

A few studies have reported a positive association between THC and hippocampal neurogenesis. Some of them hypotethize a biphasic effect, some of them express that part of the negative effects could be attributable to neuroadaptation due to exposure at a specific period of life, and that it could be reversed.

==Regulation==

Many factors may affect the rate of hippocampal neurogenesis. Exercise and an enriched environment have been shown to promote the survival of neurons and the successful integration of newborn cells into the existing hippocampus. Another factor is central nervous system injury since neurogenesis occurs after cerebral ischemia, epileptic seizures, and bacterial meningitis. On the other hand, conditions such as chronic stress, viral infection and aging can result in a decreased neuronal proliferation.
Circulating factors within the blood may reduce neurogenesis. In healthy aging humans, the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of certain chemokines are elevated. In a mouse model, plasma levels of these chemokines correlate with reduced neurogenesis, suggesting that neurogenesis may be modulated by certain global age-dependent systemic changes. These chemokines include CCL11, CCL2 and CCL12, which are highly localized on mouse and human chromosomes, implicating a genetic locus in aging. Another study implicated the cytokine, IL-1beta, which is produced by glia. That study found that blocking IL-1 could partially prevent the severe impairment of neurogenesis caused by a viral infection.

Epigenetic regulation also plays a large role in neurogenesis. DNA methylation is critical in the fate-determination of adult neural stem cells in the subventricular zone for post-natal neurogenesis through the regulation of neuronic genes such as &quot;Dlx2&quot;, &quot;Neurog2&quot;, and &quot;Sp8&quot;. Many microRNAs such as miR-124 and miR-9 have been shown to influence cortical size and layering during development.

ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A3 have been shown to negatively regulate adult neurogenesis.

==History==
Early neuroanatomists, including Santiago Ramón y Cajal, considered the nervous system fixed and incapable of regeneration. The first evidence of adult mammalian neurogenesis in the cerebral cortex was presented by Joseph Altman in 1962, followed by a demonstration of adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in 1963. In 1969, Joseph Altman discovered and named the rostral migratory stream as the source of adult generated granule cell neurons in the olfactory bulb. Up until the 1980s, the scientific community ignored these findings despite use of the most direct method of demonstrating cell proliferation in the early studies, i.e. 3H-thymidine autoradiography. By that time, Shirley Bayer (and Michael Kaplan) again showed that adult neurogenesis exists in mammals (rats), and Nottebohm showed the same phenomenon in birds sparking renewed interest in the topic. Studies in the 1990s finally put research on adult neurogenesis into a mainstream pursuit. Also in the early 1990s hippocampal neurogenesis was demonstrated in non-human primates and humans. More recently, neurogenesis in the cerebellum of adult rabbits has also been characterized. Further, some authors (particularly Elizabeth Gould) have suggested that adult neurogenesis may also occur in regions within the brain not generally associated with neurogenesis including the neocortex. However, others have questioned the scientific evidence of these findings, arguing that the new cells may be of glial origin. Recent research has elucidated the regulatory effect of GABA on neural stem cells. GABA&#x27;s well-known inhibitory effects across the brain also affect the local circuitry that triggers a stem cell to become dormant. They found that diazepam (Valium) has a similar effect.

<doc id="740749" wikidata="Q823886" url="?curid=740749" title="Miura, Kanagawa">
<text>is a city located in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan.

As of April 1, 2017, the city had an estimated population of 44,132, with 17,473 households, and a population density of . The total area is .

==History==
The area of modern Miura has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Archaeologists have uncovered numerous remains from the Japanese paleolithic, Jōmon and Yayoi periods. From the late Heian period through the end of the Sengoku period, the area was ruled by the Miura clan, until they were annihilated by the rival Hojo clan. The local inlet of Aburatsubo is said to be named for this event.

During the Edo period, it was &quot;tenryō&quot; territory ruled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate.

After the Meiji Restoration, the town of Misaki within Miura District, Kanagawa was created on April 1, 1889. The town was electrified in 1913, but did not have running water until 1934.

The area was badly shaken during the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, which had its epicenter in Sagami Bay just a few kilometers offshore from the city. The whole geographical area around the city was lifted by about 10 meters by tectonic movement, before subsiding to its original level during the next few days. No major tsunami was recorded.

On January 1, 1955, Misaki absorbed neighboring Minami-Shitaura Town and Hasse Village to create the city of Miura. The city was connected to the Tokyo Metropolis by rail on July 7, 1966 with the opening of Miurakaigan Station on the outskirts of the city. The line was extended to Misakiguchi Station on April 26, 1975, but plans to further extend the line to the city center have been abandoned.

Miura came to some infamy in 2001 after the dismembered body of Lucie Blackman was found in a seaside cave a few hundred meters from the apartment of serial rapist, Joji Obara.

Miura has been the arrival point of several trans-Pacific sailboat races, such as the 1969 San Francisco-Tokyo Transpacific Yacht Race. Misaki was also the arrival point of the record solo circumnavigation of 71-year-old Minoru Saito, on June 6, 2005.

==Geography==
Miura is located on the very southern end of Miura Peninsula in southeast Kanagawa Prefecture, surrounded on three sides by the Pacific Ocean, with Sagami Bay to the west. To the south of the urban area and port is the island of Jōgashima, connected to the city by a bridge. It is a popular destination for weekend tourism. The Jōgashima Lighthouse was built by the French engineer Léonce Verny at the end of the 19th century.

===Surrounding municipalities===
*Kanagawa Prefecture
**Yokosuka

===Climate===
==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Miura peaked in the 1990s and has declined since.
==Economy==
The economy of the city is dominated by commercial fishing, centered on the harbor of Misaki, Japan&#x27;s 18th most important fishing harbor, and the 2nd for its catch of tuna, which the local mascot of Miura Tunanosuke is named and designed after. Misaki is an important fishing harbor, mainly specializing in the processing of tuna. The harbor also has a quay which can accommodate sailboats from neighboring marinas.

Agriculture remains important to the local economy, especially watermelon and &quot;daikon&quot;.

==Transportation==

===Railway===
*Keikyū Kurihama Line

===Highway===
* Japan National Route 134

==Education==
Miura is home to Misaki Fisheries High School, a specialist fishery high school. The school trains students in one of four commercial fisheries skills: radio communications, engineering, food processing, and ocean fishing. The school maintains two fishing vessels, one of which is the ocean-going tuna fishing ship &quot;Shōnan Maru&quot;, launched in 2005. The &quot;Shōnan Maru&quot; is a frequent visitor to the port of Honolulu as part of the training programme.

==Local events==
Miura is well known for the Miura Marathon which is normally held in the first week of March. The race consists of three events: 5 kilometer, 10 kilometer, and a half marathon.

<doc id="740756" wikidata="Q830385" url="?curid=740756" title="California quail">
<text>The California quail (Callipepla californica), also known as the California valley quail or Valley quail, is a small ground-dwelling bird in the New World quail family. These birds have a curving crest, &quot;plume&quot; or topknot made of six feathers, that droops forward: black in males and brown in females; the flanks are brown with white streaks. Males have a dark brown cap and a black face with a brown back, a grey-blue chest and a light brown belly. Females and immature birds are mainly grey-brown with a light-colored belly.
Their closest relative is Gambel&#x27;s quail, which has a more southerly distribution and a longer crest at , a brighter head and lacks the scaly appearance of the California quail. The two species separated about 1–2 million years ago, during the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene. It was selected as the state bird of California in 1931.

==Taxonomy==

===Subspecies===
There are seven recognized subspecies:

* &quot;C. c. californica&quot; (Shaw, 1798) – northern Oregon and western Nevada to southern California and Coronado Islands
* &quot;C. c. achrustera&quot; (Peters, 1923) – San Lucas California quail – southern Baja California 
* &quot;C. c. brunnescens&quot; (Ridgway, 1884) – extreme northern coastal California to southern Santa Cruz County
* &quot;C. c. canfieldae&quot; (Van Rossem, 1939) – Owen Valley quail – Owens Valley of east central California
* &quot;C. c. catalinensis&quot; (Grinnell, 1906) – Santa Catalina quail – Santa Catalina Island (off southern California)
* &quot;C. c. orecta&quot; (Oberholser, 1932) – Warner Valley quail – Warner Valley in Oregon to extreme northern California
* &quot;C. c. plumbea&quot; (Grinnell, 1926) – San Quintin California quail – San Diego County to southern Baja California

==Behavior==
The California quail is a highly sociable bird that often gathers in small flocks known as &quot;coveys&quot;. One of their daily communal activities is a dust bath. A group of quail will select an area where the ground has been newly turned or is soft, and using their underbellies, will burrow downward into the soil some one to two inches. They then wriggle about in the indentations they have created, flapping their wings and ruffling their feathers, causing dust to rise in the air. They seem to prefer sunny places in which to create these dust baths. An ornithologist is able to detect the presence of quail in an area by spotting the circular indentations left behind in the soft dirt, some in diameter.

They are year-round residents. Although this bird coexists well at the edges of urban areas, it is declining in some areas as human populations increase. They were originally found mainly in the southwestern United States but they have been introduced into other areas including British Columbia, Hawaii, Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina, Peru, South Africa, New Zealand, and to Norfolk Island and King Island in Australia.
These birds forage on the ground, often scratching at the soil. They can sometimes be seen feeding at the sides of roads. Their diet consists mainly of seeds and leaves, but they also eat some berries and insects; for example, Toyon berries are a common food source. If startled, these birds explode into short rapid flight, called &quot;flushing&quot;. Given a choice, they will normally escape on foot.

==Breeding==


Their breeding habitat is shrubby areas and open woodlands in western North America. The nest is a shallow scrape lined with vegetation on the ground beneath a shrub or other cover. The female usually lays approximately 12 eggs. Once hatched, the young associate with both adults. Often, families group together, into multifamily &quot;communal broods&quot; which include at least two females, multiple males and many offspring. Males associated with families are not always the genetic fathers. In good years, females will lay more than one clutch, leaving the hatched young with the associated male and laying a new clutch, often with a different associated male.

They have a variety of vocalizations including the social &quot;chicago&quot; call, contact &quot;pips&quot; and warning &quot;pips&quot;. During the breeding season, males utter the agonistic &quot;squill&quot; and will often interrupt their social mate&#x27;s &quot;chicago&quot; call with a &quot;squill,&quot; a possible form of antiphonal calling.

==State bird==
The California quail is the state bird of California. It was established as the state bird in 1931.

The quail population has fluctuated significantly throughout California. Once plentiful in San Francisco, by 2017 only one California quail remained in the city. Local birders named the male bird Ishi after the last known member of California&#x27;s Native American Yahi tribe. Quail were likely introduced to Santa Catalina Island about 12,000 years ago by Native Americans, and there is a minimal genetic difference between the island and the mainland quail populations.

<text>Wimbledon Football Club was an English football club formed in Wimbledon, southwest London, in 1889 and based at Plough Lane from 1912 to 1991. Founded as Wimbledon Old Centrals, the club were a non-League team for most of their history. Nicknamed &quot;the Dons&quot; and latterly also &quot;the Wombles&quot;, they won eight Isthmian League titles, the FA Amateur Cup in 1963 and three successive Southern League championships between 1975 and 1977, and were then elected to the Football League. The team rose quickly from obscurity during the 1980s and were promoted to the then top-flight First Division in 1986, just four seasons after being in the Fourth Division.

Wimbledon&#x27;s &quot;Crazy Gang&quot;—so-called because of the boisterous, eccentric behaviour of the players—won the FA Cup in 1988, beating that season&#x27;s League champions Liverpool, and thereby became one of only three clubs to have won both the FA Cup and its amateur counterpart. In 1991, following the publication of the Taylor Report recommending all-seater grounds for top-flight clubs, Wimbledon left Plough Lane to groundshare with nearby Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park—an originally temporary arrangement that ended up lasting over a decade. The team remained in the First Division and its successor the FA Premier League until they were relegated in 2000.
In 2001, after rejecting a variety of possible local sites and others further afield, the club announced its intention to move north to Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire. The idea of Wimbledon leaving south London was deeply unpopular, both with the bulk of the club&#x27;s established fanbase and with football supporters generally, but an independent commission appointed by the Football Association granted permission in May 2002. A group of supporters, appalled by the decision, responded by forming a new club, AFC Wimbledon, to which the majority of Wimbledon FC fans switched allegiance. The move went ahead and Wimbledon FC played home games in Milton Keynes in the 2003-2004 season; Milton Keynes Dons F.C. would compete in the Football League from 2004 onwards.

==History==
===Non-League beginnings===

Wimbledon Old Central Football Club formed in 1889, taking its name from the Old Central School on Wimbledon Common where players had been pupils. The club&#x27;s first match was a 10 victory over Westminster, and it took only seven years for success to come to Wimbledon as they won both the Clapham League and the Herald League in 189596. Wimbledon won the Clapham League again in 190001, as well as two minor trophies. At a meeting convened on 1 May 1905, the decision was taken to drop &quot;Old Central&quot; from the club&#x27;s name, and under its new name Wimbledon Football Club won the South London Charity Cup the same year; however, excessive debts caused the club to fold in 1910. A year later, the club was restarted under the name Wimbledon Borough, though &#x27;Borough&#x27; was dropped from the team&#x27;s name after barely a year. They continued to play on Wimbledon Common and at various other locations in the Wimbledon area until 1912, when the side settled at Plough Lane. Wimbledon joined the Athenian League for 191920, and finished as runners-up in their second season in the new division. The club then joined the Isthmian League and began to prosper, winning four Isthmian League titles during the 1930s and reaching the FA Amateur Cup final in 193435. The club reached another FA Amateur Cup final in 194647 and twice finished as runners-up in the league over the next few seasons.
Wimbledon won the Isthmian League for the fifth time in 195859 before starting a period of domination that saw three successive championships: 196162, 196263 and 196364. Wimbledon also lifted the FA Amateur Cup in 196263, beating Sutton United 42; the club&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer, Eddie Reynolds, scored all four Wimbledon goals with his head, and in doing so became the only player to have headed in all four of his side&#x27;s goals in a Wembley match – as of 2012, still a unique feat. Following these successes, the decision was taken for the club to turn professional for the 196465 season and to enter the Southern League. Wimbledon&#x27;s success continued in their new league, and the team finished as runners-up at the first attempt. Wimbledon became nationally famous during an FA Cup run during the 197475 season; entering the competition at the first qualifying round, Wimbledon defeated Bracknell Town, then Maidenhead United, Wokingham Town, Guildford &amp; Dorking United, Bath City and Kettering Town to find themselves in the third round proper. They then became the first non-League team of the 20th century to beat a First Division side away from home by defeating Burnley at Turf Moor. Their good form continued in the fourth round, as the team held the reigning First Division champions Leeds United to a 00 draw at Elland Road. Goalkeeper Dickie Guy saved a penalty from Peter Lorimer to earn a replay, which was narrowly lost 10 by an own goal in front of over 40,000 spectators at Selhurst Park. After winning the Southern League three times running, from 197475 to 197677, Wimbledon were elected to the Football League in place of Workington for the 197778 season.

===The Football League===

The 1977–78 season was a satisfactory Football League debut for Wimbledon, who finished 13th in the Fourth Division. Allen Batsford had resigned as manager on 2 January 1978 to be succeeded by Dario Gradi, who guided the club to promotion in 197879. Wimbledon&#x27;s first stay in the Third Division was not a successful one. The team struggled, and were relegated in bottom place, winning just 10 league games all season. Following relegation, relocation to Milton Keynes was considered – chairman Ron Noades entered talks with the Milton Keynes Development Corporation about the possibility of moving the club to the new town, but the plan was never executed.

Still in south London, 1980–81 saw Wimbledon regain Third Division status at the first attempt, at the end of an eventful season which saw chairman Ron Noades walk out of the club to take over Crystal Palace, taking manager Dario Gradi to Selhurst Park with him. At Plough Lane, assistant manager Dave Bassett was promoted to manager. Under Bassett, Wimbledon were relegated in 22nd place. Just before the survival battle was lost, injured defender Dave Clement committed suicide. Wimbledon once again regained Third Division status at the first time of asking, triumphing as Fourth Division champions in 198283, and in the next season the Wimbledon players continued to excel as they achieved a second promotion to the Second Division after finishing runners-up with 97 league goals.

1984–85 was Wimbledon&#x27;s first season in the Second Division, and everyone at the club was prepared for long and hard struggle to preserve this status. A 12th-place finish was more than satisfactory for a club that was playing at this level for the first time. The next year started well for Wimbledon as Middlesbrough were defeated 30 on the opening day of the season – the team was soon looking like a contender for promotion. Promotion in third place was sealed on the final day of the season with an away victory at Huddersfield Town. Thus, Wimbledon had reached the First Division, only four years after playing in the Fourth Division and nine years after being elected into The Football League.

===The top flight===

Many observers tipped Wimbledon to go straight back down in 198687, but after losing the first game of the season away at Manchester City, Wimbledon won the next four games to perch atop the league table on 1 September. Wimbledon eventually finished sixth, before Dave Bassett moved on to Watford. His successor was Bristol Rovers manager Bobby Gould. Dubbed &quot;The Crazy Gang&quot; because of the eccentric behaviour of its players, fans and chairman, Sam Hammam, the club&#x27;s greatest moment came in 1988 when, very much against expectation, the team won the FA Cup, beating overwhelming favourites Liverpool 10 with a goal from Lawrie Sanchez. 37,000 Wimbledon fans witnessed captain Dave Beasant becoming the first goalkeeper to save a penalty in an FA Cup final, stopping John Aldridge&#x27;s shot. The only downside of this triumph was that the club would not be able to compete in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, as the ban on English teams from European competition following the Heysel Stadium Disaster was still in operation at this time.
Just days after the FA Cup triumph, Wimbledon directors announced plans to build a new all-seater stadium in the club&#x27;s home borough of Merton. In the season following the FA Cup triumph, Gould steered Wimbledon to a secure 12th-place finish in the First Division, and in 198990 the side finished eighth. Despite these successes, Bobby Gould was replaced in 1990 by Ray Harford, who in the same year as Wimbledon&#x27;s FA Cup triumph had guided Luton Town to victory in the League Cup. Under Harford&#x27;s management, Warren Barton was purchased for £300,000 while Wimbledon had another strong season in 199091, finishing seventh.

Nothing came of the plans for a new ground and at the end of 199091 the club&#x27;s board decided that Plough Lane was beyond redevelopment to meet with new legislation from the Taylor Report, requiring all-seater stadiums. Consequently, the club moved to Selhurst Park before the 199192 season, ground-sharing with Crystal Palace. Harford suddenly resigned in October 1991, to be replaced by Peter Withe. Withe lasted until just after the turn of the new year, when Joe Kinnear was promoted from the role of youth team coach, initially taking over as interim manager. After guiding Wimbledon to 13th place in the First Division and booking a place in the inaugural FA Premier League, Kinnear got the manager&#x27;s job on a permanent basis.

1992–93 began as a struggle for Wimbledon – the club were third from bottom on Boxing Day. However, the team recovered well in the new year and finished 12th. The next season was one of Wimbledon&#x27;s best seasons to date as the side finished sixth in the FA Premier League and reached the quarter-finals of the League Cup. Wimbledon remained hard to beat in 199495, finishing ninth in the league. During the close season the Dons made their first and only appearance in a UEFA European competition, being required by the FA to enter the Intertoto Cup. However, after fielding an under-strength side containing reserves, youth team players and unsigned trialists in their group stage games, the club – along with Tottenham Hotspur – were banned from European competition for the following season. Not that it mattered; after losing Barton to Newcastle, 199596 saw a drop to 14th. Wimbledon made a fine start to the 199697 campaign – after losing the first three fixtures, the players proceeded to win their next seven and reach second place in the FA Premier League. There was delight in early February when they eliminated Manchester United from the FA Cup – Wimbledon reached both the FA Cup semi-finals and the semi-finals of the League Cup. Wimbledon&#x27;s last hope of qualifying for European competition now lay with a challenge for a top-five league finish, but the team could only manage eighth.

===Relegation and relocation===
The 1997–98 season looked highly promising for Wimbledon as late on as Christmas, as the team were regularly in the top five. However, the side&#x27;s form in the second half of the season was less impressive, and the club dipped to 15th place in the final table – the lowest finish yet for Wimbledon in the top flight. A similar pattern followed in 199899 – a good start followed by a slump. As late on as mid-March, the team were on the fringe of a UEFA Cup place. The club record signing of West Ham United striker John Hartson boosted hopes of success for Wimbledon, but a terrible run of form in the final weeks of the season saw the side dip to 16th in the final table. Wimbledon again reached the League Cup semi-finals that season – losing to eventual winners Tottenham Hotspur.

Joe Kinnear stepped down as manager in June 1999 due to ill health, and was succeeded by Norwegian coach Egil Olsen. Wimbledon reached the quarter-finals of the League Cup, but the team&#x27;s league form slowly deteriorated during the second half of the season. Olsen left in early May with the club threatened by relegation. Long-serving coach Terry Burton took over, but on 14 May 2000, 12 years to the day after the FA Cup win, the side was relegated from the top flight after 14 years after a 20 defeat at Southampton and 10 win for Bradford City over Liverpool. Burton remained manager of Wimbledon for two seasons in the second tier before he was sacked at the end of 200102 after the club had narrowly missed out on the promotion play-offs two seasons in a row.

===Relocation, renaming, and foundation of AFC Wimbledon===
In August 2001, the club announced its intent to relocate to Milton Keynes. Despite opposition from Wimbledon fans, The Football League, and The Football Association, they were given permission to do so on 28 May 2002 after a 21 vote by the three-person, independent commission appointed by the F.A. The approval of the decision to move the club caused supporters who were against the move to found a new club, AFC Wimbledon, to which most Wimbledon fans switched their allegiance;
gates at the new club were over 3,500, compared with 2,500 or less for the relocated club.

Goalkeeping coach Stuart Murdoch was promoted to manager, and as attendances plummeted, Murdoch&#x27;s team finished 10th in the league during the club&#x27;s last full season at Selhurst Park. Wimbledon entered administration in June 2003, and played their first match in Milton Keynes in September. The administrator in charge of the club&#x27;s financial affairs sold any player who could command a transfer fee and Murdoch&#x27;s team finished at the bottom of the league.

The club were brought out of administration at the end of the 200304 season, and &quot;Milton Keynes Dons&quot; was formed in the club&#x27;s place.

==Club identity==
The club&#x27;s nickname was the Dons, though the club were also often referred to in the media as the Wombles from the mid-1970s onwards. Following the FA Cup victory in 1988, the term Crazy Gang also started to be applied; originally to the players, though over time to the club as a whole. The club introduced a character mascot in 2000, a Womble named Wandle the Womble. However, following the relocation of the club in 2003, the owners of the Wombles brand refused to renew the licensing agreement in protest at the move. Three years later, a deal was agreed that saw a similar character named Haydon the Womble appear at AFC Wimbledon.

The colours most associated with the club were blue and yellow. The club&#x27;s first colours were navy blue and white, though the kit changed several times soon after the club&#x27;s foundation, between combinations of: brown and blue striped shirts with navy blue shorts; green and white striped shirts with navy blue shorts; green shirts and black shorts; white shirts with navy blue shorts, and finally green and black striped shirts with black shorts. Royal blue shirts with navy blue shorts and socks were finally settled upon in 1918, initially bearing a &quot;W&quot; (for Wimbledon) in the centre of the chest. Wimbledon players then regularly wore royal blue shirts with black shorts and socks until a shift in the 1950s saw the shorts change from black to white. A combination of blue shirts, blue shorts and white socks was introduced in 1966, before being abandoned a year later in favour of an all-blue outfit. The white socks returned in 1970. A blue and yellow combination was first used in 1975, but was replaced after a year with an all-white outfit trimmed with blue, and this was the kit in which the club played its first season in the Football League. In 1978, Yellow shirts, blue shorts and yellow socks were adopted, before the club made the change to an all-blue strip with yellow markings in 1981. The kit underwent only minor changes until 1993, when a darker, deep navy blue replaced the royal blue shade that had been used for the previous twelve years. Wimbledon wore these colours for the remainder of their history. As for change colours, a red kit, with black trim, was a frequent choice in the 1990s. The club had a green away kit for the 200001 season.
The first crest the club wore was the emblem of the Municipal Borough of Wimbledon. This emblem appeared on Wimbledon shirts from the late 1920s until the mid-1950s, when no badge was worn. The coat of arms returned in the early 1970s, before the club adopted its own badge on election to The Football League in 1977. The crest was very similar to the badge most commonly associated with the club – the difference being the inclusion of white rather than yellow. Yellow replaced white in 1981, and this logo was used until 2003. After the club&#x27;s relocation to Milton Keynes was confirmed in May 2002, the College of Arms informed the club in August 2002 that its continued use of the Borough arms was illegal. A replacement, given the go-ahead on 12 April 2003, featured a stylised eagle&#x27;s head – an element from the Wimbledon arms – drawn in navy blue and yellow outline, the yellow forming a stylised rendering of the letters &quot;MK&quot; (for Milton Keynes). Despite being officially adopted in April 2003, the logo&#x27;s use was inconsistent: the club officially announced that it would be used &quot;on all club kit, merchandise and literature from the start of [the 200304] season&quot;, including on a new white away kit and on an amended version of the previous season&#x27;s home outfit, but this never occurred; both the home and away colours from 2002 to 2003 were retained for the following year with the municipal arms still present. Moreover, the old crest continued to appear on official club statements and literature towards the end of the 200304 season, making the status of the new badge ambiguous at best.

== Mascot ==
From 2000 to June 2003, the original Wimbledon F.C. had used a Womble mascot named &quot;Wandle&quot;, named after the local River Wandle, as a club mascot. However, in light of the controversy over the moving of the club to Milton Keynes, the legal licence to use the character was withdrawn by the Wombles&#x27; creator, Elisabeth Beresford, in protest at the nature of the club&#x27;s relocation.

==Stadium==

Wimbledon originally played on Wimbledon Common, using the Fox and Grapes public house in Camp Road as the team&#x27;s headquarters and changing room. The club moved to Plough Lane in September 1912. During the 1930s and 1940s, crowds of between 7,000 and 10,000 were not uncommon at the ground. Wimbledon&#x27;s highest attendance at the ground came on 2 March 1935, when 18,080 people were attracted to an FA Amateur Cup tie against HMS Victory. Floodlights were first used on 3 October 1960 in a London Charity Cup match against Arsenal.

The Plough Lane ground remained comparatively basic, and by the time the club had risen to the First Division the stadium had not changed greatly from Wimbledon&#x27;s recent non-league days. At the time of the club&#x27;s acceptance into the Football League in 1977, applicants had only to meet minimal stadium criteria, and once in the League these same criteria sufficed regardless of whether the club subsequently found itself in the Fourth or First Division. However, following the Hillsborough disaster and the subsequent Taylor Report, the football authorities introduced far stricter safety rules, which gave top-flight clubs specific deadlines by which to redevelop terraced grounds or to build new all-seater stadiums. The board of the club decided that Plough Lane could not be made to comply with these new requirements economically and, in 1990, they announced plans to temporarily groundshare with Crystal Palace at their Selhurst Park stadium.

Given the location of the Plough Lane ground, at the junction of two major roads and beside the River Wandle, major redevelopment of the site as a modern all-seater stadium might have been difficult, though not impossible. The club&#x27;s board of directors maintained that it had &quot;searched exhaustively with Merton Council&quot; for a site in or around Merton on which to build a new stadium, looking at &quot;14 different sites over a period of five years&quot;, in addition to commissioning feasibility studies for redeveloping both Plough Lane and the neighbouring site at Wimbledon Stadium. Despite this, nothing ever became of the board&#x27;s continual promises to redevelop the site or to build a new ground within the borough, and the club remained as tenants at Selhurst Park for twelve years.

Wimbledon&#x27;s first match at the National Hockey Stadium in Milton Keynes was played on 27 September 2003. The club remained there for the rest of its final season, and the ground became the first home of Milton Keynes Dons.

==Supporters==
Due to Plough Lane&#x27;s modest capacity and Wimbledon&#x27;s unprecedented rise from non-League football to the First Division in under ten years, the club had a much lower level of support than its top-flight rivals. During Wimbledon&#x27;s first season in the Football League, Wimbledon&#x27;s average attendance was only 3,135 – however, by the club&#x27;s appearance in the top flight nine years later the average attendance had risen by 149% to 7,811. Attendances did not immediately change much following the move to Selhurst Park in 1991 – however, the larger capacity gradually started to be used. Average crowds peaked at 18,235 in 199899, and during the next season, the team&#x27;s final year in the FA Premier League, home crowds averaged 17,157. With relegation, attendances dropped to an average of only 7,897 during 200001 as organized supporter boycotts of matches in protest at the proposed relocation took effect. Wimbledon averaged 6,961 during the final season before the club&#x27;s relocation to Milton Keynes was confirmed.

Following the sanctioning of the move, most of the team&#x27;s support left in specific protest at the club&#x27;s relocation, to follow AFC Wimbledon, the new club founded by Wimbledon supporters. During the 200203 season, AFC Wimbledon&#x27;s first and Wimbledon&#x27;s last full season in south London, average crowds at the new club were actually higher than those at the original club. Attendances during the 200304 season, Wimbledon&#x27;s last, were higher than those at AFC Wimbledon: Wimbledon averaged 4,751 at the National Hockey Stadium, compared to AFC Wimbledon&#x27;s 2,606.

The club had two main supporters organisations– the long established official Wimbledon F.C. Supporters Club, which was tied to the club, and the more radical Wimbledon Independent Supporters Association (WISA) which was founded in 1995. The WISA was instrumental in the organisation of the supporter boycotts at Selhurst Park, and in the formation of The Dons Trust in March 2002. This trust, created in part to oppose the relocation to Milton Keynes, helped the WISA to found AFC Wimbledon months after its own establishment. Both the WISA and The Dons Trust from this point became affiliated to AFC Wimbledon, while the official Wimbledon F.C Supporters Club became defunct following the relocation.

==Rivalries==
During much of Wimbledon&#x27;s amateur and later semi-professional history, a strong local rivalry existed with neighbouring Tooting &amp; Mitcham United F.C.

From the mid 1980s, the club&#x27;s main rivals were considered by fans to be fellow south London club Crystal Palace (who were their landlord from 1991 to 2003) and west London-based Chelsea; however, neither of these rivalries was seriously reciprocated. Wimbledon were in the same division as Palace for a total of 11 seasons between 1984 and 2004, and in the same division as Chelsea for all but one season between 1986 and 2000.

==Records and statistics==
The record for most appearances for Wimbledon was held by Roy Law, who turned out for the club 644 times between 1958 and 1972; Law&#x27;s 433 league appearances was also a record. Wimbledon&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer was Eddie Reynolds, who scored 340 goals in 329 matches between 1957 and 1966. The closest to Reynolds&#x27;s record was Ian Cooke, who notched 297 between 1964 and 1977; Cooke also made the second highest total number of appearances for the team, having appeared 615 times in a Wimbledon shirt.

The records for most appearances and goals for Wimbledon in the Football League were both held by Alan Cork. Cork scored 145 league goals for the club in 430 matches. Cork also held the record for most Football League goals in a season, with 29 during 198384. Wimbledon&#x27;s most capped player was Kenny Cunningham, who was capped 16 times for the Republic of Ireland during his time at the club. Wimbledon&#x27;s most expensive signing was John Hartson, for whom the club paid West Ham United £7.5 million on 15 January 1999. The highest fee that the club received was the £7 million Newcastle United parted with to sign Carl Cort on 6 July 2000.

Wimbledon&#x27;s best win was a 6–0 league victory over Newport County on 3 September 1983, while the worst defeat was an 80 League Cup defeat at Everton on 29 August 1978. Wimbledon&#x27;s longest unbeaten league run was 22 matches between 15 January and 14 May 1984; the longest league run without a win, 14, was set between 19 March and 28 August 2000. Wimbledon&#x27;s longest run of league wins was seven, set between 9 April and 7 May 1983 and matched from 4 September to 19 October 1996. Wimbledon&#x27;s longest run of league defeats was the eleven matches lost in a row from 10 January to 27 March 2004.

Wimbledon&#x27;s highest attendance, 30,115, was set on 9 May 1993 for the FA Premier League match against Manchester United at Selhurst Park but their official home attendance record is 18,080 vs HMS Victory in an FA Amateur Cup tie on 9 March 1935 at Plough Lane due to Selhurst Park being borrowed from Crystal Palace FC.

===European record===

1Both home matches in this competition were played at Brighton and Hove Albion Goldstone Ground, as Selhurst Park was unavailable.

==Managers==
Prior to the appointment of H. R. Watts as first team manager in 1930, a committee would deal with first team affairs, such as choosing the team on a matchday. Doc Dowden was appointed manager in 1946, and stayed in the position until leaving at the end of the 195455 season. Les Henley arrived in his place as first team coach, and stayed at the club for sixteen years in which the club progressed immensely, winning the FA Amateur Cup as well as three Isthmian League championships before turning professional and moving to the Southern League. However, in 1971 Henley was replaced by Mike Everitt, who arrived as player-manager. After two seasons, Everitt left to manage Brentford and Dick Graham arrived as a replacement. Graham remained until March 1974, and a replacement was not appointed until July of that year, when Allen Batsford was made manager. Batsford led Wimbledon to the Football League, but resigned only halfway through the first League season. Dario Gradi was made manager three days later, but after three seasons he too resigned. His replacement was Dave Bassett, who took Wimbledon to sixth in the First Division before moving to Watford. Bobby Gould spent three years as manager before being replaced by Ray Harford, who spent just over a season with Wimbledon. After Harford, Peter Withe had a spell as manager lasting only three months. Joe Kinnear was brought in during January 1992, and managed the club until leaving in 1999 due to ill health. A season was spent under Egil Olsen in which the team was relegated from the FA Premier League before Terry Burton was made manager. Burton&#x27;s Wimbledon narrowly missed the play-offs twice in a row before he was sacked. Stuart Murdoch managed Wimbledon for the club&#x27;s final two seasons.

==Honours==

Wimbledon were a successful club even before election to the Football League, winning eight Isthmian League titles (including three in a row from 1962 to 1964) and three successive Southern League titles (from 1975 to 1977). Having also won the FA Amateur Cup in 1963, the run of Southern League titles prompted Football League election in 1977.

Even at the higher level, Wimbledon continued to collect honours; the most notable being the FA Cup victory in 1988, which made Wimbledon only the third club to have won both the FA Cup and its amateur equivalent. Despite swift success in The Football League, the club&#x27;s rapid ascent combined with short spells in the Second and Third Divisions meant that the team only won a solitary divisional championship within the League – the Fourth Division title of 198283.

<text>William in Trouble is a book in the children&#x27;s Just William series by Richmal Crompton. The book contains 10 short stories. It was first published in 1927.

==The Stories==

===William and the Early Romans===
The village is excited when a group an Archaeological Society finds remains of a real Roman Villa in the valley near the village. The Outlaws go to visit the excavation site, but after a while the excitement begins to pall. So William decides to shoot one of the coins that has been excavated with his slingshot- however, he misses and hits the leader of the excavation in the small of the back, and he yells. The Outlaws then, fearing reprimand, run away. The next day is a half-holiday, and William decides to set up his &quot;own&quot; excavation, fully expecting he can find his own Roman villa nearby. They set up the other side of the Archeological Societies excavation, and pretend to find remains of a Roman Villa (when all they are actually finding are coins that William has been throwing down in the soil). He soon attracts a crowd and the real excavation loses its spectators.

However, before he can continue any further he is chased away by Farmer Jenks. He comes home, and finds the little old man he shot earlier is at his house, staying with his father! Luckily, the man is short sighted and does not recognise him. The story ends comically with the old man&#x27;s and William&#x27;s &quot;finds&quot; being mixed up, where the old man describes things such as William&#x27;s soap dish as being &quot;a most rare item of great value&quot; to a hall full of people.

===William and the Fairy Daffodil===
The story starts with Ginger describing a book he got after being to the dentists, called &quot;The Jungle Explorers&quot;, where the natives roam in the jungle doing all sorts of things the Outlaws are never allowed to do, such as never going to the dentist or brushing their hair. They decide to go find some of the natives in the local forest. In the end they give up their search, and play a game of hide and seek. William runs off and finds a main road. He jumps in a motor car parked nearby – however, people get in the car and he has to hide himself under some sheets. He is driven to a far away place that he is not familiar with. A woman calls him into her school, under the impression he is the gardener&#x27;s boy. She asks him to sit down while the class of girls draw him, as the model she had arranged for hadn&#x27;t turned up. Most of the girls are rude to him, but one small one at the back is nice to him. He goes over to her and begins talking to her, telling her about all the adventures he has been on, such as &quot;having a tooth out without gas&quot;. She doesn&#x27;t reply and begins crying – she&#x27;s homesick and wants to go home to her mother, but there is a play on today and she will be caught before she can get to the station and go home to her mother.

William helps her by acting as her part in the play – a fairy. William plays the part very badly- tripping over everything in front of a hall full of people from the village (his family is also in the crowd). As he trips up, his headgear falls off: he is instantly recognised by his mother and father and half the village. At the end, he is pursued by half the school. However, it all turns out okay as the girl he helped is the daughter of one of his father&#x27;s business friends.

===William and the Chinese God===
William, for a dare, steals a small &quot;Chinese god&quot; figure from his headteacher&#x27;s house. He has to hide the figure from his mother, so he hides it on his drawing room mantelpiece. However, his headteacher (Mr. Marks), comes over to tea and notices it, and becomes very interested in it. Mrs. Brown gives it to him, much to William&#x27;s horror. He gets it back and hides it again, in his neighbours house, Mr. Marks finds it again, but thinks that it is just one similar to his own. William gets in a muddle as he hides it, and eventually gives it (twice) to Mr. Marks. In the end, when Mr. Marks finds out that there was only one all along, he turns to ask William about it – but he&#x27;s gone.

===All the News===
It&#x27;s raining and the outlaws are at a loss for what they can do. Eventually, they decide to make a newspaper. Violet Elizabeth, the daughter of Mrs. Bott, comes in and begins to &quot;help&quot; them. They want her to go away (as they always do), however she doesn&#x27;t. Eventually she goes out, much to the relief of the outlaws, who continue working on the newspaper, but comes back with a man&#x27;s wallet, saying she did it because you need to have crime in a newspaper. The man comes back to retrieve his wallet, when Ethel (William&#x27;s sister, and also the girl the man is in love with), enters, and a few photos of Ethel fall out of the man&#x27;s wallet- the Outlaws and Violet Elizabeth are let off the hook, and the rain has stopped – so they go outside and resume their normal outdoor activities.

===William&#x27;s Mammoth Circus===
Joan, William&#x27;s only friend who is a girl, is coming back after a long time away from them. The Outlaws, who all approve of Joan, decide to make a celebration for her- so they decide to do a circus. They decide to do the circus in Rose Mount School, which is empty (as it is the holidays). The rehearsal isn&#x27;t a success, but they go on anyway. On the evening before the actual show for Joan, they bring all the animals for the circus – an annoyed cat, called Rameses, a clockwork monkey, Jumble and Douglas&#x27; Aunt&#x27;s Parrot. They tiptoe past the caretaker, but then all the animals start making noises, so they have to hurry up. They hide the animals in different rooms, so that &quot;even if she (the caretaker) does find one she won&#x27;t find them all&quot;. On the day of the show, the school is unexpectedly full up of people. Their animals are still inside, so what do they do now? They attempt to get inside the school, but fail. They find out that the school is being used for the &quot;Study of Psychical Philosophy&quot; group.

The leader of the group goes down to the cellar, hearing the parrot, believing it is an apparition. The parrot says &quot;Stop&quot;. She stops. Then the parrot says, &quot;Oh, Beware&quot;, and she runs up stairs and the parrot laughs. She asks if anybody else has heard something in the night- and they all have (they have heard the animals the Outlaws hid in the school), and they believe that the house is full of ghosts who are unfriendly to them, so they leave, allowing the Outlaws to do their &quot;circus&quot; for Joan with no trouble- and she loves it, and it&#x27;s a success.

===The Magic Monkey===
The Outlaws watch some girls playing hockey – so they make up their own kind of hockey with upside down walking sticks. They enjoy the game and play it whenever they get a chance- and other children see the Outlaws playing it, and start to do it as well. In less than a week, the entire village&#x27;s population of boys is playing it. The only people who refuse to play it are Hubert Lane and his gang (they are the Outlaws enemies). Hubert Lane and the Outlaws organise a match. The Outlaws arrive before the match, and spot Hubert and his best friend hiding all the good food that had been organised for the match, and leaving the bad, not-as-good food out for the Outlaws.

Later, after the match, the Outlaws and Hubert Laneites go to eat the food. The Outlaws pretend to have a &quot;magic monkey&quot; (which is in fact simply Henry&#x27;s sister&#x27;s toy monkey) and find all the food that Hubert Laneites had hid there. The Laneites are so surprised at this they really believe it is a magic monkey! Then William says that if you dunk Bertie Franks and Hubert Lane in the rain tub 3 times, you will get a penknife and a magnifying glass- but they mustn&#x27;t look first. So they all do it, and they find them! The Outlaws are happy because they&#x27;re now equal with Hubert Lane.

===William Among the Poets===
Robert, William&#x27;s Brother, has just recovered from influenza. He has &quot;discovered&quot; poetry and reads it aloud to himself all the time, believing it is the best thing in the world. The outlaws watch him from the bushes, laughing at him all the time. The next day Robert has stopped reading it aloud, so they go off and play their games. However, the games aren&#x27;t as fun because they are wondering if Robert is doing anything funny- so they go off to find him. They find him attempting to make a Poetry society, where he makes a rule that all of the people in the society must make a piece of poetry every week. The Outlaws keep all the members of the poetry society under close watch. The next week, when the society reassembles, each of the members read out their poem. Two of the poems aren&#x27;t very good, and Robert&#x27;s does okay, but Oswald&#x27;s knocks them all out of the water with a fantastic poem. Because of this, William&#x27;s enemies laugh at him and tease him about his brother Robert. The next time the Poetic group gets together, it becomes clear to the reader that Oswald is actually cheating by using people&#x27;s poems that have already been written – however the other members have never heard of these poems so they don&#x27;t know this.

One of the members knows of a poetry competition, and suggests that they all enter it to see if any of them win. They all enter. In the end, Oswald is shown up as the cheater that he is and Robert wins the prize.

===William at the Garden Party===
William is feeling grateful towards Robert – Robert gave him some money, in a good mood, so he could pay for his air rifle to be repaired. So William decides that he must help Robert out somehow in return. He decides to get Robert his cup back, which through a misunderstanding was now in the Vicar&#x27;s possession. He gets into the Vicar&#x27;s house and is mistaken for a boy who can play the piano very well. So he plays for them- and not very well at all. He is given refreshments before he leaves, and he takes the cup secretly away from them and puts it in Roberts room. When he goes home, the Vicar is there – and recognises him as the boy who played the piano, so he decides to stay and listen to William. (He did not hear him the first time). Suddenly, the Vicar notices a cup- a cup with his son&#x27;s name engraved on it. William did not know that the two cups had been moved around in the house, so he had brought back the wrong one.

===William Joins the Waits===
Mr. Solomon is going to take some boys carol singing, and the Outlaws are forced to go along with him. They don&#x27;t want to, but when they find out that some of the areas they are going to go singing are near people who have given them bad presents, they decide to take over the show and start to sing songs to them (for example, Uncle George had given Ginger a book called &#x27;Kings and Queens of England&#x27;, and to pay back for it he went to his house with the other 16 or so boys and sung bad songs at the top of his voice). When he goes to Aunt Jane&#x27;s to sing badly to her to make up for the bad presents, she mistakes the singing for a pack of hungry wolves (she is very old and has trouble hearing). She leans out the window with a gun, ready to shoot, much to William&#x27;s surprise. He coaxes her to put the gun away and use it as a last resort, and she agrees. William has an idea, and pretends that the color green scares away wolves- so he finds his green tie (which Aunt Jane gave him for a present), and throws it outside pretending it scares them away. (The story &quot;William Plays Santa Claus&quot; in &quot;William the Outlaw&quot; follows on from this tale, describing Mr. Solomon&#x27;s attempts to complain about William&#x27;s behaviour that night.)

===William to the Rescue===
The Outlaws have been given a tin of sardines- and they devise a new game called &quot;Canniballs&quot;. They tie the sardine to the tree and pretend it&#x27;s Ginger- and Ginger hides behind a bush doing the voice of himself. They then eat the sardine, still pretending it&#x27;s Ginger, and proceed to the next one. As he goes in for lunch, he hears Ethel rehearsing a play, saying &#x27;I don&#x27;t want to marry him! I&#x27;m being forced to marry him!&#x27;. William believes this is for real, and attempts to help her.

He finds the man who he thinks she is being forced to marry, and takes him to a hill and says &quot;Ethel&#x27;s dead&quot;. He believes it is really true and is very upset, and it gets into a very big muddle. In the end, William runs away after he discovers it was all a mistake.

<text>Quip is a collaborative productivity software suite for mobile and the Web. It allows groups of people to create and edit documents and spreadsheets as a group, typically for business purposes.

==History==
Quip was founded by Bret Taylor, a co-creator of Google Maps, CEO of FriendFeed, and the former CTO of Facebook, along with Kevin Gibbs, who founded Google App Engine. Taylor founded the company in 2012, after leaving his position at Facebook. Roughly a year later, Quip was launched to the public as a mobile-centric tool for creating shared notes, lists, and documents. The app was well-received, winning accolades as one of the best apps of the year from &quot;Time&quot;, The Next Web, and The Guardian. 

In 2015, Quip announced it had received a $30 million funding round led by Greylock Partners. 

==Features==
The core of Quip provides word processing and spreadsheet functionality, accessible via the Web, an iOS app, and an Android app. Alongside all documents on Quip is a live updating history of edits made, as well as the ability to highlight portions of a document and add comments, which facilitates collaboration. In 2015, Quip also added standalone chat rooms.

==Acquisition==
In July 2016, Salesforce announced the acquisition of Quip for an estimated total of $750 million. 

In January 2017, Quip acquired the designer studio Unity &amp; Variety.
