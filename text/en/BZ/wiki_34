<text>The , also marketed prominently as the Mazda 323, Mazda Protegé and Mazda Allegro, is a small family car that was manufactured by Mazda between 1963 and 2003. The Familia line was replaced by the Mazda3/Axela for 2004.

It was marketed as the &quot;Familia&quot; in Japan, which means &quot;family&quot; in Latin. For export, earlier models were sold with nameplates including: &quot;800&quot;, &quot;1000&quot;, &quot;1200&quot;, and &quot;1300&quot;. In North America, the 1200 was replaced by the Mazda GLC, with newer models becoming &quot;323&quot; and &quot;Protegé&quot;. In Europe, all Familias sold after 1977 were called &quot;323&quot;.

The Familia was also rebranded as the Ford Laser and Ford Meteor in Asia, Oceania, Southern Africa, some Latin American countries and, from 1991, as the Ford Escort and Mercury Tracer in North America. In addition, the Familia name was used as the [[Mazda Familia Van|Mazda Familia Wagon/Van]], a badge-engineered version of the Nissan AD wagon (1994–2017) and Toyota Probox (2018–present).

Mazda Familias were manufactured in the Hiroshima Plant and also assembled from &quot;knock-down kits&quot; in various countries including Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Colombia, and New Zealand. Some of these plants kept manufacturing the Familia long after it was discontinued at home.


== First generation (1963–1968) ==
Mazda&#x27;s automotive plans for the early sixties consisted of growing alongside the Japanese economy. To achieve this goal, they began by building an extremely affordable kei car, the R360 in 1960, planning on introducing gradually larger and pricier cars as the Japanese customers became able to afford them. As a preview, testing the waters, a larger &quot;Mazda 700&quot; prototype was shown at the eighth Tokyo Motor Show in 1961, and formed the basis for the upcoming Mazda Familia. Meanwhile, the four door version of the R360 was introduced as the Mazda Carol, which appeared in 1962, and discontinued in 1964.

The first production Familia, styled by a young Giorgetto Giugiaro while working at Carrozzeria Bertone, appeared in October 1963. In line with Mazda&#x27;s policy of only gradually approaching the production of private cars (a luxury in Japan at the time), the first Familia was initially only available as a commercial two-door wagon called the Familia van. The van was joined in April 1964 by a plusher Familia wagon, in October by a four-door sedan, and in November by a two-door sedan. The &quot;flat deck&quot; design of the sedan versions was reportedly inspired by the Chevrolet Corvair. Private car versions received foglights in the grille as well as more chrome trim. The Familia was sold in other markets as the 800.

The Familia was introduced to the Japanese market in time for the 1964 Summer Olympics which began in October.

The cars used a 782 cc, &quot;SA&quot; four-stroke aluminum straight-four engine, also known as the &quot;white engine&quot;. There was also a pickup version available from November 1964, while a box truck (called a &quot;panel van&quot; by Mazda) was added in early or mid 1965.

A new Familia 1000 coupé arrived in November 1965, with a 985 cc SOHC &quot;PC&quot; engine, and was joined by the larger Mazda Luce in 1966. Around the same time, the 800 engine was upgraded, adding three horsepower. As a number of new 1-liter vehicles were introduced by Mazda&#x27;s competitors, another 987 cc OHV engine (PB) appeared in January 1967, powering new 1000 sedan and van versions. The 1-liter sedans and vans are recognizable by their broader, rounded-off rectangular headlights. Production of the sedan continued until November 1967, while the van versions continued until they were replaced in February 1968.
Around 400,000 of the first Familias were built, 130,473 of which were sedans and coupés. Around 10,000 of the first generation Familias were exported, mainly to Australia and Oceania.

== Second generation (FA2/FA3 series 1; 1967–1977) ==
===1967–1970 (FA2)===
The new Familia appeared in November 1967 with the same pushrod 987 cc engine as used in the previous generation sedans. It was sold as the &quot;Mazda 1000&quot; in some markets. In July 1968 the rotary-engined version (R100) was introduced, along with a new coupé bodywork which was also available with the 1200 cc piston engine. After an April 1970 facelift (called the &quot;Familia Presto&quot; in the domestic Japanese market), the slightly different OHC &quot;PC&quot; 1-liter engine was also offered. A larger 1169 cc straight-four engined version came along in February 1968, becoming the &quot;Mazda 1200&quot; for export. In this form, the car was first exhibited in Europe at the 1968 Paris Motor Show in the autumn of that year. Power outputs (SAE gross) in Japan of the facelifted, overhead-cam-engined versions were respectively. The Van (wagon) model was available with either three or five doors, although most export markets only received the five-door version.


=== 1970–1973 (Familia Presto FA3 series 1)===
From April 1970, the Presto nameplate was added into the entire Familia range, &quot;Presto&quot; means &quot;quick&quot; in Italian. Brand new overhead camshaft 1.3-liter TC engine also appeared, derived from the smaller 1.0-liter OHC engine already seen in the first generation Familia coupé. At the same time, the range received a light facelift including a chrome strip around the front grille. Unlike the truck, the vans also used the &quot;Familia Presto&quot; name. Chassis codes are SPCV for the 1.0-litre and STBV for the 1.3-litre, with power outputs as for the sedan/coupé. Standard and Deluxe versions were available, with the Deluxe also offering five-door bodywork.

The Familia was exported as the &quot;Mazda 1300&quot;, and replaced the previous generation 1200 model in most markets. In Finland, the Familia Presto was marketed as the &quot;Mazda Marella.&quot; The sedan and coupé were updated in 1972 in Japan and in the autumn of 1973 for export market, but the truck and wagon/van versions continued with little change. The vans and pickup trucks actually soldiered on until 1978, by which time a wagon version of the succeeding FA4 Familia (323/GLC) had been introduced. The later pickup versions were also available in a long-wheelbase version, and still featured an (SAE gross) version of the 1.3-litre TC engine, unaffected by the tighter Japanese emissions standards for passenger cars.

The &quot;1200&quot; was offered in the United States in 1971 and again for the 1973 model year. US-market models had round sealed-beam headlamps mounted in pill-shaped bezels fitting the original openings. The 1971 version was the first piston-powered Familia sold in the United States and arrived in two- and four-door forms alongside its rotary Mazda R100 coupé counterpart. It was replaced by the somewhat larger 808 (Grand Familia) the next year. The 1200 model returned for 1973 as the base-model economy Mazda. The company then focused on performance for the next two years, dropping the economy car. After the gas crisis they returned to the economy sector with the Mizer in 1976, a rebadged 808/818.

Engine (US):
* 1971, 1973 – 1.2 L (1169 cc) I4, / 

The pickup models were built until 1991 for markets such as South Africa, Zimbabwe, and the Philippines.
In South Africa, the little &quot;bakkie&quot; was sold as the &quot;Mazda F-1000&quot; or &quot;F-1300&quot;. In Thailand, a version of the pickup was produced in small numbers until the late 1990s as the Familia Super Cab and Maxi Cab.

Engines (export power outputs, DIN):
* 1968–1973 – 1.0 L (985 cc) &quot;PB&quot; I4, / 
* 1968–1970 – 1.2 L (1169 cc) &quot;TB&quot; I4, / 
* 1970–1973 – 1.3 L (1272 cc) &quot;TC&quot; I4, 2-barrel, / 

The pickup received the BPB55, BTA55/65, or FA2T55/65/66 model codes respectively when fitted with the OHV 1.0 or 1.2, or the OHC 1.3. FA2T55 was a short bed with max load, 65 was a long bed with the same capacity, while the 66 upped that to . All three models were available as either Standard or Deluxe. The 1000 Van (Japanese terminology for the station wagon, which was intended for commercial use there) received either BPCV or BPBV chassis codes, signifying three- or five-door versions. The Familia Presto Van, with OHC engines, received chassis numbers MP3xV/SP3xV for the 1000 (3-door/5-door) and MT2xV/ST2xV for the 1200. The five-door Van range was gradually expanded downwards as the three-door models dropped in popularity. The Familia Presto Van continued largely unchanged until the summer of 1978, aside from the 1.3 losing two horsepower along the way.

=== Familia Rotary/R100 ===
In July 1968 Mazda added a Familia Rotary model to the range, offered in both two-door coupé and four-door sedan variants. Sedan models were given an additional &quot;SS&quot; nameplate. The Familia Rotary was powered by a 982 cc &quot;10A&quot; Wankel rotary engine and the coupé version was sold outside Japan as the &quot;Mazda R100&quot;. After an April 1970 update (known colloquially in Australia as the Series 2) it was known as the &quot;Familia Presto Rotary&quot; in Japan as the Presto nameplate was added into the entire Familia range. Power was rated at just due to a small carburetor (thus the &quot;R100&quot; name). The rotary engined R100 has a unique front end design, with a more prominent pointed hood, grille, and bumper. The rear also gained its own design with twin round tail lights, which became for a time a signature design element for the rotary engined versions of Mazda&#x27;s cars. Inside, the cars were more sumptuously appointed with plusher seats and chrome plated accents, full sized interior door trim panels, a floor mounted handbrake lever, and a unique cockpit styled dashboard with full instrumentation. Mazda referred to this dashboard as the &quot;T-Dash&quot;, and fitted it to top spec piston engined variants of the Familia on the Japanese market as well as the rotary models.

In Japan, the installation of a rotary engine gave Japanese buyers a financial advantage when it came time to pay the annual road tax in that they bought a car that was more powerful than a traditional inline engine, but without having the penalty for having an engine in the higher 1.0-litre tax bracket. This was the only generation of the Familia that had the rotary engine offered. When Mazda updated the rotary engine to single distributor design in late 1973 with a raft of improvements to improve reliability and fuel economy, the smaller 10A engine was discontinued. Upgrading the Familia Rotary to the 12A engine would have cost the car its tax advantage in Japan, and the decision to discontinue it was made, despite the Familia body continuing production for some years to follow.

The R100 was one of the first Mazda cars imported into the United States for the new Mazda Motors of America, sold in model years 1971 and 1972. Due to US regulations it was released in North America with round headlights fitted in place of the rectangular lights fitted in all other markets. It was a surprising hit with the American public, though sales were limited to some Northwestern states initially.

Following on the success of the Cosmo Sports at Nürburgring in 1968, Mazda decided to race another rotary car. The Familia Rotary coupé won its first outing, at the Grand Prix of Singapore, in April 1969. Next, the company took on the touring car endurance challenge at Spa, the Spa 24 Hours. For 1969, Mazda entered a pair of Familia Rotary coupés. The cars came fifth and sixth the first year after a quartet of Porsche 911s. The Familia also placed fifth at the Marathon de la Route at Nürburgring in 1969, the same race that the Cosmo had bowed at the previous year. Finally, Mazda took the Familia home for the Suzuka All-Japan Grand Cup, where it won easily. For 1970, the Familia placed eighth at the RAC Tourist Trophy in June, followed by a fourth place at the West German Touring Car race in July. At Spa, four Familias were present, battling with BMW Alpinas, and Alfa Romeos for the podium. This time, three of the Mazdas retired, with the fourth claiming the fifth position. Mazda also turned its attention to Le Mans in 1970 with rotary-powered prototypes. The company finally won that race 21 years later with the 787B.

=== Kia Brisa ===
From October 1974 until 1981, Kia Motors manufactured a pick up variant of the second generation Familia as the &quot;Kia Brisa&quot; at their first integrated automobile manufacturing facility, the Sohari Plant in Gwangmyeong, South Korea. Production originally commenced in 1973 in the form of the Brisa B-1000 pickup truck, but passenger car production (originally as the &quot;Brisa S-1000&quot;) only commenced later. &quot;Brisa&quot; comes from the Spanish/Portuguese word for &quot;breeze&quot;. The Brisa was equipped with a 1.0-liter Mazda engine, a bigger 1.3-liter engine was later added to the line up. Production came to an end after the new military dictator Chun Doo-hwan enforced industry consolidation, meaning Kia had to give up passenger cars and focus entirely on light trucks.

The original version of the Brisa received a slightly different front end from the original Familia, featuring twin headlights. Later, single headlights were used. In total, 31,017 Brisa passenger cars were built. Including the pickups increases the totals to 75,987, of which a total of 1,526 were exported. Exports, Kia&#x27;s first, began with a shipment of 31 Brisa B-1000 pickups to Qatar in 1975. The Brisa (along with the pickup model, typically called &quot;Master&quot; in export) was also exported to Colombia and Greece.


=== Mazda Grand Familia/Savanna/808/818/RX-3 ===
In September 1971, Mazda introduced the &quot;Mazda Grand Familia&quot; and the Mazda Savanna to better compete with the Toyota Corolla, and the Nissan Sunny in North America. The Grand Familia/Savanna was intended to replace the smaller Familia. But with the advent of the 1970s energy crisis, the Familia began to experience an increase in sales due to better fuel economy, so the Familia remained in Japan and Europe, and Mazda decided to offer the Grand Familia and Savanna as larger, performance enhanced alternatives. It is better known by its export market names Mazda 808, 818, and RX-3. The Grand Familia was also built by Kia with the 1272 cc engine from October 1975, originally as the Brisa II and later as the K303.
=== 1973–1977 (Familia Presto FA3 series 2)===


A facelifted version of the Familia Presto was announced in September 1973, a month before the 1973 oil crisis. It was basically an updated version of the 1970 Familia Presto, reintroduced with 60 mm wider bodywork and reworked front and rear designs. It was promoted and marketed as the &quot;Widebody&quot; in Japan. These changes were made only to the sedans and coupé, while the van/wagon and trucks remained in production and retaining the original narrower bodywork with minor changes. The Familia Presto continued using the &quot;Mazda 1000/1300&quot; name in most export markets, &quot;Mazda Marella&quot; name was also retained in Finland.

The Rotary Presto sedan/coupé was discontinued in Japan, having been replaced by the larger Grand Familia-based Mazda Savannah. The piston-engined 1000/1300 and rotary-engined R100 coupés were also replaced by 808/818/RX-3 coupé for export market. This generation was not available in North America and replaced by the bigger 808/Mizer/RX-3. Developed to meet new stricter emissions standards in the domestic market, the Presto featured the 1272 cc TC engine or the by now familiar, pushrod 1.0-litre PB unit. Power outputs in Japan (JIS gross) are and respectively, and (DIN) for export markets.

Production of the second generation Familia ended in January 1977, but not before another minor facelift and emissions scrubbing had taken place in February 1976. This changes were not applied for export market. After this change, only the larger engine with lean-burn technology was available in the home market, now with (JIS gross) and labelled Familia Presto 1300AP (for &quot;Anti Pollution&quot;).

== Third generation (FA4; 1977–1980) ==
The Familia AP (323 in most of the world, GLC for &quot;Great Little Car&quot; in North America) debuted in January 1977 as a rear-wheel-drive subcompact, replacing both the Grand Familia (818) and the preceding Familia (1000/1300). There was a choice of hatchbacks and station wagon bodies, both available with a three- or five-door bodystyle. The station wagon version was a bit later, first being introduced in June 1978, which also meant that the commercial versions based on the 1970 Familia could finally be retired. Three Mazda engines were available, the 985 cc PC, 1,272 cc TC, and the 1415 cc UC (introduced in March 1978). The 1.0-liter unit was only made for export markets. The new Familia shared many parts with the older Mazda Grand Familia. This was the first appearance of the 323 name, for export markets only.

The Familia AP was marketed to a new kind of youthful Japanese consumer, and sold very well at home as well as abroad. Nonetheless, the cars traditional rear-wheel-drive underpinnings limited interior space and betrayed themselves in having a very narrow track when compared to the body. The FA4 was somewhat of an interim solution while Mazda worked on a front-wheel-drive car, but still managed to sell around 890,000 examples in its three full years of production.

In June 1979, the 323/Familia underwent a facelift, replacing the previous round headlights with rectangular units which were designed as a single unit along with the grille. The new style was in line with that of the recently released Mazda Capella/626 (CB). Other minor differences occurred along with the facelift.

The range was replaced in 1980, however, the station wagon models continued in production until 1986.

The FA4-series Familia/323 was available in several body variants:
* Five-door four-seat hatchback
* Three-door four-seat hatchback
* Five-door four-seat station wagon (also as a van in Japan)
* Three-door four-seat station wagon
* Three-door two-seat van with an extended roof profile

Several of these were available in multiple trim levels.

Engines:
* 1.0 L PC, / – export only
* 1.3 L TC (1977.01–1980) / in Japan
* 1.4 L UC (1978.03–1980) in Japan

In Australia the 1.3 had at 5700 rpm while the bigger 1.4, introduced in July 1978, offered at a somewhat lower engine speed of 5500 rpm. The 1.4 was accompanied by the new, better-equipped CS model which was only available with five-door bodywork.

Van engines:
* 1.3 L TC (1978.06–1986) JIS (1979), JIS (net, later years), DIN (export models)
* 1.4 L UC (1978.06–1986) JIS (1979), JIS (net, later years)
* 1.5 L E5 (1982.10–1986) (DIN, wagon/van only)

A five-speed manual gearbox was introduced later as an alternative to the original four-speed manual gearbox. At the same time the original round sealed beam headlights were replaced with square sealed beam units on all models except the van, together with a general styling and mechanical upgrade. A three-speed automatic gearbox was also available on the bigger engined models, it was first introduced (on the 1400) at the end of June 1978.

When the next generation front-wheel-drive Familia/323/GLC models were released in 1980, the wagon and van models continued unchanged, due to Mazda not developing wagon models for the newer range. A facelift however was given to the wagons in 1981, which gave the models the front clip (albeit with different bumpers) of the front-wheel-drive models. Production of the wagons continued to 1986, when a new front-wheel-drive model was introduced. Originally available with the 1.3- TC and 1.4-liter UC engines, in export markets the larger unit was replaced with the new 1.5-liter E5 engine for the 1983 model year.

;North America
For the United States, the GLC, advertised as the Great Little Car, was only offered with one engine at a time. The new GLC overlapped with the old-style Mizer for part of 1977 and was produced through 1980 before being replaced by the next-generation GLC. The marketing campaign in the U.S. had the words &quot;Great Little Car&quot; set to the tune of Spanish Flea. Thanks to the safety bumpers mandated by federal regulations, the 1979 base GLC three-door weighed in at and was long. The station wagon continued to be offered until the 1986 model year.

For the 1979 model year, the original 1272 cc four was replaced with a 1415 cc engine producing . In addition to three- and five-door hatchbacks, as well as the wagon, there was also a GLC Sport version which offered a five-speed rather than the four-speed manual or the three-speed automatic installed in other versions. After the introduction of the front-wheel-drive GLC the carry-over station wagon&#x27;s engine was replaced with the new E5 model of 1490 cc, although claimed power dropped somewhat, to .

;South Africa
In South Africa, the five-door-only 323 proved an immediate success. The 1.3 was gradually replaced by the larger 1.4 from July 1978, while a Special and a CS model were added at the low and high ends of the lineup respectively, complementing the existing De Luxe models. Well-equipped versions of the 1978 facelift model were sold as the &quot;323 GLC&quot; in South Africa. A 1600-cc model was also available in South Africa – however this model did not have a Mazda engine, unlike the rest of the range. To satisfy that country&#x27;s local content regulations, a locally built Mitsubishi Saturn 1.6-liter unit was used. This produces and was the most powerful engine to be installed in the FA-series Familia/323. It arrived in early 1979, but period testers felt that the less-revvy 1.6 provided very little that the 1.4 did not offer, and could not be considered to be worth the price. Fuel consumption dropped, while top speed of was only marginally higher than the of the smaller version. Sigma also fielded a rotary-engined 323 in the South African national rally championship.

;Indonesia

In Indonesia the third-generation Familia was marketed by Indomobil Group twice, the first time as the 323 hatchback from 1977 to 1980, and the second time around as the low-cost alternative of the popular Toyota Kijang and fellow Indomobil Group product&#x27;s Suzuki Carry Extra/Futura; low-price &quot;Mazda MR90&quot; (hatchback) between December 1990 to 1993, &quot;Mazda Baby Boomers&quot; (hatchback) between 1993 and 1995, and as the &quot;Mazda Vantrend&quot; (station wagon and special limited order as high roof van or pickup truck) between 1993 and 1997. The Vantrend and its derivatives were also marketed as the Mazda M1400. The name MR90 stands for &quot;Mobil Rakyat 90&quot; (people&#x27;s car for the 1990s) as it was intended to become a national car project. This was scuppered by the appearance of the Timor 515 project. The MR90 and its successors did see limited exports to small markets such as Fiji and Sri Lanka. There was also a better equipped GLX version available. The Baby Boomers was a lightly facelifted variant with new bumpers and a rear spoiler, for a more sporty appearance overall.

The 1990s versions built by Indomobil have modernized headlights (same as on the Mazda 626 (GC), while Vantrend adopted the pre-facelift North American market quad headlights version) and bumpers. These alterations mean that the overall length increased, up to for the MR90 hatchback. Only the UC 1.4-liter engine was offered, in combination with a five-speed transmission. The project was suggested to and given the green light by Mazda&#x27;s Senior Managing Director Keiji Asano while he was on a trip to Indonesia in 1986. Sold alongside the seventh generation 323, an MR90 cost less than half the price of the newer model, but still more expensive than Toyota Kijang and Suzuki Carry &quot;minibuses&quot; as the country imposed 30% tax for sedans. In the past hatchback and wagon were classified as sedan Indonesia, but then revised as &quot;minibus&quot; in early 2000s. This changes boosting the sales of hatchbacks and started the downfall of sedans popularity in Indonesia.

Around this time, a coachbuilder company called PT. Marvia Graha Motor (owned by Marvy Apandi, the executive director of Indomobil Group) built around 50 units replica of Porsche 911 (964) based on MR90 hatchbacks. While retaining the original 1.4-liter engine, 5-speed manual gearbox, suspension and dashboard (later models has 964 dashboard replica), the body was made from fiberglass by using the 964 production tools from VW Group. At that time Indomobil had a trial by assembling two Porsche 964 and planned to build Porsche and Audi in Indonesia to compete with BMW and Mercedes-Benz. The plan was terminated because the production quality was below VW Group&#x27;s standard.
== Fourth generation (BD; 1980–1986) ==
The fourth generation Familia (BD), first shown on 2 June 1980, was entirely new – it was Mazda&#x27;s first front-engine, front-wheel-drive subcompact car, and was available as a hatchback and sedan. It was developed with input from Ford, which in 1979 had acquired a stake in the Japanese manufacturer, and had a twin called the Ford Laser (and Ford Meteor, for its four-door sedan model in Australia).

At its introduction in 1980, it won the first Car of the Year Japan Award.

The new Mazda E engine-series, loosely based on the preceding PC/TC/UC series, was developed expressly for the BD and was offered in three different displacements. The smallest 1.1-liter E1 unit was reserved for certain export markets where the tax structures suited it. Chassis codes were BD1011/BD1031/BD1051 depending on the engine installed.

Engines:
* &quot;E1&quot;, 1 barrel, / 
* &quot;E3&quot;, 2 barrel, / 
* &quot;E5&quot;, 2 barrel, / 
* &quot;E5S&quot;, 2x2 barrel, / 
The most powerful version was marketed as the &quot;323 GT&quot; in European markets. The Familia/323 underwent a facelift in January 1983.

For the Japanese market other top end models were offered, originally the three-door Familia XGI with a 1,500 cc single cam, multi-point fuel-injected engine. In June 1983 the turbocharged XGI Turbo was added, Mazda&#x27;s first turbocharged piston engine. It had a particularly small turbocharger, for better low-end response. Period commentators complimented its linear and smooth power delivery. The XG Turbo also received a suitably updated chassis and wheels to handle the . The Familia sedan and their twin, the Ford Laser S, was also offered with the same specifications but in limited numbers. Claimed outputs in the Japanese market were considerably higher than in export countries, due to the differing JIS standard rather than DIN. Period sources suggest subtracting ten percent from the JIS numbers.

This particular Familia was a strong comeback for Mazda in the Japanese market, even outselling the Toyota Corolla on several occasions. The four-door sedan was equipped with a reverse-rake front grille and lights in the Japanese market, to make it appear more &quot;senior&quot;. The same front design was used for the GA/GB Ford Meteor.

The 1980 Familia/323 was the first front-engine, front-wheel-drive vehicle from Mazda since the R130. This generation of 323 was &quot;Wheels&quot; magazine&#x27;s car of the year for 1980. The existing station wagon version, simply a facelifted version of the previous rear-drive model (fitted with the square headlights and grille from the new model), was sold in parallel with the BD. The wagon was available with either three or five doors and was equipped either with the old 1272 cc TC engine or the 1415 cc UC. The 1.4 was replaced from 1983 with the newly developed 1490 cc E5 engine. The TC 1.3 produces while the larger versions offer . By 1985, the old 1.3 was replaced by the 1296 cc E3 engine with ; it was only available with the three-door estate body.

===Export markets===
The front-wheel-drive 323 was introduced in Europe in September 1980, nearly simultaneously to its cousin and competitor the Ford Escort. The four-door sedan version followed in January 1981, and one month later automatic-equipped models became available to European buyers.


=== GLC (1981–1985) ===

The equivalent American Mazda GLC (Great Little Car) appeared in the 1981 model year, although the rear-wheel drive wagon also continued to be offered. It was only offered with a single engine – the twin-barrel 1.5-liter with —and lasted through 1985, after which it was replaced by the next-generation Mazda 323. With this, the GLC nameplate was retired. The BD was the only front-wheel drive Mazda vehicle using the GLC name. Originally it was offered with three- or five-door bodywork, in standard, Custom, Custom L, or Sport equipment levels. The five-door only came as a Custom and was sold only in Hawaii and Puerto Rico. All cars received exposed rectangular sealed-beam units. The later four-door sedan, introduced for 1983, was available in Custom, Custom L, and Sport models.

The Sport received blacked out trim, a steering wheel borrowed from the RX-7, full instrumentation, and a special rear interior which closely integrates the side trim with the rear seat design – an early iteration of a design philosophy taken to its extreme with the 1988 Persona and the 1990 Eunos Cosmo. Unlike the sporting 323s in other markets, the Sport only received special hubcaps, rather than alloy wheels. For 1982, the Sport was made to live up to its name a little bit more, with the installation of a front anti-roll bar and cast aluminum wheels. The five-door GLC gained a fully carpeted trunk for 1982.
== Fifth generation (BF; 1985–1994) ==
In January 1985, the fifth generation Familia/323 was fully renewed. It was available as a hatchback (with three or five doors) or four-door sedan only for the first year; wagon and cabriolet models were added in November 1985 and March 1986 respectively. The wagon was commonly sold as a light van in Japan, but for the first time it was also available as a passenger-oriented wagon model in the Japanese domestic market. In January 1987 a personal coupé version with its own bodywork, the Étude, was added. In February 1987 the Familia range underwent a light facelift that included replacing the old E engines with the more modern B series. In some markets, such as Indonesia, the E engine continued to be installed after the facelift.

This generation of the Familia/323 was also available in a version with a turbocharged DOHC engine, with either front- or four-wheel drive, producing . The 4WD version (sold in either a light-weight GT or fully optioned GT-X grade) introduced in October 1985, saw some success in rally&#x27;s Group A category. A limited production Japanese-only homologation special, the 4WD GT-Ae, appeared May 1988 and offered an additional ten horsepower and viscous rear limited slip differential (similar to the later BG Familia). Full time four-wheel drive was also available in more pedestrian versions like the 1.5 hatchback.

There was also a 1.7-liter diesel version available with at 4300 rpm and at 2800 rpm. Introduced in July 1985, it is a naturally aspirated indirect injection engine.

As with the earlier 323 Wagon/Familia Van, the wagon (BW) skipped the succeeding generational change and continued to be available alongside the next generation in most markets. It was later updated with a new grille and lights and continued to be available until 1994/95. When the saloons and hatchbacks received new engines in late 1987, the vans continued to use the old E-series units for a little longer.

A factory-built convertible body was introduced in March 1986 in both Mazda 323 and Ford Laser (323 panels from firewall back) versions, initially running the 1.5-liter turbocharged &quot;E5T&quot; engine but later switching to the 1.6-liter DOHC &quot;B6D&quot;.

===Export markets===
The 1985 Familia spawned a Ford Laser twin sold in the Asia-Pacific. The Laser sedan and wagon were nearly identical to the Familia but with a Ford grille. By contrast the Laser hatchback model, which was sold in the U.S. as the Mercury Tracer used completely different panels from the Familia&#x27;s.

;United States
The new 323 arrived in the United States for the 1986 model year and continued to be available through 1989. The naming practice was now aligned with most of Mazda&#x27;s export markets, with the 323 badge replacing GLC. For 1987 the wagon version was added to the lineup, with the same mechanicals as the hatchbacks and sedans. In 1988, Mazda added a turbocharged option in the GT and GTX model as well as four-wheel drive in the GTX model. The GTX was the first four-wheel drive passenger car Mazda offered in the United States. The GT and GTX featured a turbocharged and intercooled 1.6 liter 16-valve DOHC 4-cylinder engine rated at and only was available with a 5-speed manual transmission.

;South Africa
The model remained in production in South Africa, as an entry-level model until 2003. It was also sold there as the &quot;Midge&quot;, the &quot;Sting&quot;, and as the &quot;Ford Tonic&quot;. A locally designed pick-up based on the Familia front end, called the Rustler was also produced, and sold as the &quot;Ford Bantam&quot;. From 1991 to 1994 Samcor also produced and sold the 323 with the 2.0 L 16-valve DOHC FE engine from the Mazda 626 and badged it &quot;200i&quot;. Along with the 2.0 L 16-valve DOHC engine there were upgrades to the suspension and braking system. Still, the 1.6-liter GT-Ae homologation car was more powerful.

This South African built model was also sold in Australia between 1989 and 1991 with minor changes, the most noticeable one being the front indicators having a clear color rather than the normal amber. These models were labeled BF as opposed to the next generation&#x27;s BG.

===Sao Penza===
The South African-made model was exported to the United Kingdom between 1991 and 1993 as the &quot;Sao Penza&quot; and fitted with a 1.3-liter fuel-injected engine. The importer was Automotive Holdings, a subsidiary of Mazda Cars Ltd, the official Mazda UK importer. It was a rebadged version of the Mazda 323, imported from South Africa, where the 1985 model was still assembled by Samcor (now Ford Motor Company of South Africa), although it had ceased to be imported to the UK in 1989. Both four-door saloon and five-door hatchback versions were available, with fairly basic specifications.

It went on sale in the United Kingdom in July 1991, with 1200 vehicles expected to be sold that year. Marketed as &quot;Japanese technology you can afford&quot;, it was sold at £7,500 – around £2,000 cheaper than the equivalent version of the new Mazda 323. However, it struggled to compete in a segment of the market dominated by South Korean and Eastern European models. Its prices were not low enough to attract strong sales and it was withdrawn from sale in 1993. Just over 1,000 were sold and as of 2019 there is just one MOT&#x27;d car left on the road (a blue 1.3L 5-door) 

The car uses the Mazda B3 four-cylinder engine. Maximum power is at 5500 rpm, providing a top speed of .
== Sixth generation (BG; 1989–1994) ==
The sixth generation Familia (BG) included three-door hatchback, five-door fastback, and four-door sedan variants, none of which share any body panels. The new five-door fastback version was called the Familia Astina in Japan and was sold as the 323F or 323 Astina elsewhere. The BF wagon (originally introduced in 1985) was carried over in facelifted form, although Ford marketed a wagon on the new platform as part of the North American Escort line.

The BG Familia was available with front- or all-wheel drive and a 1.3 L, 1.5 L, 1.6 L, or 1.8 L gas or 1.7 L diesel engine. Later, a turbocharged engine was added, especially developed for homologation purposes for the World Rally Championship, Group A category. The four-wheel drive models (including the turbocharged GT-X) were introduced in August 1989. In Japan, the SOHC 1.6 L was only available coupled to four-wheel drive. With a carburettor, it offered , the same as the lower-spec 1.5 L, but with a somewhat larger torque curve. In Europe, only the 1.8 L (in naturally aspirated, 106 PS form or either of the turbocharged variants) was offered with four-wheel-drive.

Trim lines in Japan included &quot;Clair&quot;, &quot;Interplay&quot;, &quot;Supreme&quot;, &quot;Pepper&quot;, and &quot;GT-X&quot;. The Supreme model was only available in saloon form and features the larger bumpers and bootlid-mounted number plate recess of the American market Protegé. Carburetted models were mostly dropped in 1991, replaced by single-point fuel injection.

In North America, the 323 sedan became the Protegé, while the 323 hatchback kept its name. There, and in the Philippines, base (SE/DX), 4WD and top-line LX models were available. The 1990 base model has the SE name and uses the B8 1.8 L SOHC engine that has 16 valves and hydraulic lifters. In 1991, the base model name was changed to &quot;DX&quot;. 4WD models existed for the 1990 and 1991 model years, with the SOHC engine and rear disc brakes. The LX version of the Protegé included a BP 1.8 L DOHC 16-valve engine . LX models also have power windows and door locks and 14-inch wheels. Vented front and solid rear disc brakes, larger front brakes, larger clutch, equal-length driveshafts, dual outlet muffler, body-color door handles and mirrors, fold-down rear center armrest, driver&#x27;s vanity mirror, and larger stabilizer bars. A sunroof and 14-inch aluminum alloy wheels were options on LX models.

BG models that were assembled in New Zealand came with glass headlights instead of plastic, and a 240 km/h speedometer.

Production of the BG Familia mostly ended on 24 May 1994, although the 1.3 L hatchback was kept in production until October 1996 as there was originally no 1.3 L option in the following generation. In Australia, the BG model continued to be sold until 1996 as a more affordable alternative to the newer BH model.

In China, the BG model was sold as the Haima CA7130 and the CA7160. They were produced from 1998 until 2004. Power came from the 1.3 L &quot;8A-FE&quot; or 1.6 L B6 sourced from Toyota and Mazda respectively.

===Familia Infini===
The Mazda Familia Infini was produced from 1989 until 1990 as a special Japan only special sport trim line of the four-door Familia. Much of the Infini trim is similar to the American LX version, equipped with the 1.8 DOHC BP-ZE engine and close ratio LSD 5-speed manual transmission. The Infini was upgraded with a viscous limited-slip differential, stiffer suspension package, and bonnet/headlight style similar to the 323 hatchbacks. In 1994, these were facelifts were adopted on all Familia sedan models. The Infini came only in dark green color with unique Infini trim grille, rear spoiler, &quot;lightweight&quot; carpet, without sound deadener, and with Infini (∞) logos on horn button, front grille, wheel caps, and bootlid. There were also unique factory front clear indicators, a Momo steering wheel, BBS 15-inch rims, suede interior with GTX style seat trim, leather gearboot &amp; knob, front and rear strut braces, 22-mm sway bars front and rear, rear tie bar, and a 7,100 rpm redline tachometer, as well as four-wheel disc brakes. Around 1,000 Infinis were produced, and preceded Mazda&#x27;s ɛ̃fini Japanese dealership network.

=== Familia GT-X, GT-A, GT-R, GT-Ae===

For Group A rallying, Mazda made two main homologation models. The JDM GTX model was released in 1990 and featured four-wheel drive, viscous limited-slip differentials and a turbocharged 1.8 L BP engine which produced . Mazda also Produced 300 GT-A variants to celebrate the launch of the BG Familia GTX and its rally debut. These were stripped of most luxuries and delivered with Mazdaspeed torsen rear differential, short ratio gearbox, roll cage, harnesses, grill mounted fog lights. A graphics pack was also available.

The JDM-only GT-R model was released in 1992, featuring a number of enhancements over the GTX model: an aggressive front bumper, grill and bonnet vents, updated rear bumper, wheel flares, stiffer suspension and anti-roll bars with thicker cross members, and homologated five-stud wheel hubs with larger brakes. The interior was fitted with leather and suede seats, and had the option of replacing the cupholder with a 3-gauge cluster. In addition, the GTR has stronger connecting rods and pistons, larger oil squirters, larger nose crank, larger oil cooler, sodium filled valves, a baffled inlet manifold, larger injectors, removed boost cut, front-mounted intercooler, and an IHI VJ-23 ball bearing water-cooled turbocharger. Power was increased to .

As per the first GTX, 300 special version GT-R&#x27;s were produced known as GT-Ae&#x27;s. These shared the power output of the GT-R, but were lighter, fitted with closer ratio gearboxes, and featured a larger top spoiler with a gap between the hatch and the spoiler to direct air to the new lower spoiler. The wiring for ABS, air conditioning, power mirrors, power windows, power locks, and sunroof was removed. Instead of using the GTR&#x27;s leather interior, the lighter cloth interior of the GTX was used.

=== Astina/323F ===
A sporty, five-door fastback version was called the Familia Astina in Japan. Elsewhere, it was called 323F and 323 Astina. A luxury version was also sold in Japan as the Eunos 100. The car was produced from 1989 until 1994 before being replaced by the Lantis. A key feature of the Astina/F is the distinct front end with its pop-up headlights. There were carbureted or fuel injected SOHC versions available of the 1.5-, 1.6- and 1.8-liter engines, as well as a version of the 1.8 with DOHC and fuel injection. Unlike the standard Familia saloons and three-door hatchback, the Astina never came from the factory with a turbo or with four-wheel drive.

Taillight arrangement varies from market to market, the main difference being the third brake light in the spoiler and two brake lights per cluster (Japanese spec), rather than one.

In the UK the 323F was launched with 1.6L 16v in either LX, GLX or GLXi trim or as 1.8i 16vGT. In Indonesia it is called Astina GT and RX3 (Special model made in Indonesia like as front &amp; rear bumper and side skirt) with BP05 engine 1.8L

== Seventh generation (BH/BA; 1994–1998) ==
The seventh generation was released for the Japanese domestic market in June 1994 with front-wheel drive. The sedan version was again sold as the &quot;Mazda Protegé&quot; in North America, as the Mazda Artis in some South American markets, as the &quot;Mazda Étude&quot; in South Africa and as Mazda Allegro in Colombia. Originally there was a three-door coupé (323C/Familia Neo) available, but after sluggish sales, a hatchback version based on the facelifted Familia sedan replaced it.

An unusual JDM station wagon model appeared in September 1994, with the discontinuation of the 1985-generation station wagon. The Mazda Familia Van offered after this year was a rebadged Nissan AD/Wingroad/Sunny California, which was essentially the station wagon version of the Nissan Sunny/Sentra/Pulsar (N14). A new model appeared in the same month, when a lean-burn version called the GS-L arrived: its Z5-DEL engine produces , three down on the regular Z5-DE, but gas mileage improved by ten to fifteen percent. Another loan was the 1.7-liter intercooled turbo-diesel engine purchased from Isuzu for use in sedans since October 1994. These models have a prominent hood scoop. At about the same time a all-wheel-drive model was introduced in Japan, either with a 1.6-liter petrol or the Isuzu turbo-diesel. The 4WD cars can be easily identified by having been equipped with the federalized front (but not rear) bumper, including side marker lights.

This generation grew considerably, with the four-door sedan&#x27;s wheelbase only 5 millimetres short of the then-current Mazda 626, a mid-size car. The car was not originally offered with a 1.3-liter engine in Japan, with the lineup beginning with the bigger 1.5-liter. To close this gap in the lineup, the BG hatchback with the 1.3-liter engine was kept available until October 1996, when the new hatchback model was introduced (323P) and the smaller engine was made available.

The rare North American ES model came with the Miata (NA)&#x27;s 1.8-liter twin-cam engine (though the internals were not entirely the same), all-wheel disc brakes, and dual stabilizer bars. The same car went on sale in Australia in the second half of 1994 with a fully featured BP-ZE engine. The Protegé became classified as a &quot;compact car&quot; for the 1995 model year in North America.

A version with Mazdaspeed accessories was released in Japan and Philippines. It came equipped with Mazdaspeed wrap around bodykit, Mazdaspeed rear spoiler, Momo steering wheel, 15-inch Rota Astral wheels wrapped in 195/55R15 Bridgestone Potenza RE01 tires, Mazdaspeed strut tower bar, Eibach springs, gas-charged shock absorbers, swaybars and Mazdaspeed exhaust made by Yumex.

The Familia/Protegé/323 was facelifted in October 1996, with a newer somewhat calmer style. This generation was discontinued in 1998 in most markets, but continued to be available in some markets until 1999 or 2000. For example, the 3-door hatchback was available in Europe until October 2000.

;Models
* Four-door sedan (called the Protegé in North America, 323S in Europe, 323 Protegé in Australia, 323 Lantis/Familia in Indonesia, Allegro in Colombia, Artis in Chile and Étude in South Africa)
* Three-door coupé hatchback (Familia Neo in Japan, 323C in Europe and 323 Neo in Canada)
* Three-door hatchback (called the 323P in Europe)

=== Familia Neo/323C/323 Neo ===
The Familia Neo started production for the Japanese domestic market in 1994 (axed in 1996), and was also sold as the 323C in Europe and the 323 Neo in Canada. Ford released a rebadged version which was mechanically the same although different bumpers, headlights and bonnet were fitted, badged as the Ford Laser Lynx in Japan and Australia, and the Ford Aztec in Taiwan. This model was only available as the Ford Laser-Lynx in the Australian market, as Mazda already had the 323 Astina Hatch filling the gap for a hatchback in the Mazda range. To contradict this, Mazda Australia also offered two 323 sedans, the Astina/Lantis hardtop and the 323 Protegé until production of both models ceased in 1998.

It featured a rear hatch with a divided glass, much like the Honda CR-X. Aesthetically the Familia Neo was very close in looks to a Mazda Lantis/323F and equated to a three-door version and also shared the Lantis suspension. The top specced Familia Neo was fitted with a DOHC 1839 cc BP-ZE engine which produced around (depending on the market), and this was the same engine fitted to the base model Mazda Lantis. It was also sold for a single year (1995) in Canada as 323 Neo GS. In Europe it was named Mazda 323C (for coupé), available for sale until September 1998 and it was equipped with 1.3 L SOHC, 1.5 L DOHC 16V, and 1.8 L DOHC 16V engine.

=== Lantis/Astina/323F ===

A five-door hatchback and four-door sedan, both featuring pillarless doors and distinct sheetmetal from other 323s, was sold in Japan as the Mazda Lantis, in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa as the Mazda 323 Astina, in Colombia as the Mazda Allegro and in Europe as the Mazda 323F.

They were built on platforms distinct from the other 323s and actually appeared nearly a year before the new Familia, in September 1993. The bodyshape was designed by former Porsche designers. The Lantis was on the CB, a minor update of the CA that underpinned the luxury Mazda Xedos 6 and Eunos 500. The European 323F was designated BA, but was actually almost identical to the CB, and had little to do with other B platforms. These models were sold with the 1.5 L 1.6L and 1.8 L engines seen in the rest of the 323 range, as well as a 2.0 L (KF) V6 shared with the Eunos 500. The 2.0L V6 still remains one of the smallest V6 engines put into a production car.
== Eighth generation (BJ; 1998–2003) ==

The eighth generation &quot;BJ&quot; Familia was introduced on 9 June 1998 and released on 29 September 1998 as a 1999 model. Body styles included a four-door sedan and a five-door S-Wagon (sold as the Protegé5 in the United States and Canada, 323F in Europe, and as the Astina NU in some Asian countries). In Japan there was also a traditional five-door &quot;light van&quot; (station wagon for commercial use) sold under the Familia nameplate, but this car was simply a rebadged Nissan. A &quot;4EC&quot; automatic transmission and two five-speed manual transmissions were available. All-wheel drive is optional.

The Japanese Mazda Familia had all-wheel drive as an option. In North America, the ES&#x27;s engine was still 1.8 liters, but for the eighth generation it was a smaller version of the 626&#x27;s engine (the FP) rather than the sportier engine shared with the Miata which had been used previously. The rear disc brakes of the ES were downgraded to drums.

Mazda 323s were used as police cars by some police departments such as the Singapore Police Force as Fast Response Cars (FRCs) until they were retired in 2016.

The Familia Van and Familia Business Wagon were introduced for 2000, and continued to be supplied by Nissan under an OEM deal, based on the Wingroad.

===Facelift===
In 2001, the entire line was facelifted with new styling, a revised suspension, and a new audio system. For North America, ES models received rear disc brakes and a stiffer suspension. The 1.8 L engine was increased to 2.0 L for the ES models, and was optional on the LX model, becoming the 2.0LX. The standard 2001 Protegé LX engine was the carryover 1.6 L ZM-DE.

A 2.0-liter, gasoline engine appeared in 2001 on the Japanese market Sport 20. In 1999, Ford of Japan ceased to market Mazda-based models, and the Ford Laser, along with the Ixion, Telstar, and Festiva, was discontinued.

=== Mazdaspeed Protegé===
For the 2001 model year in North America, Mazda introduced the limited-edition Protegé MP3 featuring a new sport-tuned suspension, 17-inch Racing Hart wheels, and a gain for a total of , which was achieved through a tuned factory ECU which advances ignition timing requiring high octane rating gasoline, cat-back exhaust by Racing Beat, and removal of the Mazda VTCS system. The MP3 also came from the factory with a complete 450-watt Kenwood powered MP3 stereo with powered subwoofer. A total of 1,500 were produced – 1,000 finished in blue, and 500 painted yellow.

2001 saw the North American introduction of the hatchback, called Protegé5 with the same 2.0 L engine offering / this year and a slightly revised interior. In 2002, most Protegés (including the 5) received the 2.0 L engine, although the SE in Canada had the 1.6 L.

In 2003, Mazdaspeed introduced the Mazdaspeed Protegé, an update to the Protegé MP3 that had a / turbocharged engine, shared the MP3&#x27;s full Racing Beat suspension, redesigned wheels, larger four-wheel disc brakes, and a Kenwood stereo system that included an amplifier along with a rear-deck mounted sub. Mazda then followed with a mid year change dubbed the &quot;2003.5.&quot; This model included a different aero-kit, the same Racing Hart wheels, but with a darker color, and custom interior pieces. In total, there were 4,500 Mazdaspeed Protegé models produced of which 1,750 were painted Black/Orange for first version and 2,750 of the mid-year model that were finished in Yellow/Titanium/Blue/Silver.

The 2003 ES model received a Tiptronic automatic transmission as an option, as well as a new wheel design appearing on models with the alloy rim option. This was also the last year of production for the Protegé.

===Post-2003===
Production ended on 2 October 2003 and the whole Familia line were replaced by the Mazda3 in the same month. The eighth generation Familia continued to be produced by Ford Lio Ho in Taiwan as the &quot;Mazda Isamu Genki&quot; until 2008 (sold as hatch and sedan and with little or no styling differences to the original 1998 production model). It was also badged as the &quot;Ford Activa&quot;, which, unlike the Ford Laser, had no styling changes from the 323, except for the badges. In Southeast Asia, a version of the last Laser continued to be assembled in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines as the Ford Lynx.

This generation remained in production in some South American countries (Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela), badged as the Mazda Allegro. Each Allegro keeps in the styling of the last generation 323/Protegé/Astina/Familia. In Colombia, production of the Mazda 323 continued until 2003, built by its local subsidiary, the Compañía Colombiana Automotriz.

Chinese company FAW Haima Automobile Co., Ltd. produces a restyled version of the Familia/323 called Haima Family. It is equipped with a 1.6 L gasoline engine mated with a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic gearbox. Another version called the Haima Happin went on sale for the 2010–2012 model years. The Happin was equipped with a 1.3 L engine and a five-speed manual gearbox.

<text>Wrestling is a martial art, combat sport, and form of entertainment that involves grappling with an opponent and striving to obtain a position of advantage through different throws or techniques, within a given ruleset. Wrestling involves different grappling-type techniques, such as clinch fighting, throws and takedowns, joint locks, pins, and other grappling holds. Many different wrestling techniques have been incorporated into martial arts, combat sports, and military systems. 

Wrestling comes in different forms, the most popular being professional wrestling, which is a form of athletic theatre. Other legitimate competitive forms include Greco-Roman, freestyle, judo, sambo, folkstyle, catch, shoot, luta livre, submission, sumo, pehlwani, &quot;shuai jiao&quot;, and more. Wrestling first appeared in the ancient Olympic Games as an event during the 18th Olympiad in 708 BC. There are a wide range of styles with varying rules, with both traditional historic and modern styles. The term &quot;wrestling&quot; in Modern English originated from the late Old English term &quot;wræstlunge&quot; .

== History ==

Wrestling represents one of the oldest forms of combat sport. The origins of wrestling go back around 15,000 to 17,000 years ago through cave drawings in France. Babylonian and Egyptian reliefs show wrestlers using various holds known in the present-day sport. Literary references to wrestling occur as early as the Old Testament and the ancient Indian Vedas. In the Book of Genesis, the Patriarch Jacob is said to have wrestled with God or an angel. The Iliad, in which Homer recounts the Trojan War of the 13th or 12th century BC, also contains mentions of wrestling. Indian epics Ramayana and Mahabharata contain references to martial arts including wrestling. The Yellow Emperor fought the rebel Chi You using Shuai Jiao at the Battle of Zhoulu. This early style of combat was first called &quot;jiao di&quot; (butting with horns).

In Ancient Greece wrestling occupied a prominent place in legend, literature, and philosophy. Wrestling competition, brutal in many aspects, served as the focal sport of the ancient Olympic Games. Ancient Romans borrowed heavily from Greek wrestling, but eliminated much of its brutality through implementing different rules. Wrestling is referenced throughout both Ancient Greek and Roman literature. Many philosophers and leaders practiced wrestling and/or referenced the sport frequently in their works, most notably Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, Xenophon, Epictetus, Seneca, Plutarch, and Marcus Aurelius. Dicaearchus wrote that Plato wrestled at the Isthmian games. Many of Plato&#x27;s dialogues are set in wrestling schools. Ancient Greek lyric poet Pindar wrote victory odes, grouped into four books named after the Olympian, Pythian, Isthmian, and Nemean GamesPanhellenic festivals held respectively at Olympia, Delphi, Corinth, and Nemea. These odes were composed to honor the men and youths who had enjoyed victories in wrestling, boxing, pankration and other athletic contests.

During the Middle Ages from the fifth to fifteenth century, wrestling remained popular and enjoyed the patronage of many royal families, including those of England, France, and Japan.

Early British settlers in America brought a strong wrestling tradition with them. The settlers also found wrestling to be popular among Native Americans. Amateur wrestling flourished throughout the early years of the North American colonies and would later serve as a popular activity at country fairs, holiday celebrations, and in military exercises. The first organized national wrestling tournament in the United States took place in New York City in 1888. 

Wrestling has also been an event at every modern Olympic Games since the 1904 games in St. Louis, Missouri; Greco-Roman wrestling was contested at the first modern Olympics in 1896, but not at the 1900 games. The international governing body for the sport, United World Wrestling (UWW), was established in 1912 in Antwerp, Belgium as the International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA). The first annual NCAA Wrestling Championships were held in 1928 in Ames, Iowa. USA Wrestling, located in Colorado Springs, Colorado, was established as the national governing body of U.S. amateur wrestling in 1983.

== Modern international disciplines ==
Wrestling disciplines, as defined by UWW, are broken down into two categories: international wrestling disciplines and folk wrestling disciplines. Three are Olympic disciplines: Greco-Roman wrestling, men&#x27;s freestyle wrestling and women&#x27;s freestyle wrestling. UWW also sanctions associated styles: grappling, amateur pankration, belt wrestling alysh, pahlavani wrestling, beach wrestling, and African wrestling. Sambo was given status as an international style in 1966 by FILA, UWW&#x27;s predecessor.

===Greco-Roman wrestling===
Greco-Roman (GR) is an international discipline and one of two wrestling disciplines featured in the Olympic Games. This form of wrestling prioritizes upper body attacks, with an emphasis on explosive &quot;high amplitude&quot; throws. Under the Greco-Roman ruleset, it is forbidden to attack the opponent below the belt in the execution of any action (restricting holds, trips, and active but not passive usage of the legs). Points are allotted on the basis of throw amplitude, exposure of an opponent&#x27;s back to the mat and opponent passivity. A Greco-Roman wrestler may instantly win a match by holding both of an opponent&#x27;s scapula to the mat (known as a &quot;fall&quot;). A well known Greco-Roman wrestler is Alexander Karelin from Russia.

===Freestyle wrestling===
Freestyle wrestling (FS, WW) is an international discipline and one of two wrestling disciplines featured in the Olympic Games, for both men and women. This style allows the use of the wrestler&#x27;s or his opponent&#x27;s legs in offense and defense. Freestyle wrestling has its origins in catch-as-catch-can wrestling and awards points on the basis of throw amplitude, exposure of an opponent&#x27;s back to the mat and opponent passivity. A freestyle wrestler may instantly win a match by holding both of an opponent&#x27;s scapula to the mat (known as a &quot;fall&quot;). This form of wrestling is similar to American scholastic and collegiate wrestling with freestyle wrestling having a greater emphasis on throw amplitude. Collegiate women&#x27;s wrestling uses two rulesets, freestyle in the NCAA and standard collegiate in the NCWA.

=== Submission wrestling ===

Submission Wrestling incorporates techniques and holds from a variety of wrestling disciplines. Grappling is divided into two styles: no-gi and gi. In no-gi (GNG), athletes wear shorts and a compression shirt called a rashguard. In gi grappling (GWG), athletes wear a kimono or gi. The goal of the sport is to take down and control the opponent on the ground and potentially win a submission using chokes and joint locks.

===Amateur pankration===

Pankration (PK), from the Greek words &quot;pan&quot; and &quot;kratos&quot; and meaning &quot;all of power&quot;, is a world heritage martial art which was introduced to the Ancient Olympic Games in 648 BC. Modern amateur pankration is a form of mixed martial arts (MMA) that incorporates techniques from multiple systems. Matches are fought with both grappling and striking techniques.

===Alysh belt wrestling ===

Alysh is a Turkic term for a Central Asian folk wrestling style which involves the wearing of jackets, trousers and thick belts. Throughout the contest the wrestlers must retain their hold on each other&#x27;s belt. For this reason it is also referred to as &#x27;belt wrestling alysh&#x27; or &#x27;alysh belt wrestling&#x27; (BWUWW).

=== Pahlavani wrestling ===

The origin of pahlavani wrestling goes back to ancient Persia and is said to have been practiced by mythological Iranian heroes. It combines martial arts, calisthenics, strength training, and music, and was originally used to train warriors.. It is recognized by UNESCO as among the world&#x27;s longest-running forms of sport. The best wrestlers earn the title of &quot;pahlevan&quot; (hero). It is similar to freestyle wrestling, however wrestlers wear pants which extend from the waist to below the knees and a belt. They are allowed to use or grab pants or belt as a grip, use legs, waist, clinch, leg trips and lift or throw, with the goal being to touch their opponent&#x27;s shoulders to the mat.

===Beach wrestling===
UWW, then known as FILA, codified the form of beach wrestling in 2004. Beach wrestling (BW) is standing wrestling done by wrestlers, male or female, inside a sand-filled circle measuring in diameter. The style originally mirrored the rules used before the use of wrestling mats, and beach wrestling has been regarded as the oldest version of international competitive wrestling. The wrestlers wear swimsuits rather than special wrestling uniforms. Wrestlers may also wear spandex or athletic shorts.

The international rules have been modified in 2015 by UWW, with the current rules allowing wrestlers to score points via takedowns, pushing their opponent out of bounds, or bringing the opponent down to their back. In addition to the annual World Beach Wrestling Championships, beach wrestling has been contested at Youth Olympic Games, Asian Games, Down Under Games, Mediterranean Games and at the 2019 World Beach Games.

==Folk styles==


Folk wrestling describes a traditional form of wrestling unique to a culture or geographic region of the world that UWW does not administer rules for. Examples of the many styles of folk wrestling, include Cornish wrestling, backhold wrestling (from Europe), Cumberland Wrestling and Catch-as-catch-can (from England), kurash from Uzbekistan, gushteengiri from Tajikistan, khuresh from Siberia, Lotta Campidanese from Italy, naban from Myanmar, pehlwani from India, penjang gulat from Indonesia, schwingen from Switzerland, tigel from Ethiopia, kene of the Nagas from India, shuai jiao from China, and ssireum from Korea.

Folk wrestling styles are not recognized as international styles of wrestling by UWW.

Celtic wrestling styles (e.g., Cornish wrestling, Scottish Backhold, Cumberland Wrestling, Gouren and Collar-and-elbow) are a subset of folk wrestling and have their own regulatory bodies and some are affiliated to other organisations. For example, the Cornish Wrestling Association is affiliated to the British Wrestling Association which is linked to the UWW. The International Federation of Celtic Wrestling (FILC) organises international competitions between wrestlers from these styles.

Folk styles have been international in nature. For example, there have been regular Cornish wrestling tournaments and matches in the US, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, England and Cornwall, with irregular tournaments and matches in Japan, Canada and Mexico. There have also been Inter-Celtic tournaments between Cornwall and Brittany dating back to the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520 through to the modern era with regular events since 1928.

===Oil wrestling===
Oil wrestling (), also called grease wrestling, is the Turkish national sport. It is so called because the wrestlers douse themselves with olive oil. It is related to Uzbek , Tuvan khuresh and Tatar and Bashkir (). The wrestlers, known as meaning &quot;champion&quot; wear a type of hand-stitched lederhosen called a , which are traditionally made of water buffalo hide, and most recently have been made of calfskin.

Unlike Olympic wrestling, oil wrestling matches may be won by achieving an effective hold of the . Thus, the aims to control his opponent by putting his arm through the latter&#x27;s . To win by this move is called . Originally, matches had no set duration and could go on for one or two days, until one man was able to establish superiority, but in 1975 the duration was capped at 40 minutes for the and 30 minutes for the category. If no winner is determined, another 15 minutes—10 minutes for the category—of wrestling ensues, wherein scores are kept to determine the victor.

The annual Kırkpınar tournament, held in Edirne in Turkish Thrace since 1362, is the oldest continuously running, sanctioned sporting competition in the world. In recent years this style of wrestling has also become popular in other countries.

===American collegiate wrestling===
Collegiate wrestling (also known as folkstyle wrestling) is the commonly used name of wrestling practiced at the college and university level in the United States. This style, with modifications, is also practiced at the high school and middle school levels, and also for younger participants. The term is used to distinguish the style from other styles of wrestling used in other parts of the world, and from those of the Olympic Games: Greco-Roman wrestling, and freestyle wrestling.
Some high schools in the U.S. have developed junior varsity and freshman teams alongside varsity teams. Junior varsity and freshman wrestling teams restrict competitors not only by weight, but also by age and the amount of wrestling a competitor can partake in. For example, some junior varsity and freshman competitors are not allowed in tournament competition due to the amount of mat time a wrestler would accrue in a short time period.

Women&#x27;s college wrestling in the U.S. uses freestyle wrestling rules in the NCAA and standard collegiate rules in the NCWA.

There are currently several organizations which oversee collegiate wrestling competition: Divisions I, II, and III of the NCAA, the NAIA, the NJCAA, and the NCWA. NCAA Division I wrestling is considered the most prestigious and challenging level of competition. A school chooses which athletic organization to join, although it may compete against teams from other levels and organizations during regular-season competition. The collegiate season starts in October or November and culminates with the National Championship tournament held in March.

==Professional wrestling styles==

Professional wrestling is often concluded in a raised ring; akin to boxing. Although advertised as contests, bouts are actually exhibitions with winners generally pre-determined to increase entertainment value. Legitimate wrestling skill remained a valuable bargaining chip in the wrestling industry until the late 20th century however, with occasional shoot matches (often to settle some backstage personal or business dispute) taking place in the early days of the business and still occurring well into the 1930s and 1940s and the threat to use legitimate skill to have one&#x27;s way in the ring still potent decades later.

The roots of professional wrestling lay in the catch-as-catch-can contests of the late 19th century. Whereas the Europeans favored the more controlled and classical Greco-Roman style, the Americans from the 1880s preferred the more wide-open style of wrestling that later became known as &quot;freestyle&quot;. When the best American catch wrestlers discovered they could earn money with their skills, the professional counterpart was born. Initially, the contests were similar to amateur matches, except there were no time limits, and submission and choke holds were allowed. Amateur wrestling coexisted with its professional counterpart until around the 1940s before the sport grew more theatrical. Wrestlers from the period were known as hookers or shooters due to their legitimate skills – a dwindling number have remained in the business until modern times. Popular wrestlers from this era include Martin &quot;Farmer&quot; Burns, Frank Gotch, Tom Jenkins, Charles Cutler, Joe Stecher, Earl Caddock, Stanislaus Zbyszko, Ed &quot;Strangler&quot; Lewis, Ad Santel, John Pesek, Jim Londos, Ray Steele, Dick Shikat, and transitional figure Lou Thesz.

===Sports entertainment===

Sports entertainment, sometimes referred as &quot;American-style&quot; professional wrestling, includes companies such as WWE, AEW, TNA Wrestling and ROH who run touring professional wrestling events in the United States and throughout the world. Sports entertainment matches are highly theatrical, with dramatic stories such as feuds between the athletes developed and performed as part of build-up and promotion for matches. Before its increase in popularity in the mid-1980s, professional wrestling in the United States was organised as a cartel of regional monopolies, known as &quot;territories.&quot; Wrestling in some of these areas (particularly the Southern and Midwestern United States) was performed in a relatively less theatrical more serious style, which could vary from realistically sporting to darkly violent, depending on local preference.

===British/European wrestling===

A different style of professional wrestling evolved in the United Kingdom and spread across Western Europe (where it was known as &quot;Catch&quot; in the non-English speaking countries of mainland Europe). Traditionally in this style, there was less use of storylines and angles to promote the matches which, for the most part, had the atmosphere of real wrestling competition. In many countries this form of professional wrestling achieved mainstream popularity – particularly in the United Kingdom and France where in both countries from the 1950s to the late 1980s, national television coverage made household names of its stars (it was also regularly screened on Welsh language television in Wales in the 1980s/1990s and early satellite sports channels during the same period as well as extensive home video releases in 1980s Germany/Austria) – but later declined and was supplanted both on television and in wider culture by imported American wrestling. Some promoters in the UK (and to a lesser extent France and Germany) still produce live shows in this style but face stiff competition from more American-styled rivals.

===Puroresu===

Japanese professional wrestling, also known as &quot;puroresu&quot;, is also treated more as a sport than the entertainment style of wrestling common in North America. As with British/European wrestling, there are fewer and less contrived storylines and angles and there is a similar atmosphere of realistic sporting competition. Much of this direction can be attributed to the influence of two European catch wrestlers/coaches Karl Gotch and Billy Robinson whose matches in Japan early in the 1970s inspired considerable interest in the more purist grappling element of professional wrestling. Popular Japanese wrestlers include Rikidozan, Giant Baba, Antonio Inoki, Mitsuharu Misawa, Kenta Kobashi, Shinya Hashimoto and Keiji Mutoh. Shoot style wrestling evolved from traditional puroresu in an attempt to create a combat-based style. Shoot style featured a mix of amateur and catch wrestling, kickboxing and submission grappling. Shoot style wrestling is retrospectively considered a precursor to mixed martial arts.

===Lucha libre===

Mexican professional wrestling, also known as &quot;lucha libre&quot;, is a style of wrestling using special holds (&quot;llaves&quot;) and aerial techniques. Most performers, known as &quot;luchadores&quot; (singular &quot;luchador&quot;), begin their careers wearing masks, but most will lose their masks during their careers. Traditionally a match involves the best of three rounds, with no time limit. Each luchador uses his own special wrestling style or &quot;estilo de lucha&quot; consisting of aerial attack moves, strikes and complex submission holds. Popular &quot;luchadores&quot; in Mexico have included El Santo, Blue Demon, Mil Máscaras, Perro Aguayo, Konnan, L. A. Park and Místico. Several wrestlers who performed in Mexico also had success in the United States, including Eddie Guerrero, Rey Mysterio and Alberto Del Rio.

===Circus wrestling===

In France in the 19th century, early professional wrestling shows in the Greco-Roman style were often performed at the circus by the resident strongmen. This style later spread to circuses in Eastern Europe, particularly in Russia where it was a staple part of circuses in the Soviet era, where it was often advertised as &quot;French wrestling.&quot; Ivan Poddubny achieved major stardom in his homeland and beyond during the interwar period.

==Other styles==
===Judo===
Judo is a style of wrestling which is derived from jujitsu, a Japanese martial art. As a wrestling style, judo is distinctive in that practitioners, called judoka, wear a heavy jacket and trousers, called a gi, along with a belt. The gi is used to grip the opponent in order to throw or choke them. Judo also allows some chokes and joint locks, although they are typically banned for children. Judo is a popular sport in Japan as well as in France, Russia, and eastern Europe.

===Sambo===
Sambo is a martial art that originated in the Soviet Union (specifically Russia) in the 20th century. It is an acronym for &quot;self-defence without weapons&quot; in Russian and had its origins in the Soviet armed forces. Its influences are varied, with techniques borrowed from sports ranging from the two international wrestling styles of Greco-Roman and freestyle to judo, jujitsu, European styles of folk wrestling, and even fencing. The rules for sport sambo are similar to those in competitive judo, with a variety of leg locks and defense holds from the various national wrestling styles in the Soviet Union, while not allowing chokeholds.

==Wrestling in mixed martial arts==
The rapid rise in the popularity of mixed martial arts (MMA) has increased interest in wrestling due to its effectiveness against other martial arts since the infancy of MMA, and several wrestling techniques have been specifically adapted for MMA, leading to many martial arts gyms holding MMA wrestling classes. It is considered one of the primary disciplines in MMA along with Brazilian jiu-jitsu, boxing, kickboxing/muay Thai, and judo.
Shoot wrestling, a relative of catch and freestyle wrestling, is the foundation of Shooto, a combat sport and pioneer MMA organization founded in 1985. Pancrase, another influential MMA organization based on shoot wrestling, also predates the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).

Wrestling has produced significantly more UFC champions than any other martial art. Wrestlers such as Dan Severn, Don Frye, Mark Coleman, Randy Couture, Mark Kerr, Kazushi Sakuraba, Pat Miletich, and Dan Henderson won many of the early UFC tournaments along with other accolades. Ken Shamrock won the first UFC Superfight Championship and the first King of Pancrase Openweight Championship in Japan. Other notable MMA fighters with foundations in various forms of wrestling include:

<text>The Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia (, also known by the acronym DeSUS) is a political party in Slovenia led by Ljubo Jasnič. The party claims broadly liberal values with a strong focus on the interests of the retired and the elderly. Despite being part of virtually every governmental coalition of Slovenia since it started appearing on voting ballots, the party only secured 0.66% of all votes at the most recent Slovenian parliamentary election in 2022 and thus failed to secure any seats in the National Assembly.

The party joined the European Democratic Party in February 2019.

==Overview==
DeSUS was founded in 1991 and first entered the National Assembly of Slovenia after the 1996 Slovenian parliamentary election. Since that election, DeSUS was a member of every government coalition, with the exception of the brief Bajuk minority government which lasted from June to November 2000, until 2020. From May 2005 until 2020 the party was led by Karl Erjavec, who served in various ministerial positions for most of those 15 years, making him almost synonymous with the party itself as well as one of the most recognisable politicians in Slovenia. At the party congress in January 2020, he was defeated by Agriculture minister Aleksandra Pivec who thereby assumed the leadership of the party. Upon his loss, Erjavec announced he would be leaving politics but remain an active DeSUS member. After the resignation of the Marjan Šarec minority government, DeSUS opted to form a new government with former prime minister Janez Janša with Pivec continuing on in her current ministerial position. The decision came as a surprise to some as during the latter years under Erjavec the party had been taking an increasingly oppositional stance towards Janša and SDS, despite having taken part in Janša&#x27;s 1st (2004–2008) and 2nd (2012–2013) governments, having gone as far as to explicitly campaign on an anti-Janša platform during the 2018 parliamentary election, particularly notable by party&#x27;s close campaign cooperation with Ljubljana&#x27;s mayor Zoran Janković, well known for his public opposition to Janša.

===14th Government of Slovenia===

After the party&#x27;s entry into Janša&#x27;s 3rd government the divisions within the party became increasingly public, culminating in all five of the party&#x27;s MPs as well as Health minister Tomaž Gantar calling for the resignation of Aleksandra Pivec in August 2020. During the summer, Pivec had become embroiled in a series of allegations of corruption and inappropriate behavior after making visits to a winery and the coastal town of Izola, the costs of which were covered by the private company Vina Kras and the Izola municipal government. This culminated in a public media spat between Pivec and the DeSUS parliamentary group with Pivec alleging she was being undermined by underground elements of the party and its former leader Karl Erjavec. The situation further escalated as various regional party branches voted to either support Pivec or call for her dismissal. As the national party council under the direction of Tomaž Gantar prepared to convene and vote on a motion of no confidence against Pivec and a motion to dismiss her from her position, she announced that such a dismissal would be illegitimate (as she believed only the national party congress could remove the party leader) and that she was prepared to fight it. A motion of no confidence was passed by the DeSUS national council on 22 August 2020. The vote for her dismissal was scheduled on 9 September, but Pivec resigned just before it took place and Gantar took over as acting leader (despite the party&#x27;s statute putting the three deputy leaders of the party ahead of him in the line of succession). On 5 October, she also resigned as agriculture minister and deputy prime minister as the National Assembly was set to remove her from these functions. She has since left DeSUS but vowed to remain in politics.

At the December 2020 party congress, Karl Erjavec once again became party president. The party&#x27;s MPs were opposed his idea of leaving the governmental coalition, whereas the party leadership supported it (The disagreements between the leadership and the parliamentary group continued until the conclusion of the contemporary National Assembly term in 2022, preceded by further division among MPs themselves). Erjavec left the party on 10 March 2020 and was replaced by Anton Balažek as the party president. He was later replaced by Brigita Čokl as acting president. Ljubo Jasnič was then elected in party elections on 19 June 2021 with 54 delegate votes out of 117. Despite his opposition to prime minister Janša, DeSUS &quot;de facto&quot; remained part of his coalition government. Jasnič eventually lead the party at the 2022 parliamentary election, where for the first time in its history, it secured no seats.

<doc id="735112" wikidata="Q7269479" url="?curid=735112" title="Quasi-syllogism">
<text>Quasi-syllogism is a categorical syllogism where one of the premises is &quot;singular&quot;, and thus not a categorical statement.

&quot;For example:&quot;

#All men are mortal
#Socrates is a man
#Socrates is mortal

In the above argument, while premise 1 is a categorical, premise 2 is a singular statement referring to one individual. While this is a valid logical form, it is not strictly a categorical syllogism.

Of course, it has been suggested that you can &quot;translate&quot; any singular statement into a categorical.

&quot;For example:&quot;

#Socrates is a man
#All members of a class of which the only member is Socrates are men

The above two premises may be considered identical, but the first is a singular and the second is a categorical.

<text>An all-star team is a group of people all having a high level of performance in their field. Originating in sports, it has since drifted into vernacular and has been borrowed heavily by the entertainment industry.

==Sports==
&quot;All-star&quot; as a sports term refers to individual players named to an &quot;all-star&quot; roster or team representing the top performers (members of such a team were &quot;all s&quot; from other teams) during and before the end of a season in a given sport, or to a list of top participants who played in individual sports such as golf and bowling. Events limited to such honorees are referred to as &quot;all-star games&quot; or events.

In American team sports the premier all-star games are the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, NBA All-Star Game (basketball), Pro Bowl (football), NHL All-Star Game (hockey), and MLS All-Star Game (soccer). Many all-star teams, such as collegiate &quot;all-conference&quot; and All-America squads, are recognitions of performance only, without the connotation of those selected ever being teammates in a game. The closest college sports come to an &quot;All-star&quot; game is the annual Senior Bowl which pits the best senior College Football players in the country against one another. These players generally go on to be drafted in the NFL Draft in April.

In gaelic games, the term &quot;all-stars&quot; refers to the GAA GPA All Stars Awards. These awards involve picking a fantasy team consisting of the top players in each position in the various sports (Gaelic football, Ladies&#x27; Gaelic football, hurling, rounders and camogie).

==Entertainment==
===Cinema===
The term &quot;all star&quot; is also used in films, often used as a form of publicity gimmick to promote the cast of a movie in which a number of high-profile actors appear, sometimes merely in cameo roles. An archetype is the 1956 version of &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;.

===Television===
In a similar vein to sporting events, some reality television franchises (such as &quot;Dancing with the Stars,&quot; &quot;Survivor&quot; ,&quot;&quot; and &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;)&quot;&quot; have held all star seasons featuring notable contestants from previous seasons, such as champions, contestants popular among viewers, and notable contestants from international versions of the franchise. These can include entire seasons where the alumni compete against each other, or a spin-off competition with a different format. One such example—&quot;&quot;— celebrate the 40th season and 20th Anniversary of the U.S. version, and featured 20 winners from past seasons competing for an increased cash prize of $2,000,000. Most of its challenges were also reprised from the seasons that the cast members had originally competed in.&quot;&quot;

Sometimes, all-star crossovers may be organized between contestants of multiple reality formats; the MTV series &quot;The Challenge&quot; was originally a competition spin-off of its reality shows &quot;The Real World&quot; and &quot;Road Rules&quot;, but later seasons began to increasingly include alumni from other popular reality series such as &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;, &quot;Big Brother&quot;, &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;, and &quot;Survivor&quot;.

=== Music ===
&quot;All-stars&quot; in music terms is referred to record labels or a music genre&#x27;s top musical artists. An example of this includes the single &quot;Pow 2011&quot; by Lethal Bizzle in which all the featured artists are credited as &quot;Grime All-Stars&quot;. Sometimes, labels organize such all-star sessions to release dedicated albums. Examples of this case are the collective This Mortal Coil under the 4AD label, or the Roadrunner United sessions by Roadrunner Records. The term is not equivalent to supergroup, which refers to a group made of already established musicians from other popular bands or with a successful solo career.

===Comics===

The All Star DC Comics was an imprint of ongoing American comic book titles published by DC Comics that ran from 2005 to 2008. DC has published two titles under the All-Star banner, featuring Batman and Superman. The premise of the imprint was to partner DC Comics&#x27; top tier characters with the most popular and acclaimed writers and artists.

<doc id="735123" wikidata="Q579" url="?curid=735123" title="Carlos Ibáñez del Campo">
<text>General Carlos Ibáñez del Campo (; 3 November 1877 – 28 April 1960) was a Chilean Army officer and political figure. He served as president twice, first between 1927 and 1931, and then from 1952 to 1958, serving for 10 years in office.

== The coups of 1924 and 1925 ==
The presidency of Arturo Alessandri saw a rise in popular discontent over an inefficient government. In 1924, the Chilean armed forces, led by General Luis Altamirano, began the &quot;saber-rattling&quot; (&quot;ruido de sables&quot;), a protest where soldiers banged their sabers against the floor of the Congress. Amid threats from the armed forces, Alessandri decided he could no longer govern and submitted his resignation. Although this resignation was not approved by Congress, Alessandri left the country and Altamirano established a military junta.

However, another faction of the armed forces, led by Colonel Marmaduke Grove and Lieutenant Colonel Ibáñez, decided the junta&#x27;s reforms did not go far enough in ending the government&#x27;s inefficiency. They led another coup, deposed Altamirano, and established a new junta with Emilio Bello Codesido as head. Ibáñez and Grove, the powers behind the scene, agreed to ask Alessandri to return and complete his term.

== Minister of War and Home Affairs==
Alessandri returned in 1925 and drafted a new constitution which was designed to decrease the powers of the legislature, thereby making government more effective. Ibáñez was named Minister of War and later Home Affairs Minister. However, Alessandri decided Ibáñez was becoming too ambitious, and many ridiculed Alessandri as a pawn of Ibáñez. In response, Alessandri resigned once more and went into exile. Ibáñez announced his candidacy in the upcoming presidential elections, but the three main Chilean political parties (Conservative, Liberal, Radical) pressured him to desist. The three parties then presented a consensus choice, Emiliano Figueroa Larraín, to be the sole presidential candidate, in order to avoid political campaigning in the volatile political atmosphere.
Nevertheless, Ibáñez&#x27;s closest adviser, leftist José Santos Salas, later declared his presidential candidacy, and many suspected it was with Ibáñez&#x27;s backing.

Figueroa triumphed with 71% of the vote, but kept Ibáñez as home affairs minister. Ibáñez was able to control the weak Figueroa who decided to resign in 1927 rather than be Ibáñez&#x27;s puppet. Because he was home affairs minister, under the Chilean constitution, Ibáñez became vice president and announced elections for 22 May that year. In the presidential elections, the traditional political parties decided not to participate. Ibáñez&#x27;s only opponent was the communist Elías Lafertte, who was exiled in the Juan Fernández Archipelago throughout the electoral campaign. Ibáñez won the election with 98% of the vote.

== First presidency ==
Ibáñez began to exercise dictatorial powers, using rule by decree (&quot;decretos con fuerza de ley&quot;), suspending parliamentary elections, instead naming politicians to the Senate and Chamber of Deputies himself, etc. Political opponents were arrested and exiled, including his former ally Marmaduke Grove. His popularity, however, was helped by massive loans by American banks, which helped to promote a high rate of growth in the country. He constructed massive public works, and increased public spending. He also created the Carabineros de Chile (police force) by unifying the previously disorganized police forces. Another significant achievement of Ibáñez&#x27;s first administration was the signing of the 1929 Treaty of Lima, in which Chile agreed to return the Tacna Province to Peru, which had been seized during the War of the Pacific.

His popularity lasted until after the Wall Street crash of 1929. At that point all loans were halted and called. Without the influx of foreign currency, Chile was heavily affected by the Great Depression. Ibáñez&#x27;s large public spending did nothing to alleviate the situation, and his opponents, primarily the exiled Grove and Alessandri, began to plan a comeback. After a great wave of public unrest, Ibáñez left the country for exile, on 26 July 1931, after delegating his office to the president of the senate, Pedro Opazo, who in turn resigned in favor of the interior minister, Juan Esteban Montero.

== Between presidencies ==
Chile did not reach political stability until the 1932 reelection of Arturo Alessandri, whose economic policies managed to alleviate the depression. He ran for president again in the 1942 election, but lost to Juan Antonio Rios.

== Return to the Presidency ==
In the 1952 presidential elections, the right-wing Agrarian Labor Party (&quot;Partido Agrario Laborista&quot;) declared Ibáñez a presidential candidate. Ibáñez also garnered the support of the left-wing Popular Socialist Party and some feminist political unions – the feminist María de la Cruz was his campaign manager, but she then refused a ministerial office. Ibáñez promised to &quot;sweep&quot; out political corruption and bad government with his &quot;broom&quot; and was nicknamed the &quot;General of Hope&quot;. He criticized traditional political parties but was vague in his proposals and had no clear position in the political spectrum. He won the election with 47%.

The Bolivian National Revolution of 1952 influenced the followers of Ibáñez who saw it as a model of the national-populism they sought to implement in Chile.

His second term was a very modest success. By that time he was already old and ailing, and he left government mostly to his cabinet. His major problems during his presidency were those concerned with the economy. He had no plan to control inflation – one of the most pressing economic problems at the time in Chile – and as a result it skyrocketed to 71% in 1954 and 83% in 1955. Helped by the Klein-Sacks mission, Ibáñez managed to reduce it to 33% when he left the presidency. During his term, public transport costs rose by 50% and economic growth fell to 2.5%.

Now much more of a centrist politically, Ibáñez won the support of many left-wingers by repealing the &quot;Law for the Defense of Democracy&quot;, which banned the Communist Party. He did also take a softer approach on crime than in his first presidency. For example, he commuted the death sentence for The Jackal of Pupunahue to life imprisonment.

Some Chileans continued to support an Ibáñez dictatorship. These &quot;ibañistas&quot;, most of whom were retired army officers, created the &quot;Línea Recta&quot; (Straight Line) group to establish a new dictatorship. Ibáñez met with these conspirators, but ultimately his typical lack of trust ended the plans for a self-coup. A scandal rocked the Ibáñez administration when the press revealed Ibáñez&#x27;s meetings with these conspirators.

== Retirement and legacy ==
Ibáñez was succeeded by Jorge Alessandri Rodriguez, the son of his archenemy Arturo Alessandri. He abandoned politics and died in Santiago in 1960. As a result of Ibañez&#x27;s nebulous and vacillating political ideology, he left no intellectual legacy to Chilean politics. His long and often poorly defined presence of more than thirty years on the Chilean political scene (during which he often appeared to have little actual sympathy with the political goals of the groups that supported him at various times, e.g. he was too moderate to agree with the &quot;nacistas&quot; and too respectful of existing institutions to emulate Peronism successfully) produced its most significant results in the early years of his caretaker presidency in the 1920s through his efforts to develop new towns in the regions to the south of the Central Valley and to improve existing infrastructure in the South.

The Región Aysén del General Carlos Ibáñez del Campo is named after him, in honor of his attempts to integrate the isolated regions of Aysén and Magallanes into Chile. The General Ibáñez Airport in Punta Arenas is also named after him.

<doc id="735136" wikidata="Q470914" url="?curid=735136" title="Ibn Zuhr">
<text>Abū Marwān ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Zuhr (), traditionally known by his Latinized name Avenzoar (; 1094–1162), was an Arab physician, surgeon, and poet. He was born at Seville in medieval Andalusia (present-day Spain), was a contemporary of Averroes and Ibn Tufail, and was the most well-regarded physician of his era. He was particularly known for his emphasis on a more rational, empiric basis of medicine. His major work, &quot;Al-Taysīr fil-Mudāwāt wal-Tadbīr&quot; (&quot;Book of Simplification Concerning Therapeutics and Diet&quot;), was translated into Latin and Hebrew and was influential to the progress of surgery. He also improved surgical and medical knowledge by keying out several diseases and their treatments.

Ibn Zuhr performed the first experimental tracheotomy on a goat. He is thought to have made the earliest description of bezoar stones as medicinal items.

==Biography==
Avenzoar was born in Seville in 1094, to the notable Banu Zuhr family who were members of the Arab tribe of Iyad. Starting in the early 10th century, the family produced six consecutive generations of physicians, as well as jurists, poets, viziers or courtiers, and midwives who served under the rulers of al-Andalus. Avenzoar started his education by studying religion and literature, as was the custom in medieval Muslim socialites. He later studied medicine with his father, Abu&#x27;l-Ala Zuhr (d.1131) at an early age. According to Avenzoar himself, his father introduced him to the works of Galen and Hippocrates, and asked him to swear the Hippocratic Oath while still a youth.

Avenzoar started his medical career as court physician for the Almoravid empire. However, for some undisclosed reason, he later fell out of favour with the Almoravid ruler, &#x27;Ali bin Yusuf bin Tashufin, and fled from Seville. He was however, apprehended and jailed in Marrakesh in 1140. This experience left a bad resentment in him as alluded from his writing. Later in 1147 when the Almohad empire conquered Seville, he returned and devoted himself to medical practice. He died in Seville in 1162.

According to Leo Africanus, ibn Zuhr heard Averroes lecture, and learned physics from him. He was a great admirer of Galen, and in his writings he protests emphatically against quackery and the superstitious remedies of astrologers.

==Works==
===Kitab al-Iqtisad===
&quot;The book of moderation,&quot; this was a treatise on general therapy written in his youth for the Almoravid prince Ibrahim Yusuf ibn Tashfin. The book is a summary of various different diseases, therapeutics and general hygiene. It is also noted for its advice regarding cosmetics and physical beauty. Ibn Zuhr even recommended plastic surgery to alter acquired features such as big noses, thick lips or crooked teeth.

===Kitab al-Aghdhiya===
The book of foods, as its name indicates, is a manual on foods and regimen which contains guidelines for a healthy life. Ibn Zuhr wrote the book shortly after he went out of jail for his new patron, Almohad leader Abd al-Mu&#x27;min. The book contains classification of different kinds of dishes and foods like bread, meat, beverages, fruits and sweets. When he talks about the meat, Ibn Zuhr mentions different kinds of animals&#x27; fleshes, even unusual ones like those of gazelles, lions and snakes, classifying them based on their taste, usefulness and digestibility. He also recommends specific foods for each season of the year. For example, during winter, digestion is accelerated, so the amount of food consumed should also be increased. Moreover, the food should also be warmer and drier, as temperatures are lower and humidity is higher.

===Kitab al-Taysir===
Kitab al-Taysir seems to be the last book of Ibn Zuhr before his death. As mentioned in the introduction, the book was authored at the request of his friend, Averroes, to act as a compendium to his medical encyclopedia Colliget which focused more on general topics of medicine. The two books were later translated into Hebrew and Latin, where they used to be printed as a single book and remained popular as late as the 18th century.

The book, which contains 30 chapters, provides clinical descriptions and diagnosis of diseases starting from the head. Ibn Zuhr provided an accurate description of the esophageal, stomach and mediastinal cancers, as well as other lesions. He proposed feeding enemas to keep alive patients with stomach cancer. He was also the first to give pathological descriptions of inflammations like otitis media and pericarditis.

Perhaps Ibn Zuhr&#x27;s greatest contribution to medicine was his application of experimental method by introducing animal testing. He is known to have performed medical procedures on animals before doing them on humans to know if they would work. Most notable was his approval and recommendation for the surgical procedure of tracheotomy, which was a controversial procedure at the time. In trying to sort out the controversy, Ibn Zuhr described the following medical experiment which he performed on a goat:
&quot;Earlier on in my training when I read those opinions (controversies), I cut on the lung pipe of a goat after incising the skin and the covering sheath underneath. Then I completely cut off the substance of the pipe, an area just less than the size of a tirmisah (lupine seed). Then, I kept washing the wound with water and honey till it healed and it (the animal) totally recovered and lived for a long time.&quot;

===Other works===
Ibn Abi Usaibia mentions these other works of Ibn Zuhr:
* Fi al-Zinah (On Beatification).
* Al-Tiryaq al-Sabini (On Antidotes).
* Fi Illat al-Kila (On Diseases of the Kidney).
* Fi Illat al-Baras wa al-Bahaq (On Leprosy and Vitiligo).
* Al-Tadhkirah (The Remembrance).

==Legacy==
The Jewish physician-philosopher Maimonides admired Ibn Zuhr, describing him as &quot;unique in his age and one of the great sages&quot;. He frequently quoted him in his medical texts. Averroes praised him as the greatest physician since Galen. Both his daughter and granddaughter also became physicians, specializing in obstetrics.

<doc id="735142" wikidata="Q601491" url="?curid=735142" title="Mohamed Amin Didi">
<text>Sumuvvul Ameer Mohamed Amin Dhoshimeynaa Kilegefaanu (; July 20, 1910 – January 19, 1954), popularly known as Mohamed Amin Didi, was a Maldivian politician who served as the first president of the Maldives and as the head of government between January 1, 1953, and August 21, 1953. Amin Didi was also the principal of Majeedhiyya School from 1946 to 1953.

Amin Didi was the leader of the first political party in the Maldives, Rayyithunge Muthagaddim Party. His political program included efforts to modernize the country, including the advancement of women, education in the Maldives, nationalising the fish export industry and an unpopular ban on tobacco smoking.

Amin Didi took office during post World War II period, a time when the country was in widespread famine and exhausted resources.

==Early life==
Amin was the son of Athireegey Ahmed Dhoshimeynaa kilegefaan and Roanugey Aishath Didi. He was a descendant of the Huraa Dynasty, from his father&#x27;s side. In 1920, he went abroad to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and studied in Saint Joseph&#x27;s College, Colombo. In 1928, he went to India for further studies in Aligarh Muslim University, returning to the Maldives one year later. His wife was Fathimath Saeed, and his only child was Annabeela Ameena Mohamed Amin

== Premiership ==
He was appointed as the Prime Minister on 1 January 1947 and left on 2 September 1953. During his time as Prime Minister, he wrote a promotional booklet titled ‘Ladies and Gentlemen: The Maldive Islands’, which provided foreigners information about the life, culture and economy about the Maldives.

==Politics==
In 1931, Amin was appointed to the Constituent Assembly convened by Sultan Muhammad Shamsuddeen III to draft the country&#x27;s first written constitution. He subsequently held various posts in the government, such as the Chief Officer of Customs, head of the Maldivian Post Office, and Minister of Trade, Minister of Finance (1942–1952), Mahkamat Al-Kharijiyya (Ministry of Foreign Affairs; 1944-1953), and was also a member of the First Maldivian Parliament.

== Revolution ==
In a report by &quot;Mihaaru&quot;, it was revealed that Ibrahim Zaki, Mohamed Zaki and Ibrahim Nasir was the one staging the revolution and invited VP Ibrahim Muhammad Didi who then agreed to joined. Ibrahim Didi joined due to his distaste of Amin&#x27;s handling of state funds. On the day of the revolution, he locked the door of the wireless office, announced the people they wanted to arrest, all of them being close associates of Amin. A special assembly was called and a no confidence vote was brought up against Amin Didi, which temporarily handed all powers to Ibrahim Didi. Amin, in Sri Lanka receiving medical treatment at the time didn&#x27;t know what happened until he received a letter from Ibrahim Didi informing him about what happened but didn&#x27;t tell him about his removal of power and Amin arrived by flight to RAF Gan and headed to Malé where Ibrahim Didi and Faamludheyri Kilegefaanu took him to Dhoonidhoo where he ordered the Army to beat Amin. He later was taken to Vihamanaafushi where he died from health complications.

== Investigation on Amin&#x27;s death ==
The Office of Ombudsperson for Transitional Justice accepted a case lodged with the office seeking justice for the death of Mohamed Amin Didi, which was submitted by the then Central Maafannu MP, Ibrahim Rasheed, in September 2021. 

Rasheed said the case involves loss of fundamental human rights due to systemic abuse by state institutions. He said it needs to be made clearer how the state treated Amin. He has also requested to overturn Amin&#x27;s conviction as a traitor. 

Ameen served as President of Maldives for eight months – between January 1953 and August 1953. He was removed from power and banished to Vihamanaafushi Island – now Kurumba Island Resort – where he died in January 1954. 

The Office of Ombudsperson for Transitional Justice was mandated with identifying and investigating systemic human rights violations by state institutions. However, the office has since expired in 19 November 2023 and faced multiple allegations of investigations not being investigated properly.

==Family==
Amin Didi had one daughter, Annabeela Ameena Mohamed Amin. His grandson Ameen Faisal was the Minister of Defence and National Security of Maldives. His other grandchildren are Ibrahim Faisal, Farahanaz Faisal and Aishath Shuweykar. His mother&#x27;s name was Aishath Didi his father&#x27;s name was Ahmed Dhoshimeynaa Kileygefaanu.

<text>A statistical syllogism (or proportional syllogism or direct inference) is a non-deductive syllogism. It argues, using inductive reasoning, from a generalization true for the most part to a particular case.

==Introduction==

Statistical syllogisms may use qualifying words like &quot;most&quot;, &quot;frequently&quot;, &quot;almost never&quot;, &quot;rarely&quot;, etc., or may have a statistical generalization as one or both of their premises.

&quot;For example:&quot;

#Almost all people are taller than 26 inches
#Gareth is a person
#Therefore, Gareth is taller than 26 inches

Premise 1 (the major premise) is a generalization, and the argument attempts to draw a conclusion from that generalization. In contrast to a deductive syllogism, the premises logically support or confirm the conclusion rather than strictly implying it: it is possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false, but it is not likely.

&quot;General form:&quot;

#X proportion of F are G
#I is an F
#I is a G

In the abstract form above, F is called the &quot;reference class&quot; and G is the &quot;attribute class&quot; and I is the individual object. So, in the earlier example, &quot;(things that are) taller than 26 inches&quot; is the attribute class and &quot;people&quot; is the reference class.

Unlike many other forms of syllogism, a statistical syllogism is inductive, so when evaluating this kind of argument it is important to consider how strong or weak it is, along with the other rules of induction (as opposed to deduction). In the above example, if 99% of people are taller than 26 inches, then the probability of the conclusion being true is 99%.

Two &quot;dicto simpliciter&quot; fallacies can occur in statistical syllogisms. They are &quot;accident&quot; and &quot;converse accident&quot;. Faulty generalization fallacies can also affect any argument premise that uses a generalization. A problem with applying the statistical syllogism in real cases is the reference class problem: given that a particular case I is a member of very many reference classes F, in which the proportion of attribute G may differ widely, how should one decide which class to use in applying the statistical syllogism?

The importance of the statistical syllogism was urged by Henry E. Kyburg, Jr., who argued that all statements of probability could be traced to a direct inference. For example, when taking off in an airplane, our confidence (but not certainty) that we will land safely is based on our knowledge that the vast majority of flights do land safely. 
The widespread use of confidence intervals in statistics is often justified using a statistical syllogism, in such words as &quot;Were this procedure to be repeated on multiple samples, the calculated confidence interval (which would differ for each sample) would encompass the true population parameter 90% of the time.&quot; The inference from what would mostly happen in multiple samples to the confidence we should have in the particular sample involves a statistical syllogism. One person who argues that statistical syllogism is more of a probability is Donald Williams.

==History==
Ancient writers on logic and rhetoric approved arguments from &quot;what happens for the most part&quot;. For example, Aristotle writes &quot;that which people know to happen or not to happen, or to be or not to be, mostly in a particular way, is likely, for example, that the envious are malevolent or that those who are loved are affectionate.&quot;

The ancient Jewish law of the Talmud used a &quot;follow the majority&quot; rule to resolve cases of doubt. 

From the invention of insurance in the 14th century, insurance rates were based on estimates (often intuitive) of the frequencies of the events insured against, which involves an implicit use of a statistical syllogism. John Venn pointed out in 1876 that this leads to a reference class problem of deciding in what class containing the individual case to take frequencies in. He writes, “It is obvious that every single thing or event has an indefinite number of properties or attributes observable in it, and might therefore be considered as belonging to an indefinite number of different classes of things”, leading to problems with how to assign probabilities to a single case, for example the probability that John Smith, a consumptive Englishman aged fifty, will live to sixty-one.

In the 20th century, clinical trials were designed to find the proportion of cases of disease cured by a drug, in order that the drug can be applied confidently to an individual patient with the disease.

==Problem of induction==

The statistical syllogism was used by Donald Cary Williams and David Stove in their attempt to give a logical solution to the problem of induction. They put forward the argument, which has the form of a statistical syllogism:

#The great majority of large samples of a population approximately match the population (in proportion)
#This is a large sample from a population
#Therefore, this sample approximately matches the population

If the population is, say, a large number of balls which are black or white but in an unknown proportion, and one takes a large sample and finds they are all white, then it is likely, using this statistical syllogism, that the population is all or nearly all white. That is an example of inductive reasoning.

==Legal examples==
Statistical syllogisms may be used as legal evidence but it is usually believed that a legal decision should not be based solely on them. For example, in L. Jonathan Cohen&#x27;s &quot;gatecrasher paradox&quot;, 499 tickets to a rodeo have been sold and 1000 people are observed in the stands. The rodeo operator sues a random attendee for non-payment of the entrance fee. The statistical syllogism:

#501 of the 1000 attendees have not paid
#The defendant is an attendee
#Therefore, on the balance of probabilities the defendant has not paid

is a strong one, but it is felt to be unjust to burden a defendant with membership of a class, without evidence that bears directly on the defendant.

<text>The Cinque Terre (; ; meaning &#x27;Five Lands&#x27;) are a coastal area within Liguria, in the northwest of Italy. It lies in the west of La Spezia Province, and comprises five villages: Monterosso al Mare, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore. The coastline, the five villages, and the surrounding hillsides are all part of the Cinque Terre National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Vernazza is one of I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;).

The Cinque Terre area is a popular tourist destination. Over the centuries, people have built terraces on the rugged, steep landscape right up to the cliffs that overlook the Ligurian Sea. Paths, trains, and boats connect the villages as cars can only reach them with great difficulty from the outside via narrow and precarious mountain roads.

==History==
Cinque Terre is mentioned in documents dating to the 11th century. Monterosso and Vernazza were settled first and the other villages grew later, whilst within the territory of the Republic of Genoa. In the 16th century, the inhabitants reinforced existing forts and built new defensive towers to protect the population from attacks by the Turks. Cinque Terre experienced an economic decline from the 17th to 19th centuries, recovering when an arsenal was built in La Spezia and it gained a railway link to Genoa.

Bombing and fighting during World War II caused extensive damage to the Cinque Terre.

The railway led to migration from the area and a decline in traditional industries until the growth of tourism from the 1970s onward brought some prosperity.

The predominant crops in the area have been grapes and olives. Some fishermen were based in Monterosso, but the area&#x27;s gaily painted fishermen&#x27;s cottages were conceived in the late 1970s as a tourist attraction.

Because of its exceptional cultural and ecological assets, UNESCO added Cinque Terre to its list of World Heritage Sites in 1997.

On 25 October 2011, torrential rain caused floods and mudslides in Cinque Terre. Nine people were killed and villages were severely damaged, particularly Vernazza and Monterosso al Mare. 
The heavy rainfall event was favoured by the crisis of the traditional and less remunerative cultivation of terraced landscapes which sixty years before started a progressive decline and reduction of maintenance. It was partially balanced by the vegetation that spontaneously developed on abandoned terraces, a role underlined by a part of the existing scientific literature.

==Transport and tourism==

Access to Cinque Terre by car is possible, but parking is a major issue. The best method of transportation is by train. Trains run from La Spezia to all five towns within the Cinque Terre, as well as to major regional and national destinations. The Cinque Terre railway stations are located on the Genoa-Pisa line. Most long-distance trains do not stop at all five Cinque Terre towns, making it necessary to transfer from La Spezia onto regional trains or the Cinque Terre Express. Some intercity trains also stop at Monterosso Station.

A scheduled passenger ferry runs between Levanto and La Spezia, stopping at all of the main villages except Corniglia, which does not have a landing point, as it is not located on the coast. Boats also connect to Genoa&#x27;s Old Harbour, Lerici, and Porto Venere.

== Paths ==
Many walking trails run throughout the park and are named according to the SVA numbering system, however, it is common to hear trails referred to by their previous numbers, causing confusion to visitors.

The most popular path is known as the (&quot;Blue Trail&quot;), used to connect the five villages. Due to the unstable environment, landslides frequently cause portions of the trails to be closed. The &quot;Sentiero Azzurro&quot; section from Riomaggiore to Manarola called the (&quot;Love Walk&quot;) has been closed since fall 2019 and is expected to reopen in 2024. It is still possible to walk between these villages, although the trail is both steeper and longer than the closed path along the waterfront.

==Culture==
=== Literature ===

From the poem, &quot;The Lemon Trees&quot;, 1921. This is how the Nobel laureate Eugenio Montale, through his poetry, describes Monterosso and how the Cinque Terre must be discovered.

The &quot;Cinque Terre&quot; were not only a source of inspiration for Eugenio Montale but for many others.
* Dante Alighieri compared the Cinque Terre with the rugged cliff of Purgatory in the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;:

* Boccaccio in the second novel of the tenth day in &quot;The Decameron&quot;: 

* Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio in his work &quot;Faville del Maglio&quot; cites the DOC white wine &#x27;Sciachetrà&#x27;:
=== Cinema ===
In 2013 Cinque Terre was one of the shooting locations of the movie &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot; by Martin Scorsese.

The 2021 Disney/Pixar film &quot;Luca&quot; was set in the fictional town of Portorosso, on the Italian Riviera, placed west of Corniglia on a fictional map. Portorosso was inspired by and modeled after Cinque Terre.

=== Videogames ===
The 2016 videogame &quot;Hitman&quot; featured the fictional town of Sapienza, which was inspired by Vernazza and other towns on the Ligurian shoreline.

==Food and wine==

Given its location on the Mediterranean, seafood is plentiful in the local cuisine. Anchovies of Monterosso are a local speciality designated with a Protected Designation of Origin status from the European Union. The mountainsides of the Cinque Terre are heavily terraced and are used to cultivate grapes and olives. This area, and the region of Liguria, as a whole, is known for pesto, a sauce made from basil leaves, garlic, salt, olive oil, pine nuts, and pecorino cheese. Focaccia is a particularly common locally baked bread product. Farinata, a typical snack found in bakeries and pizzerias, is a savoury and crunchy pancake made from a base of chick pea flour. The town of Corniglia is particularly popular for a gelato made from local honey ().

The grapes of the Cinque Terre are used to produce two locally made wines. The eponymous &quot;Cinque Terre&quot; and the &quot;Sciachetrà&quot; are both made using Bosco, Albarola, and Vermentino grapes. Both wines are produced by the , located between Manarola and Volastra. Other DOC producers are Forlini-Capellini, Walter de Batté, Buranco, Arrigoni.

In addition to wines, other popular local drinks include grappa, a brandy made with the pomace left from winemaking, and limoncino, a sweet, creamy liqueur made from lemons. It is served chilled after meals and often used in the preparation of desserts.

==Preservation==
In 1998, the Italian Ministry for the Environment set up the Cinque Terre protected natural marine area to protect the natural environment and to promote socio-economic development compatible with the natural landscape of the area. Today, millions of visitors visit it every year. In 1999 the Parco Nazionale delle Cinque Terre was created to conserve the ecological balance, protect the landscape, and safeguard the anthropological values of the location. Nevertheless, dwindling interest in cultivation and maintenance of the terrace walls posed a long-term threat to the site, which was for this reason included in the 2000 and 2002 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund. The organization secured grants from American Express to support a study of the conservation of Cinque Terre. Following the study, a site management plan was created.

<doc id="735148" wikidata="Q56546" url="?curid=735148" title="Huizhou Chinese">
<text>Huizhou (), or the Hui dialect (), is a group of Sinitic languages spoken in and around the historical region of Huizhou (for which it is named), in about ten or so mountainous counties in southern Anhui, plus a few more in neighbouring Zhejiang and Jiangxi.

Although the Hui area is small compared with other Chinese dialect groups, it displays a very high degree of internal variation, and the lect is also situated near many mutually unintelligible varieties, making its classification difficult. It has been previously grouped with Huai, Wu, and Gan, and some even believe that it does not even constitute a singular language family.

== Classification ==
Huizhou Chinese was originally classified as Lower Yangtze Mandarin but it is currently classified separately from it.
The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences supported the separation of Huizhou from Lower Yangtze Mandarin in 1987. Its classification is disputed, with some linguists, such as Matisoff classifying it as Wu Chinese, others such as Bradley (2007) as Gan, and still others setting it apart as a primary branch of Chinese.

A reconstruction of Common Huizhou by Coblin has found that the lect group is likely areal, not a &quot;genetically related&quot; group of varieties, and is merely a useful category to collect these hard-to-classify varieties. He notes that they do not belong to any other top-level group due to the lack of shared innovations with any, and that they do not have any shared innovations among themselves. He also notes that the above conclusion would imply that his reconstruction is not a proto-system, but instead an &quot;analytical device or template&quot;.

==History==
During the Ming and Qing dynasties, Jianghuai speakers moved into Hui dialect areas.

Some works of literature produced in Yangzhou, such as &quot;Qingfengzha&quot;, a novel, contain Jianghuai Mandarin. People in Yangzhou identified by the dialect they speak, locals spoke the dialect, as opposed to sojourners, who spoke other varieties like Huizhou or Wu. This led to the formation of identity based on one&#x27;s dialect. Large numbers of merchants from Huizhou lived in Yangzhou and effectively were responsible for keeping the town afloat. Merchants in the later imperial period also sponsored operas and performances in the Hui dialect.

==Languages and dialects==
Zhengzhang Shangfang divided the Hui languages into five subgroups, which are also used in the &quot;Language Atlas of China&quot;:

;Ji–She (績歙)
:spoken in Jixi, She County, Huizhou, Jingde (Hongchuan area in the west), and Ningguo (Hongmen area in the south), Anhui province, as well as Chun&#x27;an (Tangcun in the west, etc.), Zhejiang province.
:carries notable Wu influence. Jixihua is the main Ji-She variety.
;Xiu–Yi (休黟)
:spoken in Tunxi, Taiping (Guocun in the southwest), Xiuning, Yi County, and Qimen (around Fufeng in the southeast), as well as Wuyuan, Jiangxi province.
:Tunxihua is the main Xiu-Yi variety.
;Qi–De (祁德)
:spoken in Qimen and Dongzhi (partially), Anhui province, as well as Fuliang, Dexing, and Wuyuan, Jiangxi province.
:greatly influenced by the surrounding Gan languages. 
;Yanzhou (嚴州)
:spoken in Chun&#x27;an and Jiande (formerly Yanzhou Prefecture), Zhejiang province.
:heavily influenced by Wu.
;Jing–Zhan (旌占)
:spoken in Jingde, Qimen (in and around Anling, Chengan, and Chiling), Shitai (Zhanda area), Yi County (Meixi, Kecun, and other northern towns), and Ningguo, Anhui province.
:forms a thin corridor along the northern edge of the Hui group, carrying influence from Xuanzhou Wu.

Huizhou varieties differ from township to township. People in different townships, towns, etc. (even in one county) often cannot speak with one another.

==Features==

Phonologically speaking, Hui is noted for its massive loss of syllable codas, including -i, -u, and nasals:

Many Hui dialects have diphthongs with a higher lengthened first part. For example, (&quot;speech&quot;) is in Xiuning County (Standard Chinese ), (&quot;yard&quot;) is in Xiuning County (Standard Chinese ); (&quot;knot&quot;) is in Yi County (Standard Chinese ), (&quot;agreement&quot;) is in Yi County (Standard Chinese ). A few areas take this to extremes. For example, Likou in Qimen County has for (&quot;rice&quot;) (Standard Chinese ), with the appearing directly as a result of the lengthened, nasalized .

Because nasal codas have mostly been lost, Hui reuses the ending as a diminutive. For example, in the Tunxi dialect, &quot;rope&quot; appears as from + .

<doc id="735151" wikidata="Q380107" url="?curid=735151" title="Rick Warren">
<text>Richard Duane Warren (born January 28, 1954) is an American evangelical Christian pastor and author. He is the founder of Saddleback Church, an evangelical Baptist megachurch in Lake Forest, California. Since 2022, he serves as executive director of the Finishing the Task mission coalition.

==Early life and education==
Warren was born in San Jose, California, the son of Jimmy and Dot Warren. His father was a Baptist minister, his mother a high-school librarian. He was raised in Ukiah, California, and graduated from Ukiah High School in 1972, where he founded the first Christian club on the school&#x27;s campus.

He studied at California Baptist University in Riverside, California and earned a Bachelor of Arts, then he studied at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas and earned a Master of Divinity in 1979. He also studied at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California and earned a Doctor of Ministry.

==Ministry==
Warren says he was called to full-time ministry when he was a 19-year-old student at California Baptist University. In November 1973, he and a friend skipped classes and drove 350 miles to hear W. A. Criswell preach at the Jack Tar Hotel in San Francisco. Warren waited afterwards to shake hands with Criswell, who focused on Warren, stating, &quot;I feel led to lay hands on you and pray for you!&quot;

During his time at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Warren worked at the Texas Ranch for Christ, a ministry facility of Billie Hanks Jr., where he began writing books. He co-wrote two books, &quot;The Victory Scripture Memory Series&quot; and &quot;Twelve Dynamic Bible Study Methods for Laity&quot;, with Hanks and Wayne Watts.

In January 1980, Warren began a Bible study group with seven people and his wife at their Saddleback Valley condo in Orange County, California. In April 1980, Warren held Saddleback Church&#x27;s first public service on Easter Sunday at the Laguna Hills High School Theater with 200 people in attendance. Warren&#x27;s church growth methods led to rapid expansion, with the church using nearly 80 different facilities in its 35-year history. The church averages nearly 20,000 people in attendance each week.

In 2005, during the Centenary Congress of the Baptist World Alliance, he affirmed that the withdrawal of the Southern Baptist Convention from the Alliance was a mistake since theological differences should not prevent fellowship with other churches.

Warren has been invited to speak at national and international forums, including the United Nations, the World Economic Forum in Davos, the African Union, the Council on Foreign Relations, Harvard Kennedy School, TED, and Time&#x27;s Global Health Summit. He has been a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) since 2005.

In August 2008, Warren drew greater national attention by hosting the Civil Forum on the Presidency, featuring senators John McCain and Barack Obama at Saddleback Church. The forum marked McCain and Obama&#x27;s first joint appearance as the presumptive Republican and Democratic presidential nominees and was broadcast live on national television.

In December 2008, President-elect Obama chose Warren to give the invocation at his inauguration ceremony. The decision angered pro-choice and LGBT advocates and led to criticism of both Obama and Warren. Obama defended his choice of Warren, saying that although he disagreed with the minister&#x27;s positions on abortion and same-sex marriage, there should be room for dialogue on such difficult social issues. More controversy ensued when it was announced that Warren would be the keynote speaker at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Annual Commemorative Service on January 19, 2009, the day prior to the inauguration. He delivered the invocation at Obama&#x27;s inauguration the next day, which was generally praised for its positive message.

In January 2009, Warren and the Reader&#x27;s Digest Association partnered in the launch of the &quot;Purpose Driven Connection&quot;, a quarterly publication sold as part of a bundle of multimedia products. In November 2009, the partners announced that the magazine had not drawn enough paying members and would cease after publication of the fourth issue that month.

In 2010, Warren was chosen to lead a prayer at the inauguration ceremony of the President of Rwanda, Paul Kagame. Since that date, he has been part of the latter&#x27;s Presidential Advisory Council.

In June 2021, Warren announced he would be retiring from the senior pastor position at Saddleback, but that he would stay on until his successor is appointed. In January 2022, he became executive director of Finishing the Task, a mission coalition. In August of that year, Warren stepped down as lead pastor while maintaining a founding pastor role.

In May 2023, Warren was installed as the first honorary chancellor of Spurgeon&#x27;s College. The following month, during the annual Southern Baptist Convention, after Saddleback Church was excommunicated from the Convention for hiring a female pastor, he championed the ordination of women.

===Purpose Driven===
Warren taught the material that would one day become the Purpose Driven philosophy of ministry to individual pastors who called or wrote him in Saddleback&#x27;s early days.

Warren gained experience teaching the material through his participation in the Institute for Evangelism and Church Growth, affiliated with Fuller Theological Seminary.

In 1995 Zondervan published Warren&#x27;s best-selling book, &quot;The Purpose Driven Church&quot;, which distilled many of the lessons he had learned while starting Saddleback Church and honed during years of training other pastors. After sharing the &quot;Saddleback Story&quot;, the book makes a case for building a church around five purposes (worship, fellowship, discipleship, ministry, and evangelism) through what Warren called a &quot;crowd to core&quot; method of church growth. He encouraged churches to reach their community, bring in a crowd, turn attendees into members, develop those members to maturity, turn them into ministers, and send them out on a mission.

In 2004, more than 10,000 churches of various denominations attended a seminar or a conference led by Warren.

===P.E.A.C.E. Plan===
In 2003, Saddleback Church, Kay and Rick Warren founded the P.E.A.C.E. Plan, a humanitarian development program for churches.

==Recognition==
In 2004, Warren was named one of the &quot;leaders who mattered most in 2004&quot; by &quot;Time&quot;. In April 2005, Warren was named by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the &quot;100 Most Influential People in the World&quot;. Warren was named one of &quot;America&#x27;s Top 25 Leaders&quot; in October 2005, by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. In 2006, Warren was named by &quot;Newsweek&quot; one of &quot;15 People Who Make America Great&quot;.

In 2006, &quot;The Purpose Driven Life&quot; sold more than 30 million copies, making Warren a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling author.

==Personal life==
Warren has been married to Kay Warren since June 21, 1975. They have three adult children and four grandchildren. He considers Billy Graham, Peter Drucker, and his own father to be among his mentors.

In 2006, after the success of his book &quot;The Purpose Driven Life&quot;, he claimed to have made the decision to &quot;reverse the tithe&quot;, donating 90% of his income to three foundations and no longer receive a salary from the church.

Warren&#x27;s youngest son, Matthew, died by suicide on April 6, 2013, after 10 years of struggling with mental illness since childhood. He says that, after the event, more than 10,000 people wrote to him about their own struggles within the church. In March 2014, Warren launched a ministry to educate Saddleback on its role to help people struggling with mental illness at &quot;The Gathering on Mental Health and the Church&quot;.

==Political and social views==

The combination of Warren&#x27;s tone on political issues central to U.S. evangelicals and his concern for social issues has resulted in the characterization of Warren as one of a &quot;new breed of evangelical leaders.&quot; Warren strongly denies this has been an indication of a shift in position on traditional evangelical issues, as some in the media have reported.

In a conversation with atheist author Sam Harris in &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine, Warren spoke out against evolution and in favor of creationism. He also said, when questioned on whether religion is beneficial to society, that brutal dictators such as Mao Zedong, Joseph Stalin, and Pol Pot were all atheists.

In a 2005 Larry King Live interview, during the Terri Schiavo controversy, Warren stated that withholding feeding to Schiavo, a woman in a persistent vegetative state, was &quot;not a right-to-die issue.&quot; He elaborated on his concerns over the decision to remove her feeding tube: &quot;I fear the day, that if we start saying, well, you don&#x27;t have a right to live if you are mentally handicapped or you&#x27;re physically handicapped or emotionally handicapped...we&#x27;re just not going to feed you anymore. To me, that is an atrocity worthy of Nazism.&quot;

On Hardball with Chris Matthews, after repeated questioning over why Michael Schiavo would want his wife&#x27;s feeding tube removed, Warren responded, &quot;I have no idea. Well, I don&#x27;t know. There&#x27;s a thousand reasons you could speculate. What if she came back out of the—out of this state and had something to say that he didn&#x27;t want said?&quot;

Two weeks before the 2008 U.S. general election, Warren issued a statement to his congregation endorsing California Proposition 8, which would amend the California Constitution to eliminate the right of same-sex couples to marry, a position consistent with the official position of his church&#x27;s denomination, the Southern Baptist Convention. After the measure passed, Warren&#x27;s church and others were targeted by protesters.

In an interview with Beliefnet in early December 2008, Warren again sparked controversy by appearing to equate same-sex marriages with marriages between siblings, marriages between multiple partners, and marriages between adults and minors. He later released a video message explaining that he does not equate gay relationships with incest or pedophilia, but that he opposes the redefinition of marriage. When Chelsea Clinton asked him about his views on same-sex marriage in December 2012, he said he recognized that it might become legal throughout the United States but added that, based on his belief in the Bible, he did not &quot;approve&quot; of it nor believe it was &quot;right.&quot; He said that using the word &quot;marriage&quot; to describe same-sex partnerships amounted to a &quot;redefinition&quot; of the word, suggested that the word belonged to the dominant culture (to religious people or to straight people) because the word has been used for &quot;a long time&quot;.

In a December 2012 interview, Warren publicly said that religious freedom will be the civil-rights issue of the next decade. He publicly denounced President Obama&#x27;s record on religious freedom, saying that Obama was &quot;absolutely unfriendly&quot; to religion.

In a May 2014 article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Warren expressed his support for David and Barbara Green, the owners of Hobby Lobby, in the &quot;Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.&quot; case before the U.S. Supreme Court. The case centered on the company&#x27;s request for a religious exemption to certain portions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act mandate that companies provide employee health insurance. Warren wrote, &quot;The [A]dministration wants everyone to render unto Caesar not only what is Caesar&#x27;s but also what is God&#x27;s. If it wins, the first purpose on which the United States was founded would be severely damaged.&quot;

== Controversies ==
=== Strategy for church growth ===
In 2006, &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; writer Suzanne Sataline cited examples of congregations that have split over the growth strategies and congregations that have expelled members who fought changes. She wrote, &quot;Warren acknowledges that splits occur in congregations that adopt his ideas, though he says he opposes efforts to expel church members.&quot;

=== Traditional view of marriage ===
In December 2008, when Warren was announced to lead a prayer at President Barack Obama&#x27;s inauguration in January, media outlets criticized the choice, accusing Warren of hate speech because he had written in a letter to his church in October that he believed the biblical definition of marriage between one man and one woman should not be changed. A few months earlier, in June 2008, he said that he had developed good relationships with several gay people because of the church&#x27;s ministry for people living with HIV/AIDS, without having to compromise his biblical beliefs and agree on all subjects. President Obama defended Warren, recalling that he had been invited to speak at Saddleback, despite his differing views on gay people, and that it was this kind of peaceful dialogue that he wanted to implement in inviting Warren. On another side, some evangelical pastors have criticized Warren for not being militant enough against same-sex marriage and abortion. To these critics, he replied that they put too much attention on the fight against gay marriage and abortion.

=== Social work with Muslims ===
In 2009 and 2012, evangelical pastors also criticized him for attending Islamic conferences and wanting to work with Muslims to solve global problems. To these criticisms, he responded that he sought to be a friend to all such as Jesus Christ.

<doc id="735155" wikidata="Q259356" url="?curid=735155" title="Ann Jones (tennis)">
<text>Ann Shirley Jones, (née Adrianne Haydon on 17 October 1938, also known as Ann Haydon-Jones) is a British former table tennis and lawn tennis champion. She won eight Grand Slam tennis championships in her career: three in singles, three in women&#x27;s doubles, and two in mixed doubles. As of 2023, she serves as a vice president of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club.

==Career==
===Table tennis===
Jones was born in Kings Heath, Birmingham, England. Her parents were prominent table tennis players, her father, Adrian Haydon, having been English number 1 and a competitor at world championships between 1928 and 1953. Ann, as a young girl, also took up the game, participating in five world championships in the 1950s, the best result being losing finalist in singles, doubles and mixed doubles all in Stockholm 1957. Soon after this she wrote the book &quot;Tackle Table Tennis This Way&quot;.

Jones also won two English Open titles in women&#x27;s doubles as Haydon.

===Tennis===

She was also a powerful lawn tennis player, winning the 1954 and 1955 British junior championships. In 1956, she won the Wimbledon girls&#x27; singles championship.

Jones played lawn tennis in a highly competitive era that included some of the greatest female tennis players of all time, such as Billie Jean King, Margaret Court, and Maria Bueno. Despite the fierce competition, she won the 1961 French Championships, beating Margaret Smith, former champion Zsuzsa Körmöczy and Yola Ramírez and reached the final of the 1961 U.S. Championships, beating Wimbledon champion Angela Mortimer, losing to the defending champion Darlene Hard. In 1962, she married Philip F. Jones and played as Ann Haydon-Jones. A debilitating back and neck injury hampered her career in 1964/1965, yet she recovered sufficiently to reach the quarterfinals of the French championships in 1965, yet was controversially unseeded for that year&#x27;s Wimbledon singles. This led to a fourth-round clash with the top-seeded defending champion Maria Bueno, which many thought was an imbalanced draw. Jones won the French title for a second time in 1966, beating Maria Bueno and Nancy Richey. She also won the Italian championships that year, beating Françoise Dürr and Annette Van Zyl.

At both the Wimbledon Championships and the U.S. Championships in 1967, Jones lost in the final to King. Two years later, however, the two again met in the Wimbledon final. This time, Jones took the most coveted title in the sport, making her the first left-handed female player to do so. She rounded off that year&#x27;s Wimbledon by winning the mixed doubles championship with Australia&#x27;s Fred Stolle. Her performances resulted in her being voted the BBC Sports Personality of the Year. Jones made Wimbledon 1969 her last Grand Slam singles event. She was seeded number one for the 1969 US Open but withdrew before the tournament began. She radically reduced her playing schedule for 1970, playing in South Africa where she won the Orange Free State Championships and the Western Province Championships. She then largely played only events in the United Kingdom for the remainder of the year. She returned to the international scene to play the Federation Cup event in Australia, where she partnered Virginia Wade on the British team. In 1971, Jones played on the Virginia Slims circuit, winning the U.S.$10,000 first prize for the event staged in Las Vegas, beating King in the final. Jones more or less retired after this event as she was expecting her first child. However, she continued to play the occasional UK event and was part of the 1975 Wightman Cup team for Great Britain. In 1977, Jones teamed with Winnie Wooldridge to play doubles at Wimbledon.

According to Lance Tingay and Bud Collins, Jones was ranked in the world top 10 from 1957 through 1963 and from 1965 through 1970, reaching a career high of world No. 2 in these rankings in 1967 and 1969.

According to Mark Lewisohn in &quot;The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions&quot;, on 4 July 1969, The Beatles paused the dubbing session for their song &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; to listen to Jones beat King for the Wimbledon title when live on radio.

With the dawn of the open era in 1968, Jones joined King and others to organise the first professional female touring group. In 1970, she was hired by the BBC as a guest commentator and worked with it for over three decades, occasionally commentating for tennis coverage on U.S. TV stations. Jones was chairwoman of the Women&#x27;s International Tennis Council and for many years the British team captain for events such as the Federation and Wightman Cups.

Over her career, she reached six Wimbledon semifinals in addition to her two appearances in the final: in 1958, beating Maria Bueno and losing to defending champion Althea Gibson; 1960, beating Renée Schuurman Haygarth and losing to Sandra Reynolds; 1962, beating Billie Jean Moffitt and losing to eventual champion Karen Hantze Susman; 1963, losing to runner-up Billie Jean Moffitt; 1966, beating Nancy Richey and losing a three-set match to Maria Bueno; and 1968 losing, after leading by a set and a break, to holder Billie Jean King. In the U.S. Nationals, as well as her final appearances in 1961 and 1967, Ann Jones reached three semifinals: in 1959, beating second-seed Sandra Reynolds (Price) and losing to Christine Truman; in 1963, beating second-seed Darlene Hard and losing 9–7 in the third set to eventual winner Maria Bueno; and in 1968, losing to eventual winner Virginia Wade.

As well as winning the French Championships twice, Jones reached three other French finals, beating Annette Van Zyl and losing to Nancy Richey in 1968, and beating Rosemary Casals and Lesley Turner and losing in three sets to Margaret Court in 1969. Of her three losing finals in the French championships, there was one which nearly added to her total of wins: 1963 when she led Lesley Turner 5–2 in the final set. She also reached the semifinals in 1957 aged 18, beating third seed Christiane Mercelis and losing a tough semifinal to Dorothy Head Knode, and in 1962 beating Jan Lehane and losing to Lesley Turner.

In the British Hard Courts championships, after losing in the finals in 1958 to Shirley Bloomer Brasher and 1960 to Christine Truman, she was undefeated from 1963 to 1966, winning finals against Norma Baylon, Jan Lehane, Annette Van Zyl and Virginia Wade. She was a stalwart in the Wightman Cup from 1957 (aged 18, beating Darlene Hard, then Wimbledon finalist) to 1967, 1970 and 1975, winning the deciding match in 1958 against Mimi Arnold when Britain won for the first time since 1930, taking both her singles against Billie Jean Moffitt and Nancy Richey in 1965 and overall winning nine singles and six doubles. Despite playing at a time when there were four other British winners of the French, Australian, US and Wimbledon titles, (Mortimer, Brasher, Truman and Wade), she was ranked no. 1 in the UK on seven occasions. Naturally a baseliner and effective as such on clay (Tiiu Kivi said it was like playing a brick wall that moved), she schooled herself to become a most effective net player, perhaps seen at her best when attacking Margaret Court to defeat in the Wimbledon semifinal of 1969. Apart from Althea Gibson, early in her career, there was not a leading player of her era that she did not beat on several occasions.

==Personal life==
In 1971 she published her tennis autobiography &quot;A Game to Love&quot;.

Jones caused something of a stir on 30 August 1962 when she married businessman Philip &quot;Pip&quot; Jones (1907–1993) who was 31 years her senior and five years older than her father. Pip Jones became the first Tour Director of the Virginia Slims Women&#x27;s Tennis Tour in 1971. The couple&#x27;s names later became a recurring gag on &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; during its series run, wherein the Pythons frequently inserted &quot;Ann Haydon-Jones and her husband Pip&quot; into any sketch where a list of names was being read.

In 1969, West Bromwich Albion commended Ann Jones on her sporting success and stated that she and her husband were supporters of the club.

==Awards==
In 1985, Jones was voted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. For many years, Jones was chairwoman of the International Women&#x27;s Tennis Council and has long been a member of Wimbledon&#x27;s Committee of Management. She became the first &#x27;civilian woman&#x27; (i.e., not a member of the British Royal Family) to present the trophies at Wimbledon when she awarded the winners of the Mixed Doubles championship their cup in 2007, a ceremony she now regularly performs. She also has presented the junior girls trophy.

Already a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), Jones was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2014 New Year Honours for services to tennis.

The stadium court at the Edgbaston Priory Tennis Club was renamed the &quot;Ann Jones Centre Court&quot; in 2013.

<text>Anders Frisk (born 18 February 1963) is a Swedish insurance agent by trade and a former football referee. Frisk chose to go into early retirement from refereeing due to pressure from death threats made against him and his family. He is fluent in several languages including his native Swedish, English and German.

==Career==
Frisk was born on 18 February 1963 in the Swedish city of Gothenburg, and lives in Mölndal, his hometown, where he runs a historic cinema. He began refereeing in 1978 and took charge of Swedish top-division matches for the first time in 1989. He was awarded his FIFA badge in 1991. In addition to refereeing at the highest level, Frisk also acts as an ambassador for the UEFA/International Committee of the Red Cross campaign highlighting the plight of children in war. He travelled to Sierra Leone for a first-hand view of the ICRC&#x27;s work, and declared himself deeply moved by the scenes of reunited families.

In 1991, he travelled to Switzerland to take charge of matches in the UEFA European Under-16 Championship final round. He became a FIFA international referee at the age of 28, his first international match was Iceland against Turkey on 17 July 1991. A stint at the FIFA Under-17 World Championship in Japan two years later was followed by recognition at elite UEFA levels.

Picked for Euro 96 in England, Frisk refereed the 3-3 group match between Russia and the Czech Republic in Liverpool. He was forced to miss the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France in 1998 with a back injury, but recovered in time to take charge of the 1999 Confederations Cup final between Brazil and Mexico in the Estadio Azteca, Mexico City. Soon after, he was selected to officiate the Euro 2000 final between France and Italy at the Feijenoord Stadion in Rotterdam.

After that appointment, he took charge of two matches in the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan: a group match between Brazil and China, and a second-round match between the Republic of Ireland and Spain. The referee for the Final, Pierluigi Collina, later wrote in his autobiography that Frisk had been the only other official that he had considered to have the credentials to receive the appointment. Later in 2004, Frisk took charge of the Champions League semi-final, second leg between Chelsea and Monaco. He also appeared at Euro 2004, refereeing the semi-final between Netherlands and Portugal and he was fourth official in the final.

In September 2004, Frisk was forced to abandon a match he was refereeing between Roma and Dynamo Kyiv at the Stadio Olimpico in the group stage of the 2004–05 Champions League after he was hit by a coin thrown from the stands as he walked off the field at half-time. He was seen to be bleeding, and subsequently abandoned the match. UEFA eventually awarded the match to Kyiv as a 3–0 forfeit, and ordered that Roma play its remaining two home fixtures in the group stage behind closed doors.

On 12 March 2005, Frisk announced his immediate retirement, citing threats made against his family following a UEFA Champions League tie between Barcelona and Chelsea, during which he sent off Chelsea&#x27;s Didier Drogba for receiving two cautions. Chelsea&#x27;s manager, José Mourinho, accused Frisk of inviting Barça manager, Frank Rijkaard, into his room at half-time. UEFA charged Chelsea with inappropriate conduct following the match and Mourinho received a touchline ban for both legs of Chelsea&#x27;s quarter-final against Bayern Munich.

On 19 December, Frisk was awarded FIFA&#x27;s Presidential Award as &quot;recognition for a career cut short following death threats against his family&quot;. He presided over 118 international games during his 18-year career.

<text>Louis Leo Snyder (4 July 1907 – 25 November 1993) was an American scholar, who witnessed first hand the Nazi mass rallies held from 1923 on in Germany; and wrote about them from New York in his &quot;Hitlerism: The Iron Fist in Germany&quot; published in 1932 under the pseudonym Nordicus. Snyder predicted Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, Nazi alliance with Benito Mussolini, and possibly the war upon the French and the Jews. His book was the first publication of the complete NSDAP National Socialist Program in the English language.

Snyder authored more than 60 books. He compiled the &quot;Encyclopedia of the Third Reich&quot; (1976), wrote &quot;Roots of German Nationalism&quot; (1978), and &quot;Diplomacy in Iron&quot; (1985) among other works examining the Third Reich. He also wrote &quot;The Dreyfus Case&quot; (1973) which divided France over the Dreyfus affair at turn of the century.

==Life==
Louis Snyder was a native of Annapolis, Maryland, and graduated from that city&#x27;s St. John&#x27;s College, cum laude, in 1928. He became a German-American Exchange Fellow in 1928 at the University of Frankfurt am Main, where he earned his doctorate in 1931. He was also an Alexander von Humboldt Foundation Fellow in 1929–1930. Following post-doctoral work at Columbia University, he started tutoring at City College of New York in 1933.

Snyder was appointed a full professor at City College in 1953 and retired to Princeton, New Jersey in 1977 after a total of forty-four years of teaching. He was the general editor of the David Van Nostrand Company&#x27;s Anvil Books. He died in Princeton in 1993.

<doc id="735163" wikidata="Q6796607" url="?curid=735163" title="May Week">
<text>May Week is the name used in the University of Cambridge to refer to a period at the end of the academic year. Originally May Week took place in the week during May before year-end exams began. Nowadays, May Week takes place in June after exams, and is a cause for great celebration amongst the students of the University. Highlights of the week include bumps races, May Balls, June Events and garden parties.

==History==

May Week festivities were originally held in May, in the final week before exams; however, the May boat races, also known as the May Bumps, moving toward June, right after exams to celebrate the year end.

==Suicide Sunday==

&quot;Suicide Sunday&quot; is the name used at Cambridge University to refer to the Sunday immediately after the end of the summer term (known as Easter Term). By this Sunday, all students have finished exams but most of the results have not been published, so it is traditionally a period of nerves and suspense. A student-led campaign in 2015 encouraged use of the name &quot;May Week Sunday&quot; instead, though &quot;Suicide Sunday&quot; continues to persist among students and the public.

The name refers to the celebration of the end of exam term, in contrast to Caesarian Sunday on the day before the early May Bank Holiday which is named after the Jesus College drinking society, the Caesarians. Caesarian Sunday is traditionally a final opportunity for students to get drunk on Jesus Green before exams begin.

The events are for current students of the University of Cambridge but are frequented by former students that indulge in the student lifestyle.

The Cardboard Boat Race is a main attraction to Suicide Sunday, offering an alternative to the many garden parties and more serious boating. The first race was in 2010, with three boats from Magdalene College. In 2011, the race was opened to other colleges.

== May Week Alternative ==
May Week Alternative (MWA), is a &quot;feel good&quot; initiative set up by undergraduates at Cambridge University to encourage students to celebrate the end of the academic year through charitable endeavours. In the organisation&#x27;s first 3 years, it attracted the support of approximately 650 students, and raised £150,000, protecting almost 180,000 people from malaria according to the Against Malaria Foundation.

=== Aims ===
The organisation states three main aims:

# Direct impact: MWA seeks to raise money for AMF and in doing so transform tens of thousands of lives by providing life-saving anti-malaria nets.
# Put charity at the heart of May Week celebrations: The initiative attempts to equip students with a positive framework which allows them to celebrate May Week by making the world a better place. By inviting students to see charity as a central and positive part of the May Week experience, MWA believes it can &quot;unlock huge philanthropic potential&quot;.
# Inspire students with a bold, positive vision for giving: By inviting students to engage with significant giving through this explicitly positive, celebratory context, May Week Alternative hopes that students will develop philanthropic tendencies which they will take forward into their future careers, rather than seeing charity as a burden.

=== Chronology ===

* In the spring of 2018, a group of five students founded the initiative and raised £12,000 for AMF, with over 40 students joining.
* In February 2019 MWA hosted its first annual Launch Party. MWA also presented at various events, including the Cambridge International Development Conference, Cambridge Union, and TEDxCambridgeUniversity
* In the same month it was one of only four initiatives recognised at Cambridge University&#x27;s first ever Social Impact Awards.
* In March 2019, MWA raised over £36,000 (having acquired matched funding), with more than 170 students joining. This total was triple the previous year and according to AMF&#x27;s calculations is sufficient protect 40,000 people from malaria.
* In June 2019 the initiative hosted a Summer Party with over 140 participants, and the support of 11 university and corporate partners.
* In 2020, the cancellation of all May Balls and other May Week events as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic lead to the creation of The May Week Mega Event. Co-hosted by May Week Alternative, Cambridge Rag (student society), and the May Ball Presidents&#x27; Committee, this virtual celebration of May Week featured over 500 performers from across the university in a four and a half hour livestream, attracting over 10,000 viewers. Over the course of the evening, over £14,000 was raised to support Addenbrooke&#x27;s Charitable Trust and the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk.

<doc id="735167" wikidata="Q783269" url="?curid=735167" title="Bingham, Nottinghamshire">
<text>Bingham is a market town and civil parish in the Rushcliffe borough of Nottinghamshire, England, east of Nottingham, 12 miles (18.8 km) south-west of Newark-on-Trent and 15 miles (23.3 km) west of Grantham. The town had a population of 9,131 at the 2011 census (up from 8,655 in 2001), with the population now sitting at 10,080 from the results of the 2021 census data.

Bingham is twinned with Wallenfels in Bavaria, Germany. Music groups have visited to and from the twin towns, and a beer festival is held in Bingham every year.

==Geography==
Bingham lies near the junction of the A46 (following an old Roman road, the Fosse Way) between Leicester and Newark-on-Trent and the A52 between Nottingham and Grantham. Neighbouring communities are Radcliffe-on-Trent, East Bridgford, Car Colston, Scarrington, Aslockton, Whatton-in-the-Vale, Tithby and Cropwell Butler.

==History==
===Margidunum===
The first known people to settle at this area were the Coritani, a Briton tribe that governed most of the East Midlands who would have called the fort &quot;Marigidun&quot;, which meant &quot;fort-of-the-king&#x27;s plain&quot;. This name would later be Latinised to &quot;Margidunum&quot;. The Romans built a fortress at this site, the ruins of which lay north of Bingham, and a settlement at the river crossing at &quot;Ad Pontem&quot; (East Stoke) on the Fosse Way, which ran between &quot;Isca&quot; (Exeter) and &quot;Lindum&quot; (Lincoln).

===Anglo-Saxons===
The area was called Byngehamshou Hundred by the Anglo-Saxons and Binghamshou Wapentake by the Danish. It would also have been called Bynnaingham, then Bynningaham, and later morphed into Byngeham. This name comes from the chief of the Angle tribe that settled the town, named &quot;Bynna&quot;, followed by the connective &quot;ing&quot; meaning &quot;of&quot;, and &quot;ham&quot; meaning &quot;homestead&quot;. Hou, meaning &quot;hill&quot;, would have referred to a meeting point of the Hundred Court, who met in the Moot-House Pit, which is on a hill near the Fosse Way. Later, the town would be referred to &quot;Binghehā&quot; in the Domesday Book.

This Anglo-Saxon village, founded around the start of the 7th century, would have been oval shaped, surrounded by a ditch and huts. The Bynna &quot;kindred&quot; (an Anglo-Saxon pagan family unit) placed their village next to a marshland, a source of water which would later be drained, leaving extremely valuable fertile lands for farming. Bingham would have converted to Christianity at around the same time as the rest of the Kingdom of Mercia, around the second half of the 7th century.

===Normans===
Following the Norman conquest of England, the Domesday Book of 1086 allows us to estimate that the village had a population of around 300, and that the majority of freeholders in the district were Danes. The first Norman owner of the manor surrounding Bingham was Roger de Busli, however he died without an heir after only a few years and so Bingham Manor became part of the King&#x27;s demesne, and even now much of Bingham remains crown land. The Domesday book valued the town and surrounding area at £10 13s, which today is worth around £90,000.

Bingham acquired a market charter in 1341.

===Tudors=== 

During the reign of Elizabeth I Tudor, the Bingham Manor was owned by Sir Bryan Stapleton, who lived in Carlton, although he lent out the manor to a man named Thomas Leeke, who was possibly the maternal grandfather of Bess of Hardwick. At this time, farming in Bingham was quite collectivistic, with lots of common area in the Bingham moors to keep pigs and to collect firewood. In order to maintain these common lands, the Manor Court, which met around the Church gate, contained 5 elected officers. A foreman of the fields, A hayward in charge of the common grazing land, a pindar in charge of the pinfold (an enclosure for stray livestock), a ringer for hogs and swine, and a woodward who made sure that not too many trees were chopped down.

===Civil War===
During the English Civil War, Bingham was stood in the middle of the Parliamentary stronghold of Nottingham and the Royalist stronghold in Newark. Prince Rupert, on his way to relieve Newark, encamped in the fields surrounding Bingham. Given that 700 roundhead soldiers sought refuge in Bingham, a conclusion could be drawn that it was generally sympathetic to the Parliamentary cause, especially given that many men of Bingham would have died in battles around Nottingham.

===Industrial Revolution===
In 1801, the population of Bingham was 1,082. This increased slowly to 2,054 in 1851, but fell back again and in 1901 was just 1,604. In 1951 it was 1,692, and since then Bingham has expanded vastly. Although some buildings in the centre of the town such as Church of St Mary and All Saints were built in the 18th century, the majority of the buildings in Bingham are relatively new and much of the growth in the town happened after the second World War.

The first major wave of growth in the town happened around the time of the Industrial Revolution as the workforce expanded and more housing was needed for the growing population of the town. This was compounded by the arrival of the railways into the town in 1851, although as England&#x27;s agricultural sector began to decline and the cottage industry of lace and stocking knitting were overtaken by factories in Nottingham, Bingham would plunge into high levels of poverty and unemployment. A sharp decline in population and growth followed this, and the town would not recover until after the second World War.

===Post-war redevelopment===
After the war, the Bingham Rural District Council inspected the state of over 2,000 houses in the area to see if they needed to be demolished or could be repaired for the redevelopment. It was decided in the redevelopment that farming property should remain out in the countryside instead of mixed in with the other residential properties. Some notable buildings that were destroyed are Stanhope Workhouse on Stanhope Way and the Rectory on East Street, drastically changing the look of the town. The 1960s and 1970s saw almost constant development with new houses being built to accommodate the local population. More recently, a new housing development in the north of Bingham named the Romans&#x27; Quarter (after the nearby Ancient Roman site of Margidunum) started around 2018 with plans for around 1,000 new houses.

==Amenities==
===Schools and library===

Bingham has five schools, Robert Miles Infants School opened in 1909, Robert Miles Junior School built in the 1960s on the site of the Rectory, Carnarvon Primary School, Bingham Primary School &amp; Nursery, and Toot Hill Comprehensive School. 
Two other schools operated in the past, the Church School and the Wesleyan School, the latter of which shut down in 1909 and was demolished in 2002.

Bingham&#x27;s library has existed in some form since around the late 1950s, starting as a &quot;charity penny library&quot; in a lean-to on 7-9 Newgate Street. Eventually the County Library took it over, and in 1973 it was moved Eaton Place, where it remains to this day.

===Churches===

The Anglican parish Church of St. Mary and All Saints, Bingham, occupies a Grade I listed medieval building restored in 1845–1846 and again in 1912. It has a peal of eight bells and a 19th-century organ. It belongs to the Diocese of Southwell and Nottingham.

A new Bingham Methodist Church and social centre, built by public subscription, opened on 1 April 2016 at Eaton Place, on the site of the earlier church. It belongs to the Grantham and Vale of Belvoir Circuit. Archive documents for Bingham Methodist Circuit date back to 1843.

===Economy===

The open-air food market in the central Market Place takes place every Thursday and a farmers&#x27; market there on the third Saturday of the month. Bingham provides shopping, medical and other services to surrounding villages. Planning permission was gained to build a large supermarket near the town centre, but the planned site was later used to build the new Bingham Arena Leisure Centre. In March 2015 planning permission was given for two other chain supermarkets.

To the north of the town there is an industrial estate holding about 40 businesses. The largest include Midland Filtration, Screwfix, Focus Label Machinery, Trent Designs, XACT Document Solutions, The Workplace Depot and Water at Work, and a business club.

===Leisure and sports===

Of the six pubs in the town, four remain as such: &quot;The Butter Cross&quot; (Wetherspoons, formerly &quot;The Crown&quot;), &quot;The Horse &amp; Plough&quot; (Castle Rock Brewery), &quot;The White Lion&quot; and &quot;The Wheatsheaf&quot;. There is also a bar/bistro called &quot;Gilt&quot; and a Cafe/bar called &quot;Cured&quot;.

Bingham Arena has sports facilities, a swimming pool, conference facilities and a large assembly hall. This replaced the former Bingham Leisure centre, next to Toot Hill School.

Bingham has Scout troops with about 140 young members: 1st Bingham Scouts includes Beavers and Cubs.

==Transport==

Trentbarton provides a frequent public bus service into Nottingham.
Bingham&#x27;s main railway station provides an hourly service to and beyond Nottingham and Grantham and to Skegness along the Poacher Line. Another station south of Bingham named Bingham Road was opened on the Nottingham-Leicester-Northampton Line. It closed in 1951 to passengers and 1964 to freight. The station site has been demolished and the trackbed is now used as a greenway.

Bus services are provided by Vectare, 
Centrebus,
and Trentbarton.

The A46, to the west of the town, was upgraded and completed in 2013 as a grade-separated dual carriageway. The Widmerpool-Newark Improvement has been diverted to the west of the former Roman town to preserve archaeological remains. The A52 bypass to the south of the town opened in December 1986.

<doc id="735169" wikidata="Q203657" url="?curid=735169" title="Jon Dahl Tomasson">
<text>Jon Dahl Tomasson (; born 29 August 1976) is a Danish football manager and former player. He is the current manager of the Sweden national team.

A forward, his most notable run of football came in his first stint at Feyenoord, with whom he won the 2002 UEFA Cup, and Italian club AC Milan, with whom he won the UEFA Champions League in 2003 and reached the final in 2005. He also played top-flight football in England, Germany and Spain. He is the joint all-time top goalscorer for the Denmark national team with 52 goals in 112 games and was also honoured with the Danish &quot;Player of the Year&quot; award in both 2002 and 2004. He played at the UEFA European Championship in 2000 and 2004 and the FIFA World Cup in 2002 and 2010.

After his playing career, Tomasson went into coaching, being both assistant and manager in the Netherlands, before becoming assistant manager in the Denmark national team under Åge Hareide. In 2020, Tomasson became the manager of Malmö and left two years later after winning the Swedish championship for two consecutive seasons. In June 2022, he was appointed the head coach of Blackburn Rovers. He left Blackburn by mutual consent in February 2024 and later that month was appointed as the new head coach of Sweden.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in Copenhagen, son of Bjarne Tomasson and Leila Dahl Petersen, Tomasson first started playing football as a five-year-old in the youth team of Solrød. At nine years of age, he moved to the biggest club in the area, Køge. In November 1992, at 16, he made his senior debut for the club. During the next two years he helped the club to get promoted twice in a row: at the end of the 1993 season, when the club was promoted from the Denmark Series to the second Division; and at the end of the 1994 season, when the club was promoted to the first Division.

===Heerenveen===
In December 1994, aged 18, he agreed on a transfer from Køge to the Dutch club Heerenveen, of the Eredivisie. A first-team regular by the 1995–96 season, Tomasson was the club top scorer for the season as well, netting 14 goals in 30 league matches. He increased this tally in the 1996–97 season to 18, and was top-scorer for the club once again. On top of that, he also won the &quot;Best Dutch Football Talent of 1996&quot;, beating the likes of Boudewijn Zenden and Patrick Kluivert to the prize.

===Newcastle United===
His success attracted the interest of other clubs, and he completed a high-profile move to FA Premier League club Newcastle United in July 1997. Newcastle&#x27;s manager at the time, Kenny Dalglish, saw Tomasson as the perfect link-up player to England national team striker Alan Shearer. The partnership initially worked well, with Tomasson impressing during a pre-season friendly tournament in the Republic of Ireland. However, a career threatening injury to Shearer, combined with the transfer of striker Les Ferdinand to Tottenham Hotspur, meant that Tomasson was moved from his traditional attacking midfield position to that of striker. He struggled to adapt to his new position on the field, and to the English game, due to his lack of physical strength. He scored only four goals in 35 appearances in all competitions during the 1997–98 season.

===Feyenoord===
Tomasson returned to the Eredivisie in July 1998, where he joined Feyenoord, once again as an attacking midfielder. The club won the Eredivisie championship for the 1998–99 season, and the Dutch Super Cup. Although Feyenoord did not manage to remain as champions in the following years, they still performed well enough to capture third place in 1999–00, second place in 2000–01, and third place again in 2001–02. In his latter two seasons, Tomasson scored 15 and 17 Eredivisie goals respectively, forming a partnership with Pierre van Hooijdonk, who was 2002&#x27;s league top scorer with 24 goals.

In 2002, Tomasson was an integral player in the Feyenoord team, that won its first international trophy in 26 years, when the club triumphed in the 2001–02 UEFA Cup tournament. He scored four goals in the tournament and also had an impressive collaboration on the field with striker Pierre van Hooijdonk. During the tournament, they defeated SC Freiburg, Rangers, PSV Eindhoven and Internazionale, before meeting German team Borussia Dortmund in the final. Tomasson scored the goal to 3–1, in a game that ended 3–2 to Feyenoord, and he was subsequently voted man of the match.

===Milan===
On 2 May 2002, as Tomasson&#x27;s contract with Feyenoord was expiring before their UEFA Cup victory, he agreed a move to Italy on a four-year free transfer, to play for Serie A club A.C. Milan. He joined compatriots Martin Laursen and Thomas Helveg at the San Siro club.

The 2002–03 season, Tomasson&#x27;s first at Milan, saw them winning the Italian Cup. Tomasson was most often used as a late substitute, but did manage to score three goals in the UEFA Champions League; and thereby also held his share of the trophy, when Milan won the prestigious tournament in May 2003. Tomasson missed the final because of an injury that he picked up in the first leg of the 2003 Coppa Italia Final. During the 2003–04 season, Tomasson was given more playing time and managed to score 12 Serie A goals in a title-winning campaign. In August 2004, he was also a part of the Milan team that won the Italian Super Cup, with a 3–0 victory against the Coppa Italia champions Lazio.

For the next 2004–05 season, he struggled to secure a regular starting place in the line-up of Milan. He was once again in the role of substitute, and therefore also scored fewer goals compared to the previous season. At the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final against Liverpool, he was again used by Milan as a late substitute, and when the final had to be decided in penalty shootout, he was selected to kick. Tomasson scored on his attempt, but Milan lost as Serginho, Andrea Pirlo and Andriy Shevchenko missed their shots. When striker Christian Vieri joined the club in July 2005, Tomasson was deemed as potential surplus, and he therefore agreed with Milan to be placed at their transfer list.

Years later, prior to the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League round of 16 match between Chelsea and Copenhagen, former Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti, now manager of Real Madrid, was asked about his view on Danish footballers: &quot;Above all the Danish work ethic surprised me, their special ability to give everything in training. These were very professional and skilled players. The one who performed best and showed the most continuity, was Jon Dahl Tomasson, who always had to fight for playing time against world class strikers. He never had an easy time, but he never gave up and tried to take every chance he got&quot;.

===VfB Stuttgart===
In July 2005, the German Bundesliga club VfB Stuttgart paid a transfer fee to Milan of €7.5 million, in order to sign Tomasson to a four-year contract. He joined international teammate Jesper Grønkjær at the club but the upcoming 2005–06 season was not successful for either of them. Even though Tomasson was the team&#x27;s top scorer with eight Bundesliga goals, the team struggled throughout the season to create enough chances and goals, and as a consequence Stuttgart only finished in ninth position of the Bundesliga. After the season, Grønkjær left the club, while Tomasson stayed and in the 2006–07 season Stuttgart became the new champions of the Bundesliga.

===Villarreal===
On 24 January 2007, Tomasson was loaned to Villarreal in the Spanish Primera División championship, to cover the place of the injured striker Nihat Kahveci, for the remaining part of the 2006–07 season. When he made his Villarreal debut, in a game against Real Madrid, Tomasson became only the fifth player to have played in the Premier League, Serie A, Bundesliga and Primera División. This rare achievement had previously only been made by the four players: Florin Răducioiu, Gheorghe Popescu, Abel Xavier and Pierre Womé.

His loan contract expired on 1 July 2007, but also featured a buying option, for which Villarreal paid Stuttgart the second half of a total transfer fee at €1 million in order to sign Tomasson to a two-year contract . In the first match of the 2007–08 La Liga season, he scored in a 3–0 victory against Valencia, but he mostly played the club&#x27;s UEFA Cup games that season, and scored five goals in eight games. The season ended as the best ever for Villarreal, who were runners-up in La Liga.

===Return to Feyenoord===
Tomasson agreed with Villarreal in June 2008 to search the market for a possible transfer. The Spanish sportspaper Marca immediately linked him together with Dutch side Feyenoord. This was at first described by Tomasson as pure speculation. The speculation, however, turned out to be true. In July 2008, he left Villarreal on a free transfer, and returned to Feyenoord on a new three-year contract. He made a fine start with four goals in three games. But this was followed by an injury from the end of September until the end of January, which meant he could only play a total of 14 games for Feyenoord in 2008–09.
In the next 2009–10 season, he again had to battle with a couple of injuries. But during the season he was still able to play another 28 games for Feyenoord, where he scored a club-best 12 goals. With his good performance on the field, he helped Feyenoord to achieve a fourth place in the Eredivisie, and help the club to reach the final of the Dutch Cup. The final was played over two legs, and Feyenoord lost 6–1 on aggregate to Ajax, with Tomasson scoring the only goal for Feyenoord. During the 2010 World Cup, he was hit by another serious injury, that spoiled his first half of the 2010–11 season for Feyenoord. According to the medical staff at Feyenoord, the injury was a lot worse than original thought. When they tried to get him ready for a game at 15 August, the injury had not entirely healed; and after a too hard training session, it therefore reappeared at its previous strength. Based upon further examination of the injury, the coach now feared that Tomasson only would be ready to play his first game of the season in January 2011.

==International career==
Tomasson scored 10 goals in 16 games for the national under-19 team, and was awarded 1994 Danish U-19 Player of the Year. In all, he scored 27 goals in 37 matches for various national youth selections.

After two good seasons with Heerenveen, Tomasson got a call-up to the Denmark national team, and he made his debut on 29 March 1997, against Croatia. During his time at Newcastle, reduced playing time saw Tomasson dropped by the Denmark national team, and he was not selected to play at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. When he moved to Feyenoord, Tomasson was once more called up for the Denmark national team in August 1998, and with six goals in seven matches of the Euro 2000 qualification, he quickly became an important part of the Danish team, playing as an attacking midfielder behind striker Ebbe Sand. He played in all Denmark&#x27;s three matches at the main Euro 2000 tournament, but did not score as Denmark were eliminated in the group stage. Before moving to Milan, he played for Denmark in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, where he scored four goals in as many games.

Tomasson played for Denmark at Euro 2004, where he scored three goals in four games and was selected for the Euro 2004 &quot;Team of the Tournament&quot;. On 28 May 2010, Denmark coach Morten Olsen announced that the player would be part of the final squad of 23 participating in the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. On 24 June, he scored against Japan in a 3–1 defeat as Denmark went out of the competition. He was rated by FIFA as the best Danish player of the tournament.

Tomasson scored a total of 52 goals in 112 games for Denmark throughout his career, which spanned from March 1997 to June 2010, making him joint all time goal scorer of the Denmark national team with Poul Nielsen. He played at Euro 2000, the 2002 World Cup, Euro 2004 and the 2010 World Cup. On 9 August 2010, having scored 52nd international goal in Denmark&#x27;s final match at the 2010 World Cup, Tomasson decided to retire from the national team. &quot;We say farewell to a terrific player and a fantastic person,&quot; national coach Olsen said, adding that Tomasson was &quot;the ultimate team player&quot;.

==Coaching career==

===Early coaching career===

Tomasson retired on 6 June 2011, and became assistant coach at Dutch club Excelsior. He became the club&#x27;s head coach at the beginning of the 2013–14 season. His debut was a 2–2 Eerste Divisie draw at home to Helmond Sport, and he took the Rotterdam-based team to the last 16 of the KNVB Cup before losing 2–1 at home to PEC Zwolle on 17 December.

Eredivisie side Roda JC sacked their head coach Ruud Brood on 15 December 2013, and signed Tomasson eleven days later, on a 3-year deal, effective 3 January. He made his debut 15 days later in a 2–2 draw at his former club Heerenveen. After the second half of the season, which resulted in relegation, he was dismissed on 26 May 2014.

On 19 June 2015, Tomasson was appointed as the new assistant manager of Vitesse. On 7 March 2016, he was appointed as an assistant coach of the Danish national team. During a 3-year tenure, he helped the Danish national team qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and the 2020 UEFA European Championship. The team did not lose a game for three years.

===Malmö===
On 5 January 2020, Tomasson was appointed as the new manager of Swedish Allsvenskan side Malmö. He led the team to the 2020 Allsvenskan title in his first season with the club, winning Malmö its 21st Swedish Championship.

In his second season with Malmö, he took the club to the group stage of Champions League after succeeding in four qualification rounds, including beating Rangers in the third round and Ludogorets Razgrad in the fourth. In December 2021, Tomasson and Malmö won their second consecutive Allsvenskan league title. On 30 December, he left by his own request.

===Blackburn Rovers===
On 14 June 2022, Tomasson was appointed as the new head coach of Blackburn Rovers. He signed a three-year deal at the club, stating: &quot;I&#x27;m really proud and excited to be taking over as head coach of Blackburn Rovers – a club with a lot of tradition and also great ambition.&quot; In the club&#x27;s first Championship match of the 2022–23 season, Blackburn won 1–0 at home to Queens Park Rangers with a long-range goal from Lewis Travis. Blackburn finished in 7th place in Tomasson&#x27;s first season at the club, narrowly missing out on the playoffs for promotion to the Premier League due to goal difference. Tomasson left Blackburn by mutual consent in February 2024, being replaced as head coach by John Eustace.

===Sweden===
On 26 February 2024, Tomasson was named as the new head coach of Sweden national team, replacing Janne Andersson. This resulted in Tomasson becoming the first non-Swede to coach the national team since the creation of this role.

== Personal life ==
Tomasson has two sons, Luca (born in 2008) and Liam (born in 2012), with his Danish wife Line Dahl Kongeskov Tomasson. He lives with his family in the Netherlands.

Tomasson is of Danish, Finnish and Icelandic heritage.

==Style of play==
Tomasson was known for his positional strength and fine finishing as a forward, despite his lack of notable pace or physicality. He also drew praise from pundits and managers for his discipline in training, and for his work-rate and movement off the ball, as well as his ability to create space for his teammates with his runs. A versatile player, he was capable of playing both as a striker and as a second striker.

<doc id="735176" wikidata="Q497096" url="?curid=735176" title="Hiram Bingham I">
<text>Hiram Bingham, formally Hiram Bingham I (October 30, 1789 – November 11, 1869), was the leader of the first group of American Protestant missionaries to introduce Christianity to the Hawaiian Islands. Like most of the missionaries, he was from New England.

==Life==
Bingham was descended from Deacon Thomas Bingham, who emigrated to the American colonies in 1650 and settled in Connecticut Colony. He was born October 30, 1789, in Bennington, Vermont, one of thirteen children of his mother, Lydia, and father, Calvin Bingham. He attended Middlebury College and the Andover Theological Seminary. He had as private tutor Rev. Elisha Yale, who taught him Greek and Latin and prepared him for higher education.

After breaking his first engagement Bingham found a new bride, Sybil Moseley. He needed to be married to be accepted as a missionary. On October 23, 1819, the young couple sailed out of Boston aboard the brig &quot;Thaddeus&quot; along with Asa and Lucy Goodale Thurston to lead a mission in the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) for the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.

==Hawaii==
Bingham and his wife arrived first on the island of Hawaii in 1820, and sailed on to Honolulu on Oahu on April 19. In 1823, Queen Kaahumanu and six high chiefs requested baptism. Soon after, the Hawaiian government banned prostitution and drunkenness, which resulted in the shipping industry and the foreign community resenting Bingham&#x27;s influence.
Bingham wrote extensively about the natives and was critical of their land-holding regime and of their &quot;state of civilization&quot;. He supported the introduction of market values along with Christianity: historians now reference his writings to illustrate the imperial values that were central to the attitudes of the United States towards Hawaii. Bingham became involved in the development of the spelling system for writing the Hawaiian language, and also translated parts of the Bible into Hawaiian.

Bingham designed the Kawaiahaʻo Church in Honolulu on the Hawaiian Island of Oahu. The building, constructed between 1836 and 1842 in the New England style typical of the Hawaiian missionaries, is one of the oldest standing Christian places of worship in Hawaii.

Bingham used his influence with Queen Kaʻahumanu to instigate a strongly anti-Catholic policy in Hawaii, considerably impeding the work of the French Catholic missionary Alexis Bachelot (1796-1837) and resulting in decades of persecution of those Hawaiians who converted to Catholicism. This was motivated by opposition to the spread of French influence in Hawaii as well as by the religious Protestant-Catholic rivalry and enmity.

==Legacy and honors==
* A math building in Punahou School is named after Bingham. 
* Bingham Tract School was an academically rigorous elementary school, named after him, and operated on the Bingham lands until the mid-1990s.

==Return==
The board grew concerned that Bingham was interfering too often in Hawaiian politics and recalled him. The Binghams left on August 3, 1840 and reached New England on February 4, 1841. It was intended to be a sabbatical owing to Sybil&#x27;s poor health, but the board refused to reappoint Bingham as a missionary, even after Sybil&#x27;s death on February 27, 1848. He published a memoir, &quot;A Residence of Twenty-One Years in the Sandwich Islands&quot;, in 1847.

Bingham remained in New England, where he served as the pastor of an African-American church. In 1852 he remarried, to Naomi Morse, who ran a girls&#x27; school. He died on November 11, 1869, and was buried at Grove Street Cemetery, in New Haven, Connecticut. Leonard Bacon gave the address at his funeral.

==Hawaiian Bible and hymns==
Bingham was the leader of a group of missionaries that included Asa Thurston and Artemas Bishop and they translated the Christian Bible into the Hawaiian language. The New Testament was published in 1832 and the Old Testament in 1839. The entire NT/OT Bible was revised in 1868 and was republished as &quot;Ka Baibala Hemolele&quot; (The Holy Bible) in 2018 in print and electronic forms.

Binamu (Bingham&#x27;s Hawaiian name) also composed Hawaiian hymns such as ‘Himeni Hope’ (closing hymn), starting with &quot;Ho&#x27;omaika&#x27;i i ka Makua Ke Akua o kakou, ...&quot;, meaning ‘Blessings to the Father, the God of us all, ...’, which were typically quiet and reflective but powerful. His hymns are still sung in Hawaii at the churches and by the choruses in concert.

==Legacy==
Bingham&#x27;s son, Hiram Bingham II, was also a missionary to the Kingdom of Hawaii. His daughter Lydia married the later Hawaiian missionary Titus Coan.

His grandson Hiram Bingham III was an explorer who brought Machu Picchu to the attention of the west and became a US Senator and Governor of Connecticut. Another grandson, Edwin Lincoln Moseley, was a naturalist.

His great-grandson Hiram Bingham IV was the US Vice Consul in Marseilles, France, during World War II and rescued Jews from the Holocaust. Another great-grandson, Jonathan Brewster Bingham, was a long-time Reform Democratic Congressman from The Bronx from the mid-1960s through the early 1980s.

 It was hull number 1726.

Bingham was caricatured as the character Reverend Abner Hale in James Michener&#x27;s novel &quot;Hawaii&quot;.

<text>Hiram &quot;Harry&quot; Bingham IV (July 17, 1903 – January 12, 1988) was an American diplomat. He served as a Vice Consul in Marseilles, France, during World War II, and, along with several humanitarian organizations, helped more than 2,500 refugees, mostly Jews, to escape after the country was defeated by Nazi Germany in June 1940. 

==Early life==
Bingham was one of seven sons of former Governor of Connecticut and U.S. Senator Hiram Bingham III and his first wife, Alfreda Mitchell, heiress of the Tiffany and Co. fortune through her maternal grandfather Charles L. Tiffany. His father was also the first American to explore the Inca ruins at Machu Picchu. His great-grandfather Hiram Bingham I and grandfather Hiram Bingham II were among the first Protestant missionaries to the Kingdom of Hawaii.

Bingham attended the Groton School and graduated from Yale University in 1925.

==Career==

===Foreign service===

Bingham served in Kobe, Japan, as a civilian secretary in the United States embassy. He worked part-time as a schoolteacher. He traveled to India and Egypt before returning to the United States to attend Harvard University. After obtaining his law degree, he scored third in his class on the foreign service exam.

Bingham&#x27;s first assignment in the United States Foreign Service was in Beijing, China, during the beginning of the communist revolution.

Bingham also served in Warsaw, Poland, sharing an apartment with another diplomat, Charles W. Yost, whose daughter, Felicity, became Bingham&#x27;s god-daughter. In 1934, Bingham served as third secretary to the United States Embassy in London.

===Vice Consul in France===
In 1939, Bingham was posted to the US Consulate in Marseilles, where he had responsibility for issuing entry visas to the United States.

On May 10, 1940, Adolf Hitler&#x27;s forces invaded France and the French government fell. The French signed an armistice with Germany and forced most of France&#x27;s large population of foreign refugees to move to internment camps. Many thousands of refugees went to Marseilles to seek visas for the United States and other foreign destinations.

Anxious to limit immigration into the United States and to maintain good relations with the Vichy government, the U.S. State Department actively discouraged diplomats from helping refugees. In Marseilles, as elsewhere, foreign service staff usually showed little flexibility or compassion towards the desperate refugees. However, American rescue workers soon noticed that &quot;Harry&quot; Bingham was an exception. Bingham personally toured some of the wretched internment camps and sought American aid to improve conditions. He helped many refugees to avoid internment and prepare for emigration and freely issued Nansen passports, a useful form of identity for stateless persons. An American rescue worker, Martha Sharp, organized a group of children to leave southern France for the US in late 1940. She had this to say about Bingham, &quot;I am proud that our government is represented in its Foreign Services by a man of your quality,&quot; she wrote. &quot;I feel so deeply about this that I shall take the earliest opportunity to transmit it through the Unitarian Service Committee to the United States State Department, for I believe that such humane and cooperative handling of individuals is what we need most coupled with intelligence and good breeding.&quot; Bingham also cooperated a great deal with Varian Fry, an effective rescue worker based in Vichy France during 1940 and 1941. Bingham worked with Fry on notable cases, including the emigration of Marc Chagall, political theorist Hannah Arendt, novelist Lion Feuchtwanger, and many other distinguished refugees. In the case of Feuchtwanger, Bingham went so far as to help spirit the novelist out of an internment camp and sheltered him in his own house while plans were made to help the refugee walk over the Pyrenees.

====Consequence====
In 1941, the United States government abruptly pulled Bingham from his position as Vice Consul and transferred him to Portugal and then Argentina. When he was in Argentina, he helped to track Nazi war criminals in South America. In early 1946, after being passed over for promotion, he resigned from the United States Foreign Service.
Bingham did not speak much about his wartime activities. His own family had little knowledge of them until after Bingham&#x27;s death in 1988. In 1991, Bingham&#x27;s widow Rose and son Thomas found 50-year-old Marseilles documents in the family&#x27;s Connecticut farmhouse. Rose and Thomas subsequently donated these documents to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Several years later, Bingham&#x27;s youngest son found documents in a cupboard behind a chimney and family members continued to unearth documents at the farmhouse. The materials told of Bingham&#x27;s struggle to save German and Jewish refugees from death, details long hidden from the public.

==Personal life==
While posted in London, he met Rose Lawton Morrison (1908–1996), a college drama teacher from Waycross, Georgia, whom he escorted to Buckingham Palace to meet the Queen. They later married and had 11 children, including Abigail Bingham Endicott, the mother of Sam Endicott. and Margaret Bingham Turner.

===Honors===
Although family members knew some of the details, the whole story became known only when Bingham&#x27;s youngest son William discovered a tightly wrapped bundle of letters, documents, and photographs hidden in the wall of a cupboard behind a chimney in the family home. As a consequence of the discovery, Hiram Bingham IV has been honored by many groups and organizations including the United Nations, the State of Israel, and by a traveling exhibit entitled &quot;Visas for Life: The Righteous and Honorable Diplomats&quot;. The exhibit records the events of that time and the efforts of Bingham and others who risked and lost so much to help their fellow man.

After considering for several years Bingham&#x27;s deeds during the war years in Marseilles, Israel&#x27;s memorial Yad Vashem (&quot;Holocaust Martyrs&#x27; and Heroes&#x27; Remembrance Authority&quot;) issued the Bingham family a letter of appreciation on March 7, 2005. Although not a Righteous Among the Nations designation, the letter noted the &quot;humanitarian disposition&quot; of Bingham IV &quot;at a time of persecution of Jews by the Vichy regime in France... [in] contrast to certain other officials who rather acted suspiciously toward Jewish refugees wishing to enter the United States.&quot;

On June 27, 2002, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell presented a posthumous &quot;Constructive Dissent&quot; award to Bingham&#x27;s children at an American Foreign Service Officers Association awards ceremony in Washington, D.C.. A commemorative postage stamp portraying Hiram Bingham IV as a &quot;Distinguished American Diplomat&quot; was issued by the United States Postal Service on May 30, 2006.

On October 27, 2006, the Anti-Defamation League posthumously presented Bingham its &quot;Courage to Care Award&quot; at the ADL&#x27;s national conference in Atlanta. In November 2006, the U.S. Episcopal Church added Bingham to a list of &quot;American Saints&quot; published in the book &quot;A Year with American Saints&quot; with a summary of his life and character.

On March 28, 2011, the Simon Wiesenthal Center posthumously awarded Bingham their Medal of Valor in New York City with a film tribute. The film shows the Nazis on the march in Europe and how US Vice-Consul Bingham rose to the dangerous occasion to save lives. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;more than 450 supporters of the Simon Wiesenthal Center gathered for the 2011 Humanitarian Award Dinner. The Medal of Valor was awarded posthumously to Sir Winston Churchill, Hiram Bingham IV, and Pope John Paul II...&quot;

<text>The La Chacarita Cemetery (, also known as &quot;Cementerio del Oeste&quot;) is a cemetery located in the Chacarita neighborhood in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Occupying an area of 95 hectare, it is the largest in the country.

Chacarita Cemetery has designated areas for members of the Argentine artistic community, including writers, prominent composers and actors. The late Justicialist leader and former President Juan Perón was buried here until his remains were relocated in 2006 to a mausoleum in his former home in San Vicente.

== History ==

The cemetery owes its existence to a yellow fever epidemic in 1871, when existing cemeteries were strained beyond capacity (the upscale La Recoleta Cemetery refused to allow the burial of victims of the epidemic). Until then, the &quot;Cementerio del Sud&quot; (opened in 1867 to bury the dead from cholera and typhoid fever epidemics, located in Parque Patricios) operated as the city&#x27;s cemetery. During the yellow fever epidemic over 700 people per day were buried there. When the capacity of 18,000 collapsed, the cemetery was closed and a search for a new place started. 

Governor Emlio Mitre created the &quot;Enterratorio General de Buenos Aires&quot;, which would be built on a land in the &quot;Chacarita de los Colegiales&quot;. The name &quot;chácara&quot; mean &quot;agricultural land&quot; while &quot;Colegiales&quot; referred to students of Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires that had spent their summertime at those lands since the 18th. century. In the northwest section, a 5-hectare land was chosen, in the same place where a cemetery owned by Jesuit priests existed. Lands that were part of &quot;Partido de Belgrano&quot; were expropriated. Those lands were used for agriculture purposes, most of them were gardens with a few ranches on them. Mitre also ordered the construction of a road to access the cemetery and a railroad.

The cemetery was opened on 14 April 1817, surrounded by Avenida Dorrego, Jorge Newbery, Avenida Corrientes, and Av. Guzmán. Its main entrance was located on Av. Corrientes. As the epidemic went by, coffins accumulated at the cemetery&#x27;s door, sometimes buries took a week due to the great amount of victims.
British rail company Buenos Aires Western Railway was commissioned to build a 6-km length line from the Buenos Aires downtown to the cemetery. It was nicknamed &quot;tren fúnebre&quot; and departed from Av. Corrientes and Ecuador (Bermejo station, a huge shed where the coffins were loaded). It had two sops, the first on Medrano street and the other on Ministro Inglés street (today Av. Scalabrini Ortiz) where the train loaded more coffins. Workshops were on Corrientes and Pueyrredón streets and they served as terminus for a short time.

Works (that had a cost of m$n 2,2 million) were directed by French engineer Augusto Ringuelet who finished it on 11 April. Trains were pulled by &quot;La Porteña&quot;, the locomotive that had served in the inauguration of the Argentine railway network in 1857. The last wagon was occupied by dead relatives. The service had a frequency of 2 trains per day. Between February and June, more than 15,000 people died.
In that first Chacarita Cemetery (also known as &quot;Cementerio Viejo&quot;), 3,423 people were buried until it was closed in 1886. The current Chacarita Cemetery was officially established on 9 December 1886. It had been projected by French engineer Enrique Clement during the government of major Torcuato de Alvear, and was initially named &quot;Cementerio del Oeste&quot; but then renamed as its predecessor in 1949.

The original &quot;Cementerio Viejo&quot; of Parque Patricios would be reopened in 1880 to bury the dead of Combate de los Corrales, a fight for Buenos Aires that took place on 22 June. In 1897 it was transformed into a public park, being today the &quot;Parque Florentino Ameghino&quot;.

=== British and German Cemeteries ===
In the 19th century a large number of Britons came to Argentina to work in the many areas of the economy in which England then had extensive interests. At first the British Cemetery was founded beside the Socorro Chapel (started 1821 - authorized on 22 February 1822). In 1833 the cemetery had to move to what was then called Victoria Cemetery (today the &quot;Plaza 1° de Mayo&quot;) until November, 1892, when they were asked by the Municipality to move. 

Section 16 of the Chacarita Cemetery was given in exchange for the Victoria Cemetery. Eventually in 1913 the Cementerio Británico () (or so called &quot;De Disidentes or Corporación del Cementerio Británico de Bs. As.&quot;) was divided into the German and the British cemeteries as we know them today, because the two local communities had grown since the beginning of the 19th century.

The British Cemetery and the German Cemetery are today not managed by or part of Chacarita Cemetery.

<text>The GR 20 (or &quot;fra li monti&quot;) is a GR footpath that crosses the Mediterranean island of Corsica running approximately north–south, described by the outdoor writer Paddy Dillon as &quot;one of the top trails in the world&quot;.
The whole trail is about 180 km long with 12,000 m of elevation gain, and is clearly waymarked throughout. Every year, approximately 10,000 to 20,000 hikers walk along the trail, typically completing it in about 15 days. The trail is considered to be the most difficult of all the GR routes and consists of two parts: the northern part, between Calenzana and Vizzavona and the southern part, between Vizzavona and Conca.

Vizzavona is regarded as the midpoint due to the presence of a train station, making it a convenient starting or ending point for hikers covering only one part the route. From Vizzavona, the train can be taken to Bastia or Ajaccio as well as many smaller towns and villages such as Corte. The northern part is considered by some the more difficult part because of the steep and rocky paths, though this could be an effect of many walkers beginning in the north and not being as fit for this section. The southern part of the trail is often considered easier though the lower altitude may give rise to higher temperatures in summer and so provide more difficult walking conditions.

Along the trail there are mountain huts known as &quot;refuges&quot; or gîtes. The standard and price of accommodations and food varies between refuges. Hikers can sleep in a tent near the refuge, but it is not permitted to pitch tents along the trail.

The GR 20 is an advanced trail. Other less difficult trails on the island include the Mare e monti (sea and mountains) and the Mare a mare (from sea to sea) trails.

The idea of GR 20 comes from a former general inspector for youth and sports, Marcel Schlück, and his friend Guy Degos, both hiking enthusiasts.

==Route==
* Northern part: Calenzana – Ortu di Piobbu or Bonifatu (alternative route) – Carozzu – Asco Stagnu – Tighjettu – Ciottulu di I Mori (or Castel de Vergio) – Manganu – Petra Piana – L&#x27;Onda – Vizzavona
* Southern part: Vizzavona – E Capenelle – I Prati – Usciulu – Matalza (added in the late 2011) – Asinao – I Paliri – Conca

==Records==
Men&#x27;s

In June 2016, François D&#x27;Haene set a time of 31 hours and 6 minutes. In 2021 this was broken by Lambert Santelli with a time of 30 hours 25 minutes.

Women&#x27;s

The current record by a woman is held by Anne-Lise Rousset who completed the course in 35 hours and 50 minutes in June 2022.

<text>Hiram Bingham III (November 19, 1875 – June 6, 1956) was an American academic, explorer and politician. In 1911, he publicized the existence of the Inca citadel of Machu Picchu which he rediscovered with the guidance of local indigenous farmers. Later, Bingham served as the 69th Governor of Connecticut for a single day in 1925—the shortest term in history. He had been elected in 1924 as governor, but was also elected to the Senate and chose that position. He served as a member of the United States Senate until 1933.

==Early life and early academic career==
Bingham was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, the son of Clara Brewster and Hiram Bingham II (1831–1908), an early Protestant missionary to the Kingdom of Hawai&#x27;i. He was also the grandson of Hiram Bingham I (1789–1869) and Sybil Moseley Bingham (1792–1848), earlier missionaries. Through his mother&#x27;s side he was a descendant of William Brewster, a Mayflower passenger. He attended O&#x27;ahu College, now known as Punahou School, from 1882 to 1892.

Bingham went to the United States in his teens in order to undertake higher education, entering Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, from which he graduated in 1894. He earned a B.A. degree from Yale College in 1898, a degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 1900, where he took one of the first courses in Latin American history offered in the United States, and a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1905. Since Harvard at the time did not have a specialist in Latin American history, Edward Gaylord Bourne of Yale served as the examiner for Bingham&#x27;s qualifying exams. While at Yale, Bingham was a member of Acacia fraternity.

In his first academic position, he taught history and politics at Harvard. He next served as preceptor (teacher) under Woodrow Wilson at Princeton University. Princeton &quot;did not much favor Latin American history.&quot; But in 1907, when Yale sought a replacement for Bourne, who had died an early death, it appointed Bingham as a lecturer in South American history. He became one of the pioneers in the U.S. of teaching and research on Latin American history. In 1908, he published an assessment of the field&#x27;s prospects, &quot;The Possibilities of South American History and Politics as a Field for Research,&quot; in which he surveyed library and archival resources in the U.S. as well as in South America. From 1924, he was a member of the Acorn Club.

==Explorer==
Bingham was not a trained archaeologist. But while he served at Yale as a lecturer and professor in South American history at Yale, he journeyed to South America and rediscovered the largely forgotten Inca city of Machu Picchu. In 1908 he had served as a delegate to the First Pan American Scientific Congress at Santiago, Chile. On his way home via Peru, a local prefect convinced him to visit the pre-Columbian city of Choquequirao. Bingham published an account of this trip in &quot;Across South America; an account of a journey from Buenos Aires to Lima by way of Potosí, with notes on Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru&quot; (1911).

Bingham was thrilled by the prospect of unexplored Inca cities, and organized the 1911 Yale Peruvian Expedition, one of the objectives of which was to search for the last capital of the Incas. Guided by locals, he rediscovered and correctly identified both Vitcos (then called Rosaspata) and Vilcabamba (then called Espíritu Pampa), which he named &quot;Eromboni Pampa&quot;. He did not correctly recognize Vilcabamba as the last capital, instead continuing onward and misidentifying Machu Picchu as the &quot;Lost City of the Incas&quot;. Decades later, Bingham&#x27;s oversight was rectified by the Andean explorer Vince Lee, whose detailed researches proved that Vilcabamba was indeed the Incas&#x27; last capital.

On July 24, 1911, Melchor Arteaga led Bingham to Machu Picchu, which had been largely forgotten by everybody except the small number of people living in the immediately neighboring valley. In addition, Cusco explorers Enrique Palma, Gabino Sanchez, and Agustín Lizárraga are said to have reached the site in 1901. Two local missionaries, Thomas Payne and Stuart McNairn, are credited by descendants with having climbed to the ruins in 1906.

Bingham returned to Peru in 1912, 1914, and 1915 with the support of Yale and the National Geographic Society. In &quot;Lost City of the Incas&quot; (1948), Bingham related how he came to believe that Machu Picchu housed a major religious shrine and served as a training center for religious leaders. Modern archaeological research has since determined that the site was not a religious center but a royal estate to which Inca leaders and their entourage repaired during the Andean summer.

A key element of the expeditions&#x27; legacy are the collections of exotic animals, antiquities, and human skeletal remains. These objects introduced the modern world to a new view of ancient Peru and allowed 20th-century interpreters to interpret Machu Picchu as a &quot;lost city&quot; that Bingham &quot;scientifically discovered&quot;. Bingham merged his reliance on prospecting by local huaqueros with the notion that science had a sovereign claim on all artifacts that might contribute to the accumulation of knowledge.

Machu Picchu has become one of the major tourist attractions in South America. Bingham is recognized as the man who brought the site to world attention, although many others helped. The switchback-filled road that carries tourist buses to the site from the Urubamba River is called Carretera Hiram Bingham (the Hiram Bingham Highway).

Bingham&#x27;s book &quot;Lost City of the Incas&quot; became a bestseller upon its publication in 1948.

Bingham has been cited as a possible inspiration for the film character Harry Steele, played by Charlton Heston in the 1954 film &quot;Secret of the Incas&quot;, which is about a fictional archaeological dig at Machu Picchu, and shot on location. The Steele character, and some scenarios in that film, subsequently inspired the film character Indiana Jones, and the &#x27;Map room&#x27; scenario in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;.

Peru has long sought the return of the estimated 40,000 artifacts, including mummies, ceramics, and bones, that Bingham excavated and exported from Machu Picchu. He had been given permission through a decree by the Peruvian government. Peru had since argued that the objects were only loaned to Yale, not given. On September 14, 2007, an agreement was made between Yale University and the Peruvian government for the objects&#x27; return. On April 12, 2008, the Peruvian government said it had revised previous estimates of 4,000 pieces up to 40,000. In 2012 Yale University began returning thousands of these objects to Peru.

Bingham was a member of The Explorers Club.

==Prior discoverers of Machu Picchu==
An 1874 map shows the site of Machu Picchu. Soon after Bingham announced the existence of Machu Picchu, others came forward claiming to have seen the city first, such as British missionary Thomas Payne and German engineer named J. M. von Hassel. Recent discoveries have put forth a new claimant, a German named who bought land opposite the Machu Picchu mountain in the 1860s and tried to raise money from investors to plunder nearby Incan ruins.
In 1911, Bingham found the name Agustín Lizárraga and the date 1902 written in charcoal on one of the walls of the Temple of the Three Windows. Initially disappointed, he documented in his journal: &quot;Agustín Lizárraga is discoverer of Machu Picchu and lives at San Miguel Bridge just before passing&quot;.

Prior to the 19th and 20th centuries at least one conquistador, Baltasar de Ocampo, was known to have visited the site in the late 16th century. Ocampo left detailed notes on the richly carved and finely dressed stone lintels, among other notable features of the mountaintop palace.

==Marriage and family==
Bingham married Alfreda Mitchell, granddaughter of Charles L. Tiffany and his wife, on November 20, 1900. They had seven sons together: Woodbridge (1901–1986) (professor), Hiram Bingham IV (1903–1988) (diplomat and World War II hero), Alfred Mitchell Bingham (1905–1998) (lawyer and author), Charles Tiffany (1906–1993) (physician), Brewster (1908–1995) (minister), Mitchell (1910–1994) (artist), and Jonathan Brewster Bingham (1914–1986) (Democratic Congressman).

After a divorce he married Suzanne Carroll Hill in June 1937. His former wife, Alfreda Mitchell, married pianist Henry Gregor in August 1937.

In 1982 Temple University Press published Char Miller&#x27;s doctoral dissertation on the Bingham family titled &quot;Fathers and sons: The Bingham family and the American mission.&quot;

==Military==
Bingham achieved the rank of captain of the Connecticut National Guard in 1916. In 1917, he became an aviator and organized the United States Schools of Military Aeronautics at eight universities to provide ground school training for aviation cadets. He served the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps and the Air Service, attaining the rank of lieutenant colonel. In Issoudun, France, Bingham commanded the Third Aviation Instruction Center, the Air Service&#x27;s largest primary instruction and pursuit training school. He became a supporter of the Air Service in their post-war quest for independence from the Army and supported that effort, in part, with the publication of his wartime experiences titled, &quot;An Explorer in the Air Service&quot; published in 1920 by Yale University Press.

==Politics==

In 1922, Bingham was elected lieutenant governor of Connecticut, an office he held until 1924. In November 1924, he was elected governor.

On December 16, 1924, Bingham was also elected as a Republican to serve in the United States Senate to fill a vacancy created by the suicide of Frank Bosworth Brandegee. Bingham defeated noted educator Hamilton Holt by a handy margin. Now both governor-elect and senator-elect, Bingham served as governor for one day (January 7–8, 1925), the shortest term of any Connecticut governor, before resigning to take his Senate seat.

Bingham was reelected to a full six-year Senate term in 1926.

He was Chairman of the Committee on Printing and then Chairman of the Committee on Territories and Insular Possessions. President Calvin Coolidge appointed Bingham to the President&#x27;s Aircraft Board during his first term in the Senate; the press quickly dubbed the ex-explorer &quot;The Flying Senator&quot;.

Bingham failed in his second reelection effort in the wake of the 1932 Democratic landslide following the start of the Great Depression. He left the Senate at the end of his second term in 1933.

During World War II, Bingham lectured at several United States Navy training schools. In 1951 he was appointed Chairman of the Civil Service Commission Loyalty Review Board, an assignment he kept through 1953.

===Censure in the Senate===

The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee investigated an arrangement between Bingham, his clerk, and a lobbyist who agreed to pass information on to Bingham&#x27;s office after executing a plan that was irregular &quot;even by the standards of his day.&quot; Bingham took his clerk off duty, and paid his salary to the lobbyist, thus allowing him to attend as a Senate staffer to closed meetings of the Finance Committee&#x27;s deliberations on tariff legislation.

The Judiciary Subcommittee initially condemned Bingham&#x27;s scheme but recommended no formal Senate action. Subsequently, Bingham decided to label the subcommittee&#x27;s inquiry a partisan witch hunt, provoking further Senate interest. Eventually the Senate passed a resolution of censure on November 4, 1929, by a vote of 54 to 22.

==Death==
On June 6, 1956, Bingham died at his Washington, D.C., home. He is interred at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.

<text>The Farnborough International Airshow is a trade exhibition for the aerospace and defence industries, where civilian and military aircraft are demonstrated to potential customers and investors in Farnborough, Hampshire. Since its first show in 1948, Farnborough has seen the debut of many famous aeroplanes, including the Vickers VC10, Concorde, the Eurofighter, the Airbus A380, and the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II. At the 1958 show, Hawker Hunters of the RAF&#x27;s Black Arrows executed a 22-aircraft formation loop, setting a new world record.

The international trade show runs for five days. Until 2020, the show ran for a full week with the first five days reserved for trade visitors and the general public attending on the weekend.

==Status==
The Farnborough International Airshow is the second-largest show of its kind after the Paris Air Show. 

The event is held in mid-July in even-numbered years at Farnborough International Exhibition &amp; Conference Centre in Hampshire, United Kingdom. Flying occurs on all five days, and there are also static displays of aircraft outside and booths and stands in the indoor exhibition halls. The airshow alternates with the Paris Air Show, which is held in odd-numbered years and has a similar format, and is held in the same years as the Berlin Air Show. It is organised by Farnborough International Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the ADS Group. In 2012, it attracted 109,000 trade visitors over the first five days, and 100,000 public visitors during the weekend. Orders and commitments for 758 aircraft were announced, worth US$72 billion.

==History==
The Society of British Aircraft Constructors held its first flying and static display at Hendon Aerodrome in June 1932. An invitation only flying display was held on 27 June 1932 and some of the aircraft were on static display in the &quot;new aircraft park&quot; during the previous weekend when the Royal Air Force pageant was held.

For the sixth annual display in 1938 the event moved to the nearby de Havilland airfield at Hatfield, the last before the Second World War.

The show recommenced in 1946 at Handley Page works at Radlett in north London until 1947.
In 1948, it moved to the Royal Aircraft Establishment field at Farnborough, Hampshire.

===1940s===

The inaugural show took place on the first week of September 1948 and all of the static aircraft and supporting display stands were concentrated in the NE corner of the airfield with &#x27;A-Shed&#x27; as the main &#x27;West Exhibition Hall&#x27; and the soon-to-be famous &#x27;Black Sheds&#x27; housing a smaller &#x27;East Exhibition Hall&#x27; and refreshments for guests on trade days and the public at the weekend. Among the many aircraft on display were the Armstrong Whitworth A.W.52 jet-powered flying wing and the prototype Vickers Viscount airliner.
The de Havilland Comet jet airliner was shown in 1949.
In 1950 the huge Bristol Brabazon airliner made its debut, powered by coupled Bristol Centaurus piston engines before the Bristol Proteus turboprops for longer ranges like London-New York nonstop.
A modified Vickers Viscount was shown with Rolls-Royce Tay turbojets in a configuration mimicked later by the Boeing 737.

===1950s===


In 1952, the futuristic Avro Vulcan delta bomber was displayed a few days after its first flight, along with the giant Saunders-Roe Princess double-decker flying boat powered by ten Proteus turboprops, one month after its maiden flight, but a de Havilland 110 disintegrated and crashed into the spectator area, killing 29 and its two crew.
In 1958, the Fairey Rotodyne was the star attraction, with its &quot;tip-jet&quot; powered rotors, transitioning from a helicopter vertical takeoff and hover to autogiro flight, exceeding helicopter speeds.

===1960s===
In 1962, the last time the show was held annually, the Hawker P.1127, the VTOL precursor to the Harrier jump jet, made its debut, along with the corporate de Havilland DH.125 Jet Dragon, and the de Havilland Comet 4C, de Havilland Trident, BAC 1-11 and Vickers VC10 airliners.
From 1966, foreign aircraft were allowed if they had British major components, such as the Rolls-Royce-powered Aermacchi MB-326 trainer and Fokker F27 turboprop airliner. Also, the Red Arrows, the RAF aerobatic display team, debuted their Hawker Siddeley Gnats.

===1970s===
In 1970, Concorde was shown after it had begun flight-testing the year before.
The double-delta Saab Viggen debuted in 1972 along with the Lockheed TriStar trijet widebody, powered by Rolls-Royce RB211s, in national British carrier BEA colours.
The Mach 3 Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, and the C-5 Galaxy military airlifter, were shown in 1974. In 1978, the CASA C-101 was flown in the airshow after flight-testing earlier that same year.

===1980s===
In 1982, the civil aviation transatlantic rivalry was exemplified by the European Airbus A310 against the American Boeing 767 widebody twinjets, along with its narrowbody sibling, the Boeing 757, while the Rockwell B-1 large swing-wing bomber was the main military interest.
In 1984, to demonstrate its short landing capability, a de Havilland Canada Buffalo made a steep descent but hit the runway, collapsed its landing gear and broke its main wing spar without a tragic outcome. 
At the 1986 show were demonstrated the BAe EAP, the Eurofighter predecessor, and Dassault Rafale rival fighters, as an A300 fly-by-wire testbed flying at very high angles of attack showing the wind-shear stall protection capabilities, later equipping the A320.
In 1988, the GE36 propfan-powered McDonnell Douglas MD-80 was demonstrated as a precursor for the MD-94X but propfan airliners remain elusive, while the Soviet Union brought the giant Antonov An-124 Ruslan airlifter and two MiG-29 fighters.

===1990s===

The Eurofighter made its debut in 1996 in an air display showing its airborne capabilities. The Antonov An-225 Mriya also took flight in 1990.

===2000s===
The biggest passenger aircraft to ever appear at Farnborough, the Airbus A380 debuted with a flypast in 2006 while in the midst of its flight-test programme.

===2010s===

In 2012, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner from Qatar Airways was in flying display, after a Boeing absence for 13 air shows.
The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II made its show debut in 2016, two years later than planned, with UK&#x27;s first F-35B and two US Marine Corps examples.
In 2018, the UK Ministry of Defence unveiled a full-scale Tempest model for its Future Combat Air strategy, as the Mitsubishi MRJ regional jet made its first flying display.

==== End of the Public Show ====
In March 2019 it was announced that the public flying days at the airshow would not continue. &quot;Negative and vitriolic feedback&quot; following the 2018 airshow, falling visitor numbers and tighter regulations introduced in the wake of the crash at Shoreham – which made it impossible for exhibitors such as the Red Arrows to perform aerobatics close to populated areas – were given as factors that contributed towards the decision. Farnborough would be a five-day trade show, with public admittance on the Friday only.

===2020s===
The 2020 Farnborough Airshow was to take place on 20 to 24 July 2020, but it was cancelled for the first time in its 72-year history because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Accidents == 
On 6 September 1952, a DH.110 jet fighter disintegrated in flight and 
crashed into the airshow audience, killing 29 spectators and its pilot John Derry and navigator Tony Richards. The worst airshow accident in the UK, it led to new safety procedures at British air displays.

On 13 September 1964, a Bristol Bulldog &quot;G-ABBB&quot;, marked (incorrectly) as &quot;K2227&quot; and owned by the Shuttleworth Trust, crashed while performing a loop. The pilot was only slightly hurt.

On 20 September 1968, a French Air Force Breguet Atlantic crashed into the offices of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) while performing a display at the air show. One of the RAE&#x27;s civilian maintenance staff was killed, as were all five members of the crew.

On 11 September 1970, a Wallis WA-117 autogyro &quot;G-AXAR&quot; crashed, killing the pilot, J.W.C. Judge.

On 1 September 1974, the Sikorsky S-67 Blackhawk helicopter prototype crashed on the runway after a low roll, killing both crew.

On 4 September 1984 a de Havilland Canada DHC-5D Buffalo crashed on the runway, with no casualties, after a badly judged steep approach to an intended short landing in a gusting crosswind.

<text>Life After God is a collection of short stories by Douglas Coupland, published in 1994. The stories are set around a theme of a generation raised without religion. The jacket for the hardcover book reads &quot;You are the first generation to be raised without religion.&quot; The text is an exploration of faith in this vacuum of religion. The stories are also illustrated by the author. Several critics have suggested that this publication marks an early shift in the stylistic vocabulary of Coupland and, according to one critic, he was &quot;excoriated presumably for attempting be serious and to express depression and spiritual yearning when his reviewers were expecting more postmodern jollity&quot;. However, the short story would later come to garner more praise (see below) though critics and academics have paid little attention to the publication in terms of academics&#x27; articles and commentary.

==Stories==
These are the stories that appear in the book, in the order of appearance:
(Note: All stories are told in the first person)

===Little Creatures===
This initial story chronicles a somewhat gloomy road trip a father takes with his child in order to pay a visit to the child’s grandfather in Prince George, British Columbia. A contemplation of life’s adversities and a pending divorce, the short story features the two characters’ parallel narratives of development in which both father and the child are at frail and liminal points in their lives. Thematically, the story touches upon the almost classic theme of an adult prematurely exposing a child to the harsh realities of life – in this story being alcoholism and the bitterness of a divorce, as one critic has noted.

===My Hotel Year===
This story is told in two parts. The story is told by a lonely person living in a hotel, and his interactions with some of the others that live in the hotel. In the first part, &quot;Cathy&quot;, the narrator analyzes his relationship with his neighbours, Cathy and Pup-Tent, as well as his relationship to Cathy. The second part, &quot;Donny&quot;, tells the tale of the narrator&#x27;s relationship with Donny, a hustler, who lives a very dangerous lifestyle. A frequent stabbing victim, Donny lives for the thrill of the dangerous lifestyle. He does not seem to care about his well being, but still values his life.

===Things That Fly===
The narrator of this story is a lonely man, who pays a visit to his parents’ house. While there, he finds himself watching television. He sees a report about how they are planning to kill off Superman. This news leaves the narrator heartbroken. The narrator contemplates the ability to fly and what it will mean if the one truly good person in the world is gone.

===The Wrong Sun===
Another story told in two parts. The first part, &quot;Thinking of the Sun&quot;, is apocalyptic. Nuclear episodes and war cause a cataclysm that ends the world. These episodes are the only non-fiction in the book and come from Coupland&#x27;s own life. Flashes of light replace the sun, and those who are alive to see it are reminded of their delicate existence. The second part, &quot;The Dead Speak&quot;, is a collective letter from those who died in this nuclear war. It gives revelations of their last moments on earth. It also relays the message that the living should move on, as the dead are in a new place and have changed souls.

===Gettysburg===
A letter from a father to a daughter, this story is a tale of the father&#x27;s love. The father tells the daughter about his honeymoon, her conception, and he contemplates on the major life changes taking place in his life. It is a story about love in the religious vacuum.

===In The Desert===
Dedicated to Michael Stipe from R.E.M., this is the story of the narrator&#x27;s trip through the desert. He is alone, but not lonely, even on his birthday. The narrator has experienced the deepest depth of loneliness. He stole syringes and steroids, to deliver to a celebrity trainer. The story is a road story, told as the character travels down Interstate 15, and the journey does not quite go as planned. A chance encounter with a desert man changes his outlook on life.

===Patty Hearst===
The female narrator of this story wonders about her life and the sequence of events that make it up. She first tells a story of a dog that died of a broken heart after its owner&#x27;s death. The story itself follows the narrator&#x27;s trip to possibly find her sister, Laurie, who ran away from home while the main narrator was still young. Laurie had become a drug addict. She explores the feeling of loneliness throughout the tales.

===1,000 Years (Life After God)===
1,000 Years is the tale of a group of childhood friends. It is the longest story in the book. It is narrated by a character named Scout. The story illustrates where each character&#x27;s life takes them, and their individual searches for meaning. Scout moves away from society, and into the wilderness. He is searching for meaning, or religion, or a connection to God. One researcher has noted that the characters in this story hold &quot;a tacit resentment against the parent generation for&quot; the neglect of not having instilled in them a measure of faith and that this &quot;story in particular, can be read as thematizing the young generation&#x27;s quest for an alternative narrative of faith.&quot;

==Inspiration==
After &quot;Shampoo Planet&quot;, Coupland began to look for a low tech topic for his next novel. He began to study the Great Famine of Ireland of 1845–1847. While researching this, short stories &quot;started popping out of [him]&quot;. Coupland’s religious life as a child was non-existent. He was raised as a blank slate, with no religious influence from his parents. He did not celebrate religious holidays such as Christmas or Easter.

&quot;Life After God&quot; is one expression of this pursuit.

==History of the novel==
While researching the Great Famine, Coupland crafted multiple short stories, complete with images drawn by the author. He then took these short stories, and bound them into individual small books at a copy center. Coupland then gave them out as presents to friends. They were not initially meant to form a complete novel. &quot;I had no idea they&#x27;d become a book-book until near the end&quot; (&quot;USA Today&quot;, 1994).

The original book jacket for the hard cover carried the message &quot;You are the first generation to be raised without religion.&quot; It also carried the message &quot;Please remove cover jacket flap before reading&quot;. This is because Coupland found the original cover to be a distraction from the text itself: &quot;So the book won&#x27;t be judged by its cover, and so readers will be aware that they are holding this oddly retro little zero-tech paper-and-word object called a book.&quot; (&quot;USA Today&quot;, 1994). As well, the story &quot;In the Desert&quot; is dedicated to Michael Stipe from R.E.M.

The book was initially met with very mixed reviews. Most critics compared the book to &quot;Generation X&quot; and &quot;Shampoo Planet&quot; and found that it was not in the same vein; Coupland’s first two novels defined generations, while &quot;Life After God&quot; was much more introspective. This left critics wanting. Others saw the text&#x27;s departure from the earlier work a virtue, and praised the text for being &quot;sincere&quot; instead of purely &quot;ironic&quot;. Generally, the text was received by critics very negatively.

Throughout the life of the book, however, the popularity of the text has dramatically increased in both respectability and popularity. In reviews for texts such as &quot;Hey Nostradamus!&quot; and &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, the text has been referenced as one of the best of Coupland’s career. The book has also had an effect in other creative fields. The Ataris have recorded a song based upon &quot;My Hotel Year&quot; with lyrics directly from the story. The anime Ergo Proxy has also named the 18th episode after the title of the text.
The book also enjoys a life in the academic world. It has been taught at major universities, such as Simon Fraser University. It has also been written upon in the academic study of Coupland’s work, &quot;Contemporary American and Canadian Novelists: Douglas Coupland&quot; by Andrew Tate from Manchester University.

<text>WKRG-TV (channel 5) is a television station licensed to Mobile, Alabama, United States, serving southwest Alabama and northwest Florida as an affiliate of CBS. It is owned by Nexstar Media Group alongside Gulf Shores, Alabama–licensed CW owned-and-operated station WFNA (channel 55). The two stations share studios with several radio stations owned by iHeartMedia on Broadcast Drive in southwest Mobile; WKRG-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located in unincorporated Baldwin County near Spanish Fort, Alabama.

==History==
WKRG-TV first signed on the air September 5, 1955. The station was founded by the architect and movie theater owner Kenneth R. Giddens, who also put WKRG radio (710 AM, now WNTM, and 99.9 FM, now WMXC) on the air. Owing to the radio station&#x27;s ties with the CBS Radio Network, WKRG-TV has served as the market&#x27;s CBS affiliate from its sign-on. It is the only commercial station in the market that has never changed its primary affiliation. WKRG-TV originally operated from studios located on St. Louis Street in downtown Mobile until around 1982, when it relocated its operations to an area near the Bel Air Mall, which Giddens also had a hand in developing. The TV station operates on the bottom floor while the radio stations operate on the second and third floors of the building.

Giddens originally had a 20% stake in WKRG-TV, and the other stakes were held by local businesses and colleges. On April 4, 1958, Giddens sold 50% of the station to &quot;Mobile Press-Register&quot;, Inc. He regained full control of the station in 1966.

For years, WKRG-TV was the only locally owned station in the Mobile–Pensacola–Pascagoula area. This changed after the death of Giddens in 1993. The radio stations were sold off in 1994, although they remain housed in the same building as the television station. Spartan Communications purchased WKRG-TV in 1998; the station then came under the ownership of Media General after it purchased Spartan in 2000. The station celebrated its 60th year of broadcasting in 2015.

In 2007, WKRG entered into a radio partnership with Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia), in effect re-establishing ties with former sister stations WNTM and WMXC, as well as WKSJ-FM (94.9 FM) and WRKH (96.1 FM). The radio stations were previously partnered with NBC affiliate WPMI-TV (channel 15), an association that ended as a result of Clear Channel selling its television stations (including WPMI) to Newport Television in 2008.

Between the early 1980s and 2012, WKRG served as the default CBS affiliate for the eastern half of the Pascagoula–Biloxi, Mississippi market as that market did not have a CBS affiliate of its own; WKRG was available to cable subscribers in Biloxi and Gulfport, Mississippi, and usually serves the area&#x27;s &quot;B&quot; CBS station behind New Orleans affiliate WWL-TV. This changed in 2012, when ABC affiliate WLOX signed an affiliation agreement to carry CBS programming on one of its digital subchannels.

On March 21, 2014, LIN Media entered into an agreement to merge with Media General in a $1.6 billion deal. Because LIN had already owned Fox affiliate WALA-TV and CW affiliate WFNA (channel 55), and WKRG and WALA rank among the four highest-rated stations in the Mobile–Pensacola market in total day viewership, the companies were required to sell either WKRG or WALA to another station owner in order to comply with FCC ownership rules as well as planned changes to those rules regarding same-market television stations which would prohibit sharing agreements. On August 20, 2014, Media General announced that it would keep WKRG and WFNA, and sell WALA to Meredith Corporation.

On September 8, 2015, less than nine months after the previous purchase was approved and finalized, Media General announced that it would acquire the Meredith Corporation for $2.4 billion, with the combined group to be renamed Meredith Media General if the sale had been finalized. Because Meredith recently acquired WALA as a required divestment from the LIN Media acquisition, and the two stations continue to rank among the four highest-rated stations in the Mobile–Pensacola market in total day viewership, the companies would once again have been required to sell either WKRG or WALA to comply with FCC ownership rules as well as recent changes to those rules regarding same-market television stations that restrict sharing agreements; sister station WFNA could have legally been acquired by Meredith Media General either by maintaining its new duopoly with WKRG or reuniting it with WALA, as its total day viewership ranks below the top-four ratings threshold. However, on January 27, 2016, Nexstar Broadcasting Group announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire Media General, resulting in the termination of Meredith&#x27;s acquisition by Media General. The merger with Nexstar reunited WKRG with Panama City sister station WMBB, which was sold by Media General in 2008 to Hoak Media and eventually was acquired by Nexstar after Hoak merged with Gray Television, the owner of its closest competitor, which required its sale.

==Programming==
Shows that aired on WKRG in the past include &quot;Woman&#x27;s World&quot;, &quot;The Popeye Show&quot;, &quot;Rosie&#x27;s Place&quot; and &quot;Small Fry News&quot;, a show featuring local fifth graders. WKRG-TV was also the longtime home of &quot;Congressional Report&quot; from 1973 to 2006, billed as the longest-running program of its kind in the nation, featuring local members of Congress giving viewers a local perspective of Washington, D.C., and the central Gulf Coast from their standpoint.

===News operation===

WKRG-TV presently broadcasts hours of local newscasts each week (with hours each weekday, two hours on Saturdays and three hours on Sundays).

In 2002, the focus of the station&#x27;s programming switched to weather and news, and the station&#x27;s branding was changed to reflect it: it rebranded from &quot;WKRG 5&quot; to &quot;WKRG News 5&quot; (based on the station&#x27;s &quot;NewsCenter&quot; branding in the 1980s and 1990s) and its slogan touted it as Mobile&#x27;s &quot;Weather Authority&quot;. On October 18, 2010, starting with its 6 p.m. newscast, WKRG became the second television station in the Mobile–Pensacola market and the first Mobile-based station to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition.

At one time, WKRG ran an expanded morning newscast until 8 a.m. on weekdays, which preempted the first hour of &quot;The Early Show&quot;, as well as a weekday 9 a.m. newscast. The 7 a.m. newscast was canceled in 2008 at CBS&#x27; request for its affiliates to air both hours of &quot;The Early Show&quot; and the 9 a.m. newscast was canceled in 2009 due to low viewership and staff reductions by parent company Media General. This newscast returned to the 9 a.m. slot on March 30, 2015, as a half-hour newscast on weekdays. Future newscast expansion has been touted by the station by way of news promos.

WKRG is one of the two remaining stations in the market to start their daily morning newscast at 5 a.m., along with WPMI, which ran a 4:30 a.m. show from September 2013 to June 2015.

On April 20, 2015, the morning newscast began to be simulcast on WFNA, mainly as a stopgap solution due to the sudden cancellation of that station&#x27;s syndicated morning show, &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot;.

WKRG became the first Mobile station (second in market overall) to launch weekend morning newscasts on June 20, 2015, from 5 to 6 a.m. Saturdays and 6 to 8 a.m. Sundays.

On December 5, 2016, WKRG added newscasts at 4:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. The latter replaced &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, which moved to sister station WFNA to weeknights at 9:30 following their 9 p.m. news which is also produced by WKRG.

On September 7, 2017, a video of WKRG meteorologist Alan Sealls covering Hurricane Irma, Hurricane Jose, and Hurricane Katia went viral on Reddit and YouTube.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

WKRG replaced the Retro Television Network with MeTV on its third digital subchannel in September 2011.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WKRG-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 5, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 27, using virtual channel 5.

<text>Farnborough Airport (previously called: TAG Farnborough Airport, RAE Farnborough, ICAO Code EGLF) is an operational business/executive general aviation airport in Farnborough, Rushmoor, Hampshire, England. The airport covers about 8% of Rushmoor&#x27;s land area.

Farnborough Aerodrome has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P864) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (TAG Farnborough Airport Limited).

The first powered flight in the United Kingdom was at Farnborough on 16 October 1908, when Samuel Cody took off in his British Army Aeroplane No 1.

The airfield is the home of the Farnborough International Airshow which is held in even numbered years. It is also home to the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) and the southern office of Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB), both part of the Department for Transport.

== History ==
Farnborough Airport has a long history, beginning at the start of the 20th century with the creation of His Majesty&#x27;s Balloon Factory and the first powered flight in the United Kingdom in 1908. This subsequently became the Royal Aircraft Establishment, a connection which continues in the Farnborough Air Sciences Trust museum.

Farnborough airfield and RAE was bombed by Germany during the Second World War, on 13 August 1940 by a flight of Junkers Ju 88s.

The civil enclave was operated by Farnborough Business Aviation until 2003, when the Ministry of Defence stopped operations at Farnborough. All experimental aircraft were moved to MoD Boscombe Down; the airport was taken over by TAG Aviation. On 27 September 2019 TAG Farnborough Airport Ltd was acquired by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (Europe) Limited. It changed its name on 10 October 2019 to Farnborough Airport Ltd. Commercial defence research by research firm QinetiQ continues in the adjoining Cody Technology Park.

Farnborough Airfield appeared in the 2008 James Bond film &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;, as the Austrian airport from which Bond flies. The airfield was also a location for the 2010 film &quot;Inception&quot;.

==Units==
The following units were here at some point:


== Infrastructure ==
After TAG took control of the airport from the MOD, it invested in a series of new infrastructure projects, including a new radar unit and a resurfaced runway. The most striking new constructions were a new control tower, a large hangar unit, and finally a brand new terminal building that opened in 2006, all designed by Reid Architecture and Buro Happold. The designs won a series of awards, and were nominated for Building of the Year by &quot;Building&quot; magazine in 2007. The terminal was formally opened by Prince Andrew.

== Operations ==
Activity at the airport has grown from a low level in 1989 to around 30,000 movements in 2018. The airport is home to a number of the UK&#x27;s largest business jet companies, including Gama Aviation, Executive Jet Charter and Bookajet.

Farnborough Airport sees the bulk of its traffic from conventional business jets. The airport is also popular with operators of larger aircraft, such as the Boeing BBJ and Airbus A319CJ; however, the use of these types is heavily restricted, with nothing larger than a BBJ2 permitted except during the airshow.

The airport&#x27;s only scheduled services are private and are operated by BAE Systems, whose headquarters are next to the airport: it operates an Embraer 135 on a twice-daily shuttle service to Warton Aerodrome, Monday–Thursday, and a single Embraer 135 shuttle flight to Warton on Fridays. BAE also operates a Beechcraft King Air 200 to Walney Island. This service runs 1–4 times a day Monday–Friday.
Farnborough Airport was the operations base for Citelynx, now defunct.

The Air Accidents Investigation Branch has their head office in Farnborough House, located in a compound within Farnborough Airport. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch has their southern office on the same property, next to AAIB.

== Incidents and accidents ==
During the Farnborough Airshow on 6 September 1952 the prototype de Havilland DH.110 Sea Vixen crashed. Following a demonstration of its ability to break the sound barrier, the aircraft disintegrated, killing 31 people, including the crew of two: test pilot and record breaker John Derry and Tony Richards. This incident led to major changes to the safety regulations for air shows in the UK.

During the 4 September 1984 show, a de Havilland Canada DHC-5 Buffalo was destroyed when it struck Runway 25 during landing after a steep short-final descent while demonstrating its STOL capabilities to spectators and customers. The nose-gear collapsed, followed by failure of the wing spar on both sides near the fuselage, both propellers shedding blades and the wrecked aircraft skidding to a halt on the runway. The two crew and one passenger survived the crash; nobody else was injured. The accident was attributed to pilot error, with gusty wind conditions as a major factor.

== Opposition to airport expansion ==

The airport was originally restricted to 28,000 movements each year, of which no more than 2,500 were permitted at weekends. In October 2005, TAG applied to Rushmoor Borough Council to have the weekend limit raised. The application was initially refused, but allowed by the Government on appeal in March 2008 after a Public Inquiry. A further application for an increase in the overall limit to 50,000 movements per annum was refused by Rushmoor Borough Council in 2009 and an appeal against this refusal was heard in May 2010. In February 2011 the joint Secretaries of State decided to uphold the planning appeal and allow 50,000 annual movements, phased in until 2019. The neutrality of the government was questioned by the Green Party of England and Wales after Eric Pickles, local government minister, attended a lobbying dinner where TAG chief executive, Brandon O&#x27;Reilly was present.

Opposition to the business airport has been chronicled by Blackwater Environmental Justice, and Farnborough Aerodrome Residents Association (FARA) was formed by the local community to oppose the airport expansion.

The annual movement in 2010 were 23,511 and had risen to 23,944 by 2014. However, in February 2014 TAG Farnborough applied for controlled airspace to allow business jets to operate at lower levels as far as the South Downs to allow greater predictability for its clients. Opponents of this proposal state that a far larger number of other flights will then divert into a hazardous bottle-neck to the west, causing a serious risk of collisions, increased noise and increased emissions of carbon dioxide. The closing date for comments on TAG&#x27;s proposal was extended, after TAG failed to record and acknowledge anything for five days. The Civil Aviation Authority granted the controlled airspace in July 2018, though its implementation was delayed until 2020 by an unsuccessful application by Lasham Gliding Society for a judicial review. By 2018, total annual movements at the airport were 29,958.

== Aviation enthusiast scheme ==

To promote a closer working relationship with local aviation enthusiasts, Hampshire Police established an Aviation/Airport Watch Scheme. Originally run by the airport operator, this is now run under the auspices of Project Pegasus.

Membership does not give any additional rights compared to other members of the public, but facilitates frequent contact between the police and enthusiasts. The scheme has previously arranged visits for members to TAG Farnborough Airport, providing airside access and brief chats with representatives of TAG Aviation. It has also been able to provide viewing areas before, during and after the Farnborough Air Show to members.

<text>Aztec Camera were a Scottish pop/new wave band founded by Roddy Frame, the group&#x27;s singer, songwriter and only consistent member. Established in 1980, Aztec Camera released a total of six studio albums: &quot;High Land, Hard Rain&quot; (1983), &quot;Knife&quot; (1984), &quot;Love&quot; (1987), &quot;Stray&quot; (1990), &quot;Dreamland&quot; (1993) and &quot;Frestonia&quot; (1995). The band garnered popular success for the songs &quot;Oblivious&quot;, &quot;Somewhere in My Heart&quot; and &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; (a duet with former Clash guitarist Mick Jones).

==History==

===Early years (1980–1983)===

Aztec Camera were formed in East Kilbride in 1980 by Roddy Frame and drummer David Mulholland after they had left the punk-inspired band Neutral Blue. Aztec Camera first appeared on a Glasgow cassette-only compilation of local unsigned bands on the Pungent Records label, affiliated with the &quot;Fumes&quot; fanzine run by Danny Easson and John Gilhooly. The band&#x27;s first United Kingdom (UK) single release was sold in a 7&quot; format by Postcard Records—a Glasgow-based independent record label cofounded by Edwyn Collins and Alan Horne—in 1981. The single featured the song &quot;Just Like Gold&quot; and a B-side entitled &quot;We Could Send Letters&quot;; an acoustic version of the latter song appeared on a compilation album, entitled &quot;C81&quot;, that was released on cassette in 1981 through a partnership between &quot;NME&quot; magazine and Rough Trade Records. Frame, aged 16 years, met Collins for the first time during the Postcard period when the latter was 21 years old.

A second single, also released in 1981, featured the songs &quot;Mattress of Wire&quot; and &quot;Lost Outside the Tunnel&quot;. Following the two 7&quot; releases with Postcard, the group signed with Rough Trade Records in the UK and Sire Records in the United States (US) for their debut album. At this point, the band were officially a quartet: Roddy Frame (vocals, guitar, harmonica), Bernie Clark (piano, organ), Campbell Owens (bass) and Dave Ruffy (drums, percussion).

===&quot;High Land, Hard Rain&quot; and breakthrough (1983–1984)===
Aztec Camera&#x27;s debut album, &quot;High Land, Hard Rain&quot; was produced by John Brand and Bernie Clarke for the Rough Trade record label. The album was released in April 1983 and was distributed in different formats on Domino Recording Co. Ltd. in the US (in addition to Sire); WEA and Celluloid in France; Nuevos Medios in Spain; Powderworks in Australia; MVM Records in Portugal; and WEA for a general European release. The album was successful, garnering significant critical acclaim, and peaked at number 129 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Frame later revealed that the song &quot;Oblivious&quot; was consciously written as a &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;-type pop song and received a corresponding degree of popularity.

During the recording process for the album, Frame used a different guitar for every song. For the song &quot;Orchid Girl&quot;, Frame explained in 2013—during the 30th anniversary tour—that he was attempting to merge the influences of his favorite guitarist at the time, Wes Montgomery, and punk rock icon Joe Strummer. In a late 1990s television interview, Frame explained that a &quot;boy&quot; image was associated with him during this era, and that he was annoyed by it at the time. He was taking his music very seriously—&quot;you don&#x27;t want to be called &#x27;boy&#x27;; especially when you&#x27;re listening to Joy Division&quot;—but he eventually stopped caring about it.

===WEA Records and &quot;Knife&quot; (1984–1987)===
After &quot;High Land Hard Rain&quot;, Bernie Clarke left the band, and was replaced by Malcolm Ross on second guitar and backing vocals. Aztec Camera changed record labels once again for the release of their second album, &quot;Knife&quot;, which was released through WEA (Warner Music Group). Frame revealed in a May 2014 BBC radio interview that he was not informed of the ownership arrangements of the record deal, stating that he was unaware as an 18-year-old that the record company would own the rights to all of his corresponding recordings. After &quot;High Land, Hard Rain&quot;, Frame spent a significant amount of time living in New Orleans, United States (US), listening to Bob Dylan&#x27;s album &quot;Infidels&quot;. Upon reading that Dire Straits&#x27; guitarist and singer Mark Knopfler produced the album, Frame began writing songs based on a sound that he thought Knopfler could work with.

Frame signed the band to the WEA record label—at the time his manager was Rob Johnson—and secured Knopfler as the producer for Aztec Camera&#x27;s second album, &quot;Knife&quot;, which was released in 1984; Frame explained in 1988 that Knopfler was &quot;professional&quot; and efficient during the recording process. Frame&#x27;s experimental mindset in relation to music emerged on &quot;Knife&quot;, as the duration of the song is nearly nine minutes and synthesizers appear throughout the album. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, the band previewed a selection of songs as part of a performance for the BBC television show &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; and the song &quot;All I Need is Everything&quot; received radio airplay subsequent to release. In a 2007 interview alongside Collins, Frame explained further:
He&#x27;s [Knopfler] a great guitarist. Mark Knopfler&#x27;s recording techniques were great—you [Collins] would have liked him, &#x27;cos that was ... then, it was quite a thing. &#x27;Cos everyone was going digital, and going MIDI and all that, and his thing was all about using the right microphone. If you use the right microphone, then you don&#x27;t have to use too much EQ and all that stuff, and it was all about that. Yeah, I kinda liked that—the right mic[rophone], the right amp[lifier], the right kind of board and stuff.

===&quot;Love&quot; and line–up changes (1987–1990)===
At the time that the band&#x27;s third album &quot;Love&quot; (1987) was created, Frame was the only original member of the band involved with the project; &quot;Love&quot; and future Aztec Camera albums were written and recorded by Frame under the &quot;Aztec Camera&quot; moniker, and session musicians recorded with Frame on a track-by-track basis. Frame explained in August 2014 that he contemplated the conception of &quot;Love&quot; during a three-year hiatus following the release of &quot;Knife&quot;. Frame said that he moved even further away from the British &quot;indie ethic&quot; and was listening to the &quot;pop end of hip hop&quot;, including artists such as Jimmy Jam &amp; Terry Lewis, Cherrelle, the Force MDs and Alexander O&#x27;Neal. Frame wanted to make a record based on such influences and &quot;Working in a Goldmine&quot; was the first song to achieve this aspiration.

Frame relocated to the US to record the album—&quot;pretty much against the wishes of Warner Brothers&quot;, who were unsure of his decision-making at the time—and was primarily based in Boston, Massachusetts, and New York. Frame recorded with American session musicians, like Marcus Miller and David Franke, and explained that his audience was &quot;mystified&quot; by the transformation of the band, but he was &quot;too far gone&quot; to care and just wanted to do his &quot;own thing&quot; by that stage. Due to the significant change of musical direction, the album&#x27;s first three singles did not make a strong impression in the marketplace.

The &quot;Love&quot; album produced the popular song &quot;Somewhere in My Heart&quot;, recorded by Frame with dance, R&amp;B and pop producer Michael Jonzun in Boston. Frame said in 2014 that the song has been &quot;great&quot; for him, but at the time of creating the album, the song was not &quot;in keeping&quot; with the rest of &quot;Love&quot;. Frame revealed in a radio interview with the &quot;Soho Social&quot; program, presented by Dan Gray, that he considered &quot;Somewhere in My Heart&quot; an odd song and initially thought it would be best as a B-side. Frame concluded, &quot;I can&#x27;t pick them [the successful songs].&quot;

Frame was asked during a television interview, following the release of &quot;Love&quot;, about the new sound of the album, and he referenced artists like Anita Baker and Luther Vandross. When asked if the album could be labelled &quot;Middle of the road (MOR)&quot;, Frame replied: &quot;Call it what you like. I don&#x27;t really mind.&quot;

===&quot;Stray&quot; and &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; (1990–1993)===

For the band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Stray&quot;, Frame collaborated with the Clash&#x27;s Mick Jones on the song &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;, and Jones also toured with the band following the album&#x27;s release. Jones performed with Aztec Camera at the Glasgow Barrowlands and the Ibiza Festival in 1990. In a 1990 interview, recorded during a tour of Japan, Frame explained that he wrote &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; in 45 minutes after a two- to three-hour conversation with Jones in the canteen of a London rehearsal studio that both Big Audio Dynamite and Aztec Camera were using. In an August 2014 radio interview, Frame elaborated further, stating that at the time he wrote the song, Jones lived near his London home; Frame visited Jones after recording the song and said to the Clash guitarist, &quot;You&#x27;ll either sing on it, or you&#x27;ll want to sue me&quot;, as Frame believed the song was so similar to Jones&#x27; previous work.

===&quot;Dreamland&quot; (1993–1995)===
Frame then recorded the next Aztec Camera album, &quot;Dreamland&quot;, with Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto. Released in 1993, the album was mixed by Julian Mendelsohn, who had previously worked with the band. While mixing the album at Hook End Manor, an 18th-century red-brick building that had been converted into a studio in the Berkshire countryside of England, UK, Frame explained that he waited for a lengthy period of time to work with Sakamoto, due to the latter&#x27;s busy schedule. Frame finally met with Sakamoto in Ibiza and both eventually recorded the album in New York City, US over a four-week period. Frame&#x27;s interest in Sakamoto was elaborated upon in the same interview:
I liked what he did when he was in the Yellow Magic Orchestra, and I also liked that album where he plays the music from Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence on piano. That&#x27;s where you realise that the atmosphere around his compositions is actually in the writing – it&#x27;s got nothing to do with synthesisers.

Frame&#x27;s decision to ask Sakamoto was finalised after he saw his performance at the Japan Festival that was held in London, UK. During the recording process, Frame&#x27;s routine consisted of: working in the studio from the early afternoon until around 2am; a turkey sandwich at a deli off Times Square (&quot;because it was possible to get one at two in the morning, and for no other reason&quot;); a cab-ride back to the Mayflower Hotel, where he was staying; an hour of listening to Shabba Ranks; and then bed.

===&quot;Frestonia&quot; and disbandment (1995–present)===
For Frame&#x27;s final album under the Aztec Camera moniker, and the last original studio recording for the WEA label, Frame worked with renowned production team Langer-Winstanley, who had previously worked with Madness and Elvis Costello. &quot;Frestonia&quot; was released in 1995 and the Reprise Records label issued it in the US. &quot;Sun&quot; (1996) was the only one song from the album that was released as a single. After the release of &quot;Frestonia&quot;, Frame finally decided to record under his own name and was no longer a Warner artist. Three Aztec Camera &quot;Best of&quot; compilations were eventually released: &quot;The Best of Aztec Camera&quot; was released in 1999 by Warner.ESP, a division of the Warner corporation that specialised in compilations; in 2005, &quot;Deep and Wide and Tall&quot; was released by the Warner Strategic Marketing United Kingdom label as part of the Warner Platinum series; and &quot;Walk Out To Winter: The Best of Aztec Camera&quot;, a two-disc collection that was released by the Music Club Deluxe label in 2011.

Since the Stray Tour in 1990, Frame has merged a segment of the Bob Dylan song &quot;It&#x27;s Alright Ma (I&#x27;m Only Bleeding)&quot; into &quot;Down the Dip&quot;, from &quot;High Land, Hard Rain&quot;, and this version of the song was played by Frame at subsequent shows, up until October 2012. Around 2012, Frame included a segment of the Curtis Mayfield song &quot;People Get Ready&quot; in live solo versions of the song &quot;How Men Are&quot;, from the &quot;Love&quot; album. In October 2013, a book entitled &quot;The Lyrics: Roddy Frame&quot;—containing the entirety of Frame&#x27;s lyrical work with Aztec Camera—and a &quot;High Land, Hard Rain&quot; T-shirt were released as part of a &quot;Roddy Frame&quot; collection. 

All six Aztec Camera studio albums were reissued in August 2012 by the Edsel Records label, which had previously completed the same process for the studio albums of Everything but the Girl. The reissued editions included bonus tracks and live recordings. In a 1 August 2012 post on his Twitter profile, Frame explained that he was not involved with the Edsel Records reissue and was negotiating with a &quot;supercool US label about releasing the definitive set (w/ rarities, home demos etc.)&quot; in 2013. Domino Recording Company is the label that Frame referred to, but only &quot;High Land, Hard Rain&quot; was reissued, rather than the entire Aztec Camera catalog. In August 2013, the Domino reissue of &quot;High Land, Hard Rain&quot; was released in Europe to commemorate the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary. The reissue was remastered from the original analogue tapes and was physically produced only as a vinyl pressing, but was sold with a digital download of the album.

Domino released an expanded second version of the 30th anniversary reissue of &quot;High Land, Hard Rain&quot; in 2014 for North America that consisted of two compact discs, 16 additional rarities and liner notes from American music journalist David Fricke (a vinyl version was also released and was sold with a digital download card that provided the additional songs). To accompany the North American version, AED (Analogue Enhanced Digital) Records—a label cofounded by Collins and James Endeacott, the latter a former employee of Rough Trade—also offered a 7&quot; EP to the first 400 buyers. 
Following the August 2013 reissue of &quot;High Land, Hard Rain&quot;, Frame announced three corresponding live performances, at which the album was played in its entirety with a full band. The December 2013 shows occurred in London, Manchester and Glasgow, UK. To replicate the sound of the original recording, Frame switched guitars at the start of each song during the anniversary shows, to match the instrument used in the studio. Original Aztec Camera bassist Campbell Owens attended the Glasgow performance as an audience member—Frame later explained on the Clyde 2 radio station that Owens thanked him backstage after the show and the gesture made the experience worthwhile. At the Glasgow show, Frame and his band also played songs, such as &quot;Green Jacket Grey&quot;, that were recorded for &quot;High Land, Hard Rain&quot;, but did not appear on the final track listing.

When asked in April 2014 about reconnecting with a record that he wrote as a teenager while around the age of 50 years, Frame replied:
The songs that you write when you&#x27;re young are just a part of you—they stay with you. The interesting thing was how far I kind of strayed from the original versions over the years—I mean acoustically and everything. So, coming back and stripping them down and trying to revisit them in a kind of honest, genuine fashion was actually—even for an old cynic like me—it turned to be a very moving thing ... It [30th anniversary tour] was a very moving experience. It was like we were all revisiting our teenage years together, and it was nostalgic, but in a nice, happy, positive way.

Frame explained in May 2014 that the tour was arranged after he had reconnected with his former Aztec Camera manager, Johnson, who received a call from a prominent UK promoter who asked Frame if he was interested in the concept—Frame agreed to the tour at the time he was first asked.

==Artistry==
===Musical style and influences===

Aztec Camera were primarily a pop group centred on Frame&#x27;s acoustic guitar work, which featured prominently on their first album &quot;High Land, High Rain&quot;. Their folk- and jazz-inflected style of pop became more polished on their second album, &quot;Knife&quot;, with the introduction of electronic synthesizers and R&amp;B elements. R&amp;B grew more prominent on the third album, &quot;Love&quot;, a dance-pop outing that proved less popular. This development was throttled back for the group&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Stray&quot;, which featured more streamlined rock singles and was described by &quot;AllMusic&quot; as a &quot;loosely connected cycle mingling folk, soul, and pop in varying proportions&quot;.

Over the group&#x27;s career, their music has been described as new wave, sophisti-pop, jangle pop, indie pop, and post-punk. 

Frame cited guitarist John McGeoch as influential. &quot;He chose very simple lines over anything bombastic [...] the song came first and he tried to complement that&quot;.

===Causes===
On 21 January 1985, alongside Orange Juice, the Woodentops and Everything but the Girl, Aztec Camera raised an estimated £18,000 for the striking miners of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) through a fundraising event at the Brixton Academy—the year-long strike concluded six weeks later.

Following the release of the &quot;Love&quot; album, the band were invited to perform at a benefit concert for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) organisation in the late 1980s. Frame explained in a television interview prior to the concert that he was merely the entertainment and would not deliver any speeches.

In 1990, Aztec Camera contributed the song &quot;Do I Love You?&quot; to the Cole Porter tribute album &quot;Red Hot + Blue&quot; that was produced by the Red Hot Organization. The proceeds from the album benefited HIV/AIDS research.

==Awards and accolades==
The band&#x27;s album &quot;Love&quot; was among the nominations for &quot;Best British Album&quot; at the 1989 Brit Awards. &quot;Somewhere in My Heart&quot;, the third single from &quot;Love&quot;, was the band&#x27;s biggest hit, reaching No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart. Following the release of the &quot;Stray&quot; album, &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; was considered to be a comeback for Frame, as the preceding single &quot;The Crying Scene&quot; had only reached No. 70 in the UK.

Frame changed the band&#x27;s line-up numerous times over the course of its existence and, in a 1988 interview, Frame explained that the changes were underpinned by a desire to continually improve the quality of their music; however, he differentiated this desire from &quot;blind ambition&quot;, whereby popular success is constantly sought after. Early members included Owens (bass) and Mulholland (drums). Gannon was a member from 1983 to 1984 before joining the Smiths, while guitarist Malcolm Ross (formerly of Josef K and Orange Juice) joined the band in 1984 and played on the &quot;Knife&quot; album.

<text>Demian: The Story of a Boyhood is a bildungsroman by Hermann Hesse, first published in 1919; a prologue was added in 1960. &quot;Demian&quot; was first published under the pseudonym &quot;Emil Sinclair&quot;, the name of the narrator of the story, but Hesse was later revealed to be the author; the tenth edition was the first to bear his name.

== Plot summary ==
Emil Sinclair is a young boy raised in a middle class home, amidst what is described as a &quot;Scheinwelt&quot;, a composite word meaning &quot;world of illusion,&quot; so his entire existence can be summarised as a struggle between two worlds: the show world of illusion (related to the Hindu concept of maya) and the real world, the world of spiritual truth (see Plato&#x27;s cave and dualism). Accompanied and prompted by his mysterious classmate and friend &#x27;Max Demian&#x27;, he detaches from and revolts against the superficial ideals of the world of appearances and eventually awakens into a realization of self. The novel&#x27;s eight chapters are these:

# Two Realms
# Cain
# Among Thieves
# Beatrice
# &quot;The Bird Fights Its Way Out of the Egg&quot;
# Jacob Wrestling
# Eva
# The End Begins

== Characters ==
* Emil Sinclair is the protagonist of the novel. Sinclair is confused as to what his life is, and is going to be, and constantly seeks mentorship throughout the novel. He tends to need validation by an older figure, and finds mentors in figures such as Pistorius, Demian, and Eva.
* Sinclair&#x27;s mother and father are the symbols of safety toward which Sinclair first finds refuge, but against whom he eventually rebels.
* Franz Kromer is a bully, whose psychological torture leads Sinclair to meet Demian.
* Max Demian is a childhood friend and a mentor of Sinclair. Demian leads Sinclair to his eventual self-realization, and may be considered Emil&#x27;s daemon.
* Alfons Beck is the &quot;sarcastic and avuncular&quot; oldest boy at the boarding house where Sinclair enrolls after his confirmation. Beck serves as a minor mentor to Sinclair, and introduces Sinclair to the joys and pitfalls of alcohol.
*Pistorius is a rector, an organist at a local church, and a temporary mentor for Sinclair. Pistorius teaches Sinclair how to look inside himself for spiritual guidance.
*Frau Eva is Max Demian&#x27;s mother. She steadily becomes Sinclair&#x27;s ideal characterisation in life, first in his pictures and visions, then in person.

== Jungian influence ==
Since at least 1914, if not 1909, Hesse had been encountering the newly growing field of psychoanalysis as it moved through the German intellectual circles. During the 1910s, Hesse felt that the psychological difficulties that had tormented him since youth needed to be dealt with through psychotherapy. In 1916–17 he underwent psychoanalytic treatment with Josef Lang, a disciple of Carl Jung. Through his contact with Lang and later, in 1921, from being psychoanalyzed by Jung, Hesse became very interested in Jungian analysis and interpretation. &quot;Demian&quot; is replete with both Jungian archetypes and Jungian symbolism. In addition, psychoanalysis helped Hesse identify psychological problems which he had experienced in his youth, including internal tension caused by a conflict between his own carnal instincts and the strict moralism of his parents. Such themes appear throughout Demian as semi-autobiographical reflections upon Hesse&#x27;s own exploration of Jungian philosophy.

== Themes ==

=== Embracing duality ===
One of the major themes is the existence of opposing forces and the idea that both are necessary.

=== Spiritual enlightenment ===
The novel refers to the idea of Gnosticism, particularly the god Abraxas, showing the influence of Carl Jung&#x27;s psychology. According to Hesse, the novel is a story of Jungian individuation, the process of opening up to one&#x27;s unconsciousness.

===Women in &quot;Demian&quot;===
In the Jungian interpretation of &quot;Demian&quot;, women do not play a vital role but instead are used as feminine symbols. At the beginning, Sinclair looks up to his sisters and mother, and even his house maid. While at school, he sees a beautiful woman whom he calls Beatrice, and towards the end of the novel, when Sinclair is an adolescent man, he discovers Demian&#x27;s mother, Frau Eva. These women do not have major roles in the story, but Hesse uses them symbolically as facets of the depths of Sinclair&#x27;s mind.

== Symbols ==

=== The God Abraxas ===
The Gnostic deity Abraxas is used as a symbol throughout the text, idealizing the interdependence of all that is good and evil in the world. Demian argues that Jehovah, the Jewish God, is only one face of God; it rules over all that is wholesome, but there is another half of the world, and an infinite god must encompass both sides of this world. The symbol of Abraxas appears as a bird breaking free from an egg or a globe.

== Commentary ==
Thomas Mann wrote an introduction to the book in 1947.

<doc id="735201" wikidata="Q6502313" url="?curid=735201" title="Trickle-down economics">
<text>Trickle-down economics is a pejorative term for government economic policies deemed by opponents to disproportionately favor the upper tier of the economic spectrum (wealthy individuals and large corporations). 
These opponents reject the notion that spending by this elite group would &quot;trickle down&quot; to those who are less fortunate and lead to economic growth that will eventually benefit the economy as a whole.
According to Australian economist Heinz Arndt, use of the term has been criticized on the grounds that no mainstream economist or major political party advocates the trickle-down theory.

The term has been used broadly by critics of supply-side economics to refer to taxing and spending policies by governments that, intentionally or not, result in widening income inequality; it has also been used in critical references to neoliberalism.
While criticisms have existed since at least the 19th century, the term &quot;trickle-down economics&quot; was popularized in the US in reference to supply-side economics and the economic policies of Ronald Reagan. 

Major examples of what critics have called &quot;trickle-down economics&quot; in the US include the Reagan tax cuts, the Bush tax cuts, and the Trump tax cuts. Major UK examples include Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s economic policies in the 1980s and Liz Truss&#x27;s mini-budget tax cuts of 2022, which was an attempt to revive such Thatcherite policies. While economists who favor supply-side economics generally avoid applying the &quot;trickle down&quot; analogy to it and dispute the focus on tax cuts to the rich, the phrase &quot;trickle down&quot; has also been used by proponents of such policies. 

== History ==
===Background===

The concept that economic prosperity in the upper classes flows down into the lower classes is at least 100 years old. The term itself is used mostly by critics of the concept. The &quot;Merriam-Webster Dictionary&quot; notes that the first known use of &quot;trickle-down&quot; as an adjective meaning &quot;relating to or working on the principle of trickle-down theory&quot; was in 1944, while the first known use of &quot;trickle-down theory&quot; was in 1954.

In 1896, United States Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan described the concept using the metaphor of a &quot;leak&quot; in his William Safire traced the origin of the term to this speech. William J. Bennett credits humorist and social commentator Will Rogers for coining the term and observed in 2007 its persistent use throughout the decades since. In a 1932 column criticizing Herbert Hoover&#x27;s policies and approach to The Great Depression, Rogers wrote:

In 1933, Indian nationalist and statesman Jawaharlal Nehru wrote positively of the term (in the sense that wealth entered upper classes then &quot;trickled down&quot;) in critical reference to the colonial seizing of wealth in India and other territories being a cause of increased wealth in England:

After leaving the presidency, Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson alleged &quot;Republicans ... simply don&#x27;t know how to manage the economy. They&#x27;re so busy operating the trickle-down theory, giving the richest corporations the biggest break, that the whole thing goes to hell in a handbasket.&quot; Presidential speechwriter Samuel Rosenman wrote that &quot;trickle down policies&quot; had been prevalent in American government since 1921.

===Reagan years===
Ronald Reagan launched his 1980 campaign for the presidency on a platform advocating for supply-side economics. During the 1980 Republican Party presidential primaries, George H. W. Bush had derided Reagan&#x27;s economic approach as &quot;voodoo economics&quot;. Following Reagan&#x27;s election, the &quot;trickle-down&quot; reached wide circulation with the publication of &quot;The Education of David Stockman&quot; a December 1981 interview of Reagan&#x27;s incoming Office of Management and Budget director David Stockman, in the magazine Atlantic Monthly. In the interview, Stockman expressed doubts about supply side economics, telling journalist William Greider that the Kemp–Roth Tax Cut was a way to rebrand a tax cut for the top income bracket to make it easier to pass into law. Stockman said that &quot;It&#x27;s kind of hard to sell &#x27;trickle down,&#x27; so the supply-side formula was the only way to get a tax policy that was really &#x27;trickle down.&#x27; Supply-side is &#x27;trickle-down&#x27; theory.&quot;

Political opponents of the Reagan administration soon seized on this language in an effort to brand the administration as caring only about the wealthy. In 1982, John Kenneth Galbraith wrote the &quot;trickle-down economics&quot; that David Stockman was referring to was previously known under the name &quot;horse-and-sparrow theory&quot;, the idea that feeding a horse a huge amount of oats results in some of the feed passing through for lucky sparrows to eat. Reagan administration officials including Michael Deaver wanted Stockman to be fired in response to his comments, but he was ultimately kept on in exchange for a private apology.

== Usage ==

=== Broader use ===
While the term &quot;trickle-down&quot; is commonly used to refer to income benefits, it is sometimes used to refer to the idea of positive externalities arising from technological innovation or increased trade. Arthur Okun, and separately William Baumol, for example, have used the term to refer to the flow of the benefits of innovation, which do not accrue entirely to the &quot;great entrepreneurs and inventors&quot;, but trickle down to the masses. And Nobel laureate economist Paul Romer used the term in reference to the impact on wealth from tariff changes. The Laffer curve is often cited by proponents of trickle-down policy.

In the US, Republican tax plans and policies are often labeled &quot;trickle-down economics&quot;, including the Reagan tax cuts, the Bush tax cuts and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. In each of the aforementioned tax reforms, taxes were cut across all income brackets, but the biggest reductions were given to the highest income earners, although the Reagan Era tax reforms also introduced the earned income tax credit which has received bipartisan praise for poverty reduction and is largely why the bottom half of workers pay no federal income tax. In contrast, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 cut taxes across all income brackets, but especially favored the wealthy roughly 67x more than the middle class.

In the 1992 presidential election, independent candidate Ross Perot also referred to trickle-down economics as &quot;political voodoo&quot;. In the same election, during a presidential town hall debate, Bill Clinton blamed trickle-down economics for the declining economic conditions in America, saying that &quot;...we&#x27;ve had 12 years of trickle-down economics. We&#x27;ve gone from first to twelfth in the world in wages. We&#x27;ve had four years where we’ve produced no private-sector jobs. Most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago.&quot;.

The political campaign group, Tax Justice Network has used the term referring broadly to wealth inequality in its criticisms of tax havens. In 2013, Pope Francis condemned &quot;trickle-down theories&quot; in his apostolic exhortation , saying that &quot;Some people continue to defend trickle-down theories which assume that economic growth, encouraged by a free market, will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world. This opinion, which has never been confirmed by the facts, expresses a crude and naïve trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power and in the sacralized workings of the prevailing economic system.&quot;

In New Zealand, Damien O&#x27;Connor, an MP from the Labour Party, called trickle-down economics &quot;the rich pissing on the poor&quot; in the Labour Party campaign launch video for the 2011 general election. In a 2016 US presidential election candidates debate, Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump of supporting the &quot;most extreme&quot; version of trickle-down economics with his tax plan, calling it &quot;trumped-up trickle-down&quot; as a pun on his name. In his speech to a joint session of Congress on April 28, 2021, US President Joe Biden stated that &quot;trickle-down economics has never worked&quot;. Biden has continued to be critical of trickle-down.

A Columbia journal article comparing a failed UK Enterprise Zone proposal to later US proposals references them as a form of trickle-down policy where lower regulatory and tax burdens were aimed at wealthier developers with the hope they would benefit residents. Nobel laureate Paul Krugman states that despite the narrative of trickle-down style tax cuts, the effective tax rate of the top 1% of earners has failed to change very much. Political commentator Robert Reich has implicated institutions such as The Heritage Foundation, Cato Institute, and Club for Growth for promoting what he considers to be a discredited idea. Kansas governor and politician Sam Brownback&#x27;s 2018 tax cut package was widely labelled as an attempt at trickle-down economics. Friedrich Hayek&#x27;s economic theories have also been described as trickle-down.

=== Objections to the term ===
Speaking on the US Senate floor in 1992, Hank Brown (Republican senator for Colorado) said: &quot;Mr. President, the trickle-down theory attributed to the Republican Party has never been articulated by President Reagan and has never been articulated by President Bush and has never been advocated by either one of them. One might argue whether trickle-down makes any sense or not. To attribute to people who have advocated the opposite in policies is not only inaccurate but poisons the debate on public issues.&quot;

Thomas Sowell, a proponent of supply-side economics, says that trickle-down economics have never been advocated by any economist, writing in his 2012 book &quot;&quot;Trickle Down&quot; Theory and &quot;Tax Cuts for the Rich&quot;&quot; that &quot;[t]he &#x27;trickle-down&#x27; theory cannot be found in even the most voluminous scholarly studies of economic theories.&quot; Sowell disagrees with the characterization of supply-side economics as trickle-down, saying that the economic theory of reducing marginal tax rates works in precisely the opposite direction: &quot;Workers are always paid first and then profits flow upward later – if at all.&quot;

In 2022, the Liz Truss administration objected to characterizing its policies as &quot;trickle-down economics&quot;.
==Economic analyses of the effects of lowering taxes on the wealthy==
Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz wrote in 2015 that the post-World War II evidence does not support trickle-down economics, but rather &quot;trickle-up economics&quot; whereby more money in the pockets of the poor or the middle benefits everyone. In a 2020 research paper, economists David Hope and Julian Limberg analyzed data spanning 50 years from 18 countries, and found that tax cuts for the rich increased inequality in the short and medium term, and had no significant effect on real GDP per capita or employment in the short and medium term. According to the study, this shows that the tax cuts for the upper class did not trickle down to the broader economy.

A 2015, IMF staff discussion note by Era Dabla-Norris, Kalpana Kochhar, Nujin Suphaphiphat, Frantisek Ricka and Evridiki Tsounta suggests that lowering taxes on the top 20% could actually reduce growth. Political scientists Brainard Guy Peters and Maximilian Lennart Nagel in 2020 described the &#x27;trickle down&#x27; description of tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations stimulating economic growth that helps the less affluent as a &quot;zombie idea&quot;, and stated that it has been the most enduring failed policy idea in American politics. Some studies suggest a link between trickle-down economics and reduced growth, and some newspapers concluded that trickle-down economics does not promote jobs or growth, and that &quot;policy makers shouldn&#x27;t worry that raising taxes on the rich ... will harm their economies&quot;.

<text>Secundum quid (also called secundum quid et simpliciter, meaning &quot;[what is true] in a certain respect and [what is true] absolutely&quot;)
is a type of informal fallacy that occurs when the arguer fails to recognize the difference between rules of thumb (&quot;soft&quot; generalizations, heuristics that hold true &quot;as a general rule&quot; but leave room for exceptions) and categorical propositions, rules that hold true universally.

Since it ignores the limits, or , of rules of thumb, this fallacy is also named ignoring qualifications or sweeping generalizations. The expression misuse of a principle can be used as well.

==Example==

The arguer cites only the cases that support his point, conveniently omitting Bach, Beethoven, Brahms etc

==In popular culture==
The following quatrain can be attributed to C. H. Talbot:

&lt;poem&gt; I talked in terms whose sense was hid,
&quot;Dividendo, componendo et secundum quid&quot;;
Now &quot;secundum quid&quot; is a wise remark
And it earned my reputation as a learned clerk. &lt;/poem&gt;

==Types==

Instances of &quot;secundum quid&quot; are of two kinds:
* Accident — &quot;a dicto simpliciter ad dictum secundum quid&quot; (where an acceptable exception is ignored) [from general to qualified]. This is taking the usual case and inappropriately applying it to special cases.
* Converse accident — &quot;a dicto secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter&quot; (where an acceptable exception is eliminated or simplified) [from qualified to general]. This is taking one unusual case and inappropriately applying it to all cases.

<doc id="735214" wikidata="Q7954380" url="?curid=735214" title="WPMI-TV">
<text>WPMI-TV (channel 15) is a television station licensed to Mobile, Alabama, United States, serving as the NBC affiliate for southwest Alabama and northwest Florida. It is owned by Deerfield Media alongside Pensacola, Florida–licensed independent station WJTC (channel 44); Deerfield maintains a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Sinclair Broadcast Group, owner of Pensacola-licensed ABC affiliate WEAR-TV (channel 3) and Fort Walton Beach–licensed MyNetworkTV affiliate WFGX (channel 35), for the provision of certain services.

WPMI-TV and WJTC share studios on Azalea Road in Mobile; master control and some internal operations are based at the shared facilities of WEAR-TV and WFGX on Mobile Highway (US 90) in unincorporated Escambia County, Florida (with a Pensacola mailing address). WPMI-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located in unincorporated Baldwin County, Alabama (northeast of Robertsdale).

==History==

===Early history===
WPMI first signed on the air on March 12, 1982, and was the first independent station in the state of Alabama. It was also the first new commercial station to sign on in the Mobile–Pensacola market since future sister station WEAR signed on 28 years earlier. The station was originally owned by Hess Broadcasting and ran a general entertainment programming format consisting of cartoons, westerns, classic sitcoms, old movies, drama shows, and religious programs. WPMI&#x27;s original studios were located on St. Michael Street in Mobile. In 1985, Hess sold WPMI to Michigan Energy Resources. However, the sale did not affect programming practices. By that time, WPMI was acquiring stronger programming, such as more recent cartoons and off-network sitcom reruns. On October 9, 1986, WPMI became a charter affiliate of the Fox network and began offering prime time programming six months later.

In January 1989, Michigan Energy Resources sold WPMI to Clear Channel Communications; the company (the current-day iHeartMedia) at the time was still a small radio broadcaster in the pre-Telecommunications Act of 1996 era, and WPMI&#x27;s purchase was its first foray into television.

In 1991, Clear Channel entered into a local marketing agreement, which became a common practice at that time, with Mercury Broadcasting-owned WJTC (channel 44). The company purchased programming time on WJTC to run shows on that station that either did not fit onto WPMI&#x27;s schedule or were being burned off.

===NBC affiliation===

Fox wanted to upgrade affiliates in many markets when it acquired the rights to broadcast games from the NFL&#x27;s National Football Conference in the mid-1990s. After signing an affiliation deal with New World Communications to switch its &quot;Big Three&quot; affiliates to Fox, the network decided to make affiliate upgrades in smaller markets. In 1995, Fox formed SF Broadcasting in a joint venture with Savoy Pictures, which the network owned a voting stock in, and bought three NBC affiliates and an ABC affiliate; one of the NBC stations it acquired was local rival WALA-TV (channel 10). Almost by default, WPMI was then left to take the NBC affiliation. On January 1, 1996, WALA switched its affiliation to Fox, while the NBC affiliation moved to WPMI. The first NBC program to air on WPMI was &quot;Today&quot; at 7 a.m. Central Time.

Upon becoming an NBC affiliate, the station began airing more syndicated talk and reality shows. The NBC affiliation&#x27;s move to WPMI resulted in the station having to move most of the syndicated cartoons and most of the off-network sitcoms that it would no longer have time to air due to network programming commitments to LMA partner WJTC, which became a UPN affiliate two weeks after the switch on January 16, 1995. Clear Channel purchased WJTC outright in 2004, creating a duopoly with WPMI.

On April 20, 2007, Clear Channel Communications entered into an agreement to sell its television stations to private equity firm Providence Equity Partners, in order to focus on its radio properties. On March 15, 2008, WPMI and the other Clear Channel television properties were sold to Providence Equity-operated Newport Television.

In 2009, WPMI began using digital billboards within its viewing area, which featured headlines from the station&#x27;s Twitter feed alongside a photo of anchors Greg Peterson and Kym Thurman, and chief meteorologist Derek Beasley, a juxtaposition that would prove to be awkward when a headline regarding three people accused in a gang rape which occurred in Monroeville, Alabama, appeared next to the staff picture. A motorist took a picture of the digital billboard and sent it to a South Carolina–based blog, &quot;The Palmetto Scoop&quot;. The picture would later appear on Mashable, and was then distributed worldwide in e-mails and other blogs, becoming an internet meme. WPMI general manager Shea Grandquest and news director Wes Finley were reportedly suspended over the incident, though it was never officially confirmed by station executives.

On July 19, 2012, Newport Television announced the sale of WPMI and WJTC, along with five other television stations to the Sinclair Broadcast Group (the owner of WEAR-TV and WFGX). However, due to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules which forbid both one company from owning two of the four highest-rated stations or more than two stations overall in the same market, the licenses of WPMI and WJTC were transferred to Deerfield Media, although Sinclair would operate the two stations under a local marketing agreement. The transaction was completed on December 3, 2012. As in certain other markets where Sinclair operates two &quot;Big Three&quot; or &quot;Big Four&quot; affiliates, and due to the stations&#x27; distance from Pensacola, many of the operations of WPMI and WJTC remain separate from those of WEAR-TV and WFGX.

On July 28, 2021, the FCC issued a Forfeiture Order against Deerfield Media stemming from a lawsuit involving WPMI-TV. The lawsuit, filed by AT&amp;T, alleged that owner Deerfield Media failed to negotiate for retransmission consent in good faith for WPMI and other Sinclair-managed stations. Deerfield was ordered to pay a fine of $512,228 per station named in the lawsuit, including WPMI.

==News operation==

WPMI presently broadcasts hours of local newscasts each week (with hours each weekday, and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays).

Clear Channel Communications decided to start a full-fledged news department for WPMI shortly after the station took the NBC affiliation; the station debuted its local newscasts on January 1, 1996, with an hour-long 6 a.m. newscast, half-hour newscasts at noon and 5 p.m. on weekdays and evening newscasts at 5 and 10 p.m. nightly.

On March 17, 2006, WPMI aired a report featuring interviews with several unidentified African American residents in Crichton, Alabama, describing or speculating about a leprechaun that had reportedly been spotted in a neighborhood tree. The video went viral on the Internet and became widely known as the &quot;Crichton Leprechaun&quot; on websites such as YouTube and Google Video. The story gained national media attention from pundits such as Fox News&#x27; Bill O&#x27;Reilly and was referenced in episodes of &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;Web Junk 20&quot;, and &quot;Tosh.0&quot;, where host Daniel Tosh called the &quot;Crichton Leprechaun&quot; the &quot;&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; of Internet videos.&quot; The video has registered millions of hits and has since spawned a website selling T-shirts inspired by the video.
On August 24, 2009, WPMI adopted the &quot;Local 15&quot; branding, beginning with its 5 p.m. newscast; it also began using &quot;The Weather Authority&quot; as the brand for its weather forecasts. Both brands are a nod to Cincinnati sister station WKRC-TV, which has been known as &quot;Local 12&quot; since 2004 and used &quot;The Weather Authority&quot; name for its weather branding since the late 1980s. On April 22, 2012, WPMI-TV became the fourth and last television station in the Mobile-Pensacola market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition; the transition occurred the day after WALA-TV upgraded its own newscasts to HD.

On September 9, 2013, WPMI expanded its weekday morning newscast by a half-hour to 4:30 a.m. That same day, it also expanded its weekday noon newscast to one hour with the addition of a half-hour at 12:30 p.m. On September 23, 2013, WPMI began producing two half-hour evening newscasts on sister station WJTC that airs weeknights at 6:30 and 9 p.m.; the 9 p.m. newscast competes with WALA&#x27;s longer-established prime time newscast (which comparatively runs for one hour) and ironically, also competes with fellow sister station WFGX&#x27;s 9 p.m. newscast that is produced by WEAR-TV (a half-hour program that debuted one month earlier on August 12, 2013). The 6:30 newscast was canceled in 2016 and the 9 p.m. newscast was moved to 7 p.m. in 2018.

In June 2015, the 4:30 a.m. newscast was canceled; under FCC regulations, a company providing more than 15% of a station&#x27;s programming per week would have an &quot;attributable interest&quot; in the station, thus counting as ownership. Sinclair cannot hold an attributable interest in WPMI due to its ownership of WEAR, as both stations rank among the top four in the market.

In September 2016, WPMI scaled their noon newscast back to a half-hour to make room for the daily lifestyle program &quot;Gulf Coast Today.&quot;

In November 2019, WPMI announced they were hiring meteorologist Alan Sealls, who had worked at rival station WKRG for over 20 years until failing to reach a new contract with station management. He made his on-air debut in January 2020.

In April 2023, the morning and noon newscasts and &quot;Gulf Coast Today&quot; were canceled and 20 members of WPMI&#x27;s news staff were laid off. The morning newscast was replaced with &quot;The National Desk&quot; and the noon newscast and &quot;Gulf Coast Today&quot; were replaced with reruns of &quot;Family Feud&quot;.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WPMI-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 15, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 47 to channel 15 for post-transition operations.

<text>Burr Oak Cemetery is a cemetery located in Alsip, Illinois, United States, a suburb southwest of Chicago, Illinois. Established in 1927, Burr Oak was one of the few early Chicago cemeteries focused on the needs of the African-American community, it is the final resting place of many black celebrities, including Chicago blues musicians, athletes, and other notables.

==History==
The origins of Burr Oak Cemetery date back to when Ellis Stewart, secretary of the black-owned Supreme Liberty Life Insurance company, joined with Earl B. Dickerson, a prominent Chicago lawyer, to develop a cemetery that would meet the needs of the burgeoning African-American population in Chicago, a demographic change brought about by the great migration of blacks from the South during the early decades of the 20th century. Stewart had located a possible site for the cemetery just outside the Chicago city limits near Alsip, Illinois. The owners of the land ultimately sold 40 acres for $50,000, $40,000 of which was loaned by the Roosevelt State Bank and the remainder raised by subscription. The new group was incorporated as the Burr Oak Cemetery Association, and a suitable corpse was found in the morgue to legally dedicate the cemetery. Unfortunately, the Alsip townsfolk did not approve of a black cemetery next to the village and, &quot;with the assistance of armed police&quot;, drove the burial party away. The burial party eventually returned, however, with a deputy sheriff (courtesy of Robert E. Crowe the Republican state&#x27;s attorney) and was successfully able to legally dedicate Burr Oak.

During the Great Depression, the Burr Oak Cemetery Association defaulted on the mortgage. Dickerson again stepped in to help arrange for the black-owned Supreme Liberty Life Insurance company to buy the mortgage at roughly 10 cents to the dollar. The re-constituted Chicago Burr Oak Cemetery Association eventually paid off the mortgage. Dickerson later said that &quot;saving that cemetery was one of the great achievements as a lawyer&quot;.

==2009 scandal==
===Incident===
On July 11, 2009, Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart alleged that four workers at Burr Oak cemetery dug up more than 200 graves, dumped the bodies into unmarked mass graves, and resold the plots in a scheme that went back at least five years. The three men and one woman were charged with one count each of dismembering a human body. Two men were convicted and sentenced to six and three year prison terms.

===Investigation===
Because of the investigation, the entire cemetery was declared a crime scene by the Cook County Sheriff&#x27;s Office and temporarily closed to the public. The court-assigned receiver managing the cemetery had hoped to reopen it in September, but on October 13, 2009, visiting families found the cemetery still closed, with no statement on when it would reopen. The sheriff&#x27;s office set up a searchable database with photographs of most headstones. The cemetery records were in great disarray, but the usable ones were computerized and turned over to the receiver for integration into the database.

A study of the records indicated that between 140,190 and 147,568 people were buried at Burr Oak. However, the cemetery has space for a maximum of 130,000 graves, and some areas appear never to have been used for burials. After burials resumed in November 2009, some human remains were found in areas that no one knew had been used. On May 24, 2011, a federal judge approved a plan to place the cemetery into a trust that would use about $2.6 million of a $7 million insurance settlement to renovate and run the cemetery. The judge set aside at least $50,000 for a memorial to honor those whose graves were lost or desecrated. Those who can prove they buried relatives in the cemetery will receive $100 per grave. Those whose relatives&#x27; graves were destroyed may apply for more money.

<text>Albert Leo Schlageter (; August 12, 1894 – May 26, 1923) was an Imperial German Army officer who served in World War I before joining several &quot;Freikorps&quot; groups and carrying out acts of sabotage against French occupational forces in the Ruhr. Schlageter was arrested by French forces for sabotaging railroad tracks and executed by firing squad in 1923. After his death, he was viewed by many German nationalists as a martyr, including the Nazi Party. In Nazi Germany, Schlageter was commemorated as a national hero, which in turn led Allied occupational authorities to target such commemoration after World War II as part of the denazification process.

== Life ==
Schlageter was born in Schönau im Schwarzwald to Catholic parents.

After the outbreak of the First World War, Schlageter became a voluntary emergency worker for the military. During the war, he participated in several battles, notably Ypres (1915), the Somme (1916) and Verdun, earning the Iron Cross second and first class. Following his promotion to leutnant, he took part in the Third Battle of Ypres (1917). After the war and his dismissal from the greatly reduced army, Schlageter described himself as a student of political sciences, but he studied the subject at the most for one year.

About this time, Schlageter became a member of a right-wing student group. Soon, in March 1919, he joined the Baden Freikorps and fought against the Bolsheviks as a part of Walter von Medem&#x27;s Baltic Freikorps during the capture of Riga in May during the Latvian War of Independence. After the Landwehr was defeated in the Battle of Cēsis, he joined the German Legion of the West Russian Volunteer Army led by Pavel Bermondt-Avalov. In December 1919, after Avalov&#x27;s forces were defeated by the Latvian Army and after a short time in Lithuania, Schlageter returned to Germany.

In 1920, Schlageter took part in the Kapp Putsch and some of the battles between the military and communist factions that were convulsing Germany. His unit also took part in the Silesian Uprisings fighting on the German side. During the Third Silesian Uprising he commanded a company in the criminal assault battalion (Sturmbataillon) „Heinz&quot; of Karl G.O. Hauenstein&#x27;s volunteer corps.

Already close to Nazis, around the time of the Battle of Annaberg of 1921 Schlageter&#x27;s unit merged with the emerging Nazi Party. During the Third Silesian Uprising of 1921, Schlageter became infamous for persecuting local people and for terrorist actions against both Poles and Germans whom he and his group perceived as opposing his cause. On September 31, 1921 he participated in the murder of the parish priest Augustyn Strzybny in Modzurów. He was a founding member of the Greater German Workers&#x27; Party, a front organization for the Nazi Party.

Following the French occupation of the Ruhr in 1923, Schlageter led a group of nationalists in sabotage operations against the occupying force. The group managed to derail a number of trains. On April 7, 1923, information on Schlageter and his activities was obtained by the French, and he was arrested the following day. Tried by court-martial on May 7, 1923, he was condemned to death. On the morning of May 26, Schlageter was executed by firing squad on the Golzheimer heath near Düsseldorf.

On May 8, Schlageter had written to his parents: &quot;from 1914 until today I have sacrificed my whole strength to work for my German homeland, from love and pure loyalty. Where it was suffering, it drew me, in order to help... I was no gang leader, but in quiet labour I sought to help my fatherland. I did not commit any common crime or murder.&quot;

Almost immediately after Schlageter&#x27;s execution, Rudolf Höss murdered his alleged betrayer, Walther Kadow. He was assisted by Martin Bormann. Höss was sentenced to ten years in prison; Bormann received a one-year sentence. Höss was released from prison under a general amnesty in July 1928.

==Heroic symbol to Nazism==

After his execution he became a hero to some sections of the German population. Immediately after his death a Schlageter Memorial Society was formed, which agitated for the creation of a monument to honour him. The German Communist Party sought to debunk the emerging mythology of Schlageter by circulating a speech by Karl Radek portraying him as an honourable but misguided figure. It was the Nazi Party who most fully exploited the Schlageter story. Hitler refers to him in .
Rituals were constructed to commemorate his death, and in 1931 the Memorial Society succeeded in getting a monument erected near the site of his execution. This was a giant cross placed amid sunken stone rings. Other smaller memorials were also created.

After 1933 Schlageter became one of the principal heroes of the Nazi regime, along with Horst Wessel, a Nazi stormtrooper who had been killed in Berlin in 1930.

In June 1933, Nazis from the Passau region gathered at the Dreisessel Mountain in the Bavaria Forest to dedicate a Schlageter Memorial. In September 1933, the city of Passau dedicated its own memorial on Hammerberg, overlooking the Inn River. In the spring of 1938, Passau added a Schlageter street and a Schlageter Plaza.

The Nazis renamed the Haus der Technik in Königsberg the . Hanns Johst, the Nazi playwright, wrote (1933), a biographical drama. It was dedicated to Hitler, and was performed on his first anniversary in power as a theatrical manifesto of Nazism. The line &quot;when I hear the word culture, I reach for my gun&quot;, often misattributed to Nazi leaders, derives from this play. The original line is slightly different: &quot;&quot; &quot;Whenever I hear of culture... I release the safety-catch of my Browning!&quot; (Act 1, Scene 1). It is spoken by another character in conversation with the young Schlageter.

Several important military ventures were also named for him, including the Jagdgeschwader 26 Schlageter fighter-wing of the Luftwaffe, and the naval vessel &quot;Albert Leo Schlageter&quot;. His name was also given as a title to two SA groups, the at Düsseldorf and at Lörrach. An army barracks on the south side of Freiburg was also named after him; after World War II, the site of this barracks was occupied by the French army and renamed Quartier Vauban after the French military architect. When the French left in the 1990s, the area became the site of the eco-friendly suburb of Vauban.

Schlageter also featured as a prominent character in British author Geoffrey Moss&#x27;s 1933 novel &quot;I Face the Stars&quot;, about the rise of Nazism.

After the war, the main Schlageter memorial was destroyed by occupying Allied forces as part of the denazification process. The Schlageter memorial in Ringelai near Freyung, however, existed until 1977.

The or &quot;Schlageter Island&quot; near Soltau continues to bear the name.

<text>The Rainy River (; ) is a river, approximately long, forming part of the Canada–United States border separating Northwestern Ontario and northern Minnesota.

==History==

The river issues from the west side of Rainy Lake (French: &quot;lac à la Pluie&quot;; Ojibwe: &quot;Gojiji-zaaga&#x27;igan&quot;) and flows generally west-northwest, between International Falls, Minnesota, and Fort Frances, Ontario, and between Baudette, Minnesota, and Rainy River, Ontario. The Couchiching First Nation (the Ojibwe name spelled in transliterated form) is associated with this river, where it had traditional territory. 

The name of Koochiching County, Minnesota was derived from the Ojibwe term. Rainy Lake and the river were named by French colonists. These names were translated and adopted into English by British colonists. The town of Rainy River, Ontario was not developed until the late 19th century and not named until the early 20th century. 

The river enters the southern end of Lake of the Woods approximately northwest of the towns of Baudette and Rainy River. A dam at International Falls generates hydroelectricity from the river. The drainage basin of the river stretches east to the height of land about west of Lake Superior. It was the southeast corner of the huge tract of land granted in 1670 by the English Crown to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. The river ultimately drains through the Winnipeg River, Lake Winnipeg, and the Nelson River into Hudson Bay.

The Baudette-Rainy River International Bridge and the Fort Frances-International Falls International Bridge both cross the Rainy River.

The Ontario and Rainy River Railway, opened in 1901 and now part of Canadian National, follows the river on the Canadian side.
==Notoriety==
A white sucker weighing 6lb 8oz caught on the Rainy River near Loman, Minnesota stands as the IGFA all tackle world record.

American author Tim O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s novel &quot;The Things They Carried&quot; (1990), set during the Vietnam War, includes a chapter, &quot;On the Rainy River,&quot; referring to this territory.

<text>The Ouse Valley Way is a footpath in England, following the River Great Ouse from its source near Syresham in Northamptonshire to its mouth in The Wash near King&#x27;s Lynn. The path begins outside the King&#x27;s Head pub in Syresham and ends on the Green Quay in King&#x27;s Lynn 

There is a long-term plan to complete remaining gaps in the path, meanwhile it is possible to walk the entire route, although in places the footpath and river temporarily part company.

The route passes many interesting places and there is much to see, including attractive countryside, pretty villages, ancient English market towns, churches and a cathedral, and abundant wildlife.

Towns from source to mouth include Buckingham, Milton Keynes, Olney, Bedford, St Neots, Huntingdon, St Ives, Ely, Downham Market, and King&#x27;s Lynn.

The route is way-marked and maintained by The Countryside Agency who also provide maps and written guides online.

A small section of the Ouse Valley Way is used on the Pathfinder March.

<doc id="735233" wikidata="Q2456273" url="?curid=735233" title="Accident (fallacy)">
<text>The fallacy of accident (also called destroying the exception or a dicto simpliciter ad dictum secundum quid) is an informal fallacy where a general rule is applied to an exceptional case. The fallacy of accident gets its name from the fact that one or more accidental features of the specific case make it an exception to the rule. A generalization that is largely true may not apply in a specific case (or to some subcategory of cases) for good reasons. It is one of the thirteen fallacies originally identified by Aristotle in &quot;Sophistical Refutations&quot;. 

For example:

# People who commit crimes are criminals.
# Cutting people with knives is a crime.
# Surgeons are people who cut other people with knives.
# Therefore, surgeons are criminals.

The argument is committing the fallacy of accident because it erroneously generalizes a specific characteristic of cutting people with knives (which is a crime when done outside the context of certain professions or situations) to all instances of cutting people with knives.

== Examples ==

* Freedom of speech is a constitutionally guaranteed right. Therefore, John Q. Radical should not be arrested for his speech that incited the riot last week.
* People are obligated to keep their promises. When Jessica married Tyler, she promised to stay with him for life. Therefore, she should stay with him now, even though he has become an abusive spouse addicted to gambling and drugs.

<text>G4techTV was a short-lived American cable and satellite channel resulting from a merger between Comcast-owned G4 and TechTV. The network officially launched on May 28, 2004.

==History==

On March 25, 2004, Comcast announced its plans to purchase TechTV, a channel devoted to computers and technology. The purchase was completed on May 10, 2004, allowing Comcast to merge their G4 station with the newly acquired TechTV, resulting in G4techTV. G4techTV officially launched in the United States on May 28, 2004.

G4techTV kept shows from TechTV, such as &quot;The Screen Savers&quot;, as well as shows previously on G4, such as &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;. The merger caused one of TechTV&#x27;s most prominent personalities, Leo Laporte, to leave the channel because of a contract dispute. Laporte had been the host of &quot;Call for Help&quot;, a call-in help show, which was cut after the merger. A new &quot;Call for Help&quot; series hosted by Leo Laporte began airing on G4techTV Canada (now called G4 Canada), the Canadian affiliate of G4techTV, on August 16, 2004; the series ended on February 26, 2007. The Lab with Leo Laporte replaced &quot;Call for Help&quot; in April 2007 before ending in August 2008. The Canadian produced version of the show was briefly aired in the United States from August 2005 to January 2006, though individual episodes could have been purchased through Google Video in the U.S.

On November 11, 2004, G4techTV announced that many of its employees, including Alex Albrecht and Yoshi DeHerrera, were terminated. This came as a shock to many, and outrage and anger were expressed on the G4techTV forums. G4techTV also announced the cancellation of its popular late night variety show, &quot;Unscrewed with Martin Sargent&quot;, along with its weekly news program &quot;Pulse. Unscrewed&quot;&#x27;s host and supporting staff were terminated.

On February 15, 2005, less than a year after the merger, TechTV was officially dropped from the network&#x27;s name, and the network&#x27;s name changed to just G4.

On December 31, 2014, NBCUniversal discontinued all operations for G4; it was later relaunched on November 16, 2021, under Comcast Spectacor until that too closed on November 16, 2022.

==G4techTV Canada==

The G4techTV Canada channel launched on May 28, 2004, through a partnership with G4 Media, Rogers Media and Shaw Communications, as a domestic Canadian channel called G4techTV Canada. It was similar to G4techTV, but with more of an emphasis on technology-related programming per its CRTC licence requirements. G4techTV Canada kept the G4techTV name until mid-2009 when TechTV was dropped from the network&#x27;s name to simply become G4 Canada.

<doc id="735239" wikidata="Q777321" url="?curid=735239" title="German training ship Gorch Fock (1958)">
<text>The Gorch Fock is a tall ship of the German Navy (&quot;Deutsche Marine&quot;), built in 1958 as a replacement for the original &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; built in 1933 which was taken as war reparations by the Soviet Union after World War II, renamed Tovarishch, and returned to Germany in 2003.

Both ships are named in honour of the German writer Johann Kinau who wrote under the pseudonym &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; and died in the battle of Jutland/Skagerrak in 1916. The modern-day &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; was built in 1958 as a delayed sister ship to five ships built in the 1930s, and has since then undertaken 146 cruises (as of October 2006), including one tour around the world in 1988. She is sometimes referred to (unofficially) as the Gorch Fock II to distinguish her from her older sister ship. The &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; is under the command of the Naval Academy in Flensburg-Mürwik.

==The ship==

Germany lost all of its school ships as war reparations after World War II to the Allies, so the West German Bundesmarine decided in 1957 to have a new training vessel built following the plans for the original &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; of 1933 which by that time was owned by the Soviets, and renamed to &quot;Tovarishch&quot;. The new ship was a modernized repeat of the &quot;Albert Leo Schlageter&quot;, a slightly modified sister ship of the previous &quot;Gorch Fock&quot;.

The 1933 &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; had already been designed to be a very safe ship: she had a righting moment large enough to bring her back into the upright position even when heeling over to nearly 90°. Nevertheless some last-minute changes to the design were made in response to the &quot;Pamir&quot; disaster in 1957, especially concerning the strength of the body and the bulkheads as well as the lifesaving equipment, including the lifeboats.

The new ship was built by Blohm &amp; Voss in Hamburg, launched on 23 August 1958, and commissioned on 17 December of that year. Her home port is Kiel. The &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; is a three-masted barque with a steel hull 81.2 m (266 ft) long (without the bowsprit) and 12 m (40 ft) wide. She has a draught of some 5.2 m (17 ft) and a displacement at full load of 1760 tons. Originally, she carried of canvas sails; later, she received slightly larger sails made of synthetic materials. The tops of her fore and main masts can be lowered so that she can navigate the Kiel Canal, otherwise she would be too tall for some of the bridges spanning the canal. Officially &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; is a &quot;Type 441&quot; class naval ship with the NATO pennant number &quot;A60&quot;. Her international radio call sign is &quot;DRAX&quot;.

===Renovations and repair problems===
Over the years, various modernizations have been applied to the ship. She was fitted with air conditioning, the asbestos used originally was removed and replaced by less dangerous materials in 1991, and in that year she also received a new auxiliary engine, a six cylinder diesel engine producing 1,220 kW (1660 hp), giving the ship a top speed of under power. The interior has also been modified multiple times; technological advances made it possible to reduce the size of the galley and enlarge the crew quarters.

In November 2015 the ship was brought to the German shipyard Elsflether Werft at Bremerhaven because of hull problems with a first cost estimate of 9.6 million euro. With the discovery of more problems the estimate was stepwise raised to 64.5 million euro within a year. Despite concerns about the rising costs the Ministry of Defense approved a continuation of the repairs. In 2017 it was determined that the amount of work required was much greater; this included the almost complete replacement of the hull plating, renewal of decks and refurbishment of the engine with a cost estimated at 135 million euro. In January 2018 repairs were stopped while a review was carried out by the Ministry of Defence, including consideration of replacing &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; with a new vessel. In March 2018 it was announced that the project would continue, noting that a new vessel could not be delivered until 2025, and that the existing vessel would re-enter service in 2019. However, in January 2019 the ship was reported to be in a &quot;completely dismantled&quot; state. A review by the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Audit Office) was sharply critical of the procurement process by the Ministry of Defense. Also, at the end of January 2019, the executive board and the board of directors of the shipyard were released of their duty.

While the &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; is under repair the Romanian sister ship &quot;Mircea&quot; has been used for training.

On 1 September 2021 the &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; took to sea for the first time in six years for its first trial run after its extensive renovations.

On 30 September 2021 the &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; will be returned to the German navy.

==The figurehead==

The ship&#x27;s figurehead was designed by Heinrich Schroeteler, a former World War II U-boat commander. The figurehead has been replaced on several occasions:
* The first albatross from 1958 was lost after a few years; its replacement was made of wood, like the original.
* In 1969, the replacement was removed and replaced by a figurehead made of polyester to save weight.
* This albatross broke off when the &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; was being overhauled in 2000. It was replaced by a new one made of wood.
* On 11 December 2002, the &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; figurehead was lost in a storm. The replacement was also made of wood.
* Again, the figurehead broke off in a storm on 5 December 2003. On 24 February 2004, the ship was fitted with a new albatross, this time made of carbon fibre reinforced polyester.

==The cruises==

The &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; has been in German Navy service as a training ship since 1958. Since she has been commissioned, more than 14,500 cadets have been trained on the &quot;Gorch Fock&quot;. The &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; participates in sailing parades and Tall Ships&#x27; Races, where she is in amicable rivalry with the Italian vessel &quot;Amerigo Vespucci&quot;. Other ships of the same class include the &quot;USCGC Eagle&quot;, &quot;Sagres&quot;, &quot;Gorch Fock (1933)&quot; and &quot;Mircea&quot;. The Gorch Fock can host up to 350 passengers on board.

In 1987–88, she sailed around the world, with stopovers on five continents. Lasting 336 days, this was her second longest cruise, topped only by a training cruise in 1996–97 from Kiel to Bangkok and back that lasted 343 days.

At least six sailors have died in accidents aboard the &quot;Gorch Fock&quot;, either by falling from the rigging or by going overboard. Recent fatalities include an 18-year-old officer-candidate who went overboard at night in the North Sea on 3 September 2008. On 7 November 2010, an officer-candidate perished when she fell from the rigging. The accident happened during an exercise while the ship was moored in the port of Salvador da Bahia (Brazil).

In the aftermath of the latest accident, naval cadets refused to climb the rigging (the highest position on the main mast being ), and four of them were subsequently accused of &quot;inciting rebellion&quot;. This was described as a mutiny in some accounts. Subsequently, officers&#x27; training on board the &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; was suspended, pending a thorough review of training protocols as well as the entire training program. According to a 19 November 2010 statement issued by the German Fleet Command, the officer candidates then on board were to be flown back to Germany to continue their training while the ship was docked in Ushuaia, Argentina. The commanding officer was suspended, and a commission was appointed to investigate claims of sexual harassment and improper conduct. On 13 March 2011, all charges against the commanding officer were dismissed.

<text>Kittu crater is a crater on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Ganymede. It is approximately in diameter.

The crater shows a bright white central peak and rim, and dark brownish material surrounding it. Diffuse dark rays, sprinkled thinly atop surrounding grooved terrain, emanate from the impact site. The dark material dusted over the surface is probably part of a dark impactor (asteroid or comet) which was strewn across the surface upon impact. The impactor hit grooved terrain, and a straight segment of the crater&#x27;s rim was created when a portion of the rim collapsed along the trend of an older fault.

<doc id="735256" wikidata="Q4180497" url="?curid=735256" title="Neith (crater)">
<text>Neith is an Impact crater on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system.

Impact features like Neith have been called &quot;penepalimpsests&quot; by some investigators or &quot;dome craters&quot; by others and are considered to be transitional between craters and palimpsests. Palimpsests are bright, nearly circular patches that are believed to be remnant impact features. They occur also on Callisto, Ganymede&#x27;s neighbor farther distant from Jupiter.

The most striking feature in Neith is a large, circular dome about 45 km in diameter. The dome is surrounded by a wreath of rugged terrain. The wreath does not represent the original crater rim but the rim of a large central pit instead. The rim itself is barely visible and is located along the outer boundary of a relatively smooth, circular area, assumed to be the crater floor, which in turn surrounds the wreath of rugged terrain. In some parts along the rim, inward-facing scarps may be seen. The rim is not circular but appears to be petal-shaped. Outside the rim, a continuous ejecta blanket may be discerned.

The morphology of impact features such as Neith results either from the response of a relatively weak target material to a high-energy impact or from long-term viscous relaxation of the surface subsequent to impact.

Absolute ages derived from crater frequency measurements are model-dependent. In one crater chronology model, based on impacts dominated by asteroids, Neith may be old and very likely was formed during a period of more intense bombardment than today, about 3.9 billion years ago. In a different model, based on impacts preferentially by comets with a more or less constant impact rate, Neith may be only about 1 billion years old.

<doc id="735260" wikidata="Q166263" url="?curid=735260" title="Stiliyan Petrov">
<text>Stiliyan Alyoshev Petrov (Bulgarian: Стилиян Альошев Петров, born 5 July 1979) is a Bulgarian former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. Petrov joined Celtic from CSKA Sofia in 1999, and won ten trophies in his time at Celtic Park, including four Scottish Premier League titles. In 2006, he moved to Aston Villa in the Premier League, along with his former manager Martin O&#x27;Neill. Petrov became club captain at Villa Park, and was an inductee to the Aston Villa Hall of Fame in 2013 having made 219 competitive appearances for the club.

In addition, Petrov is Bulgaria&#x27;s all-time most-capped player with 105 appearances for the national team.

In March 2012, Petrov was diagnosed with acute leukaemia, suspending his football career to undergo treatment which was ultimately successful. He officially announced his retirement from the game in May 2013. Following spells as both a youth team and first team coach at Aston Villa in 2013 and 2015, Petrov returned to training in 2016, initially with the under-21 side, and later the seniors. He played during pre-season matches but was not offered a playing contract by manager Roberto Di Matteo.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in Montana, Petrov started to play football in the local team FC Montana. At the age of 18 he was spotted by scout and coach Dimitar Penev and signed with CSKA Sofia for fee of €30,000. With his new club, he won the Bulgarian Championship in 1997 and the national cup in 1997 and 1999.

===Celtic===
Petrov was signed in the summer of 1999 by John Barnes for a fee of £2.8 million. The teenager featured prominently in a season where he won the League Cup with Celtic, his second major honour and the first of many with Celtic. Despite the happy end to the season Petrov had a very hard time starting with the club. He was homesick and lonely at the start, and could not speak English. This was made worse by the manager playing him out of position at right back. Eventually, he improved his English by working in a friend&#x27;s burger van. This hard work and determination to fit in showed in his performances for the club.

After a good first season with Celtic he enjoyed a brilliant second season under Martin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s treble winning side, becoming a regular scorer netting 7 league goals in 28 appearances, one of which was in Celtic&#x27;s 6–2 victory over Rangers. He also became the first foreign player to win the SPFA Young Player of the Year award. However he missed the end of the season after breaking his leg in a league game against St Johnstone and missed both the Scottish League Cup and Scottish Cup finals as a result.

The following season, 2001–02, Petrov made his return from injury against Dunfermline Athletic in September, and then really came into form for Celtic, being described as a dynamic, hardworking box-to-box midfielder, and winning his second SPL medal. He was shortlisted SPFA Player of the Year in 2002.

In his fourth season with Celtic, Petrov continued his good form and was being linked to some of the top clubs in Europe but after protracted contract talks he eventually agreed a new deal with Celtic. This was his highest ever goalscoring season, netting 14 in 50 appearances. He also got to the only European final of his career, getting a runner&#x27;s up medal in the UEFA Cup.

In his next two seasons for Celtic he continued to be an essential player making 105 appearances and scoring 19 goals. He won the Scottish Cup twice in this time (scoring in the 2004 final) along with his third SPL medal. The 2004–05 season was Martin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s last at Celtic, although Stiliyan Petrov would later join him at Aston Villa. The season also saw Petrov becoming the third player to win the Celtic Player of The Year award.

The 2005–06 season was a time of great change for Celtic. Martin O&#x27;Neill, the club&#x27;s most successful manager in 20 years, left and new manager Gordon Strachan came in. Things started badly for Celtic as they lost 5–0 to Slovakian minnows Artmedia Bratislava in Strachan&#x27;s first match. Celtic then managed to throw away a 3–1 lead over Motherwell to draw Strachan&#x27;s first league match 4–4, although Petrov later helped Celtic exact revenge over the Fir Park side by scoring his first hat-trick in a 5–0 demolition in October that year. Celtic overcame their bad start to the campaign to win the SPL and League Cup double.

The 2005–06 season proved to be his last at Celtic as he re-united with former manager Martin O&#x27;Neill at Aston Villa for a fee of £6.5 million (rising to £8 million after clauses). He only made 3 appearances for Celtic before leaving in the summer transfer window.

In all, Petrov made 312 appearances for Celtic over seven years, scoring 55 goals. He won the SPL four times and also won both the Scottish and Scottish League Cup 3 times each. He was the tenth most prolific goalscorer in the SPL (55 goals) when he left Celtic. Petrov was also shortlisted for the SPFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year three times as a Celtic player.

===Aston Villa===

In April 2006, Celtic rejected a written transfer request submitted by Petrov. He was subsequently linked with a transfer to move to Aston Villa who were managed by former Celtic boss Martin O&#x27;Neill. On 30 August 2006, Petrov completed his move to Villa Park on a four-year deal worth £6.5 million, becoming O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s first signing for Villa. His debut was against West Ham United on 10 September. The game finished 1–1. In 2007, Petrov changed his shirt number from 11 to 19. Petrov scored his first Villa goal in a 2–2 draw against Sheffield United on 11 December 2006, but suffered patchy form throughout his first two seasons at the club.

He scored a volley from near the halfway line against already relegated Derby County on 12 April 2008. This was his first goal of the season and Villa won 6–0. This goal was marked as a possible candidate for &quot;goal of the season&quot;. It was also confirmed to be the furthest out recorded goal by an Aston Villa player since the club was formed.

The 2008–09 season saw Petrov&#x27;s form improve considerably as he became a first team regular, starting Villa&#x27;s six Premier League games in a row. He was named captain for the first time in the UEFA Cup game against the Bulgarian Litex Lovech on 2 October 2008 and also scored one of the goals in the game.

In May 2009, Petrov was named both Aston Villa&#x27;s supporters&#x27; &quot;Player of the Year&quot; and &quot;Players&#x27; Player of the Year&quot; for the 2008–09 season, after his notable consistency in midfield throughout the season. On 20 May 2009 he signed a new four-year deal that is set to keep him at the club until 2013.

Following the retirement of captain Martin Laursen, Petrov stated that leading a &quot;great club with a long tradition and history&quot; would be &quot;a great honour&quot;. Petrov became Villa captain in the summer of 2009 and led the team to sixth place in the Premier league, the semi-finals of the FA Cup and the final of the League Cup in his first season holding the armband.

Petrov continued to retain the Villa captaincy after the appointment of Gérard Houllier as manager of the club. On 23 October 2010, he sustained a knee injury in the 1–0 away loss against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light. On 26 December 2010, Petrov returned to first team action, coming on as a second-half substitute for Jonathan Hogg in the 2–1 defeat against Tottenham Hotspur at Villa Park. On 26 February 2011, Petrov made his 150th premier league appearance for Aston Villa at Villa Park, when he came on as a second-half substitute in the 76th minute for Robert Pires in the 4–1 win over Blackburn Rovers. On 10 September 2011, Petrov scored his first goal of the season away at Everton. On 29 October 2011, Petrov made his 200th appearance for Aston Villa in the Premier League clash with Sunderland, and scored the opening goal in a 2–2 draw.

====Career break due to leukaemia====
Petrov announced his retirement from football on 9 May 2013, due to his leukaemia.

On 26 May 2013, footballers who had represented the Bulgaria national side (including Hristo Stoichkov, Dimitar Berbatov and Nasko Sirakov) won 4–2 against a selection that featured Aston Villa veterans like Mark Kinsella and Bryan Small in an exhibition game that took place at the Vasil Levski National Stadium in Sofia and had been organised to honour Petrov&#x27;s achievements.

In October 2014, Petrov began playing again for his local Sunday League Over-35s side Wychall Wanderers who were managed by former Coventry City player David Busst.

In March 2015, he rejoined Aston Villa in a coaching role.

In April 2016 Petrov revealed he was training with Villa&#x27;s Under-21 side with a view to returning to the professional game. In June it was announced that he would be training with the first team during their pre-season tour of Austria, on a non-contractual basis. On 9 July 2016, Petrov played his first game with the Aston Villa first team since his illness, taking part in an 8–0 friendly victory over local Austrian team GAK.

==International career==

Stilyan Petrov made his debut as a 52nd minute substitute for Bulgaria on 24 December 1998 in a friendly match against Morocco. The match was played in Agadir, Morocco and finished with a 4–1 win for the North Africans. 
He scored his first goal (80th minute) for the national side in another friendly match against Belarus (4–1) on 29 March 2000.

In 2003, he won the Bulgarian Footballer of the Year award, when he was playing for Celtic and he captained the national team at Euro 2004 where he was sent off during a match against Denmark.

On 12 October 2006 Petrov, then captain of Bulgaria, announced his decision to retire from international football at the age of 27 as long as Hristo Stoichkov manages the Bulgaria national team. However, on 20 March 2007 he made amends with Hristo Stoichkov and made himself available for selection again.
However, he did not recover his position as national captain because it was decided that Dimitar Berbatov would retain the captain&#x27;s armband. On 14 January 2010, it was announced that Petrov had come second in Bulgaria&#x27;s Player of the Year.
Petrov was renamed captain of the Bulgarian side again following the retirement of Berbatov from international football in 2010. On 26 March 2011, Petrov earned his 100th cap for Bulgaria in the 0–0 home draw with Switzerland in a Euro 2012 qualifier. He received a flower bouquet from Borislav Mihaylov and was applauded by the spectators prior to the start of the match.

During his career Petrov was chosen as Bulgarian Footballer of the Year in 2003. He placed second in 2000, 2001, 2005, 2009 and 2011, and third in 2002 and 2006.

==Personal life==
In 2005, Petrov wrote his autobiography with the assistance of &quot;Sunday Mail&quot; sports journalist Mark Guidi entitled &quot;You Can Call Me Stan&quot;, in reference to his nickname &quot;Stan&quot;, a shortened form of his given name. In the book, he describes how &quot;Stiliyan&quot; is the correct spelling, rather than &quot;Stilian&quot;, as it is sometimes spelled in the press. Stiliyan is married to his wife Paulina and they have 2 sons, Kristiyan and Stiliyan Jr.

===Leukaemia===
On 30 March 2012, Petrov was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The condition was diagnosed following tests after Petrov developed a fever following Aston Villa&#x27;s 3–0 defeat to Arsenal. Because of this, Petrov told Bulgarian press that he planned to retire from club and international football; his agent later denied any reports of retirement: &quot;It is not true that Stiliyan has said he is retiring from football. What he did say was that he was fighting for his life and that he will fight to recover.&quot; He visited Villa Park for the match against Chelsea and in the 19th minute, the number of his shirt, the crowd gave him an ovation. The tribute caught the imagination of fans, and home and away fans repeated the ovation at every Villa game that season.

On 10 June 2012, Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert announced that Petrov would remain Aston Villa&#x27;s club captain for the 2012–13 season. In his absence the team captaincy was taken over by Dutch defender Ron Vlaar. On his 33rd birthday, Petrov visited his teammates on the first day of their pre season training, and was presented with a cake by the players, who sang happy birthday to him and gave him a round of applause.

On 2 August 2012, it was announced that Petrov&#x27;s leukaemia was in remission.

Petrov announced his retirement from football on 9 May 2013, and led his family out on the Villa Park pitch for a lap of honour, to applaud the Villa fans who supported him during his illness, on the final day of the 2012–13 season.

==Coaching==
On 22 May 2013, shortly after announcing his retirement from playing, Aston Villa announced that Petrov would take on a new role at the club as assistant of the Youth Development squad, working alongside Gordon Cowans.

Talking about his new role Petrov said ″I&#x27;m very excited by this new challenge and I wish to thank the Club and the manager, Paul Lambert, for giving me the opportunity to continue my association with Villa, which I have always regarded as a privilege. I will study for my coaching badges over the coming months and I am looking forward very much to working with Gordon Cowans, someone I know and respect, a true Villa legend.″

As of August 2013, Petrov was no longer part of the Villa coaching team. The Club announced his resignation and explained that he had requested time off as he felt he had to be fully devoted to his family. Petrov expressed gratitude to the club for the opportunity.

On 5 March 2015, Aston Villa Manager Tim Sherwood announced that Petrov would return to the Aston Villa backroom team and will help coach the First Team.

Petrov has completed his UEFA pro coaching licence, as well as a master&#x27;s degree in Sports Management through UEFA, as of 2020. He is currently the director of a business venture, &quot;Player 4 Player&quot;, to support players to transition into retirement, alongside other former players including Gareth Farrelly, Emile Heskey and Gaizka Mendieta.

==Television==
On 11 December 2014, Petrov appeared as a special guest on the eighth episode of the ninth series of &quot;Russell Howard&#x27;s Good News&quot;.

<doc id="735262" wikidata="Q296457" url="?curid=735262" title="Jesper Grønkjær">
<text>Jesper Grønkjær (; born 12 August 1977) is a Danish former professional footballer, who most recently worked as a pundit for Scandinavian media network Viaplay.

A pacey winger, Grønkjær played primarily on the right or left wing, or as a second striker. He played a total 400 league games for a number of European clubs, most notably winning the 1999 Dutch Cup with Ajax and playing more than 100 games for English club Chelsea. Grønkjær ended his career with Copenhagen, winning four Danish Superliga titles with the club.

Grønkjær was capped 80 times for the Denmark national team from 1999 to 2010, scoring five goals. He played for his country at the World Cup in 2002 and 2010, as well as two European Championship tournaments. He was named 1995 Danish Under-19 Player of the Year.

==Club career==

===AaB===
Raised in Thisted, Grønkjær started his career with local team Thisted. Earlier in his career he was told that he could have been a sprinter. He moved on to defending Danish Superliga champions AaB in 1995. He played almost 100 matches for the club, including games in the European 1995–96 UEFA Champions League tournament. He attracted the attention of a string of European top clubs.

===Ajax===
AaB sold Grønkjær in a £3.5 million transfer deal with Dutch club Ajax in October 1997, with Grønkjær moving to Amsterdam in July 1998. At Ajax, he was coached by fellow Dane Morten Olsen, and played alongside Danish international Ole Tobiasen. With Ajax, he won the 1998–99 KNVB Cup and he was named &quot;Ajax Player of the Year&quot; by the fans in 1999–2000 again finding himself pursued by a host of top teams.

===Chelsea===
In October 2000, Grønkjær joined Premier League club Chelsea for £7.8 million, which made him the then most expensive Danish football player. However, he was still sidelined with an injury until January 2001. His career at Chelsea lasted for four years although his form during that time was somewhat inconsistent. At his best he was a constant threat; creating and scoring some very important goals for the club. In Chelsea&#x27;s fourth round FA Cup match away to Gillingham on 28 January 2001, Grønkjær started his first match for the club and scored two goals and hit the post twice, as Chelsea won 4–2.

His most notable Chelsea performance came against Liverpool on the final day of the 2002–03 season, assisting with the first goal and scoring the second at Stamford Bridge to give Chelsea a 2–1 victory and fourth place in the league, which allowed the club to qualify for the upcoming 2003–04 UEFA Champions League tournament. The importance of this result cannot be overstated, as qualification for the Champions League was considered essential to Roman Abramovich&#x27;s impending takeover of the club, which was at the time in some financial difficulty. For this reason, it is often referred to as the &quot;billion pound goal.&quot; Talking about the match in February 2011, Grønkjær said &quot;I remember the goal very well. I was on the right wing when we got a throw-in, but instead of passing I cut in from the right and beat three or four defenders before sticking it in the other corner. It was a nice feeling, and a good reward for a great season.&quot;

In the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League quarter-final second leg away at Highbury, Grønkjær came on for Scott Parker in the second half, with Arsenal leading 1–0 on the night and 2–1 on aggregate. Within six minutes of the substitution, Chelsea equalized through a goal by Frank Lampard. As Wayne Bridge scored three minutes before the final whistle, Chelsea went on to defeat Arsenal 3–2 on aggregate and book a place in the semi-finals. In the following semi-final against Monaco, he scored from outside the penalty area with a cross-come-shot, but it was not enough for Chelsea to reach the final, as the club was defeated 5–3 on aggregate by Monaco.

Grønkjær also scored a strike in front of 67,000 fans at Old Trafford against Manchester United in the penultimate game of the 2003–04 season, the second of a three-game scoring streak. His final goal scored for Chelsea came the following week against Leeds United, where he scored the winner with a header in the first half.

===Three clubs in two years===
Chelsea had fired manager Claudio Ranieri before UEFA Euro 2004, and Grønkjær signed for Birmingham City for £2.2 million in July 2004. He had a poor start with Birmingham; manager Steve Bruce attributed this to difficulty adapting to playing in a struggling team, as &quot;he is used to his team dominating the opposition and he is used to the ball more often&quot;. He scored only once, against Lincoln City in the Football League Cup. He was transferred to Atlético Madrid in December 2004, for a fee of around €2 million. Grønkjær struggled to settle in Spain and, following putting in a transfer request, made a reported €6 million move to Bundesliga club VfB Stuttgart in the summer of 2005, where the club was building a formidable squad under manager Giovanni Trapattoni and Grønkjær would play alongside fellow Dane Jon Dahl Tomasson.

Despite the hype and expectations at the start of the season, the club struggled in mid-table. At the beginning of February 2006, Grønkjær and Tomasson openly criticised Trapattoni as &quot;lacking the will to attack and win.&quot; The criticism came after 12 drawn games out of 20, and although Trapattoni wanted to assert his authority and benched both players in the next game, he himself was fired the very next day, on 9 February 2006. Rumours in the German and Danish media suggested that Grønkjær would leave Stuttgart in favour of Danish club Copenhagen.

===Copenhagen===

Grønkjær was presented as a new player for the defending Danish Superliga champions Copenhagen on 23 June 2006. Seen as an important player for Copenhagen&#x27;s UEFA Champions League ambitions, Grønkjær helped the team qualify for the 2006–07 tournament, the first tournament participation in club history. He picked up a groin injury in a September 2006 Champions League match against Portuguese team Benfica. He was given a prognosis of an eight- to twelve-week recovery, and returned in a November game against Esbjerg in the Danish Cup. On 6 December 2006, he scored the second Champions League goal of his career, against Scottish team Celtic in a match FCK won 3–1 at the Parken Stadium. By the end of the season, Grønkjær had played 21 of 33 games, as Copenhagen retained the 2006–07 Danish Superliga championship. In November 2007, Grønkjær was named both Superliga Profile of the Year and Superliga Player of the Year.

During the closing games of the 2007–08 football season in May 2008, Grønkjær sustained a knee injury. The injury became infected by staphylococcus, and required three bouts of surgery. He did not recover until halfway through the 2008–09 football season, when he rejoined the Copenhagen team for a friendly match against Swedish team Malmö in January 2009. By the end of that season, he had again earned a place in the starting line up, as Grønkjær helped Copenhagen win the Double of both 2008–09 Danish Superliga championship and the 2008–09 Danish Cup trophy. Grønkjær played the highest number of games in his Copenhagen career during the 2009–10 football season, as he helped the club win the 2009–10 Danish Superliga championship.

With two goals in 12 games, Grønkjær helped Copenhagen advance to the 2010–11 Champions League Round of 16, as the first Danish team to advance that far into the tournament. Copenhagen was eventually eliminated by Grønkjær&#x27;s former team Chelsea. On 26 May 2011, with Copenhagen having already secured the 2010–11 Danish Superliga championship, Grønkjær announced that he would retire from professional football after the last league match of that Superliga season. &quot;I&#x27;d like to be able to go jogging when I have played my last football game,&quot; he said. &quot;I want a life without aches.&quot; He played his last game against his first professional club AaB, and scored the final goal in a 2–0 victory for Copenhagen.

===Return to football===
On 1 February 2016, it was confirmed that Grønkjær had signed with lower amateur-side Græsrødderne.

==International career==
While at Thisted, Grønkjær made his debut for the Danish youth national teams in October 1992. With three goals in six matches, as the Denmark national youth team won silver medals at the 1994 UEFA European Under-16 Football Championship, Grønkjær showed himself one of the brightest talents in Danish football. He was named 1995 Danish Under-19 Player of the Year. In total, he scored 26 goals in 64 Danish youth team international games.

In his first year at Ajax, Grønkjær made his full international debut for the Denmark national team in the 2000 European Championship (Euro 2000) qualification game against Italy on 27 March 1999. In the very first minute of the game, he famously echoed Jesper Olsen&#x27;s 1986 World Cup mistimed back pass to Spanish forward Emilio Butragueño, as Grønkjær passed the ball to Italian forward Filippo Inzaghi who promptly scored the first goal in Italy&#x27;s 2–1 victory. Despite the disappointing debut game, Grønkjær became an important part of the national team under coach Bo Johansson and he played full-time in Denmark&#x27;s three games at the Euro 2000 main tournament.

While at Chelsea, Grønkjær became a mainstay in the Denmark national team under new national team coach Morten Olsen, and he played in all of Denmark&#x27;s four games at the 2002 World Cup. In the qualification games for Euro 2004, he scored the game-winning goal in a 1–0 victory over closest rivals Norway, helping Denmark qualify for the final tournament in Portugal. He missed the opening game of Euro 2004 due to the death of his mother, but went to Portugal to join the Danish squad and scored the second goal of the 2–0 win against Bulgaria.

He was included in Olsen&#x27;s squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. After Denmark&#x27;s elimination from the 2010 World Cup, Grønkjær announced his retirement from international football.

<text>Khensu crater is a crater on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Ganymede. It is a dark-floored crater with a bright ejecta blanket located in the grooved terrain region Uruk Sulcus. The dark component may be residual material from the impactor that formed the crater. Another possibility is that the impactor may have punched through the bright surface to reveal a dark layer beneath.

<text>Andrew Jackson Lummus Jr. (October 22, 1915 – March 8, 1945) was an American professional football player and an officer in the U.S. Marine Corps. He was a two-sport athlete at Baylor University. Lummus played as an end for the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL). He fought, and died, at the Battle of Iwo Jima during World War II and received the Medal of Honor for his valor.

==Biography==
He was born in Ellis County, Texas on a cotton farm. He was the youngest child and only son of four born to Andrew Jackson Lummus Sr., and Laura Francis Lummus.

He attended Ennis High School from September 1931 through May 1934, where he was a star in football and track. He received all-district honors for football in his sophomore and junior years. He dropped out before the end of his senior year due to the views of his family that the cost of graduating, such as buying a picture and gown, were too wasteful considering the ongoing Depression. This may also have been affected by a case of influenza he contracted. He finished his high school education at Texas Military College on a two-year sports scholarship and won all-conference honors for his participation in football.

He graduated on May 28, 1937, receiving scholarship offers from Baylor University and Tulane University. He enrolled at Baylor on September 14, 1937. There, he was an All-Southwest Conference center fielder for three years and an outstanding end on the football team. Those three years, the Bears finished third in baseball, and Lummus was considered to be the best center fielder that had ever played for Baylor.

In football he played first-string end wearing No. 53. For two consecutive years, he was nominated by the Associated Press to the All-American team, and in 1938 he made honorable mention for the team. He was sometimes compared to Sam Boyd. Before he left Baylor, he signed a minor league baseball contract with the Wichita Falls Spudders, and uniform player&#x27;s contract with the New York Giants.

On May 26, 1941, an Army Air Corps recruiter came to the school. Lummus and 25 other students enlisted in the Air Corps and signed up for a civilian flying school as a result of this visit. While waiting for the Air Corps to call him, Lummus inexplicably dropped out of Baylor; he was going to graduate soon, and his academic records showed satisfactory grades. The ongoing war in Europe was thought to have influenced this decision.

After dropping out, Lummus joined the Class D Spudders of the West Texas–New Mexico League. He played right and center field. On July 6, 1941, he played his 26th, and last, game for the Spudders. The Army Air Corps had called on him to honor his enlistment papers. In those 26 games, he had a .257 batting average.

Lummus reported to Hicks Field, 40 miles northwest of Fort Worth, Texas, to enroll in the flight school there that was licensed by the Army but run by civilians. While making his first solo flight, he flew the flight plan and landed without flaw. While taxiing on the runway however, he accidentally clipped a fence with his wingtip, washing him out of flight school.

==New York Giants football career==
He then traveled to the New York Giants&#x27; training camp in Superior, Wisconsin. As one of the 30 players who made the Giants&#x27; roster, he wore No. 29. He had signed on as a free agent and received a $100 monthly salary. He made the team as a rookie end and played in nine games.

On December 7, 1941, the Giants were playing their archrival the Brooklyn Dodgers. Around half-time, the Associated Press ticker in the press box gave out a message saying, &quot;Airplanes identified as Japanese have attacked the American Naval Base at Pearl Harbor.&quot; The players continued the game, knowing nothing of the attack.
The Giants lost but went on to play the Chicago Bears in the NFL championship game.

On October 11, 2015, the Giants honored Lummus by inducting him into the New York Giants Ring of Honor.

==Military career==
After the championship game, Lummus enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve on January 30, 1942. After finishing basic training at the Mainside Recruit Training Center in San Diego, California, he was assigned to Camp Elliott, 10 miles north of San Diego. There he joined the Devildogs, the San Diego Marine Corps baseball club.

In May 1942, he was sent to the busy seaport of Mare Island as a military policeman. There he joined another baseball club. On June 10, he was promoted to private first class, and two months later he was promoted to corporal. On October 18, he enrolled at the Officers Training School at Quantico, Virginia. He graduated on December 18, and received a commission as a second lieutenant. He was sent back to California and was assigned to the elite Marine Raiders at Camp Pendleton. When the Marine Raiders were dissolved, he was assigned to the 27th Marines, 5th Marine Division.

In January 1944, he was assigned as executive officer, Company F, 2nd Battalion, 27th Marines. In August 1944, the division was transferred to Camp Tarawa outside of Waimea, Hawaii. Lummus boarded the USS &quot;Henry Clay&quot; for the trip. After four months of training, the division was assigned to the V Amphibious Corps and would fight to take the island of Iwo Jima.

==Iwo Jima==
Lummus was in the first wave of troops to land at Iwo Jima on February 19, 1945. He landed at 9 a.m. on the beach known as Red One. He and his platoon spent the next two weeks incessantly fighting the dug-in Japanese.

His initial duty was a liaison officer for the Second Battalion, spotting targets on the slopes of Mount Suribachi for artillery and air strikes. On March 6, he was given command of Company E&#x27;s third rifle platoon. On March 8, his platoon was spearheading a final assault on an objective east of Kitano Point, near the northern edge of the island. Despite minor wounds received from grenade fragmentation, Lummus knocked out three enemy strongholds, well-fortified positions arranged to defend each other, which were preventing his platoon from reaching its objective. Following this action, he stepped on a land mine and was mortally wounded, losing his legs. While lying on the ground, he urged his platoon on, until he was carried off to an aid station.

At the aid station, he famously told the doctor, Thomas M. Brown, &quot;Well, doc, the New York Giants lost a mighty good end today.&quot; He was transferred to the field hospital, where he underwent surgery and a transfusion of 18 pints of blood, but died of internal wounds on the operating table. He was buried in plot five, row 13, grave 1,244 in the Fifth Division Cemetery. His body was later moved to Ennis, Texas.

In a letter to his mother, Lummus&#x27; commanding officer wrote:

Jack suffered very little for he didn&#x27;t live long. I saw Jack soon after he was hit. With calmness, serenity and complacency, Jack said, &#x27;The New York Giants lost a good man.&#x27; We all lost a good man.

==Medal of Honor citation==
His Medal of Honor citation reads:

For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as leader of a Rifle Platoon attached to the 2d Battalion, 27th Marines, 5th Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 8 March 1945. Resuming his assault tactics with bold decision after fighting without respite for 2 days and nights, 1st Lt. Lummus slowly advanced his platoon against an enemy deeply entrenched in a network of mutually supporting positions. Suddenly halted by a terrific concentration of hostile fire, he unhesitatingly moved forward of his front lines in an effort to neutralize the Japanese position. Although knocked to the ground when an enemy grenade exploded close by, he immediately recovered himself and, again moving forward despite the intensified barrage, quickly located, attacked, and destroyed the occupied emplacement. Instantly taken under fire by the garrison of a supporting pillbox and further assailed by the slashing fury of hostile rifle fire, he fell under the impact of a second enemy grenade but, courageously disregarding painful shoulder wounds, staunchly continued his heroic 1-man assault and charged the second pillbox, annihilating all the occupants. Subsequently returning to his platoon position, he fearlessly traversed his lines under fire, encouraging his men to advance and directing the fire of supporting tanks against other stubbornly holding Japanese emplacements. Held up again by a devastating barrage, he again moved into the open, rushed a third heavily fortified installation and killed the defending troops. Determined to crush all resistance, he led his men indomitably, personally attacking foxholes and spider traps with his carbine and systematically reducing the fanatic opposition until, stepping on a land mine, he sustained fatal wounds. By his outstanding valor, skilled tactics, and tenacious perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds, 1st Lt. Lummus had inspired his stouthearted marines to continue the relentless drive northward, thereby contributing materially to the success of his regimental mission. His dauntless leadership and unwavering devotion to duty throughout sustain and enhance the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.

==Memorial==
A statue of Jack Lummus was unveiled on November 28, 2020, on the campus of Baylor University and installed in its current located near McLane Stadium. The statue was provided by Haag (BBA &#x27;88) &amp; Millette Sherman of Houston. The statue is the work of Dan Brook (BA &#x27;83), and according to the university it was created to honor Jack Lummus and remind future generations of the rich tradition of bravery among BU alumni.

<text>The term regional county municipality or RCM (, , MRC) is used in Quebec, Canada to refer to one of 87 county-like political entities. In some older English translations they were called county regional municipality.

Regional county municipalities are a supralocal type of regional municipality, and act as the local municipality in unorganized territories within their borders. The system of regional county municipalities was introduced beginning in 1979 to replace the historic counties of Quebec. In most cases, the territory of an RCM corresponds to that of a census division; however, there are a few exceptions.

Some local municipalities are outside any regional county municipality (&quot;hors MRC&quot;). This includes some municipalities within urban agglomerations and also some aboriginal lands, such as Indian reserves that are enclaves within the territory of an RCM but not juridically part of it. Where complete territorial coverage is desired, for example for the census, the Indian reserve enclaves are added in to create &quot;geographical RCMs&quot;, and the urban agglomerations are considered to be &quot;territories equivalent to an RCM&quot;.

== As political entities ==
=== Governance and responsibilities ===
The council of a RCM is composed of the mayors of the member municipalities as well as the warden. The warden is usually elected by and from the council by secret ballot. Universal suffrage may also be used. The warden&#x27;s term is two years when elected by council or four years when elected by universal suffrage.

A MRC must:

*manage land use by creating a land use scheme and revise it every five years;
*establish a plan for waste management, fire protection, and civil protection (police);
*apply the land use scheme;
*make and administer urban planning rules in unorganized territories;
*see to the proper functioning of watercourses in its territory, especially those used for agricultural drainage;
*prepare the evaluation rolls for local municipalities;
*sell buildings for property tax default;
*name or create, and fund, a local development centre to support regional businesses.

== Municipalities not belonging to an RCM ==
RCMs, in their definition as political units, do not cover the entire territory of Quebec. The local municipalities of Quebec (and equivalent Aboriginal territories) not belonging to an RCM fall into the following categories:

* all Indian reserves;
* 14 cities and urban agglomerations which do not belong to any RCM because they themselves exercise some or all of the powers which are normally those of an RCM (a city or agglomeration in some cases exercises only &quot;some&quot; of these powers because some RCM powers are in turn delegated to a metropolitan community), namely the:
**urban agglomeration of Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Quebec
**urban agglomeration of Quebec
**city of Lévis
**city of Shawinigan
**city of Trois-Rivières
**city of Sherbrooke
**urban agglomeration of Longueuil
**city of Laval
**urban agglomeration of Montreal
**city of Mirabel
**city of Gatineau
**city of Rouyn-Noranda
**urban agglomeration of La Tuque
**city of Saguenay;
* all the municipalities of the Nord-du-Québec administrative region; and
* the parish municipality of Notre-Dame-des-Anges.

== As geographical units ==
For provincial statistical purposes, the Institut de la Statistique du Québec uses the following system so that the entire territory of Quebec is divided into 104 units known as &quot;municipalités régionales de comté géographiques&quot; (MRCG) &quot;geographical regional county municipalities&quot;.

Indian reserves which would, but for their status as Indian reserves, belong to a certain RCM in the political sense are included in the geographical RCM corresponding to that RCM. There are 86 MRCGs of this kind, one for each RCM. The rest of the province is grouped into 16 &quot;territories equivalent to an RCM&quot; (French: &quot;territoires équivalents à une MRC&quot; or &quot;territoires équivalents&quot;, abbreviated &quot;TÉ&quot;), which are also considered to be MRCGs. This is done as follows.

* The 14 cities and urban agglomerations not belonging to an RCM (see above) each form their own TE, except that:
:* the TE of Québec consists of the urban agglomeration of Quebec City, the parish municipality of Notre-Dame-des-Anges and the Indian reserve of Wendake; and
:* the TE of La Tuque consists of the urban agglomeration of La Tuque and three Indian reserves.
* The Nord-du-Québec administrative region is divided into three TEs as follows:
:* The TE of Kativik is contained in the Nord-du-Québec region and consists of those municipalities under the jurisdiction of the Kativik Regional Government. The Kativik region comprises all northern villages and Inuit reserved lands, the only Naskapi village in the province, and two unorganized territories.
:* The TE of Eeyou Istchee consists of those municipalities under the jurisdiction of the Cree Regional Authority—all Cree villages and Cree reserved lands. Local administration of the new TE is shared by Cree and non-Natives, essentially along pre-2012 lines.
:* The TE of Jamésie consists of the portion of the Nord-du-Québec region which was not in the Kativik TE or the Eeyou Istchee TE. It consists of four local non-Aboriginal municipalities, and the special local municipality of Eeyou Istchee James Bay Territory, which is the territory outside the four non-Aboriginal municipalities which is jointly governed and managed by the Cree of Eeyou Istchee TE and the non-Cree of Jamésie TE.

== Census divisions ==
Census divisions (CDs) are used for statistical purposes by Statistics Canada. Quebec is divided into 98 CDs, each of which is assigned a unique two-digit geographical code. For the most part, Census Divisions consist of a single RCM or TE (territory equivalent to an RCM), exactly as defined above. The only exceptions are five census divisions divided into 11 RCMs or TEs, two or three each. For a list, see List of regional county municipalities and equivalent territories in Quebec used as census divisions.

== Geographical code of Quebec ==
All local municipalities, equivalent Aboriginal territories, Indian settlements and unorganized territories in Quebec are assigned a unique five-digit geographical code. The first two digits are the code of the census division in which the municipality is located. For a list of all municipalities in Quebec together with their legal status, geographical code and date of incorporation, see List of the official municipalities of Québec, Institut de la Statistique du Québec (ISQ). The ISQ includes the six Indian settlements in the list, whereas the Répertoire des municipalités of the Ministère des Affaires municipales et régionales does not list them as separate from the legal municipalities or unorganized territories in which they are located. Both sources include all other types of Aboriginal communities.

<text>In the NCAA men&#x27;s Division I basketball championship or the NCAA women&#x27;s Division I basketball championship, the &quot;Elite Eight&quot; comprises the final eight teams, representing the regional finals, or national quarterfinals. In Division I and Division III, the Elite Eight consists of the two teams in each of the four regional championship games. The winners advance to the Final Four. Since 1997, when the NCAA trademarked the phrase, in Division II, the Elite Eight consists of the eight winners of the eight Division II regions. Like the Division I Final Four, the Division II Elite Eight games are all held in one predetermined location.

In the men&#x27;s Division I, the lowest-seeded team ever to reach this round in the modern 64-team tournament era is No. 15 seed Saint Peter&#x27;s University in 2022.

Two No. 12 seeds have advanced to the Elite Eight: Missouri in 2002, and the Oregon State Beavers in 2021.

Ten No. 11 seeds have advanced to the Elite Eight: LSU (1986), Loyola Marymount (1990), Temple (2001), George Mason (2006), Virginia Commonwealth (2011), Dayton (2014), Xavier (2017), Loyola Chicago (2018), UCLA (2021), and North Carolina State (2024). There have only been four seasons where two double-digit-seeded teams have made it to the Elite Eight: 1990 (10 seed Texas and 11 seed LMU); 2002 (12 seed Missouri and 10 seed Kent State); 2021, where both were from the same conference (12 seed Oregon State and 11 seed UCLA); and 2022 (10 seed Miami and 15 seed Saint Peter&#x27;s).

On average, three of the four No. 1 seeds make it to the Elite Eight each year. There has only been one occurrence in history in which no No. 1 seeds made the Elite Eight (2023). In men&#x27;s play, the Elite Eight exists intact for less than 24 hours between the second Friday evening and the following Saturday afternoon of the tournament. The Elite Eight also represents the halfway mark of the men&#x27;s tournament since each qualifying team must win three rounds (games) to reach the national quarterfinals, with three rounds remaining to reach and win the national championship game.

Like &quot;March Madness,&quot; the phrase &quot;Elite Eight&quot; originally referred to the Illinois High School Boys Basketball Championship, the single-elimination high school basketball tournament run by the Illinois High School Association (IHSA). When the IHSA finals were reduced from sixteen to eight teams in 1956, a replacement nickname for Sweet Sixteen was needed, and Elite Eight won popular favor. The IHSA trademarked the term in 1995; the trademark rights are now held by the March Madness Athletic Association, a joint venture between the NCAA and IHSA formed after a 1996 court case allowed both organizations to use &quot;March Madness&quot; for their own tournaments.

The Elite Eight can also refer to the eight NCAA Division I baseball teams that reach the College World Series.

In addition, the term is often colloquially used to denote quarterfinalists in the four major North American professional sports; i.e., the teams that reach the American League Division Series and the National League Division Series in Major League Baseball, the Divisional Playoffs in either conference of the National Football League, and the conference semi-finals in the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League.

==Elite-eight teams in the men&#x27;s Division I NCAA tournament==
* During the first 12 years of the tournament (1939–50, inclusive) only eight teams competed, meaning every team that qualified in those years was an automatic &quot;Elite Eight&quot; team.
* Idaho State in 1977, which defeated UCLA in the previous round to end the Bruins&#x27; streak of consecutive Final Four appearances at 10 to end the John Wooden-era dynasty
* 11 seed LSU in 1986.
* 11 seed Loyola Marymount in 1990. One of the team&#x27;s stars, Hank Gathers, collapsed and died on the court during the WCC Tournament, and teammates (including Bo Kimble, who shot his first free throw of each tournament game left-handed) honored Gathers during the tournament.
* 12 seed Missouri in 2002
* 10 seed Kent State in 2002
* 10 seed Providence College in 1997
* 10 seed Gonzaga in 1999
* 11 seed Temple finished the 2001 regular season on a remarkable run, winning the Atlantic 10 tournament behind play of Lynn Greer before succumbing to Michigan State.
* 11 seed George Mason in 2006, which became the first 11 seed to advance to the Final Four since 1986, after defeating 1 seed Connecticut in overtime in the Elite Eight
* 10 seed Davidson College in 2008
* 11 seed Virginia Commonwealth in 2011 (the first &quot;First Four&quot; team to advance to the Final Four)
* 11 seed Dayton in 2014
* 10 seed Syracuse in 2016
* 11 seed Xavier in 2017
* 11 seed Loyola–Chicago in 2018
* 12 seed Oregon State in 2021
* 11 seed UCLA Bruins in 2021 (the second First Four team to advance to the Final Four)
* 15 seed Saint Peter&#x27;s in 2022 (first 15-seeded team to advance to Elite Eight)
* 10 seed Miami (FL) in 2022 (Head coach Jim Larrañaga is the first to take two double-digit-seeded teams to the Elite Eight under different schools—he was head coach of 11 seed George Mason in 2006.)

<doc id="735276" wikidata="Q6906320" url="?curid=735276" title="Montreal River (Wisconsin–Michigan)">
<text>The Montreal River is a river flowing to Lake Superior in northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the United States. It is long and drains approximately in a forested region. For most of its length, the river&#x27;s course defines a portion of the Wisconsin–Michigan border. The Ojibwe name for the river is &quot;Gaa-waasijiwaang&quot;, meaning &quot;where there is whitewater&quot;.

The Montreal River issues from Pine Lake in the town of Oma in eastern Iron County in northern Wisconsin. It flows initially northwardly to the boundary between Iron County and Gogebic County, Michigan, then northwestwardly along the state line, past the &#x27;twin cities&#x27; of Hurley, Wisconsin and Ironwood, Michigan. Downstream of Ironwood and Hurley the Montreal River passes over four named waterfalls. Starting below U.S. Route 2 and going downstream (north), they are Peterson, Interstate, Saxon, and Superior Falls; the last two located just upstream of the river&#x27;s mouth at Lake Superior. The river enters Oronto Bay on the southwestern shore of Lake Superior approximately northwest of Ironwood, at Michigan&#x27;s westernmost point.

The West Fork Montreal River issues from Island Lake in central Iron County and flows generally northwardly, roughly in parallel to the Montreal River, past the city of Montreal, Wisconsin. It flows into the Montreal River downstream of Hurley. There are four named waterfalls on the West Fork Montreal River: Kimball Falls, Rock Cut Falls, Gile Falls, and Spring Camp Falls.

Both forks of the Montreal River flow through the Gogebic Range, a range of hills near Hurley and Ironwood. The rivers are located in the Laurentian Mixed Forest Province (north woods) region of the upper midwest.

<text>Nergal crater is a crater on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Ganymede. It has a distinctive ejecta blanket surrounding it that&#x27;s darker nearer the craters and brighter further away. The inner region of the ejecta is characterized by a lobate appearance indicative of the flow of a liquid (or slushy) substance over the surface. The flow was probably icy surface material melted by the energy released during the impact that formed the crater.

The crater is named after the Sumerian god of war, death, and disease.

<doc id="735286" wikidata="Q5457079" url="?curid=735286" title="Flake (fish)">
<text>Flake is a term used in Australia to indicate the flesh of any of several species of shark, particularly the gummy shark. The term probably arose in the late 1920s when the large-scale commercial shark fishery off the coast of Victoria was established. Until that time, shark was generally an incidental catch rather than a targeted species.

Flake rapidly became popular. It has a mild flavour, a soft texture that nevertheless remains well-defined after cooking, and a clean white appearance. A special advantage is that flake has no bones, because sharks are cartilaginous. Those qualities, combined with ready supply and a low price, saw flake become by far the most common type of fish to be served in Australian fish and chip shops. Flake remains popular, but it is no longer especially cheap. 

Although the primary shark species sold as flake is the gummy shark, several others are listed below.

* Gummy shark, &quot;Mustelus antarcticus&quot;
* School shark, &quot;Galeorhinus galeus&quot;
* Elephant fish, &quot;Callorhinchus milii&quot;
* Whiskery shark, &quot;Furgaleus macki&quot;
* Australian blacktip shark, &quot;Carcharhinus tilstoni&quot;
* Sawshark (any of several &quot;Pristiophorus&quot; species)
* Various dog sharks (family Squalidae)
* Wobbegong (family Orectolobidae)

During the late 1960s, it became apparent that larger individuals of several shark species were contaminated with high levels of heavy metals, particularly mercury, and a public outcry eventually led to a ban on the sale of large school sharks in 1972, which remained in effect until 1985.

In Britain, nursehound is often sold as flake.

<text>Detta O&#x27;Cathain, Baroness O&#x27;Cathain, (; 2 February 1938 – 23 April 2021) was an Irish-born British businesswoman and Conservative politician.

==Early life and education==
Margaret M. B. Ó Catháin was born in Cork, daughter of Caoimhghin Ó Catháin, of Dublin, and Margaret (née Prior). She was educated at Laurel Hill Convent in Limerick, before earning a BA at University College Dublin and emigrating to England.

==Business career==
Ó Catháin was a director of many companies. She served as non-executive director of Midland Bank from 1984 to 1993, of Tesco from 1985 to 2000, and of British Airways from 1993 to 2004. She served as managing director of the Milk Marketing Board of England and Wales from 1984 to 1989 and of the Barbican Centre from 1990 to 1995. She was also a director of BNP/Paribas (UK) and Allders. In the 1983 New Year Honours she was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).

==Political career==
Baroness O&#x27;Cathain made many appearances on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; during the 1980s. She was made a life peer as Baroness O&#x27;Cathain, of The Barbican in the City of London, on 21 June 1991 and sat in the House of Lords on the Conservative benches. She served on a number of committees within the House, including the Constitution Committee and the Economic Affairs Committee. She also sat on the European Union Committee, chairing the Sub-Committee on Internal Market, Infrastructure and Employment.

She was known for her socially conservative views, in particular her efforts to retain the ban on same-sex couples from adopting, and had taken on a leadership role against gay rights after the death of Lady Young.

In 2004, Lady O&#x27;Cathain denied that her decision to step down from the board of British Airways was connected with a threatened boycott of the airline by gay rights group Stonewall. Gay rights supporters took exception to what was described as her attempted &quot;wrecking&quot; amendment of the civil partnerships bill. She responded that her amendment was &quot;nothing to do with homosexuals at all.&quot; In 2009, she proposed a law criminalising the possession of &quot;extreme pornographic writings&quot;, similar to the recently passed law on images.

In 2014, Baroness O’Cathain was selected to chair the House of Lords inquiry into civil use of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS), devices commonly referred to as drones.

== Personal life ==
Baroness O’Cathain married William Ernest John Bishop in 1963. He died in 2001.

She died at her home in Arundel, West Sussex, following a short illness, in April 2021. Baroness Janet Fookes paid tribute to her, saying that she was &quot;never afraid to speak her mind&quot;.

<doc id="735289" wikidata="Q12056630" url="?curid=735289" title="Structure and agency">
<text>In the social sciences there is a standing debate over the primacy of structure or agency in shaping human behaviour. &quot;Structure&quot; is the recurrent patterned arrangements which influence or limit the choices and opportunities available. &quot;Agency&quot; is the capacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own free choices. The structure versus agency debate may be understood as an issue of socialization against autonomy in determining whether an individual acts as a free agent or in a manner dictated by social structure.

== Structure, socialization and autonomy ==
The debate over the primacy of structure or of agency relates to an issue at the heart of both classical and contemporary sociological theory: the question of social ontology: &quot;What is the social world made of?&quot; &quot;What is a cause of the social world, and what is an effect?&quot; &quot;Do social structures determine an individual&#x27;s behaviour or does human agency?&quot;

Structural functionalists such as Émile Durkheim see structure and hierarchy as essential in establishing the very existence of society. Theorists such as Karl Marx, by contrast, emphasize that the social structure can act to the detriment of the majority of individuals in a society. In both these instances &quot;structure&quot; may refer to something both material (or &quot;economic&quot;) and cultural (i.e. related to norms, customs, traditions and ideologies).

Some theorists put forward that what we know as our social existence is largely determined by the overall structure of society. The perceived agency of individuals can also mostly be explained by the operation of this structure. Theoretical systems aligned with this view include:

* structuralism
* some forms of functionalism
* Orthodox Marxism

All of these schools in this context can be seen as forms of holism – the notion that &quot;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&quot;.

On the other hand, other theorists stress the capacity of individual &quot;agents&quot; to construct and reconstruct their worlds. In this sense the individual can be viewed as more influential than the system. Theoretical systems aligned with this view include:

* methodological individualism
* social phenomenology
* interactionism
* ethnomethodology

Lastly, a third option, taken by many modern social theorists, attempts to find a point of balance between the two previous positions. They see structure and agency as complementary forces – structure influences human behaviour, and humans are capable of changing the social structures they inhabit. Structuration issue one prominent example of this view.

The first approach (emphasizing the importance of societal structure) dominated in classical sociology. Theorists saw unique aspects of the social world that could not be explained simply by the sum of the individuals present. Durkheim strongly believed that the collective had emergent properties of its own and saw the need for a science which would deal with this emergence.
The second approach (methodological individualism, etc.), however, also has a well-established position in social science. Many theorists still follow this course (economists, for example, tend to disregard any kind of holism).

The central debate, therefore, pits theorists committed to the notions of methodological holism against those committed to methodological individualism. The first notion, methodological holism, is the idea that actors are socialized and embedded into social structures and institutions that constrain, or enable, and generally shape the individuals&#x27; dispositions towards, and capacities for, action, and that this social structure should be taken as primary and most significant. The second notion, methodological individualism, is the idea that actors are the central theoretical and ontological elements in social systems, and social structure is an epiphenomenon, a result and consequence of the actions and activities of interacting individuals.

== Major theorists ==

=== Georg Simmel ===
Georg Simmel (1858–1918) was one of the first generation of German nonpositivist sociologists. His studies pioneered the concepts of social structure and agency. His most famous works today include &quot;The Metropolis and Mental Life&quot; and &quot;The Philosophy of Money&quot;.

=== Norbert Elias ===
Norbert Elias (1897–1990) was a German sociologist whose work focused on the relationship between power, behaviour, emotion, and knowledge over time. He significantly shaped what is called &quot;process sociology&quot; or &quot;figurational sociology&quot;.

=== Talcott Parsons ===
Talcott Parsons (1902–1979) was an American sociologist and the main theorist of action theory (misleadingly called &quot;structural functionalism&quot;) in sociology from the 1930s in the United States. His works analyze social structure but in terms of voluntary action and through patterns of normative institutionalization by codifying its theoretical gestalt into a system-theoretical framework based on the idea of living systems and cybernetic hierarchy. For Parsons there is no structure–agency problem. It is a pseudo-problem. His development of Max Weber&#x27;s means-end action structure is summarized in Instrumental and value-rational action

=== Pierre Bourdieu ===
Pierre Bourdieu (1930–2002) was a French theorist who presented his &quot;theory of practice&quot; on the dichotomic understanding of the relation between agency and structure in a great number of publications, beginning with &quot;An Outline of the Theory of Practice&quot; in 1972, where he presented the concept of habitus. His book &quot;Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste&quot; (1979), was named as one of the 20th century&#x27;s 10 most important works of sociology by the International Sociological Association.

The key concepts in Bourdieu&#x27;s work are habitus, field, and capital. The agent is socialized in a &quot;field&quot;, an evolving set of roles and relationships in a social domain, where various forms of &quot;capital&quot; such as prestige or financial resources are at stake. As the agent accommodates to their roles and relationships in the context of their position in the field, they internalize relationships and expectations for operating in that domain. These internalized relationships and habitual expectations and relationships form, over time, the &quot;habitus&quot;.

Bourdieu&#x27;s work attempts to reconcile structure and agency, as external structures are internalized into the habitus while the actions of the agent externalize interactions between actors into the social relationships in the field. Bourdieu&#x27;s theory, therefore, is a dialectic between &quot;externalizing the internal&quot;, and &quot;internalizing the external&quot;.

=== Berger and Luckmann ===
Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann in their &quot;Social Construction of Reality&quot; (1966) saw the relationship between structure and agency as dialectical. Society forms the individuals who create society – forming a continuous loop.

=== James Coleman ===
The sociologist James Samuel Coleman famously diagramed the link between macrosociological phenomena and individual behaviour in what is commonly referred to as &quot;Coleman&#x27;s Boat&quot;. A macro-level phenomenon is described as instigating particular actions by individuals, which results in a subsequent macro-level phenomenon. In this way, individual action is taken in reference to a macro-sociological structure, and that action (by many individuals) results in change to that macro-structure.

=== Anthony Giddens ===
Contemporary sociology has generally aimed toward a reconciliation of structure and agency as concepts. Anthony Giddens has developed structuration theory in such works as &quot;The Constitution of Society&quot; (1984). He presents a developed attempt to move beyond the dualism of structure and agency and argues for the &quot;duality of structure&quot; – where social structure is both the medium and the outcome of social action, and agents and structures as mutually constitutive entities with &quot;equal ontological status&quot;. For Giddens, an agent&#x27;s common interaction with structure, as a system of norms, is described as &quot;structuration&quot;. The term &quot;reflexivity&quot; is used to refer to the ability of an agent to consciously alter his or her place in the social structure; thus globalization and the emergence of the &#x27;post-traditional&#x27; society might be said to allow for &quot;greater social reflexivity&quot;. Social and political sciences are therefore important because social knowledge, as self-knowledge, is potentially emancipatory.

=== Klaus Hurrelmann ===
His access to research on structure and agency is characterized by socialization theory. Central to the theory is the life-long interaction between the individual and his/her longing for freedom and autonomy, and society with its pressure of order and structure. As he states in his &quot;Model of Productive Processing of Reality (PPR)&quot;, personality &quot;does not form independently from society any of its functions or dimensions but is continuously being shaped, in a concrete, historically conveyed life world, throughout the entire space of the life span&quot;. The PPR model places the human subject in a social and ecological context that must be absorbed and processed subjectively. The human being as an autonomous subject has the lifelong task to harmonize the processes of social integration and personal individualization. This task is mastered in specific steps that are typical for the respective age and the achieved developmental stage (&quot;developmental tasks&quot;).

=== Roberto Unger ===
The social theorist and legal philosopher Roberto Mangabeira Unger developed the thesis of negative capability to address this problem of agency in relation to structure. In his work on false necessity – or anti-necessitarian social theory – Unger recognizes the constraints of structure and its molding influence upon the individual, but at the same time finds the individual able to resist, deny, and transcend their context. The varieties of this resistance are negative capability. Unlike other theories of structure and agency, &quot;negative capability&quot; does not reduce the individual to a simple actor possessing only the dual capacity of compliance or rebellion, but rather sees him or her as able to partake in a variety of activities of self empowerment.

== Recent developments ==
A recent development in the debate is the critical realist structure/agency perspective embodied in Roy Bhaskar&#x27;s transformational model of social action (TMSA) which he later expanded into his concept of four-planar social being. A major difference between Giddens&#x27; structuration theory and the TMSA is that the TMSA includes a temporal element (time). The TMSA has been further advocated and applied in other social science fields by additional authors, for example in economics by Tony Lawson and in sociology by Margaret Archer. In 2005, the &quot;Journal of Management Studies&quot; debated the merits of critical realism.

Kenneth Wilkinson in the &quot;Community in Rural America&quot; took an interactional/field theoretical perspective focusing on the role of community agency in contributing to the emergence of community.

With critical psychology as a framework, the Danish psychologist Ole Dreier proposes in his book &quot;Psychotherapy in Everyday Life&quot; that we may best conceptualize persons as participants in social practices (that constitute social structures) who can either reproduce or change these social practices. This indicates that neither participants, nor social practices can be understood when looked at in isolation (in fact, this undermines the very idea of trying to do so), since practice and structure is co-created by participants and since the participants can only be called so, if they &quot;participate&quot; in a social practice.

The structure/agency debate continues to evolve, with contributions such as Nicos Mouzelis&#x27;s &quot;Sociological Theory: What Went Wrong?&quot; and Margaret Archer&#x27;s &quot;Realist Social Theory: The Morphogenetic Approach&quot; continuing to push the ongoing development of structure/agency theory. Work in information systems by has emphasized Archer&#x27;s Realist Social Theory as well as application in the field of education policy and organization theory. In entrepreneurship a discussion between Sarason et al. and used Archer&#x27;s theory to critique structuration by arguing that starting a new business organization needs to be understood in the context of social structure and agency. However, this depends upon one&#x27;s view of structure, which differs between Giddens and Archer. Hence if strata in social reality have different ontologies, then they must be viewed as a dualism. Moreover, agents have causal power, and ultimate concerns which they try to fallibly put into practice. Mole and Mole propose entrepreneurship as the study of the interplay between the structures of a society and the agents within it.

== Purported differences in approach between European and American thinkers ==

While the structure–agency debate has been a central issue in social theory, and recent theoretical reconciliation attempts have been made, structure–agency theory has tended to develop more in European countries by European theorists, while social theorists from the United States have tended to focus instead on the issue of integration between macrosociological and microsociological perspectives. George Ritzer examines these issues (and surveys the structure agency debate) in greater detail in his book &quot;Modern Sociological Theory&quot; (2000).

It tells the story of Dr. Dolittle as he tries to help the animals protect their forest from unscrupulous human developers. He decides to populate the forest with a species of animal that the law protects, and enlists the help of Ava (voiced by Lisa Kudrow), a lone Pacific western bear living in the condemned forest. To provide her with a mate, Dolittle turns to Archie (voiced by Steve Zahn), a wise-cracking circus-performing bear.

This is the last &quot;Dr. Dolittle&quot; film to feature Eddie Murphy in the lead role, before Kyla Pratt assumed the lead role in future films, starting with &quot;Dr. Dolittle 3&quot; in 2006. It is also the last &quot;Dr. Dolittle&quot; film to feature Raven-Symoné as Charisse Dolittle.

==Plot==
Three years after the events of the first film, veterinarian Dr. John Dolittle&#x27;s ability to talk to animals has made him famous, and he travels the world performing his skills. Returning home from France, he gives his younger daughter Maya a chameleon named Pepito, and grounds his eldest daughter Charisse for doing poorly in school, confiscating her phone for a week. Charisse&#x27;s boyfriend Eric joins the family for the former’s 16th birthday party, where an opossum and a raccoon named Joey tell John that their boss, the Godbeaver (Godfather of the rodent mafia), wants to see him. John meets the Godbeaver and agrees to save the forest from being cut down by mating an endangered female Pacific western bear with a male.

At a circus, John persuades Archie, the sole surviving Pacific western male, to accompany him to the forest and become a real bear. John takes his family on a month-long vacation to the forest, where he makes a deal with the sole surviving Pacific western female bear named Ava, who is involved with a male Kodiak bear named Sonny. She agrees not to make any decisions for a month after John promises to turn Archie into a bear she will love.

Struggling to train Archie, who is used to the pampered lifestyle, John hires the local forest creatures to chaperone Charisse and Eric, and neglects his wife Lisa. After assuring Archie that he will find a way to win Ava&#x27;s heart, John attempts to win Lisa back by dancing in their cabin, with every animal in the forest watching, but Lucky the dog accidentally ruins it.

Archie attempts to get Ava&#x27;s attention by imitating John singing, but falls from a tree branch. Humiliated, he refuses to leave his new-found cave, but becomes frustrated with John&#x27;s insults and knocks him into a muddy hole, finally listening to his &quot;inner bear&quot;. Later, Archie spends the day with Ava, whose relationship with Sonny is declining. Lucky tries to woo a female wolf, successfully urinating around her territory, but is interrupted by one of her packmates before she agrees to go out with him. Meanwhile, Sonny forces Ava to leave Archie.

Logging magnate Joseph Potter and his lawyer Jack Riley attempt to make a deal with John to spare some parts of the forest, until Archie tells John he has prepared his &quot;big finish&quot; to win Ava and goes after a beehive at the edge of a tall hill, ignoring John&#x27;s warnings and the attacking bees who also attack a nearby Riley. He manages to get the hive, finally winning Ava&#x27;s heart and the respect of the other forest animals. Ava then dumps Sonny, finally having had enough of his rudeness to Archie.

In a game of hide and seek with Ava, Archie is tranquilized by Riley. John learns that Archie had somewhat destroyed the back of a restaurant. After getting information from a weasel, John visits Archie in jail, telling him that he may be too dangerous to go free and will be sold to a Mexican circus, ending John&#x27;s chance of saving the forest. His determination is quickly reignited, however, when John realizes that Charisse has developed her father&#x27;s gift of talking to animals. He rallies the animals of the forest not to give up without a fight and free Archie. Charisse, Eric, and Maya rebel against the loggers with the aid of wolves, while word of Archie&#x27;s predicament spreads, leading animals around the world to go on strike.

At Potter Wood Industries, Mr. Potter and Riley are attacked by the animals. While Riley takes the brunt from the birds, wolves, and bees, Mr. Potter is cornered by Ava and Joey, forcing him to finally start negotiating with John and the animals. As the negotiations go on, the strike continues to grow with several animal pros like race horses and Shamu getting in on the act. Finally, a deal is made and the Dolittles and animals accept, freeing Archie and saving the entire forest outside San Francisco.

John and Charisse become closer, talking with and helping animals together, while Archie and Ava mate and have two cubs who try to take after their father.

==Reception==
===Box office===
On its opening weekend, the film grossed $25,037,039 from 3,049 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking #2 at the box office, behind &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;. Like the first film, it was the best debut for a Fox film that week. By the end of its run, &quot;Dr. Dolittle 2&quot; had grossed $112,952,899 domestically and $63,151,445 internationally, totaling $176,104,344 worldwide.

===Critical response===
Like the 1998 version, &quot;Dr Dolittle 2&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 42% based on reviews from 107 critics, with an average rating of 5.00/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Although there are laughs to be had in &quot;Dr. Dolittle 2&quot;, its preoccupation with toilet humor and Murphy&#x27;s restrained performance makes this a missed opportunity&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100 based on reviews from 28 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B+&quot; on scale of A to F.

Joe Leydon of Variety said &quot;the film has all the symptoms of a sure-fire smash hit&quot;, noting that it was more family-friendly than its predecessor, and that &quot;Eddie Murphy [is] once again in fine form&quot;. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it 3 out of 4, calling it &quot;cute, crude and good-hearted movie&quot;. Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised Eddie Murphy saying that after having been upstaged by the animals in the first film &quot;brings bite as well as bark to the funnier sequel&quot;. Desson Thomson also of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; did not find the film funny, called it forgettable and thought it should have gone straight to video.

==Home media==
&quot;Dr. Dolittle 2&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on October 23, 2001 and generated $7.32 million in its first week in stores.

<doc id="735297" wikidata="Q6382670" url="?curid=735297" title="Keebler Company">
<text>The Keebler Company is an American cookie and former cracker manufacturer. Founded in 1853, it has produced numerous baked snacks, advertised with the Keebler Elves. Keebler had marketed its brands such as Cheez-It (which bear the Sunshine Biscuits brand), Chips Deluxe, Club Crackers, E.L. Fudge Cookies, Famous Amos, Fudge Shoppe Cookies, Murray cookies, Austin, Plantation, Vienna Fingers, Town House Crackers, Wheatables, Sandie&#x27;s Shortbread, Pizzarias Pizza Chips, Chachos and Zesta Crackers, among others. Keebler slogans have included &quot;Uncommonly Good&quot; and &quot;a little elfin magic goes a long way&quot;. Tom Shutter and Leo Burnett wrote the familiar jingle. 

The cookie and cracker lines were separated when Kellogg&#x27;s sold the cookie line and the rights of the Keebler name to Ferrero SpA in 2019. The cracker lines are now marketed under the Kellogg&#x27;s or Sunshine names.

==Company history==

Godfrey Keebler, of German descent, opened a bakery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1853. His bakery networked with several other local bakeries and others around the country over the years, and in 1927 they merged into the United Biscuit Company of America.

United Biscuit operated regional bakeries which included not only Keebler, but also Hekman Biscuit Company of Grand Rapids, Michigan, the Strietmann Biscuit Company of Mariemont, Ohio Merchants Biscuit Company of Denver, and the Bowman Biscuit Company of Denver which used the Supreme brand name. By 1963, United Biscuit introduced the Kitchen Rich brand nationally while still utilizing the regional brand names. In 1966, United Biscuit decided to adopt a uniform brand name and chose Keebler as the national brand and the name of the company. Keebler did adopt Streitmann&#x27;s Zesta saltine brand as Keebler&#x27;s national brand of saltine crackers. 

Keebler-Weyl Bakery became the official baker of Girl Scout Cookies in 1936, the first commercial company to bake the cookies (the scouts and their mothers had done it previously). By 1978, four companies were producing the cookies. Little Brownie Bakers is the Keebler division still licensed to produce the cookies. 

In 1974, Keebler was acquired by United Biscuits, a British multinational food manufacturer, headquartered in West Drayton, Middlesex, England. By the 1980s, Keebler had expanded into the bagged salty snack market, launching a string of successful and innovative snack chips such as Tato Skins, O&#x27;Boisies, and Pizzarias. In 1995, United Biscuits announced plans to spin off the snack chip business, but ended up selling the entire company to a partnership between Flowers Industries and Artal Luxembourg, a private equity firm. Artal Luxembourg sold its holdings in Keebler in an IPO in 1998.

The Keebler Company purchased Sunshine Biscuits in 1996. 

In 2000, the Keebler Company acquired a license to produce snacks based on the popular children&#x27;s show &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

In March 2001, The Keebler Company was acquired by the Kellogg Company. At that time, headquarters were located in Elmhurst, Illinois.

On April 1, 2019, Kellogg announced that it was selling Keebler cookies and other related brands to Ferrero SpA for $1.3 billion. The acquisition is a part of Ferrero&#x27;s strategy to buy brands which have been neglected within broader food companies&#x27; portfolios. Kellogg retained the rights to other Keebler products, such as crackers, either under the Kellogg&#x27;s or Sunshine names. The acquisition closed on July 29, 2019.

==Keebler Elves==
The animated Keebler Elves, led by &quot;Ernest J. &#x27;Ernie&#x27; Keebler&quot;, rank among the best-known characters from commercials. Ernie is the head elf and the friendliest of the bunch. The elves have appeared in countless television advertisements throughout the years (most of them animated at FilmFair), shown baking their unique products. In the commercials, the Keebler tree logo is often turned into the tree in which the elves reside.

Leo Burnett Worldwide, an advertising agency, created the elves in 1968, calling the bakery &quot;The Hollow Tree Factory.&quot;

J.J. Keebler was the original &quot;king elf&quot; in 1969, and was featured in a classroom film about how animated commercials are made, &quot;Show and Sell&quot;, with J.J.&#x27;s voice performed by Alan Reed, Sr. Ernie Keebler became &quot;head elf&quot; in 1970. White-haired Ernie wears a green jacket, a white shirt with a yellow tie, a red vest, and floppy shoes.

Ernie Keebler was voiced by Parley Baer from 1969 until he suffered a stroke in 1997. He was followed by Walker Edmiston, who voiced the character from 1997 to 2007. Frank Welker portrayed the character from 2007 to 2009. Richard Henzel has voiced the character since 2016.

Other elves were Fryer Tuck (who promoted &quot;Munch-ems&quot;), Ernie&#x27;s nephews Zoot and J.J. (known for Pizzarias Pizza Chips), Ernie&#x27;s mother Ma Keebler, young Elmer Keebler, Buckets (who threw fudge on the cookies), Fast Eddie (who wrapped the products), Sam (the peanut butter baker), Roger (the jeweler), Doc (the doctor and cookie maker), Zack (the fudge shoppe supervisor), Flo (the accountant), Leonardo (the artist), Elwood (who ran through the dough), Professor, Edison, Larry and Art. Frank Welker voiced a number of the Elves. Many of the Keebler commercials were narrated by the announcer Danny Dark. The first Keebler elves were drawn by children&#x27;s author/illustrator and commercial artist Roger Bradfield.

<text>Mercury-Redstone 2 (MR-2) was the test flight of the Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle just prior to the first crewed American space mission in Project Mercury. Carrying a chimpanzee named Ham on a suborbital flight, Mercury spacecraft Number 5 was launched at 16:55 UTC on January 31, 1961, from LC-5 at Cape Canaveral, Florida. The capsule and Ham, the first great ape in space, landed safely in the Atlantic Ocean 16 minutes and 39 seconds after launch.

==Background==

The previous Mercury-Redstone mission, MR-1A, flew a trajectory that was too steep with accelerations too high for a human passenger. MR-1A had climbed to its programmed apogee of about and landed downrange. Mercury-Redstone 2 would follow a more flattened trajectory. Its planned flight path was an apogee of and a range of .

==Mission==

Mercury spacecraft Number 5 contained six new systems that had not been on previous flights: environmental control system, attitude stabilization control system, live retrorockets, voice communications system, &quot;closed loop&quot; abort sensing system, and a pneumatic landing bag.

Six chimpanzees (four female and two male) and 20 medical specialists and animal handlers from Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, where the chimpanzees lived and were trained, were moved into quarters behind Hangar S at Cape Canaveral, Florida on January 2, 1961. The six chimpanzees were trained in Mercury simulators for three weeks. The day before the flight, two chimpanzees were chosen for the mission: one primary, Ham, and one backup, a female chimpanzee named Minnie. The competition was fierce, but Ham was full of energy and good humor. Ham was named in honor of Holloman Aerospace Medical Center. Ham was from Cameroon, Africa, (original name Chang, Chimp No. 65) and was purchased by the USAF July 9, 1959. He was 3 years 8 months old at launch.

At 12:53 UTC, January 31, 1961, Ham was inserted into the spacecraft. The countdown was then delayed almost four hours because of a hot inverter, and several other minor problems.

At 16:55 UTC the MR-2 lifted off. One minute after the launch, computers reported that the flight path angle was at least one degree too high and rising. At two minutes, the computers predicted a 17 &quot;g&quot; (167 m/s²) acceleration. At 2 minutes 17 seconds into the flight, the Redstone&#x27;s liquid oxygen (LOX) fuel was depleted. The closed-loop abort system sensed a change in engine chamber pressure when the LOX supply was depleted and fired the launch escape system. The abort signaled a Mayday message to the recovery forces.

The high flight angle, and the early abort, caused the maximum velocity of the spacecraft, relative to the Earth&#x27;s surface, to be instead of the planned . The retrorockets had been jettisoned during the abort and therefore could not be used to slow down the spacecraft. All of this added up to an overshoot of the planned landing area by and an apogee of instead of .

Another problem occurred at 2 minutes and 18 seconds into the flight, when cabin pressure dropped from 5.5 to 1 lb/in² (38 to 7 kPa). This malfunction was traced later to the air inlet snorkel valve. Vibrations had loosened a pin in the snorkel valve and allowed the valve to open. Ham was safe in his own couch spacesuit and did not suffer any ill effects from the loss of cabin pressure. His couch spacesuit pressure remained normal, and suit temperature stayed well within the 60 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (16 to 26 °C) optimum range.

Because of over-acceleration of the launch vehicle and the boost from the escape rocket, a speed relative to the Earth&#x27;s surface of was reached instead of the planned. At apogee Ham&#x27;s spacecraft was farther downrange than planned. Ham was weightless for 6.6 minutes instead of the 4.9 minutes that were planned. The spacecraft landed downrange after a 16.5-minute flight. He received 14.7 &quot;g&quot; (144 m/s²) during reentry, almost 3 &quot;g&quot; (29 m/s²) greater than planned.

Ham performed his tasks well, pushing levers about 50 times during the flight. Onboard cameras filming Ham&#x27;s reaction to weightlessness showed a surprising amount of dust and debris floating around inside the capsule during apogee. 

The spacecraft splashed down about 12:12 pm. EST, out of sight from recovery forces. About 12 minutes later, the first recovery signal was received from the spacecraft. Tracking showed it was about from the nearest recovery ship. Twenty-seven minutes after landing, a search plane sighted the capsule floating upright in the Atlantic. The search plane requested that the Navy send its rescue helicopters from the closest ship carrying them.

When helicopters arrived they found the spacecraft on its side, taking on water, and submerging. Upon water impact, the beryllium heat shield had bounced against the capsule bottom, punching two holes in the titanium pressure bulkhead. The landing bag had worn badly, and the heatshield was torn free from the spacecraft before recovery. After the craft capsized, the open snorkel valve let still more sea water enter the capsule. When the helicopter crew finally latched onto and picked up Ham&#x27;s spacecraft at 18:52 UTC., they estimated there was about of sea water aboard. The spacecraft was flown to and lowered to the deck of . When the spacecraft was opened Ham appeared to be in good condition and readily accepted an apple and half an orange.

==Post-flight==

With the malfunctions during the flight, the Mercury-Redstone was deemed not ready for a human passenger planned for MR-3. It was postponed pending a final booster development flight, Mercury-Redstone BD.

After his spaceflight, Ham was transferred to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. for 17 years and then in 1981 was moved to a zoo in North Carolina to live with a colony of other chimpanzees. He died on January 19, 1983, at the age of 26. Ham is buried at the New Mexico Museum of Space History in Alamogordo, New Mexico. He was one of many animals in space.

Ham&#x27;s backup, Minnie, was the only female chimpanzee trained for the Mercury program. After her role in the Mercury program ended, Minnie became part of an Air Force chimp-breeding program, producing nine offspring and helping raise the offspring of several other members of the chimpanzee colony. She was the last surviving &quot;astro-chimp&quot;. She died at the age of 41 on March 14, 1998.

Mercury spacecraft No. 5, used in the Mercury-Redstone 2 mission, is currently displayed at the California Science Center, Los Angeles, California.

<text>Samuel Adrian Baugh (March 17, 1914 – December 17, 2008) was an American professional football quarterback who played 16 seasons with the Washington Redskins of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the TCU Horned Frogs, where he was a two time All-American prior to being selected by the Redskins in the first round of the 1937 NFL draft. With the Redskins, Baugh won NFL Championships in 1937 and 1942 and led the NFL in completion percentage eight times, passing yards four times, and passing touchdowns once.

Baugh also played as a punter and safety, leading the NFL in punting average five times and in defensive interceptions with 11 in 1943. After his playing career, he served as a college coach for the Hardin–Simmons Cowboys before coaching professionally for the New York Titans and Houston Oilers. Baugh was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963 and was named to the NFL&#x27;s 75th and 100th Anniversary All-Time teams.

==Early life==
Baugh was born on March 17, 1914, in Temple, Texas, the second son of James, a worker on the Santa Fe Railroad, and Lucy Baugh. His parents later divorced and his mother raised the three children. When he was 16, the family then moved to Sweetwater, Texas, and he attended Sweetwater High School. As the quarterback of his high school football team (Sweetwater Mustangs), he practiced for hours throwing a football through a swinging automobile tire, often on the run. Baugh practiced punting more than throwing.

However, he really wanted to become a professional baseball player and almost received a scholarship to play at Washington State University. About a month before he started at Washington State, however, Baugh hurt his knee while sliding into second base during a game, and the scholarship fell through.

==College career==
===Football===
After coach Dutch Meyer told him he could play three sports (football, baseball, and basketball), Baugh attended Texas Christian University. While at TCU, he threw 587 passes in his three varsity seasons for 39 touchdowns. Baugh was named an All-American in 1935 and 1936. He also led the Horned Frogs to two bowl game wins, a 3–2 victory over LSU in the 1936 Sugar Bowl, and a 16–6 victory over Marquette in the first annual Cotton Bowl Classic in 1937 after which he was named MVP. He finished fourth in voting for the Heisman Trophy in 1936.

In early 1936, Washington Redskins owner George Preston Marshall offered Baugh $4,000 to play for them. Originally unsure about playing professional football, he did not agree to the contract until after the College All-Star Game, where the team beat the Green Bay Packers 6–0.

===Baseball===
Baugh was also a baseball player at TCU, where he played third base. It was during his time as a baseball player that he earned the nickname &quot;Slinging Sammy&quot;, which he got from a Texas sportswriter. After college, Baugh signed a contract with the St. Louis Cardinals and was sent to the minor leagues to play with the American Association Columbus Red Birds, after being converted to shortstop. He was then sent to the International League&#x27;s Rochester, New York Red Wings, St. Louis&#x27;s other top farm club. While there he received little playing time behind starting shortstop Marty Marion and was unhappy with his prospects. He then turned to professional football.

==Professional career==

As expected, Baugh was selected in the first round (sixth overall) of the 1937 NFL draft by the Washington Redskins, the same year the team moved from Boston. He signed a one-year contract with the Redskins and received $8,000, making him the highest-paid player on the team.

During his rookie season in 1937, Baugh played quarterback (although in Washington&#x27;s formation he was officially lined up as a tailback or halfback until 1944), safety, and punter, set an NFL record for completions with 91 in 218 attempts and threw for a league-high 1,127 yards. He led the Redskins to the NFL Championship game against the Chicago Bears, where he finished 17 of 33 for 335 yards and his second-half touchdown passes of 55, 78 and 33 yards gave Washington a 28–21 victory. His 335 passing yards remained the most ever in a playoff game by any rookie quarterback in NFL history until Russell Wilson broke the record in 2012. The Redskins and Bears met three times in championship games between 1940 and 1943. In the 1940 Championship game, the Bears recorded the most one-sided victory in NFL history, beating Washington 73–0. After the game, Baugh was asked what would have happened if the Redskins&#x27; first drive had resulted in a touchdown. He shrugged and replied: &quot;What? The score would have been 73–7&quot;.

Baugh&#x27;s heyday came during World War II. In 1942, Baugh and the Redskins won the East Conference with a 10–1 record. In the 1942 Championship game, Baugh threw a touchdown pass and kept the Bears in their own territory with some strong punts, including an 85-yard quick kick, and Washington won 14–6.

Baugh had what many consider to be the greatest single-season performance by a pro football player during 1943 in which he led the league in pass completions, punting (45.9-yard average) and interceptions (11). One of Baugh&#x27;s more memorable single-game performances during the season was when he threw four touchdown passes and intercepted four passes in a 42–20 victory over the Lions. He was selected as an All-Pro tailback that year. The Redskins again made it to the championship game, but lost to the Bears 41–21. During the game, Baugh suffered a concussion while tackling Bears quarterback Sid Luckman and had to leave.

During the 1945 season, Baugh completed 128 of 182 passes for a 70.33 completion percentage, which was an NFL record that lasted until being broken by Ken Anderson in 1982. He threw 11 touchdown passes and only four interceptions. The Redskins again won the East Conference but lost 15–14 in the 1945 Championship game against the Cleveland Rams. The one-point margin of victory came under scrutiny because of a safety that occurred early in the game. In the first quarter, the Redskins had the ball at their own 5-yard line. Dropping back into the end zone, Baugh threw to an open receiver, but the ball hit the goal post (which at the time was on the goal line instead of at the back of the end zone) and bounced back to the ground in the end zone. Under the rules at the time, this was ruled as a safety and thus gave the Rams a 2–0 lead. It was that safety that proved to be the margin of victory. Owner Marshall was so angry at the outcome that he became a major force in passing the following major rule change after the season: A forward pass that strikes the goal posts is automatically ruled incomplete. This later became known as the &quot;Baugh/Marshall Rule&quot;.

One of Baugh&#x27;s more memorable single performances came on &quot;Sammy Baugh Day&quot; on November 23, 1947. That day, the Washington D.C. Touchdown Club honored him at Griffith Stadium and gave him a station wagon. Against the Chicago Cardinals he passed for 355 yards and six touchdowns. That season, the Redskins finished 4–8, but Baugh had career highs in completions (210), attempts (354), yards (2,938) and touchdown passes (25), leading the league in all four categories.

Baugh played for five more years—leading the league in completion percentage for the sixth and seventh times in 1948 and 1949. He then retired after the 1952 season. In his final game, a 27–21 win over Philadelphia at Griffith Stadium, he played for several minutes before retiring to a prolonged standing ovation from the crowd. Baugh won numerous NFL passing titles and earned first-team All-NFL honors four times in his career. He completed 1,693 of 2,995 passes for 21,886 yards.

===Records===

By the time he retired, Baugh set 13 NFL records in three player positions: quarterback, punter, and safety. He is considered one of the all-time great football players. He gave birth to the fanaticism of Redskins fans. As Michael Wilbon of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; says: &quot;He brought not just victories but thrills and ignited Washington with a passion even the worst Redskins periods can barely diminish&quot;. He was the first to play the position of quarterback as it is played today, the first to make of the forward pass an effective weapon rather than an &quot;act of desperation&quot;.

Two of his records as quarterback still stand: most seasons leading the league in passing (six; tied with Steve Young) and most seasons leading the league with the lowest interception percentage (five). He is also top 20 all-time in highest single-season completion percentage (70.33), he has the most seasons leading the league in yards gained (four) and most seasons leading the league in completion percentage (seven).

As a punter, Baugh retired with the NFL record for highest punting average in a career (45.1 yards), and is still second all-time (only Shane Lechler has passed him with 46.5 yards), and has the second-best (51.4 in 1940) and fifth-best (48.7 in 1941) season marks. He led the league in punting from 1940 through 1943. His single-season record of 51.4 average yards per punt during the 1940 season was held for 82 seasons until Titans rookie punter Ryan Stonehouse broke it with a 53.1 average in the 2022 season.

As a safety, he was the first player in league history to intercept four passes in a game (in 1943; a record that has since been tied but not surpassed), and he is the only player to lead the league in passing, punting, and interceptions in the same season (also 1943).

As one of the best-known of the early NFL quarterbacks, Baugh is likely to be compared to more recent great players. As noted by Michael Wilbon in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the football of Baugh&#x27;s era was rounder at the ends and fatter in the middle than the one used today, making it far more difficult to pass well (or even to create a proper spiral). Additionally, it is important to point out that the rules for both pass-interference and for protecting quarterbacks have intensified dramatically, resulting in inflating modern quarterbacks&#x27; statistics.

==Coaching career==
While playing for the Redskins, Baugh and teammate Wayne Millner were assistant coaches for the Catholic University Cardinals, and went with them to the 1940 Sun Bowl. Baugh left Washington, D.C. in 1952. He chose not to return for Redskins team functions, despite repeated organization invitations. After his playing career, he became head football coach for the Hardin–Simmons Cowboys, where he compiled a 23–28 record between 1955 and 1959.

Baugh was the first coach of the New York Titans of the American Football League (AFL) in 1960 and 1961 compiling a record of 14–14. He was an assistant for the Tulsa Golden Hurricane in 1963 under head coach Glenn Dobbs. At Tulsa, he coached All-American quarterback Jerry Rhome. In 1964, Baugh coached the Houston Oilers and went 4–10.

==Acting==
Baugh also took up acting. In 1941, he made $6,400 for starring in a 12-week serial as a dark-haired Texas Ranger named Tom King. The serial, called &quot;King of the Texas Rangers&quot;, was released by Republic Studios. The episodes ran in theaters as Saturday matinees; it also starred Duncan Renaldo, later famous as TV&#x27;s Cisco Kid.

Robert Duvall patterned the role of Gus McCrae in the television series &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; after Baugh, particularly his arm movements, after visiting him at his home in Texas in 1988.

==Personal and later life==
After retiring from football, Baugh and his wife Edmonia Smith Baugh moved to his Double Mountain ranch west of Aspermont, Texas, where they had four boys and a girl. Edmonia died in 1990, after 52 years of marriage to Baugh, who was her high school sweetheart. According to his son, Baugh derived far more pleasure from ranching than he ever had from football, saying that he enjoyed the game, but if he could live his life over again, he probably wouldn&#x27;t play sports at all.

Similar to the nicknaming of fellow football great Byron &quot;Whizzer&quot; White of Colorado, sportswriters had tagged &quot;Slinging Sammy&quot;. However, Sam was his preferred name for most of his life. He always introduced himself as Sam Baugh and signed his papers and autographs that way. TCU named its football practice facility the Sam Baugh Football Center with that perspective in mind.

Baugh&#x27;s health began to decline after the death of his wife. During his last years, he lived in a nursing home in a little West Texas town called Jayton, not far from Double Mountain Ranch. The ranch is now in the hands of Baugh&#x27;s son David and is still a cow-calf operation, on .

===Death===
The Associated Press quoted Baugh&#x27;s son on December 17, 2008, saying Baugh had died after numerous health issues, including Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, at Fisher County Hospital in Rotan, Texas. He is interred at Belvieu Cemetery in Rotan.

<doc id="735306" wikidata="Q1467675" url="?curid=735306" title="Mercury-Redstone BD">
<text>Mercury-Redstone BD was an uncrewed booster development flight in the U.S. Mercury program. It was launched on March 24, 1961, from Launch Complex 5 at Cape Canaveral, Florida. The mission used a boilerplate Mercury spacecraft and Redstone MRLV-5.

After the problems that developed during the MR-2 mission carrying the chimpanzee Ham, it was apparent that the Redstone needed further development before it could be trusted to carry a human passenger.

Dr. Wernher von Braun added Mercury-Redstone BD (&quot;Booster Development&quot;) to the launch schedule between the MR-2 and MR-3 missions. This went over the protests of some, including astronaut Alan Shepard, who argued that the problems on MR-2 had been quickly identified and easily fixed. Von Braun was adamant that the Redstone could not be considered man-rated until a perfect test flight and that the launch vehicle performance on MR-1A and MR-2 had not met acceptable standards for carrying a human passenger.

The cause of previous Redstone rocket over-accelerations was a servo valve that did not properly regulate the flow of hydrogen peroxide to the steam generator. This in turn overpowered the fuel pumps. The thrust regulator and velocity integrator were modified on the MR-BD and later Mercury-Redstone rockets to prevent them from exceeding the speed limit again. Other modifications were made to prevent engine cutoff from propellant depletion rather than a programmed signal, which had led to an inadvertent abort and Launch Escape System (LES) activation on MR-2.

Another problem encountered in previous Mercury-Redstone flights were harmonic vibrations induced by aerodynamic stress in the topmost section of the elongated Redstone. To fix this problem, four stiffeners were added to the ballast section and of insulation was applied to the inner skin of the upper part of the Mercury Redstone instrument compartment.

The mission used a boilerplate Mercury spacecraft with an inert escape rocket. The spacecraft also did not have a retro package or posigrade rockets.

The MR-BD mission lasted eight minutes and 23 seconds. It reached an apogee of and a range of . The peak velocity was .
The spacecraft experienced a peak load of 11 &quot;g&quot; (108 m/s²). There was no intention to separate the Redstone rocket and boilerplate Mercury spacecraft and they impacted together downrange, short of the plan. They sank to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, exploding a sofar bomb en route. Booster performance was excellent other than some vibration issues in the adapter area.

MR-BD was highly successful and led the way to the flight of Alan Shepard aboard MR-3.

==Trivia==
In the USSR, the mission was erroneously recognized as failure:

<text>Keppel Island () is one of the Falkland Islands, lying between Saunders and Pebble islands, and near Golding Island to the north of West Falkland on Keppel Sound. It has an area of and its highest point, Mt. Keppel, is high. There is a wide, flat valley in the centre of the island with several freshwater lakes. The central valley rises steeply to the south-west, west and north. The north-east is low-lying, with a deeply indented coastline.

The large population of Norway rats on the island constitute an invasive species. They are predators of birds that nest there, of which several species are of conservation interest.

==History==
Early British settlers named the island after Admiral Augustus Keppel, First Lord of the Admiralty in the 18th century.

An Anglican missionary settlement set up in the mid-19th century served some Yaghan people brought there from Tierra del Fuego. They taught them farming and English, and some of the British party learned Yamana (or Yahgan). In 1885, the island was developed by European immigrants for sheep farming.

In the late 20th century, the island was designated as a nature reserve. It has a small settlement on the east coast, but no permanent population.

===Missionary station===
The mission on Keppel Island was established in 1855 by the South American Missionary Society (then the Patagonian Mission Society), initially under Captain William Parker Snow. It operated until 1898. Captain Allen Gardiner, founder of the society, had proposed use of this island, as a less hostile climate and environment than Tierra del Fuego, from which missionaries could gain the confidence of the Yaghan and learn their language.

From 1856, Anglican missionaries persuaded several Yaghan to move from Tierra del Fuego to Keppel Island, where they learnt farming techniques and some English. The Yahgan did not go to Keppel Island until a few years after the British built &quot;Cranmer Station&quot; near Committee Bay, named for Thomas Cranmer, the Protestant martyr. One of the more notable visitors to Cranmer Station (in 1860) was Jemmy Button, a Yahgan who had learnt English and was taken to England as a visitor with two other Yahgans aboard in 1830–31, on its first return trip.

After some setbacks, the mission succeeded in 1869 in founding another mission on Tierra del Fuego, at Ushuaia near the Beagle Canal, under the leadership of Waite Stirling, who later became a bishop in the region. Thomas Bridges was a young Anglican missionary who started there in 1871, having already learned the Yahgan language while on Keppel Island. He became fluent, and over a decade, wrote a Yámana grammar and dictionary containing 30,000 words. It was considered valuable for ethnological study of the people.

Today, the mission bailiff&#x27;s house, the chapel, and the stone walls of some of the Yaghan dwellings remain intact on Keppel Island. Some stone walls have been used to provide foundations for present-day buildings. The ruins are listed buildings and represent amongst the oldest in the islands.

==Important bird area==
Keppel Island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). Birds for which the site is of conservation significance include Falkland steamer ducks, ruddy-headed geese, gentoo penguins (1250 breeding pairs) southern rockhopper penguins (780 pairs), Magellanic penguins, black-browed albatrosses (1800 pairs) and white-bridled finches.

<doc id="735314" wikidata="Q762853" url="?curid=735314" title="All-America">
<text>The All-America designation is an annual honor bestowed on outstanding athletes in the United States who are considered to be among the best athletes in their respective sport. Individuals receiving this distinction are typically added to an All-America team for their sport. Some sports have multiple All-America teams, and list the honorees as members of a first team, second team, or third team. 

All-America teams are composed of outstanding U.S. amateur athletes. Individuals falling short of qualifying for the honor may receive All-America honorable mention. The designation is typically used at the collegiate level, although, beginning in 1957, high school athletes in football began being honored with All-American status, which then carried over to other sports like basketball and cross-country running. The selection criteria vary by sport. Athletes at the high school and college level placed on All-America teams are referred to as &quot;All-Americans.&quot;

==Term usage==
Individuals earn All-America honors in their sport either by athletic achievement at a championship event or by being selected by members of the national media, coaches&#x27; association, or through a poll. The All-American terminology is primarily a demonym and is often used with regard to college and occasionally to high school players in the United States and its territories.

Selection to an All-America team for collegiate (or high-school) players, however, is honorary in nature. Likewise, there may also be a lower-tiered accolade referred to as &quot;honorable mention&quot; that is conferred upon non-team members of similar caliber in the same class. &quot;All-America teams&quot; do not typically play any games as a unit, unlike many of the all-star teams.

The original use of the term &quot;All-America&quot; seems to have been in reference to a list of college football players who were regarded as the best at their respective positions. The first &quot;All-America&quot; team was the 1889 College Football All-America Team selected by Caspar Whitney and published in &quot;This Week&#x27;s Sports&quot; in association with Walter Camp.

In triathlons, USA Triathlon bestows the All America status on the top 10% within their age group.

The term has also been used in athletics in new ways to recognize the academic achievements of student-athletes as &quot;Academic All-America&quot; teams are named. The term &quot;Academic All-America&quot; is a registered trademark of the College Sports Information Directors of America, which began the program in 1952 to recognize college athletes at all levels of competition and in all collegiate sports.

==Collegiate sports==
Each year different sets of All-American teams are recognized toward consensus and unanimous selection recognition. A &quot;unanimous selection&quot; is a player who is listed as a first team All-American by all recognized lists. A &quot;consensus All-American&quot; is a player who is listed as a first team All-American by at least half of the recognized lists. All-America teams are selected annually in various collegiate sports.

===Archery===
In collegiate archery competitions All-America selections are determined by the US Collegiate Archery (USCA) association. All-American honors are awarded for Olympic Recurve, Compound Target, and Bowhunter divisions. All-American honors are awarded to the top 10 archers in each division based on aggregate scores from the National Indoor and Intercollegiate Championships each year.

===Baseball===

In baseball, All-America teams are selected annually by the American Baseball Coaches Association and &quot;Collegiate Baseball&quot;.

===Basketball===
In Division I men&#x27;s basketball, the National Collegiate Athletic Association recognizes consensus All-America teams via a points system, currently based on teams chosen by four entities: the Associated Press (AP), the National Association of Basketball Coaches, &quot;Sporting News&quot;, and the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA). Many other bodies and publications select their own All-America teams.

In Division I women&#x27;s basketball, the NCAA recognizes unanimous first-team selections since 1995 based on selections from the AP, USBWA and Women&#x27;s Basketball Coaches Association.

===Cross country running===
Selections are administered by the U.S. Track &amp; Field and Cross Country Coaches Association (USTFCCCA). In Division I, the top 40 overall finishers at the national meet are all named to the All-America team. In Division III, as of 2017, the top 40 finishers garner All-American distinction (previously top 35). The student-athlete&#x27;s team must be a member of the USTFCCCA.

===Fencing===
Based on the NCAA Fencing Championships, the U.S. Fencing Coaches Association annually selects athletes for All-American first team, second team, third team, and honorable mention titles.

===Football===

The National Collegiate Athletic Association currently recognizes College Football All-America Teams selected by the Associated Press, American Football Coaches Association, Football Writers Association of America, &quot;Sporting News&quot;, and the Walter Camp Football Foundation (WCFF) to determine consensus All-Americans.

===Golf===
All-American honors are awarded by the GCAA for men&#x27;s golf.

===Gymnastics===
In NCAA men&#x27;s gymnastics, all American status is awarded to the top 8 finishers in the national championship.

===Ice hockey===

The American Hockey Coaches Association (AHCA) selects All-Americans at the Division I and Division III levels, for both men and women. For Division I men, they select a first- and a second-team for East and for West; for Division I women, they select national first- and second-teams. For Division III men, they select a first- and a second-team for East and for West; for Division III women, they select a first and second team for both East and West.

===Lacrosse===
The United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) annually selects men&#x27;s lacrosse All-Americans, distinguished by first team, second team, third team, and honorable mention.

The Intercollegiate Women&#x27;s Lacrosse Coaches Association (IWLCA) annually selects women&#x27;s lacrosse All-Americans, distinguished by first team, second team, third team, and honorable mention.

US Lacrosse, the national governing body for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse, annually selects national boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; high school All-Americans.

===Rowing===
The American Collegiate Rowing Association (ACRA) and Collegiate Rowing Coaches of America (CRCA) name All-American teams for men and women respectively.

===Rugby union===
The term &quot;All-America&quot; was used for the student rugby teams that toured Australia in 1912 and New Zealand in 1913, see Rugby union in the United States.

===Sailing===
The Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association (ICSA) selects All-American teams annually at the end of every full racing season. The selected sailors are then inducted into the ICSA Hall of Fame.

===Soccer===
In soccer, United Soccer Coaches (formerly known as the National Soccer Coaches Association of America, or NSCAA) annually names an eleven-member All-America team, as well as Division I women, and Division II and III teams.

===Swimming and diving===
In NCAA swimming and diving, athletes and relay teams who make the championship final (top eight) are considered First-Team All-Americans. Athletes and relay teams that qualify for the consolation final (determines places 9–16) are considered Honorable Mention All-Americans. All-American teams are selected by the College Swimming Coaches Association of America (CSCAA).

===Tennis===
The Intercollegiate Tennis Association annually selects men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s D-1 players with the following criteria SINGLES (denoted by &#x27;S&#x27;) 1.) Top 16 seed in NCAA Singles Championships, or 2.) Reach round of 16 in NCAA Singles Championships, or 3.) Finish in the Top 20 of the final ITA Rankings. DOUBLES (denoted by &#x27;D&#x27;) 1.) Top eight seed in NCAA Doubles Championships, or 2.) Reach quarterfinals of NCAA Doubles Championship, or 3.) Finish in Top 10 of final ITA Rankings.

===Track and field===
Administered by the U.S. Track &amp; Field and Cross Country Coaches Association, the selection rule differs for NCAA Division I compared to NCAA Division II, Division III, NJCAA and NAIA. For all categories, the top eight finishers in each individual event are awarded First-Team All-America designation, while Division I athletes placed ninth through sixteenth are awarded Second-Team. Relays are judged strictly on a top-eight basis. The cutoffs are the same for both indoor and outdoor competition. The student-athlete&#x27;s team must be a member of the USTFCCCA, and relay members must run in the finals to earn All-America status.

In AIAW track and field before women&#x27;s sports were added to the NCAA, All-America certificates were awarded to the top six athletes at the national outdoor or indoor championships per event.

===Volleyball===
The American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA) selects five NCAA All-America teams. In women&#x27;s volleyball, it selects teams for all three NCAA divisions. In the men&#x27;s game, teams are chosen in the National Collegiate division (which includes members of Division I and Division II) and in Division III. The AVCA also selects teams for the NAIA, USCAA and NCCAA.

===Wrestling===

In all NCAA, NAIA, NJCAA, NCWA, and CCCAA divisions, the top 6 or 8 placers at the national championship tournament are considered All-Americans.

==High school sports==

<doc id="735315" wikidata="Q6519231" url="?curid=735315" title="2004 Leicester South by-election">
<text>A by-election was held for the United Kingdom Parliament seat of [[Leicester South (UK Parliament constituency)|Leicester South]] on 15 July 2004. It was triggered by the death of Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) Jim Marshall, who died on 27 May 2004, shortly before the local and European elections in June. The by-election was won by Parmjit Singh Gill of the Liberal Democrats, over-turning a Labour majority of 13,243 votes at the 2001 general election.

This by-election was held on the same day as the Birmingham Hodge Hill by-election, which Labour won with a highly reduced majority of just 460 votes (2.3%).

==Background==
Leicester South was first won by Jim Marshall of the Labour Party in 1974. He lost the seat to the Conservative Party candidate, Derek Spencer, in the 1983 general election by a mere 7 votes, but won it back at the 1987 election. Marshall won the constituency with a majority of 13,243 (31.4%) at the 2001 election.

The constituency is diverse, covering leafy suburbs such as Stoneygate and Knighton along with inner city areas with a strong South Asian community, one of the largest such populations in the UK. The by-election was considered a referendum on Blair&#x27;s policies, especially the ongoing Iraq War, for which Labour had received heavy backlash from Asian and Muslim voters. The war had also been blamed for the party&#x27;s major losses in the local elections of both 2003 and 2004. Jim Marshall had opposed the war prior to his death.

==Candidates==
The Labour Party chose Peter Soulsby to fight the by-election. Soulsby had previously been head of Leicester City Council for 18 years and also acted as the election agent for Jim Marshall at the 2001 general election.

The Liberal Democrats selected Parmjit Singh Gill, who was a councillor on Leicester City Council&#x27;s Stoneygate Ward and had also been the Leicester South candidate at the 2001 general election. He claimed his central issues would be &quot;Iraq, top-up fees, health and schools&quot; and that he would &quot;be a local MP who will work hard for everyone in our area.&quot;

Chris Heaton-Harris was announced as the Conservative candidate, despite having only recently been elected as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the East Midlands. Soulsby criticised this, telling &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;Leicester South needs a full-time local champion, not a two-jobs who doesn&#x27;t even live here and who can&#x27;t make up his mind whether he wants to be in Brussels or Westminster.&quot;

Yvonne Ridley, a former journalist who was held in captivity in Afghanistan by the Taliban and later converted to Islam, stood for the Respect Party. &quot;I&#x27;m not just fighting this seat to compete,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#x27;m fighting it to win, and I believe we can win.&quot;

Bob Ball was chosen to stand for the Green Party, but later withdrew. The Greens said that they were short of money after the European Parliament elections and wanted to concentrate resources on the next general election.

==Results==







In his victory speech, Gill said, &quot;Yesterday, Lord Butler gave his views on Tony Blair&#x27;s reasoning for backing the invasion of Iraq. Today, people in Leicester have given theirs.&quot; He then went on to say, &quot;The justification which Tony Blair gave for backing George Bush was wrong. The people of Leicester South have spoken for the people of Britain. Their message is that the prime minister has abused and lost their trust. He should apologise and he should apologise now.&quot;

Labour MP and cabinet minister Patricia Hewitt, who represented neighbouring constituency Leicester West, stated that Iraq was clearly an issue, with the inner city Asian vote swinging decisively to the Lib Dems.

At the 2005 general election, the Liberal Democrats lost the seat to Labour and Peter Soulsby became the new MP for Leicester South.

<text>Hiram Bingham II (August 16, 1831 – October 25, 1908) was a Protestant Christian missionary to Hawaii and the Gilbert Islands.

==Life and career==
Born in Honolulu, Bingham was the sixth child of early missionary Hiram Bingham I (1789–1869) and Sybil Moseley Bingham (1792–1848). Both father and mother sailed from Boston, Massachusetts, to Honolulu in 1819. Only ten years old in 1840, Bingham was sent to the United States with his siblings Elizabeth Kaahumanu (1829–1899) and Lydia Bingham (1834–1915) to attend school. Bingham was enrolled at Williston Seminary in Easthampton, Massachusetts, and graduated from Yale University in 1853.

Bingham was ordained a Congregationalist minister in New Haven, Connecticut, on November 9, 1856. Nine days later on November 18, Bingham married Clara Brewster (1834-1903) in Northampton, Massachusetts. The newlyweds arrived in Honolulu on April 24, 1857, where they both ministered to the native Hawaiians as part of American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. They eventually traveled and spread Christianity in several Pacific Ocean island communities, notably at the end of 1857 at the Gilbert Islands.

After a brief return to the United States in 1865, they arrived in Honolulu on March 13, 1867, for a stopover en route to the Marquesas Islands. They went through Micronesia and returned to Honolulu again in 1868. There they settled. Bingham was the first to translate the Bible into Gilbertese, and wrote several hymn books, dictionaries and commentaries in the language of the Gilbert Islands.

From 1877 to 1880, Bingham served as Secretary of the Hawaiian Board and in 1895, Yale University awarded him the Doctorate of Divinity. He died October 25, 1908, in Baltimore, Maryland.

Bingham&#x27;s son, Hiram Bingham III, was an explorer who made public the existence of the Inca citadel of Machu Picchu in 1911 with the guidance of local indigenous farmers and later became a US Senator and (briefly) Governor of Connecticut. His grandson, Hiram Bingham IV, was the US Vice Consul in Marseille, France, during World War II who rescued Jews from the Holocaust. Another grandson, Jonathan Brewster Bingham, was a long-time Reform Democratic Congressman from The Bronx from the mid-1960s through the early 1980s.

<doc id="735324" wikidata="Q2916179" url="?curid=735324" title="Converse accident">
<text>The fallacy of converse accident is an informal fallacy that occurs when a rule that applies only to an exceptional case is wrongly applied to all cases in general.

==Example==

# The Tunguska explosion happened in Siberia.
# Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works is in Siberia.
# This is a bad company to invest in because it&#x27;s just going to be destroyed by a meteorite.

&quot;If we allow people with glaucoma to use medical marijuana, then everyone should be allowed to use marijuana.&quot;

# People with glaucoma use marijuana.
# People with glaucoma should be allowed to choose what substances they use.
# Therefore, all people who use marijuana should be allowed to choose what substances they use.

==Related fallacies==
This fallacy is similar to the slippery slope, where the opposition claims that if a restricted action under debate is allowed, such as allowing people with glaucoma to use medical marijuana, then the action will by stages become acceptable in general, such as eventually everyone being allowed to use marijuana. The two arguments imply there is no difference between the exception and the rule, and in fact fallacious slippery slope arguments often use the converse accident to the contrary as the basis for the argument. However, a key difference between the two is the point and position being argued. The above argument using converse accident is an argument &quot;for&quot; full legal use of marijuana given that glaucoma patients use it. The argument based on the slippery slope argues &quot;against&quot; medicinal use of marijuana because it will lead to full use.

The fallacy of converse accident is a form of hasty generalization. The converse form is known as the fallacy of accident.

<doc id="735328" wikidata="Q215305" url="?curid=735328" title="Giulio Romano">
<text>Giulio Pippi ( – 1 November 1546), known as Giulio Romano and Jules Romain ( , ; ), was an Italian Renaissance painter and architect. He was a pupil of Raphael, and his stylistic deviations from High Renaissance classicism help define the sixteenth-century style known as Mannerism. Giulio&#x27;s drawings have long been treasured by collectors; contemporary prints of them engraved by Marcantonio Raimondi were a significant contribution to the spread of sixteenth-century Italian style throughout Europe.

== Biography ==
Giulio Pippi was born in Rome and he began his career there as a young assistant to the leading painter and architect Raphael. He became an important member of Raphael&#x27;s large team working on the frescos in the Raphael Rooms and Vatican loggias using designs by Raphael and, later painting a group of figures in the &quot;Fire in the Borgo&quot; fresco. He also collaborated on the decoration of the ceiling of the Villa Farnesina. Despite his relative youth, increasingly he became indispensable to the master and after the death of Raphael in 1520, he took a leading role in completing the Vatican commissions, designing the frescoes of the life of Constantine as well as completing Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot; and the &quot;Transfiguration&quot; in the Vatican. In Rome, Giulio decorated the Villa Madama for Cardinal Giuliano de&#x27; Medici, afterward Clement VII. The crowded frescoes he designed lack the stately and serene simplicity of his master.

On Raphael&#x27;s death, Michelangelo attempted to take over completion of the commission for the Raphael Rooms at the Vatican, but along with Perino del Vaga, Giulio was able to keep it, as they had the drawings for much of the uncompleted work that was being executed under the supervision of Raphael.

From 1522 he was courted by Federico Gonzaga, ruler of Mantua, who wanted him as court artist, apparently especially attracted by his skill as an architect. The contemporaneous historian of the Renaissance, Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574), tells how Baldassare Castiglione was delegated by Gonzaga to procure Giulio to execute paintings as well as architectural and engineering projects for the duchy of Mantua. In late 1524, Giulio agreed to move to Mantua, where he remained for the rest of his life. In Mantua, rather than his given name, &quot;Giulio Romano&quot; was used to identify him by his geographical origin because he was not a native artist. Mantua is where he executed his most well-known work, hence that name became associated with him thereafter. His move to Mantua meant he escaped the disaster of the Sack of Rome in 1527, which hugely disrupted artistic patronage in Rome and dispersed the remainder of Raphael&#x27;s workshop.

His masterpiece of architecture and fresco painting in Mantua is the suburban Palazzo Te, with its famous illusionistic frescos (–1535) and his use of the Palladian motif for arches used in the design. He also helped rebuild the ducal palace in Mantua, reconstructed the cathedral, and designed the nearby Church of San Benedetto. Giulio sculpted the figure of Christ that is positioned above Castiglione&#x27;s tomb in the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, in Curtatone, near Mantua. Sections of Mantua that had been flood-prone were refurbished under Giulio&#x27;s direction and the duke&#x27;s patronage and friendship never faltered. The studio he established in Mantua became a popular school of art. Giulio&#x27;s annual income amounted to more than 1000 ducats.

In Italian Renaissance tradition, many works by Giulio were only temporary. According to Vasari:


He traveled to France in the first half of the sixteenth century and brought concepts of the Italian style to the French court of Francis I.

Giulio designed tapestries as well. It also is rumored that he contributed to a collection of drawings upon which a group entitled, &quot;I Modi&quot;, was engraved by Marcantonio Raimondi. All of those original drawings are said to have been destroyed because the content was no longer considered socially acceptable.

Giulio Romano has the distinction of being the only Renaissance artist to be mentioned by William Shakespeare. In Act V, Scene II of &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, the statue of Queen Hermione that was described as coming to life during the play was identified by the bard as having been sculpted by &quot;that rare Italian master, Julio Romano&quot;.

He died in Mantua in 1546. According to Vasari, his best pupils were Giovanni dal Lione, Raffaellino dal Colle, Benedetto Pagni, Figurino da Faenza, Giovanni Battista Bertani and his brother Rinaldo, and Fermo Guisoni.

== Architecture ==
On the whole, Giulio Romano was more influential as an architect than as a painter and his works had an enormous impact on Italian Mannerist architecture. He learned architecture the same way he learned painting, as an increasingly trusted assistant to Raphael, who was appointed the papal architect in 1514 and his early works are very much in Raphael&#x27;s style. The project for the Villa Madama outside Rome, built by the future Medici Pope Clement VII was given to Giulio on Raphael&#x27;s death. It already shows his taste for playful surprises within the style of Renaissance classical architecture. Planned on a huge scale, it was incomplete by the Sack of Rome, and never finished.

The Villa Lante al Gianicolo (1520–21) was a smaller suburban villa in Rome, with a famous view over the city. Romano made the whole building suggest lightness and elegance to exploit the ridge-top position and to overcome the rather small Roman footprint. The orders are delicate, with Tuscan or Doric columns and pilasters in pairs on the main floor, and extremely shallow Ionic pilasters above, whose presence is mainly conveyed by a different colour. Alternate loggia openings are heightened by arches above the entablature. Romano&#x27;s willingness to play with the conventions of the classical orders is already in evidence; the Doric here has guttae, but no triglyphs, on its narrow entablature. The volutes of the Ionic capitals are repeated in the window surrounds between them: &quot;The canonic orders here begin to be treated visually as independent from their structural purposes, and this liberation offered the architect new expressive possibilities.&quot;

His last building in Rome, the Palazzo Maccarani Stati (started 1522–23), was a considerable contrast, being a palazzo in the city centre, with shops on the ground floor, and a massive, imposing feel. The rustication and exaggerated size of keystones that were to be so prominent in his later buildings in Mantua, are already present on the ground floor, which dispenses with any classical order, but the two upper floors have increasingly shallow orders in pilasters, somewhat in the manner of the Villa Lante.

His first building in Mantua has remained his most famous work in architecture. The Palazzo del Te was a pleasure palace outside the city that was begun around 1524 and completed a decade later. Here Giulio was able, because of the function of the building, to indulge to the full his playful inventiveness.

*Vita by Giorgio Vasari, who describes his meeting with Giulio:
:&quot;At this time Giorgio Vasari a great friend of Giulio, though they only knew each other by report and by letters, passed through Mantua on his way to Venice to see him and his works. On meeting, they recognised each other as though they had met a thousand times before. Giulio was so delighted that he spent four days in showing Vasari all his works, especially the plans of ancient buildings at Rome, Naples, Pozzuolo, Campagna, and all the other principal antiquities designed partly by him and partly by others. Then, opening a great cupboard, he showed him plans of all the buildings erected from his designs in Mantua, Rome and all Lombardy, so beautiful that I do not believe that more original, fanciful or convenient buildings exist.&quot;

<text>Ukhta (; , &quot;Ukva&quot;) is an important industrial town in the Komi Republic of Russia. Population: 

It was previously known as &quot;Chibyu&quot; (until 1939).

==History==
Oil springs along the Ukhta River were already known in the 17th century. In the mid-19th century, industrialist M. K. Sidorov started to drill for oil in this area. It was one of the first oil wells in Russia. There was homecraft oil-field in 1920–1921 in Ukhta. Lying on the river of the same name, the settlement was founded as the village of Chibyu in 1929, but in 1939 it was renamed Ukhta. It was granted town status in 1943 when it was linked to the Pechora Railway. To the east of the town is Sosnogorsk, and to the southwest—Yarega. In addition to its rail link, Ukhta also has an airport.

The town expanded in the 1940s and 1950s by use of political prisoners&#x27; forced labor (see: gulag).

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with four urban-type settlements (Borovoy, Vodny, Shudayag, and Yarega) and thirteen rural localities, incorporated as the town of republic significance of Ukhta—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of republic significance of Ukhta is incorporated as Ukhta Urban Okrug.

==Economy==
Ukhta lies within the Timan-Pechora Basin, an important oil and gas-producing region. The oilfields lie just south of the city. Some of the Ukhta&#x27;s oil is refined locally; most, however, is piped to oil refineries between St. Petersburg and Moscow. There have been a few gas pipeline explosions at a distance of Eight kilometres (five miles) from the town since the 1990s.

==Climate==
Ukhta has a continental subarctic climate (Dfc) with long, very cold winters and short, warm summers. Compared with areas at a similar latitude in Siberia, winters are less extreme, but still much longer than summer and bitterly cold by European standards.

== Notable people ==
*Roman Abramovich, Russian businessman
*Dmitri Aliev, Olympic figure skater
*Aleksandr Chupriyan, Minister of Emergency Situations 
*Olga Fonda, actress
*Sergei Kapustin, hockey player
*Viktor Alexandrovič Lyapkalo, painter
*Eduard Rossel, Governor of Sverdlovsk Oblast
*Yulia Samoilova, Russian singer
*Alexander Sukhorukov, Olympic swimmer
*Arsen Pavlov, former commander of Donetsk Separatist militia &quot;Sparta Battalion&quot;

<doc id="735342" wikidata="Q435860" url="?curid=735342" title="M-5 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-5, commonly referred to as Grand River Avenue and the northern section as the Haggerty Connector, is a state trunkline highway in the Metro Detroit area of the US state of Michigan. The highway runs through suburbs in Oakland and Wayne counties in addition to part of Detroit itself. It starts in Commerce Township as a north–south divided highway and freeway called the Haggerty Connector and connects with Interstate 96 (I-96) in Novi. The freeway then turns southeasterly to bypass the suburb of Farmington as an east–west highway. The freeway ends on the southeast side of Farmington, and M-5 follows Grand River Avenue as a boulevard into Detroit. The eastern terminus is at the five-way intersection between Grand River Avenue, Cass Avenue, and Middle Street in Downtown Detroit, where it had been extended to in May 2016 from an interchange with I-96 on the northwest side of the city. The trunkline passes between suburban residential subdivisions and along urban commercial areas while serving 17,200–68,800 vehicles on average each day.

Grand River Avenue started as the path of an early wagon trail in the Michigan Territory, carrying settlers from Detroit inland along a route previously used by Native Americans. It was later a plank road that helped to connect Detroit with the state capital of Lansing and Grand Rapids. When the state highway system was signed in 1919, the avenue was numbered as part of M-16. Later it became US Highway 16 (US 16). Grand River Avenue was supposed to be the path for I-96 from Novi into downtown Detroit, and a section of freeway now used by M-5 was constructed as part of I-96 before the Interstate was rerouted to a different location. In the 1990s another section of freeway, which was originally proposed for a northern extension of I-275, was opened. This freeway called the Haggerty Connector was added to M-5. Additional projects have extended the highway farther north and added a roundabout to the northern terminus. A different highway was previously designated M-5 in another area of the state in the 1930s.

==Route description==
M-5 starts at a roundabout intersection with Pontiac Trail in Commerce Township. It runs south-southwesterly from here in Oakland County as a divided highway between suburban residential subdivisions in the township. South of Maple Road, the highway is bordered by commercial developments to the east and Long Park to the west as it angles southeasterly. Between 14 and 13 Mile roads, the highway is once again bounded by subdivisions. Along this part of the trunkline, access to the road is limited to major intersections only, making the highway an expressway. Immediately south of the 13 Mile Road intersection, M-5&#x27;s median widens out as the highway transitions to a full freeway called the Haggerty Connector. Traffic can only access the highway at grade-separated interchanges instead of at-grade intersections. A collector-distributor lane setup parallels the main freeway lanes providing access to the ramps at the 12 Mile Road interchange as well as ramps from the massive interchange with I-96, I-275 and I-696. Through this interchange complex that straddles the Novi–Farmington Hills city line, M-5 turns to the southeast, and signage changes direction. The Haggerty Connector is signed north–south, while the rest of M-5 is signed east–west. M-5 has direct connections with ramps to I-696 and I-96 east/I-275 south as it crosses over into Farmington Hills.
The next interchange for the M-5 freeway connects to Grand River Avenue and 10 Mile Road. This section of the freeway bypasses residential areas of Farmington Hills. Further east, M-5 crosses into Farmington where it bypasses the downtown area of the suburb. Past 9 Mile Road, the freeway ends at the intersection with Grand River Avenue, and M-5 follows Grand River southeasterly as a boulevard, a type of divided street. Traffic that wishes to make left turns must use a Michigan left maneuver along this section of the highway. Additionally, traffic that needs to change sides of the street must use crossovers in the median to perform a U-turn. Once again running through suburban Farmington Hills, the trunkline passes Botsford Hospital before intersecting 8 Mile Road. This intersection marks the place where M-5 crosses into Wayne County, and the western terminus of the M-102 designation on 8 Mile Road. Grand River Avenue runs through the northern section of Redford Township in Wayne County and crosses into Detroit at the intersection with 7 Mile Road and 5 Points Street.

The northwest corner of Detroit is mostly residential as M-5 intersects US 24 (Telegraph Road). Past Telegraph, Grand River Avenue forms the northern boundary of the Grand Lawn Cemetery and later the southern boundary of the New Rogell Golf Course. The properties bordering M-5 transition to commercial use past these two green spaces, and the highway continues southeasterly through the city as an undivided street. Grand River Avenue intersects Outer Drive near several businesses. M-5 crosses over M-39 (Southfield Freeway) near the intersection with Fenkell Street, which would be 5 Mile Road in the Detroit grid system. The residential areas off the adjacent side streets increase in density east of the Southfield Freeway. Although a few sources still indicate M-5 ending at the interchange with I-96 between Schoolcraft and Plymouth roads in the middle of another larger commercial zone; M-5 continues past this location along a portion of Grand River Avenue that until April–May 2016 was part of unsigned highway Old BS I-96. About a mile and three-quarters (2.8 km) along, M-5 crosses I-96 again near Livernois Avenue, and I-96 from here into the downtown area parallels Grand River Avenue. It passes Bishop Park near Grand Boulevard and then crosses I-94. In the North Corktown neighborhood, Grand River Avenue crosses M-10 (Lodge Freeway) near the MotorCity Casino. About a half mile (0.7 km) past M-10, M-5 crosses I-75 (Fisher Freeway) and enters Downtown Detroit&#x27;s Foxtown neighborhood. State maintenance ends at the five-way intersection between Grand River Avenue, Cass Avenue, and Middle Street. Grand River Avenue continues another five blocks to Woodward Avenue and another four blocks as it curves in an arc around Grand Circus Park.

M-5 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT&#x27;s surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-5 were the 68,793 vehicles daily between 12 and 13 Mile roads; the lowest counts were the 17,176 vehicles per day southeast of Schoolcraft Road to I-96. All of M-5 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility. The trunkline is six- or eight-lanes wide along the freeway section to the north and west of the Grand River Avenue interchange; south and east of there it is a four-lane freeway or five- or six-lane wide highway all the way to Cass Avenue.

==History==

===Previous designation===
Starting in 1933, M-5 was used as the designation along a section of highway that was previously part of US 2 in Mackinac and Chippewa counties in the Upper Peninsula. This designation was in use until 1939 when it was replaced by M-129.

===Current designation===

====Grand River Avenue====

The chief transportation routes in 1701 were the Indian trails that crossed the future state of Michigan; the Grand River Trail was one of these thirteen trails at the time. Detroit created rights-of-way for the principal streets of the city, Grand River Avenue included, in 1805. This street plan was devised by Augustus Woodward and others following a devastating fire in Detroit. A ten-year project to construct a plank road between Detroit and Howell was authorized in 1820 along the Grand River Trail. Grand River Avenue was included as one of Five Great Military Roads in 1825, along with the River Road, Michigan Avenue, Woodward Avenue and Gratiot Avenue. The Grand River Road, precursor to the modern Grand River Avenue was named by Benjamin Williams, cofounder of Owosso; it was named for &quot;La Grande Riviere&quot;, the French name for the river.

The opening of the Erie Canal in New York in 1826 brought new settlers to the Great Lakes region, and to the future state of Michigan. Many of these settlers began their inland journeys in Detroit. At first the Grand River Road was a &quot;deep rutted, ditch bordered road&quot;. The Grand River Road was a major route for settlers headed inland to Grand Rapids in 1836, as the shortest route for travelers coming from Detroit.

In 1850, the Michigan State Legislature established the Lansing and Howell Plank Road Company, which set about converting various Indian trails into the Lansing–Howell Plank Road, a task the company completed by 1853. At Howell the road connected with the Detroit–Howell Plank Road, establishing the first improved connection direct from the state capital to Michigan&#x27;s largest metropolis. The Lansing–Detroit Plank Road was a toll road until the 1880s. It eventually evolved into the eastern part of the modern Grand River Avenue.

By 1900, only a short stretch of the Detroit–Howell Plank Road was still made of planks; most of the other plank roads had been converted to gravel by this time. When the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) had numbered and signed highways in the state in 1919, it applied the M-16 number to Grand River Avenue across the state between Grand Haven and Detroit.

The M-16 designation lasted for seven years. As the states were meeting with the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO, now AASHTO) to plan the United States Numbered Highway System, the route of M-16 was originally planned to be included in US 18. When the system was announced on November 11, 1926, Grand River Avenue and M-16 became part of US 16. The first change to the US 16 routing in the Detroit area was made in 1933 when the highway was moved to bypass Farmington, with the old routing retained as a state highway.

====Metro Detroit freeways====

MSHD had plans to upgrade the US 16 corridor to freeway standards in the middle of the 20th century. The first planning map in 1947 for what later became the Interstate Highway System showed a highway in the corridor. The &quot;General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955&quot;, or &quot;Yellow Book&quot; after the cover color, showed generalized plans for the locations of Interstate Highways as designated in 1955. This also included a highway in the US 16 corridor. The 1957 approval for the Interstate Highway System replaced much of US 16 with a portion of Interstate 94 (I-94). MSHD submitted a recommended numbering plan for the Interstates in 1958 that showed I-96 following the US 16 corridor.

The segments of the road between Brighton and Farmington were upgraded in 1956. The MSHD initially signed the various freeways as Interstates in 1959, and US 16 through the Farmington area gained the additional I-96 numbering. Two years later, the business route through Farmington was redesignated as a business loop of I-96 instead of US 16. The final connection for I-96 between Lansing and Brighton was completed in late 1962, and the US 16 designation was decommissioned in the state. The sections of highway through the Detroit metro area were given Business Loop (BL) or Business Spur (BS) I-96 designations.
When I-96 was completed in 1977, several highway designations were shifted in the Metro Detroit area. The BS I-96 designation was removed from Grand River Avenue. Rather than revert to its original number, M-16, MDOT selected M-5 as the new highway designation. Grand River was signed as M-5 between 8 Mile Road and I-96 exit 185 while leaving Grand River Avenue southeast of I-96 an unsigned state trunkline, OLD BS I-96. Both the portion of BS I-96 north of 8 Mile Road and the stub of I-96 that continued out to I-275 became part of M-102. In 2016, as part of a street light replacement project along Grand River Avenue, M-5 trailblazers were installed along Grand River between its previous eastern terminus at I-96 exit 185 and Old BS I-96&#x27;s former eastern terminus in Downtown Detroit. New signage for M-10 exit 2C (serving Grand River Avenue) installed in 2018 included M-5 trailblazers, further cementing this extension.

====Haggerty Connector====
A freeway running north of Novi to the Davisburg area was included in the original Interstate Highway plans for Michigan. Originally included in the corridor for I-275, the Michigan Highway Commission canceled the northern section of the highway on January 26, 1977, after it spent $1.6 million (equivalent to $ in 2025) the year before purchasing land for the roadway. This northern section was not planned as an Interstate Highway at that time, bearing the designation M-275 instead. Opposition to construction came from various citizen&#x27;s groups and different levels of local government. Additionally, both &quot;The Detroit News&quot; and &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; opposed the project. The Detroit City Council, led by then-Chairman Carl Levin opposed the plan. Levin said at the time, &quot;At last I think people are waking up to the dangers of more and more expressways. At some point we&#x27;ve got to say enough. And I think we&#x27;ve reached it.&quot; The US Department of the Interior reviewed the state&#x27;s environmental impact study of the project and stated the project, &quot;will cause irreparable damages on recreation lands, wetlands, surface waters and wildlife habitat.&quot; The total project to link Farmington Hills with Davisburg with the freeway would have cost $69.5 million (equivalent to $ in 2025) and saved drivers an estimated eight minutes off travel time around the city of Detroit.

After many years of inactivity, further work began along this same route, but the resulting highway was designated as a northern extension of M-5 rather than I-275 or M-275. The first section of this freeway extension was opened in October 1994. This extended the route from M-5&#x27;s previous terminus at M-102 (8 Mile Road) over the latter highway&#x27;s alignment west and north to 12 Mile Road. A plan enacted by then Governor John Engler in 1995 angered road officials when funding was diverted from county road commissions to help complete state highway projects like the M-5 Haggerty Connector project. In 1999, a second extension of M-5 was completed to 14 Mile Road, but only as an expressway. The final between 14 Mile Road and Pontiac Trail opened to traffic on November 1, 2002. In 2011, a roundabout was placed at the northern terminus of M-5. This last project also included a northern extension of roadway into the Eldorado Golf Course in Commerce Township to better serve the community. This extension does not carry the M-5 designation.

<doc id="735348" wikidata="Q7190914" url="?curid=735348" title="Pickles (comic strip)">
<text>Pickles is a daily and Sunday comic strip by Brian Crane focusing on a retired couple in their seventies, Earl and Opal Pickles. &quot;Pickles&quot; has been published since April 2, 1990.

== Publication ==
As of 2016, &quot;Pickles&quot; was syndicated in close to 1,000 newspapers worldwide. 

In 2022, &quot;Pickles&quot; moved syndicates from The Washington Post Writers Group (which had previously announced it was shutting down its comic strip business) to Andrews McMeel Syndication.

==Story and characters==
Inspired by Crane&#x27;s in-laws, the strip describes their efforts to enjoy retirement, which instead proves quite imperfect for both. Earl Pickles is bald and has a bushy white mustache; he also wears glasses and suspenders. He is described as &quot;a couch potato, curmudgeon and all-around geezer-in-residence.&quot; Opal Pickles also wears glasses and is often seen wearing purple polka-dotted dresses and white sneakers. She is &quot;a devoted wife, mother, grandmother, Red Hat Lady and cat servant.&quot; When sitting, she is usually seen with her pet cat, Muffin, in her lap (on some occasions, Muffin tends to lie on Earl&#x27;s lap to his disdain). Both characters were drawn with their eye pupils visible through their glasses during the strip&#x27;s early years, but their glasses were later whitened so that they are opaque to readers.

The cast includes their dog, Roscoe; their cat, Muffin; their 6-year-old grandson, Nelson Wolfe; Nelson&#x27;s parentstheir daughter, Sylvia, and her husband, Dan, a wildlife photographer; Clyde, Earl&#x27;s friend; and Pearl, Opal&#x27;s sister, who dated Earl many years ago. Opal&#x27;s friend Emily also occasionally appears. Roscoe and Muffin are depicted with thought balloons (like Snoopy or Garfield) to express their personal views whenever they observe the daily routines of their humans or other incidents.

In the foreword to one of Crane&#x27;s &quot;Pickles&quot; books, Charles Schulz, creator of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic, stated, &quot;I think it would be very comforting to have Earl and Opal for neighbors.&quot;

==Awards and honors==
*In 2001, &quot;Pickles&quot; was named best newspaper comic strip of the year by the National Cartoonists Society. 
*In 2013, Brian Crane shared the Reuben Award with Rick Kirkman.

==Bibliography==
The strips have been collected in book form in: 
* &quot;Pickles&quot; (1998)
* &quot;Pickles, Too: The Older I Get, The Better I Was&quot; (1999)
* &quot;Still Pickled After All These Years&quot; (2002)
* &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Pickled!&quot; (2006)
* &quot;How Come I Always Get Blamed for the Things I Do?&quot; (2010)
* &quot;Oh Sure! Blame it on the Dog!&quot; (2013)

A 25th anniversary retrospective, &quot;25 Years of Pickles&quot;, was released by Baobab Press in 2015.

<text>Jeffrey Stafford (born June 13, 1967), known professionally as Bobby Conn, is an American musician based in Chicago, Illinois. He often collaborates with other artists and film-maker Usama Alshaibi. 

== Career ==
Conn was born as Jeffrey Stafford in New York, but spent much of his young life in the Chicago suburb of St. Charles. He started a hardcore punk trio in high school called &quot;The Broken Kockamamies&quot; (The BK&#x27;s, or BKS) who were noted for using eight-foot strobe lights on a darkened stage as their only prop. The strobes were affectionately called &quot;the pillars of fear.&quot;
In 1989, Conn played guitar in the Chicago avant garde rock quartet Conducent (Conn/guitar, Rex Jenny/bass and vocals, DeShawn/drums and vocals, Le Deuce/loops, beats, and atmosphere). The eclectic Conducent sound was born from improv and raised on the &quot;open mic&quot; circuit, eventually growing into full maturity as a performance troupe. Conn went solo in 1994 after Conducent broke up. His first lineup consisted of ex-Conducent member DJ Le Deuce on turntables, as well as his future wife Julie Pomerleau (a.k.a. Monica BouBou) on electric violin. Conn went on to release seven studio albums to date: &quot;Bobby Conn&quot; (1997), &quot;Rise Up!&quot; (1998), &quot;The Golden Age&quot; (2001), &quot;The Homeland&quot; (2004), &quot;King For A Day&quot; (2007), &quot;Macaroni&quot; (2012), and &quot;Recovery&quot; (2020), along with a live album &quot;Live Classics&quot; (2005) and an E.P. called &quot;Llovessonngs&quot; (1999).

In 2003, Conn produced a session for UK punk band the Cribs, whom he met when they were a support band on his UK tour. A part of that session was used on The Cribs&#x27; self-titled debut release in 2004.

== Bobby Conn and the press ==
From Bobby Conn&#x27;s Southern Records biography:
He developed the &quot;Continuous Ca$h Flow System&quot; while incarcerated in a federal facility in Maryland, serving out a sentence for mail fraud. In his solitude he was struck by two things: firstly, that his illegal difficulties were due to his focus on earning rather than spending as much money as possible, and more importantly, that he was likely to be the Anti-Christ. Bobby now knew that time was short, the coming Armageddon would destroy humanity at century&#x27;s end, so he had to reach people quickly. A natural performer and gifted musician in the popular tradition, he structured his &quot;Continuous Ca$h Flow System&quot; [...] Bobby knows that creating a financial vacuum inside oneself is the best way to fill a spiritual void, and he demonstrates this regularly by distributing thousands of dollars in the form of $20 bills to every audience member. But with his gift comes a desire. A desire to spend. And spend. And spend yet more, creating a glorious Debt that promises, if not salvation, a thrilling high-paced life-style. And when the collective Debt of our generation grows large enough, the entire Pig System of Oppression will be snuffed out like a candle in a hurricane.

In more recent years, Conn has been more candid in interviews, and has admitted that all of these early fabrications for the press were merely a charade. Conn told &quot;Magnet&quot; magazine that &quot;I always thought it was part of the creative process. Creativity is lying. My own story doesn&#x27;t seem very interesting to me [...] You don&#x27;t want to be who you are onstage everyday. What&#x27;s the point in that?&quot; Conn also said in interview with &quot;freq.org.uk&quot; that the source of his onstage persona was &quot;egomaniacal delusions that I&#x27;ve had since I was a kid – I tried to hyperbolize them to see how far it would go. To me when I came up with the whole idea of trying to promote myself as a potential Antichrist I figured that no-one is going to take this seriously or even acknowledge it because it&#x27;s about the dumbest thing you could say.&quot;

== Protest ==

Conn has said of his art that &quot;All the records that I&#x27;ve done are a critique of what&#x27;s going on in contemporary America&quot;, and he was an outspoken critic of the George W. Bush administration. However, Conn has admitted he was not always at ease with the &quot;protest singer&quot; label for himself. He told &quot;Magnet&quot; magazine, &quot;I&#x27;ve always done lots of social commentary that I believe in pretty strongly but I am very uncomfortable with the role of the artist as a meaningful social critic...my whole generation [is] a confused group of people with an ambivalent way of dealing with protest.&quot;

Regarding his 2007 album &quot;King for a Day&quot;, Conn said &quot;it&#x27;s political, but just in a contemporary culture kind of way[...] Two of the songs are about Tom Cruise, and I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a more political statement than Tom Cruise. He kind of symbolizes a lot of what&#x27;s going on in this country right now and how people are responding to it.&quot;

==Personal life==
He lives in the Chicago area with his wife, violinist and session musician Julie Pomerleau, and their two children.

In 2001, Conn and Pomerleau became the first couple who were cast by Cynthia Plaster Caster.

<text>The Jason Islands (Spanish: &quot;Islas Sebaldes&quot;) are an archipelago in the Falkland Islands, lying to the far north-west of West Falkland. Three of the islands, Steeple Jason, Grand Jason and Clarke&#x27;s Islet, are private nature reserves owned by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York City. Other islands in the group are National Nature Reserves owned by the Falkland Islands Government.

==Geography==

The islands include Steeple Island, Grand Island, Elephant Island, Flat Island and South Island.

*Steeple Jason Island runs south-east to north-west. A narrow neck of land breaks the island into two sections, both with steep slopes on both sides. The northern point has a wide low plateau which is an important area for breeding seabirds.
*Grand Island, the largest of the group, has a varied terrain with steep cliffs and high plateaux with gullies. There are tussac-covered slopes facing west and south, with severely eroded areas, especially at the northern, south-eastern and western ends. At higher levels, tussac is sparse and there are low grasses and small cushion plants.
*Steeple Islet is generally low-lying and slopes towards a rocky north-western point. It is almost completely covered in dense tussac grass.
*Flat Jason Island is low-lying.
*Elephant Jason Island has a long ridge with a maximum height of . On the western coast there are sheer cliffs; on the northern and eastern coasts, the land slopes into low-lying plateaux covered with dense tussac. The tussac extends around most of the island except at the most northerly point, where there are areas of grass and heath. Early in the 20th century it was used as a base for government sealing inspectors.
*South Jason Island has a central ridge with a high point about .
*South Fur Island, about off the south coast of South Jason Island, is notable for its dolerite boulders.
*North Fur lies east of Flat Jason. It has steep cliffs and has never been stocked, probably because access is difficult.
*Clarke&#x27;s Islet is about off the north-eastern coast of Grand Jason Island.
*The Fridays are two small, low-lying islands about off the north-west coast of Flat Jason.

The Spanish name for the archipelago is Islas Sebaldes; however, this is sometimes subdivided into &quot;Islas los Salvajes&quot; (western, Grand Jason, and Steeple Jason) and &quot;Islas las Llaves&quot; (eastern, Flat Jason, Seal Rocks and North Fur Island). No such distinction exists in English-language toponymy.

The Jason Islands are somewhat geologically distinct, described by Ian Strange as &quot;sharply rising peaks give them a grandeur found in few other areas of the archipelago&quot;.

==History==

An archipelago in the region of the Falkland Islands appeared on maps from the early 16th century prompting speculation they may have been sighted by Portuguese or Spanish sailors of the period, although none of the suggestions in the modern literature stand up to scrutiny. In 1592, John Davis is believed to have sighted the Falklands after drifting under bare masts in the Falklands Current its likely that he made an initial sighting of the Jason Islands.

On 24 January 1600 Sebald De Weert, on his homeward leg back to the Netherlands after having left the Straits of Magellan, noticed some islands that did not exist on his nautical charts. He attempted to stop and replenish there, but was unable to land due to harsh conditions. The islands that Sebald de Weert charted were the present day Jason Islands. De Weert named these islands the &quot;Sebald de Weert Eilanden&quot; (&quot;Sebald de Weert Islands&quot; in English), which came to be known to the world as the Sebald Islands. Since 1766, these have been officially known as the &quot;Jason Islands&quot;, in the Falklands and throughout the British Empire, although, the name &quot;Sebald Islands&quot; (or Spanish versions &quot;Islas Sebaldinas&quot; or &quot;Sebaldes&quot; for short) remained in use for many years. Today the British name, &quot;Jason Islands&quot;, is fairly universal, named after HMS &quot;Jason&quot;.

Between 1864 and 1866, approximately two million rockhopper and gentoo penguins were killed on the Jasons and boiled to extract their oil.

In March 1970, the islands were bought by Len Hill. The Jason Islands were offered to Hill for £10,000, which included sheep that had been stocked by the previous owner. After some negotiation, he bought the islands for £5,500 without the sheep. Hill once issued some now sought-after Jason Islands banknotes in the name of the islands to raise money for conservation there. The notes were valid until the 31 December 1979 and were signed by &quot;Len Hill – Administrator&quot;.

In the 1990s, two of the Jason Islands, Steeple Jason Island and Grand Jason Island, were bought by New York philanthropist Michael Steinhardt, who later donated them to the Bronx Zoo based Wildlife Conservation Society along with US$425,000 to build a conservation station named after himself and his wife Judy.

==Population==
In modern times none of the Jason Islands has been permanently inhabited, but temporary or seasonal inhabitants have lived on them.

In the 1920s a police house was provided, and a resident constable of the Falkland Islands Police maintained a security presence on the islands, chiefly to prevent foreign seal poaching.

Through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, until the 1980s, several of the islands were also used for grazing sheep, and some cattle. Some buildings remain on the islands from that era, including cottages and sheep shearing sheds.

Some scientific research personnel live temporarily on the islands. In particular, Steinhart Station, constructed in 2003, is an important field research station on Steeple Jason for monitoring wildlife.

==Wildlife==
The Jason Islands are home to the striated caracara, albatrosses, Antarctic skuas and fur seals.

===Important Bird Area===
The Jason Islands group has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). Birds for which the site is of conservation significance include Falkland steamer ducks, ruddy-headed geese (10 breeding pairs), gentoo penguins (12,000 pairs) southern rockhopper penguins (140,000 pairs), macaroni penguins (10 pairs), Magellanic penguins, black-browed albatrosses (210,000 pairs), southern giant petrels (1500 pairs), striated caracaras (250 pairs), blackish cinclodes, Cobb&#x27;s wrens and white-bridled finches.

==Conservation issues==
&quot;Steeple and Grand Jason were stocked with cattle and up to 5,000 sheep from the late 19th century to about 1968.&quot; Overgrazing has left parts of these two islands badly eroded. Elephant Jason was stocked from 1967 to 1971. Since then, the sheep have been removed and the islands have been managed as nature reserves. Fire has been a problem on South Jason. Apart from an infestation of mice on Steeple Jason, the islands in the group are free of introduced predators.

They are now run as a nature reserve.
