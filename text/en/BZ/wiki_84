<doc id="750943" wikidata="Q3253982" url="?curid=750943" title="List of neighborhoods in Seattle">
<text>The city of Seattle, Washington, contains many districts and neighborhoods. The city&#x27;s former mayor Greg Nickels has described it as &quot;a city of neighborhoods&quot;. Early European settlers established widely scattered settlements on the surrounding hills, which grew into neighborhoods and autonomous towns. Conurbations tended to grow from such towns or from unincorporated areas around trolley stops during the 19th and early 20th centuries; the city has consequently suffered from transportation and street-naming problems.

== Definition of Seattle neighborhoods ==

Seattle was established during an economic boom fueled by the timber industry; its early years were characterized by hasty expansion and development, under which residential areas were loosely defined by widely scattered plats. This arrangement was further solidified by the establishment of locally initiated community clubs, public libraries, public schools, and public parks, which created a sense of community and civic participation. At the beginning of the 20th century, Seattle&#x27;s community clubs became influential in the organization of public improvements. These had a significant effect upon the character of their neighborhoods and allowed them to remain distinct from the surrounding areas. Some community clubs used covenants to restrict the ethnicity of residents.

Establishing public library branches can define districts as well as neighborhoods. Public libraries are among the most heavily used buildings. Seattle elected its city council at large from 1910 to 2014, and community clubs lobby councilors for the interests of local residents – such as for a library branch. The community organizations build a voting constituency, and in so doing define a neighborhood. In the absence of ward politics, this and campaign finance legislation are seen as more open alternatives. The Greenwood-Phinney Commercial Club was particularly active in organizing toward the Greenwood branch that opened in 1928.
The Lake City Branch Library opened in 1935 as a few shelves of books in part of a room in Lake City School, shared with the Works Progress Administration (WPA), sponsored by the Pacific Improvement Club community group. The library moved into a new building in 1955.

Elementary public schools effectively defined many neighborhoods, which are often synonymous with the name of the elementary school when the neighborhood and school were established. Many of the neighborhoods contain a few smaller neighborhoods. Mann and Minor neighborhoods in the Central District, were built around their schools. The University Heights school (1903) in the north of the University District was named for the neighborhood, as was the Latona School (1906) in Wallingford.

Parks similarly define some neighborhoods. Madrona Beach and Cowen and Ravenna Parks were privately established to encourage residential development upon otherwise unusable land. The plan for Olmsted Parks fulfilled its goal and significantly influenced the character of neighborhoods around parks and playgrounds. East Phinney and West Meridian neighborhoods are sometimes called Woodland Park, as well as South Green Lake or North Wallingford for Meridian.

== Covenants and racial restrictions ==
Housing covenants became common in the 1920s and were validated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1926. Minorities were effectively limited to the International District and parts of some neighborhoods in south-east Seattle for Asian- and Native Americans; or the Central District for people of African ancestry, clearly defining those neighborhoods. Ballard – Sunset Hill, Beacon Hill, Broadmoor, Green Lake, Laurelhurst, Magnolia, Queen Anne, South Lake City, and other Seattle neighborhoods and blocks had racially or ethnically restrictive housing covenants, such as the following sample:

No person or persons of [any of several minorities] blood, lineage, or extraction shall be permitted to occupy a portion of said property ... except a domestic servant or servants who may actually and in good faith be employed by white occupants.

Further restrictions on conveyance (rental, lease, sale, transfer) were often included, effectively defining most of the neighborhoods in Seattle during the first decades after establishment.

The Supreme Court ruled in 1948 that racial restrictions would no longer be enforced. The Seattle Open Housing Ordinance became effective in 1968. Although unenforceable, legal complications prevent the covenants from being expunged from property title documents.

== Wards and Little City Halls ==
Seattle initially adopted a ward system; however, in 1910, this system was replaced by non-partisan, at-large representation. Variations on ward systems were proposed and rejected in 1914, 1926, 1974, 1995, and 2003 and convictions for campaign-related money laundering followed the 1995 campaign. Critics claimed that district-style elections of the city council would result in Tammany Hall-style politics. In 1973, inspired by Boston&#x27;s model, Mayor Wes Uhlman&#x27;s administration implemented a system of &quot;Little City Halls&quot;, where Community Service Centers (CSCs) assumed responsibility for coordinating municipal services. Uhlman&#x27;s political opponents called the CSCs a thinly disguised ward system designed to promote Uhlman&#x27;s reelection. CSCs became a setting for political arguments between the city council and the mayor; controversies over accountability, cronyism, and ward politics occurred in 1974, 1976, and 1988. In 1991 the CSCs were renamed Neighborhood Service Centers (NSCs) and were placed under the jurisdiction of the Department of Neighborhoods. More recently, their number has been reduced. As of 2011, there are NSCs located in Ballard, Lake City, the University District, the Central District, West Seattle, Southeast Seattle, and Delridge.

== Local improvement districts ==
A local improvement district (LID) is a method by which a group of property owners can share the cost of transportation infrastructure improvements. This involves improving the street, building sidewalks and installing stormwater management systems. Without Seattle&#x27;s LID assessment system, the city would be unable to maintain its rapid growth in population and territory. LIDs have helped define neighborhoods by localizing decisions about issues like sidewalks, vegetation and other features of the public space, permitting neighborhoods to remain distinct from their neighbors. 

== Informal districts ==

No official neighborhood boundaries have existed in Seattle since 1910. Districts and neighborhoods are thus informal; their boundaries may overlap and multiple names may exist for a single district. Boundaries and names can be disputed or change over time. In 2002 a Department of Neighborhoods spokeswoman said, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen my area go from the &#x27;CD&#x27; to &#x27;Madrona&#x27; to &#x27;Greater Madison Valley&#x27; and now &#x27;Madrona Park.&#x27; &quot; Some neighborhoods, such as northwest Seattle, do not have widely recognized names for their greater districts.

Throughout Seattle one can find signs indicating the boundaries of neighborhoods; the locations of these signs have been specified by the city&#x27;s many community councils. However, the boundaries suggested by these signs routinely overlap and differ from delineations on maps. For example, signs indicate that Lake City Way NE is the southeastern boundary of the Maple Leaf neighborhood, while the city clerk&#x27;s archival map places that district&#x27;s southern boundary at 85th Street.

Another example of boundary ambiguity is &quot;Frelard,&quot; which local residents call the area shared by Fremont and Ballard between 3rd and 8th Avenues NW. Signs facing opposite directions on NW Leary Way reveal the overlap.

Further difficulty in defining neighborhoods can result from residents&#x27; identification with neighborhoods different from those marked on signs and maps. After an acrimonious development dispute in 1966, a group of concerned Wallingford citizens enlisted the University of Washington Community Development Bureau to survey their neighborhood; the survey revealed that more residents of southwest Wallingford considered themselves citizens of Fremont than of Wallingford.

=== Transportation ===
Minor arterial roads are generally located along the boundaries of neighborhoods, with streets and highways built according to the street classification system. These effectively help define neighborhoods.

Development in accordance with the street classification system maintains the quality of life of city neighborhoods and improves efficiency of the road system. The classification system discourages rat running through local neighborhood streets.

Transportation hubs, such as business zones and transit stations, such as Park and Ride facilities, provide focal points for districts of neighborhoods the same way trolley stops defined neighborhoods before cars.

== Designated Historic Districts ==
The Department of Neighborhoods designates a number of Historic Districts, which have a similar status to Seattle Landmarks. these are:

* Ballard Avenue Landmark District
* Columbia City Landmark District
* Fort Lawton Landmark District
* Harvard-Belmont Landmark District
* International Special Review District
* Pike Place Market Historical District
* Pioneer Square Preservation District
* Sand Point Naval Air Station Landmark District

== List of districts and neighborhoods ==
Despite complications in Seattle&#x27;s system of neighborhoods and districts, the names and boundaries in the following list are generally accepted and widely used. They are based on the &quot;Seattle City Clerk&#x27;s Neighborhood Map Atlas&quot;, which in turn is based on a variety of sources, including a 1980 neighborhood map produced by the now-defunct Department of Community Development, Seattle Public Library indexes, a 1984-1986 &quot;Neighborhood Profiles&quot; feature series in the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, numerous park, land use and transportation planning studies, as well as records in the Seattle Municipal Archives.

The following table is largely based on maps from the Seattle City Clerk&#x27;s Neighborhood Atlas, but also includes designations from other sources.

== Annexations ==
Seattle annexed eight municipalities between 1905 and 1910, nearly doubling the area size of the city. Annexations by law were begun by the annexee and had to be approved by the Seattle City Council. The appeal of the inexpensive and accessible electric power and water system services of the public utilities were the primary motivations for the annexation movements.

Ballard was its own incorporated town for 17 years, annexed as its own ward. West Seattle incorporated in 1902, then annexed Spring Hill, Riverside, Alki Point, and Youngstown districts. It was the largest of the incorporated towns to be annexed. Southeast Seattle merged the towns of Hillman City and York with other Rainier Valley neighborhoods, then incorporated for the only reason of being annexed. Similarly, the town of South Seattle consisted of mostly industrial Duwamish Valley neighborhoods (except Georgetown); one enclave adjacent to Georgetown omitted at this time was annexed 1921; some land near the river in this area remains part of unincorporated King County. In 1910 Georgetown was the last of this sequence of small incorporated cities and towns to be annexed to Seattle before the 1954 annexation of Lake City.

The following previously incorporated cities and towns were annexed by Seattle. This list is in order of annexation. Other areas annexed to Seattle, were unincorporated before annexation. Examples of the latter include the northern part of Queen Anne Hill, the University District, and the northern area of the city that were once part of then-unincorporated Shoreline.

* Town of South Seattle, incorporated 1905, annexed 20 October 1905.
* City of Columbia (Columbia City), incorporated 1892, annexed 3 May 1907
* Town of Ravenna, incorporated 1906, annexed 15 January 1907
*Southeast Seattle—Hillman City, York, and other Rainier Valley neighborhoods except Columbia City—incorporated July 1906, annexed 7 January 1907
* Town of South Park, incorporated 1902, annexed 3 May 1907.
* City of Ballard, incorporated January 1890, annexed 29 May 1907
* City of West Seattle, incorporated April 1902, annexed 24 July 1907
* City of Georgetown, incorporated 1904, annexed 4 April 1910
* Lake City, incorporated township 1949, annexed January 1954

=== Future ===

Because of the cost of providing city services, low-density residential neighborhoods represent a net revenue loss for municipalities. Because vehicle-license revenue is no longer used to subsidize unincorporated areas, these neighborhoods have become increasingly orphaned.

In April 2004, the City Council voted to defer a decision on Mayor Nickels&#x27; proposal to designate the West Hill and North Highline neighborhoods, part of unincorporated King County, as potential annexation areas (PAAs) for at least a year. Because of the tax revolt that took place in Washington in the late 1990s and early 21st century, the county&#x27;s budget has been reduced and the county has said it is unlikely to be able to maintain adequate levels of funding for urban services in unincorporated areas. The nearby city of Burien, however, issued a 2004 draft report for its own annexation of all or part of North Highline.

North Highline, which adjoins SeaTac, Burien, and Tukwila in addition to Seattle, consists of the Boulevard Park neighborhood and part of White Center. West Hill, which abuts Tukwila and Renton as well as Seattle, consists of Bryn Mawr-Skyway, Lakeridge, and Earlington. Its 2010 population is 15,645.

On December 11, 2006, the Seattle City Council agreed to designate North Highline a &quot;potential annexation area&quot;.

<doc id="750947" wikidata="Q1362101" url="?curid=750947" title="Walter Krueger">
<text>Walter Krueger (26 January 1881 – 20 August 1967) was an American soldier and general officer in the first half of the 20th century. He commanded the Sixth United States Army in the South West Pacific Area during World War II. He rose from the rank of private to general in the United States Army.

Born in Flatow, West Prussia, German Empire, Krueger emigrated to the United States as a boy. He enlisted for service in the Spanish–American War and served in Cuba, and then re-enlisted for service in the Philippine–American War. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1901. In 1914 he was posted to the Pennsylvania Army National Guard. His regiment was mobilized on 23 June 1916 and served along the Mexican border. After the United States commenced hostilities with Germany in April 1917, Krueger was assigned to the 84th Infantry Division as its Assistant Chief of Staff G-3 (Operations), and then its chief of staff. In February 1918, he was sent to Langres to attend the American Expeditionary Forces General Staff School, and in October 1918, he became chief of staff of the Tank Corps.

Between the wars, Krueger served in a number of command and staff positions, and attended the Naval War College at his own request. In 1941, he assumed command of the Third Army, which he led in the Louisiana Maneuvers. He expected, because of his age, to spend the war at home training troops, but in 1943 he was sent to General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s Southwest Pacific Area as commander of the Sixth Army and Alamo Force, which he led in a series of successful campaigns against the Japanese.

As an army commander, Krueger grappled with the problems imposed by vast distances, inhospitable terrain, unfavorable climate, and an indefatigable and dangerous enemy. He balanced the fast pace of MacArthur&#x27;s strategy with the more cautious approach of managing subordinates who often found themselves confronted by unexpectedly large numbers of Japanese troops. In 1945 at the Battle of Luzon, Krueger faced the Japanese army under Tomoyuki Yamashita and Krueger outmaneuvered his enemies like he had in the 1941 exercises. This was Krueger&#x27;s largest, longest, and final battle.

Krueger retired to San Antonio, Texas, where he bought a house and wrote &quot;From Down Under to Nippon&quot;, an account of his campaigns in the Southwest Pacific. His retirement was marred by family tragedies. His son James was dismissed from the army in 1947 for conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman. His wife&#x27;s health deteriorated, and she died of cancer in 1956. His daughter Dorothy stabbed her husband to death in 1952. She was sentenced to life imprisonment by a court-martial, but was freed by the Supreme Court in 1957.

==Education and early life==
Walter Krueger was born on 26 January 1881 in Flatow, West Prussia, then part of the German Empire, now part of Poland. He was the son of Julius Krüger, a Prussian landowner who had served as an officer in the Franco-Prussian War, and his wife, Anna, formerly Hasse. Following Julius&#x27;s death, Anna and her three children emigrated to the United States to be near her uncle in St. Louis, Missouri. Walter was then eight years old. In St. Louis, Anna married Emil Carl Schmidt, a Lutheran minister.

The family subsequently settled in Madison, Indiana. Krueger was tutored by his stepfather, educated in the public schools of Madison, and completed high school at Madison&#x27;s Upper Seminary. As a teenager, he wanted to become a naval officer, but when his mother objected he decided to become a blacksmith instead. After graduating from high school, Krueger enrolled at the Cincinnati Technical High School, where he learned blacksmithing and completed science and mathematics courses in preparation for college studies in engineering.

==Early military service==
On 17 June 1898, Krueger enlisted for service in the Spanish–American War with the 2nd United States Volunteer Infantry. He reached Santiago de Cuba a few weeks after the Battle of San Juan Hill, and spent eight months there on occupation duties, rising to the rank of sergeant. Mustered out of the volunteers in February 1899, he returned home to Ohio, planning to become a civil engineer.

However, many of his comrades were re-enlisting for service in the Philippine–American War and in June 1899 Krueger re-enlisted as a private in M Company of the 12th Infantry. Soon he was on his way to fight Emilio Aguinaldo&#x27;s &quot;Insurrectos&quot; as part of Major General Arthur MacArthur, Jr.&#x27;s 2nd Division of the Eighth Army Corps. He took part in the advance from Angeles to Tarlac, Aguinaldo&#x27;s capital. But Aguinaldo had fled, and the 12th Infantry pursued him vainly all the way through Luzon&#x27;s central plain to Dagupan. While serving in an infantry unit in the Philippines, he was promoted to sergeant. On 1 July 1901, he was commissioned a second lieutenant and posted to the 30th Infantry on Marinduque.

Krueger returned to the United States with the 30th Infantry in December 1903. The regiment moved to Fort Crook, Nebraska. In September 1904, he married Grace Aileen Norvell, whom he had met in the Philippines. They had three children: James Norvell, born on 29 July 1905; Walter Jr., born on 25 April 1910; and Dorothy Jane, who was born on 24 January 1913. Both James and Walter Jr. attended the United States Military Academy, James graduating with the class of 1926, and Walter Jr. with the class of 1931. Dorothy married an army officer, Aubrey D. Smith, of the class of 1930.

In 1904, Krueger attended the Infantry-Cavalry School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and upon completing the course was chosen as a Distinguished Graduate. This was followed by the Command and General Staff College in 1907. He then joined the 23rd Infantry at Fort Ontario, New York. After a second tour in the Philippines, he returned to the United States in June 1909, and was assigned to Department of Languages at Fort Leavenworth as an instructor in Spanish, French and German, which he could speak fluently. He also taught National Guard officers at Camp Benjamin Harrison, Indiana, and Pine Camp, New York. He published translations of several German military texts, most notably William Balck&#x27;s &quot;Tactics&quot;. The book attracted the attention of the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, Major General Leonard Wood, and was widely read.

With the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Krueger was offered a post as an observer with the German Army but was forced to turn it down due to familial commitments. Instead, he was posted to the 10th Infantry of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard. The regiment was mobilized on 23 June 1916 and served along the Mexican border for five months as part of the Mexican Punitive Expedition under Major General John J. Pershing, although no National Guard units fought Mexican troops. The unit was mustered out in October 1916.

Afterwards, Krueger remained with the National Guard. He trained units, and helped establish a school for officers at the University of Pennsylvania. In an article in the &quot;Infantry Journal&quot;, he called for a large, national, conscript army similar to those of European countries, arguing that this would be in accord with America&#x27;s democratic values.

==World War I and immediate aftermath==
After the United States commenced hostilities against Germany in April 1917, Krueger was assigned to the newly activated 84th Division, a National Army formation created largely from draftees, at Camp Zachary Taylor as its assistant chief of staff G-3 (operations). He became the 84th&#x27;s chief of staff, and along with it came the temporary rank of major, as of 5 August 1917.

In February 1918, he was sent to Langres, France, to attend the General Staff School of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF). The school had been created by the AEF&#x27;s commander-in-chief, General John J. Pershing, and his staff, &quot;to instruct and bring up to date many officers who never had any formal or specific staff training&quot;. All officers from divisions that were not under orders for France were ordered to return home in May 1918, but Krueger stayed on as G-3 of the 26th &quot;Yankee&quot; Division, an Army National Guard formation.

The French government requested that Krueger be sent home due to his German origin, and Krueger was re-posted to the 84th Division, but he soon returned to France and the AEF, as the 84th Division embarked for France in August 1918. He was not destined to remain with the division for very long, however, as in October he became chief of staff of the Tank Corps of the AEF, a job which he found both rewarding and frustrating, as &quot;he was tied to his desk most of the day, which he did not particularly enjoy&quot;, although he hoped that such a position might result in quick promotion.

After the armistice with Germany on 11 November, which ended the fighting, he became assistant chief of staff of VI Corps and, after that was disbanded in April 1919, served in the same role with IV Corps on occupation duty in Germany, advancing to the rank of temporary colonel. His stay was short, however, as IV Corps was also broken up in May, although his somewhat brief service had given Krueger experience in dealing with larger units and formations.

For his services in the war, he was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal in 1919. The citation for his DSM reads:

==Interwar years==
With the end of the war, Krueger returned to the United States on 22 June 1919 and was initially posted to the Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia. In 1920, he assumed command of the 55th Infantry Regiment at Camp Funston, Kansas. He reverted to his permanent rank of captain on 30 June 1920 but was promoted to the permanent rank of major the next day. He attended the Army War College, graduating in 1921, and remaining for a year as an instructor, where he taught such classes as the &quot;Art of Command&quot;.

He paid a four-month visit to Germany in 1922 as part of the War College&#x27;s Historical Section, during which he examined documents related to World War I in the German War Archives. These informed his lectures on the war, and he argued that much of the German Army&#x27;s effectiveness was attributable to its system of decentralized command. Krueger urged that American commanders in the field should be given wider latitude in carrying out their orders.
From 1922 to 1925, Krueger served in the War Plans Division of the War Department General Staff in Washington, DC. Krueger worked on the United States color-coded war plans, particularly War Plan Green, for another war with Mexico, and War Plan Blue, for another civil war in the United States. He traveled to the Panama Canal Zone in January 1923 to report on the state of the defenses there. After he returned, he was assigned to the Joint Army and Navy Planning Committee, an organ of the Joint Army and Navy Board responsible for coordinating war plans between the two services.

While with the Joint Planning Committee, he worked on War Plan Orange, the plan for a war with Japan, and War Plan Tan, for a war with Cuba. Krueger considered the problems of inter-service cooperation. At his own request, he attended the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island, in 1925 and 1926. He continued to ruminate on the nature of command. &quot;Doctrine&quot;, he wrote, &quot;knits all the parts of the military force together in intellectual bonds.&quot;

Krueger came to feel the prospects for promotion in the infantry were very poor, and in 1927 he tried to transfer to the United States Army Air Corps. He attended the Air Corps Primary Flying School at Brooks Field, Texas, but suffered an attack of neuritis in his right arm, and his flight instructor, Lieutenant Claire Lee Chennault, failed him. In December 1927, he was offered a position as an instructor at the Naval War College, where he taught classes on World War I, and on joint operations.

In June 1932, Krueger became commander of the 6th Infantry Regiment at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, where he was promoted to colonel again on 1 August 1932. Now aged 51, he became resigned to retiring as a colonel, but in 1934 he returned to the War Plans Division, becoming chief of the division in May 1936, and was promoted to temporary brigadier general in October 1936. In September 1938, Krueger went to Fort George G. Meade, Maryland, as commander of the 16th Infantry Brigade.

He was promoted to temporary major general in February 1939, when he became commander of the 2nd Infantry Division at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. The 2nd Infantry Division was at the time being used as the Proposed Infantry Division (PID). With Lesley J. McNair as commander of the 2nd Division Artillery and chief of staff of the PID, the PID tested of the US Army&#x27;s new triangular division concept. As a result of the lessons learned from the PID&#x27;s training and exercises, Krueger was able to offer recommendations for improvements to the triangular division concept, including taking advantage of mechanization and fast-paced tactics. The troops who took part in the PID experiment called themselves the &quot;Blitzkruegers&quot;; the triangular division model was adopted, and became the Army&#x27;s standard design for infantry divisions in World War II.

==World War II==
===Training in the United States===

Krueger became commander of IX Corps on 31 January 1940. This corps was created to control units of the Third Army engaged in large scale maneuvers in 1940, in which Krueger&#x27;s IX Corps conducted a series of mock battles against Walter Short&#x27;s IV Corps. On 27 June, Krueger became commander of the VIII Corps. On 16 May 1941, he was promoted to lieutenant general, in command of the Third Army. He also became commander of the Southern Defense Command on 16 July 1941. Krueger asked for—and got—Colonel Dwight D. Eisenhower assigned to him as his chief of staff.

The Louisiana Maneuvers pitted Krueger&#x27;s Third Army against Lieutenant General Ben Lear&#x27;s Second Army. The maneuvers were a test ground for doctrine and equipment, and gave senior commanders experience in maneuvering their formations. In the first phase, Krueger quickly proved himself to be the more modern general. He responded adroitly to a changed battle situation by re-orienting his front from northeast to northwest, and was able to inflict a series of reverses on Lear&#x27;s forces.

In the second phase, Krueger had a superior force, and had to advance on Shreveport, Louisiana. Lear&#x27;s forces conducted a stubborn withdrawal, demolishing bridges in order to slow Krueger down. Krueger responded by sending Major General George S. Patton, Jr.&#x27;s 2nd Armored Division on a wide flanking maneuver through Texas. Afterwards, Eisenhower became the head of the War Plans Division, and was replaced as Krueger&#x27;s chief of staff by Colonel Alfred M. Gruenther. After he too was transferred, Krueger replaced him with Colonel George B. Honnen.

Krueger wrote to a friend that: 

===Sixth Army===
It therefore came as a surprise when Krueger was informed that a theater commander had requested his services. General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA), said that he was &quot;especially anxious to have Krueger due to my long and intimate association with him&quot;. This too came as a surprise to Krueger; while the two men had known each other for forty years, and Krueger had been chief of the War Plans Division when MacArthur was chief of staff, the two had never been close.
The War Department approved Krueger&#x27;s transfer to SWPA, but did not approve MacArthur&#x27;s request for Third Army headquarters. There were only three American divisions in SWPA: the 32nd Infantry Division at Rockhampton, Queensland, the 41st Infantry Division in the Buna area in Papua, and the 1st Marine Division in Melbourne, Victoria. The 1st Cavalry Division and the 24th Infantry Division were scheduled to arrive in 1943, and other divisions would follow in 1944, but for the time being there were many fewer troops than an army would normally control. The War Department therefore saw no need for a full strength army headquarters. Instead, Krueger had to make do with a skeleton staff of a new Sixth Army, which was activated in January 1943, with less than half the establishment strength of an army headquarters.

Krueger took with him several key members of the Third Army staff, including Brigadier General George Honnen as chief of staff, Colonel George H. Decker as deputy chief of staff, Colonel George S. Price as assistant chief of staff, G-1 (Personnel), Colonel Horton V. White as assistant chief of staff, G-2 (intelligence), Clyde Eddleman as assistant chief of staff, G-3 (operations) and Colonel Kenneth Pierce as assistant chief of staff, G-4 (supply).

Honnen had health problems, and spent much of April, May and June 1943 in hospital before being ordered home on 18 June. He was replaced by Brigadier General Edwin D. Patrick, who had served on the staff of Admiral William F. Halsey in the South Pacific Area. Patrick did not get along smoothly with Krueger or the rest of the Sixth Army staff, and in May 1944 Patrick was appointed to command the 158th Regimental Combat Team, and Decker became chief of staff.

Command in the Southwest Pacific Area was complicated. Instead of operations being conducted by the Sixth Army, its headquarters was used for what became Alamo Force. As a task force, Alamo Force came directly under MacArthur, rather than under the Allied Land Forces. Krueger noted that &quot;the inherent difficulties faced by my dual headquarters in planning and administration were aggravated by the command setup, which was a novel one to say the least.&quot; Because Alamo Force was a purely operational entity, administration was handled by the United States Army Forces in the Far East. Although there was only one army staff, Alamo Force was in New Guinea while the main body of Sixth Army headquarters was in Brisbane until February 1944, when the two were finally brought together. They still had a dual role as Alamo Force and Sixth Army until September, when Alamo Force was discontinued and the Sixth Army became directly responsible for operations.

===Bismarck Archipelago===
The geographical, engineering and logistical difficulties of conducting operations in SWPA were driven home by Alamo Force&#x27;s first operation, Operation Chronicle, the occupation of Woodlark and Kiriwina Islands in June 1943. Despite the fact that the operation was unopposed by the Japanese, it was subject to delays. Krueger visited Kiriwina, where road work and airbase development were held up by heavy rains, on 11 July. He was dissatisfied with the rate of progress and relieved the task force commander. The arrival of additional engineers sped up the base development effort, and No. 79 Squadron RAAF commenced operations from Kiriwina on 18 August.
He was also concerned by reports of the invasion of Kiska in the Aleutian Islands in August 1943, in which a large Allied force invaded an island that had already been evacuated by the Japanese. If this could happen, it was also possible that a force might attack where the Japanese were unexpectedly strong. Different levels of command sometimes came up with widely varying estimates of Japanese strength because they used different methods to estimate it.

An attempt to obtain information for Operation Dexterity, the attack on New Britain, with a joint Army-Navy reconnaissance team raised issues of inter-service cooperation. The Navy was mainly interested in gathering hydrographic data rather than information on the state of the Japanese defenders. Because of a breakdown in communications, the PT boat that was supposed to collect the team was unable to rendezvous with it, and the team had to spend eleven more days on the island. Finally, the Navy tried to prevent the Army commander from briefing Alamo Force headquarters on what had occurred.

Krueger decided that he needed to have his own strategic reconnaissance capability. In November 1943, he formed the Alamo Scouts as a special unit for reconnaissance and raiding. An Alamo Scouts Training Center for volunteers was established on Fergusson Island, not far from Alamo Force&#x27;s headquarters on Goodenough Island, under the command of Colonel Frederick W. Bradshaw, whom Krueger had first encountered during the Louisiana maneuvers. The top graduates of the six-week training course were assigned to the Alamo Scouts; the other graduates were returned to their units where they could be used for similar work. By the end of the war, Alamo Scouts teams had conducted 106 missions.

In what became a standard procedure in SWPA, MacArthur&#x27;s General Headquarters (GHQ) nominated the objectives, set the target date, and allocated the troops to the operation, leaving Alamo Force to work out the details. MacArthur was not inflexible, however, and allowed Krueger to alter the staging areas, and postpone the operation by a month. Krueger&#x27;s concerns about the possibility of high casualties in securing the Gasmata area, and doubts as to whether the area was suitable for airbase development, led to it being dropped as a target. Arawe was substituted, and the size of the whole operation was scaled back. Krueger hoped to observe the 1st Marine Division&#x27;s landing at Cape Gloucester in December 1943, but was unable to do so until the planning for the January 1944 landing at Saidor was complete. He crossed the Dampier Strait in a PT boat in stormy weather. PBY Catalinas sent to bring him back were unable to land, and he had to return on the destroyer .

Krueger accepted reports of a Japanese counterattack at Saidor, and sent reinforcements in response, but the attack did not eventuate. Because the 32nd Infantry Division was required for the upcoming Hansa Bay operation, he was initially reluctant to authorize it to block the trails behind the American beachhead. When he finally did so, it was too late. The retreating Japanese made good their escape, thereby defeating the whole purpose of the operation. The next operation, the Admiralty Islands campaign in February 1944, played out differently. Based on Fifth Air Force reports that the islands were unoccupied, MacArthur accelerated his timetable and ordered an immediate reconnaissance in force of the islands. Krueger sent in the Alamo Scouts, who confirmed that the islands were still well-defended.

Krueger did what he could to accelerate the movement of units of Major General Innis P. Swift&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Division to the Admiralty Islands in response to urgent pleas from Brigadier General William C. Chase, who managed to defeat the numerically superior Japanese forces. Krueger was unimpressed with Chase. &quot;His task&quot;, Krueger wrote to Swift, &quot;was undoubtedly a difficult one, but did not, in my judgment, warrant the nervousness apparent in some of his despatches. This, and his failure to obey repeated positive orders to furnish detailed information of his situation and his losses, his closing his radio station during long periods, and his evident ignorance that reinforcements could not reach him by the times he demanded, were not calculated to inspire confidence.&quot;

===New Guinea Campaign===

Over the next few months, the tempo of operations increased, forcing the Sixth Army to plan and execute multiple operations simultaneously. Operations Reckless and Persecution in April 1944 together comprised the largest operation yet in SWPA, with the 24th and 41st Infantry Divisions of Lieutenant General Robert L. Eichelberger&#x27;s I Corps landing at Tanahmerah and Humboldt bays near Hollandia, while the 163rd Regimental Combat Team landed at Aitape. Eichelberger was Krueger&#x27;s most senior subordinate, but when he did not meet Krueger&#x27;s expectation, Krueger let him know in no uncertain terms. &quot;In my more than 40 years as an officer&quot;, Krueger told one of his staff, &quot;I have never raised my voice to an enlisted man, but a corps commander should know better.&quot;

Krueger visited the beachhead with MacArthur and Eichelberger on the first day. After inspecting the beachhead, they went to the for ice cream sodas, whereupon MacArthur suggested, in view of the victory at Hollandia, they could accelerate the campaign timetable by moving on to Wakde-Sarmi immediately. Krueger was willing to consider the idea, although he had already ordered the troops designated for Wakde-Sarmi, the 32nd Infantry Division, to reinforce the position at Aitape, where he expected a major Japanese counterattack. Eichelberger was vehemently opposed, and the matter was dropped.

Krueger moved his headquarters to Hollandia in May 1944. The swampy area with its restricted anchorages proved unsuitable for a major airbase complex, although fighter strips were constructed, and it was developed as a staging area. MacArthur was compelled to press on with the Wakde-Sarmi project lest his troops become stranded without adequate air cover. A shortage of shipping meant that the operation had to be carried out by the troops in the Hollandia area, so Krueger nominated the 163rd Regimental Combat Team for Wakde, while the rest of the 41st Infantry Division captured Sarmi. However, with only days to go, doubts surfaced about the viability of construction in the Sarmi area, and Biak was substituted. In view of the difficulties involved in changing plans, and moving the troops around, MacArthur agreed to postpone both operations, Wakde until 17 May and Biak to 27 May.

As a result, Alamo Force became involved in desperate fighting on three different fronts simultaneously. The landing at Wakde was opposed by nearly twice as many Japanese troops than had been expected. When Krueger discovered that the Japanese were massing for an assault on the American position, he ordered a pre-emptive attack. &quot;Krueger&quot;, wrote Edward Drea, &quot;was too good a soldier to stand pat and wait for a Japanese attack.&quot; Official historian Robert Ross Smith noted that &quot;This decision, based upon the scanty, incomplete information concerning Japanese strength and dispositions available to General Krueger at the time, was destined to precipitate a protracted and bitter fight.&quot; However, even if Krueger had known the true size of the Japanese force, he might still, under the circumstances, have taken the same approach.

The estimates of the number of Japanese troops on Biak were out by a similar margin, resulting in heavy casualties. In the Battle of Biak, stubborn Japanese resistance halted the 41st Infantry Division, and forced its commander, Major General Horace H. Fuller, to appeal to Krueger for reinforcements. In response, Krueger sent the 163rd Regimental Combat Team from Wakde. MacArthur soon grew impatient, as he needed the airstrips on Biak to support Admiral Chester Nimitz&#x27;s Invasion of Saipan. Nimitz&#x27;s operation ultimately drew Japanese attention away from Biak.

MacArthur put pressure on Krueger for results, and Krueger in turn put pressure on Fuller. Krueger decided that Fuller had too many responsibilities as both task force commander and division commander, and decided to supersede him by sending Eichelberger to take over the task force. Fuller then submitted his resignation. Eichelberger&#x27;s chief of staff, Brigadier General Clovis Byers, offered to have Decker intercept and destroy the resignation before Krueger saw it, but Fuller decided against this. The battle raged for nearly a month. Afterwards, Krueger demanded an explanation from Eichelberger as to why he had allowed Fuller to quit.

Meanwhile, Japanese forces under Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi attacked Alamo Force&#x27;s position at Aitape in the Battle of Driniumor River. Krueger called for an energetic defense, but the cautious commander of XI Corps, Major General Charles P. Hall, retained nine battalions around the airbase at Tadji. This left Brigadier General Clarence A. Martin without the resources to implement Krueger&#x27;s strategy, and he conducted a fighting withdrawal instead. Krueger travelled to Aitape where Hall presented him a counterattack plan, which he approved. By August, the fighting had ended and Adachi had been defeated.

===Philippines campaign===

MacArthur accelerated his timetable yet again in September 1944, and brought forward the planned invasion of Leyte to October 1944. That this was the worst time of the year for campaigning on Leyte was not overlooked. Typhoons and heavy rains hampered the efforts to construct and rehabilitate airbases, and without them, large numbers of aircraft could not operate from Leyte. This meant not only that few air strikes could be flown in support of the Sixth Army, but that the Allied Air Forces could not prevent the Japanese from reinforcing Leyte.

An additional five Japanese divisions and two mixed brigades were sent to Leyte, and the battle became one of grinding attrition. Able to view his troops in action more often than hitherto, Krueger found much to criticize. He noted that tanks were employed poorly, that the infantry were not aggressive enough, and saw poor sanitation and meals as a sign that officers were not taking adequate care of their men. Krueger&#x27;s generalship has also been questioned, with Ronald Spector criticizing &quot;Krueger&#x27;s disastrous decision to delay the push into the mountains west of Carigara in favor of beach defense.&quot; Krueger based his cautious appreciation of the situation on various intelligence sources rather than relying solely on Ultra.

In January 1945, the Sixth Army embarked on its largest, longest and last campaign, the invasion of Luzon. Krueger intended to make &quot;maximum utilization of America&#x27;s materiel and industrial superiority&quot;. Once again, intelligence estimates of Japanese strength were questionable. MacArthur&#x27;s intelligence officer, Brigadier General Charles A. Willoughby, basing his estimates on Ultra, believed that there were about 172,000 Japanese troops on Luzon. Krueger&#x27;s intelligence officer, Colonel Horton V. White, reckoned that there were 234,000.

MacArthur did not believe there were anywhere near that number. In fact, General Tomoyuki Yamashita had 287,000 troops on Luzon. For the first time since Louisiana in 1941, Krueger was able to maneuver his army as a single body instead of having elements employed on multiple battles on scattered islands. He regarded Yamashita&#x27;s employment of armor as poor. Instead of using the 2nd Armored Division for a decisive counterattack against the vulnerable flank, Yamashita frittered away its strength in piecemeal efforts.

As the campaign unfolded, Krueger was pressured by MacArthur to capture Manila. He sent messages reporting what he saw as a lack of drive among the troops, and even moved his theater headquarters forward of Krueger&#x27;s. MacArthur tried to exploit Krueger&#x27;s rivalry with Eichelberger by allowing the latter&#x27;s Eighth Army to conduct its own drive on Manila from the south. Krueger eventually sent a flying column from the 1st Cavalry Division, but MacArthur&#x27;s expectation that the Japanese would not defend Manila was proven incorrect. Weeks of ferocious fighting were required to capture the city.

Krueger was promoted to general on 5 March 1945. MacArthur recommended Krueger for the rank, even as he clashed with him over the drive on Manila, and rated Krueger&#x27;s generalship higher than that of Patton or Omar Bradley. Krueger&#x27;s campaign on Luzon continued until 30 June 1945, when he handed over responsibility to Eichelberger in order to prepare for Operation Olympic, the invasion of Kyushu.

This proved unnecessary when Japan surrendered, and in September 1945 the Sixth Army took up occupation duty in Japan. Krueger established his headquarters in Kyoto, and assumed responsibility for Kyushu, Shikoku and southern Honshu. The Sixth Army remained in Japan until it handed over its occupation responsibilities to the Eighth Army on 31 December 1945. It was deactivated on 25 January 1946, and Krueger retired in July. For his service as commander of the Sixth Army in World War II, Krueger was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, an oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal, and the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. He was awarded a second oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal for his part in the Occupation of Japan.

==Later life==
Krueger retired to San Antonio, Texas, where, in February 1946, he bought a house for the first time. Because of a large income tax bill left over from the war, he was unable to buy it outright and so some of his friends established the Krueger Fund Committee, which paid for much of the house. In retirement, Krueger was involved in a number of charity and community organizations, including the United Service Organization, the Red Cross, and the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, and he served as director of civil defense for San Antonio and Bexar County.

Colonel Horton White, Krueger&#x27;s former intelligence officer, approached him with an offer from George Edward Brett of Macmillan to publish his memoirs. Krueger did not wish to write an autobiography, which he felt was &quot;invariably apt to be an apologia&quot;, but was willing to write up an account of the Sixth Army&#x27;s exploits. He commenced work in 1947, but the project proceeded slowly. The result was &quot;From Down Under to Nippon: The Story of the 6th Army In World War II&quot;, which was published in 1953. Historians were disappointed with the book, as it recounted what was known from the Sixth Army&#x27;s reports, but provided little insight into the reasons why operations were conducted the way they were.

Krueger kept in contact with his wartime colleagues. He was proud of the subsequent accomplishments of members of his wartime staff, and traveled to New York each year to celebrate MacArthur&#x27;s birthday with MacArthur and other former senior commanders of the Southwest Pacific Area. He lectured at Army Schools and civic organizations, offering opinions on subjects such as the value of training, the benefit of universal military service, and the need for a unified defense establishment.

===Kinsella v. Krueger===

Krueger&#x27;s retirement was marred by family tragedies. His son James was dismissed from the army in 1947 for conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman after a drunken incident. Grace&#x27;s health deteriorated, and she suffered from heart disease and high blood pressure. She was diagnosed with cancer in 1955, and died on 13 May 1956. Most dramatically, on 3 October 1952, a lonely and depressed Dorothy fatally stabbed her husband, Colonel Aubrey D. Smith, with a hunting knife while he slept in their Army quarters in Japan. Dorothy, who felt that her husband now regarded her no more than &quot;a clinging handicap to his professional career&quot;, had turned to alcohol and drugs.

By six votes to three, a U.S. Army court-martial found Dorothy guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced her &quot;to be confined at hard labor for the rest of her natural life&quot;. A unanimous verdict of guilty would have made the death sentence mandatory. She was flown back to the United States in a Military Air Transport Service plane and was imprisoned at the Federal Prison Camp, Alderson, in West Virginia. The United States Court of Military Appeals rejected an appeal filed by Krueger&#x27;s lawyers that argued that Dorothy was not sane at the time of the incident, and that the testimony that the court-martial had heard to the contrary was military rather than medical.

However, in 1955, in a similar case involving another woman, Clarice B. Covert, who had killed her husband in England with an axe, Federal District Court Judge Edward A. Tamm ruled that civilians who accompany military forces overseas could not be imprisoned by military courts. The two cases, &quot;Kinsella v. Krueger&quot; and &quot;Reid v. Covert&quot;, went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which affirmed that military trials of civilians were indeed constitutional, only to reverse itself a year later in a review of the decisions. Dorothy was released, and went to live with Krueger in San Antonio.

When his old friend Fay W. Brabson wrote a letter in 1960 complaining about not being promoted before retirement, Krueger replied that:

==Death and legacy==
Krueger&#x27;s health began to decline in the late 1950s. He developed glaucoma in his right eye, and sciatica in his left hip. In 1960, he had a hernia operation, followed by kidney surgery in 1963. Nonetheless, he continued to attend MacArthur&#x27;s birthday in New York. He died from pneumonia at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, on 20 August 1967, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. His papers are in the Cushing Memorial Library at Texas A&amp;M University.

Although Krueger led a large force in operations over a large area for over two years, appearing on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine on 29 January 1945, and Krueger Middle School was named after him in San Antonio, Texas, in 1962, he never became a well-known figure like MacArthur. Krueger&#x27;s forte was what is today termed the operational level of war, transforming MacArthur&#x27;s strategic vision into reality. Krueger has usually been characterized as &quot;an overly cautious commander who impeded MacArthur&#x27;s fast-paced strategy.&quot; William Manchester speculated that &quot;the General knew his plodding subordinate was a useful counterweight to his own bravura&quot;, and Edward Drea noted that at the Battle of the Drinumor, Krueger&#x27;s actions were &quot;entirely out of keeping with his otherwise methodical and plodding generalship&quot;.

<doc id="750954" wikidata="Q920050" url="?curid=750954" title="Fixedsys">
<text>Fixedsys is a family of raster monospaced fonts. The name means &quot;fixed system&quot;, because its glyphs are monospace or fixed-width (although bolded characters are wider than non-bolded, unlike other monospace fonts such as Courier). It is the oldest font in Microsoft Windows, and was the system font in Windows 1.0 and 2.0, where it was simply named &quot;System&quot;. For Windows 3.x, the system font was changed to a proportional sans-serif font named System, but Fixedsys remained the default font in Notepad.

Fixedsys fonts family contains fonts encoded in several Windows code pages, with multiple resolutions of the font for each code page. Fixedsys fonts of different code pages have different point sizes.

The glyphs for the upper areas of each one appear to be drawn separately, not taken from a single master set, as there are visible differences in the appearance of various visually similar characters that are shared between the code pages.

Though Fixedsys is a sans-serif font, it is vaguely similar in appearance to the hardware text mode font of most IBM-compatible PCs, though not as similar as certain sizes of Terminal fonts seen in Windows.

In Windows 95, 98, and Windows Me, Fixedsys remains as the default font for Notepad. This font was superseded by Lucida Console in Notepad for later versions of Windows. In Windows 95, this default font cannot be changed. Fixedsys of other code pages can be selected by specifying script settings in font selection dialogue, but not font of all code pages can be chosen.

Due to its clean style and easy readability, it has enjoyed some popularity with the programming community, even giving rise to an imitation font — Fixedsys Excelsior — which, based on the original Fixedsys typeface, also includes a large number of Unicode script ranges.

There is a certain amount of similarity between Fixedsys and Chicago, the default system typeface on the Apple Macintosh between 1984 and 1997. The key difference is that Chicago is a proportional typeface while Fixedsys is monospaced. A smaller CGA version of this font also exists, with some characters bearing a resemblance to the IBM 8x8 CGA font. The EGA version is nearly identical to the CGA version, only in differing in a small number of characters.

According to a string embedded in the .FON file (which is viewable with a hex editor or with a typeface editor such as Fony), this font was designed in 1984 by Bitstream Inc., but the high resolution 8514/a version (used in modern versions of Windows operating system as the high DPI variant, which is larger and looks different from the VGA version) was designed in 1987 by Microsoft Corporation.

== Example ==

The following is the lorem ipsum as it appears here written in Fixedsys.

<doc id="750956" wikidata="Q7608567" url="?curid=750956" title="Stephen Alencastre">
<text>Bishop Stephen Peter Alencastre, [[Picpus Fathers|SSCC]] (born Estêvão Pedro de Alencastre; November 3, 1876 – November 9, 1940) was a bishop of the Roman Catholic Church who served as the fifth and last Vicar Apostolic of the Vicariate Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands (now the Diocese of Honolulu). He was also an apparent titular bishop of Arabissus.

==Early life==
Born on the island of Porto Santo in the Madeira Islands of Portugal and brought to Hawai‘i as an infant, Alencastre later returned to Europe to finish his seminary studies in Belgium. He was ordained to the priesthood on April 5, 1902, at the age of 25, as a member of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary and returned to serve the people of Hawai‘i.

==Episcopacy==

When the Vicar Apostolic, Libert H. Boeynaems, SSCC, fell ill, Alencastre was appointed by Pope Pius XI as coadjutor Vicar Apostolic, with the right of succession, on April 29, 1924. On August 24 of that year, he was consecrated Titular Bishop of Arabissus at the age of 47.

Upon the death of Boeynaems on May 13, 1926, Alencastre automatically succeeded him as Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. He was the first bishop in Hawai‘i to have been raised in the Hawaiian Islands.

Alencastre&#x27;s personal mission included continuing to expand the number of schools and parish churches in the Islands (and to renovate the existing ones) and to build a seminary to form vowed religious locally to the priesthood. This came to fruition with the building of St. Stephen&#x27;s Seminary, named in honor of the Bishop&#x27;s own patron saint, which is still operational. The bishop was also partly responsible for the increase in the variety of religious orders in Hawai‘i, inviting such groups as the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet and the Maryknolls to help spread of Catholicism in the Hawaiian Islands.

===Episcopal arms===
A window in the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace in Honolulu depicts his episcopal coat-of-arms, as well as a portrayal of a blessing being bestowed upon him by Pope Pius XI. His episcopal motto was &quot;Opportet illum regnare&quot; (&quot;He [Christ] must reign&quot;), derived from a phrase in 1 Corinthians 15: 24–26.

Bishop Alencastre was the first to include in his episcopal arms the &quot;Pūloʻuloʻu&quot; (&quot;kapu&quot; sticks)—traditional symbols of the Hawaiian people, and the colours of the Hawaiian flag. In keeping with the traditions of ecclesiastical heraldry, he utilized the green &quot;galero&quot;, a hat reserved for bishops and cardinals, at the top of his arms.

==Death and legacy==

Alencastre died in 1940 on a boat &quot;en route&quot; to Hawai‘i from Los Angeles, California—six days after his 64th birthday. He was subsequently interred at the Honolulu Catholic Cemetery in downtown Honolulu.

Following his death, he was posthumously awarded the honor of &quot;Officer of the Order of the Crown&quot; by King Leopold III of Belgium, while a street in Honolulu bears his surname.

After continuing and completing much of the work begun by Alencastre and his Sacred Hearts predecessors, the mission area of the Hawaiian Islands was elevated to the status of the Diocese of Honolulu by Pope Pius XII a few months following his death. The history of the Catholic Sacred Hearts mission in the Hawaiian Islands was documented by one of the congregation&#x27;s priests and later compiled and published in a book called &quot;Pioneers of the Faith&quot;.

<text>The Compacts of Free Association (COFA) are international agreements establishing and governing the relationships of free association between the United States and the three Pacific Island sovereign states of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), and the Republic of Palau. As a result, these countries are sometimes known as the Freely Associated States (FASs). All three agreements next expire in 2043.

These countries, together with the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, formerly constituted the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, a United Nations trusteeship administered by the United States Navy from 1947 to 1951 and by the US Department of the Interior from 1951 to 1986 (to 1994 for Palau).

The compacts came into being as an extension of the US–UN territorial trusteeship agreement, which obliged the federal government of the United States &quot;to promote the development of the people of the Trust Territory toward self-government or independence as appropriate to the particular circumstances of the Trust Territory and its peoples and the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned&quot;. Under the compacts, the US federal government provides guaranteed financial assistance over a 15-year period administered through its Office of Insular Affairs in exchange for full international defense authority and responsibilities.

The Compacts of Free Association were initiated by negotiators in 1980 and signed by the parties in the years 1982 and 1983. They were approved by the citizens of the Pacific states in plebiscites held in 1983. Legislation on the compacts was adopted by the U.S. Congress in 1986 and signed into law on November 13, 1986.

==Associated states==
==Economic provisions==
Each of the associated states actively participates in all Office of Insular Affairs technical assistance activities. The US gives only these countries access to many US domestic programs, including disaster response and recovery and hazard mitigation programs under the Federal Emergency Management Agency, some US Department of Education programs including the Pell Grant, and services provided by the National Weather Service, the United States Postal Service, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and US representation to the International Frequency Registration Board of the International Telecommunication Union. The Compact area, while outside the customs area of the United States, is mainly duty-free for imports.

Most citizens of the associated states may live and work in the United States, and most US citizens and their spouses may live and work in the associated states. In 1996, the US Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act removed Medicaid benefits for resident foreigners from the states, even after the five-year waiting period that most other resident aliens have. However, in December 2020, Congress restored Medicaid for Compact of Free Association communities.

==Military provisions==

The COFA allows the United States to operate armed forces in Compact areas and to demand land for operating bases, subject to negotiation, and excludes the militaries of other countries without US permission. The US in turn becomes responsible for protecting its affiliate countries and responsible for administering all international defense treaties and affairs, though it may not declare war on their behalf. It is not allowed to use nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons in Palauan territory. In the territories of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia it is not allowed to store such weapons except in times of national emergency, state of war, or when necessary to defend against an actual or impending attack on the US, the Marshall Islands, or the Federated States of Micronesia.

Citizens of the associated states may serve in America&#x27;s armed forces, and there is a high level of military enlistment by Compact citizens. For example, in 2008, the Federated States of Micronesia had a higher per-capita enlistment rate than any US state, and had more than five times the national per-capita average of casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan: nine soldiers out of a population of 107,000.

==21st-century renewal and updates==
In 2003, the compacts with the RMI and FSM were renewed for 20 years. These new compacts provided US$3.5 billion in funding for both countries. US$30 million will also be disbursed annually among American Samoa, Guam, Hawaii, and the Northern Mariana Islands in &quot;Compact Impact&quot; funding. This funding helps the governments of these localities cope with the expense of providing services to immigrants from the RMI, FSM, and Palau. The US use of Kwajalein Atoll for missile testing was renewed for the same period. The new compacts also changed certain immigration rules. RMI and FSM citizens traveling to the US are now required to have passports. The US Postal Service was given the option to apply international postage rates for mail between the US and RMI/FSM, phased in over five years. The USPS began implementing the change in January 2006, but decided to resume domestic services and rates in November 2007.

The renewed compact, commonly called &quot;Compact II&quot;, took effect for FSM on June 25, 2004, and for RMI on June 30, 2004.

The economic provisions of the Compact for Palau which provided $18 million in annual subsidies and grants, expired on September 30, 2009, and the renewal talk was concluded in late 2010. US financial support for Palau is based on a continuing resolution passed by the US Congress. The Compact Trust Fund set up to replace US financial aid underperformed because of the Great Recession. The military and civil defense provisions remained until 2015.

An amended Compact, enacted December 17, 2003, as Public Law 108-188, provided financial assistance to the Marshall Islands and Micronesia through 2023. The Compact of Free Association agreement with the Republic of Palau, enshrined in US Public Law 99-658, was followed by a Compact Review Agreement signed between the US and Palau in 2018, extending certain financial provisions through September 30, 2024.

In March 2022, President Joe Biden named Ambassador Joseph Yun as US Special Presidential Envoy for Compact Negotiations to take over negotiation for amendment and continuation of COFA. As of Monday, October 16, 2023, agreements to renew all three compacts for a period of 20 years have been formally signed by representatives of each Freely Associated State (FAS) and the U.S. State Department. Total funding for all three agreements is $7.1B paid over 20 years ($889M - Palau, $3.3B - FSM, $2.3B - RMI and a $634M U.S. Postal Service offset to continue domestic rate mail service).

Palau Finance Minister Kaleb Udui Jr. and U.S. Ambassador Yun signed Palau&#x27;s COFA extension on May 22, 2023, with the island government previously requesting to advance their date more in line with the other two countries. On May 23, 2023, FSM negotiator Leo Falcam and a State Department representative signed Micronesia&#x27;s extension at the U.S. embassy in Pohnpei. Marshall Islands&#x27; Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Jack Ading alongside Ambassador Yun signed RMI&#x27;s agreement on October 16, 2023. Approval by each legislature, to include a funding mechanism in Congress, is the final step to bring each agreement into force. Legislation implementing the new agreements was enacted by the U.S. Congress in March 2024.

==Potential associated states==

The former government of the United States unincorporated territory of Guam, led by Governor Eddie Calvo, campaigned for a plebiscite on Guam&#x27;s future political status, with free association following the model of the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau as one of the possible options.

In Puerto Rico, the &quot;soberanista&quot; movement advocates for the territory to be granted a freely associated status. The 2017 status referendum presented &quot;Independence/Free Association&quot; as an option; if the majority of voters had chosen it, a second round of voting would have been held to choose between free association and full independence. In 2022, the US Congress introduced the Puerto Rico Status Act, which would hold a federally-sponsored referendum on the territory&#x27;s status, with a free association status expected to be presented as an option.

Kiribati is another state that may consider a CFA, as it would be a way to gain immigration access to escape rising sea levels, as it has been a stalwart U.S. ally in the Pacific. Kiribati is home to Tarawa atoll, which is the site of the costly Battle of Tarawa during World War II. The CFA would be a way to give additional options for island difficulties and get extra development aid with limited natural resources, and unify it with other Micronesian people living in the Pacific (this includes FSM, Marshall, Guam, etc.). For example, Marshall Islands and Kiribati already work together on regional security such as 2018 the Marshall ship &quot;Lomor&quot; and performed a joint patrol of their waters.

Other possible CFA states include Nauru. The number of CFA states so far has been limited, because it is reserved for only the closest allies of the US. Although the COFA are very expensive, support for the alliances has been popular in the US, and considered mutually beneficial, with the small island nations warning the US of dangers in the Pacific regions, such as global warming and influence of foreign powers.

Greenland has also been listed as a potential CFA state, following the 2024 US Presidential Election. Rasmus Leander Nielsen of the University of Greenland said that Greenlanders have discussed since the 1980s creating a compact of free association (COFA) with Denmark after independence, and that some have suggested a COFA with the United States instead. Barry Scott Zellen, a scholar of Arctic strategy at the United States Coast Guard Academy, suggested Greenland could become an organized and unincorporated territory of the United States but with a clear pathway to eventual admission as a constituent state &quot;not unlike that which Alaska followed&quot;. According to Zellen, &quot;Greenlandic Inuit, who suffer from a long legacy of neglect and whose colonial experience, despite recent gains in autonomy, has not been entirely positive, may indeed stand to benefit in many ways&quot; from this arrangement.

However, the majority of greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States. In a survey conducted by Verian in Denmark for Berlingske and Sermitsiaq in January 2025, Greenlanders were asked: &quot;Do you want Greenland to leave Denmark and become part of the United States?&quot; The results show that 85% of Greenlanders do not want to leave the Realm and become part of the United States, while 6% want to leave and become part of the US, and 9% are undecided. 

==US fulfillment of commitments ==
The United States&#x27; administration of the former trust territories now covered under the Compacts of Free Association has been subject to ongoing criticism over the past several decades. A 1961 United Nations mission report initially noted deficiencies in &quot;American administration in almost every area: poor transportation, failure to settle war damage claims; failure to adequately compensate for land taken for military purposes; poor living conditions[;] inadequate economic development; inadequate education programs; and almost nonexistent medical care.&quot; In 1971, congresswoman Patsy Mink further noted that &quot;[A]fter winning the right to control Micronesia, [the US] proceeded to allow the islands to stagnate and decay through indifference and lack of assistance. . . . [T]he people are still largely impoverished and lacking in all of the basic amenities which we consider essential – adequate education, housing, good health standards, modern sanitation facilities.&quot;

After the compacts, criticism was also received by the United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific regarding the unfulfilled commitments of the United States to address the impacts of US nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands, which were included as part of the Pacific Proving Grounds. Speakers noted that while section 177 of the Compact of Free Association recognized the United States&#x27; responsibility &quot;to address past, present and future consequences of the nuclear testing claims,&quot; less than $4 million was awarded out of a $2.2 billion judgment rendered by a Nuclear Claims Tribunal created under the RMI Compact, and the United States Court of Claims had dismissed two lawsuits to enforce the judgment. With respect to these unaddressed claims, medical practitioners also noted the potential widespread impacts of nuclear testing within the Pacific Proving Grounds, indicated by the prevalence of both radiogenic diseases, as well as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity associated with &quot;[a] forced change in dietary patterns and lifestyle&quot; resulting from US administration after the testing. In 2011, lawmakers further noted that the US Congress had continuously failed to cover the costs of promised medical care and services to displaced compact citizens who migrate to the United States for health care, education, and employment opportunities, particularly since the passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act.

Questions regarding US responsibility have also been raised regarding the issue of numerous derelict war ships and oil tankers abandoned or destroyed by the US military in atolls and islands throughout the compact area.

==Health care issues==
In 2009, the state of Hawaii, under the administration of then-Governor Linda Lingle, attempted to restrict health care access for Compact citizens by eliminating all Compact residents of Hawaii from Med-QUEST, the state&#x27;s comprehensive Medicaid coverage plan. COFA residents were instead subject to Basic Health Hawaii, a limited health care plan under which &quot;transportation services are excluded and patients can receive no more than ten days of medically necessary inpatient hospital care per year, twelve outpatient visits per year, and a maximum of four medication prescriptions per calendar month. . . . BHH covers dialysis treatments as an emergency medical service only, and the approximate ten to twelve prescription medications dialysis patients take per month are not fully covered. BHH . . . caus[es] cancer patients to exhaust their allotted doctors&#x27; visits within two to three months&quot;.

Noting that such a policy likely constituted unlawful discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, federal District Court Judge John Michael Seabright issued a preliminary injunction against the implementation of Basic Health Hawaii. In finding a high likelihood of irreparable harm, Judge Seabright took note of the &quot;compelling evidence that BHH&#x27;s limited coverage . . . is causing COFA Residents to forego much needed treatment because they cannot otherwise afford it&quot;. Lingle&#x27;s successor, Governor Neil Abercrombie continued the state&#x27;s appeal of the injunction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which ruled in favor of the state. When the United States Supreme Court refused to hear the case, the Abercrombie administration removed most COFA residents from Med-QUEST and transferred them onto Affordable Care Act plans. In other states, notably Arkansas, which has a significant population of Marshallese, COFA residents have not been eligible for Medicaid. In 2020, the United States Congress restored Medicaid eligibility for COFA residents with the Consolidated Appropriations Act.

In 2024, access to COFA members to many federal programs was restored, such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and Supplemental Security Income after it had been dropped in the 1990s after a welfare reform bill. Medicaid had already been restored in 2020.

<doc id="750962" wikidata="Q16030775" url="?curid=750962" title="Libert H. Boeynaems">
<text>Libert H. Boeynaems, formally Libert Hubert John Louis Boeynaems (August 18, 1857 – May 13, 1926) was a Belgian Catholic priest who served as the fourth vicar apostolic of the Vicariate Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands – now the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu.

He was born in Antwerp, Belgium, the son of John Boeynaems and Leopoldina (). He was educated at the Jesuit college of Antwerp and the Major Seminary, Mechelen and finished his scholasticate at the Catholic University of Leuven. Boeynaems was ordained to the priesthood as a member of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary on September 11, 1881.


As part of his missionary work, Boeynaems sailed to the Kingdom of Hawaii arriving in Honolulu on November 29, 1881, to become a pastor in January 1882 to the fledgling Catholic community of native Hawaiians on the island of Kauai in the district encompassing Līhue to Hanalei. He later ministered to those on Kauai in the district encompassing Līhue to Mana. During his first few years in Honolulu, Boeynaems was a witness to the 1893 overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy, proclamation of the Republic of Hawaii and establishment of the United States Territory of Hawaii. In 1895, he was transferred to Wailuku, Maui. 

In December 1902, the Holy See appointed him pro-vicar. On April 8, 1903, he was appointed Vicar Apostolic and was subsequently consecrated titular Bishop of Zeugma in Syria by Archbishop Montgomery in Saint Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in San Francisco on July 25, 1903. On April 11, 1915, Boeynaems consecrated Saint Agnes-in-the-Palms at Kakaako, a former Protestant church at the intersection of Kawaiahao and Kamani streets in Honolulu, to serve the growing population of Portuguese and native Hawaiians in the Kaka‘ako district. During his bishopric he established several schools and orphanages.

After his death, he was buried at the Honolulu Catholic Cemetery in downtown Honolulu near Thomas Square at the intersection of Ward Avenue and King Street.

<text>Homerun () is a 2003 Singaporean period film and comedy film. A remake of the award-winning Iranian film &quot;Children of Heaven&quot;, it is a film about two poor siblings and their adventures over a lost pair of shoes. Set in 1965, the year Singapore separated from Malaysia, and satirises the political relations between the two countries, leading to its banning in Malaysia.

The film was written and directed by Singaporean filmmaker Jack Neo, and produced by Mediacorp Raintree Pictures. It stars Shawn Lee, Megan Zheng, Xiang Yun and Huang Wenyong. Filming took place in the rural outskirts of Kuala Lumpur during November and December 2002, but post-production delays pushed back the film&#x27;s release date.

Released in cinemas on 7 August 2003, the film grossed over S$2.3 million during its nine-week box office run. It was nominated for two awards at the 2003 Golden Horse Awards; Zheng, then 10 years old, became the first Singaporean to win a Golden Horse. Generally, however, critical reception of the film was mixed.

==Plot==
In 1965, two poor Singaporean children, Chew Kiat Kun (Shawn Lee) and his younger sister Chew Seow Fang (Megan Zheng) live with their mother (Xiang Yun) who is late in her third pregnancy and their father (Huang Wenyong) who is in debt to a local rice merchant and provision shop owner (Richard Low). The children make the best of what little they have, while their father works long hours doing odd jobs.

The family&#x27;s problems are compounded when Kiat Kun accidentally loses Seow Fang&#x27;s only pair of shoes after taking them to be repaired. The children conduct a frantic search but find nothing; a karung guni man (Voon Yau Choong) had claimed the shoes as unwanted rubbish. The Chew siblings are frustrated and rendered helpless by the situation until their father inspires Kiat Kun to share his shoes with his sister, trading off between classes so they can both attend school. Unfortunately, this plan brings additional problems: Seow Fang is chastised for wearing oversized shoes to school, while Kiat Kun is repeatedly late as he must wait for his sister to exchange shoes with him.

At school, a wealthy schoolmate of Kiat Kun&#x27;s named Tan Beng Soon (Joshua Ang) runs an amateur football team with his friends. Kiat Kun and his friends strike a bargain with Beng Soon to play on the team using the other boys&#x27; football shoes, in exchange for helping them cheat on their homework. However, the boys quarrel, causing an angry Beng Soon to renege on the deal and remove Kiat Kun and his friends from the team.

Without their assistance, Beng Soon and his friends are punished for producing substandard homework. Although the boys try to resolve their differences, they eventually give up on reaching an agreement, and Beng Soon&#x27;s Mathematics results continue to fall, which resulted his Form Teacher and Mathematics Teacher named Mrs. Ang (Patricia Mok) to persuade his father and mother Mr. Tan and Mrs. Tan (Jack Neo and Phoena Lee) down to school to witness Beng Soon&#x27;s private caning inside the staff room before his parents scolded him for his poor performance in studies in school due to football training. His father ultimately decided to send him away to study in England. Kiat Kun, on the other hand, is often late, so the headmaster decides to expel him, but he was accepted again thanks to his Form Teacher who coincidentally happens to be their Mathematics Teacher&#x27;s (Marcus Chin)&#x27;s defense, acknowledging his dire family background.

Meanwhile, Seow Fang sees her classmate wearing her lost shoes to school. She and Kiat Kun follow the girl home, but after realising her father is blind and that her family was in a more dire situation than theirs, they decide not to reclaim the shoes. However, a few days later, Seow Fang notices that her classmate is wearing a new pair; upon confronting her, she discovers that the girl has discarded the old pair at the kampong rubbish dump. The Chew siblings frantically search the rubbish dump for her shoes, but only discover them as they are destroyed during a trade unionist riot against a police officer (Wakin Chau).
Kiat Kun is dejected until he learns that the third prize in the 1965 National Primary School Cross Country Competition is a pair of shoes. Because he was sick on the day his school selected representatives for the race, he pleads with his P.E. teacher (Mark Lee) to let him enter. The P.E. teacher, initially reluctant, relents when Kiat Kun rushes to get his cough medicine, demonstrating his running ability. As the competition begins, Kiat Kun notices that Beng Soon is also participating.

Once the starting gun fires, Kiat Kun pushes himself to the limit and eventually establishes himself among the lead runners. Kiat Kun appears assured of third place, but unexpectedly trips over a stone and thus finishes first. Beng Soon ends the race in third place. While Kiat Kun is running, Mrs Chew goes into labour, forcing Seow Fang to run across a long path littered with broken glass to find a midwife. Finally, Mrs Chew gives birth to a baby boy, and the birth happened right on the same day Singapore became independent from Malaysia, and some time later, Beng Soon gives Kiat Kun and Seow Fang new pairs of shoes before departing for London, as a sign of reconciliation between him and the siblings.

==Production and distribution==
While watching the Iranian film &quot;Children of Heaven&quot;, Singaporean filmmaker Jack Neo and his wife were moved to &quot;holding hands and crying after seeing the love shared by the children&quot;. He then decided to adapt the Iranian film to a 1960s Singaporean kampong setting, to emphasise the messages of friendship and kinship, in which he named the film known as &quot;Homerun&quot;.
This film was produced by Raintree Pictures on a budget of S$1.5 million. It was shot on 35mm film.
The production crew included Titus Ho as executive producer; Chan Pui Yin and Daniel Yun as producers; Kane Chen as cinematographer and Lawrence Ang as film editor. In addition to writing and directing, Neo also penned the lyrics to the theme song, which was sung by Koh Mei Xian and composed by Li Yi. Filming took place in the rural outskirts of Sungai Muntoh during November and December 2002. The cast endured a rigorous schedule, including extensive travel times to the filming location and many running scenes. The child actors&#x27; school commitments made the planning of reshoots difficult; moreover, the production team decided to delay post-production work in Thailand due to the SARS outbreak.

On 7 August 2003, distributor United International Pictures released the film in 37 theatres, at the time a record for a Singaporean film. The film&#x27;s worldwide theatrical distribution was carried out by the production company, Mediacorp Raintree Pictures, while the Hong Kong screenings were carried out by Golden Scene. A Chinese language version was released as both a two-disc VCD and one-disc DVD by Panorama Entertainment, one of the Hong Kong-based &quot;mainstays&quot; of independent film distribution.

==Political commentary==

Elements of this film compare and contrast Singapore&#x27;s situations in 1965 and in 2003. For example, while Mrs Chew is giving birth, the then first Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew&#x27;s voice can be heard on a radio in the background, announcing Singapore&#x27;s separation from Malaysia. Other events in the film parallel those in Singapore&#x27;s history, such as the riot at the rubbish dump alluding to the labour strikes and riots of the 1960s, as well as the threat of terrorism in the new millennium. One of Kiat Kun&#x27;s friends is nicknamed &quot;Little Red Dot&quot;, a phrase used by former Indonesian president Jusuf Habibie to disparage Singapore. The final scene in the film shows the Chew siblings standing before a long muddy path, which symbolises the uncertainty faced by both the newly independent nation in 1965 and the country in transition in 2003.

A number of scenes in this film contain references to political disputes between Singapore and Malaysia. The water dispute is portrayed by Kiat Kun (Singapore) quarrelling with Beng Soon (Malaysia) over the right to draw water from the kampung well. In another scene, one of Kiat Kun&#x27;s friends produces a sheet of paper with details of the deal Beng Soon reneged on, prompting one of Beng Soon&#x27;s friends to remark that this was like &quot;writing a letter to a girlfriend and revealing it to the world&quot;. This echoes a comment made by the then Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, comparing Singapore&#x27;s disclosure of letters between the two countries to &quot;revealing letters sent to one&#x27;s girlfriend&quot;.

When asked about the references, Neo said he would &quot;leave the movie open to interpretation, which will make it more mysterious and beautiful&quot;. Nevertheless, Malaysian censors decided to ban the screening of this film in Malaysia, citing scenes that will &quot;bring about negative elements and bad examples to education&quot;. Raintree filed an appeal, arguing that the positive messages in the film were more salient than the political satire, but it was unsuccessful. Malaysian moviegoers polled by &quot;Life!&quot; and the &quot;China Press&quot; expressed disappointment with the ban, calling it &quot;unnecessary&quot; and stated a desire to watch the film via unlicensed VCD.

==Reception==

Having earned S$110,300 from sneak previews, and the film made S$610,400 over the National Day weekend, achieving the most successful opening weekend for a local film. It rose to the top of the local box office, beating American blockbusters such as &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot;. In total, the film grossed more than S$2.3 million over nine weeks of screenings, the second longest box office run for the year.

Critical reception of this film was mixed. Sanjuro of LoveHKFilm.com wrote that the film &quot;succeeds in delivering a relatively simple, intimate story that should prove moving for even the most jaded audience&quot;, while Nick England of the San Diego Asian Film Foundation described this film as &quot;a film with certain beauteous qualities that we can genuinely enjoy, but end up choking on when it is all over with&quot;. In contrast, FilmsAsia reviewer Soh Yun-Huei panned its use of political satire, which she felt &quot;[causes] the film to be devoid of innocence and replaced with a sense of agenda and manipulation&quot;.

The film won several awards, including the Grand Prix Prize at the 2003 Golden Swan Awards, the Golden Butterfly Prize for Best Direction at the Isfahan International Children&#x27;s Film Festival, and a trio (Best Director, Best Newcomer, and People&#x27;s Choice Award) at the Montreal World Film Festival. It also received two nominations at the 2003 Golden Horse Awards, for Best Theme Song (拥有) and Best New Performer. Megan Zheng, then 10 years old, became the first Singaporean to win a Golden Horse Award, sharing her Best New Performer award with Wang Baoqiang of &quot;Blind Shaft&quot;.

<text>Greek Americans ( &quot;Ellinoamerikanoí&quot; &quot;Ellinoamerikánoi&quot; ) are Americans of full or partial Greek ancestry. There is an estimate of 1.2 million Americans of full or partial Greek ancestry. According to the US census, 264,066 people older than five spoke Greek at home in 2019.

Greek Americans have the highest concentrations in the New York City, Boston, and Chicago regions, but have settled in major metropolitan areas across the United States. In 2000, Tarpon Springs, Florida, was home to the highest per capita representation of Greek Americans in the country (just over 10%). The United States is home to the largest number of Greeks outside of Greece, followed by Cyprus and Australia.

Within the New York City region, Astoria, Queens contains an abundant Greek community and an official Greektown. Officially city-designated Greektowns exist in Chicago, Detroit, and Tarpon Springs in the Tampa area. Greek community enclaves have been found in other metropolitan areas, such as in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and rural areas such as Campbell, Ohio are home to Greek enclaves. There are also strong Greek communities in Boston, the Salt Lake Valley, and in North Carolina, especially Charlotte and Asheville areas.

==History==

===Early history===
The first Greek to ever set foot in America was Johan Griego (), in 1492. He was a member of Christopher Columbus&#x27;s first expedition. At least two other Greeks followed soon; they were brothers who sailed with Columbus in his second (1493) and third (1498) expeditions. Spanish and English historians mention three Greeks who sailed with Ferdinand Magellan in 1520 on his voyage to Patagonia. Their names are listed as: &quot;Nikolao&quot;, &quot;Ioanni&quot;, and &quot;Mattheo&quot;.

Another Greek, Don Doroteo Teodoro, was a sailor who landed in Boca Ciega Bay at the Jungle Prada site in present-day St. Petersburg, Florida with the Narváez expedition in 1528. He was instrumental in building the rafts that the expedition survivors built and sailed from present-day St. Mark&#x27;s River in Florida until they were shipwrecked near Galveston Island, Texas. Teodoro had been captured by natives as they sailed along the Gulf coast shoreline toward the west, and was never seen again. He was presumably killed by the natives. Don Doroteo Teodoro is regarded as the first Greek to have set foot on soil which is today part of the United States. Pedro de Candia (, a Greek adventurer and soldier from Crete, is known for being a lieutenant of Francisco Pizarro who conquered the empire of Peru and founded the city of Lima.

When Francis Drake reached Valparaiso, Chile in 1578 he found there a Greek pilot, whose name was Ioannis. loannis acted as Drake&#x27;s pilot as far as Lima, Peru. Ten years later, Thomas Cavendish met a Greek pilot by the name of Georgio, who knew the waters of Chile. Both of these Greek pilots must have been in the area for many years in order to have sufficient knowledge of the waters to act as pilots for visiting ships.

In 1592, Greek captain Juan de Fuca (original name: Ioannis Fokas or Apostolos Valerianos) sailed up the Pacific coast under the Spanish flag, in search of the fabled Northwest Passage between the Pacific and the Atlantic. He reported discovering a body of water, a strait which today bears his name: the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which today forms part of the Canada–United States border.

There is a report that a Cretan Greek named Konopios operated a coffeehouse in New England in 1652. Records show that a Greek, Michael Dry (Youris), became a naturalized citizen by act of the General Assembly of Maryland in 1725. This makes Dry the first Greek positively known to reside permanently in what is today the United States.

About 500 Greeks from Smyrna, Crete, and Mani settled in New Smyrna Beach, Florida in 1768. The colony was unsuccessful, and the settlers moved to St. Augustine in 1776. In November 1777, a Greek chapel was established in St. Augustine, where Greeks could pray with their own rites. Almost 200 years later, the chapel was designated the St. Photios Greek Orthodox National Shrine by the Greek Orthodox Church, and it exists today as a remnant of their presence, having been built atop the site of the Avero House, itself believed to be the first site of Greek Orthodox worship in the United States.

The first noted Greek American scholar was John Paradise. He was persuaded to immigrate to America by Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, whom he met in Europe. Paradise married into the notable Ludwell family, one of the most prominent colonial families in Virginia.

Evstratii Delarov, a native of the Peloponnese, was the first documented Greek explorer and merchant to arrive in Alaska. From 1783 to 1791, he was in charge of all Russian trading operations in the Aleutian Islands and in Alaska. He is today considered to have been the first &quot;de facto&quot; Governor of Alaska.
Early records show Michel Dragon (Michalis Dracos) and Andrea Dimitry (Andrea Drussakis Demetrios) settled in New Orleans around 1799. Michel Dragon was a lieutenant in the American Revolution and Andrea Dimitry participated in the War of 1812. Andrea married Michel Dragon&#x27;s daughter, Marianne Celeste Dragon, and established a small community in New Orleans. The marriage between them in 1799 was the first known marriage between Greeks in America. His son was United States ambassador to Costa Rica &amp; Nicaragua Alexander Dimitry. Another Greek refugee named George Marshall also came to the United States around this period. He was born in Rhodes in 1782. Marshall joined the United States Navy in 1809 and he wrote &quot;Marshall&#x27;s Practical Marine Gunnery&quot;. Marshall had a successful naval career and became master gunner. His son George J Marshall also served in the navy. His son-in-law was George Sirian. Due to problems with the strait of Gibraltar, America was desperate for trade with Europe. Pirates ransomed Americans which led to two Barbary wars. America eventually formed the Mediterranean Squadron.

=== 19th century ===
Many American ships traveled to the Ottoman Empire, namely Ayvalık. The Greek War of Independence began in 1821 and lasted until 1830. Americans established missionaries in Greece. The missionaries included Jonas King. Prominent American abolitionists Samuel Gridley Howe and Jonathan Peckham Miller participated in the Greek War. Jonathan Peckham Miller adopted Greek orphan Lucas M. Miller. Samuel Gridley Howe also collected a number of refugees and brought them back to Boston. Some of the refugees he brought included John Celivergos Zachos and author Christophorus Plato Castanis.

New England and Boston became home to countless Greek refugees during the 1820s. Some of them were: Author Petros Mengous, Photius Fisk, Gregory Anthony Perdicaris, Evangelinos Apostolides Sophocles, George Colvocoresses, Garafilia Mohalbi. There was a large Greek presence at Mount Pleasant Classical Institute and other local universities. There were hundreds of Greek orphans that arrived in New England. Some drastically contributed to the United States of America. The Greek Slave Movement was initiated by Boston abolitionists.

The Greek Slave Movement started in the 1820s during the influx of young refugees to New England. The movement contributed to countless paintings, sculptures, poems, essays, and songs. The death of Greek slave Garafilia Mohalbi was a trigger for sympathy. She was featured in many poems and songs. The Greek Slave Movement was so popular in American media that sculptor Hiram Powers created The Greek Slave. The Greek Slave Movement was an abolitionist tool to abolish slavery in the United States. The theme eventually exploded some examples include: The Slave Market (Gérôme painting), The Slave Market (Boulanger painting), and the slave Market Otto Pilny. Some of the young Greek refugees became abolitionists.

John Celivergos Zachos became a prominent educator. He was also a woman&#x27;s rights activist and abolitionist. Photius Fisk was another abolitionist who fought for the anti-slavery cause. Gregory Anthony Perdicaris was a wealthy millionaire who created the framework for gas and electric companies. George Colvocoresses was a captain in the United States Navy. Colvos Passage is named after him. George Sirian was another seaman in the United States Navy. The George Sirian Meritorious Service Award is named after him. Harvard created an entire department for Evangelinos Apostolides Sophocles. Greek orphan Lucas Miltiades Miller became a U.S. Congressman.

In the American Civil War, Greek Americans fought for both sides, Union and Confederate, with prominent Greeks such as George Colvocoresses, John Celivergos Zachos and Photius Fisk taking part in the war on the side of the Union. A Greek Company within the Confederate Louisiana Militia was formed for Greeks who fought for the Confederate States of America.

After the Civil War, the Greek community continued to flourish in New Orleans, Louisiana. By 1866, the community was numerous and prosperous enough to have a Greek consulate and the first official Greek Orthodox Church in the United States. During that period, most Greek immigrants to the New World came from Asia Minor and those Aegean Islands still under Ottoman rule. By 1890, there were almost 15,000 Greeks living in the U.S.

Immigration picked up again in the 1890s and early 20th century, due largely to economic opportunity in the U.S., displacement caused by the hardships of Ottoman rule, the Balkan Wars, and World War I. Most of these immigrants had come from southern Greece, especially from the Peloponnesian provinces of Laconia and Arcadia. 450,000 Greeks arrived to the States between 1890 and 1917, most working in the cities of the northeastern United States; others labored on railroad construction and in mines of the western United States; another 70,000 arrived between 1918 and 1924. Each wave of immigration contributed to the growth of Hellenism in the U.S.

Greek immigration at this time was over 90% male, contrasted with most other European immigration to the U.S., such as Italian and Irish immigration, which averaged 50% to 60% male. Many Greek immigrants expected to work and return to their homeland after earning capital and dowries for their families. However, the loss of their homeland due to the Greek genocide and the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey, which displaced 1,500,000 Greeks from Anatolia, Eastern Thrace, and Pontus caused the initial economic immigrants to reside permanently in America. The Greeks were de jure denaturalized from their homelands and lost the right to return, and their families were made refugees. Additionally, the first widely implemented U.S. immigration limits against non Western European immigrants were made in 1924, creating an impetus for immigrants to apply for citizenship, bring their families and permanently settle in the U.S. Fewer than 30,000 Greek immigrants arrived in the U.S. between 1925 and 1945, most of whom were &quot;picture brides&quot; for single Greek men and family members coming over to join relatives.

===20th century===
In 1909, there was a pogrom against the Greek population in South Omaha.

The events of the early 1920s also provided the stimulus for the first permanent national Greek American religious and civic organizations. In 1922, as a response to the anti-Greek campaign and actions of the Ku Klux Klan, the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association was founded, which sought to organize and Americanize the Greek immigrant in America. Anti-immigrant sentiment, particularly among newspapers owned by William Randolph Hearst, provided the background to sensational trials in the 1920s, including the conviction of Alexander Pantages, Greek immigrant and movie theater pioneer, in 1929. His 50-year prison sentence was later overturned.

Greeks again began to arrive in large numbers after 1945, fleeing the economic devastation caused by World War II and the Greek Civil War. From 1945 until 1982, approximately 211,000 Greeks immigrated to the United States. These later immigrants were less influenced by the powerful assimilation pressures of the 1920s and 1930s and revitalized Greek American identity, especially in areas such as Greek-language media.

Greek immigrants founded more than 600 diners in the New York metropolitan area in the 1950s through the 1970s. Immigration to the United States from Greece peaked between the 1950s and 1970. After the 1981 admission of Greece to the European Union, annual U.S. immigration numbers fell to less than 2,000. In recent years, Greek immigration to the United States has been minimal; in fact, net migration has been towards Greece. Over 72,000 U.S. citizens currently live in Greece (1999); most of them are Greek Americans.

The predominant religion among Greeks and Greek Americans is Greek Orthodox Christianity. There are also a number of Americans who descend from Greece&#x27;s smaller Sephardic and Romaniote Jewish communities.

===21st century===
In the aftermath of the Greek financial crisis, there has been a resurgence of Greek immigration to New York City since 2010, accelerating in 2015, and centered upon the traditional Greek enclave of Astoria, Queens. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, this new wave of Greek migration to New York City is not being driven as much by opportunities in New York City as it is by a lack of economic options in Greece itself. In December 2022, the $85 million, newly rebuilt St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church opened in Lower Manhattan, 21 years after being destroyed in the September 11 attacks.

The &quot;Atlantis&quot; (1894–1973) was the first successful Greek-language daily newspaper published in the United States. The newspaper was founded in 1894 by Solon J. and Demetrius J. Vlasto, descendants of the Greek noble family, Vlasto. The paper was headed by a member of the Vlasto family until it closed in 1973. Published in New York City, it had a national circulation and influence. &quot;Atlantis&quot; supported the royalist faction in Greek politics until the mid-1960s. &quot;Atlantis&quot; editorial themes included naturalization, war relief, Greek-American business interests, and Greek religious unity.

, &quot;Ethnikos Kyrix&quot; (, 1915–) is the only Greek-language daily publication based in the United States. Headquartered in New York City, its articles focus on the Greek diaspora in the United States as well as current events in Greece and Cyprus. In contrast to its competitor &quot;Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Ethnikos Kyrix&quot; historically supported liberal causes in Greece and America, including the progressive forces of Eleftherios Venizelos in Greece and the New Deal stateside. A companion weekly edition &quot;The National Herald&quot; (1997–) is in circulation and features similar content presented in English. The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America publishes the monthly &quot;Orthodox Observer&quot; (1934–) in both Greek and English for news and information regarding the Greek Orthodox Church as a whole, as well as its American parishes.

Any person who is ethnically Greek born outside of Greece may become a Greek citizen through naturalization by proving that a parent or grandparent was born as a national of Greece. The Greek ancestor&#x27;s birth certificate and marriage certificate are required, along with the applicant&#x27;s birth certificate and the birth certificates of all generations in between until the relation between the applicant and the person with Greek citizenship is proven.

==Organizations==

There are hundreds of regional, religious and professional Greek American organizations. Some of the largest and most notable include:
* The American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association (AHEPA) is the largest community organization of Greek Americans. It was founded in Atlanta, Georgia in 1922 to counter the anti-Greek attacks by the Ku Klux Klan during that time period. Its current membership exceeds 28,000. 385 active chapters are located in the United States with additional chapters in Canada, and Europe. AHEPA maintains a full-time staff at the AHEPA Global Headquarters located in Washington, DC www.ahepa.org
* The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America is the religious organization most closely associated with the Greek American community. It was established in 1921, and is under the leadership of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The church operates the Greek Orthodox Youth of America, the largest Orthodox Christian youth group in the United States.
* The American Hellenic Institute, an advocacy group for Greek Americans, and its lobbying arm, the American Hellenic Institute Public Affairs Committee.
* The Next Generation Initiative, a foundation that works with prominent Greek American leaders and executives to offer educational opportunities such as internships and master classes through a network of more than 5,500 Greek American students and 2,500 professors on 200+ college campuses.
* The Council of Hellenes Abroad is a Greek government sponsored umbrella organization for Greek immigrant organizations worldwide.
* The Hellenic Society Paideia has been promoting Hellenism and Orthodoxy since 1977 by placing Greek and Byzantium classes in high schools and universities, offering study abroad programs to Greece year round, and with various building projects throughout the country. Anywhere from 200 to 500 students travel to Greece with Paideia per year. Information specifically for the study abroad programs can be found at www.hellenicstudiespaideia.org Currently &quot;Paideia&quot; is constructing a Classical Greek Amphitheater at the University of Connecticut and a Center for Hellenic Studies at the University of Rhode Island.
* The National Hellenic Student Association (NHSA) is the independent network of the Hellenic Student Associations (HSAs) across the United States. By linking all the Greek, Greek-American and Cypriot students of the American educational institutions, the organization can promote ideas and projects and enrich the Hellenic spirit on campuses nationwide.
* Many &quot;topika somatéa&quot; (local councils) or clubs representing the local regional homeland of Greeks in America. Among the scores of such clubs, larger &quot;umbrella&quot; organizations include the Pan Macedonian Association (one example is the Drosopigi Society, in Rochester, New York, hailing from the village of Drosopigi in Northern Greece outside of the city of Florina) the Panepirotic Federation, the Pan Cretan Association, the Pan-Icarian Brotherhood, the Pan Pontian Federation of U.S.A-Canada, the Chios Societies of America &amp; Canada, the Cyprus Federation of America, the Pan-Laconian Federation of the USA &amp; Canada, the Pan-Messinian Federation of the USA &amp; Canada, the Pan-Arcadian Federation of America and several associations of refugees from areas in the former Ottoman territories.

<doc id="750970" wikidata="Q842370" url="?curid=750970" title="Epic of King Gesar">
<text>The Epic of King Gesar (), also spelled Kesar () or Geser (especially in Mongolian contexts), is an epic from Tibet and Central Asia. It originally developed between 200 or 300 BCE and about 600 CE. Folk balladeers continued to pass on the story orally; this enriched the plot and embellished the language. The story reached its final form and height of popularity in the early 12th century.

The epic relates the heroic deeds of the culture hero Gesar, the fearless lord of the legendary kingdom of Ling (). It is recorded variously in poetry and prose, through oral poetry performance, and is sung widely throughout Central Asia and South Asia. Its classic version is found in central Tibet.

Some 100 bards of this epic (, &quot;tale&quot;) are still active today in the Gesar belt of China. Tibetan, Mongolian, Buryat, Balti, Ladakhi, and Monguor singers maintain the oral tradition, and the epic has attracted intense scholarly curiosity as one of the few oral epic traditions to survive as a performing art. Yugur and Salar versions of the epic are also recorded among the Balti of Baltistan, the Burusho people of Hunza and Gilgit, and the Kalmyk and Ladakhi people in Nepal, and among various Altai, Turkic, and Tungus tribes. The first printed version was a Mongolian text published in Beijing in 1716.

There is a large number of versions, each with many variants, reputed by some to be the longest in the world. Although there is no one definitive text, the Chinese compilation of its Tibetan versions so far has filled some 120 volumes; it consists of more than one million verses divided into 29 &quot;chapters&quot;. Western calculations speak of more than 50 different books edited so far in China, India, and Tibet.

==Etymology of the title==
It has been proposed on the basis of phonetic similarities that the name &quot;Gesar&quot; reflects the Roman title &quot;Caesar,&quot; and that the intermediary for the transmission of this imperial title from Rome to Tibet may have been a Turkic language, since &quot;kaiser&quot; (emperor) entered Turkic through contact with the Byzantine Empire, where Caesar () was an imperial title. The medium for this transmission may have been via Mongolian &quot;Kesar&quot;. The Mongols were allied with the Byzantines.
Numismatic evidence and some accounts speak of a Bactrian ruler &quot;Phrom-kesar&quot;, specifically the Kabul Shahi of Gandhara, which was ruled by the Turkic king &quot;Fromo Kesaro&quot; (&quot;Caesar of Rome&quot;), who was father-in-law of the king of the Kingdom of Khotan around the middle of the 8th century CE.
In early Bon sources, &quot;From Kesar&quot; is always a place name, and never refers, as it does later, to a ruler. In some Tibetan versions of the epic, a king named &quot;Phrom&quot; Ge-sar or &quot;Khrom&quot; Ge-sar figures as one of the kings of the four directions – the name is attested in the 10th century and this &quot;Phrom&quot;/&quot;Khrom&quot; preserves an Iranian form (*&quot;frōm-hrōm&quot;) for &quot;Rūm&quot;/&quot;Rome&quot;. This eastern Iranian word lies behind the Middle Chinese word for (Eastern) Rome (, &quot;Fólín&quot;), namely Byzantium (&quot;phrōm-from&lt;*phywət-lyəm&gt;&quot;).

A. H. Francke thought the Tibetan name Gesar derived from Sanskrit. S.K. Chatterji, introducing his work, noted that the Ladakh variant of Kesar, &quot;Kyesar&quot;, in Classical Tibetan &quot;Skye-gsar&quot; meant &#x27;reborn/newly born&#x27;, and that &quot;Gesar/Kesar&quot; in Tibetan, as in Sanskrit signifies the &#x27;anther or pistil of a flower&#x27;, corresponding to Sanskrit &quot;kēsara,&quot; whose root &#x27;kēsa&#x27; (hair) is Indo-European.

==Gesar and the Kingdom of Ling==
In Tibet, the existence of Gesar as a historical figure is rarely questioned. 
Some scholars there argued he was born in 1027, on the basis of a note in a 19th-century chronicle, the &quot;Mdo smad chos &#x27;byung&quot; by Brag dgon pa dkon mchog bstan pa rab. Certain core episodes seem to reflect events recorded at the dawn of Tibetan history: the marriage to a Chinese princess is reminiscent of legends concerning king Songtsän Gampo&#x27;s alliance marriage with Princess Wencheng in 641, for example. Legends variously place him in Golok,
between Dotō and Domé,
or in Markham, Tanak, Öyuk or the village of Panam on the Nyang River. Given that the mythological and allegorical elements of the story defy place and time, the historicity of figures in the cycle is indeterminate. Though the epic was sung all over Tibetan-speaking regions, with Kham and Amdo long regarded as the centres for its diffusion,
traditions do connect Gesar with the former Kingdom of Ling (). In Tibetan, &quot;gling&quot; means &quot;island&quot; but can have, as with the Sanskrit word dvīpa, the secondary meaning of &quot;continent&quot;. Ling was a petty kingdom located in Kham between the Yangtze and Yalong River. The Gsumge Mani Stone Castle located near the source of Yalong River houses a shrine dedicated to Gesar at its centre. A historical kingdom of Lingtsang () existed until the 20th century.

==Growth of the epic==

The success of the Turk &quot;Fromo Kesaro&quot;, whose name is a Persian pronunciation of &quot;Rome (Byzantium) Caesar&quot;, in overwhelming an intrusive Arab army in Gandhara sometime between 739 and 745, may have formed the historic core behind the Gesar epic in Tibet. In the records of the earliest rulers of Ladakh, Baltistan, and Gilgit, whose countries were later overrun by Tibetans, royal ancestry is connected to the Bactrian Gesar.

In its distinctive Tibetan form, the epic appears to date from the time of the second transmission of Buddhism to Tibet marked by the formation of the Sarma or &quot;new schools&quot; of Tibetan Buddhism, although the story includes early elements taken from Indian tantricism. The oral tradition of this epic is most prominent in the two remote areas associated with the pre-Buddhist ethnic religion known as Bon (Ladakh and Zanskar in the far west of Tibet and Kham and Amdo in the east), strongly suggesting that the story has native roots. However, the oral versions known to us today are not, according to R. A. Stein, earlier than the written versions, but rather depend on them.

As an oral tradition, a large number of variants have always existed, and no canonical text can be written. However, the epic narrative was certainly in something similar to its present form by the 15th century at the latest as shown by the mentions in the &quot;rLangs-kyi Po-ti bSe-ru&quot; by &quot;Byang chub rgyal mtshan.&quot; Despite the age of the tradition, the oldest extant text of the epic is actually the Mongolian woodblock print commissioned by the Kangxi Emperor of Qing China in 1716. None of the Tibetan texts that have come down to us are earlier than the 18th century, although they are likely based on older texts that have not survived. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries a woodblock printing of the story was compiled by a scholar-monk from Ling-tsang, a small kingdom northeast of Derge, with inspiration from the prolific Tibetan philosopher Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso.

The wide variety of cultures in which the Gesar epic is encountered means that the name for the hero varies. In Tibetan legends Gesar is variously called &quot;Gesar of Ling&quot;, &quot;Ling Gesar&quot;, and &quot;Gesar Norbu Dradul&quot;. Among the Buryat he is known as &quot;Abai Geser Khubun&quot;. The Khalkha oral version calls him &quot;Altan Bogdo khan.&quot; An Altai version calls him &quot;Sädängkäi Käsär&quot; and &quot;Sartaktai Käsär&quot;. Among the Balti and Ladakhi people he is most famously known as Gyalpo Kaiserr.

===Story and narrative motifs===
The epic has a vast number of variants in plot and motifs, but the core of the story, similar to that of many legendary cycles, has been summed up as follows:
King Ge-sar has a miraculous birth, a despised and neglected childhood, and then becomes ruler and wins his (first) wife &#x27;Brug-mo through a series of marvellous feats. In subsequent episodes he defends his people against various external aggressors, human and superhuman. Instead of dying a normal death he departs into a hidden realm from which he may return at some time in the future to save his people from their enemies.

For Samuels, the Gesar epic lies towards the shamanic pole in the continuum of Tibetan culture and religion, which he sees as evincing a constant tension between &#x27;clerical&#x27; and &#x27;shamanic&#x27; Buddhism, the latter grounded in its earlier Bon substrate. (; )
The received versions of the Ge-sar cycle are thickly overlaid with Buddhist ideas and motifs, and detecting the original &#x27;heroic&#x27; form is difficult. Historical analysis to sift out an ancient core narrative winnows the archaic folkloric leitmotifs from features that show distinct and historically identifiable Buddhist influences. Samuel, comparing three Gesar traditions, Mongolian, Eastern Tibetan and Ladakhi, that developed relatively autonomously, postulates the following core narrative shared by all three:

* (1) The &quot;Lha gling&quot; episode.
* (2) The &quot;′Khrungs gling&quot; episode.
* (3) The &quot;rTa rgyugs&quot; episode.
* (4) The &quot;bDud &#x27;dul&quot; episode.
* (5) The &quot;Hor gling&quot; episode.
* (6) The China journey episode.

To which one might add:
* (7) The &quot;Srid pa&#x27;i le&#x27;u&quot; cosmogenic prelude.

===Tibetan versions===

Tibetan versions differ very greatly in details. Often Buddhist motifs are conspicuous, with episodes on the creation of the world and Tibet&#x27;s cosmic origins. In other variants, Gautama Buddha is never mentioned, or a certain secular irony is voiced against the national religion. According to Samten Karmay, Gesar arose as the hero of a society still thinly permeated by Buddhism and the earlier myths associate him with pre-Buddhist beliefs like the mountain cult. In most episodes, Gesar fights against the enemies of &quot;dharma&quot;, an old warrior ethos, where physical power, courage, a combative spirit, and qualities such as cunning and deceit prevail.

* Cosmic prelude and Tibet&#x27;s early history: One motif explains how the world collapsed into anarchy; numerous demon kings () had avoided subjection. As a result, hordes of cannibalistic demons and goblins, led by malignant and greedy rulers of many kingdoms, wreak havoc. Tibet&#x27;s conversion from barbarity to Buddhism under the three great Dharma Kings often features. Episodes relate how Padmasambhāva (also known as Guru Rinpoche) subdued Tibet&#x27;s violent native spirits.
* Gesar&#x27;s miraculous or mundane birth: In one account, he was fatherless, like Padmasambhava, who assists his celestial creation by creating a nagini who then serves the king of Ling, and is impregnated by drinking a magic potion, and is born from his mother&#x27;s head, like Athena in Greek mythology. In another version he is conceived by his mother after she drinks water impressed with his image. Alternatively, he is born from the union of a father, who is simultaneously skygod and holy mountain, and of a mother who is a goddess of the watery underworld, or he is born, Chori, in the lineage of Ling in the Dza Valley, to the king Singlen Gyalpo and his spouse Lhakar Drönma of Gog.
* Relatives: He has a half-brother, and two uncles. One uncle is the &quot;old hawk&quot; (), the wise elder of Ling, who supports the child; the other, the cowardly and greedy Khrothung, sees the child as a threat and tries to do him ill. Khrothung is portrayed comically, but his role as provocateur is absolutely central.
* His early years: Gesar&#x27;s mission as a divine emissary is to vanquish powerful demons on earth. Until his adolescence he is depicted as black, ugly, nasty, snotty, and troublesome. His paternal uncle, or the king&#x27;s brother Todong, banishes both son and mother to the rMa plateau, where he grows up living a feral life, with the child clothed in animal skins and wearing a hat with antelope horns.
* Horse race and kingship: When he is 12, a horse race is held whose winner will marry &#x27;Brugmo, the beautiful daughter of a neighbouring chieftain, and become king of Ling. Returning to Ling, Gesar wins the race, marries &#x27;Brugmo, and ascends the golden throne. His victory marks his coming of age; he proclaims himself &quot;the Great Lion, Wish-fulfilling Jewel, Subduer of Foes,&quot; and takes the name Gesar. Mounted on his miraculous steed &quot;Kyang Go Karkar,&quot; he subsequently wages military campaigns, together with 30 companions, against the frontier countries that represent evil.
* The kidnapping of &#x27;Brugmo: While Gesar is away on his first campaign (against Klu btsan, the man-eating demon of the north), his wife is kidnapped by Gurdkar ( &quot;white tent&quot;), the King of Hor. Upon his return, Gesar uses magic to infiltrate Gurdkar&#x27;s palace, kills him, and retrieves his wife.
* Two further campaigns: Gesar wages war against King Sadam of &#x27;Jang (sometimes located in Yunnan), and king Shingkhri of Mon (Mon is often located in the southern Himalayas and remained the term for &quot;barbarian borderlands&quot; until recently).
* The 18 fortresses (): Gesar sets out to conquer the 18 great forts (). They are listed differently according to singers and texts, but these battles nearly always include Tajik () and Khache Muslim adversaries.
* Lhasa: Some versions say that, aged 39, he made a retreat on Red Hill (), where the Potala Palace was later built.
* Old age: When Gesar reaches his eighties, he briefly descends to Hell as a last episode before he leaves the land of men and ascends once more to his celestial paradise.

===Mongolian version (1716)===
* Opens with a heavenly prologue, Ge-ser&#x27;s birth, youth, marriage to &quot;Rogmo&quot; and his obtaining the kingship of Ling.
* Geser defeats a black striped tiger.
* Geser&#x27;s voyage to China where he marries a Chinese princess.
* Geser&#x27;s defeat of the demon king, with the help of the latter&#x27;s wife.
* Geser&#x27;s war against the three kings of &quot;Sharaigol&quot; (Hor)
* Geser&#x27;s defeat of a demon who assumed the guise of a lama.
* Geser&#x27;s descent to hell to rescue his mother.

There is a 2017 version of this translated into English.

===Buryat version===
Buryat versions of the epic focus mainly on Gesar&#x27;s battles with various demons, rather than on military campaigns. They also contain a detailed and drastically different prologue to Gesar&#x27;s exploits. According to these versions, the great Tengri Khormusta (Turmas, Khorbustu, Hormust) khan of the celestial tribes of the West waged war with Atai Ulan, khan of the malicious gods of the east. After his victory, Khormusta dismembers Atai Ulan to prevent his resurrection and throws his body parts to Earth, where they become demons and monsters. The act almost causes the extinction of humanity; the middle son of Khormusta (&quot;Bukhe Belligte&quot; or &quot;Uile Butelegcji&quot;) was sent from the realm of heaven to undo the damage.

The Buryat version contains 9 branches or song episodes (&quot;uliger&quot;), each devoted to tell how Gesar defeats an enemy.
* First branch: Gesar&#x27;s youth. In this branch, Gesar, called Nyurgai (&quot;Stinker&quot;) and while still in his infancy, defeats three giant rats, human-sized mosquitos and steel ravens (compare Heracles and Cú Chulainn) and marries two princesses, whereupon he assumes his true name.
* Second branch: He marries princess &quot;Alma Mergen&quot;, daughter of a water deity. He then hunts demonic beasts, born from Atai Ulan&#x27;s drops of blood. These include a mountain-sized dragon, the keeper of a silver mountain.
* Third branch: He undertakes combat with the great Lord of the Taiga, the giant tiger Orgoli, which was born from Atai Ulan&#x27;s right hand.
* Fourth branch: He kills a great beast, &quot;Arkhan&quot; the Sun-Eater, who was born from Atai Ulan&#x27;s severed head.
* Fifth branch: He wars against &quot;Gal Dulme&quot;, the personification of volcanic activity, who was born from Atai Ulan&#x27;s corpse. Because of his youth Gesar is unable to defeat Gal Dulme by himself, and the deed is performed with assistance from his elder brother.
* Sixth branch: He wars against &quot;Abarga Sasen&quot;, a 15-headed demon born from Atai Ulan&#x27;s right leg.
* Seventh branch: He wars against &quot;Shiram Minata&quot;, a demon from the &#x27;Country betwixt Life and Death&#x27;, who was born from Atai Ulan&#x27;s left leg.
* Eighth branch: He wages war against three &quot;Shirai-Gol&quot; khans. This branch seems to be closely related to the Tibetan song about Gesar and three kings of the kingdom of Hor.
* Ninth branch: He campaigns against &quot;Lobsogoi&quot;, a trickster demon, who was born from Atai Ulan&#x27;s backside.

There are a number of stories not connected with the foregoing nine branches described above; for example, a story in which Gesar shames &quot;Gume-Khan&quot; of China, or one in which he exterminates the Four Recklings of Evil, demonic beings whose nature is not quite clear.

Distinctive features of these versions of the Gesar epic have led some scholars to the view that the Buryat and Mongolian versions are not directly dependent on a Tibetan original. Setsenmunkh has argued, and the idea was shared by C. Damdinsuren and B. Vladimirtsev, that the written Mongolian versions stem from one source which has not survived.

===Balti and Ladakhi version===
This version contains the following seven episodes:
* In Balti version of Kesar epic he is considered to be son of god(Lha Yokpoon) who was sent to Miyul(Earth) to restore peace and stability. 
* According to Balti oral transmission he was born in village Roung yul, Baltistan
* The ancestor Dong-gsum Mi-la sngon-mo, born miraculously, kills a nine-headed ogre, from whose body the land of Ling is born. He fathers eighteen heroes who arrive in gLing.
* dBang-po rgya-bzhin chooses his youngest son, Don-grub, to rule gLing. Dying, he is reborn as a bird, and then as Gog-bzang lha-mo, and is called Kesar/Kyesar.
* Kesar marries Lhamo Brugmo and becomes king of gLing.
* Kesar journeys to China, where he marries the emperor&#x27;s daughter, g.Yu&#x27;i dKon-mchog-ma.
* Kesar defeats the giants of the north, assisted by the giant&#x27;s wife, Dze-mo.
* While he is away, the King of Hor kidnaps his wife &#x27;Brug-gu-ma.
* On his return, Kesar vanquishes the King of Hor and brings his wife back to gLing.

===Similarities with motifs in Turkic heroic poetry===
Chadwick and Zhirmunsky consider that the main outlines of the cycle as we have it in Mongolia, Tibet and Ladakh show an outline that conforms to the pattern of heroic poetry among the Turkic peoples. (a) Like the Kirghiz hero Bolot, Gesar, as part of an initiation descends as a boy into the underworld. (b) The gateway to the underworld is through a rocky hole or cave on a mountain summit. (c) He is guided through the otherworld by a female tutelary spirit (&quot;Manene&quot;/grandmother) who rides an animal, like the Turkic shamaness &quot;kara Chach&quot;. (d) Like kara Chach, Gesar&#x27;s tutelary spirit helps him against a host of monstrous foes in the underworld. (e) Like Bolot, Gesar returns in triumph to the world, bearing the food of immortality and the water of life. (f) Like the Altai shamans, Gesar is borne heavenward on the back of a bird to obtain herbs to heal his people. They conclude that the stories of the Gesar cycle were well known in the territory of the Uyghur Khaganate.

===Oral transmission and performance===
According to Li Lianrong ():

Jiangbian pointed out that the foundation for the origin of epic is ethnic folk culture. He conjectured that before epics came into being, the Tibetan people &quot;already had a corpus of stories that described the formation of the heavens and the earth, their ethnic origin, and ethnic heroes; these stories provided a foundation for creating the character Gesar, also known as &quot;Sgrung&quot; in early history. After further polishing by the oral poets, especially the ballad singers, Gesar became a great epic&quot; (1986:51).
Many performers recite episodes from memory or books, while others chant the legendary tales in a state of trance. This last mode bears strong similarities with shamanic practitioners like the pawo mediums and &quot;mig mthong&quot; diviners.

As an heroic song composed or recited by oral bards, the epic of Gesar has been, for centuries, improvised on, and there is therefore no canonical or monumental version, as one finds in, for example, Greek epic. A given Gesar singer would know only his local version, which nonetheless would take weeks to recite. It has been responsive to regional culture and folklore, local conflicts, religious trends, and even political changes on the world stage. For example, in modern times, when news of World War II trickled into Tibet, additional episodes on how &quot;Gesar Conquers the Kingdom of Phyigling &#x27;Jar&quot; were composed by 8th Khamthrül Rinpoche (1929–1980), in which Gesar appears, according to some interpretations, to travel to Germany to vanquish the demon-king, perhaps alluding to Adolf Hitler.

===Religious dimension===
Tibetan history has often swung between centralized and stateless poles, and the epic of Gesar reflects the tensions between central authority, as embodied in religious orthodoxy, and the wild, nomadic forces of the autarkic periphery. There are versions that adopt Gesar as a lama showing him as a tamer of the wild, but, in so far as his epic retains his old lineaments as a maverick master of shamanic powers, he represents the stateless, anarchic dimension of Tibet&#x27;s margins, and is rather a tamer of corrupt monastic clerics and, thus, it is not coincidental that the epic flourished on the outlying regions of Kham and Amdo. His wars are campaigns of defence against hostile powers intent on subduing the kingdom of gLing, which are often construed as anti-Buddhist. But his vanquishing of the &quot;dzongs&quot; or fortresses preserves an ambiguity, since these were potential outposts of the state.

Until recently, the tale was forbidden reading in many Tibetan monasteries. In some monasteries, however, rituals invoking Gesar as a major spiritual force are performed. Given the central role the epic played over the centuries in Tibetan folk culture, Tibetan Buddhism has incorporated elements from it and interpreted them in religious terms. The Gelug school disapproved of the epic, while the Kagyu and Nyingma schools generally favoured it, seeing it as an expression of the activity of Padmasambhava and as a vehicle for Buddhist teachings, especially of the Dzogchen school. Consequentially, the question of whether &quot;babdrung&quot; (visionary Gesar bards) should be regarded as religious practitioners () will be answered differently by those who favor and those who oppose the epic; the &quot;babdrung&quot; themselves, however, generally emphasize the connection of the epic with the Dharma () and see themselves as a kind of religious practitioner.

Orgyen Tobgyal explained that in the Nyingma perspective, &quot;the real nature of the manifestation we know as Ling Gesar is actually that of Guru Rinpoche himself appearing in the form of a &quot;drala&quot;&quot; (Wylie: dgra bla, &quot;protective warrior spirit&quot;).

Chögyam Trungpa, who represented both Kagyu and Nyingma lineages and founded Shambhala Buddhism in the diaspora, inspired by the Greek philosophers of the polis, used the Gesar epic&#x27;s detailed tales about an idealized nomadic government formed by the Mukpo clan, which constructed a nomadic confederation of imperial reach, to develop a model of a Tibetan polity.

The government of China strongly supports the cult of Gesar and its practice among Han Chinese, according to some as a counter-force to Tibetan Buddhism.

In the region of Baltistan the King Kesar&#x27;s saga was told in homes, especially in winter, but now it is at the verge of distinction due to availability of the media devices. The region being inhabited by 100% Muslim population, the story was told only for recreational purposes and people would consider that the Kesar was not a human being but &quot;hla hlu&quot;, special creatures of God who are given special command and ability by God.

==History of Gesar studies==
The first printed edition of the Gesar epic was published in Beijing in 1716 in a Mongolian version. It was this text which formed the basis for the first Western-language translation, a Russian version published by the Moravian missionary Isaac Jacob Schmidt in 1836. A German translation followed in 1839. Another Moravian missionary, August Hermann Francke, collected and translated a version from Lower Ladakh between 1905 and 1909. In 1942 George Roerich made a comprehensive survey of the literature of Gesar (Roerich 1942; 277–315).

In the 20th century, other Mongolian Geser texts were edited by the social scientists Nicholas Poppe and Walther Heissig.

The first three volumes of the version known as the Lingtsang-Dege woodblock, which was composed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, were published with a very faithful though incomplete French translation by Rolf Stein in 1956. Stein followed this publication with his 600-page magnum opus on the Tibetan Epic entitled &quot;Recherches sur l&#x27;Epopee et le Barde au Tibet&quot;. This remains the most in-depth study of the Tibetan Gesar tradition. A literal translation of these same woodblocks into English was written by Kornman, Khandro, and Chonam and published by Shambhala in 2012 as The Epic of Gesar of Ling: Gesar&#x27;s Magical Birth, Early Years, and Coronation as King. A retelling of these volumes in a more accessible and contemporary voice was rendered by David Shapiro and published in 2019 as Gesar of Ling: A Bardic Tale from the Snow Land of Tibet.

The fourth volume of the epic, generally known as The Battle of Düd and Ling was translated by Jane Hawes, David Shapiro and Lama Chonam and published as The Taming of the Demons: From the Epic of Gesar in 2021 (Shambhala 2021).

Another version has been translated into German by Matthias Hermanns (1965). This translation is based on manuscripts collected by Hermanns in Amdo. This book also contains extensive study by Hermanns explaining the epic as the product of the Heroic Age of the nomads of North-eastern Tibet and their interactions with the many other peoples of the Inner Asian steppe. Hermanns believed the epic to pre-date Buddhism in Tibet, and saw in it an expression of the ancient Tibetan archetype of the &quot;heaven-sent king&quot;, as found also in the myths of the founders of the Yarlung Dynasty, who founded the Tibetan Empire (7th-9th centuries CE).

An accessible rendering of Gesar by Alexandra David-Néel in her &quot;Superhuman Life of Gesar of Ling&quot; was published in French in 1933.

===In occultism===
In the occult system of Nicholas Roerich, Gesar is presented as a hero who is believed to accept his physicality in Shambhala. It&#x27;s told that he would appear with an invincible army to set general justice. Thunderous arrows will be its weapon.
Gesar also has a number of magic attributes: white horse, saddle, horseshoe, sword and lock.

<text>Gulstan Ropert, SS.CC., (August 30, 1839 - January 4, 1903) of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary served as the third vicar apostolic of the Apostolic Vicariate of the Hawaiian Islands - now the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu, from 1892 to 1903.

== Early life ==
Born in France at Kerfago, St. Gildas de Rhuys, Morbihan, in Brittany, he was baptized as François. François Ropert entered the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary at age 20 and took the name Gulstan. He was ordained to the priesthood on May 26, 1866, at the age of 26.

He was sent to the Kingdom of Hawai‘i to assist the Vicariate, arriving in Honolulu on June 9, 1868. In 1873, he was one of three priests to volunteer to serve in Molokai; the others were Boniface Shäffer, Rupert Lauter, and Damien De Veuster, the last of whom was selected.

Ropert was in charge of the Hamakua district on the island of Hawai‘i until October 2, 1883, when he was assigned to the Wailuku mission. He left Wailuku for Honolulu in 1891 having been appointed Vice-Provincial.

==Elevation to the episcopate==

After Msgr. Koeckemann&#x27;s death on February 22, 1892, Father Ropert earnestly begged his superiors not to be nominated as Vicar Apostolic. Superior General Father Bosquet ignored Father Ropert&#x27;s request and appointed him as Provincial on April 22, 1892, and recommended that he be a candidate for the office of Vicar Apostolic left vacant by the death of Msgr. Koeckemann. Having received the bull of his nomination to lead the Hawaiian Islands on June 3, 1892, Father Ropert embarked for San Francisco where he was consecrated in Saint Mary&#x27;s Cathedral as a bishop of the titular see of Panopolis on September 25 at the age of 53 by Archbishop Patrick William Riordan, assisted by Bishop Lawrence Scanlan of Salt Lake City and Bishop Francisco Mora y Borrell of Monterey-Los Angeles. Msgr. Ropert adopted an episcopal coat of arms of azure, containing a Saint Anna of Auray, accompanied by the letters A.M. (standing for &quot;Ave Maria&quot;) in silver with his motto being &quot;Tuus sum ego, salvum me fac&quot; (from Psalm 118: 94, meaning, &quot;I am yours, save me&quot;). During his episcopate, Msgr. Ropert witnessed the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1893 and the continuing migration of workers for the Hawaiian sugar industry. He built a new residence for the clergy in Honolulu, a wooden two-story building, flanked on all sides, except the rear, by a veranda. Subsequently. the old adobe house was torn down and on its site was placed a statue of &quot;Nôtre Dame de la Paix&quot; (Our Lady of Peace), which he blessed on December 24, 1893, the sixty-second anniversary of the first expulsion from the Hawaiian Islands of the first prefect apostolic, Msgr. Alexis Bachelot.

==Secret societies and establishment of Catholic Young Men&#x27;s Institute==

Msgr. Ropert&#x27;s peace-loving nature made him hesitate in enforcing in his vicariate the condemnation by the Holy Office of the secret societies of the Odd Fellows, the Knights of Pythias, and the Sons of Temperance on June 24, 1894. The documents of the Holy See were addressed to the Catholic Bishops of the United States and his wish not to disturb the Catholics of his jurisdiction who were members of the condemned organizations inclined him to the opinion (confirmed by Archbishop Riordan of San Francisco) that the proscription was limited to the United States. On the advice of the Superior General of the Picpus Fathers, Msgr. Ropert later published the Roman decree and extended the Holy See&#x27;s condemnation of the secret societies to include the Hawaiian Islands. To better counteract membership in these societies, Msgr. Ropert supported the establishment of three councils of the Young Men&#x27;s Institute.

==Brother Infirmarians at the Kalaupapa Settlement==

Prior to his first &quot;ad limina&quot; visit to Rome in 1895, Msgr. Ropert appointed Father Cornelius Limburg as his pro-Vicar. He then left for France in the company of Father Hubert Stappers and a Portuguese youth, Peter Alencastre (later Bishop Stephen Alencastre) who was to begin his studies for the priesthood at Louvain in Belgium. During his voyage, Msgr. Ropert showed his devotion to the priests of his jurisdiction by paying a visit to each one&#x27;s family - which caused him to journey through France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. He returned to Honolulu on November 16, 1895 accompanied by Father Pamphile deVeuster, the brother of the late Father Damien, one choir brother and four lay brothers, all destined for the Kalaupapa Settlement. According to arrangements made with the Board of Health, the brothers were given the care of the Bishop&#x27;s Home for Boys in Kalaupapa. Father Pamphile followed in his brother&#x27;s footsteps, but being an elderly, scholarly man at the time of his arrival, he could not get accustomed to the surroundings and returned to Belgium on August 25, 1897.

==Catholic education in the vicariate==

Msgr. Ropert&#x27;s continuing concern for Catholic education of his flock led him to erect a girls&#x27; school in Hilo entrusted to the Franciscan sisters; in Honolulu he also established a free school for boys (St. Francis School) in connection with St. Louis College (September 1893). He also provided a new concrete schoolhouse for the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts (1901). During Msgr. Ropert&#x27;s episcopate, the Treaty of Paris in 1898 effectively ended the Spanish–American War, with the loss of the Philippines, Guam and Puerto Rico to the United States. This seminal event would lay the groundwork for the migration of workers for the sugar industry in Hawai‘i from the vestiges of the Spanish empire in the predominantly Roman Catholic Philippines, Puerto Rico and Guam.

==Father Wendelin Moeller and the Board of Health==

On December 4, 1901, Pilipo Mikila and Kalani, left the Kalaupapa Hansen&#x27;s Disease Settlement in violation of the regulations of the Board of Health. The local police captain, believing that they had been stealing sheep, arrested them on their return to Kalaupapa and put them in jail. Kalani made a confession and was put in a light airy cell. Mikila denied guilt and as a punishment, was put in a cell with no outside window, comparatively dark and poorly ventilated. Until March 12, 1902, he was not arraigned on any charge and no written accusation was made against him. He was in an advanced state of Hansen&#x27;s disease when arrested and grew even worse during his detainment. On the aforementioned date, he was taken home by the members of a society to which he belonged. He died six days later. He had no proper care before leaving the jail, and no medical attention. Complaints were made about this heartless and illegal treatment to the attorney-general and after an investigation, C. W. Reynolds, the superintendent of the settlement, and Dr. Oliver, the local physician were discharged for official neglect. It was a surprise to the public that at the same meeting of the Board of Health where these actions were taken, it was similarly resolved that &quot;the harmony and interests of the leper settlement would be promoted by the removal of Father Wendelin Moeller (the priest in charge of Kalaupapa since Father Damien&#x27;s death) and that the Right Reverend Gulstan, Bishop of Panopolis, be requested to remove him forthwith and appoint some other priest to fill the vacancy made thereby.&quot; Msgr. Ropert subsequently informed the Board he would comply with their resolution when formal written charges against Father Wendelin had been served and proven. The Board refused to file charges, but informed the Msgr. Ropert that Father Wendelin&#x27;s permit to remain at the settlement would be revoked as of June 10, 1902. It was later disclosed that Superintendent Reynolds had filed complaints with the Board accusing Father Wendelin of interfering with his management; Father Wendelin admitted having preached, not against the Board of Health, but against the shameful immorality of concubinage and adultery at the settlement, and the performance of public work to be done on Sunday without any urgent necessity. After considerable public outrage at the actions of the Board of Health by the Home Rule Party, the various Catholic societies, the Portuguese societies, the Protestant Ministerial Union, the Board of Health resolved &quot;out of respect for the Bishop and in appreciation of the charitable objects of the Catholic mission at the settlement, this request (by Msgr. Ropert to retain Father Wendelin in view of his long and faithful services at the Kalaupapa Settlement) be granted on the distinct understanding that Father Wendelin attend strictly to his clerical duties in the future...&quot; Father Wendelin, appreciative of Msgr. Ropert&#x27;s efforts opined that he could not &quot;strictly adhere to his clerical duties&quot; without preaching against immorality and the breaking of the Sabbath, and requested that Msgr. Ropert relieve him of his charge. On September 23, 1902, Msgr. Ropert granted Father Wendelin&#x27;s request and replaced him with Father Maximin André, head of the Hilo mission.

==Final years==
Msgr. Ropert engaged in extensive pastoral visitation notwithstanding the pain caused by a stomach cancer he endured since September 1898. In summer of 1902, he made a trip to San Francisco and lower California partly for business and partly for the benefit of his declining health. He returned, no better, and succumbed to his illness on January 4, 1903. He was buried in the Honolulu Catholic Cemetery at 839A South King Street, in downtown Honolulu.

<doc id="750978" wikidata="Q265148" url="?curid=750978" title="Machiko Hasegawa">
<text>was a Japanese manga artist and one of the first female manga artists. She started her own comic strip, &quot;Sazae-san&quot;, in 1946. It reached national circulation via the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; in 1949, and ran daily until Hasegawa decided to retire in February 1974. All of her comics were printed in Japan in digest comics; by the mid-1990s, Hasegawa&#x27;s estate had sold over 60 million copies in Japan alone.

== Life and career ==
Machiko Hasegawa was born January 30, 1920, in Taku, Saga Prefecture. When she was 15, her father died and the family moved to Tokyo, where she took up drawing cartoons. She successfully published several in magazines and newspapers, such as , , , and a few that only ran for a short while. Her comics were the first to follow a consistent four-panel layout, which later became the standard.

Hasegawa never married, instead living with her older sister Mariko. Both were art collectors, and their collection is housed in the Hasegawa Machiko Art Museum. The two started the Shimaisha Publishing Company, through which 20 million paperback copies of her comics have been published. Hasegawa died of heart failure on May 27, 1992, at the age of 72. Towards the end of her life she stopped appearing in public and on television, and her death was kept a secret for 35 days after her private funeral as requested in her will.

==&quot;Sazae-san&quot;==

&quot;Sazae-san&quot; was a popular postwar comic strip depicting the life of Sazae-san, a fictional Japanese housewife.

The comic strip was turned into a dramatic radio series in 1955 and a weekly animated series in 1969, which is still running as of 2024.

Hasegawa was involved in a court case with a bus company&#x27;s unapproved use of &quot;Sazae-san&quot; and its characters in promotional images, as well as the name of the business, &quot;Sazae-san Tours&quot;. As a result of this case, new copyright laws were established that extended protection for fictional characters as individual identities, not just within their series of origin.

Selected comics were translated into English, under the title &quot;The Wonderful World of Sazae-san&quot;. 

==Awards==
Hasegawa won the 8th Bungeishunjū Manga Award for &quot;Sazae-san&quot; in 1962. She was the first female manga artist to receive Japan&#x27;s Medal of Honor with Purple Ribbon in 1982. She also received the 4th Tokyo Cultural Award in 1988; the Order of the Precious Crown, Fourth Class in 1990; the Minister of Education Award for &quot;Sazae-san&quot; at the 20th Japan Cartoonists Association Awards in 1991; the 10th People&#x27;s Honor Award in 1992; and the Special Prize at the 24th Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prizes in 2020.

<text>Herman Koeckemann, formally Bernard Hermann Koeckemann, SS.CC., (January 10, 1828 – February 22, 1892), served as the second vicar apostolic of the Vicariate Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands — now the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu — from 1881 to 1892.

== Biography ==
Born in Ostbevern, Westphalia, Germany, he was baptized as Bernard. At the age of 14, his father, a farmer, sent him to the Gymnasium of Münster. Koeckemann was an excellent student and excelled in classical studies. During his seven years of college, his progress in Latin, Greek, Hebrew and French and in philosophy and science was so well marked that at the graduation, his examiners dispensed with the oral examination as superfluous.

Believing himself called to religious life, he went to Leuven and entered the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. After a novitiate of eighteen months, he was admitted to religious profession on April 11, 1851, taking the name Herman. After three years of theologate, he was sent by his superiors to the Kingdom of Hawaii for work as a missionary. He arrived in Honolulu on November 13, 1854, and was subsequently ordained to the priesthood as a member of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary on May 31, 1862, at the age of 34.

Koeckemann served as pastor to the fledgling Catholic community of native Hawaiians. When Msgr. Louis Maigret fell ill, Father Koeckemann was appointed coadjutor vicar apostolic to fulfill some of the bishop&#x27;s regular duties. On August 21, 1881, Father Koeckemann was ordained at Saint Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in San Francisco, California, as a bishop of the titular see of Olba at the age of 53, with a papal mandate to serve as coadjutor Vicar Apostolic with right of succession.

Upon Msgr. Maigret&#x27;s death, Msgr. Koeckemann succeeded as vicar apostolic on June 11, 1882. During his episcopate, the massive migration of Portuguese workers for the sugarcane plantations from Madeira Islands and the Azores began. With the subsequent increase in population from these migrations, Msgr. Koeckemann made Catholic education a priority of the Vicariate and built many schools with the Marianist brothers. 

He died in Honolulu in 1892 and was buried at the Honolulu Catholic Cemetery in downtown Honolulu.

==Order of Kalākaua==
King David Kalākaua bestowed on Herman the honor &quot;Knight Commander of the Royal Order of Kalākaua&quot; in 1881.

<doc id="750982" wikidata="Q7866945" url="?curid=750982" title="USS A. G. Prentiss">
<text>A. G. Prentiss (Id. No. 2413) was the wooden-hulled commercial vessel &quot;A. G. Prentiss&quot; launched 6 February 1912, by the Charles Ward Shipyard in Kennebunk, Maine, registered with official number 209585, for passenger service with home port at Saco, Maine. The vessel was named for Alfred G. Prentiss, owner of other tugs and a grain and groceries business. Despite the odd registration as &quot;passenger&quot; service when &quot;tow&quot; is one of the options, the vessel was well documented as a tug boat operating on the Saco River in Maine.

==Service history==
The United States Navy inspected her in the 3rd Naval District on 6 March 1918, and selected her for service. &quot;A. G. Prentiss&quot; was delivered to the Navy on 25 March 1918, under a charter approved three days later. Navy references do not indicate commissioning and thus the ship did not bear the United States Ship (U.S.S.) honorific.

&quot;A. G. Prentiss&quot; apparently served in the 3rd Naval District for her entire career, as she is listed as having that area as her duty station in the 1918 Ship&#x27;s Data volume. However, there are no extant deck logs to confirm this inference. Records indicate that &quot;A. G. Prentiss&quot; was returned to her owner on 2 December 1918, and her name stricken from the Navy list the same day.

In the 1919 register the vessel is shown as a tow boat with New York, N.Y. as port of registry. Later registers show the tug owned by the Saco River Towing Company with home port of Portland, Maine. The last register in which the tug appears under &quot;Steam Vessels&quot; with a descriptive line is the 1935–1936 volume. From that point on the name and official number only appear under an index of managing owners.

On 15 April 1923 the steamer &quot;Annahuac&quot; ran onto Fortune&#x27;s Rocks and was salvaged by tugs &quot;A. G. Prentiss&quot;, &quot;Cumberland&quot; and the revenue cutter &quot;Ossipee&quot;. The salvage fee was disputed, but the tugs were awarded $9,000 each. The tug was reportedly active into World War II, reportedly towing targets for a coastal battery, and also being wrecked and burned.

As late as 1961, a vessel with official number 209585 named &quot;A. G. Prentiss&quot; appears in &quot;Merchant Vessels of the United States&quot; only under &quot;Index of Managing Owners&quot; with managing owner being Peerless #One Corp., (N.J.), 36 New Street, East Boston, Massachusetts. The vessel does not otherwise appear in the registry. She was converted from steam to diesel (An 1879 Buda) and was owned by Esterhill in East Boston, then sold to Boston Fuel on 36 New Street in East Boston in the early 1950s (Related to Esterhill)

<text>Louis-Désiré Maigret, SS.CC. (September 14, 1804 – June 11, 1882), served as the first vicar apostolic of the Vicariate Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands, now the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu. Born in Saint-Pierre-de-Maillé, France, Maigret was ordained to the priesthood as a member of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary on September 23, 1828, at the age of 24. As part of his missionary work, Father Maigret sailed to the Kingdom of Hawaii to help build its Catholic community of native Hawaiians.
The diocese sent him as a missionary to Pohnpei, now in Micronesia, in December 1837 on the schooner &quot;Notre Dame de Paix&quot;. He was the first missionary ever seen there. In his company were &quot;several Mangarevans and Tahitians,&quot; some of whom remained on Pohnpei and left descendants. He departed on 29 July 1838 for Valparaiso after seven unsuccessful months.

When the Vicar Apostolic of Oriental Oceania, Msgr. Étienne Rouchouze, SS.CC., was lost at sea on board the ill-fated &quot;Marie Joseph&quot; in early 1843, the Holy See appointed Father Maigret as the first vicar apostolic of the Sandwich Islands on September 11, 1846, at the age of 42. He was officially ordained as a bishop of the titular see of Arathia (Arad) on November 28, 1847, at the age of 43. Bishop Maigret oversaw the construction of what would become his most lasting legacy, the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace.

Maigret ordained Father Damien de Veuster in Honolulu cathedral in May 1864. He supported Damien in his work with lepers.

After his death, Maigret was entombed in the crypt below the sanctuary.

<text>Behaviour (released as Behavior in the United States) is the fourth studio album by the English synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys, released on 22 October 1990 by Parlophone. A Japanese special edition included a bonus mini CD, exclusive artwork and printed lyrics in a white velvet-like box.

==Background==
Harold Faltermeyer produced &quot;Behaviour&quot; at his Red Deer studio in Munich, Germany (West Germany at the time of recording). Because they were dissatisfied with the available digital synthesisers and samples, Pet Shop Boys wanted to use analogue synthesisers. Faltermeyer was chosen as a producer as he happened to be an expert on analogue equipment. The result was a Pet Shop Boys album that differed from both the previous album, &quot;Introspective&quot;, and the 1993 follow-up, &quot;Very&quot;. In places, the album expands upon the synth-pop genre with flavours of guitar pop ballads, as with &quot;This Must Be the Place I Waited Years to Leave&quot; and &quot;My October Symphony&quot; (a song about the decline of the Soviet Union) with the guitarist Johnny Marr; Marr and Neil Tennant previously worked together on the 1989 Electronic song &quot;Getting Away with It&quot;. Later, singer Tennant reflected on the different style of &quot;Behaviour&quot;: &quot;It was more reflective and more musical-sounding, and also it probably didn&#x27;t have irritatingly crass ideas in it, like our songs often do.&quot; He said that the album was inspired by the fellow synth-pop group Depeche Mode&#x27;s album &quot;Violator&quot;, released the same year.

In a 1993 interview with &quot;NME&quot;, Chris Lowe recalled of &quot;Behaviour&quot;, &quot;The funny thing was that album was written at a time when the whole rave scene was fantastically exciting and good, the music was really up. I can&#x27;t understand what happened; we set out to write an uplifting album and we ended up with something which was the complete opposite.&quot; Tennant added, &quot;There was an element of sadness to it, it&#x27;s one of these things that sad songs are more interesting to write.&quot;

==Singles==
* &quot;So Hard&quot; (R 6269 – 24 September 1990)
The video was directed by Eric Watson. The B-side was &quot;It Must Be Obvious&quot;, with the USA release also having the Italian Mix of &quot;Paninaro&quot;, which was originally released on &quot;Disco&quot;. Remixes were by the Pet Shop Boys themselves, The KLF and David Morales. The KLF also remixed &quot;It Must Be Obvious&quot;, which was only available on &quot;The KLF versus Pet Shop Boys&quot; CD and 12-inch of the single.
* &quot;Being Boring&quot; (R 6275 – 12 November 1990)
The video was directed by Bruce Weber. The B-side was &quot;We All Feel Better in the Dark&quot;. There were Pet Shop Boys Extended Mixes of both A-side and B-side, and there was a remix of &quot;Being Boring&quot; by Marshall Jefferson and two remixes of the B-side by Brothers in Rhythm on a limited edition 12-inch and CD of the single.
* &quot;How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?&quot; (E2-56205 – 1991)
The video was directed by Liam Kan. The single was radically remixed from the album version by Brothers in Rhythm, and this become the version on the double A-side released in the UK with &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name (I Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You)&quot;. This US release had the Techno Funk mix of &quot;I Want a Dog&quot;, the Marshall Jefferson remix of &quot;Being Boring&quot; and the Trevor Horn 7-inch mix of &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot;. There were also remixes by David Morales, which were released on a limited edition 12-inch and CD. The single mix was not on any of the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; greatest hits or singles compilations (&quot;Discography: The Complete Singles Collection&quot;, &quot;Pop Art: Pet Shop Boys – The Hits&quot; and &quot;Smash: The Singles 1985-2020&quot;), although the video was on the &quot;Pop Art&quot; DVD, &quot;Videography&quot; and the &quot;Smash&quot; Blu-ray.
* &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name (I Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You)&quot; / &quot;How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?&quot; (R 6285 – 11 March 1991)
The videos for both songs were directed by Liam Kan, which drew on iconography from the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; then current tour with Tennant spoofing several &#x27;rock&#x27; stars including U2, Bruce Springsteen, Elvis Presley and George Michael. There was an additional B-side, &quot;Bet She&#x27;s Not Your Girlfriend&quot;, and, in addition to some extended mixes of both singles, there were additional remixes of both songs by David Morales.
* &quot;Jealousy&quot; (R 6283 – 28 May 1991)
The video was directed by Eric Watson. The B-side was the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; tidied-up demo version of &quot;Losing My Mind&quot;, which they produced for Liza Minnelli in 1989 for her album &quot;Results&quot;. The single mix was more electronic than the album version and there was an extended mix of &quot;Jealousy&quot; with Tennant reading excerpts of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;, which is a play about jealousy. There was also a Disco Mix of &quot;Losing My Mind&quot;. On the limited edition CD, an edit of the Extended Mix of &quot;This Must Be the Place I Waited Years to Leave&quot; (which was originally available with the Japanese version of &quot;Behaviour&quot;) was included along with David Morales&#x27; Red Zone mix of &quot;So Hard&quot;. &quot;Jealousy&quot; was later covered by Dubstar. It is known to be one of Robbie Williams&#x27; favourite Pet Shop Boys songs, and he sang it with the duo for their 2006 Radio 2 concert, which was later released on the 2006 Pet Shop Boys&#x27; live album &quot;Concrete&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Behaviour&quot; was met with very good reviews in 1990 and has since gained excellent reviews in retrospective. Reviewing &quot;Behaviour&quot; for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Jim Farber commented that the album contained the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; &quot;best tunes yet&quot; and &quot;their most consistently beautiful melodies to date&quot;, noting &quot;an easier way with the beats and greater vulnerability in the lyrics&quot; compared to the duo&#x27;s earlier material. Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that &quot;Behaviour&quot; &quot;may strike some listeners as even wimpier and blander than earlier releases, but its subtle brilliance emerges with repeated plays&quot;, calling it &quot;a record that&#x27;ll seduce dance clubs for a few months, and haunt the stay-at-home crowd for long after&quot;. &quot;Some of their dance fans may be a trifle disappointed,&quot; wrote Mark Cooper for &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;but the best ballads here are as wry and touching as vintage Broadway. Frank Sinatra should be calling shortly.&quot; The magazine named &quot;Behaviour&quot; one of the 50 best albums of 1990. Robert Christgau selected &quot;Being Boring&quot; and &quot;My October Symphony&quot; as highlights in his &quot;Village Voice&quot; &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; column; he later gave the album a &quot;two-star honorable mention&quot; grade, indicating a &quot;likable effort that consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well enjoy&quot;.

In a mixed review, &quot;NME&quot;″s Roger Morton conceded that &quot;Behaviour&quot; &quot;is probably no more a disconsolate record than &quot;Introspective&quot; or &quot;Actually&quot;&quot;, but questioned its relative lack of &quot;a defiant surge of rhythm&quot;. Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; found that the album reaches &quot;the emotional peaks&quot; of the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; previous work on &quot;peppy highlights&quot; such as &quot;So Hard&quot; and &quot;The End of the World&quot;, while &quot;the occasional lapses and the forays into slower tempos&quot; feel &quot;flat by comparison&quot;.

In 1999, &quot;Q&quot; listed &quot;Behaviour&quot; as one of the 90 best albums of the 1990s, while the critic Ned Raggett ranked it ninth on his list of &quot;The Top 136 or So Albums of the Nineties&quot; for &quot;Freaky Trigger&quot;. &quot;Behaviour&quot; is included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Re-release==
Along with the rest of the group&#x27;s first six studio albums, &quot;Behaviour&quot; was re-released as &quot;Behaviour/Further Listening: 1990–1991&quot; in 2001. The reissue was digitally remastered and accompanied with a second disc of B-sides, and some previously unreleased songs, recorded from 1990 to 1991. Notable songs on the second disc include &quot;Miserablism&quot;, &quot;DJ Culture&quot;, &quot;Was It Worth It?&quot; and the Ambient Mix of &quot;Music for Boys&quot;. &quot;Miserablism&quot;, a poignant satire of Morrissey, was intended for inclusion on &quot;Behaviour&quot; until the day it was sent for mastering. It later became the B-side to &quot;Was It Worth It?&quot; and was remixed by Moby for the 12-inch single; it was also on the limited edition version of the duo&#x27;s 2003 compilation album &quot;&quot;, in a remixed form. &quot;DJ Culture&quot; and &quot;Was It Worth It?&quot; were the two singles recorded for the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; 1991 compilation album, &quot;&quot;. &quot;Music for Boys&quot; was originally credited as &quot;Music for Boys Part 2&quot; and was the B-side to &quot;DJ Culture&quot;. The original B-side version can also be found on the 1995 compilation album &quot;Alternative&quot;. This reissue was re-released in 2018 along with the Further Listening editions of &quot;Very&quot; and &quot;Bilingual&quot;.

Another re-release followed on 9 February 2009, under the title of &quot;Behaviour: Remastered&quot;. This version contains only the 10 tracks on the original.

<text>A snood () is a type of traditionally female headgear, with two types known. The long-gone Scottish snood was a circlet made of ribbon worn by Scottish young women as a symbol of chastity. In the 1590s, snoods were made using Florentine silk ribbon for the gentlewomen at the court of Anne of Denmark by Elizabeth Gibb.

The other type was intended to hold the hair in a cloth or net-like hat. In the most common form, the headgear resembles a close-fitting hood worn over the back of the head. It is similar to a hairnet, but snoods typically have a looser fit. 

Decorative hairnets, popular among women in the Victorian era, were referred to as snoods. This term was then applied to any netlike hat, and, in the 1930s, to a net bag headgear. This latter meaning became popular during the Second World War when women joined the workforce &quot;en masse&quot; and were required to wear the headgear to avoid their hair getting caught by the moving parts of the factory machinery.

For a short time during WWII, the snoods were at the height of fashion (a hit of Paris collections in 1939).

==Beard snood==
Another similar garment which is also referred to as a snood is used to cover facial hair such as beards and moustaches when working in environments such as food production. Although it appears that &quot;hairnet&quot; has replaced &quot;snood&quot; as the common term for hair containment on the head, the term &quot;beard snood&quot; (essentially a &quot;ringed scarf&quot;) is still familiar in many food production facilities.

==Religious use==
Women&#x27;s snoods are often worn by married Orthodox Jewish women, according to the religious requirement of hair covering (see Tzniut). Since these snoods are designed to cover the hair more than hold it, they are often lined to prevent them from being see-through. Contemporary hair snoods for Jewish women come in a wide range of colors and designs.

In the 21st century, the women use snoods primarily for religious reasons.

<text>Bill Oddie Goes Wild was a British television series about natural history, presented by Bill Oddie. Three series were made. It was the successor to Bill Oddie&#x27;s previous ornithological programme, &quot;Birding with Bill Oddie&quot;, which ended at the end of March 2000 after three series.

==Series 1==
This was a six-part series broadcast on Fridays in the UK on BBC Two at 7:30 pm from 5 January 2001. Presented by Bill Oddie the programme showed him as he visited six locations around Britain in search of a variety of wildlife – including birds, but also featuring sharks, snakes, dragonflies, badgers, bees, deer, squirrels and many more. The series was supposed to start in September 2000, but was delayed due to the Fuel protests in the United Kingdom until early 2001.

As with the previous series, &quot;Birding with Bill Oddie&quot;, the programmes were only loosely scripted, and a lot of Oddie&#x27;s dialogues were spontaneous and improvised.

===Cornwall in Late Summer===
5 January

Species seen: shore crab, pipefish, dormice, badgers, little egrets, butterflies (gatekeeper, red admirals, marbled white, skipper), moths (rosy footman, swallowtailed, scarce silver-lines) and seals.

The first episode features photography of badgers at dusk, which captivated Oddie: &quot;One of the wildest animals I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. Although the intention of the series was to look more at wildlife other than birds, it&#x27;s obvious that they couldn&#x27;t stop Oddie doing some birding (from the pub car park). For Oddie to get views of the seals, he has to lie on his back in the water. Whilst this does attract the seals, there are all behind him so unfortunately he can&#x27;t see anything. To add to the humiliation, one of them chews a chunk out of the seat of his wetsuit. Oddie later admitted that his wetsuit was inflated as he has a fear of water.

Clovelly Charter boats were used in this episode for Oddie to get views of the seals.

===Lake District in Autumn===
12 January

Species seen: red squirrel, mushrooms (razorstrop, Jew&#x27;s ear, puff ball (also known as the devils snuff box), fly agaric and dead man&#x27;s fingers), bearded tits, red deer, medicinal leech, white-clawed crayfish, bats (Daubenton&#x27;s bat, noctule) and whooper swans.

How does a red squirrel feeder work? As we find out in this episode – weight! The grey squirrel, being larger and heavier, falls out a special trap door in the feeder (&quot;Should&#x27;ve stayed on the diet shouldn&#x27;t you!&quot; mocks Oddie). The red squirrel, being more nimble, can walk straight in and get the food. One scene in this episode has to be Oddie trying to attract medicinal leeches. Standing in waders at the shore of lake, &quot;clomping around in a bovine manner&quot;! Apparently, he was trying to &quot;simulate not stimulate!&quot; a cow. Once again, Oddie is given the chance to do a bit of birding, watching whooper swans at WWT Martin Mere:
I was just on my way home, and I couldn&#x27;t resist stopping to look!

===Speyside in Spring===
19 January

Species seen: mountain hare, rock ptarmigan, common chaffinch, brambling, siskin, great tit, coal tit, crested tit, male capercaillie, wolves, wild cat, pine marten, black grouse, red ant and Eurasian otter.

Despite being filmed in mid-April, Oddie is walking on a mountain in thick mist and snow. Dr Adam Watson who showed us dotterel in the first series of Birding with Bill Oddie, is back to take Oddie to see mountain hare and ptarmigan. Oddie was always saying how the one bird he hasn&#x27;t yet seen is a male capercaillie, his &#x27;bogey bird&#x27;. This time he does get to see one, although it was only on a TV screen &#x27;live from the lek&#x27;. When they filmed the shots of the otter, the crew had all retired to a little café in the village and ordered their fish and chips. When the owner of the café came and told them that there was an otter that frequented the shore there – they were far more interested in getting their fish and chips until the woman said, &quot;Oh yes, he sometimes comes right up onto the beach – oh, there he is now...&quot; and the crew and Oddie were out of the door before she&#x27;d finished the sentence. They&#x27;d filmed all sorts of stuff in Scotland and were looking for an ending to the show, and used the otter scene.

===Merseyside in Early Spring===
26 January

Species seen: plants (ferns, &quot;Buddleia&quot;, Oxford ragwort), ravens, mussels, prawns, intestinal seaweed (or &#x27;gutweed&#x27;), shrimps, shore crab, breadcrumb sponge, Korean sea squirts, peregrine falcons, urban fox, sand martins, great crested grebes, black-necked grebes

This episode provided insight into how close wildlife can be to cities and motorways. Black necked grebes at Woolston Eyes nature reserve, right next to the M6 motorway, peregrine falcons nesting on buildings in Birkenhead, and sponges and Korean sea squirts in the docklands (no sign of Richard or Judy). The ash cliffs created by Fiddler&#x27;s Ferry power station are home to sand martins, and old clay pits support great crested grebes. Oddie explains how Oxford ragwort has made its way to a wall in Liverpool from Mount Etna (via the Oxford Botanical Gardens). When he saw &#x27;evidence&#x27; of ravens on one of Liverpool Cathedral&#x27;s statues, he joked, with a nod to &quot;The Fast Show&quot;, &quot;This week I be mosely wearin&#x27; Raven poo&quot;. Due to its location this episode gave the excuse to play the Beatles and the Kinks, rather than the usual soundtrack.

===Dorset in Late Spring===
2 February

Species seen: lizards (common, sand, slowworm), nightjar, damselflies, dragonflies (four-spotted chaser), red squirrel, sundew plant, smooth snake, Japanese sika deer

What seems to make this series so fresh is that Oddie seems to learning along the way. What he first thinks is a sand lizard, turns out to be a common, but he&#x27;s not afraid to admit it. This episode&#x27;s &quot;what daft thing can we get Oddie to do&quot; was waving white tissues at dusk to attract nightjars. &quot;For heavens sake can&#x27;t they see its just a big fat birdwatcher waving a couple of tissues, but apparently not!&quot;. The scene finished with Oddie morris dancing with his nightjar bait. They&#x27;d been here before looking nightjars for series 2 of Birding with Bill Oddie, but they found none. This time it worked, and Oddie got to see his nightjar. When Oddie gets to view a red squirrel from the comfort of a house on Brownsea Island he claims &quot;It&#x27;s a bit easy, isn&#x27;t it? I must go out and do something really difficult later&quot;. He also introduces us to the sundew, a carnivorous plant, with taste for insects. Nectar- tipped barbs are attractive to their prey, but are sticky and hold them fast. Oddie can&#x27;t resist setting a damselfly free from one though.

===Northumberland and the Farnes in early Summer===
9 February

Species seen: flowers (viper&#x27;s bugloss, birds-foot trefoil, restharrow, hedge woundwort, marsh cinquefoil), toads, sandhoppers, water vole, puffins, Arctic terns, kittiwakes, shags and guillemots.

For the last in the series, Oddie visited the &quot;last county before Scotland&quot;, which held memories for him as he walks past the house that used to be Monks House Bird Observatory (you can read about his experiences there in &quot;Bill Oddie&#x27;s gone Birding&quot;). It was while staying here that Oddie discovered Hauxley Nature Reserve, where the owner of the Observatory showed him a variety of plantlife. Plants such as viper&#x27;s bugloss, which has been used to cure snake bites, and restharrow, named because of its habit of seizing up the plough&#x27;s harrow. Behind a supermarket, in amongst a debris of shopping trolleys and rubbish, Oddie finds a tiny water vole. A trip to the Farne Islands brings Oddie close to an Arctic tern colony as they divebomb him and peck at his baseball cap and camera lens. One even perches on his arm, and it is this footage gets used in the opening credits. Oddie attempts to &#x27;sing&#x27; at the seals with a rather sad wailing call, and surprisingly, it works.

==Series 2==
There were eight episodes in series 2.

===Scilly Isles===
Friday 4 January.
The first show sees Oddie in the discovering tropical flowers, bizarre creatures that glow in the dark, exotic birds and stick insects. He also has another go at swimming with seals.

<doc id="751030" wikidata="Q1140442" url="?curid=751030" title="Sazae-san">
<text>is a Japanese &quot;yonkoma&quot; manga series written and illustrated by Machiko Hasegawa. It was first published in Hasegawa&#x27;s local paper, the , on April 22, 1946. When the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; wished to have Hasegawa draw the four-panel comic for their paper, she moved to Tokyo in 1949 with the explanation that the main characters had moved from Kyūshū to Tokyo as well. The first &quot;Sazae-san&quot; strip run by the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; was published on November 30, 1949. The manga dealt with everyday life and contemporary situations in Tokyo until Hasegawa retired and ended the series, with the final comic published on February 21, 1974.

As of 1999, the manga had over 86 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. An anime television adaptation by TCJ (later renamed Eiken) began airing in Japan in October 1969 and holds the Guinness World Record for the longest-running animated television series. It has also been adapted into a radio show, theatrical plays and songs.

==Plot==
In the beginning, Sazae was more interested in being with her horse than dressing up in a kimono and makeup to attract her future husband. Hasegawa was forward-thinking in that, in her words, the Isono/Fuguta clan would embody the image of the modern Japanese family after World War II.

Sazae was a very liberated woman, and many of the early plotlines revolved around Sazae bossing around her husband, to the consternation of her neighbors, who believed that a man should be the head of his household. Later, Sazae became a feminist and was involved in many comical situations regarding her affiliation with her local women&#x27;s lib group.

Despite the topical nature of the series, the core of the stories revolved around the large family dynamic, and were presented in a lighthearted, easy fashion. In fact, the final comic, in 1974, revolved around Sazae&#x27;s happiness that an egg she cracked for her husband&#x27;s breakfast produced a double yolk, with Katsuo remarking about the happiness the &quot;little things&quot; in life can bring.

In current culture, the popular &quot;Sazae-san&quot; anime is frequently viewed as a nostalgic representation of traditional Japanese society, since it represents a simpler time before many of the changes brought by modern technology. Its social themes, though very liberal at the time of its publication, are evocative of a bygone and nostalgic era.

==Media==
===Manga===
The comic strip was published in book form by from 1946 to 1974, which Machiko ran with her sister, Mariko. In April 1993, this publishing company went out of business and the comic books went out of print. The same year, &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; purchased the right to publish the forty-five paperback volumes. Twelve bilingual (Japanese-English) manga volumes were published by Kodansha between 1997 and 1999 as &quot;The Wonderful World of Sazae-San&quot;. The volumes were re-released in 2004, and in 2015 another three bilingual manga volumes were released as &quot;The Best of Sazae-san&quot;. By 1999, it has sold over 86 million copies.&quot;Sazae-san&quot; won the 8th Bungeishunjū Manga Award in 1962.

===Anime===

In October 1969, Fuji Television started an anime series, which is still on the air today and currently in production, making it one of the longest-running scripted TV series in history and the longest running animated show. The broadcast time is every Sunday from 18:30 to 19:00 and has never been changed since its inception. The format is in the form of three vignettes. The anime series has some characters, like Katsuo&#x27;s classmates, who have not appeared in Hasegawa&#x27;s original works.

On September 5, 2013, the anime achieved the Guinness World Record for the &quot;Longest running animated TV series&quot;. As of November 2021, there have been over 2250 episodes aired.

The stories are based on at least one strip of the original manga. Due to the limited number of strips, different episodes are based on the same strips. In addition, the unique culture and events in a typical Japanese household, including the four seasons, will always be reflected in the story.

At the start of the anime, it was a slapstick comedy with references to Tom and Jerry, Looney Tunes, etc, but within a year the genre shifted towards a family drama. From this point onward, there has been no major change in style for more than 50 years, in either directing, scriptwriting, or character design. Also because of its popularity, a survey conducted by NIPPON RESEARCH CENTER, LTD. (NRC) in 2020 recorded a high recognition rate of 97% for this anime in Japan. For this reason, it is often described as a &quot;national anime&quot; in Japan and is regarded as a symbol of &quot;universality&quot; and &quot;permanence&quot;. Whenever a change is made, such as a change in voice actors, there is always a great deal of media coverage, and the anime retains a strong influence on the public.

In recent years, due to the influence of its unchanging style, it is sometimes criticized as being &quot;anachronistic&quot; or a &quot;period piece&quot;, such as the absence of smartphones and convenience stores in the setting even though the time period is the present day. In response to this, the staff stated, &quot;The appeal of this anime is that it depicts scenes of everyday life and universal relationships that can be found in any family. Therefore, we have no plans in the future to incorporate events or items that would change them.&quot; However, some things which have come to be considered inappropriate due to changing times, such as smoking and corporal punishment, have been removed or otherwise addressed.

The anime is not well known outside of Japan, as it has never been exported overseas or otherwise developed globally due to the wishes of the rights holders. However, in 2019, the producer said in a conversation that he hopes to be able to expand globally in the future.

As for voice actors, as of 2023, only Midori Katō, who plays Sazae, has never been changed. Katō was recognized by Guinness World Records in 2019 as the &quot;Longest career as a voice actor for the same character of an animated TV series&quot;. As of 2008, 40 years after the anime was first broadcast, four of the seven main characters were the original cast members, but in 2014 Ichirō Nagai, who played Namihei, was replaced due to his sudden death at age 82, and the following year Miyoko Asō, who played Fune, was changed to reflect her age at 89. Takako Sasuga, who played Tarao, died suddenly in 2023 at the age of 87 and was replaced.

The opening is an introduction to the places that Sazae has traveled to and visited throughout Japan. The settings change approximately every three months. Because of the popularity of the anime, this has come to be viewed by cities as a &quot;cost-effective means of promoting tourism,&quot; and since 2000, the program has received approximately 5–10 million yen in aid from prefectures and municipalities wishing to introduce the program.

Since November 1991, after the closing credits and the next episode previews, each show has ended with a janken match between Sazae and the viewers at home, in which Sazae holds up a sign representing one of the appropriate hand gestures. From 1969 until October 1991, Sazae ended each episode by tossing a bean or rice cake in the air and catching it in her mouth. Fuji Television switched to the janken match after doctors at Tohoku University Hospital and the National Center for Child Health and Development raised concerns that children may try to imitate Sazae and potentially choke on food.

The anime series was originally sponsored solely by Toshiba—Later, in 1998, the program expanded to other sponsors, but the association between Toshiba and Sazae-san remained strong. When Toshiba withdrew its sponsorship due to poor management, it was widely covered in the media.

&quot;Sazae-san&quot; was the last animated television series to use traditional cel animation, although as of April 2009, the opening credits were digital; the series finally switched to fully digital animation in 2013. Despite the series being a hit, Hasegawa stated that she never wanted any merchandise to be made for it, including home video rights, making availability of past episodes, especially those prior to the introduction of the VCR, very rare. Following her death, her request to prohibit older episodes from being released in home media was honored. Despite this, however, Fuji TV made an agreement with Amazon Prime Video in December 2018 to release the 1969 and early-to-mid 1970s episodes available on their streaming service. Some episodes from the mid-2000s are also on the service.

The Opening Song and Ending Song are original songs sung by Yuko Uno. Since the anime first started airing, the audio itself has not been altered in any way, such as by arrangement, although it was trimmed to fit the length of the sequences during the early years of airing.

There have been two previous suspensions of animation production: the first, for about a month beginning in February 1975, due to the 1970s energy crisis; the second, for about a month beginning in May 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Programming during these periods was handled by rebroadcasting past productions.

In Japan, there is a term called &quot;Sazae-san syndrome&quot; (サザエさん症候群, &quot;Sazae-san shōkōgun&quot;), which refers to a depressed mood on Sunday night after an episode has finished on television, reminding people that the weekend is coming to an end.

<text>Shirley Verrett (May 31, 1931 – November 5, 2010) was an American operatic mezzo-soprano who successfully transitioned into soprano roles making her a Soprano sfogato. Verrett enjoyed great fame from the late 1960s through the 1990s; she was particularly known for performing works by Giuseppe Verdi and Gaetano Donizetti.

== Life and career ==
=== Early life and education ===
Born into an African-American family of devout Catholics in New Orleans, Verrett was raised in Los Angeles. She recalled in her memoir that her mother went from being a strict Catholic to an even stricter Seventh-Day Adventist, and she and her siblings were educated in a Seventh Day Adventist school system. She sang in church and showed early musical abilities, but initially a singing career was frowned upon by her family. 

Verrett attended Oakwood University, a private historically black Seventh-Day Adventist university in Huntsville, Alabama, for a semester in 1949, but then returned to southern California and completed an associate degree in real estate at Ventura College. Though successful as a real estate agent, Verrett reconsidered her career choice and started serious voice study. In 1955, she won two California state competitions sponsored by the Young Musicians Foundation, and later that year she appeared on Talent Scouts, a national television show hosted by Arthur Godfrey. Her appearance on that program led to a scholarship at the Juilliard School New York. Verrett went on to study with Anna Fitziu and with Marion Szekely Freschl at Juilliard. In 1961, she won the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions.

=== International career ===
In 1957, Verrett made her operatic debut in Britten&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of Lucretia&quot; under her then-married name of Shirley Carter. She later used the name Shirley Verrett-Carter, and ultimately just Shirley Verrett. In 1958, she made her New York City Opera debut as Irina in Kurt Weill&#x27;s &quot;Lost in the Stars&quot;. In 1959, she made her European debut at the Cologne Opera in Nicolas Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Rasputins Tod&quot;. In 1962, she received critical acclaim for portraying Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; at the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto; she repeated the role at the Bolshoi Theatre in 1963, and at the New York City Opera in 1964 (opposite Richard Cassilly and Norman Treigle). Verrett first appeared at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in 1966 as Ulrica in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;.

Verrett appeared in the first concert ever televised from Lincoln Center in 1962, and also appeared that year in the first of the Leonard Bernstein &quot;Young People&#x27;s Concerts&quot; televised from that venue, in what is now David Geffen Hall.

In 1968, Verrett made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera as Carmen, and at La Scala in 1969 in Saint-Saëns&#x27; &quot;Samson and Dalila&quot;. Verrett&#x27;s mezzo roles included Cassandra and Didon in Berlioz&#x27; &quot;Les Troyens&quot;, including its Met premiere, when she sang both roles in the same performance, Verdi&#x27;s Ulrica in &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;, Amneris in &quot;Aida&quot;, Eboli in &quot;Don Carlo&quot; and Azucena in &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, Donizetti&#x27;s Elisabetta I (written as a soprano role) in &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; and Leonora in &quot;La favorita&quot;, Orfeo in Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;, and Rossinis Neocles in &quot;L&#x27;assedio di Corinto&quot; and Sinaide in &quot;Moïse&quot;. Most of these roles were recorded, either professionally or privately.

Beginning in the late 1970s, Verrett began to tackle soprano roles, including Selika in &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot;, Judith in Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot;, Lady Macbeth in &quot;Macbeth&quot;, Madame Lidoine in Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues of the Carmelites&quot; (Met 1977), Tosca, Norma (from Boston 1976 till Messina 1989), Aida (Boston 1980 and 1989), Desdemona (&quot;Otello&quot;) (1981), Leonore (&quot;Fidelio&quot;, Met 1983), Iphigénie (1984–85), Alceste (1985), and Médée (Luigi Cherubini) (1986). In December 1978, Verrett sang the role of &quot;Tosca&quot; in a &quot;Live from the Met&quot; television broadcast opposite Luciano Pavarotti as Cavaradossi and Cornell MacNeil as Scarpia.

In 1990, Verrett sang Didon in &quot;Les Troyens&quot; at the inauguration of the Opéra Bastille in Paris, and added a new role to her repertoire: Santuzza in Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, in Siena. In 1994, she made her Broadway debut in the Tony Award-winning revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Carousel&quot; at Lincoln Center&#x27;s Vivian Beaumont Theater, playing Nettie Fowler.

In 1996, Verrett joined the faculty of the University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre &amp; Dance as a professor of voice and the James Earl Jones Distinguished University Professor of Voice. The preceding year, at the National Opera Association Gala Banquet and Concert honoring Mattiwilda Dobbs, Todd Duncan, Camilla Williams, and Robert McFerrin, Verrett said: 
=== Personal life ===
Verrett married twice, first in 1951, to real estate broker and sheriff&#x27;s deputy James L. Carter. However, Verrett experienced abusive treatment from her husband and they divorced in 1959. In 1963, she wed artist Louis Lo Monaco. She was survived by Lo Monaco and their adopted daughter and their granddaughter. She was also the estranged paternal aunt of the controversial American media personality Durek Verrett.

Verrett died in Ann Arbor, Michigan, aged 79, on November 5, 2010, from heart failure following an undisclosed illness. An ongoing annual Shirley Verrett Award, that recognizes “a faculty member whose performance, scholarship, or service supports the success of female students or faculty in the arts who come from diverse cultural and racial backgrounds” was established in 2011 by the University of Michigan in her honor.

== Autobiography ==
In 2003, Shirley Verrett published a memoir, &quot;I Never Walked Alone&quot; (), in which she spoke frankly about the racism she encountered as a black person in the American classical music world. When the conductor Leopold Stokowski invited her to sing with the Houston Symphony in the early 1960s, he had to rescind his invitation when the orchestra board refused to accept a black soloist. Stokowski later made amends by giving her a prestigious date with the Philadelphia Orchestra.

<text>Eric Matthew Schlosser (born August 17, 1959) is an American journalist and food writer. He is known for his books &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot; (2001), &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; (2003), and &quot;Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety&quot; (2013).

==Biography==
Schlosser was born in New York City, New York; he spent his childhood there and in Los Angeles, California. His parents are Judith (née Gassner) and Herbert Schlosser, a former Wall Street lawyer who turned to broadcasting later in his career, eventually becoming president of NBC in 1974 and later becoming a vice president of RCA.

Schlosser graduated with an A.B. in history from Princeton University in 1982 after completing a 148-page-long senior thesis titled &quot;Academic Freedom during the McCarthy Era: Anti-Communism, Conformity and Princeton.&quot; He then earned a Master of Letters in British Imperial History from Oriel College, Oxford. He tried playwriting, writing two plays, &quot;Americans&quot; (1985) and &quot;We the People&quot; (2007). He is married to Shauna Redford, daughter of actor Robert Redford.

===Journalism and books===
Schlosser started his career as a journalist with &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; in Boston, Massachusetts. He quickly gained recognition for his investigative pieces, earning two awards within two years of joining the staff: he won the National Magazine Award for his reporting in his two-part series &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; and &quot;Marijuana and the Law&quot; (&quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, August and September 1994), and he won the Sidney Hillman Foundation award for his article &quot;In the Strawberry Fields&quot; (&quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, November 19, 1995).
Schlosser wrote &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot; (2001), an exposé on the unsanitary and discriminatory practices of the fast food industry. &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot; evolved from a two-part article in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The book won the 2002 Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Nonfiction. Schlosser helped adapt his book into a 2006 film directed by Richard Linklater. The film opened November 19, 2006. &quot;Chew On This&quot; (2006), co-written with Charles Wilson, is an adaptation of the book for younger readers. &quot;Fortune&quot; called &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot; the &quot;Best Business Book of the Year&quot; in 2001.

His 2003 book &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; discusses the history and current trade of marijuana, the use of migrant workers in California strawberry fields, and the American pornography industry and its history. William F. Buckley gave &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; a favorable review, as did &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;.

Schlosser&#x27;s book &quot;Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety&quot; was published in September 2013. It focuses on the 1980 Damascus Titan missile explosion, a non-nuclear explosion of a Titan II missile near Damascus, AR. &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s Louis Menand called it &quot;excellent&quot; and &quot;hair-raising&quot; and said that &quot;&quot;Command and Control&quot; is how nonfiction should be written.&quot; It was a finalist for the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for History.

He has been working on a book on the American prison system, which has been over 10 years in the making.

==Films and awards==
Schlosser appeared in an interview for the DVD of Morgan Spurlock&#x27;s &quot;Super Size Me&quot;, having a one-on-one discussion with the filmmaker about the fast-food industry. He did not appear in the film itself. He was interviewed by Franny Armstrong in 2005 and is a feature interviewee in her film &quot;McLibel&quot;. 

Schlosser appeared in the 2008 documentary, &quot;Food, Inc.&quot;, and the 2023 sequel &quot;Food, Inc. 2&quot; with Michael Pollan.

Schlosser also served as co-executive producer on the 2007 film &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot;. In 2014, he was an executive producer of the farmworker documentary &quot;Food Chains,&quot; a credit he shared with Eva Longoria. They both won a James Beard Foundation Award for their roles. Schlosser also shared a director credit for the multimedia installation entitled &quot;the bomb&quot;, an experimental film about nuclear weaponry coupled with a live score by The Acid.

<text>Sharon Ventura, also known as She-Thing, is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. She has used the pseudonym Ms. Marvel and has served as a member of the Fantastic Four and the female wrestlers known as the Grapplers.

==Publication history==

Created by Mike Carlin and Ron Wilson, the character first appeared in &quot;Thing&quot; #27 (September 1985).

==Fictional character biography==

Sharon Ventura met Thing at the time when he was involved with the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation (UCWF). Inspired by him, she signed up for the Power Broker&#x27;s program in order to have her strength augmented and join the UCWF. The Power Broker (actually Curtiss Jackson), employed Dr. Karl Malus to create super-powered wrestlers for his competitions. Sharon was unaware of the criminal activities of Jackson or Malus. While boosting their subjects&#x27; strength, the pair addicted the subjects to a drug, ensuring their obedience. It has been implied that she was raped while a prisoner of Malus, which caused her to temporarily develop an intense hatred and distrust of men. Sharon managed to break free before Malus administered the drug. She adopted the costume which UCWF minder Ann Fraley (Auntie Freeze) had arranged for her, taking the name Ms. Marvel. Alongside the Thing, she battled the Grapplers and the UCWF wrestlers. She then battled the She-Hulk.

Later, Sharon was used by the Power Broker to determine if the augmentation could be reversed. Alongside Captain America, she battled the Power Broker.

Sharon later joined the Fantastic Four, and alongside the Fantastic Four she battled Diablo. Shortly after joining the Fantastic Four, Sharon was mutated by cosmic rays and took on strength and appearance similar to that of Ben Grimm, a.k.a. the Thing. Although she never officially retired her Ms. Marvel moniker, she became more popularly known as the She-Thing and it is by this name she is most known to comic book fans. She later first encountered Aron the Rogue Watcher, and battled the She-Hulk. With She-Hulk, She-Thing battled Dragon Man. With the Fantastic Four and Frightful Four, she was captured by Aron. They escaped and defeated their clones. Sharon later battled the Hulk. She-Thing was offered the chance to be human again by Doctor Doom while a then-powerless Ben Grimm chose to use one of Reed Richards&#x27; machines to revert to the Thing to save She-Thing. Alongside the Fantastic Four, she battled the Time Variance Authority. She-Thing left the Fantastic Four soon after and began working for Doctor Doom. Sharon claimed to be doing this so that Doom would cure Ben as he had her. She was sent by Doctor Doom to spy on the Fantastic Four, where she first met Alicia Masters. With Mister Fantastic and the Thing, she was captured by Aron, but rescued by the Molecule Man and Doctor Doom. Alongside the Fantastic Four, she battled the Secret Defenders. Alongside the Fantastic Four, Lyja, and the Inhumans, she battled Doctor Doom. When she refused to betray her friends in the Fantastic Four to Doctor Doom, Doom spitefully mutated her into a much more monstrous form. After a bout of insanity, she briefly joined the Frightful Four and battered Sue Storm Richards to within inches of her life.

Years later, She-Thing had a guest appearance in &quot;Marvel Knights 4&quot; #21 (2005), a spinoff of the main &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; book. The appearance established that she was indeed alive and well in the Marvel Universe and her attire implied she was still residing with Wingfoot. Her absence was poked fun at, as she stated that she could not believe anybody still had her number.

Sharon Ventura was later seen again in her She-Thing form.

During the 2008 &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline, a Skrull impersonating Sharon&#x27;s &quot;She-Thing&quot; persona is killed by the Skrull Kill Krew. The real Sharon is recovered alive from a downed Skrull ship after the final battle of the invasion. Sharon attends a support group meeting with the others who were replaced by Skrulls.

Sharon has since been revealed as a prisoner in the Raft, with evidence suggesting that she is part of a plot to destabilize the Fantastic Four.

Following the 2015 &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, Ventura has returned to her original human appearance, and has been seen wrestling in her original outfit.

==Powers and abilities==
As Ms. Marvel, Sharon had superhuman strength and endurance, thanks to augmentation of her physical attributes by Dr. Karl Malus on behalf of the Power Broker. The mutagenic effect due to exposure to cosmic radiation that turned her into the She-Thing later greatly increased her physical attributes, especially her durability.

Sharon is highly proficient in hand-to-hand combat, and skilled at various martial arts, including tae kwon do and American boxing. She is also an expert stuntwoman, scuba diver, skydiver, motorcyclist, mountain climber, skier, lion tamer, and wrestler. She attended a military academy until she was expelled.

As part of Ben Grimm&#x27;s Fantastic Four, she demonstrated her intelligence by solving complicated situations with her intuition and cunning. She stated that she was always the top student in school.

<doc id="751050" wikidata="Q729322" url="?curid=751050" title="Autobianchi Y10">
<text>The Autobianchi Y10 is a supermini and economy car manufactured from 1985 to 1995 and marketed under the Lancia brand in most export markets (as Lancia Y10). The car was manufactured at Fiat&#x27;s Autobianchi plant in Desio, Milan until 1992 and after that in Arese, near Alfa Romeo&#x27;s plants. In addition to a relatively high level of trim for its market segment, the Y10 featured a new rear rigid axle suspension design (called Omega axle), subsequently shared with the facelifted Fiat Panda. In spite of its short overall length, the Y10 had a drag coefficient of just 0.31.

Production totaled approximately 850,000 in the first seven years, in spite of being a pricier, more niche-oriented product than its Fiat siblings. In addition to unique style and luxurious trim, the Y10&#x27;s aerodynamics increased the fuel economy. Sales in the United Kingdom were never strong, and it was withdrawn in late 1991. This was more than two years before Lancia withdrew entirely from Britain and all other RHD markets. Lancia remained in the segment in left-hand drive markets with the similarly marketed Ypsilon.

== Specification ==

The Autobianchi Y10 made its official debut at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1985 as a replacement for the fifteen-year-old A112. It lost out for the title of European Car of the Year for 1986 to the Ford Scorpio.

=== Design ===
The A112 remained on sale, alongside the Y10, almost to the end of 1986. The Y10 was sold under the Autobianchi marque in Italy, Portugal, France, and Japan. In most other markets it was sold under the Lancia marque. In Portugal it remained an Autobianchi until 1989, and was badged Lancia thenceforth.
The Y10&#x27;s most important design innovation was the vertical tail cut-off, characterized by the tailgate painted in black satin, regardless of the colour chosen for the body. The notable wedge shape of the small body is very aerodynamic (formula_1 0.31) thanks to the hood, which is inclined towards the curved windscreen, and side windows that were mounted flush with the bodywork, as well as the absence of drip rails, the recessed door handles and roof tapering slightly toward the back.

All these features were unique for a small car in 1985 and were developed by the Fiat Style Centre, at that time led by Vittorio Ghidella. The definition of the project Y10 took more than three years of study. It was necessary that this car have a very specific identity to allow it to be unequivocally placed under the Lancia brand. The appointments were originally entrusted to Pininfarina and Giorgetto Giugiaro as well as the Fiat Style Centre. Hundreds of drawings were executed with sketches and scale models starting as early as 1980. Eventually a design by the Fiat Style Centre was selected and developed that best responded to the theme of a car destined for a particular user, &quot;select and elite&quot;, a real flagship miniature desired by women as much as a handbag and identified by men as their favorite perfume.

The car had rectangular headlights, which, together with a simple grille. The windshield, installed with silicone resin instead of a rubber gasket, was large, sloped and characterized by a single wiper. The side was characterized by a belt line from the base of the hood rising gradually as it approaches the lower edge of the tailgate, delimited by the wrap-around taillights. 

The Y10 was offered only with a three-door body with relatively large doors, offering easy access even for rear passengers. The tailgate was on a nearly vertical plane, hinged to make it more practical to access the luggage compartment by shifting the point of rotation eleven centimeters towards the center of the roof. The rear lights were of a horizontal layout, similar to the A112 with a wrap around rear bumper fascia.

The car shares mechanicals with the Fiat Panda and was largely conventional in its layout, with a transversely mounted engine and front- or four-wheel-drive. The fuel capacity, at , was at least fifty percent more than what was usual for the class.

=== Interior ===

The interior was carpeted and featured cloth upholstery on the seats and optional Alcantara upholstery on the dashboard, seats and door panels, and options such as electric windows, central locking, split rear bench seat, rear window hinged electrically, glass sunroof and climate control system with electronic controls and LED display, similar to that already adopted on Fiat Regata.

== First series (1985–1988) ==
The attention and interest shown by the international public at the Geneva Motor Show, gave Fiat-Lancia Group hope that the new Y10 met the public&#x27;s taste, but sales in the first month struggled. There were few people prepared to pay the Y10&#x27;s asking price. In 1985 Autobianchi-Lancia assembled 63,495 Y10s, to be compared with 88,292 of the aging A112 having been built the year before. As a response, Lancia readjusted the lineup with a lower-priced Y10 Fire entry model while adding equipment to the rest of the range. Technically speaking, according to an official communique from the time of introduction, the model names were to be written in lower-caps (&quot;Y10 fire, touring, turbo&quot;).

All versions came with a five speed gearbox, front-wheel drive, a front transverse engine, a MacPherson strut suspension and a front and rear rigid &quot;omega&quot; axle.

=== 1985 ===
Y10 Fire was equipped with the new four-cylinder Fire (Fully Integrated Robotised Engine), with displacement of and maximum power of at 5000 rpm, with low fuel consumption, low noise, low-power, allowing it to exceed and to accelerate from in 16 seconds.

Y10 Touring: It was powered by a Brazilian-built motor of , which was also used in the Brazilian Fiat Uno. This has a maximum power of at 5850 rpm and maximum torque of at 3000 rpm, and was developed from Fiat&#x27;s Lampredi-designed four-cylinder that originally equipped the Fiat 127. The Touring is externally identical to the Y10 Fire, aside from the trunk badging, while on the carrier can be seen the Alcantara in place of the fabric coverings. The Touring had a maximum speed of and acceleration from in 14.5 seconds.

Y10 Turbo: The turbo had the same basic Brazilian FIASA engine as the Touring. However, it was equipped with an IHI turbocharger with intercooler, with a maximum power of at 5750 rpm and maximum torque of at 2750 rpm. Compared to the naturally aspirated 1050 in the Touring, it was distinguished by sodium filled exhaust valves, electric fuel pump, and a Magneti Marelli electronic ignition &quot;Digiplex&quot;. It boasted a Turbocharging system from Formula 1 in miniature with intercooler, bypass valve, and thermostatic valve. This version had a top speed of and accelerated from in 9.5 seconds. It was externally recognizable by the presence of a red piping on the bumpers, for the adhesive band at the base of the side with the writing Turbo, larger bumpers at the front to accommodate the intercooler, and at the rear to accommodate the transversal exhaust backbox exclusive to this model with a polished tail pipe. This model was larger than the other versions and quieter on the inside. It had an unusual wheel design with some models being equipped with metric wheels size 340mm ( in between 13 and 14 inches) and sportier seats as well as different molding and wrapping, plus more analog instruments including a Turbo pressure gauge.

=== 1986 ===
In 1986, new versions were added and some of them were less expensive. The range included models from Fire, Fire LX, Touring and Turbo. All had the required height adjustable steering wheel. The sales finally began to grow. At the end of 1986 a 4WD version was introduced; total production of all models in 1986 was 80,403 units.

Y10 Fire: The new entry-level version, the Fire, was now standard equipment with a lower price, estimated at one million lire. This model was recognizable by the front with a frame in matte black and black grille, (in contrast to the 1985 Fire, which had a polished stainless steel frame and a grid in silver), the taillights were simplified and asymmetrical, with only a reversing light to the right and only one headlight on the left rear fog light. Inside had cloth upholstery and a new dashboard. There were no doors on compartments or drawers.

Y10 Fire LX: Between the Fire and the Touring was a new model, the Fire LX. In essence, it was the 1985 version of the Fire, and differed from the new basic version. It looked richer and had self-closing drawers and compartments, was upholstered in Alcantara. Electric windows, central locking, an overhead digital clock, Borletti Veglia Flash and reading lights were all standard.

Y10 Touring: The Touring version remained unchanged in price but offered more equipment that included front electric windows, central locking and a digital clock. The engine remained the same, the naturally aspirated 1049 cc four.

Y10 Turbo: The Y10 Turbo (similar to the Touring) offered standard front electric windows, central locking and an internal digital clock. It had an improved finish from previous models with better plastic assembled products. Some models offered rear electric windows, digital clima-control and Alcantara interior. 

Y10 4WD: At the end of October 1986, the range was extended further. It debuted the Y10 4WD, four-wheel drive version (derived from the same traction system of Panda 4x4 and produced in joint venture with Steyr), equipped with Fire from , with power increased to reach at 5500 rpm. It could be called a true SUV ahead of its time for its design, finishes and its mechanical contents. The all-wheel drive could be implemented by a button on the dash, and a complex and modern electro-pneumatic system allowed, four-wheel drive off, leaving firm transmission shaft and rear axle shafts, the pull was inserted by pressing the button, the engine is running and the car is stopped or at least at speeds below , where the traction was inserted over this speed, the wheel would fit only slowing below and also to prevent accumulation of ice, mud or snow clogging the system actuators of the transmission control, it was automatically inserted by turning off the engine. It was easy to recognize the 4WD thanks to the large lateral fascia of plastic material, the wheel rims of a specific design without any hub caps, and the front and rear splash guard; to distinguish it further unique identification was written on the tailgate, on the side shields and the splash guard as standard. Inside was a novel covered steering wheel. The standard package included: a right external mirror, optional headlamp cleaning system, instrumentation and control system with tachometer, sunroof, electric windows, central locking, split rear seat, and a steering wheel adjustable for height. The Y10 4WD had a top speed of and accelerates from 0 to in 17.4 seconds.

=== 1987–1988 ===
In the period 1987–88 the small Autobianchi became an increasingly mature product, with a precise position in the market attracting a varied clientele. It had now achieved its expected success, and made itself noticed at automotive events with presentation of &quot;special series&quot; of enhanced and exclusive versions, with features and details in their own right, that were not available on other cars once again to emphasize the variety available to buyers of the Y10. Twenty years later, special versions related to a brand, not necessarily in the automotive field, are visible to all and are now a permanent part of the vast majority of manufacturers&#x27; lists. These were trendy vehicles that were good looking and linked to specific lifestyles and acted as &quot;status symbols&quot; indicative of belonging to specific a group. In 1987, 109,708 Y10s were assembled bringing the total built since 1985 to 254,000.

Alongside the classic versions of the list are also run special versions.

Y10 Fila: The first special version to debut in February 1987, was the Y10 Fila, a model aimed primarily at young and dynamic customers – a Biella signed homonym of sports and leisure. Mechanically derived from the Y10 Fire (range 1986), which retained the standard accessories, it was very easy to recognize because they were fully painted in white: not only the body but also the tailgate, bumpers, grille front and wheel trims. To break the monotony adhesive strips in black and blue (or Black and Red), ran along the beltline, culminating towards the door, with the famous mark. The seats and door panels were covered with blue (or Red) fabric, and the Fila logo was placed on the backs of front seats. The success of this first special version, led to a second version, called Fila 2 whose body was painted black, this time excluding hubcaps, bumpers and front grille. The strip that ran along the side wall was white and red as was the interior&#x27;s fabric.

Y10 Martini: The Y10 Martini released a few months following the first edition of Fila, arrived at dealerships in June 1987. Made to celebrate the sporting association with Martini &amp; Rossi, which for decades connected the Lancia successes in the racing world with his incomparable Delta, the Y10 Martini came had a Turbo and was available only in white. White was also used for wheel covers (available as optional alloy wheels) while the bumpers were, wrap around and lowered, the Turbo was unpainted. The side was covered by a strip with the colors of the Martini racing team&#x27;s winning colours, which were also used for the seat fabric and door panels.

Y10 Missoni: In October 1987, the Y10 Missoni, derived from the Fire LX and signed by the famous fashion designer Ottavio Missoni (who appeared in a television spot next to his creation), was released. He chose the colour Memphis Blue for the body exclusive with black doors. The colour was used for interior fabrics, and the Alcantara dashboard and door panels were made of hazelnut. The seats had a fabric &quot;Missonato&quot; velvet stripe, and the carpet was coordinated with the exterior colour. To make this version recognizable, on the back part of the side, halfway between the rib and the rear window, the Missoni mark was applied.

== Second series (1989–1992) ==
In February 1989, the Autobianchi Y10 presented the second series, characterized by minor revisions in the interior and to the engine.

All models now had: newly designed wheel trims (except the 4WD), white front indicators, rear lights (symmetrical and now the same for all versions) made in two colours; double reverse light-colored smoke, dual projector fog red, side lights and stop (double stranded) in red and smoked blinkers.

The Fire had a new radiator grille, the outer frame trimmed with stainless steel since 1986, but this version had a single colored grid devoid of chrome. Inside the back seat was changed to increase the load capacity of the trunk, making the car&#x27;s shape more vertical and less padded. The door panels changed and now included buttons at the bottom of the front door, electric windows (optional on Fire), and speakers. The dash remained without doors or compartments. A new fabric was used for the upholstery.

All new models had instrument panels with new graphics, and, except for the Fire, an adjustable steering wheel for height. Air conditioning was now standard and provided a manual internal recirculation function or, on request, a new digital climate control system, this time with electronic temperature control with display including an &quot;auto&quot; setting for the maintenance of constant temperature.

The previous range including the Fire, the Fire LX, Touring, the Turbo and the special series. Only the Fire remained as all other versions went out of production along with the engine. This engine was replaced by the Fire of , which debuted in 1988 with the launch of the Fiat Tipo and, in the case of Y10, was equipped with electronic fuel injection and characterized by a maximum power of at 5500 rpm and a maximum torque of at 3000 rpm – i.e. the Fire LX, could reach and accelerate from in 13.9 seconds.

The Y10 was withdrawn from sale on the British market at the end of 1991, by which time Lancia sales were in steep decline, not helped by the recession. Just over two years later Lancia withdrew from Britain completely.

=== 1989 and introduction of electronic injection ===

Y10 GT i.e.: The 1050 turbo engine was dropped because of pollution regulations in countries like Switzerland, Austria and Germany. The new engine, made in Brazil, had fuel injection with electronic Multi Point (&quot;Bosch L3.1 Jetronic&quot;), and was derived from previous 1050. It was able to pull a maximum power of at 5750 rpm and a maximum torque of at 3250 rpm. This equipped the new 1300 GT i.e. version with the capability to reaching and accelerate from in 11.5 seconds. It also promised more comfort and a smoother drive than the raucous turbo version. With the discontinuation of the Turbo, performance was somewhat adversely affected, but the GT was much more &quot;usable&quot; becoming more of an &quot;all-rounder&quot; GT. The GT is characterized by: a red border that frames the front grill, by an adhesive strip with the mark of identification which runs through the lower edge of the side, by original hubcaps (optional alloy wheels), and chrome tailpipe. The instrumentation as well as for the previous Turbo, is more complete and sporty.

Y10 Fire LX i.e. (and Selectronic version): The new Y10 Fire LX i.e. was recognized externally by the lower bumper painted in the body color, the adhesive strip, with the mark of identification, which runs through the lower edge of the side and the chrome tailpipe. Internally there were cloth seats or, on request, upholstery in Alcantara. The dashboard and door panels are upholstered in Alcantara as a standard.

In December 1989, Autobianchi, debuted the Y10 Selectronic automatic transmission version with ECVT: Electronic Continuously Variable Transmission. Moved by a Fire engine Single Point Injection of LX (i.e., the Selectronic automatic transmission has a continuously variable relationships with the electromagnetic clutch – not hydraulic like the Fiat Uno Selecta), in reaches a top speed of and accelerates from in 15 seconds. The CVT transmission was produced by Japanese Fuji and was the same as that used in the Subaru Justy.

Y10 4WD i.e.: The 4WD, all wheel drive can be inserted, changed its engine from 1000 to the Fire 1100 Fire electronic ignition Single Point of LX. With the new engine, the 4WD could reach and accelerate from in 15 seconds. The external appearance remained unchanged, retaining the lateral end of the previous version.

=== 1990–1992 ===
A few months later, in March 1990, a range of Y10 catalysed models was announced. For each existing version there was a corresponding model with a catalytic converter, with the exception of Fire carburetor, which remained the top seller thanks to its lower asking price and overall economy.

The engine, was called &quot;Europa&quot; in accordance with EU Directives, in an ecological version reached a maximum power of , sufficient to allow the LX to reach , the Selectronic to reach and i 4WD to reach . The catalyzed version of the GT i.e. had a engine with a maximum power of , which allowed a top speed of .

Y10 Mia The Y10 Mia introduced the ability to customize the colour scheme for the dashboard, door panels and upholstery with a choice of different shades of Alcantara (ice, camel beige, turquoise and red carmine). The Mia accounted for almost 40% of total production in 1991–92.

Y10 Ego: Two months later, in September 1991, the Ego was introduced. The LX version was based on the Fire. It was only available with a Black Mica body color (including the tailgate), was completely covered in saddle leather (&quot;Poltrona Frau&quot;) &quot;Bulgarian Red&quot; hue – as well as the dashboard, gear lever, door panels and steering wheel. It had no foam, and had upholstered front headrests and improved tires.

Y10 Avenue In early 1992, as a result of the success of the special version of the Mia, the Y10 Avenue was released. It had the tailgate colour coordinated with the body. The Avenue could also be ordered with Selectronic automatic transmission.

Y10 Marazzi Certa: Derived from Avenue, the Y10 Certa was prepared by Carrozzeria Marazzi and presented at the 1992 Turin Motor Show. Now dubbed by the press as &quot;utilitarian abduction prevention&quot;, the car had been designed to offer greater resistance to attempts of aggression, with reinforced door structure, locks and bar-proof glass. An available option included a little safe in the cockpit, for the transport of any personal objects. Designed for women, at the time of its launch it had a planned annual production limited to 300, priced at 24 million lire.

== Third series (1992–1995) ==
In 1992 the Y10 underwent a facelift, with changes to the interior and the exterior. The front end received a new grille, and was more compact; but also more in keeping with the style of the latest Lancia vehicles, the headlights were smaller and longer while the front bumpers had a new design. The distinctive black rear design was now partially body coloured, and new taillights identified the new model.

From 1985 to 1992 Autobianchi-Lancia assembled over 850,000 Y10 models.

<text>Neal Shaw Blaisdell (November 6, 1902 – November 5, 1975) served as Mayor of Honolulu from 1955 to 1969 as a member of the Hawaii Republican Party. As chief executive of the City and County of Honolulu, Hawaii, he oversaw one of the largest construction booms in city and county history, working closely with Governor John A. Burns. Blaisdell was the sitting mayor when Hawaii became the 50th U.S. state on August 21, 1959.

==Early life==

Blaisdell was born in Honolulu and had European and Hawaiian ancestry.
His father was William Wallace Blaisdell II, who served as fire chief of Honolulu; and his mother was Maliaka &quot;Malie&quot; Alaneao Merseberg.
A maternal great-grandfather was John Adams Cummins.
A paternal great-grandfather, John Blaisdell (1812–1889), came to the Hawaiian Islands from Maine in 1849.

==Education and athletics==
Known as &quot;Rusty&quot;, Blaisdell played basketball, football and baseball at Saint Louis School.
He attended the University of Hawaii and later transferred to Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, where he was quarterback of the school&#x27;s football team, graduating in 1926. He was also a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. He received Bucknell&#x27;s Alumni Award for Meritorious Achievement in 1968. Although Blaisdell also played basketball and baseball, he was inducted into the Bucknell Athletic Hall of Fame in 1988 in the football category. He was also a golfer, and started his day with push-ups. He returned to Honolulu to become a teacher, high school coach and athletic director.

==Public service==
Blaisdell was elected representative of the 4th district to the legislature of the Territory of Hawaii in 1945, and the territorial senate in 1947 and 1949.
In 1950 he ran for Mayor of Honolulu, but withdrew after suffering from tuberculosis.

Blaisdell ran against Frank Fasi and was elected in 1954, taking office in 1955. As mayor, he oversaw the construction of the John H. Wilson Tunnels through the Koʻolau Range from Kalihi Valley; and erected the Hawaii International Center, a multipurpose complex with a concert hall, convention center, exhibition hall and sports arena. After Blaisdell&#x27;s death, his successor, Fasi, renamed the complex in Blaisdell&#x27;s honor; is now known as the Neal S. Blaisdell Center.

From 1965 to 1966, Blaisdell was president of the United States Conference of Mayors.

==Death and legacy==
Blaisdell married Lucy Thurston on October 23, 1926. Their daughter Velma Blaisdell Clark married James Kalaeone Clark and was a teacher for the Hawai`i State Department of Education. Their daughter Marilyn Blaisdell Ane married another football coach and taught at Punahou School for 28 years. 

Blaisdell suffered a stroke while doing yard work and died on November 5, 1975, one day shy of his 73rd birthday. He is buried at Oahu Cemetery.

A park of on the shore of Pearl Harbor (at ) was named for him.

<text>The Parker Duofold is a range of fountain pens produced by the Parker Pen Company.

== History ==
The first model was produced in 1921 and was a large pen – 5.5 inches long when capped. It was made of a showy bright red hard rubber and expensively priced at $7.00, .

The original full-sized Duofold was soon joined by the smaller Duofold Junior, Duofold Special, and Lady Duofold. While the Junior and Special could also be fitted with Parker’s Washer Clip, the Lady Duofold was available with a Chatelaine, or Ring Top for hanging around one&#x27;s neck. The Ring Top would also appear on Parker&#x27;s Vest Pocket models, for being attached to a watch fob. Matching pencils would come with either clip or ring, depending on the pen selected. The pen was available only in black and red hard rubber until 1926, when Parker introduced the “unbreakable Permanite” Duofold (Permanite was Parker’s trade name for a plastic manufactured by DuPont). The first new hue was the now traditional red, followed by Jade green (made to compete with Sheaffer&#x27;s revolutionary Jade Radite Lifetime pens) which was not originally referred to as a Duofold, but rather the Black Tipped Jade (changed shortly thereafter). This was followed by Lapis Lazuli blue and Mandarin Yellow. In 1928, Moderne black and pearl (black lined pearl) was introduced as a Deluxe model and Parker signified this by the addition of a third cap ring to the cap band instead of the usual two found at the time. In 1930 the Duofold line was streamlined with tapered ends replacing the familiar “flat-top” style. Additional varieties were introduced: burgundy (red and black pearl); Moderne green and pearl (green lined pearl); and finally, green and black pearl (black lined green pearl).

But by the early 1930s the Duofold’s design was viewed by the manufacturer as rather outmoded. Parker launched its replacement, the Vacumatic, in 1933, and the Duofold line was moved to second tier, even though it followed closely the Vacumatic&#x27;s design with slimmer profile, streamlined look and vacumatic filling mechanism. Duofolds remained popular in Europe, being produced well into the 1960s in varying sizes and shades, and were revived in the 1980s as Parker&#x27;s flagship offering once more. In 1988 (to celebrate the company&#x27;s centennial), Parker launched the Duofold Centennial series of Pens (Fountain Pens, Rollerballs and Pencils). Later, they introduced the Duofold International line with models that also evoked the classic Duofold design, though smaller than the Centennial. There are also differences in the ink feeding systems, changing from their Button Filling mechanism to a cartridge/converter system.

<doc id="751060" wikidata="Q297047" url="?curid=751060" title="Yermak Timofeyevich">
<text>Yermak Timofeyevich (, ; 1532 (supposedly) – August 5 or 6, 1585) was a Cossack ataman who started the Russian conquest of Siberia during the reign of the Russian tsar Ivan the Terrible. He is today a hero in Russian folklore and myths.

Russian interests in the fur trade fueled their desire to expand east into Siberia. The Tatar Khanate of Kazan established by Ulugh Muhammad was the best entryway into Siberia. In 1552, Ivan the Terrible&#x27;s modernized army toppled the khanate. After the takeover of Kazan, the tsar looked to the powerful and affluent Stroganov merchant family to spearhead the eastward expansion. In the late 1570s, the Stroganovs recruited Cossack fighters to invade Asia on behalf of the tsar. These Cossacks elected Yermak as the leader of their armed forces, and in 1582 Yermak set out with an army of 840 to attack the Khanate of Sibir.

On October 26, 1582, Yermak and his soldiers overthrew Kuchum Khan&#x27;s Tatar empire at Qashliq in a battle that marked the &quot;conquest of Siberia&quot;. Yermak remained in Siberia and continued his struggle against the Tatars until 1584, when a raid organized by Kuchum Khan ambushed and killed him and his party.

The specifics of Yermak&#x27;s life, such as his appearance, background, and dates of events, remain points of controversy for historians, because the texts that document his life are not reliable. However, his life and conquests had a profound influence on Siberian relations, sparking Russian interest in the region and establishing the Tsardom of Russia as an imperial power east of the Urals.

==Authenticity==
There is less information about Yermak than most other notable explorers and historical figures. Much of what we know about Yermak is derived from folklore and legend. There are no contemporary descriptions of Yermak and all portraits are merely estimations. One of the Siberian chronicles, the &quot;Remezov Chronicle&quot;, written more than one hundred years after Yermak&#x27;s death describes him as &quot;flat-faced, black of beard with curly hair, of medium stature and thick-set and broad-shouldered,&quot; but even this detailed account is not reliable because the narrator had never seen Yermak.

In addition to his physical features&#x27; being unknown, the details of Yermak&#x27;s life and the circumstances leading up to his excursion into Siberia are obscure. Russian writer Valentin Rasputin laments the lack of information that we have about Yermak considering the vast scope of his contributions to Russian society. 

Knowledge of Yermak&#x27;s upbringing and voyages pales in comparison to that of other explorers. Historians encounter serious difficulties when attempting to piece together the specifics of Yermak&#x27;s life and exploits because the two key, primary sources about Yermak may be biased or inaccurate. These sources are the &quot;Stroganov Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;Sinodnik&quot;. The &quot;Stroganov Chronicle&quot; was commissioned by the Stroganov family itself, therefore it exaggerates the family&#x27;s involvement in the conquest of Siberia. The Sinodnik is an account of Yermak&#x27;s campaign written forty years after his death by the archbishop of Tobolsk, Cyprian (Kipriyan). The text was formed based on oral tradition and memories of his expedition but almost certainly was affected by the archbishop&#x27;s desire to canonize Yermak. The combination of forgotten details over time and the embellishment or omission of facts in order for Yermak to be accepted as a saint suggests that the &quot;Sinodik&quot; could be erroneous. Though Cyprian failed to canonize Yermak, he made an effort to immortalize the warrior, who he considered being the &quot;Grand Inquisitor&quot; of Siberia.

These documents, along with the various others that chronicle Yermak&#x27;s expeditions, are filled with contradictions that make the truth about Yermak&#x27;s life difficult to discern. While the sources that exist on Yermak are fallible, those accounts, along with folklore and legend, are all that historians have to base their knowledge on; therefore, they are widely accepted and considered to reflect the truth.

==Early life==

===Ancestry===
The Don Cossack warrior Yermak Timofeyevich was born by the Chusovaya River on the eastern fringes of the Muscovite lands. The only information about Yermak&#x27;s upbringing comes from a source called the &quot;Cherepanov Chronicle&quot;. This chronicle, compiled by a Tobolsk coachman in 1760 – long after Yermak&#x27;s death – was never published in full, but, in 1894, historian Aleksandr Alekseyevich Dmitriyev concluded it probably represents a copy or paraphrase of an authentic 17th-century document. According to the section of the chronicle entitled &quot;On Yermak, and where he was born&quot;, it is stated that Yermak&#x27;s grandfather, Afonasiy Grigoryevich Alenin, came from Suzdal, north-east of Moscow. 

To escape poverty, he moved south to Vladimir where he became a coachman in the Murom forests. In the Murom forests, the voyevoda arrested him for driving unscrupulous passengers – robbers who had hired him. Afonasiy&#x27;s son (Yermak&#x27;s father) Timofey relocated to the Stroganov lands on the Chusovaya in order to make money.

===Occupation===
Yermak worked in the Stroganovs&#x27; river fleet as a porter and a sailor transporting salt along the Kama and the Volga rivers. Growing tired of his work, he assembled a gang, left his employment, and moved to the Don region to become a river pirate. Among his fellow Cossack bandits, he acquired the nickname Yermak.

Prior to his conquest of Siberia, Yermak&#x27;s combat experience consisted of leading a Cossack detachment for the tsar in the Livonian War of 1558–83 and plundering merchant ships. Based on legends and folk songs, for years, Yermak had been involved in robbing and plundering on the Volga with the hetman Ivan Kolzo and four other Cossack leaders. Historian Valerie Kivelson refers to Yermak&#x27;s group as &quot;his gang of thugs.&quot; Like many other Cossacks, Yermak&#x27;s gang was involved in the &quot;thieves&quot; trade (&quot;&quot;vorovskim&quot; remeslom&quot;). It was typical of Cossacks to engage in piracy on the Sea of Azov or the Caspian Sea and to rob various envoys and Russian or Persian merchants. Though a bandit, Yermak earned a reputation as an eminent and loyal Russian fighter. Through his experience fighting in the Livonian War, he learned war tactics and excelled beyond the other hetmans in skill.

==Conquest background==

In the late 1500s, prior to Yermak&#x27;s expeditions, the Russians attempted to push eastward into Siberia in search of furs. Under Ivan the Great, the Russians entered northwest Siberia but &quot;to approach Siberia from that direction proved too arduous and difficult, even in the best of times.&quot; The Russians decided that taking a southern route through the Tatar khanate of Kazan would allow them to penetrate Siberia more easily, but Kazan would need to be overthrown first. Ivan the Terrible&#x27;s first foreign objective upon rising to power was to take Kazan. Ivan the Terrible&#x27;s modernized army proved successful at the beginning of October 1552 and Ivan proceeded to open up the east to enterprising Russian individuals, such as the Stroganovs. Anika Stroganov used the former khanate of Kazan as an entryway into Siberia and established a private empire on the southwest corner of Siberia.

Following the Russian conquest under Ivan the Terrible, the Tatar khanate of Kazan became the Russian province of Perm. Ivan the Terrible had tremendous trust in the entrepreneurial prowess of the Stroganov family and granted them the province of Perm as a financial investment which would be sure to benefit Russia in the future. The tsar also gave the Stroganovs permission to expand into the territory along the Tobol and Irtysh Rivers which belonged to the Muslim leader Kuchum Khan. The Stroganovs proceeded to launch expeditions eastward into non-Russian territories. They pushed into the khanate of Sibir, the sister state of the former khanate of Kazan, because it maintained control over Siberia&#x27;s fur in the west.

During the time of the Russian conquest of Kazan in the 1540s and 1550s, Sibir had been undergoing conflicts of its own with rival clans. The khanate was on the precarious ground until the rise of Kuchum Khan, a descendant of the famed Chingis Khan, in the 1560s. Kuchum Khan built up allies among his neighbors and the Crimean Tatars in order to thwart the Stroganovs&#x27; expansion across the Urals. In July 1572, Kuchum launched his first raid on Stroganov settlements, which resulted in almost one hundred deaths. In 1573, the Tatar army expanded and changed leadership. Kuchum&#x27;s nephew, Mahmet-kul, assumed control of the Tatar army. The Stroganovs realized that they could no longer expect their settlers to remain in the lands around Perm if they only fought a defensive battle. The tsar granted the Stroganov family permission to invade Asia. However, the tsar soon changed his mind and told the Stroganovs to retract from Siberia, fearing that Russia did not have the resources or manpower to topple Kuchum Khan&#x27;s empire.

The Stroganovs decided to ignore the tsar&#x27;s orders and, in the late 1570s, Anika Stroganov&#x27;s grandsons Nikita and Maksim recruited Cossack fighters to wage war on their behalf. They elected the Cossack chieftain Yermak Timofeyevich as the leader of the Cossack brigades. According to the Stroganov Chronicle, on April 6, 1579, after hearing of Yermak&#x27;s and his comrades&#x27; &quot;daring and bravery,&quot; the Stroganovs sent a letter to the men asking them to come to their ancestral estates in Chusovaya and summoning them to fight against the Tatars in the name of the tsar. Since Yermak had been the most illustrious of the recruits, he became the captain (ataman) of the &quot;conquest of Siberia.&quot; However, there remains the question as to whether Yermak, in fact, decided to fight the war of his own accord without being pursued by the Stroganovs. This question arose due to the discrepancy between the narratives of the Stroganov Chronicle and a different Siberian chronicle, the Yespiov Chronicle. The Stroganov Chronicle portrays the family as the motivating force behind Yermak&#x27;s campaign while the Yesipov Chronicle fails even to mention the family. Perhaps the Stroganovs told the story in a way that would inspire the Russian people to feel just as indebted to them as to Yermak for the conquest of Siberia. Siberian historians are divided on the matter, some believing that the Stroganovs were behind Yermak&#x27;s campaign and others believing that they played no part in it.

==Conquest of Siberia==
Yermak was officially enlisted by the Stroganovs in the spring of 1582. His quest was &quot;to take de facto possession of the country along the Tobol and the Irtysh, which was already de jure in the Stroganovs&#x27; possession under the Tsar&#x27;s charter of 1574.&quot; The Stroganovs&#x27; ultimate goal was to open up a southern passageway to Mangaseya to access its furs. The Khanate of Sibir blocked the road from the Urals to Mangaseya. After overthrowing the khanate, the intended final destination of Yermak&#x27;s five thousand mile journey was the Bering Strait. Yermak led a small army of 840 men, made up of 540 of his own followers and three hundred supplied by the Stroganovs. His army was composed of &quot;Russians, Tatars, Lithuanians, and Germans.&quot; The Lithuanians and Germans of the crew came from the Lithuanian front. Nikita and Maksim Stroganov spent twenty thousand rubles of their riches to outfit the army with the best weapons available. This was especially to the advantage of the Russian detachment because their Tatar opponents did not have industrial weapons. According to Russian history specialist W. Bruce Lincoln, the Tatars&#x27; &quot;bows, arrows, and spears&quot; went up against Yermak&#x27;s team&#x27;s &quot;matchlock muskets, sabers, pikes, and several small cannons.&quot; However, according to the Russian author Yuri Semyonov, &quot;Yermak had no cannon, and only a small number of his men carried firearms. The Cossacks had not a single horse, while Kuchum and his men were mounted. His cavalry could move quickly in any direction, while the Cossacks were tied to their rafts, which were laden with all their supplies.&quot;

Yermak first embarked on his journey through Siberia from a frontier fort in Perm on the Chusovaya River on September 1, 1582, though other sources claim that he may have started his campaign in 1579 or 1581. When navigating down rivers, the crew used high-sided boats that originated in Russia. Throughout their journey, they encountered violent opposition from Kuchum Khan&#x27;s native allies but the high sides of their boats acted as shields. When crossing the Urals, the Cossacks had to carry their possessions on their backs because they did not have horses. After two months, Yermak&#x27;s army had finally crossed the Urals. They followed the river Tura and found themselves at the outskirts of Kuchum Khan&#x27;s empire. Soon they reached the kingdom&#x27;s capital city of Qashliq. On October 23, 1582, Yermak&#x27;s army fought the Battle of Chuvash Cape, which initiated three days of fighting against Kuchum&#x27;s nephew, Mehmet-kul, and the Tatar army. Yermak&#x27;s infantry blocked the Tatar charge with mass musket fire, which wounded Mahmet-kul and prevented the Tatars from scoring a single Russian casualty. Yermak succeeded in capturing Qashliq and the battle came to mark the &quot;conquest of Siberia.&quot; The Stroganov Chronicle provides an account of Kuchum Khan&#x27;s reaction to the attack on Qashliq and Yermak&#x27;s success:

Khan Kuchyum, seeing his ruin and the loss of his kingdom and riches, said to all his men with bitter lamentation: &#x27;O murzas and princes, let us flee without delaying…The Stroganovs sent men of the common people against me from their forts to avenge on me the evil I had inflicted; they sent the atamans and Cossacks, Yermak and his comrades, with not many of their men. He came upon us, defeated us and did us such great harm.&#x27;
While Yermak had succeeded in taking Qashliq, the battle had reduced his Cossack force to 500 men. Yermak also now faced a supply problem. While the army had found treasures such as fur, silk, and gold in the Tatar city, no food or provisions had been left behind. The inhabitants had also fled the city, preventing their enlistment for aid. However, four days after Yermak claimed Qashliq the people returned, and Yermak soon befriended the Ostyak people. The Ostyaks would formally declare their allegiance to Yermak on October 30, complementing their pledge by delivering offerings of food to the city. 

Yermak used the Ostyak tributes to feed his band of Cossacks throughout the winter. However, these supplies proved to be insufficient, and the Cossacks soon ventured into the wilderness to fish and hunt. The Cossacks&#x27; task was not without trouble, as although Yermak had defeated the Tatars they continued to harass the Cossacks, preventing Yermak from establishing complete control over the region. The Tatars struck a decisive blow on December 20, when a Cossack party of twenty men were discovered and slain. Upon their failure to return, Yermak left the city to investigate, eventually finding that Mahmet-kul had recovered from their earlier battle and was responsible for the Cossacks&#x27; murder. Yermak then entered into battle with Mahmet-kul and his forces, defeating him once again.

The defeat of Mahmet-kul provided a brief respite to the Cossacks. However, in April 1583, he returned to the region. In an unfortunate twist of fate, Mahmet-kul was quickly ambushed and captured by a small party of Cossacks, whose numbers ranged from as little as 10 to as many as 50. A few days after his capture, Mahmet-kul sent a messenger to Kuchum stating that he was alive and in good health. He also requested that the Khan cease attacks on the Cossacks and those bringing tribute to Yermak. Yermak, taking advantage of this lull in hostilities, set out down the Irtysh and Ob to complete his subjugation of the local tribal princes. He soon encountered the Ostyak prince Demian, who had fortified himself in a fortress on the banks of the Irtysh with 2,000 loyal fighters. It is reported to have taken Yermak and his men considerable time to break through their defenses due to Demian&#x27;s possession of a gilded idol. Yermak&#x27;s forces eventually prevailed; however, upon entering the fort, no idol was found. After dispersing a group of priests and warriors by brandishing their firearms, Yermak determined to subdue the most influential Ostyak prince of the region, Samar, who had joined forces with eight other princes. Yermak, noting that Samar had failed to place guards around his encampment, launched a surprise attack, killing Samar and disbanding his forces. Yermak was then able to secure tribute from the eight other princes. After this conquest, he continued down the river, succeeding in capturing the key Ostyak town of Nazym. Yermak&#x27;s friend, Ataman Nikita Pan, and several Cossacks lost their lives in the battle. Yermak then directed his forces down the river Ob, conquering several small forts. After reaching a point at which the river broadened to a point of three or four versts, Yermak halted the expedition and returned his forces to Qashliq.

Upon returning to Qashliq, Yermak decided to inform the Stroganovs and the tsar of his conquests. While his reasons for this are unclear, experts believe that, in addition to wishing to clear his name of earlier misdeeds, Yermak also desperately needed supplies. To his end, he sent his trusted lieutenant Ivan Kolzo with fifty men, two letters (one each for the Stroganovs and Ivan the Terrible), and a large assortment of furs for the tsar. The exact amount sent to the tsar is disputed, as descriptions range from 2,500 to 5,000 to sixty sacks of furs. Kozo&#x27;s arrival at the Stroganovs was well-timed, as Maksim Stroganov had just received a letter from Ivan denouncing Yermak and threatening him and his followers with death. Kolzo, bearing news of Kuchum&#x27;s defeat, Mahmet-kul&#x27;s capture, and the subjugation of Tatar lands, was thus well received by a relieved Maksim. Maksim provided Kolzo with lodging, food, and money before sending him on his way.

Kolzo, upon reaching Moscow, was granted an audience with Ivan despite having a Muscovite bounty on his head. To the detriment of Moscow&#x27;s interests, the Livonian War had just been ended and Ivan had begun receiving reports of local tribesman conducting raids in Perm, putting him in a foul mood. Upon reading the news born by Kolzo concerning the extension of his dominion, Ivan became overjoyed, immediately pardoning the Cossacks and proclaiming Yermak to be a hero of the first degree. The triumphant atmosphere extended across the city, as church bells were tolled throughout Moscow to glorify Yermak. Ivan then had many gifts prepared for Yermak, including his personal fur mantle, a goblet, two suits of armor emblazoned with bronze double-headed eagles, and money. Ivan also commanded that a band of &quot;streltsy&quot; be sent to reinforce Yermak. Reports differ on whether 300 or 500 men were sent. The Stroganovs were also ordered to support this group with an additional fifty men upon their arrival in Perm. Yermak was bestowed the title &quot;Prince of Siberia&quot; by Ivan, who also commanded that Mahmet-kul be sent to Moscow.

Upon returning to Qashliq, Kolzo informed Yermak of the tsar&#x27;s command that Mahmet-kul be delivered to him. Yermak, aware that doing so would eliminate Kuchum&#x27;s only motive for peace, nonetheless obeyed the tsar and arranged for his transport. Unsurprisingly, Kuchum&#x27;s forces began to increase the frequency of their raids. Yermak now found himself in a predicament, as a long winter had prevented the gathering of supplies and tributes and the tsar&#x27;s reinforcements had not yet arrived. Under orders from the tsar, the Stroganovs had contributed fifty cavalries to the reinforcement party. However, the horses had slowed the party to a crawl across the Siberia landscape, and they did not even cross the Urals until the spring of 1584.

In September 1583, a call for help from a Tatar leader named Karacha was delivered to Yermak begging for assistance against the Nogai Tatars. Yermak, wary of Karacha but nonetheless disposed to help, deployed Kolzo with a force of 40 Cossacks. Karacha, however, was not to be trusted, as Kolzo and his men walked into an ambush and were all killed. Now without Kolzo, Yermak was left with a little more than 300 men. Sensing Yermak&#x27;s waning power, the tribes previously under his control revolted, and Qashliq soon came under siege by a collective army of Tatars, Voguls, and Ostyaks. Cleverly, they encircled the city with a line of wagons, both preventing passage to and from the city while protecting the attackers from the Russians&#x27; firearms. Yermak, despite having limited supplies, was able to endure the blockade for three months. However, the Cossacks could not last forever, and on the cloudy night of June 12, 1584, Yermak decided to act. Stealthily penetrating the line of wagons, Yermak&#x27;s men were able to surprise the gathered forces in their sleep, killing a large number. As Karacha&#x27;s forces had been caught completely unaware, Yermak was able to recover a substantial amount of provisions from the barricade. Karacha, having failed in his mission, was punished by Kuchum, who sentenced Karacha&#x27;s two sons to death. Karacha, fueled by the loss of his sons, regrouped the native tribes and returned to assault Yermak the next day. Karacha&#x27;s forces, however, were soundly defeated, as the Cossacks were able to kill one hundred men with only two dozen deaths of their own.

Defeated and disgraced, Karacha fled south to the steppes of the Ishim, where Kuchum waited. Freed from confinement, Yermak turned to the offensive, conquering many towns and forts to the east of Qashliq and extending the tsar&#x27;s dominion. Having already regained the loyalty of the revolting tribes, Yermak continued sailing up the Irtysh throughout the summer of 1584 to subdue tribes and demand tribute. Although he attempted to search for Karacha, Yermak was ultimately unsuccessful in this venture. Also, while Yermak had succeeded in regaining the loyalty of the tribes, his men were now almost completely out of gunpowder. To make matters worse, while his reinforcements arrived, they did so utterly exhausted and depleted by scurvy. Indeed, many of the men, including their commanding officer, had not survived the journey. Thus, in addition to facing the problem of escalating hostilities, their food shortage was magnified by the arrival of more men. Eventually, it is reported the situation grew dire enough that Yermak&#x27;s men turned to cannibalism, eating the bodies of the deceased.

==Yermak&#x27;s death==
The precise details of Yermak&#x27;s death are lost to history, but legend has preserved multiple variations of the account. With the onset and worsening of the food shortage, Yermak&#x27;s people had now entered a time of famine. Kuchum, knowing this, set a trap. The most common account is that Kuchum purposely leaked information to Yermak, in which it was claimed that Bukharan merchants from Central Asia, traveling with large amounts of food, were being prevented from moving by Kuchum&#x27;s men. In August 1584, Yermak set out with a band of men to free the traders. Finding the reports to be false, Yermak ordered a return to Qashliq. Whether because of an ongoing storm or because the men were tired from rowing upstream, Yermak&#x27;s force stopped on a small island formed by two branches of the Irtysh and set up camp on the night of August 4–5, 1584. Convinced that the river offered protection, Yermak&#x27;s men fell asleep with no guard. Kuchum, however, had been following Yermak&#x27;s party and was lying in wait. Kuchum&#x27;s forces forded the river around midnight; their approach was hidden by the loudness of the storm and the dark of night. Kuchum&#x27;s Tatars were upon Yermak&#x27;s men so quickly that they could not use either their guns or weapons, and a slaughter ensued. In the ensuing chaos, it is reported that all but three men on the Russian side were killed, including Yermak. Legend has it that after fighting through the invaders and being wounded in the arm by a knife, Yermak, finding that their boats had been washed away in the storm, attempted to cross the river. Due to the weight of the armor gifted to him by the Tsar, Yermak sank to the bottom and drowned. At least one survivor, unburdened by such heavy armor, was able to flee across the river and return to Qashliq with news of Yermak&#x27;s death.

Yermak&#x27;s body was borne down the river, where seven days later it is said to have been found by a Tatar fisherman named Yanish. Easily recognizable by the eagle on his armor, Yermak&#x27;s corpse was stripped and hung on a frame made out of six poles, where for six weeks archers used his body for target practice. However, it is said that animals did not feed on him and his body produced no odor and that the corpse caused fear and nightmares in the people. Heeding these omens, the Tatars buried him as a hero, killing thirty oxen in his name. His prized armor was eventually distributed among the Tatar chiefs.

==Legacy==
Upon receiving news of Yermak&#x27;s death, the Cossacks became immediately demoralized. The original band of men had dwindled to 150 fighters, and command now fell to Glukhoff, the leader of the initial group of reinforcements that the tsar had delivered to Yermak. The Cossacks soon decided to abandon Qashliq and to retreat to Russia. Before traveling a great distance, they ran into a group of one hundred reinforcements that had been sent as additional strength from the tsar. With this upturn in fortune, Yermak&#x27;s band resolved to return to Qashliq and refortify their position in accordance with the tsar&#x27;s will. The fast-acting and perceptive Tatars, however, had been informed of the group&#x27;s flight and had retaken the city almost immediately, preventing any peaceful reoccupation of their former stronghold. Although the Tatar position appeared strong, they were no longer led by Kuchum, who had lost his power, and were thus not as stable as before. Furthermore, another three hundred reinforcements from the tsar soon arrived to join the Russians. Led by Tchulkoff, this new force provided a significant boost in fighting strength to the party. Despite the tumultuous state of the Tatar leadership and their newly received recruits, however, the Russians did not pursue another attempt on Qashliq. Instead, in a culmination of the events immediately following Yermak&#x27;s fatal plunge, they founded a new settlement in 1587 on the site of what would become Tobolsk, a comfortable twelve miles from Qashliq. Although the Tatars quickly began raids against their familiar foe, after a short period they ceased, leaving the Russians to their new town.

Yermak&#x27;s heroic endeavors in the Russian East laid the groundwork for future Russian expansion and settlement. Soon after Yermak and his initial band set out for Siberia, merchants and peasants followed in their wake, hoping to harness some of the fur riches that abounded in the land. This trend grew exponentially after Yermak&#x27;s death, as his legend spread through the domain rapidly and, with it, the news of a land rich in furs and vulnerable to Russian influence. Colonization attempts soon followed, as Tyumen, the first known town after Yermak&#x27;s death, was founded in 1586. The settling of this territory facilitated the establishment and development of Siberian agriculture. Most of these farmers were, in fact, soldiers, who grew their own sustenance out of necessity.

Yermak had set a precedent of Cossack involvement in Siberian expansion, and the exploration and conquests of these men were responsible for many of the additions to the Russian empire in the east. After the initial return of the Cossacks shortly after Yermak&#x27;s death, an ambitious project of fortification began under the direction of Tsar Boris Godunov. Its achievements, including the extension of protection for Russians in the region, would drive even greater numbers of entrepreneurs to Siberia. In 1590, Tobolsk received a significant boost in prominence as it was dubbed the principal city and administrative center of the region. The fur trade also continued to grow, aided by the Cossacks, who in 1593 established the trading center of Berezof on the Ob River at the sixty-fourth latitude. The practice of collecting tributes of fur from the natives continued to spread, and in the 17th century such furs made up 25–33 percent of the income to the tsar&#x27;s treasury. Thus, as soon as fifteen years after Yermak&#x27;s death, the basin of the Ob River had truly become a region of Russian influence. Even so, the Russians did not rest on their laurels, and the attitude and pace of expansion pioneered by Yermak continued well into the 17th century. Indeed, within the first half of the century the fort of Yeniseysk was established in 1619, the city of Yakutsk founded in 1632, and the important feat of reaching the Sea of Okhotsk on the Pacific coast in 1639. Throughout these campaigns, Yermak&#x27;s influence was undeniable, as the pace he had established for achievement in his relatively short time in Siberia heralded a new age of Russian pioneering.

Yermak&#x27;s life and conquests had a significant impact on Russian policy towards Siberia and the colonization attempts that followed this shift. Prior to Yermak&#x27;s agreement with the Strogonovs, the Russian attitude towards the Siberian expanse had been one preoccupied primarily with defense, not aggression. The top priority was the repelling of the Tatar hordes, and, as shown by Ivan&#x27;s letter to the Strogonovs, the central government rarely involved itself unless the tribes succeeded in entering Russian territory. This, of course, changed with Yermak, whose triumphs showed that the Tatars could be put on the defensive and that Russia could now establish itself as an aggressive power in the East. Yermak also changed the involvement of the tsar in Siberian affairs. In reaching out to the tsar for assistance, Yermak gained the support of the government; indeed, it was reinforcements from the tsar that solidified the Russian presence in the region immediately after Yermak&#x27;s death. This newfound commitment and involvement in the area is best summarized by Ivan&#x27;s acceptance of the title bestowed upon him by Yermak: &quot;Tsar of Sibir.&quot; Yermak&#x27;s pioneering further enabled this system to exist because it depended on the success he achieved in gaining tribute from conquered peoples. Much like Yermak, future troops were sent with the understanding that it would be necessary to supplement their base payment with treasures and tributes gained from conquest. Without this system in place, it is unlikely such an arrangement would have come to fruition.

Future explorers would also take notice of Yermak&#x27;s strategy in approaching the Siberian lands, which, unlike those in many other colonization attempts, already had an established imperial power. However, Yermak wisely recognized that Kuchum&#x27;s territories were not unified. Yermak noted that many of these peoples were nothing more than vassals and that they were quite diverse in terms of race, language, and religion. Unlike Kuchum and his Mohammedan Tatars, many of these groups were pagan. Due to the sum of these differences, many simply paid tribute to avoid trouble, and it mattered little to whom the tribute was paid. Yermak&#x27;s unique strength was thus in recognizing the bigger picture and playing it to his advantage, first identifying and then executing quick, efficient ways to establish influence in the region.

The actions of Yermak also redefined the meaning of the word Cossack. While it is uncertain whether Yermak&#x27;s group was related in any way to the Yaik or Ural Cossacks, it is known that their company was previously outlawed by the Russian government. However, in sending his letter and his trusted lieutenant Ivan Kolzo to Ivan the Terrible, Yermak transformed the image of the Cossack overnight from a bandit to a soldier recognized by the Tsar of Moscow. Now, Yermak&#x27;s Cossacks had effectively been incorporated into the military system and were able to receive support from the tsar. This new arrangement also acted as a sort of pressure-relief valve for the Cossacks, who had a history of being troublesome on the Russian frontier. In sending as many of them as possible further east into unconquered lands, the burgeoning and extremely profitable lands on the borders of Russian territory were given respite. Yermak&#x27;s call for aid thus spawned a new type of Cossack which, by virtue of its link to the government, would enjoy significant favor from future Russian rulers. Despite this new shift in orientation, it is worth noting that the Cossack name remained in place in Siberia and that soldiers sent as reinforcements often adopted this title. Furthermore, this realignment was not without criticism, however, and some saw Yermak as a traitor to the Cossack name. Such detractors saw Yermak&#x27;s death as punishment for turning away from the Cossack code and becoming a pawn of the tsar. Fittingly, then, it was his armor, the very symbol of the tsar, that dragged him down to his fate.

Relics of Yermak also continued to command significant power and prestige years after his death. In particular, the search for his armor affected at least one element of Siberian relations. Decades after Yermak&#x27;s death, a Mongol leader who had assisted the Russian government approached the voyevoda of Tobolsk and asked for his assistance in obtaining an item in the Tatar&#x27;s possession, believed to be Yermak&#x27;s armor. The reason he approached the voyevoda was that he had previously been denied a trade by the Tatars after offering them ten slave families and a thousand sheep. The Tatars, despite being convinced that the armor had divine properties, agreed to the sale upon the involvement of the voyevoda. Soon after, the Mongol, convinced of the power of Yermak&#x27;s armor, refused to service the Russian government because he no longer feared their might.

==Commemoration== 

Multiple statues and monuments have been erected in his honor throughout Russia. V. A. Beklemishev began his construction project for a monument dedicated to Yermak in 1903 in the Cathedral Square of Novocherkassk, the capital of the Don Cossack country. On the monument Yermak is shown holding his regimental banner in his left hand and the ceremonial cap of his rival Kuchum Khan in his right hand. The back of the monument reads: &quot;To the Don Cossack Ataman Ermak Timofeyevich, the Siberia conqueror from the grateful posterity. In honor of Don Cossack Army 300th Anniversary. He passed away in Irtysh waves on August 5, 1584.&quot; Some believe that Yermak was born in the village of Kachalinskaya on the Don. Though this region has long claimed Yermak to be one of its own, there is no evidence that he was born there or ever visited.There is also a statue of Yermak at Tobolsk and one in the State Russian Museum in Saint Petersburg designed by Mark Antokolsky.

Two icebreakers have been named after Yermak. The first, built in Newcastle, England, in 1898, was one of the first major vessels of that type ever built and the second, which entered the service in 1974, was the first of an impressive new type of ship.

In commemoration of Yermak, there is a town named after him on the upper Irtysh. Similarly, a mountain in the Perm Region made up of three cliff stacks is called the Yermak Stone after Yermak. Legend has it that Yermak and his brigade passed one of the harsh Siberian winters on the cliff side.

==In popular culture==
===Film===
Yermak makes an appearance in the 1947 film &quot;Tale of the Siberian Land&quot; (&quot;Skazanie o zemle sibirskoi&quot;) directed by Ivan Pyryev. The movie tells the story of a pianist named Andrei who moves to Siberia to work at a paper-processing plant after being wounded in World War II and losing his faith in music. Once in Siberia, Andrei reunites with a female singer with whom he had been in love in Moscow. When nothing comes of their second encounter, he heads far north in Siberia and becomes so enamored with the might of Soviet construction projects that he composes a choral symphony entitled the &#x27;Tale of Siberian Land.&#x27; Andrei is then reunited with his beloved who finds him in the depths of Siberia. The two travel to Moscow where Andrei&#x27;s symphony is performed in the Conservatory. The symphony tells his life story while presenting the &quot;mysterious, wild, silver grey&quot; landscape of Siberia to the audience. In displaying the &quot;extreme might of the land,&quot; he conveys &quot;the extreme heroism of the Russian and Soviet conquest of Siberia.&quot; The symphony introduces Yermak as a mighty figure who &quot;made his way through the fog and mist to do battle with Siberia.&quot;
The film then begins a visual montage which traces Russian history and the representation of the Russian landscape over time. Yermak is shown as a &quot;pantomime hero&quot; leading his forces into battle. Simon Franklin and Emma Widdis describe that &quot;here, the director taps into the folk imagination and the landscape that he evokes is plainly the landscape of the epic. As the battle ends, the natural world itself expresses the majesty of Yermak&#x27;s achievement. Fire turns into lightning, and then the rain begins: the conquest of the elements is complete, as nature bows down in the face of Russian strength, and Siberia is conquered.&quot; The montage then shifts to show the landscape as softer, flatter, and gentler. Andrei proceeds to describe the process through which Yermak&#x27;s descendants continued to dominate Siberia. Ultimately, Yermak is portrayed as the hero who launched the conquest that shaped the whole of Russia.

In 1996, directors Vladimir Krasnopolsky and Valeri Uskov produced the film &quot;Yermak&quot;, a historical drama about the conquest of Siberia which starred Viktor Stepanov, Irina Alfyorova, and Nikita Dzhigurda.

===Folk songs and poetry===
There are many folk songs and much poetry about Yermak which contribute to our vision of the hero. By tracing the transformation of folk songs and poetry about Yermak since his death, it is possible to see how his status as a legendary figure has evolved over time.

Over 150 songs about Yermak&#x27;s exploits have been collected and spread throughout all of Russia since the 18th century. As many as 35 of these songs have been collected in a text by V. Th. Miller entitled &quot;Historical Songs of the Russian People of the XVI-XVII Centuries.&quot; One song describes how &quot;Yermak&#x27;s men kill the Muscovite ambassador to Persia named as Semen Konstantinovich Karamyshev&quot; while others speak of Yermak&#x27;s acts of piracy and pillaging with his Cossack brigade. Though most folk songs are not entirely consistent with the historical accounts of Yermak&#x27;s life, there are many similarities and much overlap among the different songs. There are often several versions of the same song that share certain details but differ on others.

I. I. Dmitriyev (1760–1837) wrote the dramatic poem &quot;Yermak&quot; and K. P. Ryleyev (1795–1826) in 1821 wrote a poem entitled &quot;The death of Yermak.&quot;

<text>USS &quot;A. Houghton&quot; – a 326 ton bark – was purchased during the beginning of the American Civil War by the Union Navy.

&quot;A. Houghton&quot; served throughout the war against the Confederate States of America as an ammunition ship, supporting the Union fleet. Towards the end of the war, she served as a storeship and as a health ship whose task it was to restore post-operative wounded personnel back to health.

==Built in Maine in 1852==
&quot;A. Houghton&quot; – a bark built in 1852 by James P. Rideout at Robbinston, Maine – was purchased by the Navy on 12 October 1861 at New York City and – after being fitted out at the New York Navy Yard – was placed in commission on 19 February 1862.

==Civil War service==
===Assigned to the West Gulf blockade===
Nine days before, on 10 February, the bark was slated for duty in the Mortar Flotilla of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. That bombardment group, led by Commander David Dixon Porter, was being established to provide covering fire for Flag Officer David Farragut during his forthcoming campaign against New Orleans, Louisiana.
Soon after being commissioned, the bark departed New York Harbor and proceeded via Key West, Florida, and Ship Island, Mississippi, to the Mississippi Delta where she waited while Farragut and his squadron were laboring to get his deep-draft, oceangoing warships across the bar and into the river.

In mid-April, after this difficult task had been completed, she accompanied Porter&#x27;s mortar schooners upstream to a point a short distance below Forts Jackson and St. Philip, which guarded the river, approaches to New Orleans, Louisiana, from the sea. There, she supplied Porter&#x27;s guns with ammunition as they shelled the Confederate works during the days preceding the bold dash of Farragut&#x27;s steam-propelled men-of-war past the guns of the forts to capture New Orleans.

===New Orleans falls to Union forces===
After the great Southern metropolis fell, &quot;A. Houghton&quot; retired with the Flotilla to the Gulf of Mexico to await Farragut and join him in a planned attack on Mobile, Alabama. However, orders from Washington, D.C. directed Farragut to ascend the Mississippi River past the Confederate river fortress at Vicksburg, Mississippi, and join forces with Flag Officer Charles Henry Davis who had been fighting his way down the Mississippi River from its confluence with the Ohio River.

===Supporting the attack on Vicksburg===
Knowing the strength of the South&#x27;s position at Vicksburg, Farragut ordered Porter to bring the flotilla back to the Mississippi so that it might support him in operations against Vicksburg as it had done in his advance on New Orleans. &quot;A. Houghton&quot; accompanied the flotilla as it returned to the Mississippi and supported it late in June during its bombardment of Vicksburg&#x27;s batteries while Farragut&#x27;s ships ran the gauntlet through the fire of the Southern guns. Then, after descending the river to replenish her supply of ammunition, she left New Orleans on 3 July, towed back upstream by the merchant steamer &quot;Empire Parish&quot;.
On the 6th, while the two ships were passing Grand Gulf, Mississippi, Southern batteries fired upon them and scored several hits, wounding two men. However, &quot;A. Houghton&quot; immediately returned the fire to good effect. In later describing the action, Lieutenant George Henry Preble – who commanded Union gunboat which heard the firing and steamed downstream in the hope of assisting any embattled Northern forces – commented:

They thought the &quot;Houghton&quot; an unarmed transport, or would not have fired at her. For once they caught a tartar.

The bark&#x27;s fire knocked out one of the Southern guns and inflicted several casualties – both killed and wounded.

===Union difficulties in Virginia===
Meanwhile, events were taking place in Virginia, which would seriously weaken and ultimately disestablish the Mortar Flotilla. In a brilliant series of actions near Richmond, Virginia, – known to history as the Seven Days campaign – General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia turned back General George McClellan&#x27;s thrust against the Confederate capital and drove the battered Union troops of the Army of the Potomac into a precariously held position on the north bank of the James River called Harrison&#x27;s Landing.

To help protect McClellan&#x27;s beleaguered army, whose very existence was threatened, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles ordered a dozen of the schooners to leave the Mississippi River and to sail north to reinforce the James River Flotilla which was protecting McClellan&#x27;s flanks and keeping Lee&#x27;s victorious troops at bay.

===Reassigned to Pensacola, Florida===
&quot;A. Houghton&quot; was one of the small numbers of Porter&#x27;s vessels that remained in the West, but thereafter her role was changed. In mid-July, when a lack of ground forces to take and hold Vicksburg had convinced Farragut of the futility of his operations above Vicksburg, he again ran through the fire of the Southern guns and descended the river.

&quot;A. Houghton&quot; accompanied him downstream to New Orleans and then was sent to Pensacola, Florida, where she served as ammunition ship for the squadron until she sailed far north in the early autumn. She was decommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 12 October and remained there undergoing repairs until she was placed back in commission on 3 December 1862.
Then with her holds full of ammunition and other supplies, she once more sailed for the Gulf of Mexico and, by New Year&#x27;s Day 1863, was back at Pensacola supporting Farragut&#x27;s squadron.

===Reassigned to support to Atlantic blockade===
She remained on duty there until March 1863 when she sailed to New York City to load supplies for the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and served the ships of that organization – primarily at Hampton Roads, Virginia – into August when she entered the Norfolk Navy Yard and was decommissioned there on the 30th for repairs to her leaking hull.

The bark was recommissioned on 1 October 1863, but transferred to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She served at Port Royal, South Carolina – first as a supply vessel and then as a health ship – through the end of the Civil War.

==Post-war decommissioning==
After the South collapsed, she sailed north late in May 1865 and was decommissioned for the last time at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 9 June. She was sold at public auction there on 10 August. No facts concerning her subsequent career have been found.

<doc id="751063" wikidata="Q3523705" url="?curid=751063" title="Theodore Newton Vail">
<text>Theodore Newton Vail (July 16, 1845 – April 16, 1920) was an American businessman who served as the general manager of Bell Telephone Company from 1878 to 1887 and became the founding president of American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) in 1885. Vail viewed telephone service as a public utility and moved to consolidate telephone networks under the Bell system. In 1913, he oversaw the Kingsbury Commitment that led to a more open system for connection.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Theodore was born on July 16, 1845, in Malvern, Ohio, and was educated in Morristown, New Jersey. He initially studied medicine with his uncle. He also studied telegraphy. Success in telegraphy inspired him to go to New York City, where he became manager of a local telegraphy office. He then joined the staff of a superintendent of United States Telegraph, which ultimately became Western Union.

In 1866, Vail went west with his father to farm. In the fall of 1868, he was made operator and afterward agent at Pine Bluffs, Wyoming, on the Union Pacific Railroad. Pine Bluffs at that time was the principal supply point for wood for the Union Pacific, which had not then been completed.

In Spring 1869, Vail was appointed clerk of the railway mail service between Omaha, Nebraska, and Ogden, Utah. His success in getting the mail through during the snow blockage of 1870 drew the attention of upper management.

He was promoted to the Chicago and Iowa City railway post office, an important distribution point at the time. When the railway post office was established on the Union Pacific, Vail was promoted to head clerk.

In March 1873, Vail was assigned to duty in the office of the General Superintendent of Railway Mail Service in Washington, D.C., where he oversaw mail distribution and justified to Congress the compensation the railways received for carrying the mail. In June 1874, he was appointed Assistant Superintendent of Railway Mail Service. In 1875, he became Assistant General Superintendent.

In February 1876, Vail was appointed General Superintendent after his boss retired. He reached the highest grade attainable in this branch of the federal government and was the youngest officer in the Railway Mail Service, both in years and terms of service. When this final appointment was made by the Postmaster General, the Postmaster General said his only objection with Vail was his youth.

As General Superintendent, Vail helped place U.S. Postal employees under general civil service laws and established a system of six months&#x27; probationary appointments, which were subsequently adopted by all agencies.

===American Bell and AT&amp;T===
The American Bell Telephone Co. had been organized by Gardiner G. Hubbard, father in law of Alexander Graham Bell. As a lawyer and lobbyist, Hubbard had opposed the Post Office Department before Congress for a variety of reasons.

Vail became convinced as a result of his association with Hubbard that the telephone would eventually revolutionize world communication, and he became a vigorous, though generally unsuccessful, promoter of Bell stock.
Hubbard was impressed with Vail and offered him the position of general manager of the American Bell Telephone Company in 1878. Vail defended the Bell patents successfully from challenges from Western Union and others. He introduced the use of copper wire in telephone and telegraph lines.

===Personal life===
Vail was a first cousin to Alfred Vail, who was instrumental in developing the first telegraph.

In August 1869, Vail married Emma Righter (November 6, 1844 – February 3, 1905), of Newark, New Jersey. They had one son, Davis Righter Vail (July 18, 1870 – December 20, 1906), who died after a 10-day bout with typhoid fever in 1906.

Vail visited Vermont in 1883 and eventually purchased a farm in Lyndon, Vermont, Speedwell Farms, a site for conferences that culminated in the creation of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph.

Vail was a member of the Union League Club of New York, the Algonquin Club in Boston, and Jekyll Island Club.

===Later years and death===

In 1888, Vail retired but only temporarily as it turned out. He devoted his time to travel and adventure in South America, and promoting the use of the telephone abroad. In 1890, he received a concession from the federal government of Argentina to build a generating station at Cordoba to supply power to a trolley system in Buenos Aires. Vail had purchased a horse-drawn streetcar line serving the city and later bought out all competing lines and consolidated the system.

The Vail Mansion in Morristown, New Jersey, was built 1916–1918 as Vail&#x27;s residence. It was the Morristown Municipal Building for over 75 years and, as of 2023, is a condominium.

Vail died on April 16, 1920, at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. He had been brought to Baltimore from Jekyll Island, Georgia, in his personal rail car. Jekyll Island was a winter retreat for wealthy northern industrialists.

As a tribute to Vail, telephone service across the United States was halted for one minute on the morning of April 18, 1920, while his funeral was conducted in Parsippany, New Jersey. From 11:00 to 11:01, Eastern time (8:00 to 8:01 a.m. Pacific Time), AT&amp;T telephone operators disconnected calls. At the time, &quot;This caused temporary silence of about 12,000,000 telephones and 24,000,000 miles of telephone wire.&quot;

==Legacy==
In his historical review of AT&amp;T, John Brooks explained Vail&#x27;s contribution to enlightened corporate policy:
:Vail&#x27;s presidential essays in AT&amp;T annual reports are like nothing else in American business literature, before or since. They are personal, revealing, discursive, and sometimes pontifical. &quot;If we don&#x27;t tell the truth about ourselves, someone else will&quot;, Vail said in 1911. ... In 1907, he led off with a section entitled &quot;Public Relations&quot; – by which, as the context made clear, he meant not advertising and promotion, but the whole scope of relations between the corporation and the public. ... Vail introduced the concept ... that maximum private profit was not necessarily the &quot;primary&quot; objective of private enterprise. Profit was necessary to insure financial health...but was only one element in an equation.

==Other accomplishments==
In 1910, Vail founded the Vermont School of Agriculture in Lyndon, Vermont, which was subsequently merged into Lyndon Institute, a preparatory school.

Vail acquired the scientific book collection of George Edward Dering in 1911 and presented it to the library of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Vail Collection covers topics including &quot;electricity, magnetism, lighter-than-air travel, animal magnetism&quot; and others.

Vail also co-founded Junior Achievement in 1919.

<doc id="751065" wikidata="Q17103417" url="?curid=751065" title="MCX connector">
<text>MCX (micro coaxial connector) are coaxial RF connectors developed in the 1980s. They have the same inner contact and insulator dimensions as the SMB connector but are 30% smaller. MCX is standardized in European CECC 22220.

==Connector design==
MCX connectors use a snap-on interface and usually have a 50 Ω impedance (some are 75 Ω) . They offer broadband capability from DC to 6 GHz. The contact surfaces are gold-plated.

The outer diameter of the plug is approx 3.6 mm or 0.140 inch.

==Use==
MCX and the smaller MMCX connector are frequently used to connect external antennas 
to GPS receivers. They are also common on USB DVB-T tuners for computers and laptops, to connect an external antenna to the tuner.

The MCX connector is also being used on at least some of the new generation of mostly inexpensive software-defined oscilloscopes and/or signal generators such as the DS212. This is a low frequency application, at most a few MHz bandwidth, so the electrical performance characteristics are relatively unimportant, however the small size would appear to be an important feature.

<doc id="751067" wikidata="Q1362043" url="?curid=751067" title="Beerenauslese">
<text>Beerenauslese () is a German language wine term for a late harvest wine with noble rot. Beerenauslese is a category in the &quot;Prädikatswein&quot; category of the Austrian and German wine classifications, and is a category above Auslese. Beerenauslese wines, often called &quot;BA&quot; for short, are usually made from grapes affected by noble rot, that is &quot;botrytized&quot; grapes.

The grapes for &quot;Beerenauslese&quot; wines are those that have been individually picked. These wines are typically very sweet and rich, and most age very well. The finest Beerenauslese wines are generally considered to be made from the Riesling grape variety, as this retains significant acidity even with the extreme ripeness, which results in a wine where the sweetness is balanced and which has great longevity and which often will improve for decades. These wines are produced in very small quantities when the weather is suitable for the noble rot to form and only in vineyards with appropriate conditions, so they tend to be very expensive.

An exception to this is Beerenauslesen produced from more easily ripening grapes such as Ortega or Huxelrebe which have extremely high sugar content, but less noble rot character and less acidity, and therefore tends to come across as less elegant and usually without the potential to improve with cellaring.

In Alsace, the term most closely corresponding to Beerenauslese is Sélection de Grains Nobles.

== Requirements ==

The minimum must weight requirements for Beerenauslese is as follows:
* For German wine, 110 to 128 degrees Oechsle, depending on the region (wine growing zone) and grape variety.
* In Austrian wine, 25 degrees KMW, corresponding to 127 °Oechsle.

Chaptalisation may not be used. The requirements are part of the wine law in both countries. Many producers, especially top-level producers, exceed the minimum requirements, resulting in richer and sweeter wines that can exceed the minimum requirements for Trockenbeerenauslese, the next &quot;Prädikat&quot; in order. In Germany, it is common to add a golden capsule to indicate a superior wine.

<text>Waldemar, Valdemar or Woldemar is an Old High German given name. It consists of the elements &quot;wald-&quot; &quot;power&quot;, &quot;brightness&quot; and &quot;-mar&quot; &quot;fame&quot;.

The name is considered the equivalent of the Latvian name Valdemārs, the Estonian name Voldemar, and the Slavic names Vladimir, Volodymyr, Uladzimir or Włodzimierz.

The Old Norse form &quot;Valdamarr&quot; (also &quot;Valdarr&quot;) occurs in the Guðrúnarkviða II as the name of a king of the Danes. The Old Norse form is also used in Heimskringla, in the story of Harald Hardrada, as the name of a ruler of Holmgard (Veliky Novgorod). The &quot;Fagrskinna&quot; kings&#x27; sagas also have &quot;Valdamarr&quot;, in reference to both Vladimir the Great and Vladimir Yaroslavovich.

<text>The Honolulu Fire Department (HFD) provides fire protection and first responder emergency medical services to the City &amp; County of Honolulu, Hawaii, United States, under the jurisdiction of the Mayor of Honolulu. Founded on December 27, 1850, by Kamehameha III and Alexander Cartwright, the Honolulu Fire Department serves and protects the entire island of O&#x27;ahu, covering over of territory, home to more than 880,000 residents and over 4 million annual visitors.

The HFD is one of just a handful of fire departments in the nation that is Nationally accredited. The Commission on Fire Accreditation International (CFAI) confers Accredited Agency status for a period of five years.

== History ==
In the early 1800s, with an influx of missionaries, whalers, and businessmen to Hawai&#x27;i, Honolulu grew rapidly with western-style wooden buildings, which were highly combustible. Interior lighting in that period consisted of all flame-emitting equipment (candles, lamps, and lanterns); therefore fires became common in homes and businesses. On October 24, 1850, a public assembly raised the concern of the people to have adequate fire protection; and an outcome of this meeting was the formation of Honolulu&#x27;s first Volunteer Fire Brigade, on November 6, 1850. The HFD holds the distinction of being the first fire department in all of the Hawaiian Islands.

=== Establishment of the HFD ===
On December 27, 1850, an ordinance issued by Kamehameha III established the Honolulu Fire Department. On February 3, 1851, Oahu Governor Kekuanaoa appointed Alexander Joy Cartwright Jr. to be Chief Engineer of the Fire Department of the City of Honolulu, making him the first Fire Engineer of the newly formed department. The ordinance was enacted into law by the Hawaiian Legislature of 1851 (S.S. 1851, pp. 5-ll), becoming effective on May 8, 1851, after it was signed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, William L. Lee, and King Kamehameha.

The HFD is also the only fire department in the United States that was established by the order of the King of a Monarchy; and the department was continued by a Provisional Government, then a Republic, then a Territory, a County and lastly by a City and County Government. Honolulu, which was the Capital of the Territory of Hawaii, is believed to be the only fire department in the world that has had kings serve as active members with King Kamehameha III, who reigned during the 1850s and King David Kalakaua, during the 1880s working alongside volunteers.

==== Hawaiian Engine Company No. 4 ====
King Kalākaua was a member of Engine Company No. 4, which was originally an all-Hawaiian Company established in 1861. Prince Albert Kamehameha, a toddler at the time, admired Company 4 and was made an honorary member. After his death at the age of five, the entire HFD joined his funeral procession. When King Kalākaua died in 1891, firefighters draped black fabric on their stations to show their respect for the King.

==== Chinatown Fire of 1886 ====
On April 18, 1886, a fire started in a building at Hotel and Smith streets and destroyed over 60 acres of buildings and involved a loss surpassing $1,453,000. Buildings had been constructed close together, allowing the fire to quickly spread in all directions. In response, on April 20, 1886, the Board of Fire Underwriters was formed. On May 29, 1886, King Kalākaua signed Honolulu&#x27;s first building laws (building codes).

==== Chinatown Fire of 1900 ====
In an effort to control the bubonic plague, blocks of buildings were burnt, one at a time. On April 20, 1900, the block next to Kaumakapili Church was set on fire. As the flame grew, the wind unexpectedly changed; and the fire spread to the steeple of the church and then began to spread quickly across the city. Firefighters worked hard to control the fire that swept Chinatown, burning 38 acres. The property losses totaled over $3,000,000.

=== Fire Museum ===
The Honolulu Fire Museum and Education Center is located in the former historic Kakaʻako Fire Station, built in 1928, and neighbors the HFD headquarters’ building, which was completed in 2006. The Engine Company occupied Kakaʻako Station on October 1, 1929, and the Ladder Truck Company moved on March 1, 1930. The Shop opened in 1931. Kaka’ako Fire Station was one of several HFD stations that were nominated to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

The museum shares the history of the HFD as well as the history of fire-fighting apparatus and gear. When the Japanese started bombing Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the HFD quickly responded to the crisis. The first of three responding HFD companies arrived to find Hickam Field&#x27;s fire station hit by bombs. Honolulu firefighters worked tirelessly to extinguish flames and save as many U.S. planes as possible, but the second wave of Japanese Zero aircraft approached. Hoseman Harry Tuck Lee Pang was shot and killed; Captains Thomas Macy and John Carreira died in a bomb blast. Six other firefighters were injured. The HFD lists among its members nine men who were awarded the Order of the Purple Heart, including three dead members who were awarded the medal in 1984. This made the HFD the only fire department on American soil whose members were attacked by a foreign nation and were awarded Purple Hearts relating to their duties. This honor is now only awarded to members of the Armed Forces wounded in battle.

The Honolulu Fire Museum and Education Center is open to the public one Saturday a month for free, guided tours. 

== Bureaus ==
Under the Fire Commission, Fire Chief, and Deputy Chief, there are three bureaus that support the fire suppression forces (Fire Operations): 
*Administrative Services Bureau
* Planning and Development 
* Support Services

=== Fire Operations Bureau ===
Fire Operations accounts for the majority of the activity in the HFD. They are responsible for all emergency response for the island of Oahu and respond to fires, emergency medical calls, hazardous materials incidents, motor vehicle accidents, natural disasters, and also perform technical rescues. 

==== Stations &amp; Apparatus ====
Below is a complete listing of all Honolulu Fire Department fire station and apparatus locations.
There are 25 single engine companies and some trucks might be KME or Pierce 


=== Administrative Services Bureau ===
* Mechanic Shop: provides maintenance to fire apparatus, as well as police vehicles.
* Safety &amp; Health: administers health related programs.

=== Planning and Development ===
* Fire Communication Center: this is the vital link between the public and fire suppression forces.
* Radio Shop: provides maintenance to radios and communication systems.

=== Support Services ===
Support Services manages and coordinates the Training and Research Bureau and the Fire Prevention Bureau, which also includes the Community Relations/Education section.

==== Training and Research Bureau ====
HFD accomplishes its mission largely by maintaining a well-equipped and highly trained, professional workforce of firefighters and rescue personnel. The Training and Research Bureau (TRB) conducts training for all phases of firefighting, emergency medical incidents, hazardous materials incidents, technical rescues, and professional development. TRB is located at the Charles H. Thurston Training Center in Honolulu.

==== Fire Prevention Bureau ====
The Fire Prevention Bureau (FPB) administers the fire prevention program for the City and County of Honolulu, which includes setting policies and procedures in the enforcement of fire codes and conducting fire investigations to determine the origin and cause of fires. The FPB conducts investigations as mandated by Chapter 132–4, Hawaii Revised Statutes, and has several sections:
* Administration: Issues permits and licenses.
* Code Enforcement: enforces fire codes and regulations for occupancies within the City and County.
* Plans Examining: reviews and approves building plans to ensure compliance with building codes and conduct investigations for permits.
* Support: responsible for testing of building fire protection systems.
* Fire Investigation: determines the origin, cause and circumstances of structure fires.
* Fire Education: develops and implements programs to help minimize injuries and fire losses and to reduce the dangers to first responders.

==== Community Relations ====
Community Relations/Education (CRO) is the liaison between the community and the HFD, and it coordinates ceremonies, funerals, and other events. CRO develops, coordinates, and administers fire safety and education programs promoting fire prevention and other public safety education programs. CRO manages the museum and offers fire safety classes. Class topics range from general fire safety prevention and preparedness tips, use of a fire extinguisher, understanding the common causes of fire, how to prevent fires, and what to do in case of a fire.

<doc id="751087" wikidata="Q381082" url="?curid=751087" title="Valdemar III of Denmark">
<text>Valdemar III (1314–1364) was King of Denmark from 1326 to 1329, while he was underage; he was also Duke of Schleswig as Valdemar V in 1325–26 and from 1330 to 1364. He was a rival king set up against the unsuccessful Christopher II and was widely opposed by his subjects. His term was ended when he abdicated. Sometimes the earlier King Valdemar the Young (c. 1209–1231) is also referred to as Valdemar III.

==Biography==
Valdemar&#x27;s father was Duke Eric II of Schleswig and his mother was Adelaide, daughter of Henry I of Rendsborg. When his distant kinsman and the head of the rival royal branch Christopher II of Denmark was exiled from his kingdom, Holsteiner and Danish high nobles got to choose a new king. Their choice fell to 11-year-old Duke Valdemar V of Schleswig, who was the head of the branch descended from King Abel of Denmark. Due to his young age, his maternal uncle, the mighty Count Gerhard of Rendsborg (Gerhard III of Holstein) who also was the biggest pawnbroker of mortgaged Denmark, was appointed as the Regent and guardian ( or ).

Valdemar&#x27;s ascension promissory was at least as strict as Christopher&#x27;s had been. There were some new stipulations, such as all royal castles in Scania should be demolished, and all nobles received the right to fortify their homesteads. The most important agreement, however, was the so-called &quot;Constitutio Valdemariana&quot;, which promised that in the future, the same person could never be both ruler of Slesvig and Denmark simultaneously. Valdemar accordingly gave up his patrimony, Schleswig, and enfeoffed it to his uncle and guardian, whereby the first Holsteinian became a Duke: Gerhard, Duke of Jutland (or Southern Jutland or Schleswig).

Denmark was now held totally by certain nobles, in practice. That was not popular among the peasants. A portion of the nobles were foreigners, and many set up new taxes. In 1328, peasants in Zealand rose in rebellion, though it was quelled, and a rebellion in Jutland followed in 1329; the Jutland rebellion had more success, but was also quelled in the end. Finally, count Gerhard gave up in the name of his king, and in 1329 Christopher II was allowed to return to the throne. Valdemar became again Duke of Schleswig.

In 1340, he gave his only sister Helvig of Schleswig to marriage with Valdemar IV, the new king of Denmark. During the rest of his rule he led a changeable policy towards Denmark by which war alternated with co-operation.

Valdemar died in 1364. He was married to Richardis of Schwerin (died 1384), daughter of Count Günzelin VI of Schwerin-Wittenburg. They had two sons, Valdemar (1338–1360) and Henry (1342–1375). Henry succeeded as Duke of Schleswig when his father died.

<text>Dagestan ( ; ; ), officially the Republic of Dagestan, is a republic of Russia situated in the North Caucasus of Eastern Europe, along the Caspian Sea. It is located north of the Greater Caucasus, and is a part of the North Caucasian Federal District. The republic is the southernmost tip of Russia, sharing land borders with the countries of Azerbaijan and Georgia to the south and southwest, the Russian republics of Chechnya and Kalmykia to the west and north, and with Stavropol Krai to the northwest. Makhachkala is the republic&#x27;s capital and largest city; other major cities are Derbent, Kizlyar, Izberbash, Kaspiysk, and Buynaksk.

Dagestan covers an area of , with a population of over 3.1 million, consisting of over 30 ethnic groups and 81 nationalities. With 14 official languages, and 12 ethnic groups each constituting more than 1% of its total population, the republic is one of Russia&#x27;s most linguistically and ethnically diverse, and one of the most heterogeneous administrative divisions in the world. Most of the residents speak one of the Northeast Caucasian, or Turkic languages; however, Russian is the primary language and the lingua franca in the republic.

==Toponymy==

The word &quot;Dagestan&quot; is of Turkish and Persian origin, directly translating to &quot;land of the mountains&quot;. The Turkish word means &quot;mountain&quot;, and the Persian suffix &quot;-stan&quot; means &quot;land&quot;.

Some areas of Dagestan were known as &quot;Lekia&quot;, &quot;Avaria&quot; and &quot;Tarki&quot; at various times.

Between 1860 and 1920, &quot;Dagestan&quot; was referred to as Dagestan Oblast, corresponding to the southeastern part of the present-day republic. The current borders were created with the establishment of the Dagestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1921, with the incorporation of the eastern part of Terek Oblast, which is not mountainous but includes the Terek littoral at the southern end of the Caspian Depression.

==Administrative divisions==

==History==

In the first few centuries AD, Caucasian Albania (corresponding to modern Azerbaijan and southern Dagestan) became a vassal and eventually subordinate to the Parthian Empire. With the advent of the Sasanian Empire, it became a satrapy (province) within the vast domains of the empire. In later antiquity, a few wars were fought as the Roman Empire unsuccessfully attempted to contest Sasanid rule over the region. Over the centuries, to a relatively large extent, the peoples within the Dagestan territory converted to Christianity alongside Zoroastrianism.

In the 5th century, the Sassanids gained the upper hand, and by the 6th century had constructed a strong citadel at Derbent, known from then on as the Caspian Gates, while the Huns overran the northern part of Dagestan, followed by the Caucasian Avars. During the Sassanian era, southern Dagestan became a bastion of Persian culture and civilization, with its center at Derbent. A policy of &quot;Persianisation&quot; can be traced over many centuries.

===Islamic influence===
During the Islamic conquests, the Dagestani people (region of Derbent) were the first people to become Muslims within current Russian territory, after the Arab conquest of the region in 643. In the 8th century Arabs repeatedly clashed with the Khazars. Although the local population rose against the Arabs of Derbent in 905 and 913, Islam was still adopted in urban centers, such as Samandar and Kubachi (Zerechgeran), from where it steadily diffused into the highlands. By the 15th century, Christianity had died away, leaving a 10th-century Church of Datuna as the sole monument to its existence.

===Seljuk Turks===

In the second half of the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks took part of the region of Dagestan under their control.

===Mongol rule===
The Mongols raided the lands in 1221–1222 then conquered Derbent and the surrounding area from 1236 to 1239 during the invasions of Georgia and Durdzuketia.

===Timurids===
The Timurids incorporated the region into their realm following the Mongols.

===Alternating Persian and Russian rule===

As Mongolian authority gradually eroded, new centers of power emerged in Kaitagi and Tarki. In the early 16th century, the Persians (under the Safavids) reconsolidated their rule over the region, which would, intermittently, last till the early 19th century. In the 16th and 17th centuries, legal traditions were codified, and mountainous communities (&quot;djamaats&quot;) obtained considerable autonomy. In the 1720s, as a result of the disintegration of the Safavids and the Russo-Persian War (1722–23), the Russians briefly annexed maritime Dagestan from the Safavids. The Russians could not hold on to the interior of Dagestan, and could only be stopped in front of Baku with the help of Ottoman forces under the command of Mustafa Pasha. With a treaty signed between Russia and the Ottoman Empire in 1724, aimed at dividing the territories of Safavid Iran between them, Derbend, Baku and some other places in the region were left to Russia. Dagestan briefly came under Ottoman rule between 1578 and 1606.

The territories were however returned to Persia in 1735 per the Treaty of Ganja.

Between 1730 and the early course of the 1740s, following his brother&#x27;s murder in Dagestan, the new Persian ruler and military genius Nader Shah led a lengthy campaign in swaths of Dagestan in order to fully conquer the region, which was met with considerable success, although eventually he was forced to withdraw due to the extremity of the weather, the outbreak of disease and heavy raids by the various ethnic groups of Dagestan, forcing him to retreat with his army. From 1747 onwards, the Persian-ruled part of Dagestan was administered through the Derbent Khanate, with its center at Derbent. The Persian expedition of 1796 resulted in the Russian capture of Derbent in 1796. However, the Russians were again forced to retreat from the entire Caucasus following internal governmental problems, allowing Persia to capture the territory again.

===Russian rule consolidated===
It was not until the aftermath of the Russo-Persian War (1804–1813) that Russian power over Dagestan was confirmed, and that Qajar Persia officially ceded the territory to Russia. In 1813, following Russia&#x27;s victory in the war, Persia was forced to cede southern Dagestan with its principal city of Derbent, alongside other vast territories in the Caucasus to Russia, conforming with the Treaty of Gulistan. The 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay indefinitely consolidated Russian control over Dagestan and removed Persia from the military equation.

===Uprisings against imperial Russia===

The Russian administration, however, disappointed and embittered the highlanders. The institution of heavy taxation, coupled with the expropriation of estates and the construction of fortresses (including Makhachkala), electrified highlanders into rising under the aegis of the Muslim Imamate of Dagestan, led by Ghazi Mohammed (1828–1832), Hamzat Bek (1832–1834) and Shamil (1834–1859). This Caucasian War raged until 1864.

Dagestan and Chechnya profited from the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), rising together against the Russian Empire. Chechnya rose again at various times throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries.

===Soviet era===
On December 21, 1917, Ingushetia, Chechnya, Dagestan and the rest of the North Caucasus declared independence from Russia and formed a single state called the &quot;United Mountain Dwellers of the North Caucasus&quot; (also known as the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus). The capital of the new state was moved to Temir-Khan-Shura. The first prime minister of the state was Tapa Chermoyev, a prominent Chechen statesman. The second prime minister was an Ingush statesman Vassan-Girey Dzhabagiev, who in 1917 also became the author of the constitution of the land, and in 1920 was re-elected for a third term. After the Bolshevik Revolution, Ottoman armies occupied Azerbaijan and Dagestan and the region became part of the short-lived Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus. After more than three years of fighting the White Army and local nationalists, the Bolsheviks achieved victory and the Dagestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was proclaimed on January 20, 1921. As the newly created Soviet Union was consolidating control in the region, Dagestan declared itself a republic within the Russian Soviet federation but did not follow the other ASSRs in declaring sovereignty.

===Post-Soviet era===
On August 7, 1999, the Islamic International Peacekeeping Brigade (IIPB), an Islamist group from Chechnya led by warlords Shamil Basayev, Ibn Al-Khattab and Ramzan Akhmadov, launched a military invasion of Dagestan, in support of the Shura separatist rebels with the aim of creating an &quot;independent Islamic State of Dagestan&quot;.

The invaders were supported by part of the local population but were driven back by the Russian military and local paramilitary groups. In response to the invasion, Russian forces subsequently reinvaded Chechnya later that year.

Dagestan has one of the highest unemployment rates in Russia.

Dagestani soldiers participated in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, many of whom were killed in action. In September, Dagestan became a center of the 2022 North Caucasian protests against mobilization.

In 2023, during the Hamas-Israel war, there were a wave of antisemitic attacks across the North Caucasus, including Dagestan.

==Politics==
The parliament of Dagestan is the People&#x27;s Assembly, consisting of 72 deputies elected for a four-year term. The People&#x27;s Assembly is the highest executive and legislative body of the republic.

The Constitution of Dagestan was adopted on July 10, 2003. According to it, the highest executive authority lies with the State Council, comprising representatives of fourteen ethnicities. The Constitutional Assembly of Dagestan appoints the members of the State Council for a term of four years. The State Council appoints the members of the Government.

The ethnicities represented in the State Council are Avars, Dargins, Kumyks, Lezgins, Laks, Azerbaijanis, Tabasarans, Russians, Chechens, Nogais, Aguls, Rutuls, Tsakhurs, and Tats.

Formerly, the Chairman of the State Council was the highest executive post in the republic, held by Magomedali Magomedovich Magomedov until 2006. On February 20, 2006, the People&#x27;s Assembly passed a resolution terminating this post and disbanding the State Council. Russian president, Vladimir Putin offered the People&#x27;s Assembly the candidature of Mukhu Aliyev for the newly established post of the president of the Republic of Dagestan. The People&#x27;s Assembly accepted the nomination, and Mukhu Aliyev became the first president of the republic. On February 20, 2010, Aliyev was replaced by Magomedsalam Magomedov. Ramazan Abdulatipov then became the head (acting 2013–2017, following the resignation of Magomedov). On October 3, 2017, Vladimir Vasilyev was appointed as head.

In the 2024 Russian presidential election, which critics called rigged and fraudulent, President Vladimir Putin won 92.93% of the vote in Dagestan.

==Demographics==
Because its mountainous terrain impedes travel and communication, Dagestan is unusually ethnically diverse and still largely tribal. It is Russia&#x27;s most heterogeneous republic. Dagestan&#x27;s population is rapidly growing.

===Ethnic groups===
The people of Dagestan include a large variety of ethnicities. According to the 2021 Census, Northeast Caucasians (including Avars, Dargins, Lezgins, Laks, Tabasarans, Rutulians and Chechens) make up almost 75% of the population of Dagestan. Turkic peoples, Kumyks, Azerbaijanis, and Nogais make up 21%, and Russians 3.3%. Other ethnicities (e.g. Tats, who are an Iranian people) each account for less than 0.4% of the total population.

Such groups as the Botlikh, the Andi, the Akhvakhs, the Tsez and about ten other groups were reclassified as Avars between the 1926 and 1939 censuses.

===Languages===

More than 30 local languages are commonly spoken, most belonging to the Nakh-Daghestanian language family. Russian became the principal lingua franca in Dagestan during the 20th century; Over 20 of Russia&#x27;s 131 endangered languages as identified by UNESCO can be found in Dagestan. Most of these endangered languages have speakers in the mountainous region on the Dagestan-Georgia border.

Prior to Soviet rule, the literary lingua-franca status to some extent belonged to Classical Arabic. The northern Avar dialect of Khunzakh has also served as a lingua franca in mountainous Dagestan where Avar-related peoples lived. And throughout centuries the Kumyk language had been the lingua-franca for the bigger part of the Northern Caucasus, from Dagestan to Kabarda, until the 1930s. Kumyk also had been an official language for communication of the Russian Imperial administration with the local peoples.

The first Russian grammar written about a language from present-day Dagestan was for Kumyk. Author Timofey Makarov wrote:

===Religion===

According to a 2012 survey which interviewed 56,900 people, 83% of the population of Dagestan adheres to Islam, 2.4% to the Russian Orthodox Church, 2% to Caucasian folk religion and other native faiths, 1% are non-denominational Christians. In addition, 9% of the population identify as &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot;, 2% as atheist, and 0.6% as other and no answer.

==== Islam ====

Dagestanis adherents of Islam are largely Sunni Muslims of the Shafii school. On the Caspian coast, particularly in and around the port city of Derbent, the population (primarily made up of Azerbaijanis) is Shia. A Salafi minority is also present, which is sometimes a target of official repression.

The appearance of Sufi mysticism in Dagestan dates back to the 14th century. The two Sufi orders that are widely spread in the North Caucasus were the Naqshbandiya and the Qadiriya. The mystic tariqas preached tolerance and coexistence between the diverse people in the region. The Communist total intolerance for any religion after the Communist Revolution of 1917 also suppressed the Sufi movements. Shaykh Said Afandi al-Chirkawi was a prominent scholar, spiritual leader, and murshid (guide) of Naqshbandi and Shadhili tariqahs in Dagestan until his death.

Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, there has been an Islamic revival in the region. By 1996, Dagestan had 1,670 registered mosques, nine Islamic universities, 25 madrassas, 670 maktab, and it is estimated that &quot;nearly one in five Dagestanis was involved in Islamic education&quot;, while of the 20,000 or so Russian pilgrims for the Hajj more than half were from Dagestan.

==== Judaism ====

A relatively large number of native Tati-speaking Jews – the &quot;Mountain Jews&quot; – were also present in these same coastal areas. However, since 1991 and the collapse of the Soviet Union, many have migrated to Israel and the United States. These were an extension of much larger Azerbaijani Jewish community across the border in the Azerbaijani districts of Quba and Shamakhi.

==== Christianity ====

The number of Christians among the non-Slavic indigenous population is very low, with estimates between 2,000 and 2,500. Most of these are Pentecostal Christians from the Lak ethnicity. The largest congregation is Osanna Evangelical Christian Church (Pentecostal) in Makhachkala, with more than 1,000 members.
* Cathedral of the Assumption is an Eastern Orthodox cathedral located in the city of Makhachkala, the main cathedral of the Diocese of Makhachkala.
* Church of the Holy Equal-to-the-Apostles Prince Vladimir is a Russian Orthodox cathedral of the Diocese of Makhachkala, located in the city of Makhachkala.

=== Genetics ===
In 2006, a genetic study of the Dagestan populations, published in Human Biology, suggested that inhabitants of Dagestan are closely related to Anatolian Turks and Cypriot Turks. Yunusbayev et al. pointed out that these findings support the theory that indigenous groups of Dagestan can trace their roots back to ancient Anatolian farming tribes who introduced early agricultural traditions.

==Economy==
The major industries in Dagestan include oil production, engineering, chemicals, machine building, textile manufacturing, food processing and timber. Oil deposits are located in the narrow coastal region. Dagestan&#x27;s natural gas production goes mostly to satisfy local needs. Agriculture is varied and includes grain-farming, viticulture and wine-making, sheep-farming, and dairying. The engineering and metalworking industries own 20% of the republic&#x27;s industrial production assets and employ 25% of all industrial workers. Dagestan&#x27;s hydroelectric power industry is developing rapidly. There are five power plants on the Sulak River providing hydroelectric power. It has been estimated that Dagestan&#x27;s total potential hydroelectric power resources are 4.4 billion kW. Dagestan has a well-developed transportation system. Railways connect the capital Makhachkala to Moscow, Astrakhan, and the Azerbaijani capital, Baku. The Moscow-Baku highway also passes through Dagestan, and there are air links with major cities.

Conditions for economic development are favorable in Dagestan, but – – the republic&#x27;s low starting level for a successful transition to market relations, in addition to rampant corruption, has made the region highly dependent on its underground economy and the subsidies coming from the central Russian government. Corruption in Dagestan is more severe than in other regions of the former Soviet Union and is coupled with a flourishing black market and clan-based economic system.

In 2011 Rostelecom started the implementation of WDM-based equipment on the backbone network for data transmission in the Republic of Dagestan. Due to WDM introduction, the fiber-optic communication lines bandwidth increased to 2.5 Gbit/s. Rostelecom invested about 48 million rubles in the project.

== Culture ==

=== Literature ===
Epic-historical songs about the defeat of the armies of Afshar Turk Nadir Shah and various episodes of the nineteenth-century wars are popular among the Avars. Best-known are the ballads &quot;Khochbar&quot; and &quot;Kamalil Bashir&quot;. In the second half of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, Avar culture and literature grew significantly. Well-known Avar literary figures include the poets Aligaji of Inkho (who died 1875) and Chanka (1866–1909), the lyric poet Makhmud (1873–1919), the satirist Tsadasa Gamzat (1877–1951), and the poet Rasul Gamzatov (1923–2003). Among his poems was Zhuravli, which became a well-known Russian song.

=== Music ===
There is a Dagestani Philharmonic Orchestra and a State Academic Dance Ensemble. Gotfrid Hasanov, who is said to be the first professional composer from Dagestan, wrote &quot;Khochbar,&quot; the first Dagestani opera, in 1945. Dagestani folk dances include a fast-paced dance called the &quot;lezginka&quot;. It derives its names from the Lezgin people; nevertheless, Azerbaijanis, Circassians, Abkhazians, Mountain Jews, Caucasian Avars, the Russian Kuban, and Terek Cossacks and many other tribes have their own versions.

=== Cuisine ===
&quot;Khingal-bat&quot; is Dagestan&#x27;s national dish of small dumplings boiled in ram&#x27;s broth. Depending on the cook&#x27;s ethnicity, the dumplings can be oval or round, filled with meat or cheese, and served with a garlic or sour cream sauce. Dairy products and meat constitute a large part of the diet in the mountainous regions, while in the valley zones, vegetables and grain flour are eaten in addition to fruits, edible gourds, edible herbs, and wild grasses.

=== Martial arts ===
In recent times the region has been recognized for producing some of the world&#x27;s best athletes in combat sports and produces the most MMA fighters of any region relative to population. Dagestani born Khabib Nurmagomedov was a UFC lightweight champion who retired undefeated. His training partner, Islam Makhachev, who is also Dagestani, is the current UFC pound-for-pound and lightweight champion. Khabib&#x27;s cousin, Umar Nurmagomedov, is ranked #3 in the UFC&#x27;s bantamweight division. Umar&#x27;s younger brother, Usman Nurmagomedov, is the current Bellator lightweight champion. Magomed Ankalaev, who also hails from Dagestan, fought for the UFC light heavyweight championship in 2022. Abubakar Nurmagomedov is also a cousin of Khabib&#x27;s who is Dagestani, he is also a professional MMA fighter with a professional record of 17-4-1.

Dagestan has also historically produced a disproportionate number of Olympic and world champions in freestyle wrestling. Considered by some as the greatest freestyle wrestlers of all time Buvaisar Saitiev who was a three time Olympic champion and Abdulrashid Sadulaev who won gold at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics are from Dagestan. 

In boxing, Artur Beterbiev is a one time World Cup gold medalist, two time Olympian and the current (October 2024) WBA (Super), WBC, IBF, WBO, IBO, and The Ring undisputed light heavyweight champion, winning 21 fights and 20 by knockout.

<text>Conexión Caribe is a 1984 film starring members of Los Chicos, a Puerto Rican boy band of the 1980s, Tony, Migue, Chayanne, Rey and Alex.

== Plot summary ==
Taking advantage of the fame of Los Chicos in Puerto Rico and Central America, and after the relative success of the movie Una Aventura Llamada Menudo, producer and director Orestes Trucco wrote a script for the movie aimed at the pre-teen and teen markets. Puerto Rican actors Juan Manuel Lebrón and Otilio Warrington starred as members of a mafia-type organization in charge of the so-called Conexión Caribe (Caribbean Connection). Movie starts at a concert location for Los Chicos where Migue, the oldest member of the band, was kidnapped prior to the show. This opportunity is used to introduce the new member of the band, Alex Rodríguez. After the concert, the band received a call to attend a port in Fajardo to rescue Migue. The members of the band escape police protection and they make their way to the port, where Migue is safely in a boat with a group of girls and ready for a vacation trip around the Caribbean. However, the owner and captain of the boat is also member of the plot, which eventually ends in another kidnap, a visit to Casa de Campo in Dominican Republic and the eventual return to a deluxe hotel in San Juan, where the secret operation is revealed: it was only a ploy to bring Los Chicos to Don Padrone&#x27;s (Warrington) daughter 15th year birthday party. Furthermore, it is also revealed that the mafia-type organization was not such a thing but a group of policemen who are all friends and work undercover (&quot;good guys&quot;, not &quot;bad guys&quot; as Lebron&#x27;s character clarifies towards the end) instead. A special participation by Sandra Zaiter, spokesperson for Society of Handicapped Children and Adults, ends the movie with a diving exhibition by Los Chicos in an olympic-style pool.

== Facts about the film ==

*Film locations include former Escambrón swimming complex, Fajardo, Casa de Campo, Dominican Republic and the Condado Plaza Hotel, formerly Condado Holiday Inn.
*The Escambron swimming pool closed shortly after the movie was filmed. It became a condemned facility which eventually was imploded after the death of Liliana Barbarita Cepeda.
*Future San Juan Mayor Santini&#x27;s wife Irma Garriga featured as one of the minor characters in the film.
*After the movie was completed and the soundtrack was recorded, three of the members of the group (including Chayanne) quit the group, alleging poor working conditions. The soundtrack for the movie was re-recorded by the new members. However, one of the songs sung by Chayanne was left as first recorded, so the album could be marketed as &quot;Los Chicos featuring Chayanne&quot;, which clearly was the most popular member of the group.
*Movie was premiered on January 5, 1984. Only one of the original members (Tony) was present.

<text>Queen of Angels is a 1990 science fiction novel written by Greg Bear. It was nominated for the Hugo, Campbell and Locus Awards in 1991. It was followed by a sequel, &quot;/&quot;, also known as &quot;Slant&quot;.

== Plot summary ==

&quot;Queen of Angels&quot; describes our world just prior to the binary millennium (2048 AD) through several parallel (and to some degree interlocking) tales. Nanotechnology has transformed almost every aspect of American society, and its application to psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience has resulted in new techniques for mental &quot;therapy&quot; that have created new forms of social stratification. Increasingly, individuals are &quot;therapied: &quot;by means of &quot;nano-therapy,&quot; they are turned into well-integrated personalities capable of productive work and constructive social interaction, which does not threaten the social order. Therapied individuals have access to the best jobs. There are two other classes: the &quot;high naturals,&quot; who possess such a positive mental makeup that they do not need any therapy, and the &quot;untherapied,&quot; who find themselves increasingly marginalized.

The central unifying element involves a famous writer, Emmanuel Goldsmith, who has committed a gruesome series of murders, a crime almost unheard of in the age of therapy. One storyline involves Mary Choy, a high natural police detective assigned to the case to track down and arrest the murderer. Mary is a transform since she has chosen to have her body extensively altered by nanotechnology to enhance her abilities as a policewoman and also for aesthetic reasons.

A second storyline involves Richard Fettle, a good friend of the murderer, also an untherapied writer, who must come to terms with what happened to his friend and how his artists&#x27; lives, and all of the untherapied must change. The third plot line concerns Martin Burke, a pioneer in psychotherapy who uses a technique which allows him to directly enter and interact with a patient&#x27;s psychology, the &quot;Country of the Mind,&quot; through a sort of virtual reality. Although disgraced at the story&#x27;s opening, Dr. Burke is given the opportunity to use his technique to explore Goldsmith&#x27;s mind, which turns out to be one of the most fascinating and dangerous minds imaginable.

Finally, the fourth plotline considers the nature of artificial intelligence, as an AI robot space probe discovers life on a planet in the Alpha Centauri system and simultaneously achieves its own independent self-awareness, as does its twin back on Earth.

The novel deals with issues of technology, identity, the nature of justice, and the existence of consciousness and the soul. &quot;Queen of Angels&quot;, set in 2047, was written just before the creation of the first website in 1991 and describes a global network based on the exchange of text (a sort of super USENET), whereas the sequel, &quot;Slant&quot;, set in 2055 and written in 1997 after the coming of the World Wide Web, describes a global network which has inexplicably changed to resemble a vast shared virtual reality.

Also in the novel is &quot;Citizen Oversight,&quot; a quasi-governmental agency that collects data on citizens: medical, financial, legal. It also collects information from public sources such as video cameras with facial recognition and has the ability to track individuals. Local police agencies can appeal to Citizen Oversight to conduct a query on an individual and Citizen Oversight may or may not give out the requested information, based on their interpretation of the &quot;Raphkind Amendment.&quot;

<doc id="751106" wikidata="Q557151" url="?curid=751106" title="Anchoring effect">
<text>The anchoring effect is a psychological phenomenon in which an individual&#x27;s judgments or decisions are influenced by a reference point or &quot;anchor&quot; which can be completely irrelevant. Both numeric and non-numeric anchoring have been reported in research. In numeric anchoring, once the value of the anchor is set, subsequent arguments, estimates, etc. made by an individual may change from what they would have otherwise been without the anchor. For example, an individual may be more likely to purchase a car if it is placed alongside a more expensive model (the anchor). Prices discussed in negotiations that are lower than the anchor may seem reasonable, perhaps even cheap to the buyer, even if said prices are still relatively higher than the actual market value of the car. Another example may be when estimating the orbit of Mars, one might start with the Earth&#x27;s orbit (365 days) and then adjust upward until they reach a value that seems reasonable (usually less than 687 days, the correct answer).

The original description of the anchoring effect came from psychophysics. When judging stimuli along a continuum, it was noticed that the first and last stimuli were used to compare the other stimuli (this is also referred to as &quot;end anchoring&quot;). This was applied to attitudes by Sherif et al. in their 1958 article &quot;Assimilation and effects of anchoring stimuli on judgments&quot;.

==Experimental findings==

The anchoring and adjustment heuristic was first theorized by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman. In one of their first studies, participants were asked to compute, within 5 seconds, the product of the numbers one through to eight, either as or reversed as . Because participants did not have enough time to calculate the full answer, they had to make an estimate after their first few multiplications. When these first multiplications gave a small answer – because the sequence started with small numbers – the median estimate was 512; when the sequence started with the larger numbers, the median estimate was 2,250. (The correct answer is 40,320.) In another study by Tversky and Kahneman, participants were asked to estimate the percentage of African countries in the United Nations. Before estimating, the participants first observed a roulette wheel that was predetermined to stop on either 10 or 65. Participants whose wheel stopped on 10 guessed lower values (25% on average) than participants whose wheel stopped at 65 (45% on average). The pattern has held in other experiments for a wide variety of different subjects of estimation.

As a second example, in a study by Dan Ariely, an audience is first asked to write the last two digits of their social security number and consider whether they would pay this number of dollars for items whose value they did not know, such as wine, chocolate and computer equipment. They were then asked to bid for these items, with the result that the audience members with higher two-digit numbers would submit bids that were between 60 percent and 120 percent higher than those with the lower social security numbers, which had become their anchor. When asked if they believed the number was informative of the value of the item, quite a few said yes. Trying to avoid this confusion, a small number of studies used procedures that were clearly random, such as Excel random generator button and die roll, and failed to replicate anchoring effects.

The anchoring effect was also found to be present in a study in the &quot;Journal of Real Estate Research&quot; in relation to house prices. In this investigation, it was established that the 2-year and 9-year highs on the Case-Shiller House Price Index could be used as anchors in predicting current house prices. The findings were used to indicate that, in forecasting house prices, these 2-year and 9-years highs might be relevant.

The anchoring effect was also found to be present in a study in the &quot;Journal of Behavioral Finance&quot; in relation to stock purchase behavior. The study found that when using an app-based stock brokerage, an investor’s first stock purchase price serves as an anchor for future stock purchases. The findings indicate that when investors start by making only a small stock purchase, they end up with less accumulated investments in the long run.

== Characteristics ==

===Difficulty of avoiding===
Various studies have shown that anchoring is very difficult to avoid. For example, in one study students were given anchors that were wrong. They were asked whether Mahatma Gandhi died before or after age 9, or before or after age 140. Clearly neither of these anchors can be correct, but when the two groups were asked to suggest when they thought he had died, they guessed significantly differently (average age of 50 vs. average age of 67).

Other studies have tried to eliminate anchoring much more directly. In a study exploring the causes and properties of anchoring, participants were exposed to an anchor and asked to guess how many physicians were listed in the local phone book. In addition, they were explicitly informed that anchoring would &quot;contaminate&quot; their responses, and that they should do their best to correct for that. A control group received no anchor and no explanation. Regardless of how they were informed and whether they were informed correctly, all of the experimental groups reported higher estimates than the control group. Thus, despite being expressly aware of the anchoring effect, most participants were still unable to avoid it. A later study found that even when offered monetary incentives, most people are unable to effectively adjust from an anchor.

Although it has been found through many research and experiments that attempt to mitigate the decision heuristic of anchoring bias is either marginally significant or not successful at all, it can be found that the consider-the-opposite (COS strategy) has been the most reliable in mitigating the anchoring bias (Adame, 2016). In short, the COS strategy is proposed to an individual by asking them to consider the possibilities the opposite of their perceptions and beliefs. Therefore, depriving the individual of their preexisting attitudes and limiting the decision bias. 

===Durability of anchoring===
Anchoring effects are also shown to remain adequately present given the accessibility of knowledge pertaining to the target. This, in turn, suggests that despite a delay in judgement towards a target, the extent of anchoring effects have seen to remain unmitigated within a given time period. A series of three experiments were conducted to test the longevity of anchoring effects. It was observed that despite a delay of one week being introduced for half the sample population of each experiment, similar results of immediate judgement and delayed judgement of the target were achieved. The experiments concluded that external information experienced within the delayed judgement period shows little influence relative to self-generated anchors even with commonly encountered targets (temperature) used in one of the experiments, showing that anchoring effects may precede priming in duration especially when the anchoring effects were formed during the task. Further research to conclude an effect that is effectively retained over a substantial period of time has proven inconsistent.

===Anchoring bias in groups===

Given the old saying that &#x27;Two Heads are Better than One&#x27;, it is often presumed that groups come to a more unbiased decision relative to individuals. However, this assumption is supported with varied findings that could not come to a general consensus. Nevertheless, while some groups are able to perform better than an individual member, they are found to be just as biased or even more biased relative to their individual counterparts. A possible cause would be the discriminatory fashion in which information is communicated, processed and aggregated based on each individual&#x27;s anchored knowledge and belief. This results in a diminished quality in the decision-making process and consequently, amplifies the pre-existing anchored biases.

The cause of group anchoring remains obscure. Group anchors may have been established at the group level or may simply be the culmination of several individual&#x27;s personal anchors. Previous studies have shown that when given an anchor before the experiment, individual members consolidated the respective anchors to attain a decision in the direction of the anchor placed. However, a distinction between individual and group-based anchor biases does exist, with groups tending to ignore or disregard external information due to the confidence in the joint decision-making process. The presence of pre-anchor preferences also impeded the extent to which external anchors affected the group decision, as groups tend to allocate more weight to self-generated anchors, according to the &#x27;competing anchor hypothesis&#x27;.

Recently, it has been suggested that the group member who speaks first often has an unproportionally high impact on the final decision.

A series of experiments were conducted to investigate anchoring bias in groups and possible solutions to avoid or mitigate anchoring. The first experiment established that groups are indeed influenced by anchors while the other two experiments highlighted methods to overcome group anchoring bias. Utilized methods include the use of process accountability and motivation through competition instead of cooperation to reduce the influence of anchors within groups.

=== Business intelligence ===
A peer-reviewed study sought to investigate the effect of business intelligence (BI) systems on the anchoring effect. Business intelligence denotes an array of software and services used by businesses to gather valuable insights into an organisation&#x27;s performance. The extent to which cognitive bias is mitigated by using these systems was the overarching question in this study. While the independent variable was the use of the BI system, the dependent variable was the outcome of the decision-making process. The subjects were presented with a &#x27;plausible&#x27; anchor and a &#x27;spurious&#x27; anchor in a forecasting decision. It was found that, while the BI system mitigated the negative effects of the spurious anchor, it had no influence on the effects of the plausible anchor. This is important in a business context, because it shows that humans are still susceptible to cognitive biases, even when using sophisticated technological systems. One of the subsequent recommendations from the experimenters was to implement a forewarning into BI systems as to the anchoring effect.

==Causes==
Several theories have been put forth to explain what causes anchoring, and although some explanations are more popular than others, there is no consensus as to which is best. In a study on possible causes of anchoring, two authors described anchoring as easy to demonstrate, but hard to explain. At least one group of researchers has argued that multiple causes are at play, and that what is called &quot;anchoring&quot; is actually several different effects.

===Anchoring-and-adjusting===
In their original study, Tversky and Kahneman put forth a view later termed anchoring-as-adjustment. According to this theory, once an anchor is set, people adjust away from it to get to their final answer; however, they adjust insufficiently, resulting in their final guess being closer to the anchor than it would be otherwise. Other researchers also found evidence supporting the anchoring-and-adjusting explanation. Factors that influence the capacity for judgmental correction, like alcohol intoxication and performing a taxing cognitive load (rehearsing a long string of digits in working memory) tend to increase anchoring effects. If people know the direction in which they should adjust, incentivizing accuracy also appears to reduce anchoring effects.

This model is not without its critiques. Proponents of alternative theories have criticized this model, claiming it is only applicable when the initial anchor is outside the range of acceptable answers. To use an earlier example, since Mahatma Gandhi obviously did not die at age 9, then people will adjust from there. If a reasonable number were given, though, there would be no adjustment. Therefore, this theory cannot, according to its critics, explain all cases of anchoring effect.

===Selective accessibility===
An alternate explanation regarding selective accessibility is derived from a theory called &quot;confirmatory hypothesis testing&quot;. In short, selective accessibility proposes that when given an anchor, a judge (i.e. a person making some judgment) will evaluate the hypothesis that the anchor is a suitable answer. Assuming it is not, the judge moves on to another guess, but not before accessing all the relevant attributes of the anchor itself. Then, when evaluating the new answer, the judge looks for ways in which it is similar to the anchor, resulting in the anchoring effect. Various studies have found empirical support for this hypothesis. This explanation assumes that the judge considers the anchor to be a plausible value so that it is not immediately rejected, which would preclude considering its relevant attributes. For example, an online-experiment showed that ratings of previous members of the crowd could act as an anchor. When displaying the results of previous ratings in the context of business model idea evaluation, people incorporate the displayed anchor into their own decision-making process, leading to a decreasing variance of ratings.

===Attitude change===
More recently, a third explanation of anchoring has been proposed concerning attitude change. According to this theory, providing an anchor changes someone&#x27;s attitudes to be more favorable to the particular attributes of that anchor, biasing future answers to have similar characteristics as the anchor. Leading proponents of this theory consider it to be an alternate explanation in line with prior research on anchoring-and-adjusting and selective accessibility.

=== Extremeness aversion ===
When estimating something, predictors are less likely to choose an amount which is close to the maximum allowable adjustment. According to the theory, predictors adjust less when an anchor is chosen. As a result, the final prediction results are close to the anchor.
==Influencing factors==

===Mood===
A wide range of research has linked sad or depressed moods with more extensive and accurate evaluation of problems. As a result of this, earlier studies hypothesized that people with more depressed moods would tend to use anchoring less than those with happier moods. However, more recent studies have shown the opposite effect: sad people are &quot;more&quot; likely to use anchoring than people with happy or neutral mood. In a study focusing on medical practitioners, it was found that physicians that possess positive moods are less susceptible to anchoring bias, when compared to physicians with neutral moods. This was specifically found to be because a positive mood leads to information processing that is more systematic which leads to more efficient problem solving. This leads to a decreased anchoring effect.

===Personal Experience===
Early research found that experts (those with high knowledge, experience, or expertise in some field) were more resistant to the anchoring effect. However, anchoring happens unconsciously which means that unless someone who is knowledgeable is warned prior, they are still susceptible to anchoring. Since then, however, numerous studies have demonstrated that while experience can sometimes reduce the effect, even experts are susceptible to anchoring. In a study concerning the effects of anchoring on judicial decisions, researchers found that even experienced legal professionals were affected by anchoring. This remained true even when the anchors provided were arbitrary and unrelated to the case in question. Also, this relates to goal setting, where more experienced individuals will set goals based on their past experiences which consequently affects end results in negotiations.
Expertise is when a judge has relevant knowledge. In a study using price estimation of cars, it was found that relevant knowledge positively influenced anchoring. Expertise in cognitive bias is related to experience however the two are not exclusively exhaustive. In a study using stock return estimates, it was found that expertise decreases behavioural bias significantly. It was found that other factors like cognitive ability and experience where there is no susceptibility to anchoring or a susceptibility as it increases, tend to become factors that decrease the effects of anchoring when they are an expert.

===Personality===
Research has correlated susceptibility to anchoring with most of the Big Five personality traits. The personality traits are as follows. Conscientiousness, a character that is orderly and responsible. Neuroticism, an individual that has an uneasy nature and is unstable. Extraversion which is where a person is sociable and outgoing in nature. Openness to experience which is an intelligent and creative personality trait. Agreeableness, where someone is polite and trusting. People high in agreeableness and conscientiousness and neuroticism are more likely to be affected by anchoring, while those high in extraversion and openness to experience are less likely to be affected. Studies have shown that those high in Openness to New Experiences and Agreeableness are more susceptible to anchoring.

===Cognitive ability===
The impact of cognitive ability on anchoring is contested. A recent study on willingness to pay for consumer goods found that anchoring decreased in those with greater cognitive ability, though it did not disappear. Another study, however, found that cognitive ability had no significant effect on how likely people were to use anchoring. In a poker-like experiment that included people of differing academic achievement and psychometric reasoning scoring, it has been found that anchoring is not related to education level. It also found that numerical reasoning and reflection scores had a negative association with anchoring susceptibility.

===Overconfidence===

Although overconfidence emanates from the heuristic and refers more specifically to a behavioural tendency to take their initial assessment and put more emphasis on it during making their initial assessment leading to cognitive conceit. Cognitive conceit or overconfidence arises from other factors like personal cognitive attributes such as knowledge and decision-making ability, decreasing the probability to pursue external sources of confirmation. This factor has also been shown to arise with tasks with greater difficulty. Even within subject matter experts, they were also prey to such behaviour of overconfidence and should more so, actively reduce such behaviour. Following the study of estimations under uncertain, despite several attempts to curb overconfidence proving unsuccessful, Tversky and Kahneman (1971) suggest an effective solution to overconfidence is for subjects to explicitly establish anchors to help reduce overconfidence in their estimates.

==Applications==

=== Anchoring in negotiation ===
In the negotiation process anchoring serves to determine an accepted starting point for the subsequent negotiations. As soon as one side states their first price offer, the (subjective) anchor is set. The counterbid (counter-anchor) is the second-anchor.

In addition to the initial research conducted by Tversky and Kahneman, multiple other studies have shown that anchoring can greatly influence the estimated value of an object. For instance, although negotiators can generally appraise an offer based on multiple characteristics, studies have shown that they tend to focus on only one aspect. In this way, a deliberate starting point can strongly affect the range of possible counteroffers. The process of offer and counteroffer results in a mutually beneficial arrangement. However, multiple studies have shown that initial offers have a stronger influence on the outcome of negotiations than subsequent counteroffers.

An example of the power of anchoring has been conducted during the Strategic Negotiation Process Workshops. During the workshop, a group of participants is divided into two sections: buyers and sellers. Each side receives identical information about the other party before going into a one-on-one negotiation. Following this exercise, both sides debrief about their experiences. The results show that where the participants anchor the negotiation had a significant effect on their success.

Anchoring affects everyone, even people who are highly knowledgeable in a field. Northcraft and Neale conducted a study to measure the difference in the estimated value of a house between students and real-estate agents. In this experiment, both groups were shown a house and then given different listing prices. After making their offer, each group was then asked to discuss what factors influenced their decisions. In the follow-up interviews, the real-estate agents denied being influenced by the initial price, but the results showed that both groups were equally influenced by that anchor.

Anchoring can have more subtle effects on negotiations as well. Janiszewski and Uy investigated the effects of precision of an anchor. Participants read an initial price for a beach house, then gave the price they thought it was worth. They received either a general, seemingly nonspecific anchor (e.g., $800,000) or a more precise and specific anchor (e.g., $799,800). Participants with a general anchor adjusted their estimate more than those given a precise anchor ($751,867 vs $784,671). The authors propose that this effect comes from difference in scale; in other words, the anchor affects not only the starting &quot;value&quot;, but also the starting &quot;scale&quot;. When given a general anchor of $20, people will adjust in large increments ($19, $21, etc.), but when given a more specific anchor like $19.85, people will adjust on a lower scale ($19.75, $19.95, etc.). Thus, a more specific initial price will tend to result in a final price closer to the initial one.

As for the question of setting the first or second anchor, the party setting the second anchor has the advantage in that the counter-anchor determines the point midway between both anchors. Due to a possible lack of knowledge the party setting the first anchor can also set it too low, i.e. against their own interests. Generally negotiators who set the first anchor also tend to be less satisfied with the negotiation outcome, than negotiators who set the counter-anchor. This may be due to the regret or sense that they did not achieve or rather maximise the full potential of the negotiations. However, studies suggest that negotiators who set the first offer frequently achieve economically more advantageous results.

== Individual differences in anchoring ==
Tversky and Kahneman suggest that the anchoring effect is the product of anchoring and adjustment heuristics whereby estimates are made starting from an anchor value which is then adjusted in until the individual has reached an answer. Kahneman suggests that anchoring occurs from derivations from anchor-consistent knowledge. In their paper on anchoring bias Kahneman and Tversky showed that people judgements could be skewed either higher or lower when presented with random numbers either high or low before their prediction.

Predrag Teovanović’s study ‘Individual Differences in Anchoring Effect: Evidence for the Role of Insufficient Adjustment’ analysed individual measures of individual differences like intelligence, cognitive reflection and basic personality traits to find the effect the anchoring bias had on individual decisions. Results found that there was a negative correlation between intelligence and anchoring in a group of more reflective subjects, indicating that individual differences in cognitive processing has important effects on the emergence of the anchoring effect. The experiment took 236 participants and graded cognitive attributes like intelligence, cognitive reflection and personality traits.

A further study completed by Adrian Furnham, Hua Chu Boo and Alistair McClelland asked participants to complete four anchoring tasks with each task consisting of a higher or lower anchor. The participants completed a personality test measuring cognitive processes as well as intelligence and individual determinants like extroversion and introversion. Furnham found that there was a relationship between high levels of conscientiousness and extraversion with anchoring biases.

Sebastian Schindler’s study which analysed the significance of  the anchoring effect against the 5 personality traits in a sample of 1000 participants found that there was evidence against the systematic influence of personality traits on the susceptibility towards the anchoring effect. All manipulations in the 1000 participant study shifted the median response towards the anchor and evidence against a systematic relationship.

=== Anchoring in pricing ===
According to the theory, consumers’ shopping experiences are influenced by factors such as time restriction and specific environment. Enterprises design would set anchor values for consumers in order to get them to buy the products. 
When persuading consumers to purchase a particular product, sellers might use anchoring. Sellers often influence consumers’ price perception by anchoring a high reference price and that is an anchor value. Following are three ways to set the anchor value for consumers.

==== Sorting the prices of products ====
Sellers usually sort the prices of products from high to low and this method is common seen on the menus of restaurants. The high prices at the top of the menu act as anchor values in this situation. Consumers will have an expectation that the products are all expensive when knowing the relatively high prices of products on the top of the list. As a result, they will be pleased to see the cheaper products at the middle and bottom of the list and regard these prices as acceptable or cheaper than expected. Therefore, they are more likely to buy these products.

==== Decoy ====
Decoy effect is defined as a situation where people tend to have a change in preference between two choices when they are showed with a third choice. The third choice is called a decoy which is designed to induce consumers to change their preferences. The decoy is usually considered as inferior. For example, it might be more expensive than option A while having lower quality than option B. In this case, the anchor is the decoy.

One decoy effect example is the bundle sales. For example, many restaurants often sell set meals to their consumers, while simultaneously having the meals’ components sold separately. The prices of the meals’ components are the decoy pricing and act as an anchor which enables to make the set meal more valuable to consumers. With the decoy effect it generates, the anchor increases consumers’ willingness to pay for the set meals, or the mixed bundles.

==== Incidental prices ====
Incidental price is defined as the prices offered or showed by a seller for products which the consumers are not interested in. According to the theory, the incidental price serves as an anchor which increases consumers’ willingness to pay. This effect has been widely used in areas such as auctions, online vendors and retailers.

<text>Juan Valera y Alcalá-Galiano (18 October 1824 – 18 April 1905) was a Spanish realist author, diplomat, and politician.

==Life==
He was born at Cabra, in the province of Córdoba, and was educated at Málaga and at the University of Granada, where he took his degree in law, and then entered upon a diplomatic career (1847). Over five decades, Valera filled a number of positions in a variety of places. He accompanied the Spanish Ambassador to Naples. Afterwards, he was a member of the Spanish legations at Lisbon (1850), Rio de Janeiro (1851–53), Dresden and St. Petersburg (1854–57 with the Duke of Osuna). He wrote about the latter mission in &quot;Cartas desde Rusia&quot;, poking &quot;gentle fun&quot; at his fellow diplomat, Mauricio Álvarez de las Asturias Bohorques y Guiráldez, the third Duke of Gor. After his return to Madrid, he became one of the editors of the liberal journal &quot;El Contemporáneo&quot; (1859), and was appointed Minister to Frankfurt (1865). After the revolution of 1868 he was appointed Assistant Secretary of State and (1871) Director of Public Instruction. During the reign of Alphonso XII he was Minister to Lisbon (1881–83), Washington (1883–86), and Brussels (1886–88), and in 1893-95 Ambassador to Vienna. He was elected to the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences in 1900.

Throughout his diplomatic and political activity he produced works which rank among the highest that his country&#x27;s literature contains. For purity of diction and beauty of style Valera has never been surpassed in Spain. &quot;Pepita Jiménez&quot;, which appeared as a serial in 1874, is probably his best known work; it has since been translated into many languages. It depicts the gradual realization by a young seminarian of the empty vanity of his vocation, culminating in a shattering denouement. Other novels are &#x27; (1875), &#x27; (1877), &#x27;, and &#x27; (1879). All of the foregoing novels were written around the time when he abandoned his political activities. He was also a supporter of Iberian Federalism.

<doc id="751111" wikidata="Q195199" url="?curid=751111" title="Joint Meritorious Unit Award">
<text>The Joint Meritorious Unit Award (JMUA) is a US military award that was established on June 4, 1981, by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and was implemented by Department of Defense Directive 1348.27 dated July 22, 1982. The Joint Meritorious Unit Award was made retroactive to January 23, 1979.

==History==
Authorized by the Secretary of Defense on June 10, 1981, this award was originally called the Department of Defense Meritorious Unit Award. It is awarded in the name of the Secretary of Defense to joint activities for meritorious achievement or service, superior to that which is normally expected, for actions in the following situations; combat with an armed enemy of the United States, a declared national emergency, or under extraordinary circumstances that involve national interests.

The first organization to receive the Joint Meritorious Unit Award was the &quot;Electronic Warfare During Close Air Support Joint Test Force&quot; and was awarded the decoration on September 30, 1982. The JMUA was also awarded to U.S. Marines and the U.S. Navy who served in Somalia in the early 1990s.

It was awarded for Operation Praying Mantis in 1988. Returning Navy units were to receive a Presidential Unit Citation, but it was downgraded after Iran Air Flight 655 was shot down by .

The Joint Meritorious Unit Award is a ribbon, enclosed in a gold frame. Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Space Force, and Coast Guard recipients wear a different, smaller frame than do U.S. Army, as the latters&#x27; unit awards are displayed at a different location on the uniform. The ribbon is very similar to the Defense Superior Service Medal, indicative of it signifying that the unit must have performed service of a character comparable to it, which, if performed by an individual, would warrant the award of the medal.

Subsequent decorations of the Joint Meritorious Unit Award are annotated with oak leaf clusters.

<doc id="751115" wikidata="Q656751" url="?curid=751115" title="Topographic prominence">
<text>In topography, prominence or relative height (also referred to as autonomous height, and shoulder drop in US English, and drop in British English) measures the height of a mountain or hill&#x27;s summit relative to the lowest contour line encircling it but containing no higher summit within it. It is a measure of the independence of a summit. The key col (&quot;saddle&quot;) around the peak is a unique point on this contour line and the &quot;parent peak&quot; is some higher mountain, selected according to various criteria.

==Definitions==
The prominence of a peak is the least drop in height necessary in order to get from the summit to any higher terrain. This can be calculated for a given peak in the following manner: for every path connecting the peak to higher terrain, find the lowest point on the path; the &quot;key col&quot; (or &quot;highest saddle&quot;, or &quot;linking col&quot;, or &quot;link&quot;) is defined as the highest of these points, along all connecting paths; the prominence is the difference between the elevation of the peak and the elevation of its key col. On a given landmass, the highest peak&#x27;s prominence will be identical to its elevation. An alternative equivalent definition is that the prominence is the height of the peak&#x27;s summit above the lowest contour line encircling it, but containing no higher summit within it; see Figure 1.

==Illustration==
The parent peak may be either close or far from the subject peak. The summit of Mount Everest is the parent peak of Aconcagua in Argentina at a distance of 17,755 km (11,032 miles), as well as the parent of the South Summit of Mount Everest at a distance of 360 m (1200 feet). The key col may also be close to the subject peak or far from it. The key col for Aconcagua, if sea level is disregarded, is the Bering Strait at a distance of 13,655 km (8,485 miles). The key col for the South Summit of Mount Everest is about 100 m (330 feet) distant.

A way to visualize prominence is to imagine raising sea level so the parent peak and subject peak are two separate islands. Then lower it until a tiny land bridge forms between the two islands. This land bridge is the key col of the subject peak, and the peak&#x27;s prominence is its elevation from that key col.

==In mountaineering==

Prominence is interesting to many mountaineers because it is an objective measurement that is strongly correlated with the subjective significance of a summit. Peaks with low prominence are either subsidiary tops of some higher summit or relatively insignificant independent summits. Peaks with high prominence tend to be the highest points around and are likely to have extraordinary views.

Only summits with a sufficient degree of prominence are regarded as independent mountains. For example, the world&#x27;s second-highest mountain is K2 (height 8,611 m, prominence 4,017 m). While Mount Everest&#x27;s South Summit (height 8,749 m, prominence 11 m) is taller than K2, it is not considered an independent mountain because it is a sub-summit of the main summit (which has a height and prominence of 8,848 m).

Many lists of mountains use topographic prominence as a criterion for inclusion in the list, or &quot;cutoff&quot;. John and Anne Nuttall&#x27;s &quot;The Mountains of England and Wales&quot; uses a cutoff of 15 m (about 50 ft), and Alan Dawson&#x27;s list of Marilyns uses 150 m (about 500 ft). (Dawson&#x27;s list and the term &quot;Marilyn&quot; are limited to Britain and Ireland). In the contiguous United States, the famous list of &quot;fourteeners&quot; (14,000 foot / 4268 m peaks) uses a cutoff of 300 ft / 91 m (with some exceptions). Also in the U.S., 2000 ft (610 m) of prominence has become an informal threshold that signifies that a peak has major stature.
Lists with a high topographic prominence cutoff tend to favor isolated peaks or those that are the highest point of their massif; a low value, such as the Nuttalls&#x27;, results in a list with many summits that may be viewed by some as insignificant.

While the use of prominence as a cutoff to form a list of peaks ranked by elevation is standard and is the most common use of the concept, it is also possible to use prominence as a mountain measure in itself. This generates lists of peaks ranked by prominence, which are qualitatively different from lists ranked by elevation. Such lists tend to emphasize isolated high peaks, such as range or island high points and stratovolcanoes. One advantage of a prominence-ranked list is that it needs no cutoff since a peak with high prominence is automatically an independent peak.

==Parent peak==

It is common to define a peak&#x27;s &quot;parent&quot; as a particular peak in the higher terrain connected to the peak by the key col. If there are many higher peaks there are various ways of defining which one is the parent, not necessarily based on geological or geomorphological factors. The &quot;parent&quot; relationship defines a hierarchy which defines some peaks as subpeaks of others. For example, in Figure 1, the middle peak is a subpeak of the right peak, which is a subpeak of the left peak, which is the highest point on its landmass. In that example, there is no controversy about the hierarchy; in practice, there are different definitions of parent. These different definitions follow.

===Encirclement or island parentage===
Also known as &quot;prominence island parentage&quot;, this is defined as follows. In Figure 2 the key col of peak A is at the meeting place of two closed contours, one encircling A (and no higher peaks) and the other containing at least one higher peak. The encirclement parent of A is the highest peak that is inside this other contour. In terms of the falling-sea model, the two contours together bound an &quot;island&quot;, with two pieces connected by an isthmus at the key col. The encirclement parent is the highest point on this entire island.

For example, the encirclement parent of Mont Blanc, the highest peak in the Alps, is Mount Everest. Mont Blanc&#x27;s key col is a piece of low ground near Lake Onega in northwestern Russia (at elevation), on the divide between lands draining into the Baltic and Caspian Seas. This is the meeting place of two contours, one of them encircling Mont Blanc; the other contour encircles Mount Everest. This example demonstrates that the encirclement parent can be very far away from the peak in question when the key col is low.
This means that, while simple to define, the encirclement parent often does not satisfy the intuitive requirement that the parent peak should be close to the child peak. For example, one common use of the concept of parent is to make clear the location of a peak. If we say that Peak A has Mont Blanc for a parent, we would expect to find Peak A somewhere close to Mont Blanc. This is not always the case for the various concepts of parent, and is least likely to be the case for encirclement parentage.

Figure 3 shows a schematic range of peaks with the color underlying the minor peaks indicating the encirclement parent. In this case the encirclement parent of M is H whereas an intuitive view might be that L was the parent. Indeed, if col &quot;k&quot; were slightly lower, L would be the true encirclement parent.

The encirclement parent is the highest possible parent for a peak; all other definitions indicate a (possibly different) peak on the combined island, a &quot;closer&quot; peak than the encirclement parent (if there is one), which is still &quot;better&quot; than the peak in question. The differences lie in what criteria are used to define &quot;closer&quot; and &quot;better.&quot;

===Prominence parentage===

The (prominence) parent peak of peak A can be found by dividing the island or region in question into territories, by tracing the two hydrographic runoffs, one in each direction, downwards from the key col of every peak that is more prominent than peak A. The parent is the peak whose territory peak A is in.

For hills with low prominence in Britain, a definition of &quot;parent Marilyn&quot; is sometimes used to classify low hills (&quot;Marilyn&quot; being a British term for a hill with a prominence of at least 150 m). This is found by dividing the region of Britain in question into territories, &quot;one for each Marilyn&quot;. The parent Marilyn is the Marilyn whose territory the hill&#x27;s summit is in. If the hill is on an island (in Britain) whose highest point is less than 150 m, it has no parent Marilyn.

Prominence parentage is the only definition used in the British Isles because encirclement parentage breaks down when the key col approaches sea level. Using the encirclement definition, the parent of almost any small hill in a low-lying coastal area would be Ben Nevis, an unhelpful and confusing outcome. Meanwhile, &quot;height&quot; parentage (see below) is not used because there is no obvious choice of cutoff.

This choice of method might at first seem arbitrary, but it provides every hill with a clear and unambiguous parent peak that is taller and more prominent than the hill itself, while also being connected to it (via ridge lines). The parent of a low hill will also usually be nearby; this becomes less likely as the hill&#x27;s height and prominence increase. Using prominence parentage, one may produce a &quot;hierarchy&quot; of peaks going back to the highest point on the island. One such chain in Britain would read:

Billinge Hill → Winter Hill → Hail Storm Hill → Boulsworth Hill → Kinder Scout → Cross Fell → Helvellyn → Scafell Pike → Snowdon → Ben Nevis.

At each stage in the chain, both height and prominence increase.

===Line parentage===

Line parentage, also called height parentage, is similar to prominence parentage, but it requires a prominence cutoff criterion. The height parent is the closest peak to peak A (along all ridges connected to A) that has a greater height than A, and satisfies some prominence criteria.

The disadvantage of this concept is that it goes against the intuition that a parent peak should always be more significant than its child. However it can be used to build an entire lineage for a peak which contains a great deal of information about the peak&#x27;s position.

In general, the analysis of parents and lineages is intimately linked to studying the topology of watersheds.

==Issues in choice of summit and key col==
Alteration of the landscape by humans and presence of water features can give rise to issues in the choice of location and height of a summit or col. In Britain, extensive discussion has resulted in a protocol that has been adopted by the main sources of prominence data in Britain and Ireland. Other sources of data commonly ignore human-made alterations, but this convention is not universally agreed upon; for example, some authors discount modern structures but allow ancient ones. Another disagreement concerns mountaintop removal, though for high-prominence peaks (and for low-prominence subpeaks with intact summits), the difference in prominence values for the two conventions is typically relatively small.

== Examples==

The key col and parent peak are often close to the sub-peak but this is not always the case, especially when the key col is relatively low. It is only with the advent of computer programs and geographical databases that thorough analysis has become possible.

For example, the key col of Denali in Alaska (6,194 m) is a 56 m col near Lake Nicaragua. Denali&#x27;s encirclement parent is Aconcagua (6,960 m), in Argentina, and its prominence is 6,138 m. (To further illustrate the rising-sea model of prominence, if sea level rose 56 m, North and South America would be separate continents and Denali would be 6138 m, its current prominence, above sea level. At a slightly lower level, the continents would still be connected and the high point of the combined landmass would be Aconcagua, the encirclement parent.) 

While it is natural for Aconcagua to be the parent of Denali, since Denali is a major peak, consider the following situation: Peak A is a small hill on the coast of Alaska, with elevation 100 m and key col 50 m. Then the encirclement parent of Peak A is also Aconcagua, even though there will be many peaks closer to Peak A which are much higher and more prominent than Peak A (for example, Denali). This illustrates the disadvantage in using the encirclement parent.

A hill in a low-lying area like the Netherlands will often be a direct child of Mount Everest, with its prominence about the same as its height and its key col placed at or near the foot of the hill, well below, for instance, the 113-meter-high key col of Mont Blanc.

==Calculations and mathematics==

When the key col for a peak is close to the peak itself, prominence is easily computed by hand using a topographic map. However, when the key col is far away, or when one wants to calculate the prominence of many peaks at once, software can apply surface network modeling to a digital elevation model to find exact or approximate key cols.

Since topographic maps typically show elevation using contour lines, the exact elevation is typically bounded by an upper and lower contour, and not specified exactly. Prominence calculations may use the high contour (giving in a pessimistic estimate), the low contour (giving an optimistic estimate), their mean (giving a &quot;midrange&quot; or &quot;rise&quot; prominence) or an interpolated value (customary in Britain).

The choice of method depends largely on the preference of the author and historical precedent. Pessimistic prominence, (and sometimes optimistic prominence) were for many years used in USA and international lists, but mean prominence is becoming preferred.

==Wet prominence and dry prominence==
There are two varieties of topographic prominence: wet prominence and dry prominence. Wet prominence is the standard topographic prominence discussed in this article. Wet prominence assumes that the surface of the earth includes all permanent water, snow, and ice features. Thus, the wet prominence of the highest summit of an ocean island or landmass is always equal to the summit&#x27;s elevation.

Dry prominence, on the other hand, ignores water, snow, and ice features and assumes that the surface of the earth is defined by the solid bottom of those features. The dry prominence of a summit is equal to its wet prominence unless the summit is the highest point of a landmass or island, or its key col is covered by snow or ice. If its highest surface col is on water, snow, or ice, the dry prominence of that summit is equal to its wet prominence plus the depth of its highest submerged col.

Because Earth has no higher summit than Mount Everest, Everest&#x27;s prominence is either undefined or its height from the lowest contour line. In a dry Earth, the lowest contour line would be the deepest hydrologic feature, the Challenger Deep, at 10,924 m depth. Everest&#x27;s dry prominence would be this depth plus Everest&#x27;s wet prominence of 8848 m, totaling 19,772 m. The dry prominence of Mauna Kea is equal to its wet prominence (4205 m) plus the depth of its highest submerged col (about 5125 m). Totaling 9330 m, this is greater than any mountain apart from Everest. The dry prominence of Aconcagua is equal to its wet prominence (6960 m) plus the depth of the highest submerged col of the Bering Strait (about 40 m), or about 7000 m.

Mauna Kea is relatively close to its submerged key col in the Pacific Ocean, and the corresponding contour line that surrounds Mauna Kea is a relatively compact area of the ocean floor. Whereas a contour line around Everest that is lower than 9330m from Everest&#x27;s peak would surround most of the major continents of the Earth. Even just surrounding Afro-Eurasia would run a contour line through the Bering Straight, with a highest submerged col of about 40 m, or only 8888 m below the peak of Everest. As a result, Mauna Kea&#x27;s prominence might be subjectively more impressive than Everest&#x27;s, and some authorities have called it the tallest mountain from peak to underwater base.

Dry prominence is also useful for measuring submerged seamounts. Seamounts have a dry topographic prominence, a topographic isolation, and a negative topographic elevation.

Prominence values are accurate to perhaps 100m owing to uncertainties in ocean sounding depths.

<text>Charles-Jean Étienne Gustave Nicolas, baron de la Vallée Poussin (; 14 August 1866 – 2 March 1962) was a Belgian mathematician. He is best known for proving the prime number theorem.

The King of Belgium ennobled him with the title of baron.

==Biography==
De la Vallée Poussin was born in Leuven, Belgium. He studied mathematics at the Catholic University of Leuven under his uncle Louis-Philippe Gilbert, after he had earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in engineering. De la Vallée Poussin was encouraged to study for a doctorate in physics and mathematics, and in 1891, at the age of just 25, he became an assistant professor in mathematical analysis.

De la Vallée Poussin became a professor at the same university (as was his father, Charles Louis de la Vallée Poussin, who taught mineralogy and geology) in 1892. De la Vallée Poussin was awarded with Gilbert&#x27;s chair when Gilbert died. While he was a professor there, de la Vallée Poussin carried out research in mathematical analysis and the theory of numbers, and in 1905 was awarded the Decennial Prize for Pure Mathematics 1894–1903. He was awarded this prize a second time in 1924 for his work during 1914–23.

In 1898, de la Vallée Poussin was appointed as the correspondent to the Royal Belgian Academy of Sciences, and he became a Member of the Academy in 1908. In 1923, he became the President of the Division of Sciences.

In August 1914, de la Vallée Poussin escaped from Leuven at the time of its destruction by the invading German Army of World War I, and he was invited to teach at Harvard University in the United States. He accepted this invitation. In 1918, de la Vallée Poussin returned to Europe to accept professorships in Paris at the Collège de France and at the Sorbonne.

After the war was over, de la Vallée Poussin returned to Belgium, The International Union of Mathematicians was created, and he was invited to become its President. Between 1918 and 1925, de la Vallée Poussin traveled extensively, lecturing in Geneva, Strasbourg, and Madrid. and then in the United States where he gave lectures at the Universities of Chicago, California, Pennsylvania, and Brown University, Yale University, Princeton University, Columbia University, and the Rice Institute of Houston.

He was awarded the &quot;Prix Poncelet&quot; for 1916. De la Vallée Poussin was given the titles of Doctor Honoris Causa of the Universities of Paris, Toronto, Strasbourg, and Oslo, an Associate of the Institute of France, and a Member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Nazionale dei Lincei, Madrid, Naples, Boston. He was awarded the title of Baron by King Albert I of the Belgians in 1928.

In 1961, de la Vallée Poussin fractured his shoulder, and this accident and its complications led to his death in Watermael-Boitsfort, near Brussels, Belgium, a few months later.

A student of his, Georges Lemaître, was the first to propose the Big Bang theory of the formation of the Universe.

==Work==
Although his first mathematical interests were in analysis, he became suddenly famous as he proved the prime number theorem independently of his coeval Jacques Hadamard in 1896.

Afterwards, he found interest in approximation theory. He defined, for any continuous function &quot;f&quot; on the standard interval formula_1, the sums
:formula_2,

where
:formula_3

and
:formula_4

are the vectors of the dual basis with respect to the basis of Chebyshev polynomials (defined as
:formula_5

Note that the formula is also valid with formula_6 being the Fourier sum of a formula_7-periodic function formula_8 such that
:formula_9

Finally, the de la Vallée Poussin sums can be evaluated in terms of the so-called Fejér sums (say formula_10)
:formula_11
The kernel is bounded (formula_12) and obeys the property
:formula_13, if formula_14

Later, he worked on potential theory and complex analysis.
He also published a counterexample to Alfred Kempe&#x27;s false proof of the four color theorem. The Poussin graph, the graph he used for this counterexample, is named after him.

== &quot;Cours d’analyse&quot; ==
The textbooks of his mathematical analysis course have been a reference for a long time and had some international influence.

The second edition (1909-1912) is remarkable for its introduction of the Lebesgue integral. It was in 1912, &quot;the only textbook on analysis containing both Lebesgue integral and its application to Fourier series, and a general theory of approximation of functions by polynomials&quot;.

The third edition (1914) introduced the now classical definition of differentiability due to Otto Stolz. The second volume of this third edition was burnt in the fire of Louvain during the German invasion.

The further editions were much more conservative, returning essentially to the first edition. Starting from the eighth edition, Fernand Simonart took over the revision and the publication of the &quot;Cours d’analyse.&quot;

<text>Leonardo Tremayne Carson (born February 11, 1977) is an American former professional football defensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Diego Chargers and Dallas Cowboys. He played college football at Auburn University.

==Early life==
Carson attended Shaw High School in Mobile, Alabama. He played five different positions (linebacker, tight end, fullback, wide receiver and quarterback) and was the starting quarterback in his last 2 years. As a senior, he recorded 934 passing yards for 7 touchdowns, 1,104 rushing yards for 12 touchdowns, receiving All-state and All-American honors.

==College career==
He accepted a football scholarship from Auburn University with the intention of playing tight end. In July 1996, he was sentenced to 60 days in jail, for his role in the break-in of a car in March, but was able to be placed on probation and serve only 6 days.

Carson was converted into a defensive tackle as a true freshman, before being moved to defensive end when Shannon Shuttle was lost for the year. He started the last 4 games of the season, while registering 32 tackles (2 for loss), 4.5 sacks and 2 fumble recoveries.

As a sophomore, he started 13 games, tallying 59 tackles (9 for loss), 2 sacks, 2 passes defensed, 2 forced fumbles and one fumble recovery. As a junior, he posted 90 tackles (8 for loss), 8.5 sacks, one interception, 2 passes defensed, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery.

His stats were impacted in his last season when he was moved to defensive tackle, tallying 43 tackles (28 for loss), 2 sacks, one interception and one forced fumble. He finished his career with 224 tackles (47 for loss), 17 sacks, 4 passes defensed, 2 interceptions, 4 forced fumbles and 4 fumble recoveries.

==Professional career==
===San Diego Chargers===
Carson was selected by the San Diego Chargers in the fourth round (113th overall) of the 2000 NFL draft. As a rookie, he appeared in 4 of the first 10 games, making 2 tackles. On November 17, he was placed on the injured reserve list with a tore right rotator cuff.

In 2001, he started 13 games at defensive tackle, after replacing Jamal Williams who tore the ACL in his left knee. He posted 33 tackles, 3 sacks, 3 passes defensed and 2 fumble recoveries.

In 2002, he began the season as a backup, but started the last 6 games after Williams suffered a season-ending ankle injury, posting 31 tackles, 3.5 sacks, 3 passes defensed and one fumble recovery.

On August 21, 2003, he was arrested for breaking into an apartment and was later sued on September 30. He appeared in 5 games as a backup defensive tackle, making 2 tackles and one pass defensed. He was waived on October 14.

===Dallas Cowboys===
On October 18, 2003, he was signed as a free agent by the Dallas Cowboys. He was a backup defensive tackle, registering 21 tackles (1 for loss), 1.5 sacks and 2 quarterback pressures. He tore his right triceps muscle against the Washington Redskins and was placed on the injured reserve list on December 16.

Carson was re-signed for the 2004 season, although he served 8 days in jail in June and was suspended for the opening game by the NFL for his previous legal problems and the violation of the player conduct policy. He passed Willie Blade on the depth chart and started 15 games alongside Pro Bowler La&#x27;Roi Glover. He posted 55 tackles (seventh on the team), 5 tackles for loss (tied for the team lead), 8 quarterback pressures, one fumble recovery and a half sack.

Although large and physically talented, his productivity as a player was often average, and head coach Bill Parcells, who initially lauded his arrival to the team, stated in several press conferences that he&#x27;d lost confidence in Carson.

He signed a one-year contract with the Cowboys for the 2005 season, but was released on September 1, after being passed on the depth chart by rookie Jay Ratliff.

==NFL career statistics==


==Personal life==
Beginning June 14, 2004, Carson began serving a 30-day sentence at the Mobile County Metro Jail on two misdemeanor counts of kidnapping and burglary relating to an August 2003 incident where he broke into the home of his ex-girlfriend&#x27;s sister, Tasha Locke. He forced her to leave with him, but later that evening, Carson&#x27;s car broke down, and Locke escaped.

In June 2010, Carson was sentenced to ten years in prison for selling drugs, while living in Mobile, Alabama.

<doc id="751124" wikidata="Q629133" url="?curid=751124" title="Argentine Chamber of Deputies">
<text>The Chamber of Deputies (), officially the Honorable Chamber of Deputies of the Argentine Nation, is the lower house of the Argentine National Congress (). It is made up of 257 national deputies who are elected in multi-member constituencies corresponding with the territories of the 23 provinces of Argentina (plus the Federal Capital) by party list proportional representation. Elections to the Chamber are held every two years, so that half of its members are up in each election, making it a rare example of staggered elections used in a lower house.

The Constitution of Argentina lays out certain attributions that are unique to the Chamber of Deputies. The Chamber holds exclusive rights to levy taxes; to draft troops; and to accuse the president, cabinet ministers, and members of the Supreme Court before the Senate. Additionally, the Chamber of Deputies receives for consideration bills presented by popular initiative.

The Chamber of Deputies is presided over by the president of the Chamber (), who is deputized by three vice presidents. All of them are elected by the chamber itself.

==Current composition==
It has 257 seats and one-half of the members are elected every two years to serve four-year terms by the people of each district (23 provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires) using proportional representation (list PR), D&#x27;Hondt formula with a 3% of the district registered voters threshold, and the following distribution:

=== By province ===
=== By political groups ===

127 of the current members of the Chamber of Deputies for the 2023–2025 period were elected in the 2021, while the remaining 130 were elected in 2023 legislative election. The governing La Libertad Avanza alliance, to which President Javier Milei belongs, is the second largest parliamentary bloc with 38 deputies, while the main opposition, Union for the Homeland, holds the first minority with 99 deputies.

== Requirements ==
Individuals elected to congress must be at least twenty five years old with at least four years of active citizenship and it has to be naturalized in the province that is being elected to or at least have two years of immediate residency in said province. (Art. 48 of the Argentine Constitution).

==History==
The Chamber of Deputies was provided for in the Constitution of Argentina, ratified on May 1, 1853. Eligibility requisites are that members be at least twenty-five years old, and have been a resident of the province they represent for at least two years; as congressional seats are elected at-large, members nominally represent their province, rather than a district.

Otherwise patterned after Article One of the United States Constitution per legal scholar Juan Bautista Alberdi&#x27;s treatise, &quot;Bases de la Constitución Argentina&quot;, the chamber was originally apportioned in one seat per 33,000 inhabitants. The constitution made no provision for a national census, however, and because the Argentine population doubled every twenty years from 1870 to 1930 as a result of immigration (disproportionately benefiting Buenos Aires and the Pampas area provinces), censuses were conducted generationally, rather than every decade, until 1947.

===Apportionment controversy===
The distribution of the Chamber of Deputies is regulated since 1982 by Law 22.847, also called &quot;Ley Bignone&quot;, enacted by the last Argentine dictator, General Reynaldo Bignone, ahead of the 1983 general elections. This law established that, initially, each province shall have one deputy per 161,000 inhabitants, with standard rounding; after this is calculated, each province is granted three more deputies. If a province has fewer than five deputies, the number of deputies for that province is increased to reach that minimum.

Controversially, apportionment remains based on the 1980 population census, and has not been modified since 1983; national censuses since then have been conducted in 1991, 2001, 2010, and 2022. The minimum of five seat per province allots the smaller ones a disproportionately large representation, as well. Accordingly, this distribution does not reflect Argentina&#x27;s current population balance.

==Presidents of the Chamber==

The president of the Chamber is elected by a majority of the Chamber&#x27;s members. Traditionally, the presidency is held by a member of the party or alliance of the national executive, though exceptions have occurred, such as in 2001, when the Peronist Eduardo Camaño was elected president of the Chamber during the presidency of the radical Fernando de la Rúa. The officeholders for this post since 1983 have been:

<doc id="751139" wikidata="Q707507" url="?curid=751139" title="Yoshitoshi Abe">
<text>, also stylized as yoshitoshi ABe, is a Japanese graphic artist who works predominantly in anime and manga. He first gained fame for his work on the avant-garde anime &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot;. He is also responsible for the concept and character design for the series &quot;NieA_7&quot;. He is the creator of the dōjinshi &quot;Haibane Renmei&quot;, which was also adapted into an anime.

He is a colleague and friend of Chiaki J. Konaka, with whom he collaborated on the series &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot; and &quot;Texhnolyze&quot;. He usually uses the romaji form of his name instead of the kanji, with the &quot;B&quot; in &quot;ABe&quot; capitalized, as a reminder of his early works, for which he used the pen name &quot;AB&quot;.

Abe began his career as a teen in Tokyo and was first recognized as a graffiti artist, who regularly got into legal problems with his art. His concepts for all his later works are said to be inspired by this time of his life and has projected a dark theme into his anime character designs.

He is known to be a fairly tech-savvy manga artist, drawing a sketch with just his finger and an application on an iPad. He released self-published &quot;dōjinshi&quot; on digital support bypassing the traditional print publishers with &quot;Pochiyama at the Pharmacy&quot; in 2008 aimed at iPhone and iPod Touch and &quot;I am an Alien, I have a Question&quot; in 2010 for Kindle.

==Personal life==
On November 11, 2011, Abe married artist Sasaki Yukari, his manga assistant since 2010. Their daughter was born on September 21, 2012.

<text>Colorado Desert is a part of the larger Sonoran Desert located in California, United States, and Baja California, Mexico. It encompasses approximately , including the heavily irrigated Coachella, Imperial and Mexicali valleys. It is home to many unique flora and fauna.

==Geography and geology==
The Colorado Desert is a subregion of the larger Sonoran Desert, covering about . The desert occupies Imperial County, parts of San Diego and Riverside counties, and a small part of San Bernardino County in California, United States, as well as the northern part of Mexicali Municipality in Baja California, Mexico.

Most of the Colorado Desert lies at a relatively low elevation, below , with the lowest point of the desert floor at below sea level, at the Salton Sea. Although the highest peaks of the Peninsular Ranges reach elevations of nearly , most of the region&#x27;s mountains do not exceed .

In this region, the geology is dominated by the transition of the tectonic plate boundary from rift to fault. The southernmost strands of the San Andreas Fault connect to the northernmost extensions of the East Pacific Rise. Consequently, the region is subject to earthquakes, and the crust is being stretched, which will result in a sinking of the terrain over time.

==Climate==
The Colorado Desert&#x27;s climate distinguishes it from other deserts. The region experiences greater summer daytime temperatures than higher-elevation deserts and almost never experiences frost. In addition, the Colorado Desert experiences two rainy seasons per year (in the winter and late summer), especially toward the southern portion of the region; the more northerly Mojave Desert usually has only winter rains.

The west coast Peninsular Ranges, or other west ranges, of Southern California–northern Baja California, block most eastern Pacific coastal air and rains, producing an arid climate. Other short or longer-term weather events can move in from the Gulf of California to the south, and are often active in the summer monsoons. These include remnants of Pacific hurricanes, storms from the southern tropical jetstream, and the northern Intertropical Convergence Zone.

==Flora and fauna==

The region&#x27;s terrestrial habitats include creosote bush scrub; mixed scrub, including yucca and cholla cactus; desert saltbush; sandy soil grasslands; and desert dunes. Higher elevations are dominated by pinyon pine and California juniper, with areas of manzanita and Coulter pine. In addition to hardy perennials, more than half of the desert&#x27;s plant species are herbaceous annuals, and appropriately timed winter rains produce abundant early spring wildflowers. In the southern portion of the region, the additional moisture supplied by summer rainfall fosters the germination of summer annual plants and supports smoketree, ironwood, and palo verde trees.

Common desert wildlife include mule deer, bobcat, desert kangaroo rat, cactus mouse, black-tailed jackrabbit, Gambel&#x27;s quail, and red-diamond rattlesnake. Among sensitive species are flat-tailed horned lizard, Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizard, desert tortoise, prairie falcon, Andrews&#x27; dune scarab beetle, peninsular bighorn sheep, and California leaf-nosed bat. The best place to spot wildlife is at the wetland refuges along the Colorado River, Cibola National Wildlife Refuge and Imperial National Wildlife Refuge.

In the Colorado Desert&#x27;s arid environment, aquatic and wetland habitats are limited in extent but are critically important to wildlife. Runoff from seasonal rains and groundwater springs forms desert arroyos, desert fan palm oases, freshwater marshes, brine lakes, desert washes, ephemeral and perennial streams, and desert riparian vegetation communities dominated by cottonwood, willow, and non-native tamarisk. Two of the region&#x27;s most significant aquatic systems are the Salton Sea and the Colorado River. While most desert wildlife depend on aquatic habitats as water sources, a number of species, such as the arroyo toad, desert pupfish, Yuma rail, and southwestern willow flycatcher, are restricted to these habitats. In some places, summer rains produce short-lived seasonal pools that host uncommon species like Couch&#x27;s spadefoot toad.
Desert fan palm oases are rare ecological communities found only in the Colorado Desert. They occur only where permanent water sources are available, such as at springs or along fault lines, where groundwater is forced to the surface by the movement of hard impermeable rock, and can be found in the San Jacinto, Santa Rosa, and Little San Bernardino mountains, in the canyons of Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, and along the San Andreas Fault in the Coachella Valley. The only palm native to California, &quot;Washingtonia filifera&quot; (desert fan palm), grows at the oases.

===Endemic flora===
Some sub-regions of the Colorado Desert contain endemic flora. Along the Lower Colorado River Valley, in-flow side canyons, flatlands, or low-to-higher level elevations, at least one such plants occur: &quot;Salvia greatae&quot; (Orocopia sage).

==Environmental issues==
The Colorado Desert is one of the least-populous regions in California, but human activities have had substantial impacts on the region&#x27;s habitats and wildlife. Many unique communities, particularly aquatic and dune systems, are limited in distribution and separated by vast expanses of inhospitable, arid desert terrain. Even limited human disturbances can have markedly deleterious effects on the endemic and sensitive species supported by these unique regional systems.

Some of the greatest human-caused effects on the region have resulted from the water diversions and flood control measures along the Colorado River. These measures have dramatically altered the region&#x27;s hydrology by redistributing the region&#x27;s water supply to large expanses of irrigated agriculture and metropolitan coastal areas such as Los Angeles and San Diego. The once-dynamic Salton Sea and Colorado River ecosystems are now controlled by human water management. Because of the scarcity of water resources in the desert environment, these alterations have had substantial impacts on regional wildlife and habitats. In addition, portions of the region are experiencing substantial growth and development pressures, most notably the Coachella Valley.

<text>The Honorable Senate of the Argentine Nation () is the upper house of the National Congress of Argentina.

==Overview==
The National Senate was established by the Argentine Confederation on July 29, 1854, pursuant to Articles 46 to 54 of the 1853 Constitution. There are 72 members: three for each province and three for the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. The number of senators per province was raised from two to three following the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution as well as the addition of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires&#x27; senators. Those changes took effect following the May 14, 1995, general elections.

Senators are elected to six-year terms by direct election on a provincial basis, with the party with the most votes being awarded two of the province&#x27;s senate seats and the second-place party receiving the third seat. Historically, senators were indirectly elected to nine-year terms by each provincial legislature. These provisions were abolished in the 1994 constitutional amendment, and the first direct elections to the Senate took effect in 2001. Currently one-third of the members are elected every two years; there are no term limits.

The vice president of the republic is &quot;ex officio&quot; president of the Senate, with a casting vote in the event of a tie. In practice, the provisional president presides over the chamber most of the time.

The Senate must obtain quorum to deliberate, this being an absolute majority. It has the power to approve bills passed by the Chamber of Deputies, call for joint sessions with the lower house or special sessions with experts and interested parties, and submit bills for the president&#x27;s signature; bills introduced in the Senate must, in turn, be approved by the Chamber of Deputies for their submission to the president. The Senate must introduce any changes to federal revenue sharing policies, ratify international treaties, approve changes to constitutional or federal criminal laws, as well as confirm or impeach presidential nominees to the cabinet, the judiciary, the armed forces, and the diplomatic corps, among other federal posts.

There are twenty-four standing committees made up of
fifteen members each, namely:

*Agreements (confirmation of federal nominees)
*Constitutional Affairs
*Foreign Affairs and Worship
*Justice and Criminal Affairs
*General Legislation
*Budget and Finance
*Administrative and Municipal Affairs
*National Defense
*Domestic Security and Drug Trafficking
*National Economy and Investment
*Industry and Trade
*Regional Economies, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises
*Labor and Social Security
*Agriculture, Cattle Raising and Fishing
*Education, Culture, Science and Technology
*Rights and Guarantees
*Mining, Energy and Fuels
*Health and Sports
*Infrastructure, Housing and Transport
*Systems, Media and Freedom of Speech
*Environment and Human Development
*Population and Human Development
*Federal Revenue Sharing

<doc id="751182" wikidata="Q7191691" url="?curid=751182" title="Pier 1 Imports">
<text>Pier 1 Imports, Inc., is an online retailer and former Fort Worth, Texas-based retail chain specializing in imported home furnishings and decor, particularly furniture, table-top items, decorative accessories, and seasonal decor. It was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker PIR. In January 2020, Pier 1 had over 1,000 physical stores throughout the United States and Canada. Pier 1 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on February 17, 2020, and on May 19, 2020, announced it was asking the bankruptcy court to close all stores, due in large part to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In July 2020, Retail ECommerce Ventures (REV) bought the rights to Pier 1 and planned to revive the brand as an ecommerce store.

At the end of October 2020, Pier 1 Imports closed its remaining stores and transferred its website to REV, which is doing business as Dallas-based Pier 1 Imports Online, Inc.

== History ==
In 1962, Charles D. Tandy and Luther Henderson of the Tandy Corporation provided a loan to the California-based Cost Plus Imports chain in exchange for franchise rights. Their first franchised location opened that year in San Mateo. By 1966, Tandy&#x27;s and Henderson&#x27;s franchises had grown to 16 locations in California and Texas. They rebranded their stores Pier 1 Imports, establishing a new corporate headquarters with Radio Shack, another Tandy holding, in Fort Worth, Texas.

Pier 1 went public on the American Stock Exchange in 1970 and later joined the New York Stock Exchange in 1972. At this time, the company had grown to 123 stores, posted 100 percent sales gains for four consecutive years, and opened stores internationally in Australia and Europe. A Pier 1 store in Royal Oak, Michigan, reached annual sales of $1 million in 1979. By 1985, the Pier 1 chain grew to 265 stores, with the management goal of doubling that number by 1990.

Pier 1 had a presence in the Greater Tokyo Area of Japan from April 1996 to early 2002, and its franchised stores were operated by Akatsuki Printing Co. There were 5 stores by early 1997, 16 by fiscal 1998, and 18 by fiscal 1999, but that number shrunk to just 9 by early 2000.

On December 29, 2006, Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s bumped Pier 1 Imports Inc. down one spot and off the bottom of the S&amp;P MidCap 400 Index when it added Parametric Technology, a software company. As of December 2012, the company had sales of $418 million.

In April 2008, Pier 1 sold its headquarters building for $104 million.

In May 2017, Alasdair James became CEO following Alex Smith&#x27;s departure in December 2016. In December 2018, Alasdair James was replaced by veteran CEO Cheryl Bachelder. Bachelder is served as interim CEO until the former Pier 1 CFO, Robert Riesbeck took over in November 2019.

On January 6, 2020, it was announced that Pier 1 will close up to 450 stores, citing &quot;a reduction in corporate headcount&quot;.

On February 17, 2020, Pier 1 Imports, Inc. and seven affiliated companies filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. As part of the filing, the company is closing all their stores in Canada.

On May 19, 2020, Pier 1 Imports announced that it is asking the bankruptcy court to close all stores, due in large part to the COVID-19 pandemic and failing to find a buyer. On May 30, it was announced that Pier 1 Imports had received court approval to liquidate all locations. Pier 1 announced that they plan to close all stores by the end of October 2020.

In June 2020, Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV) acquired Pier 1 for $31 million. REV, which was founded by former NASA scientist Alex Mehr and serial entrepreneur Tai Lopez, is a holding company that buys distressed iconic brands and revives them as e-commerce businesses. Other recent acquisitions of REV include Dressbarn and Modell&#x27;s Sporting Goods. REV acquired control of the Pier 1 website at the end of October 2020, just about the time the last store had closed, and moved on-line operations to Dallas.

On March 2, 2023, Retail Ecommerce Ventures, Pier 1 Imports&#x27; current parent, announced that it was mulling a possible bankruptcy filing.

==Merchandise==
Pier 1 merchandise consists of home furnishings and accessories such as candles, vases, and picture frames as well as full-sized upholstered furniture, hand-carved armoires, large-scale vases and eclectic wall décor. Items are imported, created in conjunction with foreign designers, or produced by Pier 1&#x27;s Trend and Product Development team.

== Partnerships ==
Pier 1 became a corporate partner of the U.S. Fund for UNICEF since 1985, its longest-running corporate partnership. As of 2013, this partnership had generated more than $42 million by selling UNICEF greeting cards, cause marketing, and emergency relief for Afghanistan, Haiti, and Iraq, as well as areas affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami.

Former spokespeople for the company, seen largely in broadcast commercials, include &quot;Cheers&quot; alumna Kirstie Alley and Thom Filicia of &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot;.

<text>Sir Jeremy Quentin Greenstock (born 27 July 1943) is a British retired diplomat, active from 1969 to 2004.

==Life and career==
Greenstock was educated at Harrow School and at Worcester College, Oxford. He was an assistant master at Eton College from 1966 to 1969. Greenstock joined the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 1969 and served until 2004. He served in the British embassies in Washington, D.C., Paris, Dubai and Saudi Arabia.

===United Nations work===
Greenstock was the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the United Nations for five years, from 1998 to July 2003 where he attended over 150 meetings of the United Nations Security Council. From October 2001 to April 2003, he was Chairman of the Security Council&#x27;s Counter-Terrorism Committee.

In 2003 he acted as the head of a Security Council mission to West Africa to assess the UN activities there, including the work of United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone.

===Iraq and aftermath===
In September 2003, Greenstock was appointed the UK&#x27;s Special Representative for Iraq, where he worked alongside Paul Bremer within the Coalition Provisional Authority.

Greenstock left his position in Baghdad in March 2004, on a timing agreed with the UK government.

Greenstock wrote a book about his role in the Iraq war that was expected to be released in autumn 2005, but was withdrawn from publication at the request of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Greenstock appeared on the &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; talk show on 14 May 2008 and explained some of the contents of his book. During the interview he stated categorically that British and American leaders had known since 1998 that Iraq under Saddam Hussein had no nuclear weapon capabilities or programs.

On 27 November and 15 December 2009, Greenstock gave evidence to the Iraq Inquiry regarding his time as ambassador to the United Nations.

===Post retirement===
After leaving the diplomatic service, Greenstock held numerous positions. He was the Director of the Ditchley Foundation until August 2010 and a Special Adviser to BP from July 2004 to June 2010. Currently he is the Chairman of the United Nations Association of the UK, as well as the Chairman of Gatehouse Advisory Partners and of Lambert Energy Advisory Ltd. He is an advisor to the International Rescue Committee-UK and to the NGO Forward Thinking, and a non-executive director of De La Rue. 

He has three children - Katie, Nick, and Alexandra.

From 2007 until 2019 he was King of Arms of the Order of St Michael and St George, the order&#x27;s herald.

&quot;Iraq: The Cost of War&quot; – Greenstock&#x27;s diary of events leading up to, during, and after the Iraq War, which was banned from publication in 2005 after an intervention by then Foreign Secretary Jack Straw – was published in 2016.

<text>Antonio Pacinotti (17 June 1841 – 24 March 1912) was an Italian physicist, who was Professor of Physics at the University of Pisa.

==Biography==
Pacinotti was born in Pisa, where he also died. He was the son of Luigi Pacinotti and Caterina Catanti, attended the &quot;istituto arcivescovile Santa Caterina&quot;, and took part in the second war of Italian independence as &quot;sergente volontario&quot;. He was a student of Carlo Matteucci and graduated in mathematics at Pisa under Riccardo Felici. He was appointed as assistant to the astronomer Giovanni Battista Donati in 1862, professor at the technological institute of Bologna in 1864, professor of physics at the University of Cagliari in 1873, and, finally, successor to his father in 1881 in the chair of technological physics at the University of Pisa. Among his students was Augusto Righi.

Pacinotti died in Pisa.

==Scientific studies and invention of the dynamo==
He is best known for inventing an improved form of direct-current electrical generator, or dynamo, which he built in 1860 and described in a paper published in &quot;Il Nuovo Cimento&quot; of 1865. It used a ring armature around which was wrapped a coil of wire, to produce a smoother current than that available from previous types of dynamo. He found that the device could also be used as an electric motor.

In July 1862, Pacinotti was one of several independent discoverers of the comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle.

Lungarno Pacinotti, an embankment of the Arno River in Pisa, is named after him.

<text>Habanero-tan () is the unofficial mascot of Bōkun Habanero, the habanero pepper-flavored snacks produced by Tohato. Habanero-tan and her companions with names like &quot;Jalapeño-san&quot; are the personification of spices as cute young girls. They were created by several Japanese amateur artists, and of them, Takehiro &quot;Shigatake&quot; Shiga, the creator of the character Habanero-tan, drew a series of &quot;yonkoma&quot; manga featuring the lives of these girls. Shiga later became the graphics designer for the Vanillaware games &quot;Odin Sphere&quot; and &quot;GrimGrimoire&quot;.

Habanero-tan&#x27;s popularity has led to various renditions (some of them risque) by other Japanese artists, and even appearances on the OVA &quot;Netrun-mon&quot;. There is also a &quot;dōjin&quot; game called &quot;Habanero-tan House&quot; which incorporates many of the things seen in Shigatake&#x27;s comics. The game&#x27;s creator, Ashinaga Oji-san, later worked with Shiga and Vanillaware to develop a similar game called &quot;Kumatanchi&quot; for the Nintendo DS.

<text>The Hawaii State Department of Education (HIDOE, ) is a statewide public education system in the United States. The school district can be thought of as analogous to the school districts of other cities and communities in the United States, but in some manners can also be thought of as analogous to the state education agencies of other states. As the official state education agency, the Hawaii State Department of Education oversees all 258 public schools and 37 charter schools and over 13,000 teachers in the State of Hawaii, serving approximately 167,649 students statewide (School Year 2023-24). The U.S. Census Bureau classifies this as a &quot;dependent school system&quot;, that is dependent on the Hawaiian state government.

The HIDOE is currently headed by Superintendent Keith Hayashi (since July 1, 2022). The department is headquartered in the Queen Liliuokalani Building in Honolulu CDP, City and County of Honolulu on the island of Oahu.

Hawaii is the only state in the nation that does not use property tax revenue to fund public education; instead, most of HIDOE&#x27;s budget is funded from the state general fund which includes revenue from the general excise tax and income taxes. Hawaii&#x27;s overall level of property tax is the lowest nationwide. There had been a law to allow for locally operated government schools, but the law was rescinded. The term &quot;school districts&quot; in Hawaii is instead used to refer to internal divisions within HIDOE, and the U.S. Census Bureau does not count these as local governments.

==History==
Kamehameha III established Hawaii&#x27;s first public education system on October 15, 1840. This makes the Hawaii State Department of Education the oldest school system in the US west of the Mississippi River, and the only system established by a sovereign monarch. This date denotes when the constitution came into effect, codifying the new ministry of education. The regent of Kamehameha III, Queen Emma, had ordered the establishment of free public schools in all districts in 1834 and this was done by 1836.

In October 2009, the Hawaii Department of Education agreed to a furlough program for Hawaii&#x27;s public schools that reduced the number of instructional days by 17 days to a total of 163 days. This is the smallest number of instructional days anywhere in the United States.

==Board of education==
The board of education members are appointed by the governor of Hawaii with the advice and consent of the Hawaii State Senate. This is in contrast to most other school districts in the United States which are directly elected. Hawaii previously had an elected school board from 1966 until 2010 when voters decided to switch back to an appointed state school board. Members are appointed for three-year terms for a maximum of three terms.

The Board of Education is empowered by the State Constitution (Article X, Section 3) to formulate statewide education policy. The Board also has the power to appoint the Superintendent of Education, the State Librarian, and members of the State Public Charter School Commission.

There are nine voting members:
* (1) Chairperson, At Large
* (2) Members, At-Large
* (3) Members, City and County of Honolulu
* (1) Member, Hawai&#x27;i County
* (1) Member, Kaua&#x27;i County
* (1) Member, Maui County

The board also includes a non-voting public high school student member and a non-voting military representative, for a total of eleven members.

The State Department of Education currently carries suggested benchmarks for each educational grade and subject which are available on its website. However, a law creating a standard state public school curriculum, the first of its kind in Hawaii, did not pass during the 2006 legislative session.

==Relevant debates==
Probably the most current and controversial debate over Hawaii school reform has to do with the structure of the State Department of Education: specifically, whether it should remain centralized or be broken into smaller districts. The main rationale usually given for the current centralized model is equity in distribution of resources: all schools are theoretically funded from the same pool of money on an equitable basis. (Most schools on the U.S. Mainland are organized into school districts funded from local property taxes; thus, more affluent school districts theoretically receive more money and resources than less affluent areas.) Supporters of decentralization see it as a means of moving decision-making closer to the classroom, and thus achieving better student performance.

The debate divides roughly along party lines, with Republicans generally supporting decentralization and the Democrats supporting the centralized status quo. In 2002, Republican Governor Linda Lingle ran on a campaign to reorganize the Hawaii State Department of Education into smaller school districts that were localed modeled after a system found in Canada. The Democrat-controlled Hawaii State Legislature, however, voted not to enact this plan in 2003 and 2004.

==Structure==
The department serves as the single school district for the entire State of Hawaii.

The statewide system is divided into seven Districts, with each District subdivided into Complex Areas; each Complex Area including at least one Complex; and each Complex comprising high schools and the middle and elementary schools that feed into them. These are the Districts and Complex Areas:

*Honolulu District:
**Farrington-Kaiser-Kalani Complex Area 
**Kaimuki-McKinley-Roosevelt Complex Area
*Central District:
**Aiea-Moanalua-Radford Complex Area
**Leilehua-Mililani-Waialua Complex Area
*Leeward District:
**Campbell-Kapolei Complex Area
**Pearl City-Waipahu Complex Area
**Nanakuli-Waianae Complex Area
*Windward District:
**Castle-Kahuku Complex Area
**Kailua-Kalaheo Complex Area
*Hawaii District:
**Hilo-Waiakea Complex Area
**Kau-Keaau-Pahoa Complex Area
**Honokaa-Kealakehe-Kohala-Konawaena Complex Area
*Maui District:
**Baldwin-Kekaulike-Kulanihakoi-Maui Complex Area
**Hana-Lahainaluna-Lanai-Molokai Complex Area
*Kauai District:
**Kapaa-Kauai-Waimea Complex Area

=== Learning Centers ===
The Hawaii Department of Education offers Learning Centers within the public school system. Similar to magnet schools, Learning Centers are after school programs dedicated to a particular interest of study, and vary between school to school. Students who are enrolled in public school are allowed to enroll at any learning center. Themes include agriculture, technology, science, performing arts, and business.

Salah Mesbah Khalaf (), also known as Abu Iyad () (31 August 1933 – 14 January 1991), was a Palestinian militant and the deputy chief and head of intelligence for the Palestine Liberation Organization. He was the second most senior official of Fatah after Yasser Arafat.

The United States and Israel believed him to have been a founder of the Black September Organization. 

Suspected of having helped the CIA to break up Abu Nidal&#x27;s so-called &quot;Abu Nidal Organization&quot;, Khalaf was assassinated by a member of that organization in 1991. Palestinians, and many onlookers, generally believe Abu Nidal was responsible for his death. Some believe the order came from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.

==Early life and education==
Khalaf was born in northern Jaffa in 1933, close to Tel Aviv. His father, who came from Gaza, ran a grocery in Carmel Market, where half of his clients were Jewish and he spoke Hebrew, which his son also picked up from companions among Sephardic Jews. Salah had four siblings. One of his uncles was married to a Jew.

He dates his first feelings of animosity towards Jews to an incident in 1945, when he was taunted by Jewish youths for being an Arab while riding over to visit relatives. They smashed his bicycle, and, on returning home, he learnt that Jewish friends had falsely reported that he had knifed Jews in Jaffa, at a time corresponding to the bicycle incident. He was arrested, aged 11, by British police, beaten up and sentenced to a year of house arrest.

On expiry of the sentence, he joined the &#x27;lion cubs&#x27; of the Al-Najjada militia founded by his school principal Muhammad Nimr al-Hawari, which inculcated a rejection of racism, bigotry, and parochial loyalism, and taught him how to retaliate to violence with violence.

His family abandoned Jaffa by boat for Gaza on 13 May 1948, as part of a general flight inspired by news of the Deir Yassin massacre and a sense of Jewish military superiority. They fully expected to return as an expected tide in the fortunes of war changed, enabling the Arab armies to drive back to Zionists. He moved to Cairo in the early 1950s, enrolling in the Dar al-Ulum teacher&#x27;s college. There, in 1951, he became a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.

==Collaboration with Arafat, role in the PLO==
In 1951, Khalaf met Yasser Arafat at the al-Azhar University—where he studied literature—during a meeting of the General Union of Palestinian Students. He returned to Gaza in 1957 with a combined degree in philosophy and psychology, and a teacher&#x27;s certificate from Ain Shams University, where he was assigned to teach at Al Zahra, a girls&#x27; school, a position that was, in his memoirs, allocated in order to make him a pariah in the city. The posting lasted six months, after which he was transferred to teach in a makeshift school for poor refugee boys in the Gaza desert. Responding to a call from Arafat, he left for Kuwait and, together with Arafat, Farouk al-Qaddum, Khaled al-Hassan, Abd al-Muhsin al-Qatan and Khalil Ibrahim al-Wazir, founded Fatah - a name meaning &quot;Conquest&quot; composed from the reversed initials of &quot;Harakat al-Tahrir al-Watani al-Filastini&quot; (Movement for the National Liberation of Palestine).

He was accused by Israel and the United States of having founded the Black September Organization. As a result, Khalaf was arrested by the Jordanians and then released after he appealed to his comrades to stop fighting and to lay down their arms. According to Said Abu Rish&#x27;s biography of Yasser Arafat, Arafat had used the fact that Khalaf had negotiated with King Hussein of Jordan to deflect criticism from himself over the conduct of the fighting between Palestinian guerrillas and the Jordanian army in 1970–71, portraying Khalaf as weak. Some argue that the ridicule his mediation met with was a decisive factor in his turn towards tactics which were considered by his adversaries to be terroristic. Khalaf then felt the need to restore his reputation within the Palestinian community, and became one of the foremost advocates for the terror campaigns conducted by PLO fighters and others during the early 1970s. Christopher Dobson, who met Khalaf in Cairo at this time, described him as someone who would pass unnoticed in a crowd, while topping Israel&#x27;s most wanted list.
Khalaf met with the U.S. ambassador to Tunis as part of the U.S.-PLO dialogue, a contact that had been authorized by James Baker. He was a man &quot;who had been instrumental in bringing about the shift of PLO policy toward greater pragmatism.&quot; Khalaf opposed Arafat&#x27;s alliance with Saddam Hussein, in so far as, he argued, one could not side with an occupying power when one was fighting in one&#x27;s own country against an occupation. It was rumoured that he had openly expressed disagreement with the Iraqi leader in face to face meetings, and vouched to stay neutral during the Persian Gulf War in 1991.

==Assassination==
Khalaf is said to have helped the CIA in an operation to break up the Abu Nidal organization. Defectors who split off were given refuge in Tunis by the PLO. On 14 January 1991, Khalaf was assassinated in the Tunisian home of Abu Hol (Hayel Abdul Hamid, the security head of Fatah), by a Palestinian guard, Hamza Abu Zaid who was a plant from Abu Nidal&#x27;s group. Zaid shot Khalef in the head, along with Abul Hol and another PLO operative and an aide to Khalaf, Fakhri Al Omari.

Palestinians generally reacted by blaming Abu Nidal for the murder, since he was backed by Iraq, and Zaid later confessed to being in contact with Nidal. While Seale considers Abu Nidal to certainly have been behind the murder, others think the order probably came directly from Saddam Hussein.

A funeral service was held for Khalaf and the other two PLO officials in Tunis with the attendance of Yasser Arafat. Another service was held in Amman where they were buried at the martyr&#x27;s cemetery.

==Personal life==
Khalaf married his cousin on 13 July 1959. They had six children: three daughters and three sons.

==Views of Zionism==
According to Elizabeth Thompson, Khalaf regarded Zionism as an ideology exploited by a political elite which manipulated memories of Nazism in order to create a persecution complex among Jews.

==School naming==
On 24 September 2016, the Palestinian Authority named a school in Tulkarem after Khalaf. Tulkarem governor Issam Abu Bakr said that the school was named after &quot;martyr Salah Khalaf in order to commemorate the memory of this great national fighter&quot;.

==Accusations of involvement in Bologna massacre==
An Italian public attorney and retired prosecutor—and former director of investigations into the loss of Itavia Flight 870— Judge Rosario Priore argued in a book that Abu Iyad had ordered two German terrorists linked to Venezuelan Carlos the Jackal to carry out the 1980 Bologna massacre (for which three neo-fascists were convicted, including Valerio Fioravanti). The operation was ordered to avenge the break-up of the so-called &quot;lodo Moro &quot;, a secret agreement with which Aldo Moro would have guaranteed the free transit of Palestinians guerrillas and terrorists to Italy.

After the arrest of Abu Anzeh Saleh with some missiles destined to Palestinians in 1979, Abu Iyad decided to retaliate, using Czechoslovak explosive provided by Gaddafi&#x27;s Libya. The explosives were destined to the reinforced walls of Trani&#x27;s jail, in an action aimed to evade prison for Saleh. Abu Anzeh Saleh was liberated despite having taken less than two years in 1981. Former President of the Italian Republic Francesco Cossiga supported a similar thesis, but he accused George Habash instead of Abu Iyad.

<text>The House Without a Key is a 1925 novel by Earl Derr Biggers, the first of the Charlie Chan mysteries. Set in 1920s Hawaii, the novel acquaints the reader with the look and feel of the islands from the standpoint of both white and non-white inhabitants, describing social class structures and customs of the era.

==Plot summary==
The novel deals with the murder of a former member of Boston society who has lived in Hawaii for a number of years. The main character is the victim&#x27;s nephew, a straitlaced young Bostonian bond trader, who came to the islands to try to convince his aunt Minerva, whose vacation has extended many months, to return to Boston. The nephew, John Quincy Winterslip, soon falls under the spell of the islands himself, meets an attractive young woman, breaks his engagement to his straitlaced Bostonian fiancee Agatha, and decides as the murder is being solved to move to San Francisco. In the interval, he is introduced to many levels of Hawaiian society and is of some assistance to Detective Charlie Chan in solving the mystery.

The novel&#x27;s denouement is nearly identical to that in the final Perry Mason novel by Erle Stanley Gardner, &quot;The Case of the Postponed Murder&quot; (1970).

==Adaptations==
It was adapted for film twice, as &quot;The House Without a Key&quot; in 1926 and as &quot;Charlie Chan&#x27;s Greatest Case&quot; in 1933. In 1942 it was adapted for the stage by Jean Lee Latham and played in Chicago. Another dramatisation by Hal Glatzer played at the Left Coast Crime Conference in Hawai&#x27;i in 2009.

== Trivia ==
Charlie Chan does not speak his first word until page 82 (first paperback edition).

The novel was written by Biggers at the Halekulani hotel on Waikīkī Beach which features a restaurant named &quot;House Without a Key&quot;.

<doc id="751245" wikidata="Q7157849" url="?curid=751245" title="Peak bagging">
<text>Peak bagging or hill bagging is an activity in which hikers, climbers, and mountaineers attempt to reach a collection of summits, published in the form of a list. This activity has been popularized around the world, with lists such as 100 Peaks of Taiwan, four-thousand footers, &quot;100 Famous Japanese Mountains&quot;, the Sacred Mountains of China, the Seven Summits, the Fourteeners of Colorado, and the eight-thousanders becoming the subject of mass public interest.

There are numerous lists that a peakbagger may choose to follow. A list usually contains a set of peaks confined to a geographical area, with the peaks having some sort of subjective popularity or objective significance, such as being among the highest or most prominent of the area. Some maps and lists may be inaccurate, however, which has implications for climbers and peak-baggers who rely on publicly reported data.

Although peak bagging is a fundamental part of the sport of mountaineering, the term is strongly associated with hiking and other non-technical activities like snowshoeing. A handful of lists, such as the eight-thousanders and the Alpine four-thousanders, have an extremely high reputation among mountaineers, but in general the term &quot;peak bagging&quot; is a pejorative to many climbers.

Peak bagging is distinguished from highpointing, where the goal is to reach the highest point in some geographic area (e.g. county, state, or country), whether or not it is a peak.

==History==

During the Silver Age of Alpinism in the late 19th century, most of the unclimbed major mountaineering objectives were reached. With the &quot;closing&quot; of the age of discovery of mountain peaks, interest shifted towards finding enjoyable ways to climb already-ascended mountains. In the 1890s, Sir Hugh Munro created the Munro list, containing the highest peaks of Scotland; summiting the peaks on such lists soon became known as &quot;peak bagging&quot;. 

The list of the Adirondack High Peaks, compiled by Robert and George Marshall, was first published in 1922. Almost at the same time, the list of Colorado fourteeners became a peak bagging challenge. Backpacking increased in popularity in the United States between the 1950s and 1980s, causing additional clubs to organize peak-bagging lists, including the New Hampshire and New England Four-thousand footers, the Northeast 111, and the Catskill Mountain 3500 Club.

== Aspects ==
A central part of peak bagging is the &quot;list&quot;, which details all the summits one must obtain to &quot;complete&quot; or &quot;finish&quot; the list. In some cases, a climber who finishes a list may receive some form of award, such as an emblem or badge. In the case of the eight-thousanders list, some mountaineers may become famous within the mountaineering community.

=== Clubs ===
Clubs are often formed to gather people who share an interest in bagging peaks on a list. Some clubs are specialized, such as the Sierra Peaks Section or the Adirondack Forty-Sixers. Alpine clubs may include peak bagging as one of the activities for members; notable alpine clubs that maintain peak bagging lists include the Scottish Mountaineering Club, the Mazamas of Oregon and the Mountaineers of Washington. Other clubs may promote the climbing of peaks on a list they do not maintain or may create an authoritative version of a list that is already popular; a reflection of this is the relationship between the 4000m peaks of Alps and the UIAA.

=== Books ===
Another source of lists are mountaineering guidebooks that detail information about how to climb peaks in a certain region. &quot;100 Famous Japanese Mountains&quot;, &quot;Fifty Classic Climbs of North America&quot;, and the &quot;Alpine Club Guides&quot; are notable examples of such books.

=== Reaching a summit ===

Generally, the summit block has to be reached and the climber must touch or be within a few horizontal meters of the highest point. However this convention is not universal, due to the varying objectives of individual peak baggers. Many clubs have special rules that attempt to address various considerations.

Some peak baggers increase the challenge of summiting a list of peaks in various ways, such as by requiring a minimum vertical climb per peak, climbing within a time limit, climbing in different seasons (such as winter), or climbing the same peak multiple times by different routes. Traditional mountaineers and climbers may elect to only go up routes with certain climbing grades

Various organizations have adopted rules for what to do when a peak is on private land or otherwise inaccessible, whether off-road vehicles may be used, etc.

== Summit logs ==
In some parts of the world, a summit register or summit log may be located in a watertight container such as a jar or can, stashed in a protected spot. Peak baggers often will write a note or log entry and leave it in the &quot;summit log&quot; as a record of their accomplishment. Increasingly, peak baggers are also logging their summits online by signing virtual summit logs. One popular website is peakbagger.com, founded by Greg Slayden, which lists mountains and regional highpoints. It allows peak baggers to record their summits.

== Arguments for and against ==
The term &quot;peak bagging&quot; can have a negative connotation among traditional mountaineers. Traditional climbers or adventurers may argue that peak bagging devalues the experience of climbing in favour of the achievement of reaching an arbitrary point on a map; that bagging reduces climbing to the status of stamp collecting or train spotting; or that is seen as obsessive and beside the point. For example, in explaining why he chose to remove some minor peaks from his guidebook, climber Steve Roper wrote:
Most of the peaks had as their first ascenders those who in a former day would have been called explorers but now could only be thought of as peakbaggers, interested primarily in trudging endlessly over heaps of stones, building cairns, and inserting their business cards into specifically designed canisters especially carried for this purpose. But perhaps I am being too harsh. They&#x27;re having their fun.
Some peak baggers say peak bagging is a motivation to keep reaching new summits. For mountain range peak lists, attaining the goal provides the peak bagger with a deeper appreciation for the topography of the range. For example, each peak is typically enjoyed from multiple aspects as the peak bagger also climbs the major neighboring summits.

There is also concern that encouraging the climbing of certain mountains has caused trail damage from erosion through heavy use and, where mountains have no trails, created trails. Proponents note that many peak baggers become active in maintaining trails and more aware about mitigating damage than casual hikers.

<doc id="751252" wikidata="Q702016" url="?curid=751252" title="Lajos Batthyány">
<text>Count Lajos Batthyány de Németújvár (; ; 10 February 1807 – 6 October 1849) was the first Prime Minister of Hungary. He was born in Pozsony (modern-day Bratislava) on 10 February 1807, and was executed by firing squad in Pest on 6 October 1849, the same day as the 13 Martyrs of Arad.

==Career==
His father was Count József Sándor Batthyány von Német-Újvár (1777–1812), his mother Borbála Skerlecz de Lomnicza (1779–1834). He had an elder sister, Countess Amalia (who married, and divorced, Count Franz Oliver von Jenison-Walworth, and later then Count von Westerholt-Gysenberg. At an early age, he moved to Vienna with his mother and his brother after his parents&#x27; divorce. Batthyány had a private tutor, but his mother sent him to a boarding school and Batthyány rarely saw his mother again.

===Early years===
At the age of 16 Batthyány finished his studies at boarding school and attended the academy in Zagreb (now University of Zagreb, Croatia). In 1826 he took a tour of duty in Italy for four years, where he was promoted to lieutenant and got his law degree.

In 1830 he became a hereditary peer in the Upper House in Hungary and took his seat in the Parliament, but at this time Battyhány was not a politician by nature.

In December 1834 he married Countess Antónia Zichy de Zich et Vásonkeő (daughter of Count Károly Zichy de Zich et Vásonkeő and Countess Antónia Batthyány von Német-Újvár). Their children were: Countess Amália Batthyány von Német-Újvár (1837–1922), Ilona Keglevich von Buzin (1842–1929) and Count Elemér Batthyány (1847–1932). Batthyány&#x27;s friend said that Antónia (his wife) encouraged him to take on larger responsibilities in politics.

=== Batthyány, the Reform politician ===
Batthyány became more involved after the 1839–1840 diet in Pozsony and was the Leader of the Opposition. He drew up a reform plan for them. Batthyány advised employing stenographers to record verbatim the proceedings of the Upper House starting in 1840.

Batthyány agreed with István Széchenyi&#x27;s views on economics and politics. At the beginning of the 1830s Batthyány was one of the people who promoted horse breeding in Hungary. Later they expanded into other animal breeding and established the Association of Hungarian Economy. Batthyány, following Széchenyi, supported breeding silkworms: he planted more than 50,000 mulberry trees on his farm to cultivate them. The Vas shire county and the Economics Association of Szombathely were founded with Batthyány&#x27;s help.

At the start he agreed with Széchenyi that the new noblemen and aristocrats had to lead the new reform movement, but Batthyány&#x27;s views were much closer to that of the nobility. Because of this Batthyány tried to bite his tongue when dealing with Széchenyi and Lajos Kossuth. From 1843 onward he started to work with Kossuth.

In the 1843–1844 parliament Batthyány was the Leader of the Opposition for the entire parliament, and criticised the Habsburg monarchy&#x27;s internal affairs and foreign policy.

After the dissolution of parliament Batthyány moved to Pest and in 1845 he was elected as the chairman of the Central Election Office. He had an important role in the other economic associations and set up the (roughly: &quot;Defence society&quot; ). On 15 March 1847 an amalgamation of the Hungarian Leftist movements (the Maverick Party) was founded and Batthyány became its first President.

Batthyány supported Kossuth both morally and financially. Kossuth became the representative for  in the 1847 diet. After this Batthyány was the Leader of the Opposition in the Upper House while Kossuth had the same role in the Lower House.

=== The Batthyány Government === 

Batthyány was part of the delegation to the Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria. They insisted Hungary&#x27;s government be supreme in its territory. On 17 March 1848 the Emperor assented and Batthyány created the first Hungarian Diet. On 23 March 1848, as head of government, Batthyány commended his administration to the Diet.

The first task of the new government was to work out the revolution&#x27;s policies. After these were agreed, the government began to take action on 11 April 1848. At that time the internal affairs and foreign policy of Hungary were unstable, and Batthyány faced many problems. His first and most important act was to organise the armed forces and the local government. He insisted that the Austrian army, when in Hungary, would come under Hungarian law, and this was conceded by the Austrian Empire. He tried to repatriate conscripted soldiers to Hungary. He established the Organisation of Militiamen, whose job was to ensure internal security. In May 1848 he started to organise the independent Hungarian Revolutionary Army and recruited men into it. Batthyány took control of the Organisation of Militiamen until Lázár Mészáros returned. At the same time, he was Minister of War.

Batthyány was a very capable leader, but he was in the middle of a clash between the Austrian monarchy and the Hungarian separatists. He was devoted to the constitutional monarchy and aimed to uphold the constitution, but the Emperor was dissatisfied with his work. On 29 August, with the assent of parliament, Batthyány and Ferenc Deák went to the Emperor to ask him to order the Serbs to capitulate and to stop Jelačić, who was planning to attack Hungary. At the same time, Batthyány made Jelačić the offer that Croatia – as part of the lands of the Hungarian Crown -, could separate from it peacefully. Batthyány&#x27;s efforts were unsuccessful: even though the Emperor formally relieved Jelačić of his duties, in practice Jelačić and his army invaded Hungary on 11 September 1848.

So Batthyány and his government resigned, except for Kossuth, Szemere, and Mészáros. Later, at the request of Archduke Stephen, Palatine of Hungary, Batthyány became Prime Minister again. On 13 September Batthyány announced a rebellion and requested that the Palatine lead it. However the Palatine, under orders from the Emperor, resigned his position and left Hungary.

The Emperor did not recognise the new government on 25 September. He also invalidated Batthyány&#x27;s leadership and nominated Count Franz Philipp von Lamberg as the leader of the Hungarian army. But Lamberg was assassinated by the rebels in Pest on 28 September. Meanwhile, Batthyány travelled to Vienna again to seek a compromise with the Emperor.

Batthyány was successful in his hurried efforts to organize the Hungarian Revolutionary Army: the new army defeated the Croatians on 29 September at the Battle of Pákozd.

Batthyány realised that he could not compromise with the Emperor, so on 2 October he resigned again and nominated Miklós Vay as his successor. At the same time, Batthyány resigned his seat in parliament.

=== Resignation ===
As an ordinary soldier, Batthyány joined József Vidos&#x27; army, and fought against general Kuzman Todorović, but on 11 October 1848 he fell off his horse and broke his arm.

After Batthyány recovered he was again elected as a politician. Batthyány didn&#x27;t want the Parliament to move to Debrecen. Because of his proposal the Parliament sent a delegation (including Batthyány himself) to General Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz to meet with him as the Parliament wanted to know Windisch-Grätz&#x27;s purpose. But the general didn&#x27;t want to meet with Batthyány, only with the other members of the delegation.

On 8 January 1849 Batthyány went back to Pest, where he was captured at the Károly Palace and imprisoned in the Budai barracks. When the Hungarian army was nearer Pest, Batthyány was taken away to Pozsony, Ljubljana and Olmütz (now Olomouc, Czech Republic). The Hungarians tried to rescue him many times, but Batthyány asked them not to. Batthyány insisted that his actions were legitimate and that the court had no jurisdiction.

==Execution==

On 16 August 1849 in Olmütz the Military Court sent Batthyány to his fate. At first they wanted to confiscate his possessions and give him a prison sentence, but under pressure from Prince Felix von Schwarzenberg and the Austrian Empire they instead sentenced Batthyány to death.

The Hungarians carried Batthyány to Pest, because they hoped that general Julius Jacob von Haynau (in the name of the Emperor) would give him mercy, but Haynau sentenced him to hang. In her last visit, Batthyány&#x27;s wife smuggled a small sword into the prison. Batthyány tried to commit suicide by cutting his jugular veins, but he failed in the attempt. Because of the scars on his neck, the court changed the sentence to execution by firing squad.

On the evening of 6 October Batthyány was drugged and because of this he walked to the New Building. He had lost much blood because of his suicide attempt so that two people had to escort him. He was relieved to see that there were no gallows. Baron Johann Franz Kempen von Fichtenstamm, the commander of the military district in Pest and Buda knew that it was impossible to execute Batthyány by firing squad in his drugged state, but he sought no delay, so decided to shoot him in the head. Batthyány knelt in front of the firing squad and shouted: (&quot;Long live my country! Come on, huntsmen!&quot;).

Batthyány&#x27;s funeral was in the city centre, in the vault of the Greyfriars Church. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, in 1870 his remains were moved to the newly built mausoleum in the Kerepesi Cemetery.

== Works ==
Batthyány&#x27;s parliamentary speeches are preserved in contemporary diaries and political newspapers. His essay on cultivating sugar beet was printed in the periodical in 1842.

<text>The Birmingham Sunlights is an American a cappella gospel singing group from the Birmingham, Alabama area.

This group developed their style within the Church of Christ, a Christian denominational group in which no instruments are used for performing church music. Brothers James, Barry, and Steve Taylor founded the group in 1978, originally consisting of them and Reginald Speights and Wayne Williams. The group has appeared at numerous music festivals in the United States, including the National Folk Festival. They were designated as Cultural Ambassadors by the United States Department of State and in that role performed in Canada, Italy, France, five African countries, the Caribbean, and Australia.

Their song &quot;All Night&quot; appears on the 2008 album &quot;Carry On: Celebrating Twenty Years of the Alabama Folk Arts Apprenticeship Program&quot;.

The group was named as a recipient of a 2009 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government&#x27;s highest honor in the folk and traditional arts.

<doc id="751265" wikidata="Q465995" url="?curid=751265" title="Peugeot 407">
<text>The Peugeot 407 is a large family car (D-segment) produced by the French automaker Peugeot from 2004 to 2011. It was available in saloon, coupé and estate variants, with both diesel and petrol engines. The petrol engines range from 1.8 to 3.0 liters displacement, whereas the diesel engines range from 1.6 to 3.0-liter engines.

Sales commenced in June 2004, in France, with the rest of Europe sales commencing the following month. According to the website of the European Car of the Year, the 407 was one of the nominees for the award, in 2005.

The 407 was introduced in June 2004 as a replacement to the Peugeot 406 and was replaced in April 2011 by the Peugeot 508. The last Peugeot 407 was produced on 5 July 2011, with the coupé model remained in production until December 2011.

==Overview==
The 407 was the successor to the hugely successful Peugeot 406, and was launched in &quot;The Sunday Times Motorshow Live&quot;, on May 27, 2004. The streamlined design of the car was seen as quite radical by magazines, such as &quot;Autocar&quot;, its most distinctive features being its large front grille, and the steeply raked screen pillars.

&quot;Autocar&quot; also published undisguised spy photos, on three occasions throughout 2003, and commented the rear window line of the saloon had &quot;the similar feel to the short wheelbase of the Ferrari 250.&quot; The car was first announced, and presented to the press in Paris, in February 2004, and Groupe PSA (then known as PSA Peugeot Citroën) invested in €1.12 billion, in launching the car.

The estate, known as the Peugeot 407 &quot;SW&quot;, was launched four months after the saloon event, in September 2004. The coupé was launched in July 2005, having been presented at the Frankfurt Motor Show of September 2005, and going on sale in January 2006. The annual sales of the Peugeot 407 peaked at units in 2005, with sales outside Europe. The coupé production ended in March 2012.

The models were given a minor facelift in August 2008, resulting in most petrol engine models being withdrawn from sale in the United Kingdom, and other European countries. One model was available with &quot;AMVAR&quot; electronic suspension that controls each wheel&#x27;s damping independently, adapting the hardness of the ride every 2.5 milliseconds, to suit the driving style.

The 407, both in sedan and coupe versions, received 5 out of 5 stars in EuroNCAP tests.

== Design ==
The design of the car is very curved, which brings the design of the 407 more in line with the smaller Peugeot 307&#x27;s looks. Its &quot;face&quot; features have angry-looking eyes and a big mouth. These changes from the more conservative looks of previous models have both its fans and critics.

The pre-facelift saloon model has a 0.29 drag coefficient.

==Safety==

==Engines==
All engines have DOHC and four valves per cylinder. All petrol engines have multi-point fuel injection. All diesels have common rail direct injection


==Television commercials==
The first advertisement, known as &quot;The Toys&quot; or &quot;Les Jouets&quot;, featured life-size toy cars shown up, by the sleek newly released Peugeot 407. Directed by Philippe André, for agency BETC Euro RSCG, the advert was filmed in Sydney, Australia (we see cars crossing the Sydney Harbour Bridge). André developed twenty model cars, especially for the shoot. This campaign was launched in June 2004.

The soundtrack was provided by French duo, &quot;The Film&quot;, (Guillaume Brière &amp; Benjamin Lebeau) with their song &quot;Can You Touch Me&quot;, an adaptation of their earlier song, &quot;Can You Trust Me&quot;.

The next advertisement featured the same scenario of life-size toy cars in Sydney, this time taking a new Peugeot 407 SW out of the city, to the beachside home. Along the way, we see old and decrepit station wagons breaking down, or suffering from image problems. The soundtrack features &quot;(Lady) Hear Me Tonight&quot; by the Modjo. The commercials used the slogan &quot;Playtime is Over&quot;, which some perceived to be the retort, to the then slogan of Renault&#x27;s Laguna, &quot;Serious Playtime&quot;, which was launched in August 2002.

The slogan given at the end in Spanish was &quot;Volvamos a hablar de automóviles&quot;, i.e. &quot;Let&#x27;s talk about cars again&quot;.

==407 concept cars==
The saloon version of the 407 was first previewed, with the name &quot;407 Elixir&quot;, at the 2003 Frankfurt Motor Show. The &quot;407 Silhouette&quot; is a race car, with most design features of the current coupé. A version, almost identical, to the released coupé, was presented at the 2005 Geneva Motor Show, under the name &quot;407 Prologue&quot;. The &quot;407 Macarena&quot; is the four-door coupé convertible, produced by Heuliez, and was presented at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show.

===Notable film appearances===
The 407 sedan appeared in the comedy film &quot;Taxi 4&quot; of 2007, and the film &quot;Taxi 5&quot;, of 2018, unlike the previous films (&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot;) which had its predecessor (the 406).

===Successor===
Philippe Varin, from PSA, announced in November 2010 that the successor of the Peugeot 407 would not be called the Peugeot 408, but instead the Peugeot 508, which was officially launched at the Paris Motor Show, in October 2010.

The saloon of the 508 was approximately 12 cm (5 inches) longer than the 407, and also replaced the larger Peugeot 607. The name Peugeot 408 was used for the Chinese built notchback version of the Peugeot 308, that replaced the 407 in South America.

==Model car releases==
The saloon of the Peugeot 407 has been produced by Majorette and Norev, while the &quot;SW&quot; was only produced by Norev.

The coupé has been produced by Norev and Welly, and the concept &quot;407 Elixr&quot;, which was presented in the 2003 Frankfurt Motor Show, has been produced only by Norev.

<text>Hélder Manuel Marques Postiga (; born 2 August 1982) is a Portuguese retired professional footballer who played as a striker.

After beginning at Porto, where he won eight items of silverware along the way, he amassed Primeira Liga totals of 195 games and 54 goals over 11 seasons, with that club, Sporting CP and Rio Ave. He also played in six foreign countries, most notably in Spain where he totalled 27 goals in 99 La Liga matches for three teams.

A Portugal international since 2003, Postiga represented the country in two World Cups and three European Championships, helping the nation to reach the final at Euro 2004.

==Club career==
===Porto===
Born in Vila do Conde, Postiga began his career at nearby Varzim. In 1995, he joined Porto&#x27;s youth system and continued to progress until he reached the reserve squad. At the time, coach Octávio Machado picked him for the first team on some occasions and the player performed well.

After José Mourinho was hired as manager, Postiga became a first-team regular. The 20-year-old scored 19 times in 2002–03, playing alongside Derlei as Porto won the treble. This included 13 in a victorious league run as well as five in an eventual conquest of the UEFA Cup, although he missed the final due to suspension. Following his successful season, he made his senior international debut for Portugal.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
On 25 June 2003, Postiga moved to Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur for £6.25 million (€9 million), a fee that could have risen to £8.36 million (€12 million). He signed a five-year contract, with manager Glenn Hoddle remarking: &quot;He is a player who will add definite striking quality to our squad and is a young player of proven ability. I&#x27;m sure our supporters will enjoy watching him over the coming seasons.&quot;

Postiga made his debut on 16 August 2003 in a 1–0 away defeat to Birmingham City, starting but being replaced by fellow new signing Bobby Zamora after 57 minutes. His first goal came on 3 December, the second of a 3–1 home win against Manchester City in the round of 16 of the League Cup, while his only in the league contributed to a 2–1 victory over Liverpool on 17 January 2004, also at White Hart Lane.

===Porto return===

In summer 2004, Postiga returned to Porto in a deal that sent Pedro Mendes in the other direction, with the striker being valued at €7.5 million. New coach Víctor Fernández included him in the team for the upcoming campaign, but he had another disappointing year; however, following José Couceiro&#x27;s appointment as manager, he managed to score three goals.

In 2005, after a promising preseason, Postiga was demoted to the B team as Co Adriaanse was not happy with his performances. In January of the following year, trying to earn a place in the 2006 World Cup, he moved on loan to Saint-Étienne, where he netted twice in Ligue 1, against Metz and Le Mans, both resulting in 1–0 away wins.

Back at Porto for 2006–07, Postiga found himself back in the main squad due to a managerial change. A regular starter in the beginning, he nonetheless fell out of favour towards the end of the season, losing his place to Brazilian Adriano though he still managed to score 11 league goals; in his two spells, he appeared in 165 games in all competitions and netted 48 times.

In mid-January 2008, after having again fallen out of favour, Postiga moved to Panathinaikos on a six-month loan. His first goal for the club came in the Athens derby against AEK Athens, in which he equalised (1–1).

===Sporting CP===
On 1 June 2008, Postiga moved to Portuguese rivals Sporting CP, signing a three-year contract for a reported transfer fee of €2.5 million, with the Lisbon side acquiring 50% of the player&#x27;s rights. He scored his first official goal for his new club on 1 September, the only in a victory at Braga.

Postiga&#x27;s second season as a &quot;Lion&quot; was disastrous, both collectively – Sporting finished fourth – and individually (he only found the net on 19 April 2010, closing the 2–1 home win over Vitória de Setúbal after just one minute on the pitch); although he began as a starter, he soon lost his job to youth graduate Carlos Saleiro.

===Zaragoza===

On 31 August 2011, the last day of the summer transfer window, Postiga joined Real Zaragoza of La Liga for €1 million. At the Spanish side, he reunited with his compatriots Fernando Meira and Rúben Micael.

After three disallowed goals in as many matches, Postiga opened his scoring account on 16 October 2011, netting twice in a 2–0 home defeat of Real Sociedad; this included a bicycle kick in the 11th minute of the game. He finished the season as club top scorer, in an eventual narrow escape from relegation.

On 10 November 2012, Postiga scored a brace to help the Aragonese to a 5–3 defeat of ten-men Deportivo de La Coruña. He scored a career-best 14 goals during the campaign, but his team was relegated.

===Valencia===
On 8 August 2013, Postiga joined Valencia for a fee of £2.6 million, replacing Tottenham-bound Roberto Soldado. On 1 September, in only the third match of the season, he netted twice late into the first half of the game against Barcelona at the Mestalla Stadium, but in an eventual 2–3 home loss.

Postiga was loaned to Lazio for the remainder of the campaign on 30 January 2014, with the option of a permanent move afterwards. He made his debut in Serie A on 26 March, playing 20 minutes in a 2–0 away defeat to Genoa.

===Deportivo===
On 1 September 2014, Postiga terminated his link with Valencia, and subsequently signed a one-year deal with fellow top-division team Deportivo. He made his competitive debut two weeks later, featuring the full 90 minutes of a 1–0 win at Eibar. His first goal for the Galicians came in his fifth match on 31 October: coming on at half-time for Luis Fariña, he scored a consolation in a 1–2 home loss to Getafe. A week later, he was sent off in the 29th minute of a goalless draw at Córdoba, earning a second yellow card for a reaction when fouled by Íñigo López.

Postiga spent the better part of the season injured, as &quot;Depor&quot; went on to narrowly avoid relegation.

===Atlético Kolkata===
On 29 July 2015, Postiga signed as the marquee player of Indian Super League franchise Atlético de Kolkata; at 32, he was the youngest such player in the competition, and was deemed by the management to be less injury-prone than his predecessor Luis García. He made his debut on 3 October in the opening game of the season, scoring twice in a 3–2 win at Chennaiyin but leaving with an injury. He made no further appearances, as they went on to be eliminated by precisely that opponent in the play-off semi-finals.

===Rio Ave===
On 1 February 2016, Postiga returned to his homeland, signing for top-flight Rio Ave until the end of the season. In his second match, 26 days later, he opened a 2–1 away victory over Boavista which was his 50th goal in the division.

On 14 May 2016, in the last fixture, Postiga scored the winning goal as his team won 2–1 at União da Madeira, qualifying for the Europa League and relegating their opponents.

===Return to Kolkata===
On 12 August 2016, Postiga returned to Atlético Kolkata as their marquee player. Early in his second match of the season, away to Kerala Blasters on 5 October, he suffered another long-term injury; the club&#x27;s ownership admitted that due to such concerns they had wanted a different figurehead.

Postiga returned to the lineups and the side eventually won the championship, although he was substituted in the final.

==International career==

Postiga earned the first of his 71 caps for the Portugal national team (27 goals) on 12 February 2003 in a friendly with Italy, where he came on as a substitute for Tiago Mendes in the 70th minute – this game was also Luiz Felipe Scolari&#x27;s first as manager. He was handed his first start on 10 June in the 4–0 win over Bolivia, where he scored his first two international goals.
Even though he had arguably a poor year with Tottenham, Postiga was selected for UEFA Euro 2004. In the tournament, he managed to save his team from defeat against England during the quarter-finals, netting an 83rd-minute equaliser to level the score at 1–1 as Portugal would prevail in the penalty shootout 6–5 after a 2–2 draw. He converted his attempt with a &quot;Panenka-style&quot; shot, but did not feature in the final, lost 1–0 to outsiders Greece.

Postiga was included in the 2006 FIFA World Cup squad, starting against Mexico in a 2–1 win at the end of the group phase. In the quarter-finals, after replacing captain Luís Figo, he again scored to eliminate England on penalties, as the nation eventually finished fourth.

In Euro 2008, Postiga was also mainly used from the bench. In the quarter-finals against Germany, he scored a late goal by heading in a cross from fellow replacement Nani, although Portugal lost 3–2.

After more than two years of absence from the national team setup, Postiga was called up for two Euro 2012 qualifiers with Denmark and Iceland, in October 2010. On 12 October, against the latter, he netted in a 3–1 away victory. On 17 November, he put two past world champions Spain in a 4–0 friendly win in Lisbon.

On 4 June 2011, Postiga scored the only goal in a Euro 2012 qualifier against Norway played at Estádio da Luz, which made him the tenth highest scorer in Portugal&#x27;s history. He added a brace on 15 November that year, in a 6–2 play-off second leg defeat of Bosnia and Herzegovina which secured a place in the competition.

Picked by Paulo Bento for the finals in Poland and Ukraine as first-choice striker, Postiga scored in the group-stage fixture against Denmark, the second in an eventual 3–2 win. He injured his right thigh in the first half of the national side&#x27;s 1–0 quarter-final victory over the Czech Republic, being sidelined for the rest of the tournament.

Postiga scored six goals in the qualification campaign for the 2014 World Cup. On 6 September 2013, he was sent off in the first half of a 3–2 win in Northern Ireland for headbutting Gareth McAuley; at the finals, he started the second game against the United States after an injury to Hugo Almeida in the opener, but was himself substituted 16 minutes later due to physical problems as Portugal were eliminated in the group stage.

==Personal life==
A childhood fan of Benfica who went on to play for their two main rivals, Postiga grew up in the Caxinas fishing neighbourhood of Vila do Conde, as did his long-time international teammates Bruno Alves and Fábio Coentrão.

Postiga&#x27;s younger brother, José, was also a footballer and a forward. He played youth football at Sporting.
