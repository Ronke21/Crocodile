<text>In cryptography, the M-209, designated CSP-1500 by the United States Navy (C-38 by the manufacturer) is a portable, mechanical cipher machine used by the US military primarily in World War II, though it remained in active use through the Korean War. The M-209 was designed by Swedish cryptographer Boris Hagelin in response to a request for such a portable cipher machine, and was an improvement of an earlier machine, the C-36.

The M-209 is about the size of a lunchbox, in its final form measuring and weighing (plus for the case). It represented a brilliant achievement for pre-electronic technology. It was a rotor machine similar to a telecipher machine, such as the Lorenz cipher and the Geheimfernschreiber.

==Basic operation==

Basic operation of the M-209 is relatively straightforward. Six adjustable &quot;key wheels&quot; on top of the box each display a letter of the alphabet. These six wheels comprise the external key for the machine, providing an initial state, similar to an initialization vector, for the enciphering process.

To encipher a message, the operator sets the key wheels to a random sequence of letters. An &quot;enciphering-deciphering knob&quot; on the left side of the machine is set to &quot;encipher&quot;. A dial known as the &quot;indicator disk&quot;, also on the left side, is turned to the first letter in the message. This letter is encoded by turning a hand crank or &quot;power handle&quot; on the right side of the machine; at the end of the cycle, the ciphertext letter is printed onto a paper tape, the key wheels each advance one letter, and the machine is ready for entry of the next character in the message. To indicate spaces between words in the message, the letter &quot;Z&quot; is enciphered. Repeating the process for the remainder of the message gives a complete ciphertext, which can then be transmitted using Morse code or another method. Since the initial key wheel setting is random, it is also necessary to send those settings to the receiving party; these may also be encrypted using a daily key or transmitted in the clear.

Printed ciphertext is automatically spaced into groups of five by the M-209 for ease of readability. A &quot;letter counter&quot; on top of the machine indicated the total number of encoded letters, and could be used as a point of reference if a mistake was made in enciphering or deciphering.

The deciphering procedure is nearly the same as for enciphering; the operator sets the enciphering-deciphering knob to &quot;decipher&quot;, and aligns the key wheels to the same sequence as was used in enciphering. The first letter of the ciphertext is entered via the indicator disk, and the power handle is operated, advancing the key wheels and printing the decoded letter on the paper tape. When the letter &quot;Z&quot; is encountered, a cam causes a blank space to appear in the message, thus reconstituting the original message with spaces. Absent &quot;Z&quot;s can typically be interpreted by the operator, based on context.

An experienced M-209 operator might spend two to four seconds enciphering or deciphering each letter.

==Internal elements==

===Overview===
Inside the casing of the M-209, a much more complicated picture emerges. The six key wheels each have a small movable pin aligned with each letter on the wheel. These pins may each be positioned to the left or right; the positioning of these pins affects the operation of the machine. The left position is &quot;ineffective&quot;, while the right position is &quot;effective&quot;.

Each key wheel contains a different number of letters, and a correspondingly different number of pins. From left to right, the wheels have:
* 26 letters, from A to Z
* 25 letters, from A to Z, excepting W
* 23 letters, from A to X, excepting W
* 21 letters, from A to U
* 19 letters, from A to S
* 17 letters, from A to Q

This discrepancy is chosen to give the wheel sizes a coprime nature; the end result is that the wheels only align the same way once every 26×25×23×21×19×17 = 101,405,850 enciphered letters (also known as the &quot;period&quot;). Each key wheel is associated with a slanted metal &quot;guide arm&quot; that is activated by any pins in the &quot;effective&quot; position. The positions of the pins on each key wheel comprise the first part of the internal keying mechanism of the M-209.

Behind the row of six key wheels is a cylindrical drum consisting of 27 horizontal bars. Each drum bar is affixed with two movable &quot;lugs&quot;; the lugs can be aligned with any of the six key wheels, or may be placed in one of two &quot;neutral&quot; positions. An effective pin causes its guide arm to tilt forward, contacting the drum. The positioning of the lugs comprises the second part of the internal keying mechanism. Owing to the complexity of setting the internal keying mechanism, it was altered relatively infrequently; changing internal keys once a day was common in practice.

When the operator turns the power handle, the cylindrical drum makes a complete revolution through all 27 bars. If a lug on one of the bars contacts the guide arm of an active key wheel, that bar is slid to the left; lugs in neutral positions, or which do not contact a guide arm, do not affect the position of the bar. All bars that are slid to the left comprise a variable-toothed gear, which in turn shifts the letter to be encoded; the shift is equal to the number of bars protruding to the left. The resulting ciphertext letter is printed onto the paper tape.

After the rotation is complete, a &quot;retractor&quot; pushes the protruding bars back into place. A set of &quot;intermediate gears&quot; advances the key wheels by one position, and a locking arm latches into the drum to prevent a second encoding until the indicator disk is adjusted for the next letter.

This system allowed the offset to change for each enciphered letter; without this facility, the enciphering scheme would resemble a very insecure Caesar shift cipher.

===Example configuration===
Prior to encoding anything using the M-209, the operator must set the machine according to a preset configuration. This configuration includes the settings for each pin on all six of the key wheels, and the position of each lug on the rotating drum; these were typically specified by tables in a secret system publication given to both sender and receiver. The rotational alignment of the key wheels could be chosen by the sender at random, and provided to the receiver via a secure channel of communication.

Each letter on each key wheel is associated with a pin that can be set either to the left or right. A table specifying the setting of these pins might resemble the following:

Letters that are present in the table for a given key wheel should have their corresponding pin set to the right, or &quot;effective&quot;, position. Absent letters, represented by a dash, are set to the left, or &quot;ineffective&quot;, position.

The rotating drum has 27 bars, each with two &quot;lugs&quot;. These lugs can be set to any position 1 through 6, in which case they are aligned with the corresponding key wheel, or they may be set to one of two &quot;0&quot; positions, in which case they are ineffective. A table indicating the lug settings for the drum might look like this:

Bar 1 would have its lugs set in the &quot;3&quot; and &quot;6&quot; positions, bar 2&#x27;s lugs in the &quot;0&quot; and &quot;6&quot; positions, and so on. Any lug in the &quot;3&quot; position, for example, will be pushed to the side by a guide arm when the currently active pin on key wheel 3 is in an &quot;effective&quot; position.

Finally, the external key is set by rotating the key wheels to either a specific or random sequence of letters. In testing the internal key settings of the M-209, it is customary for the operator to set the key wheels to &quot;AAAAAA&quot;, and proceed with encoding a message consisting of nothing but the letter &quot;A.&quot; The resulting ciphertext is then compared with a long &quot;check string&quot; to verify that all of the internal settings have been performed properly. The check string for this particular configuration is:

 T N J U W A U Q T K C Z K N U T O T B C W A R W I O

Key wheel pins come into play when they reach the lower part of the key wheel during rotation; it is here that they may contact or release the guide arm that deflects the lugs to the left. The active pin is offset by a particular amount from the letter currently being displayed on the front of the key wheel; when &quot;AAAAAA&quot; is showing on the key wheels, the pins that are in play are those associated with the letters &quot;PONMLK&quot;, from left to right.

===Example encoding===
After the M-209 is configured according to the settings above, the machine is ready to encode. Continuing with the example of a known &quot;check string&quot;, the first letter to be encoded is &quot;A&quot;. The operator sets the indicating disk to the letter &quot;A&quot;, and turns the power handle.

Since the key wheels are set to the string &quot;AAAAAA&quot;, the active pins are &quot;PONMLK&quot;; according to the settings above, pin &quot;P&quot; is ineffective on the first key wheel, pin &quot;O&quot; is effective on the second key wheel, &quot;N&quot; is effective on the third, &quot;M&quot; is effective on the fourth, &quot;L&quot; is ineffective on the fifth, and &quot;K&quot; is effective on the sixth. The guide arms associated with effective pins will tilt forward and contact the rotating drum; in this case, guide arms 2, 3, 4, and 6 will be effective.

Any bar on the drum with a lug in any of those positions will be slid to the left, and that bar will participate in the variable-toothed gear driving the output of the machine. According to the given settings, bars 1, 2, 3, and 5 through 21 will be slid to the left, for a total of 20 bars, or 20 &quot;teeth&quot; on the variable-toothed gear. The encoding for this letter will use a shift of 20.

The M-209 uses a reciprocal substitution cipher or &quot;Beaufort&quot; scheme; the alphabet used in the plaintext message is mapped to the same alphabet in reverse (&quot;atbash&quot;):

If shifting is not considered, &quot;A&quot; becomes &quot;Z&quot;, &quot;B&quot; becomes &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;C&quot; becomes &quot;X&quot; and so on. Shifting proceeds in a reverse direction; for instance, a plaintext &quot;P&quot; maps to ciphertext &quot;K&quot;; shifting by three positions, to the left, gives ciphertext &quot;N&quot;. The shift is circular, so when a shift steps off the left side, it continues again on the right. This approach is self-inversing, meaning that deciphering uses the same table in the same way: a ciphertext &quot;N&quot; is entered as if it were plaintext; this maps to &quot;M&quot; in the ciphertext alphabet, or &quot;P&quot; after shifting three positions, thus giving the original plaintext back.

Continuing the example above, the initial letter to be encoded was &quot;A&quot;, which maps to &quot;Z&quot; in ciphertext. The shift given by the variable-toothed gear was 20; shifting to the left 20 positions gives the final ciphertext letter &quot;T&quot;, which is the same as the first digit in the check string.

At the end of the encoding cycle, all six key wheels are advanced by one position. The key wheels will then read &quot;BBBBBB&quot;, and the active pins will be &quot;QPONML&quot;. A new set of guide arms will interact with the drum, resulting in a different shift for the next encoding operation, and so on.

==Security==
The security of the M-209 was good for its time, but it was by no means perfect. As with the Lorenz Electric teletypewriter cipher machine (codenamed Tunny by the Allies), if a codebreaker got hold of two overlapping sequences, he would have a fingerhold into the M-209 settings, and its operation had some distinctive quirks that could be exploited. As of early 1943, German code breaking in World War II was able to read 10–30 percent of M-209 messages. It was considered adequate for tactical use and was still used by the US Army during the Korean War.

US researcher Dennis Ritchie has described a 1970s collaboration with James Reeds and Robert Morris on a ciphertext-only attack on the M-209 that could solve messages of at least 2,000–2,500 letters. Ritchie relates that, after discussions with the National Security Agency (NSA), the authors decided not to publish it, as they were told the principle was applicable to machines then still in use by foreign governments.

In 2004, German news site Heise Online published a feature about the German efforts to break the M-209.

==Production and usage==
The U.S. M-209s were produced at a rate of 400 units per day by Smith Corona Typewriter Company in Groton, NY, starting in 1942. Over 140,000 machines were produced. It gradually replaced the older M-94 tactical cipher.

The German SG-41 was supposed to have been a standard tactical cipher machine, but the Germans had only limited supplies of lightweight metals such as magnesium and aluminum, and it was simply too heavy for tactical use. Menzer also worked on two other cipher machines based on Hagelin technology, including a follow-on to the Enigma, the &quot;SG-39&quot;, and a simple but fairly strong handheld cipher machine, the &quot;Schlüsselkasten&quot; (&quot;Code Box&quot;). Neither of these machines reached production. Had the Menzer devices been put into service, they would have certainly caused trouble for Allied cryptanalysts, though they were no more uncrackable than the M-209.

After the war, Hagelin came up with an improved model of the M-209, designated the &quot;C-52&quot;. The C-52 featured a period of up to 2,756,205,443; wheels that could be removed and reinserted in a different order; and a printwheel with a mixed alphabet. However, the C-52 was one of the last generation of the classic cipher machines, as by that time the new digital technology was permitting the development of ciphers that were far more secure.

<text>The Canadian twenty-dollar note is one of the most common banknotes of the Canadian dollar; it is the primary banknote dispensed from Canadian automated teller machines (ATMs). The newest version, the Frontier Series polymer note, was released to the general public on November 7, 2012, replacing the banknote from the Canadian Journey Series.

==Frontier series==
The Frontier series $20 banknote was first issued on November 7, 2012. It is a polymer-based note featuring Queen Elizabeth II on the face and the Vimy Ridge memorial on the back. The window displays the Peace Tower.

On January 18, 2013, a Canadian botanist complained that a foreign maple leaf was used as the emblem on the polymer notes instead of the sugar maple that the country has on its national flag, along with the $50 and $100 notes.

After the death of Elizabeth II, the banknotes with her image continue to be legal tender. Despite initial speculation that Elizabeth&#x27;s successor, Charles III, might not appear in future designs, it was confirmed on the day of Charles&#x27; coronation, May 6, 2023, that the King would replace his mother on future $20 banknotes.

==History==

The Canadian $20 bill is one of the denominations of Canadian currency. The first $20 bill was issued in 1935, and features a portrait of Princess Elizabeth on the front and an agricultural allegory on the back, featuring a kneeling male exhibiting the produce of the field to a female agricultural figure.

All Canadian banknotes underwent a major redesign in 1991, partially to incorporate some of the latest anti-forgery methods. Notes continue to be improved, with another design revealed on August 25, 2004, and placed into circulation on September 29, 2004. Notes were printed on paper composed of pure cotton at two Ottawa companies contracted for the purpose: the Canadian Bank Note Company and BA International Inc., a part of the Giesecke &amp; Devrient GmbH group of companies.

Each note in the 1991 series is sprinkled with special green ink dots, called planchettes, that glow when exposed to ultraviolet light. The ink can be scraped off, so worn notes tend to have fewer, if any, glowing dots. These were replaced with more permanent ultraviolet-detected threads in the 2004-series notes, as well as an ink imprint of the coat of arms.

===Canadian Journey Series===

Introduced in 2004 and circulated until its replacement in 2012, the Canadian Journey Series 20-dollar note is predominantly green. The face features a portrait of Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, the royal arms of Canada, and a picture of the Centre Block of the Parliament buildings. Security features visible from the face include a holographic stripe along the left side, depicting the number &quot;20&quot; alternated with maple leaves; a watermark of the Queen&#x27;s portrait; and a broken-up number 20, which resolves itself when backlit. The back depicts artworks by Bill Reid, notably his sculptures &quot;The Raven and the First Men&quot; and &quot;Spirit of Haida Gwaii&quot;; it also has a quotation from Gabrielle Roy. The back also has a visible security feature: an interleaved metallic strip, reading &quot;20 CAN&quot; repeatedly along its length. Yellow dots representing the EURion constellation can be found on both sides (and on all 2001 series notes). As well as textured printing, the 2004 design incorporates a special tactile feature similar to Braille dots for the blind indicating the denomination. The 2004 $20 note was awarded Bank Note of the Year by the International Bank Note Society in 2005.

As with all modern Canadian banknotes, all text is in both English and French.

==Twenty-dollar view==
The view of Moraine Lake in Banff National Park from the top of the moraine rockpile is one of the most photographed locations in all of Canada. That view of the mountains behind the lake in Valley of the Ten Peaks is known as the Twenty-Dollar View, as Moraine Lake is featured on the backs of the 1969 and 1979 issues of the Canadian $20 note.

<doc id="743526" wikidata="Q7825548" url="?curid=743526" title="Torch Song Trilogy">
<text>Torch Song Trilogy is a collection of three plays by Harvey Fierstein rendered in three acts: &quot;International Stud&quot;, &quot;Fugue in a Nursery&quot;, and &quot;Widows and Children First!&quot; The story centers on Arnold Beckoff, a Jewish homosexual, drag queen, and torch singer who lives in New York City in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The four-hour play begins with a soliloquy in which he explains his cynical disillusionment with love.

== Characters ==
* Lady Blues: a character who appears between scenes in &quot;International Stud&quot;. According to Fierstein’s stage directions, she is to be “dressed in period, [singing] a torch song in the manner of Helen Morgan or Ruth Etting.&quot; 
* Arnold Beckoff: the central character of the play. In the stage directions, Fierstein playfully describes him as a &quot; (someone who complains habitually) of great wit and want.&quot; 
* Ed Reiss: Arnold’s bisexual lover and friend. He is “thirty-five [and] very handsome.” 
* Young Stud: a young man who Arnold hooks up with in the backroom of the International Stud. He has no speaking lines.
* Laurel: Ed’s lover and eventual fiancee.
* Alan: Arnold’s young lover, who is beaten to death by a group of homophobic boys.  
* David Beckoff: Arnold’s 15-year old adopted son, “a wonderfully bright and handsome boy.” 
* Ma: Arnold’s extremely strict, traditional Jewish mother. She is around 60.

==Summary==
Each act focuses on a different phase in Arnold&#x27;s life. In the first, Arnold meets Ed Reiss, who is uncomfortable with his bisexuality. This becomes an increasing source of conflict between the two, causing Ed to eventually leave Arnold and settle down with a woman named Laurel. Arnold is heartbroken because he still loves Ed. In the second, one year later, Arnold meets Alan, and the two settle down into a blissful existence that includes plans to adopt a child. The couple visits Ed and Laurel in their country home, where the group deals with tensions resulting from Ed and Arnold’s previous relationship. The segment ends with Laurel telling Arnold she and Ed are engaged. In the third, several years later, Arnold is a single father raising gay teenager David. It is revealed that just before receiving David from the state, Alan was the victim of a violent hate crime, resulting in his death and leaving Arnold to raise a child on his own. Ed is separated from Laurel, and stays at Arnold’s to help him. The play revolves around Arnold’s struggle to move on following Alan’s death as he is forced to deal with his mother&#x27;s (&quot;Ma&quot;) intolerance and disrespect when she visits from Florida.

The first act derives its name (&quot;International Stud&quot;) from an actual gay bar of the same name at 117 Perry Street in Greenwich Village in the 1960s and 1970s. The bar had a backroom where men engaged in anonymous sex. The backroom plays a central role in the act. The trilogy derives its title from the “torch” musical style which are “popular sentimental song[s] of unrequited love.” 

The award-winning and popular work broke new ground in the theatre: &quot;At the height of the post-Stonewall clone era, Harvey challenged both gay and straight audiences to champion an effeminate gay man&#x27;s longings for love and family.&quot;

==Production history==

The first staging of &quot;International Stud&quot; opened on February 2, 1978, at La MaMa, E.T.C., an off-off-Broadway theater, where it ran for two weeks. The off-Broadway production opened on May 22, 1978, at the Players Theatre, where it ran for 72 performances.

The first staging of &quot;Fugue in a Nursery&quot; opened at LaMama on February 1, 1979.

&quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot; first opened at the uptown Richard Allen Center on October 16, 1981, produced by The Glines. On January 15, 1982, it transferred to the Actors&#x27; Playhouse in Greenwich Village, where it ran for 117 performances, produced by The Glines. The cast included Fierstein as Arnold, Joel Crothers as Ed, Paul Joynt as Alan, Matthew Broderick as David, Diane Tarleton as Laurel/Lady Blues and Estelle Getty as Mrs. Beckoff.

The Broadway production, directed by Peter Pope, opened on June 10, 1982, at the Little Theatre, where it ran for 1,222 performances and 8 previews. Fierstein, Joynt, Tarleton, and Getty were joined by Court Miller as Ed and Fisher Stevens as David and Susan Edwards as Lady Blues. Later in the run, David Garrison and Jonathan Hadary portrayed Arnold, Craig Sheffer was cast as Alan, and Barbara Barrie replaced Getty.

The play won Fierstein two Tony Awards, for Best Play (with John Glines&#x27; historic Tony speech that acknowledged his lover and co-producer Larry Lane) and Best Actor in Play; two Drama Desk Awards, for Outstanding New Play and Outstanding Actor in a Play; and the Theatre World Award.

The West End production starring Antony Sher, with Barbara Rosenblat, Rupert Frazer (Ed), Belinda Sinclair (Laurel), Rupert Graves (Alan), Ian Sears (David) and Miriam Karlin (Mrs Beckoff) opened on October 1, 1985, at Albery Theatre on St. Martin&#x27;s Lane, where it ran for slightly more than seven months.

In 2006, the 25th anniversary production of &quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot; was produced by the Gallery Players in Brooklyn; Harvey Fierstein was one of the founding members of the Players. Seth Rudetsky played Arnold in the production, directed by Stephen Nachamie.

In late January 2009, it was revived at the American Theatre of Actors Sargent Theatre in New York City, by Black Henna Productions. Directed by Malini Singh McDonald, the production ran as a limited engagement until February 1, 2009, with each act being performed separately on weeknights and the entire series running on Saturdays and Sundays. The cast featured Cas Marino as Arnold, Ian M. McDonald as Ed, Susan Erenberg as Lady Blues, Christian Thomas as Alan, Amie Backner as Laurel, Chris Kelly as David, and Mary Lynch as Mrs. Beckoff.

The play was also revived at the Menier Chocolate Factory in London in 2012, with David Bedella playing Arnold.

&quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot; was produced by The Studio Theatre in Washington, D.C., as part of its subscription series in September and October 2013. It was directed by Michael Kahn, artistic director of The Shakespeare Theatre, also in Washington, D.C.

In the fall of 2017, a significantly revised version of the play, cut down by Fierstein from its original four-plus hours to two hours and forty-five minutes and retitled simply &quot;Torch Song&quot;, was produced Off Broadway by Second Stage Theatre, with Michael Urie as Arnold and Mercedes Ruehl as Mrs. Beckoff, and directed by Moises Kaufman. In October 2018, the Urie-led production transferred to the Hayes Theater on Broadway. The revival-transfer had its first preview on October 9, 2018, and had its opening performance on November 1, 2018. The production had its final performance on January 6, 2019, playing 26 previews and 77 regular performances.

In December 2018 (shortly before closing), the producers of the Broadway revival led by Richie Jackson announced a national tour starting in late 2019 at the Center Theater Group in Los Angeles, starring Michael Urie as Arnold Beckoff. In London in 2019, the full three-act play was the first production in the Turbine Theatre’s inaugural season, opening on August 22. It was presented by Bill Kenwright and ran until October 13.

On January 25th, 2022, a new production in Spanish opened at Teatro Milan, in Mexico City. This currently running production is led by award winning actors Rogelio Suarez as Arnold and Anahi Allue as Ma. It is directed by Alejandro Vilallobos in his directorial debut and produced by Gabriel Guevara; the cast included Jose Peralta as David.

Hoboken Library produced a staged reading of &quot;&#x27;Torch Song Trilogy: Widows And Children First’&quot; on August 28th, 2021. It featured NYC cabaret luminary Sidney Myer as Arnold, Florence Pape as Mrs. Beckoff, Michael Stever as Ed, Logann Grayce as David and was directed by Ethan Galvin.

== Casts ==
==Reception and impact==
&quot;International Stud&quot; first premiered in 1978 at La MaMa, where Fierstein made his professional acting debut in Andy Warhol&#x27;s play &quot;Pork&quot; in 1971. Fierstein has spoken about the difficulty he faced as an openly gay playwright. In an archived 1982 interview with &quot;Playbill&quot; republished to commemorate the show’s anniversary, he reminisced on the attitude producers and critics took towards his work: “Fabulous writer. Fabulous play. But gay. Goodbye.” Mel Gussow of The New York Times panned the play as a &quot;sincere but sentimentalized view of a transvestite extremes.&quot; Despite the criticism, Ellen Stewart, founder of La MaMa, chose to produce &quot;A Fugue in the Nursery&quot; and &quot;Widows and Children First&quot;! in 1979, though she personally found the work &quot;too talky.&quot; The Glines, a nonprofit organization dedicated to forwarding gay-themed cultural endeavors, financially supported Fierstein in reworking the three one-act plays as a singular theatrical event, which became &quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot; and earned excited praise from Mel Gussow. &quot;Arnold&#x27;s story becomes richer as it unfolds,&quot; he wrote, saying that Fierstein&#x27;s performance &quot;[was] an act of compelling virtuosity.&quot;

Writing in The Boston Phoenix, Don Shewey declared that &quot;the trilogy proves to be a masterpiece — it’s gay theater&#x27;s gift to American drama.&quot; He observed that the trilogy presents &quot;gay life not as an isolated phenomenon but in constant relation to the society at large, a society whose sexual values have undergone a general upheaval, leaving everyone — gays and straights alike — struggling to learn the new rules.&quot; Shewey concluded by stating that while &quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot; raises many questions, &quot;it doesn’t provide answers — only a model of how to come to terms with our common struggle for self-acceptance and (above all) love.&quot;

Theatre scholar Jordan Schildcrout notes that some critics viewed &quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot; as &quot;the most truly conservative play to come along in years&quot; because of its focus on &quot;fidelity and family&quot; (Jack Kroll), while others declared the play a radical breakthrough because of its forthright depiction of gay sexuality, gay youth, and gay families during an era of political backlash against the gay rights movement. Today, the play is primarily remembered as a groundbreaking moment for LGBTQ theatre. It is lauded for touching on issues such as gay marriage and adoption before they were acceptable. In a 2018 review revisiting the play, &quot;PopMatters&quot; writer Elizabeth Woronzoff remarked that &quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot; laid the groundwork for many modern queer television shows such as &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, &quot;Modern Family&quot;, and &quot;Will and Grace&quot;.

Additionally, the play addressed intersectionality in a newfound way. The inclusion of both the Jewish and queer identities allowed for the representation and (arguably) rejection of the stereotypes associated with each group. According to critic John Simon in a critique published in New York Magazine, the play highlights both the Jewish, melancholic humor and homosexual, flamboyant humor. Still, Simon argues that Fierstein rejects the common stereotypes of both identities and incites the audience to practice &quot;warm empathy&quot; towards every character.

==Film adaptation==
Fierstein adapted his play for a feature film, released in 1988. It was directed by Paul Bogart and starred Fierstein (Arnold), Anne Bancroft (Ma Beckoff), Matthew Broderick (Alan), Brian Kerwin (Ed), and Eddie Castrodad (David).

<doc id="743534" wikidata="Q889373" url="?curid=743534" title="Boeing E-7 Wedgetail">
<text>The Boeing E-7 Wedgetail, also marketed as the Boeing 737 AEW&amp;C, is a twin-engine airborne early warning and control aircraft based on the Boeing 737 Next Generation design. It has a fixed, active electronically scanned array radar antenna instead of a rotating one as with the 707-based Boeing E-3 Sentry. The E-7 was designed for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) under &quot;Project Wedgetail&quot; and designated E-7A Wedgetail.

The 737 AEW&amp;C has also been selected by the Turkish Air Force (under &quot;Project Peace Eagle&quot;, Turkish: &quot;Barış Kartalı&quot;, designated &quot;E-7T&quot;, the Republic of Korea Air Force (&quot;Project Peace Eye&quot;, ), and the United Kingdom (designated Wedgetail AEW1). In April 2022, the United States Air Force announced that the E-7 will be replacing the E-3 beginning in 2027.

==Design and development==
As early as 1986, the Australian Department of Defence evaluated industry proposals for airborne surveillance and early warning systems. In 1994, further studies led to the approval of the first phase of &quot;Project AIR 5077&quot;. In 1996, Australia issued a request for proposal (RFP) for the aircraft for the RAAF under &quot;Project Wedgetail&quot;, which refers to the indigenous eagle. In 1999, Australia awarded Boeing Integrated Defense Systems a contract to supply four AEW&amp;C aircraft with options for three additional aircraft.

The 737 AEW&amp;C is roughly similar to the 737-700ER. It uses the Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems Multi-role Electronically Scanned Array (MESA) radar. The electronically scanned AEW and surveillance radar is located on a dorsal fin on top of the fuselage, dubbed the &quot;top hat&quot;, and is designed for minimal aerodynamic effect. The radar is capable of simultaneous air and sea search, fighter control and area search, with a maximum range of over 600 km (look-up mode). The MESA radar is fixed, unlike the hydraulically-rotated AN/APY-1/2 of the E-3 Sentry, which the 737 AEW&amp;C is set to replace. Despite this, the radar is still able to offer 360-degree azimuth scan using two broadside (side-emitting) electronic manifold arrays, each covering two 120° sectors to starboard and port, and an end-fire array housed within the top hat that covers a 60° front and aft of the aircraft.

The radar antenna array also serves as an ELINT array, with a maximum range of over 850 km at altitude. Radar signal processing equipment and a central computer are installed directly below the antenna array.

Other modifications include ventral fins to counterbalance the radar and countermeasures mounted on the nose, wingtips and tail. In-flight refueling is via a receptacle on top of the forward fuselage. The cabin has eight operator consoles with sufficient space for four more. The Australian fleet will operate ten consoles with space for two more, four on the starboard side and six on the port side.

==Operational history==
===Australia===
Australia ordered four AEW&amp;C aircraft with options for three additional aircraft, two of which have since been taken up. The first two Wedgetails were assembled, modified and tested in Seattle, Washington, while the remainder were modified by Boeing Australia, with deliveries once set to begin in 2006. Boeing and Northrop teamed with Boeing Australia, and BAE Systems Australia. Boeing Australia provides training, maintenance and support, BAE provides EWSP systems, Electronic Support Measures (ESM) systems and ground support systems.

In June 2006, the Australian Minister for Defence, Brendan Nelson, stated that the Wedgetail was delayed despite Boeing&#x27;s prior assurance that work was on schedule. Boeing announced an 18-month delay due to problems integrating radar and sensor systems, and did not expect delivery until early 2009. Boeing incurred $770 million (~$ in ) in charges over the delay in 2006. In June 2008, Boeing announced a further delay due to integration issues with the radar and Electronic Support Measure (ESM) systems.

In November 2009, Boeing delivered the first two 737 AEW&amp;Cs to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). These aircraft remained Boeing owned and operated prior to the RAAF&#x27;s formal acceptance in May 2010. The RAAF accepted its sixth and last 737 AEW&amp;C in June 2012. All RAAF Wedgetails are operated by No. 2 Squadron RAAF and based at RAAF Base Williamtown. In November 2012, the Wedgetail achieved Initial Operational Capability.
On 1 April 2014, the Wedgetail&#x27;s first operational sortie occurred in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, helping control maritime patrol aircraft off Western Australia&#x27;s coast. On 1 October 2014, a Wedgetail conducted the first Australian sortie over Iraq supporting coalition forces conducting airstrikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). In May 2015, the Wedgetail fleet achieved final operational capability (FOC).

In November 2015, the Wedgetail performed the longest Australian command and control mission in a war zone during a 17-hour, 6-minute combat mission, requiring two air-to-air refuelings to stay aloft. Australian Wedgetail crews routinely perform 13-hour missions. In early April 2016, Rotation 5 of aircrew and maintenance personnel that had been operating the RAAF Wedgetail in the Middle East, achieved a record 100 percent mission success rate in Coalition operations against ISIS. The E-7A successfully conducted all 36 missions, each lasting upwards of 12 hours, amounting to nearly 500 hours of flying for the one aircraft. The final Wedgetail rotation to the Middle East ended in early 2019.

In October 2023, an Australian Wedgetail was deployed to Europe to contribute to international efforts to protect the flow of supplies to Ukraine following the Russian invasion of the country. This deployment was scheduled to last for six months. The Wedgetail returned to Australia in early April 2024.

The Australian Government&#x27;s &quot;2024 Integrated Investment Program&quot; included a commitment to allocate $A5 billion to $A7 billion to replace the Wedgetail fleet between the 2024-25 and 2033-34 financial years.

===Turkey===
Four Boeing 737 AEW&amp;C Peace Eagle aircraft along with ground support systems were ordered by the Turkish Air Force, with an option for two more. Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) is the Peace Eagle&#x27;s primary subcontractor, performing parts production, testing, aircraft assembly and conversion. Another Turkish subcontractor, HAVELSAN, is responsible for ground support elements, system analysis and software support. HAVELSAN is the only foreign company licensed by the U.S. Government to receive critical source codes. Peace Eagle 1 was modified and tested by Boeing in the US. Peace Eagle 2, 3 and 4 were modified and tested at TAI&#x27;s facilities in Ankara, Turkey, in partnership with Boeing and several Turkish companies. In 2006, the four Peace Eagles were scheduled to be delivered in 2008.

In September 2007, Boeing completed the first Peace Eagle test flight. In June 2008, it was announced that Peace Eagle 2, the second 737 AEW&amp;C, had completed modifications. Flight and mission system checks were completed in the third quarter of 2008. In 2013, Israel delivered EW equipment for the Peace Eagle under US pressure. On 21 February 2014, the first Peace Eagle, named &quot;Kuzey&quot; (meaning North), was formally accepted by the Turkish Air Force. The remaining three aircraft are named &quot;Güney&quot; (South), &quot;Doğu&quot; (East) and &quot;Batı&quot; (West). The fourth and final Peace Eagle was delivered in December 2015.

In IDEF 2023 was a signed project contract, for the modernization of the E-7 Peace Eagle aircraft in the inventory of Turkish Air Force to meet the current operational needs of Air Force and to eliminate the obsolescence in the software. Within the scope of modernization, the aircraft will be equipped with IFF Mode 5 Responder, Karetta CRPA Antenna, Mission Computer Hardware developed by Aselsan.

===South Korea===

In November 2006, Boeing won a $1.6 billion contract with South Korea to deliver four aircraft by 2012. Boeing beat the other entrant, IAI Elta&#x27;s Gulfstream G550-based aircraft, which was eliminated from the competition in August 2006. The first &quot;Peace Eye&quot; aircraft was delivered to Gimhae Air Base, Busan for acceptance testing in August 2011 with the remaining three aircraft delivered every six months until 2012. The second aircraft was modified into an AEW&amp;C configuration by Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI), then delivered to Gimhae Air Base in December 2011. After receiving AEW&amp;C modifications by KAI, the third aircraft was delivered in May 2012 to Gimhae Air Base. The fourth aircraft was delivered in October 2012.

In 2023, South Korea initiated a competitive program to acquire four additional AEW&amp;C aircraft. The Boeing E-7, Saab Global Eye, and a L3Harris Gulfstream-based variant are competing for the contract. Final proposals were due in April 2024.

===United Kingdom===

In October 2018, the British Government announced that it was in talks with Boeing about the potential for the E-7 Wedgetail to replace its E-3D fleet. Talks about using the aircraft were also taking place with Australia. The apparent decision to proceed with procurement without a competition received some criticism, with the Ministry of Defence accused of displaying favouritism towards Boeing, while Saab voiced its opposition to the &quot;non-competitive&quot; deal as it could offer the Erieye system mounted on Airbus A330 MRTT aircraft. In March 2019, the UK signed a $1.98 billion (~$ in ) deal to purchase five E-7 Wedgetails. The aircraft will be designated the &quot;Wedgetail AEW1&quot;.

Airframe modification was expected to be performed by Marshall Aerospace, but it withdrew in May 2020, thus Boeing selected STS Aviation Group&#x27;s UK branch on 20 May 2020. Two of the five aircraft are to be converted commercial airliners and the rest are to be new. Each conversion takes about 24 months, with work on the first aircraft starting in 2021 and the last to be completed in 2026. In June 2020, the first Wedgetail delivery was expected in 2023. 

In December 2020, &quot;Air Forces Monthly&quot; reported that the UK was considering reducing its Wedgetail purchase from five to three aircraft and stated that such a move &quot;could often mean just one aircraft would be available for operational tasking.&quot; The 2021 Integrated Defence Review confirmed the reduced order of three aircraft. In late 2022, it was reported that initial operating capability for the aircraft had slipped to 2024. In February 2023, Air Chief Marshal Michael Wigston stated that the order of three aircraft may gradually rise to five.

===United States===
In February 2021 General Kenneth S. Wilsbach, the Commander of the United States Pacific Air Forces, proposed that the USAF rapidly acquire E-7s to replace the E-3s deployed to the Indo-Pacific region. In March 2022, Wilsbach stated that the E-3 had insufficient detection range against aircraft like the Chinese Chengdu J-20. In April 2021, &quot;Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology&quot; reported that Gen. Jeffrey Harrigian, commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe and Air Forces Africa, also voiced support for a near-term E-7 acquisition. In October 2021, the USAF published a &quot;Notice of Contract Action&quot;, stating its intent to award Boeing a sole-source contract to study the E-7 to determine if it can meet USAF configuration standards and mandates.

In April 2022, the U.S. Air Force announced that the E-7 would replace the E-3, as it &quot;is the only platform capable of meeting the requirements for the Defense Department&#x27;s tactical battle management, command and control and moving target indication capabilities within the timeframe needed...&quot; In 2023, an initial $1.2 billion contract was awarded to develop two new US-specific variants of the E-7. A final production decision for a total fleet of 26 aircraft is planned for 2025, with the first USAF E-7 entering service in 2027.

===NATO===
In 2022, NATO issued a &quot;Request for Information&quot; (RFI) for a capability to replace its 14 E-3A AWACS aircraft by 2035, with an &quot;initial operational capability&quot; by 2031. Boeing stated that it had responded to the request, offering an E-7-based solution. Saab and Northrop Grumman also responded to the RFI, offering, the GlobalEye and the Northrop Grumman E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, respectively. In November 2023, NATO stated that they are to procure six E-7s to replace their E-3s, to begin operations from 2031. The E-7 is expected to be based at Geilenkirchen and could operate from several forward locations across Europe.

===Potential customers===
====Saudi Arabia====
As of December 2023, Saudi Arabia is in the middle of a two-phase mid-life upgrade to its existing fleet of E-3 Sentry aircraft. In August 2022, the U.S. Air Force revealed that Saudi Arabia has expressed interest in the E-7.

====Canada====
In April 2024, Canada announced it would be investing CA$5 billion on AEW&amp;C capabilities. The GlobalEye may be a competitor to the E-7.

===Failed bids===
====Italy====
In 2004, the Italian Air Force was considering the purchase of a total of 14 Wedgetail and P-8 MMA aircraft, with aircraft support to be provided by Alitalia. In 2008, owing to budget constraints, Italy chose not to proceed with either aircraft and chose a smaller, less expensive, interim solution in place of the P-8, the ATR 72MP. In 2012, Italy acquired two Gulfstream G550 CAEW as part of a counter-deal to Israel&#x27;s $1 billion (~$ in ) order for 30 Alenia Aermacchi M-346 advanced jet trainers, followed by an additional order of two more aircraft in 2022.

====United Arab Emirates====
The Wedgetail was a competitor for the United Arab Emirates&#x27; AEW&amp;C program in 2007. In 2015, UAE selected the Saab GlobalEye over the Wedgetail and the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye.

====Qatar====
In 2014, Qatar stated it planned to purchase three 737 AEW&amp;C aircraft. In 2018, Qatar decided not to proceed with the planned purchase.

<text>Inverness Caledonian Thistle Football Club, commonly known as Caley Thistle, Inverness CT or just Inverness, is a professional football club based in Inverness, Scotland. The team competes in Scottish League One, the third tier of the Scottish Professional Football League, and plays its home games at Caledonian Stadium.

Inverness Caledonian Thistle won the Scottish Cup in 2015, were runners-up in 2023 and were also runners-up in the Scottish League Cup in 2014. They have also won the Scottish Challenge Cup three times and the Scottish Football League First Division twice. Its highest Premiership position is third in 2014–15.

== History ==
=== Formation and early years ===
Before 1994, there were three football clubs in Inverness competing in the Highland League: Clachnacuddin, Caledonian, and Inverness Thistle. Inverness Union, which competed in the Highland League in the late 19th Century, merged with Inverness Thistle in 1895.

All three clubs had won a number of local titles, and Inverness Thistle narrowly missed out on being elected into the Scottish League in 1973. In 1993 the league agreed to expand by an extra two teams, and improved road links to Inverness now meant that competing in national competitions was more possible.

Caledonian Thistle F.C. was formed in August 1994 from the merger of Caledonian and Inverness Thistle (both formed in 1885), with an objective of taking up one of the two available places in the Scottish League. The merger was opposed by some supporters of both clubs, with Caledonian fans staging a number of protests, but the merger went through and the new club was selected to the Scottish Third Division along with fellow Highland team, Ross County.

Caledonian Thistle started 1994–95 with a game against Arbroath on 13 August 1994, which ended in a 5–2 win at Telford Street Park, the former home ground of Caledonian. Alan Hercher scored Caledonian Thistle&#x27;s first league goal, and went on to complete a hat-trick. The club eventually finished sixth in the Third Division, and followed this up with a third-place finish in 1995–96. Before the start of the 1996–97 season the club changed its name to Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C. Part of the application to join the Scottish League was a commitment to move to a new stadium and, a year later than originally planned, Caley moved to the newly built Caledonian Park in November 1996. With a new name and new stadium, the club finished 1996–97 as Third Division champions, earning promotion to the Second Division. The club spent two seasons in the Second Division. After a closely fought campaign, they finished runners-up to Livingston in Season 1998–99, securing promotion to the First Division.

=== First Division (1999–2004) ===
The club first came to national prominence after their Scottish Cup victories over Celtic in 2000 and 2003: winning 3–1 at Celtic Park, resulting in the headline &quot;Super Caley Go Ballistic Celtic Are Atrocious&quot; in &quot;The Sun&quot; which is now framed in the foyer of Caledonian Stadium, and 1–0. Inverness also knocked other SPL teams out of cup competitions, including Motherwell and Hearts. Over the first ten years of their existence the club had been responsible for a total of 12 &#x27;shocks&#x27; and as a result had gained themselves a reputation as being &quot;giant killers&quot;. On 25 February 2007, Inverness&#x27;s run of cup victories over Celtic came to an end following two goals in the last two minutes of their fifth round tie at Caledonian Stadium. Having led 1–0 for the majority of the game thanks to a Graham Bayne goal, Steven Pressley equalised before Kenny Miller netted the winner in stoppage time. However, another victory against Celtic occurred on 16 December 2007, this time in the league, when the team came from being 2–0 down to win 3–2, with goals scored by John Rankin, David Proctor and Don Cowie.

Season 2003–2004 could be regarded as the club&#x27;s most successful up to that point. In November 2003, they defeated Airdrie United 2–0 with goals from Steve Hislop and David Bingham to win the Scottish Challenge Cup, and also reached the Scottish Cup semi-final, losing a replay 3–2 to Dunfermline Athletic after a 1–1 draw at Hampden Park. However, the greatest achievement was on the final day of the season, when Inverness defeated St Johnstone 3–1, with goals from Paul Ritchie, David Bingham and Barry Wilson and, as a result, pipped Clyde to the First Division title. This made the club eligible for promotion to the Scottish Premier League (SPL). However, SPL rules at that time stated that all member clubs must have a stadium with a minimum capacity of 10,000 seats. Caledonian Stadium did not meet this criterion, leaving the club&#x27;s Board with a dilemma: either to remain in the First Division (like Falkirk the previous season) or to groundshare with Aberdeen, over 100 miles (160 km) away. After consulting with supporters, the Board decided the &#x27;sacrifice&#x27; of one season in Aberdeen would be an acceptable compromise to ensure Premier League participation for the club.

=== 2001 Name Change Ballot ===

In late January 2001, following Inverness&#x27; Scottish Cup match against Ayr United, in which &quot;Caley Thistle&quot; overturned a 0–3 deficit to win 4–3, fans were asked to fill in a voting card on whether the club should change their name to reflect Inverness&#x27;s recently granted city status. However, the name change was overwhelmingly rejected by the fans in attendance by 412 to 1,067, mostly on the grounds of the amount of success they had under the Inverness Caledonian Thistle name, namely it being just shy of a year since they had beaten Celtic in the Scottish Cup. The name Inverness City was registered by the club, seemingly in case of a change of heart within the voters, however it was soon dropped when Inverness CT won the Scottish First Division in 2004, and were promoted to the Scottish Premier League. With the name now free to use, in 2006 now defunct local amateur side Inverness City were born, and competed in the lower echelons of the Scottish Football Tier System, playing in the North Caledonian Football League and later the North Junior Superleague, before folding in 2019 due to lack of a home ground.

=== Scottish Premier League (2004–2009) ===
A change in SPL rules during the 2004–05 season reduced the stadium seating requirement to 6,000 seats for SPL membership. The Caledonian Stadium was rendered a valid SPL venue after a rapid ground expansion, with two new stands added. The stadium was renamed as the Tulloch Caledonian Stadium in honour of the local building firm that completed the work in only 47 working days. The chairman of Tulloch, David Sutherland, was also chairman of the club at the time and remains a major shareholder. The club returned to playing in Inverness, defeating Dunfermline 2–0 in their first SPL game in their own ground on 29 January 2005, thanks to goals from Barry Wilson and then player-manager Craig Brewster.

A significant event in the club&#x27;s history was the signing of Romanian international Marius Niculae. Niculae was involved in the club&#x27;s 2007–08 campaign and played at UEFA Euro 2008, before leaving for Dinamo București. He later became involved in a dispute with the club over a share of the transfer fee that was not paid to him when he left. As a result, Inverness were ordered by FIFA to pay £133,000 to the player. The club appealed the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and in November 2011, the club won their appeal.

During season 2008–09 season, the team incurred a number of bad results and struggled near the bottom of the SPL. Eventually, manager Craig Brewster was sacked after a run of seven consecutive defeats, ending with a 1–0 loss to Hamilton Academical. This was the first time the club had sacked a manager, and the fans had previously voiced concern about Brewster&#x27;s ability. Brewster was replaced by former England international Terry Butcher, who was unable to prevent the club&#x27;s relegation, despite an initial improvement in results. Inverness Caledonian Thistle&#x27;s tenure in the SPL eventually ended in May 2009 after suffering a 1–0 home defeat to Falkirk. Their final total of 37 points remains the highest ever for a team finishing bottom of the SPL.

=== Return to the First Division (2009–2010) ===
After a slow start to their first season back in the First Division, which looked set to be won at a canter by runaway leaders Dundee who were 15 points ahead in January, Inverness put together a run of form which saw them go on a 21-match unbeaten run. On 21 April 2010, Inverness secured promotion back to the SPL with two games to spare after Dundee lost to Raith Rovers. Inverness became the first team in ten years to secure an immediate return to the SPL. The team went on to celebrate their promotion with a 7–0 win at Ayr United, their biggest ever away win. On the final day of the season, Inverness beat Dundee 1–0, winning the league by 12 points.

=== Return to the SPL/Premiership (2010–2017) ===

Having won the 2009–10 First Division title in their first year back in the division since 2003–04, Inverness competed in the top tier of Scottish football from 2010 to 2017. In 2013–14, the club reached their first major final – the Scottish League Cup – losing on penalties to Aberdeen. They then beat Falkirk in the final of the Scottish Cup in 2015. That same season, Inverness secured entry to European competition for the first time, with a best-ever third-place finish in the Premiership.

As part of the push for promotion in the 2009–10 season, Inverness went on an unbeaten away run in the league that continued through the entire 2010 calendar year, culminating in a 1–1 draw against Hearts at Tynecastle on 18 December. This extraordinary sequence ended in defeat at St Johnstone on 2 January 2011 when the Perth side won by a single goal. At the split, Inverness narrowly missed out on a top six spot, eventually finishing in a club record-equalling 7th place. However, two years later, they would finish even higher.

During the 2012–13 season, a 3–0 win over Hibernian on 8 December 2012 saw them rise to second place in the SPL (behind Celtic), their then, highest ever league position.

Continued good form over the course of the season consolidated the club&#x27;s position in the top-half of the table. Victory over Highland derby rivals Ross County on 16 March elevated Inverness CT onto an almost unassailable points-total in their quest for a maiden &#x27;top-6&#x27; finish. This achievement was confirmed the following day as the club benefited from a favourable result in the Sunday SPL fixture.
This guarantee of a &#x27;top-6&#x27; place ensured that the 2012–13 Scottish Premier League season would see Inverness CT record, their then, highest ever finishing league position.

Ultimately, Inverness CT finished in 4th place, narrowly missing Europa League qualification on the final day of the season, succumbing to a 1–0 defeat from local rivals Ross County.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ross County beat Inverness CT for the first time since 2009, which helped edge their Highland rivals out of a Europa League spot for season 2013/14.&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Inverness CT began the inaugural season (2013–14 Scottish Premiership) of the revamped SPFL Scottish Premiership with a 3–0 win over St Mirren. This result saw the club take pole-position in the league table. They remained top of the league until the 9th game of the season when they dropped to 2nd place following a loss at St Johnstone.

On 11 November 2013, Hibernian reached a compensation deal with Inverness for Terry Butcher to move to the club, alongside assistant manager Maurice Malpas.

After an extensive recruitment process, on 4 December 2013, John Hughes was unveiled as the new manager of the club. In January 2014, Russell Latapy was appointed as Hughes&#x27; assistant manager.

In February 2014, Inverness defeated Hearts in the Scottish League Cup semi-final. Inverness struck first with Greg Tansey firing the Highland side into the lead. Jamie Hamill then scored 2 goals in 2 minutes and gave Hearts hope of reaching their second League Cup Final in two years. Just when Inverness were on the brink of defeat, Nick Ross equalised in the 94th minute and sent the game to extra time. After no goals being scored in extra time, Inverness clinched the win on penalties.

On 25 February, Inverness beat Ross County in Dingwall in the Highland Derby. The 3–0 win was the first time they had won a Highland Derby in Dingwall in the League since March 2003.
They also won the next derby 2–1 on 4 April. The game was also played in Dingwall.

On 16 March, Inverness and Aberdeen faced each other in the 2014 Scottish League Cup Final at Celtic Park in Glasgow. After tense 120 minutes the two teams lined up for a penalty shoot-out. Inverness missed their first 2 penalties with Billy Mckay&#x27;s penalty saved and Greg Tansey firing over the bar. Despite Nick Ross and Aaron Doran scoring their penalties Aberdeen won 4–2.

Inverness finished the season with a 2–0 win over St Johnstone thanks to second half goals from Ryan Christie and Greg Tansey.

Between May and September 2014, Inverness kept a series of consecutive clean sheets, enabling them to achieve a club record of 616 minutes without conceding a goal.

Further success followed that season, with a 1–0 victory away to Dundee, scored by Eddie Ofere, confirming a record third-place league finish for the club.
This also guaranteed Inverness qualifying for European football for the first time – competing in the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League.

=== Scottish Cup victory and European qualification (2014–2015) ===
Inverness Caledonian Thistle capped an extraordinary 2014–15 season by winning the Scottish Cup Final against Falkirk at Hampden Park. This result came after they had defeated Celtic in a tense semi-final.The Scottish Cup win was the club&#x27;s first major national trophy and the first won by any club from the Highlands and as of 2024 the only major trophy the club had won.
Furthermore, it entitled Inverness Caledonian Thistle to enter the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League in the Second qualifying round. The club were drawn against Romanian outfit FC Astra Giurgiu. An estimated 500 fans followed the team to Romania, watching the team grind out a 0–0 draw. However this was not enough to set up a tie against West Ham United in the next round, as the Romanians had narrowly beaten the Highlanders 1–0 in the first leg in Inverness.

=== Relegation and the Scottish Championship (2017–2024) ===

The team failed to carry the form from the previous season due to the loss of key players such as Marley Watkins, Graeme Shinnie and Edward Ofere. Furthermore, an approach from Dundee United to bring John Hughes to the &quot;Tangerines&quot; in October was rejected by Inverness, leaving Hughes frustrated. 
The club&#x27;s defence of the Scottish Cup began by beating Stirling Albion after a replay. In the following round, a Jordan Roberts goal against Motherwell set-up a tie against Hibernian. Inverness lost a replay to the Edinburgh club, who eventually went on to win the competition. Hughes left at the end of the season after mutually terminating his contract, citing a collapse in relations with the board.

Club captain Richie Foran was appointed as his successor, despite having no previous managerial experience. The club started the season scoring fifteen goals in four League Cup group games. They also recorded a 2–2 draw in the league against Celtic, the only club to take a point off the Glaswegians for close to a year. However, this good form dropped off, and Inverness did not win a league game from October until February – when a last-minute overhead kick from Billy Mckay lead to a 2–1 win over Rangers.

Inverness were relegated to the Scottish Championship on the final day of the 2016–17 season, despite recording a 3–2 victory over Motherwell. After Foran was sacked from his position, former manager John Robertson was appointed as his successor on 14 June 2017.

Inverness reached the 2017–18 Scottish Challenge Cup Final, after a 3–2 win over Northern Irish invitee side Crusaders at home, meaning the club&#x27;s would make their fourth cup final appearance, and John Robertson&#x27;s second challenge cup final at the club. Inverness went on to lift the cup on 24 March 2018, with Carl Tremarco scoring the only goal of the game seconds before the game was due to go into added time. Robertson became the first manager in the cup&#x27;s history to lift the trophy twice with the same club.

This cup win kick-started an unbeaten run of 13 games as Inverness went from lingering around the lower echelons of the table to mid-table. However, despite a late push, an injury-time equaliser in the final home game of the season against Dunfermline meant the club narrowly missed out on the promotion play-offs by just two points, finishing in 5th place despite winning 3–0 away to Greenock Morton on the final day, which would&#x27;ve confirmed a play-off slot had Dunfermlne either drawn or lost to Dumbarton.

In August 2018, the club was saddened to learn of the death of ex-player Alan Hercher at 52 years of age. He was the club&#x27;s first captain, goalscorer and hat-trick scorer – in their first league game against Arbroath. In tribute, a minute&#x27;s silence was held at Inverness&#x27; first home game of the 2018–19 Scottish Championship season against Ayr United which ended in a 0–0 draw.

In the new year, Inverness were doing better than they had the previous season, sitting in the play-off spots despite drawing nearly every game. The club beat rivals Ross County to progress into the quarter-finals of the Scottish Cup, and reached the semi-final after a last gasp winner from Aaron Doran against Dundee United. This was the 4th semi-final appearance for the club, after appearances in 2002–03, 2003–04 and 2014–15. They played Heart of Midlothian in the semi-final, but were defeated 3–0.

By the end of the season, Inverness had secured a play-off spot, after leapfrogging Ayr United into 3rd place. In the quarter-finals, Inverness defeated Ayr, winning 3–1 in the first leg, and drawing 1–1 in the second, securing a comfortable 4–2 aggregate win. But they lost to Dundee United in the semi-finals. In the first leg, at home, they lost 1–0 while down to 10 men after Liam Polworth was handed a straight red for an apparent high foot on Mark Connolly while making a clearance. In the away leg at Tannadice, Dundee United were awarded and scored a controversial penalty just before half time. The penalty was conceded by a Brad McKay handball, after it deflected off his heel. There was more controversy just after half time, when the referee did not see a handball, and John Robertson was sent to the stands for flicking a water-bottle in aggravation near the 4th official. Inverness lost 3–0, making 4–0 on aggregate. After the match, Robertson stated in an interview with the BBC on what punishments he would receive from the SFA for his actions:&quot;I don&#x27;t care. They [the SFA] can ban me for as long as they want. I&#x27;m going to start speaking out now because I&#x27;ve had enough of it.&quot;

July 2019 saw the beginning of the 25th anniversary celebrations: a new 3rd kit was announced as well as a special friendly game. The League Cup campaign was poor: an 11–10 loss on penalties to Peterhead was followed by wins over Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers, but for the third year on the trot the club failed to progress to the next round. The league, like the League Cup, started off disappointingly, with to a 4–1 defeat by Dundee United at Tannadice Park. However, the following weekend they won 2–1 at home against Arbroath. The game came one year after the death of the club&#x27;s first captain, Alan Hercher, who scored a hat-trick against the same opposition in the first (home) game of the club&#x27;s existence, almost 25 years before. This game saw the debut of the anniversary kit.

By the end of February, the club was close to securing a second-place finish, and potentially even winning title ahead of Dundee United, who were dropping crucial points. However, for the first time since the Second World War, the league was postponed: due to the coronavirus pandemic with the SPFL shut down all football in Scotland from the Premiership to local leagues. It was decided to finish the season as it stood, and to do away with the play-offs. This was met with controversy, as Inverness, Partick and Dundee planned on voting against this decision; however, Dundee changed their vote at the last minute, leading to the league standings being finalised. Had Dundee also voted no, the SPFL proposition would have failed and the playoffs would have taken place. Following this outcome, a league reconstruction proposal was made, which would have seen Inverness go up with Dundee United to form a 14 team Scottish Premiership, resulting in Partick being spared relegation into League One. However, as of 22 July 2020, the talks collapsed, with Hearts and Partick taking the matter to court and subsequently to an SFA tribunal.

In the 2020–21 season, Inverness finished in 5th place, narrowly missing out on the promotion play-offs despite spending the early part of the season in the relegation zone. On 30 April 2021, it was announced that the previous season&#x27;s Challenge Cup Final would not take place and instead the cup would be shared between Inverness and fellow finalists Raith Rovers.

In May 2021, John Robertson took up the role of the club&#x27;s Sporting Director. The following month, Billy Dodds was appointed as manager.

In the 2021–22 season, Inverness finished in fourth place, despite going through an 11-game winless spell between December and early March, and ultimately made it to the Premiership play-off final, but they were beaten 6–2 on aggregate by St Johnstone.

At the start of the 2022–23 season, Inverness brought in five new signings and a season-long loan. Daniel MacKay was loaned back to his boyhood club from Hibernian. The other signings were Max Ram, Steven Boyd, Zak Delaney, Nathan Shaw and the return of George Oakley.

In July 2022, Inverness made it out of the League Cup group stages for the first time since 2016, before being beaten 4–0 in the following round by Motherwell.

The club finished sixth in the Championship that season despite an eight game winless streak from October until the end of 2022.

=== Second Scottish Cup final ===
In April 2023, Inverness clinched a place in the Scottish Cup final for the second time in eight years, beating Falkirk 3–0. Billy Mckay scored a brace and Daniel MacKay netted the other. It was the first Inverness match that involved the use of VAR, which gave Inverness their opening goal from a penalty, after a Falkirk handball. In the final, Inverness played a treble-chasing Celtic. Despite Daniel MacKay scoring in the 85th minute, Inverness lost to Celtic by 3–1.

===Relegation to League One and Administration (2024–present)===
Inverness began the 2023–24 season in terrible form, losing eight of their opening ten games of the season in all competitions, resulting in manager Billy Dodds being sacked. Dodds was replaced with former Everton coach and Forest Green Rovers manager Duncan Ferguson.

Following Ferguson&#x27;s arrival results picked up slightly, but despite a January squad overhaul the club continued fighting relegation. Inverness finished the season in 9th place in the Scottish Championship, entering the relegation play offs. After beating Montrose 1–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals, Inverness lost 5–3 on aggregate to Hamilton Academical in the final, meaning Inverness were relegated to Scottish League One, the first time the club has played in the third tier since 1999.&lt;br&gt;

Following relegation, the club announced it was remaining full time, in addition to a highly controversial move of training facilities 136-miles south to Kelty Hearts&#x27; New Central Park. However, the move to Kelty was reversed following the resignation of Chairman Ross Morrison, with the club continuing to train at Fort George. On 13 August 2024, with the club on the brink of administration, they were briefly saved by local businessman and former chairman Alan Savage, who subsequently relieved Scot Gardiner as CEO, cancelled a controversial takeover proposal by Ketan Makwana&#x27;s Seventy7 Ventures, and cleared debts owed by the club to various sources, including shirt manufacturers Puma. However, despite the efforts to stabilise the club, it was revealed in October that the club was looking likely to head into administration, with £200,000 needed by October 16 to keep the club solvent until the end of the month, and £1.2m to make it to the end of the season.

Despite holding talks with multiple potential investors, most notably Anders Holch Povlsen, the owner of Danish football club FC Midtjylland, it was announced on 18 October 2024 that Inverness would be appointing administrators, becoming the first football club in Scotland to do so since Heart of Midlothian in 2013, the first in-season points deduction in Scottish football since Dunfermline in 2012–13 and the first team to enter administration in the SPFL era. On 22 October 2024 it was confirmed the club had officially entered administration, incurring an immediate 15 point deduction. The following day it was confirmed by the club that manager Duncan Ferguson, assistant manager Gary Bollan and goalkeeping coach Stuart Garden had left the club with immediate effect, with first team coach Scott Kellacher placed in charge of the side, with all time club top goalscorer Billy Mckay filling the role of assistant. On 24 October, despite it being announced that backroom staff were safe from redundancies, Adam Brooks, Cameron Ferguson, Wallace Duffy and Flynn Duffy were released from their contracts by the administrators, as well as Jack Newman&#x27;s loan from Dundee United being terminated.

On 4 November 2024, the club announced that they had received expressions of interest from 20 potential buyers.

== Kit history ==

In 2017 Inverness cut ties with Carbrini due to delays in manufacturing of replica kits, which angered many fans who had ordered their kits which took months to arrive at their homes. The kits were only available at JD Sports Stores, and did not become available to buy until a month into the 2016–17 season. Inverness partnered up with longtime supplier Errea in May 2017 in time for the 2017–18 season.

In August 2019 a 3rd Kit, which was given a limited release of less than 300, was launched. The kit featured 4 vertical stripes of red, black, white and blue, a silver crest, and the names of all the players who were with the team in the 1994–95 season, as well as featuring the anniversary logo used to promote the occasion and a one-off 25th anniversary sponsor.

In May 2020, it was revealed that the club&#x27;s contract with Erreà had run out as well as potentially the sponsorship by McEwan Fraser Legal. In the club&#x27;s fan podcast, The Wyness Shuffle, it was revealed by club chairman Ross Morrison that Inverness had signed a deal with German sports manufacturers Puma and further details would be disclosed by the club at a later date.

In October 2024, following the administration event, it was announced that the club were trying to get their deal with Puma torn up, due to previous CEO Scot Gardiner penning a deal which meant the club were paying over £100,000 per season on a 4 year deal with the manufacturer.

== Rivalries ==

=== Ross County ===
Inverness have had a long-standing rivalry with local club Ross County, who are situated a few miles north of Inverness in Dingwall. The rivalry began when both teams were elected to the SFL in the 1994–95 Season. They contest the Highland derby. Inverness are the dominant team within the derby with 27 wins to County&#x27;s 17.

=== Clachnacuddin ===
Inverness also has a long-lasting rivalry with Clachnacuddin, which goes back to before Caledonian and Inverness Thistle merged. All three teams were founding members of the Highland League, and all their grounds were close together in Inverness. This led to the City Derby. Though this rivalry is on a lesser scale than it was before the election of Inverness to the SFL, it still exists through pre-season friendlies. Inverness has 17 wins in this fixture, and Clach only two.

=== Aberdeen ===
A lesser derby fixture is the North derby between Inverness and Aberdeen, which is still regarded as a derby even though the clubs are over 100 miles apart. The rivalry started when Inverness were ground sharing with Aberdeen at Pittodrie Stadium in 2004 when Inverness first gained promotion to the top flight, and their ground was being improved to the standards required to be a SPL team.

By far the biggest game between the two was the 2014 Scottish League Cup Final at Celtic Park, where Inverness held Aberdeen to a 0–0 draw, but ultimately lost 4–2 on penalties. Aberdeen are the dominant team in the derby with 24 wins to 10.

== Stadium ==
The Highland Council contributed £900,000 towards the development of Caledonian Stadium. The stadium is situated beside the Moray Firth, in the shadow of the Kessock Bridge. Its construction was promised in their election to the Scottish Football League. The former ground of Caledonian, Telford Street, was used until the new stadium was complete. The stadium has 4 stands – The North Stand, The Jock McDonald Main Stand, The South Stand, and the small West Stand. Away supporters are housed in the South Stand, which can hold around 2200 supporters, as well as being given the West Stand and uncovered section of the Main Stand if demand is exceeded, however, if demand is not met, away supporters may be given the uncovered section in the Main Stand. The North and South stands were constructed in 2005 in order to meet SPL requirements. The West Stand was constructed in 2007, holding around 400. It was intended to be used as a singing section, however, the stand remained unused on most match days until early 2022, when a new group called Section 94 made use of it as a singing section.

In 2019, the stadium was gifted back to the club, and its original name of Caledonian Stadium returned.

=== Attendance ===

The club&#x27;s highest &#x27;home&#x27; (league) attendance actually occurred while they were groundsharing with Aberdeen at Pittodrie. With Inverness fans in the traditional home end, and Aberdeen fans filling the away end, a record attendance of 9,530 was set on 16 October 2004. This record may stand for some time, as the crowd that day was bigger than the current capacity of Caledonian Stadium.

The club&#x27;s highest cup attendance was also recorded in a venue other than their home ground. A crowd of 11,296 watched Inverness play Rangers on 9 March 1996 at Tannadice in Dundee. The game had been switched to Dundee as the club&#x27;s home ground (Telford Street Park at that time) was deemed unsuitable for the Scottish Cup quarter-final tie.

The highest attendance recorded at the Caledonian Stadium is 7,753 set on 20 January 2008 against Rangers.

In February 2021, the attendance record was beaten, albeit unofficially, by a joint effort between Inverness and Heart of Midlothian as a thanks for Inverness helping Hearts when they fell into administration in 2013. This generated revenue of over £10,000. Following this the club introduced a limited run of Matchday programmes for the game. The club stated they were going to use the revenue from the ticket and programme sales to buy a new cover for the pitch after the club&#x27;s start in 2021 was plagued by postponements due to rain and heavy snow. Towards the end of the match, which ended 1–1, it was announced that 11,356 tickets had been sold. At the time, matches were being played behind closed doors due to the Coronavirus pandemic.

== Managers ==
List of Inverness Caledonian Thistle managers and head coaches:

=== Managerial history ===
Sergei Baltacha had been manager of Caledonian prior to the merger and he carried on as Caledonian Thistle manager after the merger in 1994. He remained in charge for only one season, leaving in 1995 to be closer to his family in Perth. Baltacha was replaced by Huntly manager Steve Paterson, who to date is the club&#x27;s longest-serving manager. During his seven and a half years as manager, from the summer of 1995 to December 2002, Paterson succeeded in taking the club to the Scottish Football League First Division. He also steered ICT to their famous 3–1 Scottish Cup victory against Celtic in 2000. In November 2002, Paterson was strongly linked to the vacant manager&#x27;s position at Dundee United. However, he chose to stay with Inverness for another month, after which he left, along with assistant Duncan Shearer, to become manager of Aberdeen.

The club also had a director of football, with former player Graeme Bennett appointed while Steve Paterson was manager. Paterson was replaced by former Hearts player John Robertson, whose two-year reign as manager was an exceptionally successful period. Under Robertson, Inverness won the 2003–04 Scottish Challenge Cup, gained another Scottish Cup victory over Celtic, this time 1–0 thanks to a goal on the stroke of half time by club record scorer Dennis Wyness and won the First Division Championship, taking the club into the SPL. Robertson eventually left to become Hearts manager and was replaced by Dunfermline&#x27;s Craig Brewster as player-manager. Brewster succeeded in keeping the club in the SPL. He also introduced new training regimes to increase player fitness and was successful in steering the club to good results against a number of established Premier League sides, including Rangers, Celtic, Motherwell, Hearts and Hibs. After a period at the club of just over thirteen months he left to become the new Dundee United manager after the sacking of Gordon Chisholm.

Former player Charlie Christie was appointed manager on 27 January 2006, after a successful spell as caretaker manager following the departure of Brewster, during which time Inverness achieved three wins out of three games played, including a record victory for the club in the SPL as they beat Falkirk 4–1 away from home. He resigned on 19 August 2007 due to the pressures of the job, and because he believed it to be the correct decision for him and his family. He has now resumed his former role, running the club&#x27;s Centenary Club lottery. A short time after Christie resigned, Craig Brewster was reappointed. This was a controversial decision by the club, as Brewster had left to manage Dundee United only 18 months previously. He was eventually sacked in January 2009, after a run of seven league defeats.

Brewster&#x27;s successor, the former England international Terry Butcher was appointed on 27 January 2009, along with Maurice Malpas as his assistant. Terry Butcher managed in over 200 matches for the club, the 100th taking place on Friday 6 October 2012, in the 3–1 win over Ross County in the first SPL Highland derby. In November 2013, after nearly five years at Inverness, Hibernian reached a compensation deal with the club for Terry Butcher to move to Easter Road alongside assistant manager Maurice Malpas.

After an extensive recruitment process, on 4 December 2013, John Hughes was unveiled as the new manager of the club. Hughes left Caledonian Thistle on 20 May 2016, citing frustrations with his player budget and the club&#x27;s failure to retain players.

Long-term player Richie Foran was announced as the new Inverness manager on 30 May 2016, also announcing his player retirement. Foran was in charge of Caley Thistle for just under one-year before being sacked on 29 May 2017. During his time in charge, the club finished in last position in the Scottish Premiership, suffering relegation to the Scottish Championship on the final day of the season despite a 3–2 win over Motherwell. The club needed a win from Dundee over Hamilton Academical, to secure play-offs, which unfortunately did not come as Dundee succumbed to a 4–0 defeat.

A few weeks after the sacking of Foran, former manager John Robertson, who brought the club into the Premiership for the first time in their history in 2004, returned to manage the club in a bid to get them back to top flight. Doing this, he became the second former manager to return to managing the club, after Craig Brewster left in 2006 and came back for a second spell in 2007. Robertson&#x27;s attempt to return to the top flight immediately was halted by Dunfermline Athletic after a late goal stopped any chances of Inverness making the play-offs, and took the season, like the previous year, to the last day, where Dumbarton were playing Dunfermline Athletic, and Inverness were away to Greenock Morton. To secure a play-off spot, Dunfermline had to lose and Inverness had to win. Inverness did their part with a 3–0 win, but Dumbarton lost 4–0 after going down to 10 men against &quot;the Pars&quot;.

The following season did not start out successful, with 9 draws in their first 12 games, which also included failing to defend the Challenge Cup title after being defeated 2–1 by Dunfermline. However results soon picked up and by May, Inverness captured a play-off spot; they also enjoyed a strong cup run with a 6–1 win over Edinburgh City, a 4–0 win over East Kilbride, a 5–4 penalty win over Ross County and a 2–1 win over Dundee United before heading to Hampden where they were beaten 3–0 by Hearts in the semi-final. The play-offs started well, however after beating Ayr United 4–2 on aggregate hopes were shattered with a controversial 4–0 loss to Dundee United in the semi-final.

The 2019–20 season started off, again, with an early League Cup exit. Come March, the club were doing well in the Challenge Cup and league. However, the season was abruptly cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This meant that the season of every league from the Championship down was to be abandoned with the league tables being recognised as the final positions, however, the play-offs would not take place, resulting in Inverness being set for a 4th consecutive season in the Championship, and Dundee United, being promoted to the Premiership. This was officially confirmed on 9 May 2020, after the SPFL announced there would be no league reconstruction as there was not enough support from Premiership sides. Inverness finished their season on 10 March with a 3–1 home win over Queen of the South. On 10 May, a strongly worded statement was released by the club, which agreed with multiple other clubs statements of the SPFL bullying clubs during the Season Ending Vote, and that officials were turning a blind eye to all reported cases.

In early 2021, John Robertson left on compassionate leave due to a death in his family, and was subsequently replaced by interim manager Neil McCann, who took Inverness out of the relegation playoff zone into the top half and competing for promotion playoffs.

Ahead of the 2021–22 season, it was announced that Robertson would not be returning to a management role, instead dropping to a Director of Football role, nor would McCann take charge, turning down the opportunity, and it was announced that former Rangers and Scotland international Billy Dodds would take charge. In his first season, he took Inverness on a 7 game unbeaten run, and won Manager of the Month for September, before going on an 11 game winless run through Christmas and into the New Year. Despite this, Inverness managed to avoid dropping out of the playoff positions at any point during the season, and lost 6–2 on aggregate in the Premiership Playoff final against St Johnstone. The 2022–23 season started very much the same, with Inverness only losing twice in 10 league games between August and October, before going on an 8 game winless run over the festive period. Inverness ultimately finished 6th, but despite that, managed to go on a cup run that led them all the way to their second ever Scottish Cup final, which they lost 3–1 to Celtic.

During the 2023–24 season, Dodds was relieved of his duties after only claiming 1 point from the opening 6 fixtures which left Inverness rooted to the bottom of the table, before Everton legend Duncan Ferguson was announced as manager, briefly getting Inverness away from the relegation zone. However the club ended up embroiled in an unsuccessful relegation battle as they lost 5–3 to Hamilton Academical over two legs of the playoff final, dropping into the third tier for the first time since the 1998–99 season.

On October 22 2024 the club entered administration, leading to the departure of Duncan Ferguson, his assistant Gary Bollan and goalkeeping coach Stuart Garden the following day. Coach Scott Kellacher was appointed as manager.

== Mascots ==
In recent years, the club have embraced the trend of adopting an official mascot. These have included:

* &quot;ICaT&quot; – a play on the initials &#x27;ICT&#x27;, ICaT was designed from the winning drawing in a competition amongst Inverness school children.
* &quot;SuperSub&quot; – a Submarine sandwich in a Superhero costume was retired after Subway cancelled their sponsorship.
* &quot;Nessie&quot; – a &#x27;Nessie&#x27; costume wearing the club&#x27;s home kit. This creation has been rebranded as &quot;Lionel Nessi&quot;, in reference to international footballer Lionel Messi, and debuted at the 2018 Scottish Challenge Cup Final.

<text>Music Choice (abbreviated as MC) is an American television music service that digitally broadcasts audio-based music channels and video-related content to cable television providers in the United States. Music Choice reaches 65 million households in North America via linear television channels and TV-on-demand services.

Music Choice is distributed nationwide by Xfinity, Spectrum, Cox Communications, Verizon Fios, DirecTV and other smaller cable providers. Similar broadcast music services include DMX, Stingray Music (Canadian), Sirius XM, and XITE.

== History ==
Early development
Music Choice (formerly known as Digital Cable Radio) was the first digital audio broadcast service in the world and, under its founder and CEO David Del Beccaro, launched in test markets circa 1987. From its inception as an eight-channel audio service from Motorola&#x27;s cable group, Music Choice evolved into a multi-platform interactive music network based in New York that reaches millions of consumers across nationwide. Music Choice is a partnership owned by a consortium, including Universal&#x27;s Comcast, Charter Communications through its acquisition of Time Warner Cable in May 2016, Cox Communications, EMI Music, Microsoft, Arris International (formerly part of Motorola&#x27;s cable technologies division), and Sony Corporation of America.

Music Choice launched its first 24-hour interactive music video cable channel, SWRV, in February 2010.

Several of its stations are measured through Mediabase and its playlists are accounted for in weekly airplay charts in addition to traditional radio and Sirius XM plays.

== Platforms ==
=== Linear audio channels ===

Music Choice currently offers over 50 linear channels of various music radio formats through digital cable providers. The number of channels available varies by provider.

=== Music Choice On Demand ===
Music Choice offers free video on demand content, including hundreds of music videos from various recording artists, original programs, and artist features.

=== TV Everywhere App ===
Starting in July 2008, Music Choice released iOS and Android apps. The app requires login with a participating provider&#x27;s TV Everywhere authentication credentials to use, and the same access is available on traditional desktop/laptop web browsers.

=== On-screen information ===

Each Music Choice channel is distributed in freeze frame television, with still slides appearing on-screen as the music plays. These slides display banner advertising (the only advertising on the service, as the audio programming airs commercial-free) along with a looping carousel of “Did You Know?” factoids paired with file photos of the artists in question. In the past, the on-screen trivia factoids have been criticized by some as featuring facts that are overtly depressing or deal with death, as a May 2017 HuffPost story cited a number of factoids recalling various illnesses, homicides, and suicides of various musical artists and their close family, friends and partners over an evening of the network&#x27;s programming. The color coding on the channel can be blue, pink, green or yellow depending on the dayparts. In 2021, these Music Choice channels had a photo slideshow, that still changes the picture appearing on-screen as the music plays, and the music artist, song and album from top or bottom/up or down. Around October 18th of 2024, the design changed. Corners were rounded, and the fonts of elements on screen have been changed to Poppins, as opposed to it originally being Graphik Compact.

=== SWRV ===
In February 2010, Music Choice launched SWRV (pronounced &#x27;swerve&#x27;), a 24-hour interactive music video cable channel. The network struggled to gain momentum and was eventually rebranded to Music Choice Play on October 15, 2013, then wound down by the start of 2016.

===Subscription services===
As of Fall 2021, Music Choice offers several subscription services which are available through the extended Internet-connected services of cable set-top boxes.

====Music Choice Karaoke====
A domestic karaoke service providing access to instrumental versions of popular songs sorted into playlists with sing-along lyrics.

====Music Choice Relax====
A service providing calming instrumentals and soothing nature imagery for the purposes of relaxation.

====Music Choice+====
A service exclusive to Xfinity, and Cox Communications providing immediate access to any song and/or album in the Music Choice library, along with playlist creation, device downloads, and song skipping abilities.

== Legal issues ==
=== Stingray ===
In June 2016, Music Choice filed a lawsuit against Canada-based Stingray over patent infringement. The lawsuit occurred one month following the announcement that Comcast, half-owner of Music Choice, had chosen instead to offer Stingray Radio.

Music Choice drew criticism with the lawsuit; Stingray responded:

“Given the significant inroads that Stingray has made in the U.S. market [Comcast expansion] with its industry-changing technology, Stingray believes that Music Choice’s complaint is without merit and primarily motivated by competitive concerns rather than a desire to protect its intellectual property.”

Music Choice&#x27;s lawsuit against Stingray disputed a number of U.S. Patents pertaining to the on screen formatting of Stingray Digital&#x27;s music channels. On August 29, 2016, Stingray countersued Music Choice calling the patent lawsuit a &quot;&quot;smear campaign&quot;.&quot;

=== Music Modernization Act opposition ===

In 2018, A2IM CEO Richard James Burgess accused Music Choice of trying to solicit artist and label support to deceive Congress into reducing artists royalties paid by Music Choice. The criticism came as Music Choice publicly opposed the passage of the Music Modernization Act, which ultimately was signed into law on October 11, 2018.

=== SoundExchange ===

On April 10, 2019, SoundExchange filed a lawsuit against Music Choice for underpayment, following an audit of Music Choice&#x27;s royalty statements.

<text>A time server is a server computer that reads the actual time from a reference clock and distributes this information to its clients using a computer network. The time server may be a local network time server or an internet time server.

The most important and widely used protocol for distributing and synchronising time over the Internet is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), though other less-popular or outdated time protocols continue in use. A variety of protocols are in common use for sending time signals over radio links and serial connections.

The time reference used by a time server could be another time server on the network or the Internet, a connected radio clock or an atomic clock. The most common true time source is a GPS or GPS master clock. Time servers are sometimes multi-purpose network servers, dedicated network servers, or dedicated devices. All a dedicated time server does is provide accurate time.

An existing network server (e.g. a file server) can become a time server with additional software. The NTP homepage provides a free and widely used reference implementation of the NTP server and client for many popular operating systems. The other choice is a dedicated time server device.

The term &quot;stratum&quot; is used to label the closeness to a central or high quality time server. The stratum indicates the place of a particular time server in a hierarchy of servers. The scale is 1 to 15 where 1 is the most accurate and likely a highly specialized physical hardware device. Some time clients will reject a time update from a server whose stratum is too high, and most will prefer low strata time sources to higher ones. This can be a pitfall for administrators setting up an in-house time server with no true time source.

<doc id="743547" wikidata="Q7838231" url="?curid=743547" title="Trench code">
<text>Trench codes (a form of cryptography) were codes used for secrecy by field armies in World War I. Messages by field telephone, radio and carrier pigeons could be intercepted, hence the need for tactical World War I cryptography. Originally, the most commonly used codes were simple substitution codes, but due to the relative vulnerability of the classical cipher, trench codes came into existence. (Important messages generally used alternative encryption techniques for greater security.) The use of these codes required the distribution of codebooks to military personnel, which proved to be a security liability since these books could be stolen by enemy forces.

By the middle of World War I the conflict had settled down into a static battle of attrition, with the two sides sitting in huge lines of fixed earthwork fortifications. With armies generally immobile, distributing codebooks and protecting them was easier than it would have been for armies on the move. However, armies were still in danger of trench-raiding parties who would sneak into enemy lines and try to snatch codebooks. When this happened, an alarm could be raised and a code quickly changed. Trench codes were changed on a regular basis in an attempt to prevent code breakers from deciphering messages.

==French Army==
The French began to develop trench codes in early 1916. They started out as telephone codes, implemented at the request of a general whose forces had suffered devastating artillery bombardments due to indiscretions in telephone conversations between his men. The original telephone code featured a small set of two-letter codewords that were spelled out in voice communications. This grew into a three-letter code scheme, which was then adopted for wireless, with early one-part code implementations evolving into more secure two-part code implementations. The British began to adopt trench codes as well.

==German Army==
The Germans started using trench codes in the spring of 1917, evolving into a book of 4,000 codewords that were changed twice a month, with different codebooks used on different sectors of the front. The French codebreakers were extremely competent at cracking ciphers but were somewhat inexperienced at cracking codes, which require a slightly different mindset. It took them time to get to the point where they were able to crack the German codes in a timely fashion.

==U.S. troops==
The Americans were relative newcomers to cryptography when they entered the war, but they did have their star players. One was Parker Hitt, b. 1878, who before the war had been an Army Signal Corps instructor. He was one of the first to try to bring US Army cryptology into the 20th century, publishing an influential short work on the subject in 1915 called the &quot;Manual for the solution of military ciphers.&quot; He was assigned to France in an administrative role, but his advice was eagerly sought by colleagues working in operational cryptology. Another Signal Corps officer who would make his mark on cryptology was Joseph Mauborgne, who in 1914, as a first lieutenant, had been the first to publish a solution to the Playfair cipher.

When the Americans began moving up to the front in numbers in early 1918, they adopted trench codes and became very competent at their construction, with a Captain Howard R. Barnes eventually learning to produce them at a rate that surprised British colleagues. The Americans adopted a series of codes named after rivers, beginning with &quot;Potomac&quot;. They learned to print the codebooks on paper that burned easily and degraded quickly after a few weeks, when the codes would presumably be obsolete, while using a typeface that was easy to read under trench conditions.

==Communications discipline==
American code makers were often frustrated by the inability or refusal of combat units to use the codes—or worse, to use them properly. Lt. Col. Frank Moorman, reviewing U.S wireless intelligence in 1920. wrote:

That will be the real problem for the future, to make the men at the front realize the importance of handling codes carefully and observing &quot;foolish&quot; little details that the code man insists on. They cannot see the need of it and they do not want to do it. They will do anything they can to get out of it. My idea would be to hang a few of the offenders. This would not only get rid of some but would discourage the development of others. It would be a saving of lives to do it. It is a sacrifice of American lives to unnecessarily assist the enemy in the solution of our code.

<doc id="743552" wikidata="Q303001" url="?curid=743552" title="Janiculum">
<text>The Janiculum (; ), occasionally known as the Janiculan Hill, is a hill in western Rome, Italy. Although it is the second-tallest hill (the tallest being Monte Mario) in the contemporary city of Rome, the Janiculum does not figure among the proverbial Seven Hills of Rome, being west of the Tiber and outside the boundaries of the ancient city.

==Sights==
The Janiculum is one of the best locations in Rome for a scenic view of central Rome with its domes and bell towers. Other sights on the Janiculum include the church of San Pietro in Montorio, on what was formerly thought to be the site of St Peter&#x27;s crucifixion; a small shrine known as the Tempietto, designed by Donato Bramante, marks the supposed site of Peter&#x27;s death. The Janiculum also houses a Baroque fountain built by Pope Paul V in the late 17th century, the Fontana dell&#x27;Acqua Paola, and several foreign research institutions, including the American and Spanish Academies in Rome. The Hill is also the location of The American University of Rome, Pontifical Urban University, and Pontifical North American College, as well as the Orto Botanico dell&#x27;Università di Roma &quot;La Sapienza&quot; and the Palazzo Montorio, residence of the Ambassadors of Spain.

The Villa Lante al Gianicolo by Giulio Romano (1520–21) is an important early building by the Mannerist master, also with magnificent views.

==History==

===Ancient history and mythology===
The Janiculum was a center for the cult of the god Janus: its position overlooking the city made it a good place for augurs to observe the auspices.

In Roman mythology, &quot;Janiculum&quot; is the name of an ancient town founded by the god Janus (the two-faced god of beginnings). In Book VIII of the Aeneid by Virgil (Publius Vergilius Maro), King Evander shows Aeneas (the Trojan hero of this epic poem) the ruins of Saturnia and Janiculum on the Capitoline Hill near the Arcadian city of Pallanteum (the future site of Rome) (see line 54, Bk. 8). Virgil uses these ruins to stress the significance of the Capitoline Hill as the religious center of Rome.

According to Livy, the Janiculum was incorporated into ancient Rome during the time of king Ancus Marcius to prevent an enemy from occupying it. It was fortified by a wall, and a bridge was built across the Tiber to join it to the rest of the city.

During the war between Rome and Clusium in 508 BC, it is said that the forces of Lars Porsena occupied the Janiculum and laid siege to Rome.

===The water mills===
During the third century AD, a complex of water-mills was built here to grind grain to provide bread flour for the city. As revealed by excavations in the 1990s under the present American Academy in Rome, they sat astride the aqueduct Aqua Traiana and were in brick-faced concrete with a cocciopesto floor. In the limited excavated area, two mill races branched obliquely off the Aqua Traiana, turned to run parallel to the aqueduct for some distance, and then turned back to feed into the aqueduct again. It appeared that the northern mill race had 3 or 4 millwheels of 2.30 m diameter and width about 1.65 m to provide a sufficiently large working area, but only 2.6 m between their axle centres, which must have reduced efficiency due to turbulence between them. The southern race had one larger wheel.

The site resembles Barbegal, although the excavations show that they were undershot rather than overshot in design (i. e. with the stream entering at the bottom of the wheel, not the top). The mills were still in use in 537, when the Goths besieging the city cut off their water supply, the Aqua Traiana. They were later restored and may have remained in operation until at least the time of Pope Gregory IV (827–844).

The Aurelian Walls were continued up the hill by the emperor Aurelian (reigned AD 270–275) to include the water mills. 

The mills were already known from observations by R. Lanciani in the 1880s.

===19th century to present===
The Janiculum is the site of a battle in 1849 between the forces of Garibaldi, defending the revolutionary Roman Republic against French forces, who were fighting to restore the temporal power of the Pope over Rome. Several monuments to Garibaldi and to the fallen in the wars of Italian independence are on the Janiculum.

Daily at noon, a cannon fires once from the Janiculum in the direction of the Tiber as a time signal. This tradition goes back to December 1847, when the cannon of the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo gave the sign to the surrounding belltowers to start ringing at midday. In 1904, the ritual was transferred to the Janiculum and continued until 1939. On 21 April 1959, popular appeal convinced the Commune of Rome to resume the tradition after a twenty-year interruption.

The hill is featured in the third section of Ottorino Respighi&#x27;s tone poem &quot;Pines of Rome&quot;.

== Monuments ==

The crest of the Janiculum is dominated by the 1895 equestrian Monument to Garibaldi, designed by Italian sculptor Emilio Gallori. This site was chosen for its proximity to the Villa Doria Pamphili, where Garibaldi mounted a military defense of the short-lived Roman Republic in late April 1849.

The hill also features a number of statues and monuments of prominent Italians. A 2011 guide published by the local Associazione Amilcare Cipriani group, after an extensive restoration of these monuments, lists a total of 84 busts on the hill.

<text>Flight 11P of SpaceShipOne was its eighth independent flight, its first powered flight, and the first privately funded crewed flight to reach supersonic speeds. It occurred on December 17, 2003.

The date of the test flight was 100 years to the day (and almost to the hour) since the Wright Brothers made the first powered flight. It followed several months of glide tests. The pilot was Brian Binnie.

==Details==
White Knight, piloted by Peter Siebold, carried SpaceShipOne to launch altitude. At 08:15 PDT at an altitude of 47,900 feet (14.6 km) and a speed of 112 knots (58 m/s), SpaceShipOne was released from White Knight. After gliding to 44,400 feet (13.5 km) and accelerating to Mach 0.55, the rocket was lit for a 15 second burn.

Nine seconds into the burn, SpaceShipOne exceeded the speed of sound. The craft climbed at a 70-degree angle, accelerating at 3 &quot;g&quot; (30 m/s²). At burn-out the Mach number was 1.2. The craft coasted to an apogee altitude of 67,800 feet (20.7 km).

The craft was reconfigured into high-drag (&quot;feathered&quot;) mode to begin descent. After about a minute of descent, it switched to glider configuration at 35,000 feet (10.7 km). It then glided for 12 minutes back to Mojave Airport.

During landing a roll oscillation caused the left main gear to collapse. The craft made a runway excursion rolling to a stop in soft sand. The craft sustained minor damage, later repaired, and the pilot was uninjured.

<text>International Daily News (), also known as Guoji Ribao, is a major Chinese-language newspaper in North America and Indonesia. It is a pro-mainland newspaper, sold in several major Chinatowns.

The newspaper was founded and owned by Lee Ya-ping (李亚频) and Chen Tao (陈韬) in 1981 in the city of Monterey Park, California. On October 1, 1995, Ted Sioeng, an Indonesian-born entrepreneur, and his family bought the &quot;International Daily News&quot;, paying between $3 and $4 million for the paper. This purchase was consummated on July 1, 1996.

In contrast to its competitor, the &quot;World Journal&quot;, the &quot;International Daily News&quot; appeals to mainland Chinese immigrants in North America due to its much less hostile attitude toward mainland China/Chinese (although in the mid/late-1990s, the &quot;World Journal&quot; significantly moderated its anti-China line).

Lee Ya-ping, a Chinese American businesswoman and the owner and publisher of &quot;International Daily News&quot;, was jailed by the Taiwanese government under the Kuomintang regime on 17 September 1985 during a visit to Taiwan, charged with spreading propaganda for the Chinese Communist Party, because she was suspected of publishing articles supporting Beijing&#x27;s overtures for reunification of Taiwan with mainland China. Eventually, Lee was released nine days later, under pressure from the United States Congress.

On September 2, 2001, &quot;International Daily News&quot; and &quot;Java Post&quot; collaborated to bundle and publish the &quot;Wen Wei Po (Southeast Asia Edition)&quot;, an 8-page daily edition, which was launched simultaneously in Jakarta, Surabaya, Pontianak, and Medan.

<text>Milbury Heath is a hamlet in South Gloucestershire, England, located east of Thornbury. The hamlet has a garden centre and a few other farm shops. The heath is a local high point (109 m above sea level at ) and offers views west across the Severn Vale, and north into the Vale of Berkeley. A seat at the viewpoint commemorates the centenary of Falfield Parish Council in 1994. The hamlet has a former (Methodist?) chapel now converted to a private house, and a duck-pond.

The hamlet is on the Avon Cycleway. Both the A38 road and M5 motorway pass nearby. Just to the north on the A38, (technically in Buckover), is the White Horse pub.

==Robin killing controversy==
The garden centre at Milbury Heath has come under fire due to the treatment of robins who were nesting there and were sometimes flying in the cafeteria section. They were killed after getting permission from DEFRA. This sparked controversy among many groups, including the RSPCA. The garden centre defended the killings by claiming they were &quot;a pest&quot; and a &quot;health hazard&quot;.

<text>Bill Drake (January 14, 1937 – November 29, 2008), born Philip Yarbrough, was an American radio programmer who co-developed the Boss Radio format with Gene Chenault via their company Drake-Chenault.

==Early career==
Phil Yarbrough began his broadcast career in 1953, working part-time at WMGR in Bainbridge, Georgia (near his hometown of Donalsonville, Georgia). Following high school graduation, he attended Georgia Teachers College (Georgia Southern University today) in Statesboro, Georgia, on a basketball scholarship. His major was P.E., with the intention of teaching and coaching after graduation. While attending college, Yarbrough worked the evening shift at WWNS in Statesboro. After a knee injury in 1956, he lost his scholarship and left college for good. With no other good alternative, he continued to work at WWNS for the next few years. Briefly moving back to his hometown with wife Roberta, Yarbrough returned to WMGR for a short time. Wisely searching for career advancement, he gained employment with Bartell Broadcasting, at their newly acquired Atlanta station, post-purchase christened WAKE (a pairing with their Birmingham station, WYDE...&quot;the wide awake stations&quot;). Management proposed changing his name to Bill Blake (rhyming with &#x27;wake&#x27;). Yarbrough protested. He proposed Phil Drake (his mother&#x27;s maiden name). They settled on Bill Drake, and the rest is history.

==Drake-Chenault==

Later, at KYNO in Fresno, California, he met Gene Chenault, who became his business partner. Together, the pair developed influential radio programming strategies and tactics, as well as working with future &quot;Boss Jocks&quot; (their name for on-air radio talent).

Drake-Chenault streamlined the Top 40 radio format originally created by Todd Storz, Gordon McLendon and other radio programmers in the early 1950s. The format took a set list of popular songs and repeated them all day long. Jingles, news updates, traffic, and other features were designed to make Top 40 radio appeal to car listeners. By early 1964, the era of the British Invasion, Top 40 radio had become the dominant radio format for North American listeners and swept much of the Western world.

Drake applied modern methods such as market research and ratings demographics to the format to increase the number of listeners. He advocated limiting the amount of disc jockey chatter, the number of advertisements and playing only the top hits. Drake&#x27;s concepts included 20/20 News and counter-programming with music sweeps. Drake-Chenault controlled aspects including the DJs that were hired to radio contests, visual logos, promotions, and commercial policy. He hired the Johnny Mann Singers to produce the Boss Radio jingles, which were bright, high-energy transitions from song to song.

Drake used these methods at Fresno&#x27;s KYNO and then KGB, which moved from 14th to 1st in San Diego. In the spring of 1965, Drake-Chenault were hired by the then-financially-struggling KHJ in Los Angeles, after KGB&#x27;s owner, Willett Brown, suggested to his fellow RKO board members that Drake could improve the station&#x27;s performance. Drake hired Ron Jacobs as program director, Robert W. Morgan in the mornings and The Real Don Steele in the afternoons. Though &quot;Boss Radio&quot; was criticized, KHJ quickly jumped from near obscurity to the number one radio station in Los Angeles. Drake also programmed KFRC in San Francisco, WOR-FM in New York, KAKC in Tulsa, WHBQ in Memphis, WUBE (AM) in Cincinnati, WRKO in Boston and 50,000 watt CKLW, in Windsor, Ontario.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Drake and Chenault formed Drake-Chenault Inc., marketing the format via similar customized Johnny Mann jingle packages used on KHJ. These jingle packages were sold across the US and overseas. They also marketed &quot;automated&quot; radio format packages such as &quot;Hit Parade&quot;, &quot;Solid Gold&quot;, &quot;Classic Gold&quot; and &quot;Great American Country&quot;. Disc Jockey voices heard on those formats included Robert W. Morgan, Charlie Van Dyke and others. Additionally, they marketed documentaries like &quot;The History of Rock and Roll&quot;, a 10-episode, 52-hours-long series on which Drake worked as a writer and narrator.

==After Drake-Chenault==

Drake-Chenault was sold and eventually dissolved in the mid-1980s. In 1973, Drake left KHJ, along with Steele and Morgan, to program KIQQ-FM (&quot;K-100&quot;) in Los Angeles. Bill Drake was a member of the nominating committee of the Hit Parade Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Georgia Radio Hall of Fame in 2007.

He died of lung cancer in Los Angeles on November 29, 2008.
Gene Chenault died at 90 on February 23, 2010.

<text>A garden centre (Commonwealth English spelling; U.S. nursery or garden center) is a retail operation that sells plants and related products for the domestic garden as its primary business.

It is a development from the concept of the retail plant nursery but with a wider range of outdoor products and on-site facilities. 

It is now usual for garden centres to obtain their stock from plants which have been propagated elsewhere, such as by specialist nurseries or wholesalers. Garden centres also have a range of varieties, from homeware products, gifts and cafes.

== United Kingdom ==
The UK has a large and diverse garden centre industry. There are over 1,500 garden centres in the UK, ranging from small, independent businesses to large, national chains. The industry is worth an estimated £4.6 billion per year.

The most popular products sold at garden centres include plants, compost, fertilizers, tools, and landscaping materials. Many garden centres also sell pet-related products, home and interior products, and food and drink.

Garden centres are an important part of the UK economy. They provide jobs for over 100,000 people and generate billions of pounds in revenue each year. They also play a role in promoting gardening and outdoor living in the UK.

=== History of Garden Centres in the UK ===
The first garden centre in the UK was opened in 1860. It was called the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Garden Shop, and it was located in London. The shop sold plants, seeds, and gardening supplies.

In the early 20th century, garden centres began to become more popular. This was due to a number of factors, including the rise of the middle class, the increasing popularity of gardening, and the development of new technologies that made it easier to grow plants.

In the 1970s, garden centres began to grow in size and number. This was due to a number of factors, including the increasing popularity of gardening, the development of new shopping centers, and the rise of national chains.

Today, garden centres are a popular destination for people who are interested in gardening, landscaping, and outdoor living. They offer a wide range of products and services, and they play an important role in the UK economy.

=== Largest Garden Centres in the UK ===

The largest garden centre in the UK is Bridgemere Garden Centre (Blue Diamond Garden Centres), which is located in Nantwich, Cheshire. It covers an area of 50 acres and has over 1 million visitors each year.

The largest UK garden centre chains include:
Home improvement retailer B&amp;Q, as well as variety retailers B&amp;M, Home Bargains and The Range have their own garden departments, alongside the main store buildings.

=== Evolution of Garden Centres in the UK ===
Garden centres have evolved significantly over the years in the UK. The first garden centre in the UK was opened in 1860, and it was a small, independent business. However, in the 1970s, garden centres began to grow in size and number. This was due to a number of factors, including the increasing popularity of gardening, the development of new shopping centers, and the rise of national chains.

In the early days, garden centres were primarily focused on selling plants and gardening supplies. However, over time, they began to offer a wider range of products and services. Today, many garden centres also sell pet supplies, home and garden products, food and drink, and even clothing.

In addition to their product range, garden centres have also evolved in terms of their customer experience. In the past, garden centres were often seen as a place to buy plants and gardening supplies. However, today, they are more of a leisure destination. Many garden centres have cafes, restaurants, play areas, and other amenities that make them a popular destination for families and couples.

The evolution of garden centres in the UK has been driven by a number of factors. The increasing popularity of gardening has been one of the most important factors. The UK is a nation of gardeners, and there is a strong demand for garden centres. Additionally, the development of new shopping centers has provided garden centres with new opportunities to grow.

The rise of national chains has also been a major factor in the evolution of garden centres in the UK. National chains have been able to achieve economies of scale, which has allowed them to offer lower prices and a wider range of products. This has put pressure on independent garden centres, and many of them have been forced to close.

Despite the challenges facing independent garden centres, there is still a strong demand for them. Many people prefer to shop at independent garden centres because they offer a more personal touch. Additionally, independent garden centres often have a wider range of products and services than national chains.

== United States ==
The United States retail garden-center market contained roughly 16,000 independently operated companies in 2010 according to Research and Markets. The combined annual revenue for the lot of them is about $46.2 billion. Most garden centers are independently owned. There are some regional chains, but there is no national US garden center chain, unlike in the UK where there are several. However, both of the largest home improvement stores in the US—Lowe&#x27;s and The Home Depot—refer to their gardening departments as garden centers and larger hardware stores have &quot;Lawn and Garden&quot; departments.

Some of the items that can be found in US garden centers, often called nurseries, include annual and perennial flowers, trees and shrubs, roses, container gardens, hanging baskets, houseplants, water gardening, seeds and bulbs, potting mixes, soil amendments and mulch, fertilizers and chemicals, pottery, garden tools and supplies, fountains and garden decor, much like their UK counterparts.

Many US garden centers have other departments including wild bird feeding, floral, gift, outdoor furniture and barbecue grills, home decor, landscape design, landscaping services and pet supplies. Most garden centers have a large Christmas department during the holiday season. Some garden centres have added a cafe or coffee bar, but not like the restaurants found in some European garden centres.

Greenhouses are commonly part of a US garden center. Greenhouses protect the plants from late cold snaps, allow stores to keep houseplants in prime condition, and keep the customers dry on rainy days.

Garden centers employ horticulturists who can diagnose problems and make recommendations to gardeners. This is almost always provided as a free service in the store and some of the bigger garden centers have classes that are open to the public.

Many garden centers belong to a buying cooperative. The largest is Master Nursery Garden Centers with just under 800 members followed by Home and Garden Showplace (part of the larger cooperative the True Value Company) with 260 members, Northwest Nursery Buyers Association with 46 members and finally, ECGC with 14 very large garden center members.

The trade associations of independent garden centers in the US is the Garden Centers of America and the American Nursery &amp; Landscape Association.

=== Garden Centres in Europe ===
Garden centres across Europe play a significant role in supporting the region’s horticultural interests, catering to both amateur gardeners and professional landscapers. These centres typically offer a diverse range of plants, gardening tools, outdoor furniture, and decorative items, as well as expert advice and workshops. With a unique blend of local traditions and modern retail practices, garden centres vary widely across the continent, reflecting the environmental and cultural diversity of the region.

==== Regional Highlights ====

===== Western Europe =====
In France, garden centres, often referred to as &quot;jardineries&quot;, are commonly integrated with large agricultural cooperatives. Companies like Truffaut and Jardiland dominate the market, offering extensive selections of plants, garden supplies, and home decor. French garden centres are also known for their focus on organic products and biodiversity, reflecting the country&#x27;s emphasis on sustainability.

Belgium and the Netherlands boast some of the most innovative garden centres in Europe, given their strong horticultural traditions. The Netherlands, in particular, is home to cutting-edge centres that incorporate advanced greenhouse technology and hydroponics, alongside vast selections of ornamental plants, bulbs, and seeds. Popular names like Intratuin and GroenRijk set industry standards with large, eco-friendly retail spaces.

===== Southern Europe =====
In Italy and Spain, garden centres often showcase plants and materials suited to Mediterranean climates, such as olive trees, citrus plants, and drought-tolerant flora. Italian garden centres, like Viridea, often combine traditional plant sales with boutique experiences, featuring cafes and cooking classes using home-grown herbs. Meanwhile, Spanish centres, such as Verdecora, emphasize outdoor living trends, including terracotta pottery and furnishings suited to warm climates.

In Portugal, garden centres are smaller in scale but serve as key suppliers of native plants like cork oak and succulents. They often cater to both locals and tourists looking to create sustainable gardens in coastal and arid regions.

===== Northern Europe =====
Garden centres in Germany and Scandinavia focus heavily on functionality and sustainability. German retailers such as Dehner lead the industry, offering everything from garden equipment to landscaping services, often in collaboration with environmental organisations. Scandinavian garden centres, reflecting their climate, specialise in cold-hardy plants, indoor gardening solutions, and minimalist outdoor decor.

===== Central and Eastern Europe =====
In Poland, Hungary, and other parts of Central Europe, garden centres are increasingly modernising, with companies like Ogrodnik and OBI expanding their operations. These centres often highlight regional plants and seasonal flowers, catering to the area&#x27;s strong gardening culture. In Russia, large-scale centres near metropolitan areas focus on ornamental gardening, offering exotic plants alongside traditional varieties.

In the Balkans, smaller garden centres typically act as community hubs, offering locally-grown plants and tailored advice. However, countries like Croatia and Serbia are seeing a rise in larger chains as urban populations grow interested in gardening as a leisure activity.

==== Key Trends in European Garden Centres ====

# Sustainability and Biodiversity: Many European garden centres emphasise eco-friendly products, native plant species, and biodiversity, in line with European Union policies promoting green practices.
# Urban Gardening: As urban populations increase, centres have begun catering to city dwellers with solutions for balcony and rooftop gardens.
# Experiential Retail: A shift toward providing experiences—such as workshops, cafes, and community events—has helped garden centres attract a broader customer base.
# Digitalisation: Online platforms and e-commerce have become integral to the success of garden centres, especially in densely populated regions like Germany and France.

==== Challenges ====
European garden centres face challenges including climate change, rising costs of imported plants, and competition from DIY stores and online retailers. Nonetheless, the sector continues to innovate, balancing tradition with modern retail strategies.

<doc id="743577" wikidata="Q483856" url="?curid=743577" title="Turkey national football team">
<text>The Turkey national football team (), recognized as Türkiye by FIFA and UEFA, represents Turkey in men&#x27;s international football matches. The team is controlled by the Turkish Football Federation (), the governing body for football in Turkey, which was founded in 1923 and has been a member of FIFA since 1923 and UEFA since 1962.

The team played their first official international game in 1923 and has represented the nation in major competitions since their debut appearance at the 1924 Summer Olympics. They have participated in the Summer Olympics a total of six times (1924, 1928, 1936, 1948, 1952, and 1960), and reached the quarter-finals twice, in 1948 and 1952.

The team enjoyed their highest achievements in the 2000s, most notably finishing in third place at the 2002 FIFA World Cup and the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup, and reaching the semi-finals at UEFA Euro 2008. They qualified for the FIFA World Cup three times (1950, 1954, and 2002) and reached the semi-finals in 2002, winning the bronze medal. The team qualified for the UEFA European Championship six times. Making their debut at Euro 1996, they reached the quarter-finals in Euro 2000 and semi-finals in Euro 2008. In recent years, Türkiye qualified to the Euro 2016, Euro 2020, and Euro 2024 championships, reaching the quarter-finals of the latter. Türkiye was named as a co-host for UEFA Euro 2032, and will qualify automatically.

==History==
===Early years===
The Turkish national team&#x27;s first game was against Romania, played on 26 October 1923 at Taksim Stadium in Istanbul, a 2–2 draw. Zeki Rıza Sporel is considered as the first big star of Turkish football as he scored the first two goals against Romania. Turkey played their first ever official match at the 1924 Summer Olympics losing to Czechoslovakia, 5–2. The first two goals in an official game were scored by Bekir Refet.
Although Turkey qualified for the 1950 World Cup, beating Syria 7–0, they were forced to withdraw from the tournament due to financial problems. Turkey then qualified for the 1954 World Cup after a play-off with Spain. They first lost 4–1 to Spain, but a 1–0 win a few days later initiated a replay (there was no clause for aggregate results in the rules at the time, which would have qualified Spain). On that occasion, they tied 2–2 after, booking their place after a coin toss. Turkey was grouped along with Hungary and West Germany. The Turks, however, never played Hungary due to the tournament format, and a 4–1 defeat by the Germans was followed by Turkey carrying out a 7–0 win over South Korea. Turkey lost the play-off to West Germany 7–2. In 1956, however, Turkey did play Hungary in a friendly match in Istanbul, defeating what was one of the strongest teams of the era, 3–1. Lefter Küçükandonyadis, arguably one of the best Turkish strikers of all time, scored two goals during the tournament.

===Near misses===

Despite the introduction of a national league, and showings by Turkish clubs in European competition, the 1960s would be a barren time for the national team. Most players from the 1954 World Cup squad had already retired, and the new generation of players failed to qualify for a major tournament. The 1970s saw Turkey holding back in the World Cup and UEFA European Championship qualifiers, but the team was a point too short to qualify for both UEFA Euro 1972 and Euro 1976. In the 1980s the Turks also suffered their worst defeats with 8–0 scorelines against Poland and twice against England. But the 1990 World Cup qualifiers would mark a turning point for Turkish football, with Turkey only missing out on qualification in the final match. Prominent players in this period included Rıdvan Dilmen, Oğuz Çetin, Rıza Çalımbay, Feyyaz Uçar, and European Golden Boot winner Tanju Çolak.

===1990s===
In 1990, coach Sepp Piontek was put in charge of the national team. Under his guidance, a group of new players debuted for the national team. Many of these players (which included Bülent Korkmaz, Alpay Özalan, Sergen Yalçın, Rüştü Reçber, and Hakan Şükür) would become the backbone of the national team for many years. Piontek&#x27;s mission came to an end in 1993, when he was replaced by Fatih Terim, who in turn managed to qualify for Euro 1996. Turkey qualified for its first major tournament since 1954. The appointment of Piontek was a recommended move by another coach, Jupp Derwall, who had coached Galatasaray for three seasons.
Turkey qualified for Euro 1996, defeating both Switzerland and Sweden 2–1 during qualification. Despite a solid performance during the qualifiers, Turkey lost all their matches without scoring a single goal. They did, however, go home with an award: the fair play award, given to Özalan.

===2000s===
Although Turkey failed to qualify for the 1998 World Cup, they qualified for Euro 2000 after winning a play-off against the Republic of Ireland. Turkey lost their first match 2–1 to Italy, then drew their second match against Sweden 0–0, and beat host nation Belgium 2–0, making it the first time in the history of the UEFA European Championship a host nation had been eliminated in the first round. This victory brought Turkey into the quarter-finals of the tournament, where they were beaten 2–0 by Portugal, with Arif Erdem missing a penalty.
For the 2002 World Cup, Turkey finished second in their qualifying group, losing to Sweden in the match that would decide the number-one spot. The Turks were forced to play the play-offs against Austria. They defeated the Austrians 6–0 on aggregate and booked their place in the finals. The Turkish team started the 2002 World Cup with a 2–1 defeat against eventual winners Brazil. Turkey qualified from the group stage with a 3–0 win against China PR after drawing 1–1 with Costa Rica. Turkey then faced co-hosts Japan in the second round, winning 1–0. The Turkish team continued their run, as they beat Senegal 1–0 on a golden goal to book their place in the semi-finals, where a 1–0 defeat against eventual tournament winners Brazil forced them to play the third-place match. The Turks won the bronze medal after a 3–2 victory over co-hosts South Korea. Hakan Şükür scored Turkey&#x27;s first goal in 10.8 seconds, despite the South Koreans kicking off first. It was the fastest goal in World Cup history.
Tens of thousands of flag-waving Turkish fans greeted the World Cup squad on their return to Istanbul, where they joined a massive street party at Taksim Square. Rüştü Reçber, Alpay Özalan and Hasan Şaş were all included in the All-Star Team, with Reçber also being voted as the best goalkeeper in the UEFA Team of the Year 2002, while Şenol Güneş was being voted as the best manager.

In 2003, Turkey finished third at the FIFA Confederations Cup. In the group stage, Turkey defeated the United States 2–1 before losing to Cameroon 1–0. In their final group match, Turkey drew 2–2 against Brazil, eliminating them from the tournament. Turkey lost to eventual tournament winners France 3–2 in the semi-finals, and then defeated Colombia 2–1 in the third-place match. Tuncay scored three goals and an assist, which won him the Silver Shoe Award and the Silver Ball Award for the second-best player of the tournament.

The Turks failed to qualify for Euro 2004 after Latvia won the qualification play-offs. They also missed out on the 2006 World Cup after failing to win the play-offs, this time on away goals against Switzerland, again after finishing second in their group.

Turkey qualified for their first international tournament in six years by finishing second behind Greece in Euro 2008 qualifying Group C to reach the tournament. They were placed alongside Switzerland, Portugal, and the Czech Republic in Group A. In their first match, they played Portugal and were beaten 2–0, but wins over Switzerland (2–1) and the Czech Republic (3–2) – both secured by late goals – meant qualification for the knockout stages. Turkey knocked out a host nation – Switzerland – in the group stages for the second time. The quarter-final against Croatia was goalless after 90 minutes, and Croatia led 1–0 in the final minute of extra time, but another late Turkish goal by forward Semih Şentürk brought the game to penalties. The goal raised some controversy with Croatia fans and Croatia head coach Slaven Bilić, who claimed that the goal had been scored after extra time had elapsed. This complaint, however, was overruled, and the game went into penalties. Turkey defeated Croatia in penalties, 3–1. Turkey went into the semi-final against Germany with just 14 outfield players available as a result of injuries and suspensions but scored first and were drawing 2–2. But they finished third by default after losing 3–2 with a last-minute goal by Philipp Lahm.

===2010s===
Turkey was drawn in UEFA Group 5 together with Armenia, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Estonia and Spain. Turkey had a mixed qualifying campaign, finishing with 15 points and missing out on a play-off place to Bosnia and Herzegovina with 19 points. Spain topped the group to qualify, winning every game in the process. Coach Fatih Terim announced he would be resigning his post following their failure to qualify.
Turkey was drawn in Group A in qualification for Euro 2012, together with Kazakhstan, Austria, Belgium, Germany and Azerbaijan. The Turks reached the play-offs after beating Azerbaijan 1–0 but were eliminated 3–0 on aggregate by Croatia.

On 14 November 2012, Turkey celebrated their 500th match in a friendly game played against Denmark at the Türk Telekom Arena, Istanbul, which ended in a 1–1 draw. Before the match, footballers and coaches, who contributed to the national team&#x27;s success in the past, were honored. Turkish pop singer Hadise, who wore a national team jersey with the number 500, performed a small concert.

Turkey was drawn in Group D in qualification for the 2014 World Cup, together with Andorra, Estonia, Hungary, the Netherlands and Romania, finishing fourth. Abdullah Avcı was sacked soon after. Fatih Terim was put in charge for the third time to lead the national team, but a 2–0 defeat against the Netherlands ended hopes of qualification.
Grouped in Group A in the qualification campaign for Euro 2016, with Iceland, Latvia, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, and the Czech Republic, the team qualified for their first major tournament in eight years as the best third-placed team after beating Iceland 1–0, with Selçuk İnan netting a free kick in the 89th minute, along with Kazakhstan beating Latvia 1–0. After a year and a half of going unbeaten, a loss to England as a pre-tournament friendly ended the team&#x27;s winning streak, subsequently leading to back-to-back losses against Croatia and Spain in the tournament. Turkey won their last game against the Czech Republic, 2–0. They nearly reached the last 16 until a late winner for Ireland against Italy meant that the latter instead qualified as one of the best third-placed teams.

Placed with Croatia, Finland, Iceland, Kosovo and Ukraine for 2018 World Cup qualifying, manager Fatih Terim left after an off-field incident, and 72-year-old former Romania manager Mircea Lucescu took over. After eight games, Turkey were in pole position to qualify for the tournament, but a 3–0 defeat to Iceland at home ended automatic qualification hopes. After a 2–2 draw against Finland, the team finished fourth in Group I.

Turkey was drawn with Russia and Sweden in the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League B and performed poorly, leading to a bottom finish. In the first game at home against 2018 World Cup host and quarter-finalist Russia, Turkey lost 2–1. Turkey then put up its best performance in the League, winning 3–2 against Sweden on Swedish soil. However, Turkey could not extend their performances and lost to Russia in Sochi before suffering a humiliating 1–0 home loss to Sweden, thus initially relegating Turkey to League C. However, UEFA rule changes meant Turkey was allowed to remain in League B.

Turkey was drawn in Group H in the qualifying stages of Euro 2020 along with 2018 World Cup champions France, Iceland, Albania, Moldova, and Andorra. Veteran coach Şenol Güneş revolutionized the team, with many young talents, combining them with experienced players like Burak Yılmaz and Emre Belözoglu. The team eventually managed to achieve a 2–0 victory against France in Konya and a 1–1 draw at the Stade de France. Turkey then struggled against Andorra in their first match, winning after an 89th-minute goal at Vodafone Park in Istanbul. Turkey&#x27;s only defeat in the group came against Iceland in Reykjavík, losing 2–1. The defeat came after the ill-treatment of the Turkish group at the Iceland customs, keeping them at the airport for three hours. This was followed by an Icelandic supporter holding a toilet brush to team captain Emre Belozoglu as a pretend microphone during an interview. The events were heavily criticized by the Turkish and European media. Turkey entered matchday nine as group leaders with 19 points. They and Iceland drew 0–0 at Turk Telekom Arena in Istanbul. After finishing behind France, a draw was enough to secure Turkey a spot in Euro 2020 finals, ahead of their away match against Andorra.

===2020s===
After qualifying for Euro 2020, which would be postponed to June and July 2021 due to COVID-19, Turkey was drawn against Russia, alongside Hungary, and Serbia in the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League B. They performed poorly in their two opening games in September 2020. The first game against Hungary at home saw Turkey suffer a 1–0 defeat courtesy of a free kick from Dominik Szoboszlai. Playing in Belgrade, following Aleksandar Kolarov&#x27;s red card, the Turks were held goalless against Serbia. This hampered their chances of qualifying for League A, as their next opponents in October would be Russia (a country that Turkey hasn&#x27;t beaten since 1975) and Hungary.

In Moscow, Turkey drew 1–1 after Kenan Karaman&#x27;s equalizer. The Turkish side then drew 2–2 against Serbia at home.

Against Russia, Denis Cheryshev scored for the Russians to take an early lead making the Turkish side look hapless. But after Russia&#x27;s red card reduced the side to ten men, the Turks eventually won 3–2. The Turks then traveled to Hungary with the hope that a win against the Hungarians could mean possible promotion, if Russia lost to Serbia. While Russia suffered a humiliating 5–0 defeat away in Belgrade, Turkey also lost 2–0 to the Hungarians. That meant Turkey and Serbia were tied on points, but they were relegated after they lost the head-to-head away goals tiebreaker, 2–0. Such an outcome also meant Turkey would have to fight to get a direct Qatar 2022 ticket as play-off qualification appeared slim with their relegation, in which the 2022 World Cup qualifiers that started in March 2021.

Turkey had the honor of opening the Euro 2021 finals, but with Ciro Immobile and Lorenzo Insigne scoring, Turkey fell 3–0 to Italy. Roberto Mancini&#x27;s side had been frustrated by Turkey&#x27;s defensive approach in the first half but broke through in the 53rd minute when a hard-hit cross from Domenico Berardi flew in off Turkish defender Merih Demiral for an own goal. They went on to lose the next two games to both Switzerland and Wales, losing all three games alongside debutants North Macedonia.

In the 2022 World Cup qualifiers, Turkey was drawn into Group G with the Netherlands, Norway, Montenegro, Latvia, and Gibraltar. After they finished second in their group behind the Netherlands, they entered 2022 FIFA World Cup UEFA playoffs against Portugal but they lost 3–1 in a game that Burak Yılmaz missed a crucial penalty to equalise and thus failed to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Afterwards, he announced his international retirement.

In 2022–23 UEFA Nations League C, they were drawn in Group 1 with Luxembourg, the Faroe Islanders, Lithuania. They were promoted to League B after recording 13 points in six games. Their Nations League success not only rewarded them a playoff place should they fail to qualify directly, but also an easier draw in Group D with Croatia, Wales, Armenia, and Latvia. They subsequently qualified directly on 16 October 2023 and finished first on 19 November 2023.

Turkey took part in Euro 2024 Group F together with Portugal, Czech Republic and play-off winner Georgia and finished the group in 2nd place. The team reached the quarter-finals by beating Austria 2–1, then lost to the Netherlands 2–1 and finished the tournament in 5th place.

===2030s===
Turkey is set to take part of the UEFA Euro 2032 having automatically qualified as co-host along with Italy who also automatically qualified as co-host.

==Kit suppliers==

Turkey&#x27;s kit colors were home red kits and white away kits, manufactured by Adidas, from 1982 to 2002. Nike became the manufacturer in 2003. 17 years later, they switched their kit colors to white for home kits and red as the away color.
== Rivalries ==

Turkey has developed several notable rivalries, the most well-known being Croatia, and Greece, with a smaller rivalry against Armenia.

Turkey and Croatia have played each other nine times, with their first encounter at Euro 1996; where both countries made their debuts in the opening match, which Croatia won 1–0. In Euro 2008, Turkey won on penalties after a 1–1 deadlock. The two teams faced each other in the 2012 Euro qualifying play-offs, with Croatia winning 3–0 in the first-leg in Istanbul, and advancing to the tournament finals following a 0–0 draw in the second-leg. The two teams faced each other once again in a European competition at Euro 2016, playing in the opening match of Group D, with Croatia winning 1–0. Only three months after the Euros, the two teams played in their opening match in Group I of 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying, which finished 1–1. Exactly one year later, Turkey won the reverse fixture 1–0 at home, which played a key part in both countries&#x27; qualifying campaigns, although Turkey would not qualify for the World Cup while Croatia would finish runners-up behind France. Turkey and Croatia would again face each other during the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying campaign, where Turkey managed to shock Croatia with a 1–0 win away as the Turks managed to top the table of a qualification group for the first time in their history, whereas Croatia, despite a 2–0 away win earlier to Turkey, had struggled with a rather poor performance and only managed to qualify at the last hurdle.

Turkey also has a historical rivalry with Greece. Playing 13 times, Turkey won eight matches, drew thrice, and lost only three games. Both countries have been described as &quot;punching above their weight&quot;, with Greece winning Euro 2004 after being classified as underdogs before the competition, and Turkey advancing to the semi-finals of Euro 2008, where they were knocked out by Germany. Due to tension between the two countries and the dispute over Cyprus, coupled with several incidents occurring during matches between Turkish and Greek clubs, it has been described as one of the biggest international football rivalries.

<text>Pieter van Abeele (1608 - February 21, 1684 (buried)) was a Dutch medallist and coiner in Amsterdam.

Van Abeele was born in Middelburg. He perfected the technique of pressing hollow medals. He created the two sides of the medal separately and combined them with a ring of metal. His works are said to be the best of their time, and consist mostly of memorial and portrait medals. They depict several members of the House of Orange, Admiral Maarten Tromp, Jan Wolfert van Brederode, Charles X of Sweden and Charles II of England. He also made commemorative medals for the destruction of the English fleet and the peace of 1667, as well as one showing the granting of the coat of arms to the city of Amsterdam by Count William II of Holland and Emperor Maximilian I. He died in Amsterdam.

<text>Vsevolod Emilyevich Meyerhold (; born ; 2 February 1940) was a Russian and Soviet theatre director, actor and theatrical producer. His provocative experiments dealing with physical being and symbolism in an unconventional theatre setting made him one of the seminal forces in modern international theatre.

During the Great Purge, Meyerhold was arrested in June 1939. He was tortured, his wife was murdered, and he was executed on 2 February 1940.

== Life and work ==

=== Early life ===
Vsevolod Meyerhold was born Karl Kasimir Theodor Meyerhold in Penza on to Russian-German wine manufacturer Friedrich Emil Meyerhold and his Baltic German wife, Alvina Danilovna (). He was the youngest of eight children. His father came from an old noble family Meyerhold von Ritterholm. The elder Meyerhold emigrated to Russia in the 1850s.

After completing school in 1895, Meyerhold studied law at Moscow University but never completed his degree. He was torn between studying theatre or a career as a violinist. However, he failed his audition to become the second violinist in the University orchestra and in 1896 joined the Moscow Philharmonic Dramatic School.

On his 21st birthday, he converted from Lutheranism to Orthodox Christianity and accepted &quot;Vsevolod&quot; as an Orthodox Christian name (after the Russian writer Vsevolod Garshin, whose prose he loved).

=== Early career ===
Meyerhold began acting in 1896 as a student of the Moscow Philharmonic Dramatic School under the guidance of Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, co-founder with Konstantin Stanislavsky of the Moscow Art Theatre. At the MAT, Meyerhold played 18 roles, such as Vasiliy Shuiskiy in &quot;Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich&quot; and Ivan the Terrible in &quot;The Death of Ivan the Terrible&quot; (both by Aleksey Tolstoy). In 1898, in the first successful production of Chekhov&#x27;s first play, &quot;The Seagull&quot;, Meyerhold played the lead male role, opposite Chekhov&#x27;s future wife, Olga Knipper.

After leaving the MAT in 1902, wanting to break free of the highly naturalistic &#x27;missing fourth wall&#x27; productions of Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko, Meyerhold participated in a number of theatrical projects, as both a director and actor. Each project was an arena for experiment and creation of new staging methods. Meyerhold was one of the most fervent advocates of Symbolism in theatre, especially when he worked as the chief producer of the Vera Komissarzhevskaya theatre in 1906–1907. He was invited back to the MAT around this time to pursue his experimental ideas.

Meyerhold continued theatrical innovation during the decade 1907–1917, while working with the imperial theatres in St. Petersburg. He introduced classical plays in an innovative manner, and staged works of controversial contemporary authors like Fyodor Sologub, Zinaida Gippius, and Alexander Blok. In these plays, Meyerhold tried to return acting to the traditions of &quot;Commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;, rethinking them for the contemporary theatrical reality. His theoretical concepts of the &quot;conditional theatre&quot; were elaborated in his book &quot;On Theatre&quot; in 1913.

=== Career under communism ===
On the day when the February Revolution broke out – on 25 February, under the old style calendar then used in Russia – Meyerhold&#x27;s production of &quot;Masquerade&quot; by Mikhail Lermontov had a dress rehearsal at the Alexandrinsky Theatre, in front of an audience that included the poet Anna Akhmatova. That evening has been described as &quot;the last act of the tragedy of the old regime, when the Petersburg elite went to enjoy themselves at this splendidly luxurious production in the midst of the chaos and confusion.&quot; Sergei Eisenstein, who was then a teenager but would later be a world-renowned film director, desperately wanted to see the production, having heard that it featured clowns, but having made his way across the city that was in the throes of a revolution was disappointed to discover that the Alexandrinsky was closed.

Meyerhold was one of the first prominent Russian artists to welcome the Bolshevik Revolution – and one of only five out of 120 who accepted an invitation to meet the new People&#x27;s Commissar for Enlightenment, Anatoly Lunacharsky in November 1917. (Among the others were the poets Alexander Blok and Vladimir Mayakovsky.) He joined the Bolshevik Party in 1918, narrowly escaping execution when he was caught on the wrong side of the battle lines during the civil war. He became an official of the Theatre Division (TEO) of the Commissariat of Education and Enlightenment. In 1918–1919, Meyerhold formed an alliance with Olga Kameneva, the head of the Division. Together, they tried to radicalize Russian theatres, effectively nationalizing them under Bolshevik control. Meyerhold came down with tuberculosis in May 1919 and had to leave for the south. In his absence, the head of the Commissariat, Anatoly Lunacharsky, secured Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s permission to revise government policy in favor of more traditional theatres and dismissed Kameneva in June 1919.

After returning to Moscow, Meyerhold founded his own theatre in 1920, which was known from 1923 as the Meyerhold Theatre until 1938. Meyerhold confronted the principles of theatrical academism, claiming that they are incapable of finding a common language with the new reality. Meyerhold&#x27;s methods of scenic constructivism and circus-style effects were used in his most successful works of the time. Some of these works included Nikolai Erdman&#x27;s &quot;The Mandate&quot;, Mayakovsky&#x27;s &quot;Mystery-Bouffe&quot;, Fernand Crommelynck&#x27;s &quot;Le Cocu magnifique&quot; (&quot;The Magnanimous Cuckold&quot;) and Aleksandr Sukhovo-Kobylin&#x27;s &quot;Tarelkin&#x27;s Death&quot;. Mayakovsky collaborated with Meyerhold several times, and was said to have written &quot;The Bedbug&quot; especially for him; Meyerhold continued to stage Mayakovsky&#x27;s productions even after the latter&#x27;s suicide.

=== Acting techniques ===
The actors participating in Meyerhold&#x27;s productions acted according to the principle of &quot;biomechanics&quot; (only distantly related to the present scientific use of the term), the system of actor training that was later taught in a special school created by Meyerhold.
Meyerhold&#x27;s acting technique had fundamental principles at odds with the American method actor&#x27;s conception. While method acting melded the character with the actor&#x27;s own personal memories to create the character&#x27;s internal motivation, Meyerhold connected psychological and physiological processes. He had actors focus on learning gestures and movements as a way of expressing emotion physically. Following Konstantin Stanislavski&#x27;s lead, he said that the emotional state of an actor was inextricably linked to his physical state (and vice versa), and that one could call up emotions in performance by practicing and assuming poses, gestures, and movements. He developed a number of body expressions that his actors would use to portray specific emotions and characters. (Stanislavski was also at odds with Method acting, because like Meyerhold, his approach was psychophysical.)

=== His influence ===
Meyerhold gave initial boosts to the stage careers of some of the most distinguished comic actors of the USSR, including Sergey Martinson, Igor Ilyinsky and Erast Garin. His landmark production of Nikolai Gogol&#x27;s &quot;The Government Inspector&quot; (1926) was described as the following:

Energetic, mischievous, charming Ilyinsky left his post to the nervous, fragile, suddenly freezing, grotesquely anxious Garin. Energy was replaced by trance, the dynamic with the static, happy jesting humour with bitter and glum satire.

Meyerhold also gave a start to his one time assistant of &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot; Matvey Dubrovin, who later created his own theater in Leningrad.

In autumn 1921, Meyerhold was appointed head of the State Higher Theatre Workshops, in Moscow, where one of his first students was Sergei Eisenstein, who later wrote

The God-like, incomparable Meyerhold, I beheld him then for the first time and I was to worship him all my life.

But they fell out, apparently because Eisenstein failed to treat the older man with sufficient deference, for which he was, as he put it, &quot;expelled from the Gates of Heaven.&quot; In his films, Eisenstein used actors who worked in Meyerhold&#x27;s tradition. He also cast actors based on what they looked like and their expression, and followed Meyerhold&#x27;s stylized acting methods. In &quot;Strike&quot;, for instance, the bourgeois are always obese, drinking, eating, and smoking, whereas the workers are more athletic.
For the original production of &quot;The Bedbug&quot;, in February 1929, Meyerhold hired the young Dmitri Shostakovich as a pianist. Many years later, Shostakovich reputedly recalled: &quot;It&#x27;s impossible to imagine now how popular Meyerhold was. Everyone knew him, even those who had no interest or connection with the theatre or art. In the circus, clowns always made jokes about Meyerhold. They go for instant laughs in the circus, and they wouldn&#x27;t sing ditties about people the audience wouldn&#x27;t recognise immediately. They even used to sell combs called Meyerhold.&quot;

=== Repression ===
In the early 1930s, Joseph Stalin launched a campaign to bring Soviet artists to heel, and compel them all to observe the rules of &#x27;socialist realism&#x27;, which precluded avant-garde art and experimentation, and any art form reckoned to be &#x27;formalist&#x27;, in that the artist had paid more attention to the form of a work than to its political message. After Shostakovich had been singled out as being guilty of &#x27;formalism&#x27;, in January 1936, Meyerhold evidently surmised that he would soon be a target, and in March delivered a talk entitled &quot;Meyer Against Meyerholdism&quot; in which he said – reportedly to &#x27;thunderous applause&#x27; – that &quot;the path to simplicity is not an easy one. Each artist goes at his own pace, and they must not lose their distinctive way of walking... Soviet subject matter is often a smoke screen to conceal mediocrity.&quot; A year later, in April 1937, his wife, the actress Zinaida Reich, wrote Stalin a long letter alleging that her husband was the victim of a conspiracy by Trotskyists and former members of the disbanded Russian Association of Proletarian Writers. The letter was not answered. In December 1937, Stalin&#x27;s crony, Lazar Kaganovich went to a production at the Meyerhold Theatre, and walked out in disgust. The theatre was closed, by order of the Politburo, on 7 January 1938, on the grounds that &#x27;throughout its entire existence, the Meyerhold Theatre has been unable to free itself from thoroughly bourgeois Formalist positions&#x27;, his works were proclaimed antagonistic and alien to the Soviet people.

=== Arrest and death ===

The ailing Stanislavsky, who was the director of an opera theatre now known as Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchenko Theatre, invited Meyerhold to be his assistant – an invitation that surprised many in Moscow, given their long standing artistic differences. Stanislavsky died soon afterwards, in August 1938. His dying wish was &quot;Take care of Meyerhold; he is my sole heir in the theatre – here or anywhere else.&quot; Meyerhold directed his theatre for nearly a year, and was engaged with producing the première of Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Semyon Kotko&quot;, when he was instructed that he was to choreograph a spectacle in Leningrad involving 30,000 athletes. On 15 June 1939, he addressed a conference of theatre directors, in the presence of Andrey Vyshinsky, the state prosecutor who had presided over the infamous Moscow show trials. His speech was not reported in the Soviet press, giving rise to a report that he had declared, defiantly:

This is from a version of the speech written up later by the emigre musician Yuri Yelagin, from notes he said that he made at the conference – but its accuracy is disputed. After the speech, he returned to Leningrad, and was arrested on arrival on 20 June 1939. Shortly afterwards, intruders broke into his flat and repeatedly stabbed his wife, Zinaida Reich, who died from her injuries. Taken to NKVD headquarters in Moscow, and placed in the hands of the notorious torturer Lev Shvartzman, Meyerhold broke down and confessed to being a British and Japanese spy. In his final days, he wrote a letter to the head of the Soviet government Vyacheslav Molotov, which was retained in police files, where it was discovered after the dissolution of the USSR by the journalist Vitaly Shentalinsky. In it, he wrote:

He was sentenced to death by firing squad on 1 February 1940, and executed the next day. The Soviet Supreme Court cleared him of all charges in 1955, during the first wave of de-Stalinization.

== Marriage and family ==
Meyerhold married his first wife, Olga Munt, in 1896 and together they had three daughters. He later met the actress Zinaida Reich when she began studying with him. They fell in love and he divorced his wife; Reich was already divorced and had two children of her own. They married in 1922 or 1924.

<text>The River Wey is a chalk stream flowing through Dorset in south west England.

==Course==
The river is about long. It rises in Upwey, where the spring forms Upwey Wishing Well, at the foot of the South Dorset Downs, a ridge of chalk hills that separate Weymouth from Dorchester. Most of the course is in the built-up area of Weymouth, running through the former villages (now suburbs) of Upwey, Broadwey, Nottington, and Radipole, through Radipole Lake and into Weymouth Harbour. From source to mouth it falls around .

==History==
The river has been important since Roman times, when Radipole Lake was used as a reservoir. The town of Weymouth was established by two harbour villages (Weymouth itself and Melcombe Regis) either side of the mouth. The river was important for milling during the 18th and 19th centuries, when there were five water mills based along it. All five of the millers needed carefully to co-ordinate their activities to ensure a reliable flow of water.

The source is an important water supply. There is a large pumping station at Friar Waddon, drawing from the source of the Wey, which is the main water supply for the Isle of Portland. Wessex Water is licensed to pump per day.

==Environment==
The river is important for wildlife; Radipole Lake is a national nature reserve run by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. It has been a Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1979. The spring water of the Wey is used by the Upwey fish farm, which also uses the river to grow watercress. All water in the farm is recycled back to the river.

<doc id="743596" wikidata="Q2351897" url="?curid=743596" title="Interstate 296">
<text>Interstate 296 (I-296) is a part of the Interstate Highway System in the US state of Michigan. It is a north–south state trunkline highway that runs for entirely within the Grand Rapids area. Its termini are I-196 near downtown Grand Rapids and I-96 on the north side of Grand Rapids in Walker. For most of its length, the Interstate runs concurrently with U.S. Highway 131 (US 131), which continues as a freeway built to Interstate Highway standards north and south of the shorter I-296. The highway was first proposed in the late 1950s and opened in December 1962, but the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) has since eliminated all signage for I-296 and removed the designation from their official state map. The designation is therefore unsigned, but still listed on the Interstate Highway System route log maintained by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).

== Route description ==

I-296 begins at the I-196 interchange west of the Grand River and downtown Grand Rapids. For a short distance within the interchange, the three northbound lanes are on the left and the three southbound lanes are on the right, contrary to the normal traffic arrangement in the US. This anomaly is reversed north of the ramps for I-196 as the southbound lanes pass over the northbound lanes. Running parallel to the Grand River on the west bank, the freeway designation begins across the river from the 6th Street Bridge Park and Belknap Hill north of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum and the DeVos Place Convention Center. The west side of the freeway faces residential neighborhoods and the east side borders commercial businesses and the river. South of the Ann Street interchange, the highway crosses a line of the Grand Rapids Eastern Railroad. After crossing both the railroad and Ann Street, the highway widens to allow for a grassy median. The freeway leaves Grand Rapids and enters Walker north of Ann Street.

Approaching I-96 from the south, the freeway passes east of the former DeltaPlex Arena, and the median widens further across the river from Comstock Riverside Park in Walker. An extra lane is added on the left, widening the freeway to four lanes. Unsigned I-296 occupies the left two lanes that form the left exit for I-96 from US 131. At the split between I-296 and US 131, I-296 curves northwesterly, and US 131 curves northeasterly to follow a bend in the Grand River. Once I-296 diverges from US 131, the highway crosses a rail line owned by CSX Transportation and passes over West River Drive. To the northwest of these crossings, exits emerge on the right for eastbound I-96 and the left for northbound M-37 (Alpine Avenue). Past these exits, I-296 merges into westbound I-96 and terminates. Southbound unsigned I-296 begins where the ramps to US 131 southbound split from eastbound I-96 at the Alpine Avenue overpass, collecting an on-ramp from M-37 and then merging with southbound US 131 north of Ann Street.

== History ==
The development of a freeway along the modern-day I-296/US 131 corridor was proposed in the 1950s. The 1955 &quot;General Location of National System of Interstate Highways&quot;, an early platform for what would become the Interstate Highway System, contained an inset of the proposed freeways in and around the Grand Rapids area including a north–south freeway near the downtown area. Designated as part of the Interstate Highway System in 1957, I-296&#x27;s construction was funded by the federal government.

The US 131 freeway was officially opened at 10 a.m. on December 17, 1962, between Pearl Street and (at the time) the I-196/US 16 freeway north of downtown. This freeway section encompassed all of I-296, which would connect I-196 north of town with I-96 downtown. (The I-96 and I-196 designations were later flipped west of Grand Rapids.) M-37 was relocated in Grand Rapids to utilize I-96 around the northeast side of town instead of I-296/US 131 in 1969.

At the end of the 1970s, MDOT took part in a FHWA-backed initiative called the Positive Guidance Demonstration Project, and the two agencies audited signage practices in the vicinity of the I-96/M-37 and I-296/US 131 interchange in Walker. MDOT determined that usage of the I-296 designation was &quot;a potential source of confusion for motorists.&quot; FHWA agreed with the department&#x27;s proposal to eliminate all signage and public map references to the designation in April 1979. MDOT then petitioned the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) on June 22, 1979, for their permission to make the change, saying &quot;it is felt that the I-296 designation serves no useful purpose other than to designate an Interstate routing.&quot; AASHTO approved the request on October 13. On October 24 that year, MDOT also requested formal permission from the FHWA to remove all signage and map references to I-296. The FHWA granted permission on December 3, 1979, on the condition that MDOT would continue to use the designation on official documents. The approval explicitly retained the highway in the Interstate system for funding and other purposes. The last state map to show the I-296 designation was published in 1979, as the 1980 map lacks any reference to the designation. Other maps, like the one published by the Kent County Road Commission, occasionally show I-296, and FHWA includes the designation in their &quot;Route Log and Finder List&quot; for the Interstate Highway System.

<text>Rheinland Nature Park (&quot;Naturpark Rheinland&quot;) is a nature park in North Rhine-Westphalia, situated between Bergheim, Kerpen, Erftstadt, Euskirchen, Königswinter, Bornheim, Bonn, Brühl, Hürth, Frechen and Pulheim. It covers an area of about 880 km2.

== Ville-Seen-Platte ==
Roughly translated, this would be the &#x27;plateau of lakes in the Ville&#x27;.

In the vicinity of Erftstadt, Brühl and Hürth many small and large lakes have been created due to coal mining. The reforestation of the area was begun in 1920 by planting beech, pine, oak and larch trees. Today, there are about forty lakes that have sprung from the mining operations.

<doc id="743602" wikidata="Q5182981" url="?curid=743602" title="Fastway (bus rapid transit)">
<text>Fastway is a bus rapid transit network in Surrey and West Sussex, United Kingdom, linking Crawley with Gatwick Airport and Horley, the first to be constructed outside a major city. It uses specially adapted buses that can either be steered by the driver or operate as &quot;self steering&quot; guided buses along a specially constructed track. Fastway is operated by Metrobus, using Scania OmniCity, Wright StreetLite, Volvo B7RLE / Wright Eclipse 2 and Wright GB Kite Hydroliner buses.

==Overview==
Fastway aims to improve bus services in the Crawley, Gatwick and Horley area. The project included construction of new bus lanes, including guided bus lanes, construction of new bus waiting shelters and provision of electronic real-time passenger information and a fleet of new low-floor buses for Metrobus (part of the Go Ahead Group)

Construction work began in May 2002, and was scheduled to be completed by June 2005. In October 2006, major work stopped, having completed around 60% of the planned work - 1.5 km guided and 5.8 km unguided bus lanes were constructed, of the planned 2.5 km guided and 8.8 km unguided lanes. The planned 24 traffic lights and 11 roundabouts were changed to 40 traffic lights and 2 roundabouts.

==History==
Phase 1 (Service 10) commenced in September 2003 between Bewbush and Gatwick, £50,000 over budget and four months behind schedule. The opening was attended by Tony McNulty MP, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, and local dignitaries. The service was extended from 21- to 24-hour operation in May 2004 and now runs every 7 minutes during the day and every 20–30 minutes in the early morning, evening and Sunday.

In July 2005 the project was more than £6 million over budget. An independent inquiry was launched to investigate the losses, led by a task force from East Sussex County Council. The results of the inquiry were published in December 2005. ESCC concluded West Sussex had shown a pattern of &quot;ineffective accountability, complacency, ineffective risk management and a lack of clear ownership of the financial management responsibilities&quot;.

On 27 August 2005 Fastway service 20 was introduced, running between Broadfield, Three Bridges, Manor Royal, Gatwick Airport, Horley and Langshott. On Mondays to Saturdays it runs approximately every 20-30 minutes during the day, and every 30 minutes in the early morning, late evening and all-day Sunday. Service 20 runs now 24-hours.

==Decision making process==
Bus rapid transit was chosen to minimise start-up costs, and remove the need for public consultation exercises.

Fastway is the first bus rapid transit system in the world to be built outside a major city by a partnership of local authorities and private companies with automatic vehicle location, pre-trip and in-trip passenger information and automatic traffic signal priority from the start.

==Funding==

In June 2002 the official Fastway website was updated to show a cost of £27 million, with just under £10 million provided by the government.

In September 2003, the Go-Ahead group withdrew their £3 million commitment to the project. The government increased its contribution to cover this as well as other rising costs, raising its contribution to £16.642 million.

By July 2005, West Sussex County Council&#x27;s share of the project&#x27;s cost had increased five-fold from £6.2 million to almost £30 million, resulting in external audit and probe into the programme. The inquiry found no wrongdoing by a single employee of the council when it concluded in December 2005, however did state that the council had &quot;ineffective accountability, complacency, ineffective risk management and a lack of clear ownership of the financial management responsibilities&quot;.

==Services==
The Fastway system is currently formed of three bus routes, all of which are operated by Metrobus:

===Route 10===
Route 10 is the most frequent service on the network. It operates between Kilnwood Vale and Gatwick Airport via Bewbush, Broadfield, Crawley Town Centre and Manor Royal. It runs every 10 minutes during daytime on weekdays and Saturdays, every 12 minutes on Sundays and every 30 minutes overnight.

===Route 20===
Route 20 operates between Pease Pottage and Langshott via Broadfield, Crawley Town Centre, Three Bridges, Gatwick Airport and Horley. It runs every 20 minutes during daytime on weekdays and Saturdays, every 30 minutes on Sundays and approximately every 45 minutes overnight.

===Route 100===
Route 100 is the longest route on the network. It operates between Maidenbower and Redhill via Three Bridges, Crawley Town Centre, Manor Royal, Gatwick Airport, Horley and East Surrey Hospital. It runs every 20 minutes on weekdays and Saturdays, every 30 minutes on Sundays and hourly overnight.

==Promoters==

The Fastway project was promoted and funded by a public-private partnership. The consortium included West Sussex County Council, Surrey County Council, Crawley Borough Council, Reigate and Banstead Borough Council, BAA Gatwick, British Airways. There is also support from the UK Department for Transport.

The project initially included a £3 million contribution by Metrobus, the bus operator, and its parent company, the Go-Ahead Group, but this was withdrawn after construction had started, and the money was replaced by West Sussex County Council.

The projected cost started at £27 million and was later revised to £32 million, then £35 million, with between £7.5 and £10 million from West Sussex County Council. The final cost of the scheme is still unknown, but has risen from the original estimates and was described as £6 million over budget

Metrobus has stated that passenger figures are up 10 percent, with 35 percent of journeys being to and from Gatwick. One million passengers were carried in the first seven months of operation.

==Opposition==
It has been noted that, while successful at reducing road traffic, Fastway has not tackled gaps in the existing public transport network, particularly Pound Hill.

==Accidents==
On 31 October 2005 a Fastway bus travelling along Breezehurst Drive crashed into a terraced house. Two elderly residents were evacuated, and the damage required the house to be demolished. Four passengers suffered minor injuries. According to Metrobus, the bus involved in the incident was a Scania OmniCity bus number 550 (registration YN05 HCF). Another accident was reported in the same place in 2008.

==Passenger numbers==
A survey in 2006 showed average passenger numbers during the 7-9am peak were 5, one for each bus
 By 2008 as the system became established the West Sussex County Council indicated that bus use in Crawley had increased by 25% following quality improvements.

<text>John Frederick Miller (active 1772–1796) was an English illustrator, mainly of botanical subjects.

Miller was the son of the artist Johann Sebastian Müller (1715 – c. 1790). Miller, along with his brother James, produced paintings from the sketches made by Sydney Parkinson on James Cook&#x27;s first voyage. He accompanied Joseph Banks on his expedition to Iceland in 1772.

Between 1776 and 1785 Miller published 60 hand-coloured engravings in his &quot;Icones animalium et plantarum&quot; or &quot;Various subjects of Natural History, wherein are delineated Birds, Animals and many curious Plants, &amp;c&quot;. Very few copies of this work survive. The plates include binomial names, some of which contain the oldest published specific epithet and therefore have priority over later scientific names. There are seven species of bird for which Miller&#x27;s plate is the holotype; these include the king penguin, the secretarybird, the crested caracara and the extinct Tahiti crake.

The plates were re-issued in 1796 with text supplied by George Shaw under a new title: &quot;Cimelia Physica&quot; or &quot;Figures of rare and curious quadrupeds, birds, &amp;c. together with several of the most elegant plants&quot;.

<text>Radipole Lake is a lake on the River Wey, now in the English coastal town of Weymouth, Dorset, once in Radipole, the village and parish of the same name. Along the western shore of the lake, and between Radipole and the town centre of Weymouth, now lies the modern suburb of Southill.

The lake is a nature reserve run by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, as it is an important habitat for reedbed birds. The Wild Weymouth Discovery Centre at Radipole Lake features nature and bird exhibits and programs, trails and viewing blinds.

Radipole Lake is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and part of the geographical area covered by this designation is owned by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.

The lake flows into Weymouth Harbour.

<doc id="743621" wikidata="Q2906921" url="?curid=743621" title="Ger toshav">
<text>Ger toshav (, &quot;ger&quot;: &quot;foreigner&quot; or &quot;alien&quot; + &quot;toshav&quot;: &quot;resident&quot;, lit. &quot;resident alien&quot;) is a halakhic term used in Judaism to designate the legal status of a Gentile (non-Jew) living in the Land of Israel who does not want to convert to Judaism but agrees to observe the Seven Laws of Noah, a set of imperatives which, according to the Talmud, were given by God as a binding set of universal moral laws for the &quot;sons of Noah&quot;—that is, all of humanity. A &quot;ger toshav&quot;, especially one who decides to follow the Noahic covenant out of religious belief rather than ethical reasoning, is commonly deemed a &quot;Righteous Gentile&quot; (, &quot;Chassid Umot ha-Olam&quot;: &quot;Pious People of the World&quot;), and is assured of a place in the World to Come (&quot;Olam Ha-Ba&quot;).

==Definition==

A &quot;ger toshav&quot; (&quot;resident alien&quot;) is a Gentile (non-Jew) living in the Land of Israel who agrees to follow the Seven Laws of Noah. The theological basis for the seven commandments of the Noahic Covenant is said to be derived interpretatively from demands addressed to Adam and to Noah, who are believed to be the progenitors of humankind in Judaism, and therefore to be regarded as universal moral laws. The seven commandments of the Noahic Covenant to which the &quot;ger toshav&quot; agrees to be bound are enumerated in the Babylonian Talmud (&quot;Avodah Zarah&quot; 8:4, &quot;Sanhedrin&quot; 56a-b):
# Do not worship idols.
# Do not curse God.
# Do not murder.
# Do not commit adultery or sexual immorality.
# Do not steal.
# Do not eat flesh torn from a living animal.
# Establish courts of justice.

The &quot;Encyclopedia Talmudit&quot;, edited by rabbi Shlomo Yosef Zevin, states that after the giving of the Torah, the Jewish people were no longer included in the category of the sons of Noah; however, Maimonides (&quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;, &quot;Hilkhot M&#x27;lakhim&quot; 9:1) indicates that the seven commandments are also part of the Torah, and the Babylonian Talmud (&quot;Sanhedrin&quot; 59a, see also Tosafot ad. loc.) states that Jews are obligated in all things that Gentiles are obligated in, albeit with some differences in the details. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia Talmudit&quot;, most medieval Jewish authorities considered that all the seven commandments were given to Adam, although Maimonides (&quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;, &quot;Hilkhot M&#x27;lakhim&quot; 9:1) considered the dietary law to have been given to Noah.

The term &quot;ger toshav&quot; may be used in a formal or informal sense. In the formal sense, a &quot;ger toshav&quot; is a Gentile who officially accepts the seven Noahide laws as binding upon themself in the presence of three &quot;haberim&quot; (men of authority), or, according to the rabbinic tradition, before a &quot;beth din&quot; (Jewish rabbinical court). In the Talmud there are two other, differing opinions (&quot;Avodah Zarah&quot;, 64b) that pertain to which commandments the &quot;ger toshav&quot; is required to follow:
# To abstain from idolatrous practices of any kind (detailed in Exodus and Deuteronomy ).
# To uphold all the 613 commandments in rabbinical enumeration, except for the prohibition against eating kosher animals that died by means other than ritual slaughter, or possibly (Meiri) any prohibition not involving &quot;kareth&quot;.

The accepted opinion is that the &quot;ger toshav&quot; must accept the Seven Laws of Noah before a rabbinical court of three. They will receive certain legal protection and privileges from the community, the rules regarding Jewish-Gentile relations are modified, and there is an obligation to render him aid when in need. The restrictions on having a Gentile do work for a Jew on the Shabbat are also greater when the Gentile is a &quot;ger toshav&quot;.

In the informal sense, a &quot;ger toshav&quot; is a Gentile who agrees to follow the seven Noahide laws on his own, or alternatively, simply rejects idolatry (the latter issue is in particular brought up regarding Muslims). According to the rabbinic tradition, a Gentile who agrees to follow the seven Noahide laws, although not before a &quot;beth din&quot;, is still regarded as &quot;Chassid Umot ha-Olam&quot; (&quot;Pious People of the World&quot;), and the observance of the Seven Laws of Noah grants them a place in the World to Come (&quot;Olam Ha-Ba&quot;). There is a debate among the halakhic authorities as to whether the rules regarding a &quot;ger toshav&quot; would apply to the informal case.

The procedure to officially recognize the legal status of &quot;ger toshav&quot; has been discontinued since the cessation of the year of Jubilee with the destruction of the Second Temple of Jerusalem; hence, there are no formal &quot;gerim toshavim&quot; extant today. However, it can be argued that a great deal are &quot;informal&quot; ones, especially since it is possible to be a &quot;Chassid Umot ha-Olam&quot; even when the Jubilee year is not observed.

== Modern times and views ==

Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, encouraged his followers on many occasions to preach the Seven Laws of Noah, devoting some of his addresses to the subtleties of this code. Since the 1990s, Orthodox Jewish rabbis from Israel, most notably those affiliated to Chabad-Lubavitch and religious Zionist organizations, including The Temple Institute, have set up a modern Noahide movement. These Noahide organizations, led by religious Zionist and Orthodox Jewish rabbis, are aimed at non-Jews in order to proselytize among them and commit them to follow the Noahide laws. According to Rachel Z. Feldman, American anthropologist and Assistant Professor of Religious Studies at Dartmouth College, many of the Orthodox Jewish rabbis involved in mentoring Noahides are supporters of the Third Temple movement who believe that the messianic era shall begin with the establishment of a Jewish theocratic state in Israel, supported by communities of Noahides worldwide:

Feldman describes Noahidism as a &quot;new world religion&quot; that &quot;carv[es] out a place for non-Jews in the messianic Zionist project&quot; and &quot;affirms the superiority of Judaism and Jewish biblical right to the Land of Israel, in line with the aims of the growing messianic Third Temple Movement in Jerusalem.&quot; She characterizes Noahide ideology in the Philippines and elsewhere in the global south as having a &quot;markedly racial dimension&quot; constructed around &quot;an essential categorical difference between Jews and Noahides&quot;. David Novak, professor of Jewish theology and ethics at the University of Toronto, has denounced the modern Noahide movement by stating that &quot;If Jews are telling Gentiles what to do, it’s a form of imperialism&quot;.

According to the Jewish philosopher and professor Menachem Kellner&#x27;s study on Maimonidean texts (1991), a &quot;ger toshav&quot; could be a transitional stage on the way to becoming a &quot;righteous alien&quot; (, &quot;ger tzedek&quot;), i.e. a full convert to Judaism. He conjectures that, according to Maimonides, only a full &quot;ger tzedek&quot; would be found during the Messianic era. Furthermore, Kellner criticizes the assumption within Orthodox Judaism that there is an &quot;ontological divide between Jews and Gentiles&quot;, which he believes is contrary to what Maimonides thought and the Torah teaches, stating that &quot;Gentiles as well as Jews are fully created in the image of God&quot;.

According to Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the status of &quot;ger toshav&quot; will continue to exist, even in the Messianic era. This is based on the statement in &quot;Hilkhot M&#x27;lakhim&quot; 12:5 that lit. “all the world (&quot;kol ha&#x27;olam&quot;) will be nothing but to know G‑d.&quot; In its plain meaning, he asserts, &quot;kol ha&#x27;olam&quot; also includes Gentiles. As proof, he cites 11:4, which deals with the Messianic era, and the similar term &quot;ha&#x27;olam kulo&quot;, &quot;the world in its entirety&quot;, refers to Gentiles. Continuing the text in &quot;Hilkhot M&#x27;lakhim&quot; 12:5, Maimonides explicitly changes the topic to Jews by using the term &quot;Yisra&#x27;el&quot;, explaining that &quot;Therefore, the Jews will be great sages and know the hidden matters, grasping the knowledge of their Creator according to the full extent of human potential&quot;, indicating that Jews and Gentiles will co-exist in the time of the Messiah. In any case, even when there is a Jewish king and a Sanhedrin, and all the twelve tribes live in the Land of Israel, Jewish law does not permit forcing someone to convert and become a &quot;ger tzedek&quot; against his will.

===High Council of ===
A &quot;High Council of &quot;, set up to represent Noahide communities around the world, was endorsed by a group that claimed to be the new Sanhedrin. The High Council of consists of a group of Noahides who, at the request of the nascent Sanhedrin, gathered in Jerusalem on 10 January 2006 to be recognized as an international Noahide organization for the purpose of serving as a bridge between the nascent Sanhedrin and Noahides worldwide. There were ten initial members who flew to Israel and pledged to uphold the Seven Laws of Noah and to conduct themselves under the authority of the Noahide (religious court) of the nascent Sanhedrin.

=== Non-necessity of conversion ===
According to Christine Hayes, an American scholar of ancient Judaism and early Christianity serving as the Sterling Professor of Religious Studies in Classical Judaica at Yale University, the &quot;gerim&quot; were not necessarily Gentile converts in the Hebrew Bible, whether in the modern or rabbinic sense. Nonetheless, they were granted many rights and privileges when they lived in the Land of Israel. For example, they could offer sacrifices, actively participate in Israelite politics, keep their distinct ethnic identity for many generations, inherit tribal allotments, etc.

<text>Jingjintang Expressway (), also known as the Jingtang Expressway, links Beijing via central Tianjin to the Tanggu District in eastern Tianjin. 143 kilometres in length, it crosses the jurisdictions of Beijing and Tianjin municipalities and Hebei province.

Tolls apply as of Dayangfang near the Eastern 5th Ring Road in Beijing until the Tanggu/TEDA exit. The expressway uses a networked toll system across all jurisdictions and is managed by Huabei (North China) Expressways.

This route is now part of G2 Beijing–Shanghai Expressway and Tianjin () expressway.

==Route==
The Jingjintang Expressway runs through the municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin, as well as Hebei province.

Beijing (Fenzhongsi - Shibalidian - Dayangfang - Majuqiao - Caiyu) - Langfang (Hebei) - Tianjin (Yangcun - Central Tianjin - Tianjin Airport - Tanggu District/TEDA).

==History==
The expressway opened on September 25, 1993, and was the first express to be built to more recent standards.

This expressway has slashed driving time from Beijing to Tianjin to around one hour, and has created a corridor between Beijing and Tianjin.

===Accidents===
Areas of the expressway are many times very foggy and that has led to a number of accidents.

On October 19, 2004, seven vehicles involved in three accidents plunged into each other in early morning fog, killing two and injuring many more on the stretch of expressway from Beijing to Tianjin, at the stretch between Majuqiao and Caiyu.

==Parallel Expressways==
With a history of over ten years, the expressway was beginning to feel the crunch of massive traffic, especially the increase of heavy lorries. As a result, at least two other expressways linking Beijing to Tianjin were constructed.

A variation of routes leaves Beijing heading toward Pinggu District, and links with the Jinji Expressway.

==Road Conditions==
===Speed Limit===
Uniform maximum speed limit of 110 km/h (sparsely signposted at times) outside of Beijing; Beijing section now only 90 km/h. However, the Beijing section from Fenzhongsi through Shibalidian has a mixed speed limit of 70 km/h or 80 km/h (only when leaving Beijing).

===Tolls===
Tolls apply for the stretch east of Dayangfang until Tanggu.

===Lanes===
4 lanes (2 up, 2 down), with emergency shoulders. &quot;Exception:&quot; Section in Beijing (Fenzhongsi - Shibalidian) has 6 lanes (3 up, 3 down).

==Major Exits==
Fenzhongsi, Dayangfang, Majuqiao, Caiyu, Langfang, Yangcun, Yixingbu, Central Tianjin, Tianjin Airport, Tanggu

==Service Areas==
Majuqiao, Xuguantun, Dongli.

==Connections==
Ring Roads of Beijing: Connects with the SW 3rd Ring Road at Fenzhongsi, the SW 4th Ring Road at Shibalidian, the SW 5th Ring Road at Dayangfang and the SW 6th Ring Road at Majuqiao.
Jinghu Expressway: Connects with the Jinghu Expressway at Yixingbu.
Jinji Expressway: Connects with the newly opened Jinji Expressway at Central Tianjin exit (Jinzhong Road).
Tianjin Outer Ring Road: Connects at Yixingbu.

==Safety==
Upon its completion, the PRC authorities and state media spared the least of efforts in trumpeting the creation of the Jingjintang Expressway, promoting it to the bitter end, and creating an illusion that the expressway was &quot;it&quot; in the PRC&#x27;s expressway world. As a result of this widespread promotion, the expressway was known as the &quot;golden expressway&quot;.

In November 2004, however, things looked very different. Incessant traffic jams, breakdowns, and chaos on the expressway earned it a more popular nickname—the &quot;road of death&quot;.

The very problem lies within the expressway itself—massive traffic. The expressway was designed for a traffic audience of 50,000 vehicles a day—and apparently, not a vehicle more, as the current average of 59,000 vehicles a day is stretching the expressway to its limits. Meanwhile, during periods of high use, 130,000 vehicles are reported to be using the expressway -- &quot;per day&quot;.

Compounding the problem is a very narrow (2.4 m in width) hard shoulder, and the lack of emergency bays. Compound that with fog in the southeastern Beijing section, and no lights at night outside of the 4th Ring Road (Beijing), and one understands why the label &quot;road of death&quot; sticks so well to the expressway today.

==Traffic==
China was a different country back in 1993, when the expressway first opened. For a start, there were fewer drivers, and traffic—especially expressway traffic—was less of a problem. Therefore, when the expressway opened in September 1993, it could cope rather well with just two lanes in one direction—for over a hundred kilometres.

Things changed in the late 1990s. Private citizens could apply for driver&#x27;s licences with greater ease, and traffic as a whole increased on PRC roads. The situation on the expressway in 2004, therefore, is different from that of 1993.

A 2004 traffic jam—or traffic disturbance—that upset just one lane (not to mention more than one lane), would upset the entire expressway. Traffic would begin to pile up for kilometres and hours on end. The relative lack of exits (only ten for the entire stretch) could further compound the problem.

As it forms a vital corridor for traffic from Tianjin and Tanggu, the expressway is often full of lorries. Two lorries overtaking each other would shrink average speed limits for the car following behind considerably—from the legal 110 km/h down to approximately 80 km/h or sometimes even 60 km/h.

<doc id="743629" wikidata="Q611571" url="?curid=743629" title="Bleeding diathesis">
<text>In medicine (hematology), bleeding diathesis is an unusual susceptibility to bleed (hemorrhage) mostly due to hypocoagulability (a condition of irregular and slow blood clotting), in turn caused by a coagulopathy (a defect in the system of coagulation). Therefore, this may result in the reduction of platelets being produced and leads to excessive bleeding. Several types of coagulopathy are distinguished, ranging from mild to lethal. Coagulopathy can be caused by thinning of the skin (Cushing&#x27;s syndrome), such that the skin is weakened and is bruised easily and frequently without any trauma or injury to the body. Also, coagulopathy can be contributed by impaired wound healing or impaired clot formation.

==Signs and symptoms==

===Complications===
Following are some complications of coagulopathies, some of them caused by their treatments:

==Causes==
While there are several possible causes, they generally result in excessive bleeding and a lack of clotting.

=== Acquired ===
Acquired causes of coagulopathy include anticoagulation with warfarin, liver failure, vitamin K deficiency and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Additionally, the hemotoxic venom from certain species of snakes can cause this condition, for example Bothrops, rattlesnakes and other species of viper. Viral hemorrhagic fevers include dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome.
Leukemia may also cause coagulopathy. Furthermore, cystic fibrosis has been known to cause bleeding diathesis, especially in undiagnosed infants, due to malabsorption of fat soluble vitamins like vitamin K.

=== Autoimmune causes of acquired coagulation disorders ===
There are autoimmune causes of coagulation disorders. They include acquired antibodies to coagulation factors, termed inhibitors of coagulation. The main inhibitor is directed against clotting factor VIII. Another example is antiphospholipid syndrome, an autoimmune, hypercoagulable state.

===Causes other than coagulation===
Bleeding diathesis may also be caused by impaired wound healing (as in scurvy), or by thinning of the skin, such as in Cushing&#x27;s syndrome.

==Genetic==
Some people lack genes that typically produce the protein coagulation factors that allow normal clotting. Various types of hemophilia and von Willebrand disease are the major genetic disorders associated with coagulopathy. Rare examples are Bernard–Soulier syndrome, Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome and Glanzmann&#x27;s thrombasthenia. Gene therapy treatments may be a solution as they involve in the insertion of normal genes to replace defective genes causing for the genetic disorder. Gene therapy is a source of active research that hold promise for the future. 

==Diagnosis==

===Comparing coagulation tests===
==Treatments==
Consult a hematologist and have regular blood check ups. Have an early diagnostic test for any blood disorders or blood diseases including hemophilia, hemorrhage, and sickle-cell anemia. Prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time blood tests are useful to investigate the reason behind the excessive bleeding. The PT evaluates coagulation factors I, II, V, VII and X, while the PTT evaluates coagulation factors I, II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI and XII. The analysis of both tests thus helps to diagnose certain disorders.

Blood transfusion involves the transfer of plasma containing all the necessary coagulating factors (fibrinogen, prothrombin, thromboplastin) to help restore them and to improve the immune defense of the patient after excessive blood loss. Blood transfusion also caused the transfer of platelets that can work along with coagulating factors for blood clotting to commence.

Different drugs can be prescribed depending on the type of disease. Vitamins (K, P and C) are essential in case of obstruction to walls of blood vessels. Also, vitamin K is required for the production of blood clotting factors, hence the injection of vitamin K (phytomenadione) is recommended to boost blood clotting.

<doc id="743633" wikidata="Q1203744" url="?curid=743633" title="Shirakawa, Gifu (village)">
<text>is a village located in Ōno District, Gifu Prefecture, Japan. It is best known for being the site of Shirakawa-gō, a small, traditional village showcasing a building style known as &quot;gasshō-zukuri&quot;. Together with Gokayama in Nanto, Toyama, it is one of UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Sites.

, the village had an estimated population of 1,630 in 588 households and a population density of 4.6 persons per km2. The total area of the village was .

==Geography==
Shirakawa is a mountain village located in far northern Gifu Prefecture, bordering Ishikawa Prefecture and Toyama Prefecture on the Ryōhaku Mountains. Mount Hakusan is the highest elevation at . The village&#x27;s area is 95.7% mountainous forests, and its steep places are characteristic. In between the mountains flows the Shō River, which continues to the north into Nanto, Toyama. Most of the population is in its river valley. Since the opening of Hida Tunnel, Shirakawa can be reached within 50 minutes from Takayama, Gifu compared to the earlier three hour drive, and only an hour to Nanto in Toyama.

** Hida
** Takayama
* Ishikawa Prefecture
** Hakusan
* Toyama Prefecture
** Nanto

===Climate===
Shirakawa Village has a humid continental climate (Koppen &quot;Dfa&quot;). It features four distinct seasons with winter being its most recognised. Shirakawa is noted as one of the snowiest places in Japan. Yearly average snowfall amounts average out in excess of 10 meters (415.4&quot;) with snowbanks developing well over 2 meters tall. As a consequence of the frequent heavy snow, characteristically thick thatched roofed gasshō-zukuri (合掌造り) houses were created. With the Hakusan National Park mountain ranges as a background, these sites are major tourist attractions.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Shirakawa has decreased over the past 50 years, with a small uptick around the year 2000.
==History==
The area around Shirakawa was part of traditional Hida Province. During the post-Meiji restoration cadastral reforms, the area was organised into Ōno District, Gifu. The village of Shirakawa was formed on July 1, 1897 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system.

==Economy==
The local economy is dominated strongly by seasonal tourism. Due to the income from the tourists who came to see the &quot;gassho-zukuri&quot; villages, the financial condition of the village has been greatly improved, and tourist traffic increased further once the village became a UNESCO site. However, the increasing number of visitors has resulted in damage to the area from pollution, and by local inhabitants turning their homes into hostels, gift shops and parking lots, which in turn has endangered its World Heritage status. There is also a fear growing that the change to catering to tourists will harm the charm of the area&#x27;s simplicity and fundamental Japanese scenery.

==Education==
Shirakawa has one combined public elementary/junior high school operated by the village government. The town village does not have a high school.

== Transportation ==
=== Railway ===
*Shirakawa village does not have any passenger railway service.

===Highway===
* Tōkai-Hokuriku Expressway

<text>M-25 is a state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan. The route follows an arc-like shape closely along the Lake Huron shore of the Thumb in the eastern Lower Peninsula between Port Huron and Bay City. It serves the lakeshore resorts along Lake Huron and Saginaw Bay and generally lies within sight of the lake and the bay. All is surface road and generally scenic, except for the freeway segment near the junction with Interstate 75 (I-75) and connection into the US Highway 10 (US 10) freeway.

Between Port Huron and Port Austin it is the north–south highway was formerly US 25 before the designation was removed. Between Port Austin and Bay City it is an east–west route that appeared on some maps as US 25 and on some maps as M-25. Since the 1970s, when all of US 25 was deleted north of Cincinnati, Ohio, it is entirely signed as M-25.

==Route description==
===North to Port Austin===
The starting point of M-25 at a junction with Business Loop I-69/Business Loop I-94 (BL I-69/BL I-94) in Port Huron. M-25 is part of the Lake Huron Circle Tour for its entire length. From here M-25 heads north on Pine Grove Avenue until meeting M-136. At this intersection, M-25 turns north on 24th Avenue to Lakeshore Road then runs parallel to the Lake Huron shoreline.

In the community of Lakeport, M-25 passes through Lakeport State Park. Past the park, M-25 changes names from Lakeshore Road to Kimball Road temporarily. M-25 intersects the east end of M-90 blocks from Lake Huron in Lexington. There are public beaches in Lexington and in Port Sanilac. M-25&#x27;s street name changes after the M-46 intersection to that of North Lakeshore Road. The Huron Shores Golf Club is located off the highway north of Port Sanilac at the intersection of Snover Road. Sanilac County has established the Sanilac County Park at the intersection of Downington Road and M-25 south of Richmondville. North of Forestville M-25 is once again called South Lakeshore Road as the highway crosses into Huron County.
Wagener County Park is located off M-25 in the community of Helena. M-25 begins to curve to the northwest in Sand Beach near the Rock Falls Cemetery. In the city of Harbor Beach, M-25 is called Huron Avenue and meets M-142 for the first of two occasions. Here is the Harbor Beach Golf Course on the south side of town as M-25 moves inland through town. North of town, the trunkline parallels an old routing of the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway as it is once again renamed Lakeshore Road. The highway moves farther inland north of Rubicon and Port Hope as it begins to round the tip of the Thumb. In Grindstone City, M-25 loses the Lakeshore Road name in favor of Grindstone Road all the way to Port Austin.

===West to Bay City===
Port Austin is the location of the historical northern terminus of US 25. Through town, M-25 turns north along Lake Street and runs concurrently with the northern end of M-53. The highway turns westward on Port Austin Road along the lake where M-53 terminates; this is also the point where the M-25 signage changes from northbound to westbound. West of town, M-25 turns south along the Saginaw Bay and meets Port Crescent State Park. From here south west, M-25 hugs the bay and its miles of beaches. North of Caseville is the Albert E. Sleeper State Park. Through Caseville, M-25 uses Main Street and passes the city beach off State Street. McKinley is home to the Scenic Golf &amp; Country Club and Wild Fowl Bay. M-25 follows the shore of Wild Fowl Bay, a smaller bay off Saginaw Bay, to the city of Bay Port and the western terminus of M-142 on Fairhaven a smaller community south of Bay Port. From here south, the road is called Unionville Road and turns inland to Sebewaing.

At Unionville, M-25 turns more westerly to round the bottom of Saginaw Bay into Bay City along Bay City-Forestville Road in Tuscola County. In the community of Quanicassee, it transitions to Center Road and crosses into Bay County. M-25 is routed the one-way street pair of 7th Street and McKinley Street before crossing the Veterans Memorial Bridge over the Saginaw River. West of the bridge, the one-way pairing of Jenny Street and Thomas Street are used before the two merge into Thomas Street west of the M-13 intersections.

The western terminus is at the junction of I-75/US 23 and US 10. As the roadway crosses the I-75/US 23 freeway it feeds into the eastern end of US 10 freeway.

==History==
===Previous designation===
The M-25 designation was first used by July 1, 1919. in the Upper Peninsula. The highway ran from Skandia along what is today M-94 to Munising. From there it used today&#x27;s routing of M-28 eastward to Newberry and Sault Ste. Marie. This designation was replaced by M-28 in 1927.

===Current designation===
In 1933, US 25 was extended north from Port Huron to Port Austin. along M-29. M-25 was designated along the portion of M-29 disconnected by the US 25 extension, from Bay City to Port Austin. M-25 was extended along US 25 to Port Huron when the latter was removed from Michigan in 1973. The southern terminus was placed at I-94 in Marysville, Michigan until it was moved northward to end at BL I-94 (now BL I-69/BL I-94) in 1987.

The section of M-25 in the City of Bay City was named what is now called a Pure Michigan Historic Byway by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). This designation was created on October 23, 1997, for the section of M-25 along Center Avenue between Madison Avenue and the eastern city limits. Originally called the Bay City Historic Heritage Route&quot;, it has been called the Center Avenue Heritage Route by its local stewardship committee.

<doc id="743644" wikidata="Q727723" url="?curid=743644" title="Edgware tube station">
<text>Edgware () is a London Underground station in Edgware, in the London Borough of Barnet, North London. The station is the northern terminus of its branch of the Northern line and the next station towards south is . It is in Travelcard Zone 5.

==Location==

The station is in Station Road, Edgware (part of the A5100). This road runs north-east from the High Street (A5), and the station is about 500 metres from the A5 on the right (south-east) side. The building is set back from the road, and there is a circular service road between the building and the road to allow cars to pull in and pick up or set down.

Just to the right of the station, viewed from Station Road, is a road to the bus station and bus garage.

The Broadwalk Centre can be easily accessed from the station, there is a footpath that leads directly to the Broadwalk carpark and commuter carpark.

==History==

The station was opened on 18 August 1924 as the terminus of the second phase of the Underground Group&#x27;s extension of the Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway from . It was designed by architect Stanley Heaps. There are three platforms, an island lying east of a single platform (platform 1). A trainshed covers the island platforms (2 and 3).

Despite having already had a railway station since 1867 (Edgware station on the London and North Eastern Railway), Edgware was, in 1924, still very much a village in character. The new Underground station was built on the north edge of the village in open fields and, as intended, the new line stimulated rapid suburban expansion along its length. By the end of the decade, what had formerly been fields was quickly being covered with new housing.

The site of the station is very close to the location intended for the unbuilt Watford and Edgware Railway&#x27;s (W&amp;ER&#x27;s) station, which was intended to be built on a branch from the existing single-track LNER branch before the terminus and run through to Watford Junction via Bushey.

===New Works Programme===
In 1935 London Underground announced its New Works Programme. This had major implications for Edgware Underground station and the &quot;Morden-Edgware Line&quot; (as the Northern line was then known):
* A group of LNER lines in north London (the &quot;Northern Heights&quot; lines) including the branch from Finchley to Edgware would be taken over by London Underground and amalgamated with the Morden-Edgware Line.
* The existing Underground line would be extended north-west from Edgware by 5 kilometres to a new terminus at Bushey Heath and a depot at Aldenham. The extension to Bushey Heath involved three new stations (from south-east to north-west):
** 

Much of the land for the railway&#x27;s alignment had originally been bought by the W&amp;ER in the 19th century, but it had not been able to raise the capital to fund the construction and its power&#x27;s had expired in 1911. The Underground Group had bought the W&amp;ER in 1922. The Underground&#x27;s scheme modified the W&amp;ER&#x27;s plan to connect to the LNER branch by starting the extension from the Morden-Edgware Line station instead. The scheme involved the closure of the LNER station 200 metres south of the Underground station and retained the W&amp;ER&#x27;s connection to the LNER&#x27;s single track line from where it passed over the Underground&#x27;s tracks just to the east of the station and into new platforms to be built in the Underground station.

The new link at Edgware and others between LNER and Underground tracks near station and at would have made it theoretically possible to travel south from Edgware to central London via three routes:
* the existing Underground line to Golders Green, and beyond
* the former LNER line to and , then the other branch of the Morden-Edgware Line to Camden Town and beyond
* the former LNER line to Finchley Central, Highgate and then the Northern City Line to 

===Postponement and cancellation===

Works to upgrade the existing LNER lines and construction on the new line to Bushey Heath began in the late 1930s but were halted by the outbreak of the Second World War. Additional platforms were started at Edgware and the LNER station and branch line was closed to passenger traffic in 1939 in preparation for the improvements. On the new extension, some earthworks and tunnelling had been undertaken and some structures had been constructed but no further work was done during the war.

The Metropolitan Green Belt was introduced to limit the outward expansion of London into the surrounding countryside. The area through which the new Bushey Heath extension was routed was designated as green belt meaning that the planned residential developments were prevented and the need for the stations serving them was removed.

Edgware LNER station was never reopened for passengers although freight traffic used the line until the 1960s. The improvements on the branch to Finchley were completed only between Mill Hill East and Finchley Central and only that short section was incorporated into the Northern line (as it had been renamed in the late 1930s). The completion of the plans were formally cancelled in 1950.

===Accident===
On 27 July 1946, an accident occurred at Edgware when the driver (James Lofting) of a northbound train suffered a heart attack while entering the station. The train did not stop within the area of the platform, and struck the buffers at approximately 5 mph. No passengers were seriously injured, but Lofting died as a result of his heart failure before he could be removed from the wreckage. It appeared from the condition of the controls that Lofting had disabled the deadman&#x27;s handle while the train was still moving. The circumstances of this accident were similar to those of the Moorgate tube crash of 1975.

===Modernisation===
During 2008–09, Tube Lines carried out work to modernise the station, including the fitting of lifts to enable step-free platform access, improved CCTV coverage and more help points.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 32, 79, 107, 113, 142, 186, 204, 221, 240, 251, 288, 292, 303, 340, 384 and night routes N5, N16 and N113 and non-London bus routes 614 and 644 serve the station and bus station.

<doc id="743646" wikidata="Q5115295" url="?curid=743646" title="Chubu University">
<text>is a private university in Kasugai, Aichi, Japan.

Chubu University was established as the Chubu Institute of Technology in 1964 with the motto &quot;Acta, non Verba&quot; (Actions, not Words), but its institutional history begins with the Nagoya Daichi High School established in 1938. It was renamed as Chubu University in 1984, and has been subsequently expanded to comprise seven schools and six graduate schools, with about 11,000 students and twenty research institutions.

==Location==
It is located on a hill with full of green trees in City of Kasugai neighboring in the north of City of Nagoya with the population of 2.3 million, the central city of Chubu (meaning Central Japan). There are Japanese major industries such as automobile industry including Toyota and Honda, aerospace industry including Heavy Industries of Mitsubishi and Kawasaki as well as small high skill manufacturers producing one-third of parts of Boeing jets and Mitsubishi Regional Jet, textile industry including Toray producing carbon fiber. Chubu University has strong connections with these big and small industries.

==Sustainability sciences==

Whilst, Chubu University has promoted sustainability sciences including certified as a Regional Center of UNESCO ESD (Education for Sustainable Development), and the connections with NASA in digital earth research, with Club of Rome and United Nations Center for Regional Development in global critical issues, SDGs and quality of life and with JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency) in smart transport and city planning in developing countries.

==Distinguished scholars and their research==

Chancellor Atsuo Iiyoshi, the plasma physicist, was the leader of Japan team in international competition in nuclear fusion method in 80’s and President of National Institute for Fusion Science. President Osamu Ishihara, also plasma physicist, has experienced to teach in US for 25 years and Life fellow of IEEE. Okitsugu Yamashita, Ex President, is an entomologist and received prizes such as Louis Pasteur Prize.

Institute of Science and technology are gathering eminent researchers including Hisashi Yamamoto (Catalyst Chemistry, President of Japan Society of Chemistry, awarded including Japan Academy Prize, Roger Adams Prize), Mitsuo Sawamoto (Molecule Chemistry, awarded including Benjamin Franklin Medal) and Yoshitsugu Hayashi (Sustainable and Well-being City, Full Member of Club of Rome, President of World Conference on Transport Research Society).

Chubu Institute for Advanced Studies has also excellent researchers including Takaho Ando (History of Philosophy, awarded Japan Academy Prize), Hiromichi Fukui (Digital Earth) and Kimitaka Kawamura (Atmospheric Chemistry, awards including Geochemical Society Geochemical Fellow).

Center for Applied Superconductivity and Sustainable Energy Research directed by Sakutaro Yamaguchi has achieved the world top performance in electricity transmission, i.e. 1 million kw by a coil only in 5 cm diameter covered by a 30 cm pipe for cooling at minus 196 degrees in Celsius. This technology will bring a revolution in electricity transmission by replacing huge infrastructure of several 100m high pylons by a pipe in 30 cm diameter. Electric companies in Europe and Asia have much interest in it.

==Visiting Scholars==
Chubu University gathers eminent visiting professors including Kōichirō Matsuura (Emeritus Member of the Club of Rome, former Director-General of UNESCO), Alexander Likhotal (Full Member of Club of Rome, Ex.President of Green Cross International, Spokesman under President Gorbachev of Soviet Union), Timothy Foresman (Principal Researcher for Digital Earth Project under Vice-President Al Gore), etc.

==Outreaching activities to local society==
Outreach activities of the university are extended to local society very actively. A competitive fund was awarded for the revitalization of Kozoji New Town, which was constructed as one of the big new towns built in Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka metropolitan areas in 1970’s and has been recently declining due to the aging of inhabitants. Cultural events such as Chubu University Music Festival, Adult College, and Kids Seminar are popular among the local citizens.

==Sports==
Chubu University is active also in sports, particularly in handball, kendo and baseball, of which teams have been always selected to Japanese university championship. The Handball club became the Champion in 2014. Also, professional baseball players have been produced. It has excellent sports facilities including all-weather 400m x 6 lane track, 4-story budo (kendo, judo) arena, one of the best among Japanese universities.

==International Affiliations==
Chubu University has 44 international affiliations as listed below. Amongst them, 40 years long special cooperation with Ohio University since 1977 is worthy of special mention. PASEO (Preparation for Academic Study in English Overseas) in Chubu University was originally started in 1991 in which lecturers sent by Ohio University are teaching. Student exchange has counted several hundred during 40 years. Yamada House in Ohio University campus was donated by Chubu University and Cupola in Chubu University campus was donated by Ohio University.

<doc id="743649" wikidata="Q173208" url="?curid=743649" title="Ron Dennis">
<text>Sir Ronald Dennis (born 1 June 1947) is a British businessman and motorsport executive. From 1981 to 2009, Dennis served as team principal, CEO and co-owner of McLaren in Formula One, winning seven World Constructors&#x27; Championship titles between and ; he also served as founder, chairman and owner of McLaren Group between 1985 and 2017, where he founded McLaren Automotive in 2010.

Dennis started his career as a mechanic, before starting successful junior formulae teams Rondel Racing and then Project Four Racing, which took over the management of the McLaren team in 1980. Between 1981 and 2009, Dennis was the team principal of the McLaren Formula One team, and was instrumental in transforming the outfit into a regular world championship contender. Constructors&#x27; and drivers&#x27; world championships were won with Niki Lauda, Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna, Mika Häkkinen and Lewis Hamilton.

Dennis founded McLaren Cars—later known as &quot;McLaren Automotive&quot;—in 1985, producing flagship supercars such as the F1 (1992), SLR (2003, in collaboration with Mercedes-Benz) and P1 (2013). Aside from McLaren Group, he is also one of six British business persons to be an official British Business Ambassador for advanced engineering and manufacturing. Dennis is also a main trustee for Tommy&#x27;s, a miscarriage help charity. He is the Global Consultant for the state-owned China Minsheng Investment Group, the chairman for the UK Summit, and also former owner of Absolute Taste. With interests in foreign trade, Dennis also became Chairman of the British East Asian Council in 2014. Before the merger with LVMH, Dennis was a major shareholder in the luxury watch maker TAG Heuer, along with his business partner, Mansour Ojjeh.

==Early life==
Dennis was born and raised in Woking, England, and studied motor vehicle engineering at Guildford Technical College. He began working for the Cooper Formula One team in 1966 as a mechanic at the age of 18 where he worked alongside lead driver Jochen Rindt. In 1968 Rindt moved to Brabham and took Dennis with him. For the 1969 season Rindt moved to Team Lotus; however, Dennis stayed on, choosing instead to work for Sir Jack Brabham.

When Brabham chose retirement in 1971, Dennis and his colleague Neil Trundle decided to start their own team. In 1971, Rondel Racing was founded in Dennis&#x27;s native Woking. Money was at a premium though and Dennis was trying to find sponsorship. Through Ron&#x27;s then girlfriend, who was the daughter of John Phelps, director of Phelps Antique Furniture in Twickenham, one of its regular customers Tony Vlassopulos, a barrister son of a Greek shipowner, was asked to sponsor Rondel.
Vlassopulos asked his friend Ken Grob, chairman of Alexander Howden, insurance brokers in London if he was interested in joining in. Grob said yes on the proviso that his young son Ian Grob could be part of the team, which was agreed. From that moment forward, Vlassopulos became Dennis&#x27; first sponsor.

By the mid-1970s the team was enjoying considerable success in Formula Two. Rondel aspired to be more than a customer team, however, and Dennis soon managed to find an additional backer to Grob and Vlassopulos in Motul, to help fund a Rondel F1 car. For 1974, a Ray Jessop-designed F1 car was planned but the energy crisis affected Motul&#x27;s backing. Ultimately Dennis was unable to obtain sufficient funds to support the F1 venture, so Trundle continued with the Jessop-designed car while Vlassopulos and Grob took over ownership of the team, renamed Token Racing.

Dennis regrouped, forming a Marlboro-backed F2 team for two talented and well-sponsored drivers from Ecuador. In 1975 Dennis founded the Project Three team, and his cars once again became race winners. In 1976 Dennis founded Project Four Racing. This team went on to great success in Formula 2 and Formula 3, winning championships in 1979 and 1980 with Philip Morris (Marlboro) backing. Project Four also participated in the build programme for Procar BMW M1 racing cars. As his business interests became increasingly successful and lucrative, Dennis aspired to return to Formula One, hiring talented designer John Barnard to spearhead the design and development of an innovative new F1 car.

Dennis&#x27;s return to Formula One was well-timed. The recent poor performance of the former world championship-winning McLaren team had prompted Philip Morris executive John Hogan to initiate a takeover of the outfit by Dennis&#x27; Project Four. Effectively a reverse takeover, the team was rebranded as McLaren International with Dennis in control. In addition to hiring Barnard to begin work on the team&#x27;s revolutionary new carbon fibre composite chassis, the MP4/1, Dennis also successfully recruited the Porsche automobile firm to build the cars&#x27; engines from 1984-87.

The &#x27;MP4&#x27; designation originally stood for Marlboro Project Four (the MP4/1 design was complete before the merger). After the change of title sponsor in 1997, the same abbreviation was retained, with the &#x27;M&#x27; now standing for McLaren. The numbering system was retained until 2017 when it was replaced with &#x27;MCL&#x27; following Dennis&#x27; departure.

== Building McLaren ==
=== The 1980s ===
Prior to Dennis&#x27;s arrival at McLaren in September 1980, the team was going through a particularly uncompetitive stint. The team had last won a grand prix with then defending World Champion James Hunt in and had finished a lowly ninth in the constructors&#x27; championship with John Watson and Alain Prost. Even in those early days Dennis recognised the young Frenchman&#x27;s potential but was unable to prevent him moving to the Renault team for , a season that saw McLaren once again winning races. The year also saw many other teams struggling to duplicate Barnard&#x27;s revolutionary carbon-fibre chassis.

In 1981 Dennis and his business partners bought out the other McLaren shareholders, Teddy Mayer and Tyler Alexander. In 1983 Dennis persuaded then-Williams backer Mansour Ojjeh to become a partner in McLaren International. Ojjeh invested in Porsche-built turbocharged engines which carried the name of his company, Techniques d&#x27;Avant Garde (TAG).

Dennis then persuaded the retired Niki Lauda to return to Formula One for the season and at the season opening South African Grand Prix the double World Champion lined up alongside Watson at the start of the season (only after an F1 drivers strike was averted). By the end of the year both drivers had secured two victories and began with more success with Watson&#x27;s win in Long Beach. No more victories followed that year but Lauda debuted the Porsche-powered MP4-1E interim chassis at that season&#x27;s Dutch Grand Prix. By the following race, the Italian Grand Prix, both cars were powered by turbocharged engines: McLaren-Ford had become McLaren-TAG. Convinced by his initial investment, Ojjeh became the major investor in McLaren, taking 60 percent of the shares. By the end of the year, Alain Prost, who had finished second in the 1983 Drivers&#x27; Championship with Renault but was fired after publicly criticising the team following the loss of both the Drivers&#x27; and Constructors Championships, had been signed to replace Watson. With the experienced Lauda at his side, everything was set for a title challenge in .

In just four years Dennis had turned McLaren from an also-ran team into a front-runner and in 1984, with Barnard&#x27;s revolutionary MP4/2 car his work was rewarded with 12 wins from 16 races and both drivers&#x27; and constructors&#x27; titles. Lauda took the drivers&#x27; crown by a half-point from his McLaren teammate Prost, with both drivers scoring more than double the tally of the third-placed Elio de Angelis. While neither Lauda nor Prost were the fastest combination of the year, that title going to reigning World Champion Nelson Piquet in his BMW powered Brabham BT53 who claimed 9 pole positions, the McLaren-TAG&#x27;s reliability was unmatched. As said by Clive James in commentary on the official video review of the Formula One season produced by FOCA: &quot;Anything as fast as the McLarens fell apart, anything as reliable finished later.&quot; The following year the situation was reversed and Prost won his first World Championship while Lauda suffered multiple failures and only won one race. At his home race in Austria Lauda announced his permanent retirement from Formula One at the end of the season. McLaren finished eight points ahead of second placed Ferrari that year but the pack was closing and in , McLaren lost out to Williams, although the consistent Prost won the drivers&#x27; title. Lauda&#x27;s replacement was the 1982 World Champion Keke Rosberg, who also retired from Formula One at the end of the 1986 season.

Dennis signed Stefan Johansson from Ferrari for the season to partner Prost, but it was clear that the TAG engine was no longer competitive in the face of increased manufacturer involvement, and so Dennis approached Honda, who were at the time supplying rivals Williams and Lotus. Williams&#x27; unwillingness to accept a Japanese driver (Satoru Nakajima) in place of Nigel Mansell, as well as their displeasure with Williams team management for losing the 1986 drivers&#x27; title, led Honda to transfer their engine supply to the McLaren team. Dennis made no secret that Johansson&#x27;s seat was only temporary as his intention had been to sign the Brazilian Ayrton Senna (who had developed a close relationship with Honda while at Lotus in 1987) to partner double champion Prost. Senna was under contract with Lotus for 1987 but Dennis got his man and midway through the year it was announced that Senna would be joining the team, along with Honda, for three years from .

In 1988 McLaren was dominant, winning 15 of the 16 races and taking 15 of the 16 pole positions, and both the drivers&#x27; and constructors&#x27; titles with no real opposition. The team won the Constructors Championship with a then-record 199 points, 134 in front of second-placed Ferrari while Senna won his first World Championship by three points from Prost (Senna won 8 races to Prost&#x27;s 7). Dennis had to manage the tension between his drivers. On the second lap of the Portuguese Grand Prix, Senna almost forced Prost into the pit wall at high speed as the Frenchman passed him and took control of the race, Prost going on to win while Senna could only finish sixth. The two had words about the incident after the race.

By mid- it was becoming impossible to pacify the two warring drivers. Following a fall out in the aftermath of a broken promise between them at San Marino where Prost and Senna agreed before the race that whoever got to the first corner in front would not be challenged into that turn. After the restart following Gerhard Berger&#x27;s crash, Senna outbraked Prost going into the Tosa turn and broke the agreement, something which angered Prost. Senna later denied making the agreement but Prost was backed up by Marlboro&#x27;s John Hogan who had been with the drivers when the agreement was made. The result was that the two barely talked for the rest of the season. Prost angered Dennis when not only did he announce that he would be joining Ferrari for , thus ending a highly successful six-year stint with McLaren, but also with his public comments about the team and Honda allegedly favoring Senna at the Italian Grand Prix. Dennis then showed his anger in public after Prost, who won the race following an engine failure for Senna, dropped his winners trophy from the podium to the &quot;Tifosi&quot; showing how unhappy he was despite the win. Dennis flung the Constructors winners trophy at Prost&#x27;s feet and walked off the podium. The &quot;cold war&quot; between the drivers came to a head at the Japanese Grand Prix when, at Honda&#x27;s home track, Prost and Senna had their infamous collision while fighting for the lead late in the race which took Prost out and led to Senna&#x27;s disqualification and gave Prost his third World Championship.

It was Prost&#x27;s actions with the winners trophy in Italy in 1989 that broke Dennis&#x27;s rule that McLaren had ownership of all trophies won by the team and its drivers, with the drivers free to have replicas made of their race-winning trophies for their own collections if they so desired.

=== The 1990s ===
At the start of the 1990s, McLaren continued to dominate the sport with Ayrton Senna taking back-to-back titles in 1990 and 1991. McLaren signed the promising newcomer Mika Häkkinen as a test driver at the end of 1992, but by 1992 Williams was once more in the ascendancy. McLaren was not to win another title for seven years. With the loss of Honda power in 1993, Dennis was left haggling with Ford and Ford&#x27;s works team Benetton for a supply of competitive engines. A disappointing partnership with Peugeot in 1994 failed to yield the expected results and left Dennis searching to find a fourth engine partner in as many years. In October 1994 he agreed terms with Mercedes-Benz to supply engines from 1995 onwards, an association that continued until 2014.

The first couple of seasons the McLaren-Mercedes relationship was difficult, teething troubles with the engine, chassis challenges, and the driver for 1995 was the ageing Nigel Mansell who did not even fit into the car so Mark Blundell deputised. When a revised chassis was produced Mansell&#x27;s performances were not successful. Mika Häkkinen gradually assumed leadership of the team but suffered severe head injuries in a crash at the end of the 1995 season, from which he eventually made a complete recovery.

By the mid-1990s Dennis was once more guiding his team towards domination of the sport, and in 1996 he approached Williams&#x27;s star designer Adrian Newey to become technical director of McLaren. Newey agreed, and in 1998 McLaren took both the drivers&#x27; and the constructors&#x27; titles with Mika Häkkinen. A second drivers&#x27; title followed in 1999, but Ferrari took the constructors&#x27; title.

=== The 2000s ===

In 2000 Dennis was made a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.

In 2001 Jaguar boss Bobby Rahal attempted to lure Newey from McLaren. Details of how Dennis convinced Newey to stay have remained vague but rumours in the specialist motor racing press suggested a deal allowing the designer to work on racing yachts. In the same year, team leader Mika Häkkinen announced that he was to leave the sport. As a result, Dennis signed Kimi Räikkönen.

In 2005 McLaren returned to the top of the sport following a poor year in 2004. Despite producing their strongest performance for several years and winning more grands prix than any of their rivals, McLaren were narrowly beaten in both championships by the Renault F1 team. A further blow was the announcement that Adrian Newey was to join Red Bull Racing from the start of 2006. In December 2005, McLaren announced a title sponsorship deal with Vodafone estimated to be worth £500 million and the signing of World Champion Fernando Alonso, both to begin in 2007. In the interim, McLaren had a difficult 2006 season, failing to win a race for the first time since the 1996 season. Halfway through the 2006 season, McLaren gave up on perfecting their current car and the team focused on the 2007 MP4-22 car.

The start of the 2007 season saw McLaren a strong challenger for the world championships, with both Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton in contention for the drivers&#x27; championship. However, throughout the season the team suffered from the in-fighting between Alonso and Hamilton; Dennis always advocated treating his two drivers equally, however after the Chinese Grand Prix, he said &quot;We weren&#x27;t racing Kimi, we were basically racing Fernando.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; said his comments &quot;made a nonsense of his claims to be treating his drivers equitably in the World Championship run-in&quot; but the team&#x27;s insistence on parity until the very final race in Brazil underlined Dennis&#x27;s core philosophy even if it ultimately lost the team the world championship. The season was also notable for the 2007 Formula One espionage controversy, where the team was judged to have been complicit in the theft and use of Ferrari intellectual property, fined a record $100 million by the FIA, and stripped of all constructor championship points for the season.

=== Final years at McLaren ===
Ron Dennis initially owned all of McLaren after buying out the original shareholders after Bruce McLaren&#x27;s death. In 1983 he offered Mansour Ojjeh the chance to purchase 50% of the team, with McLaren becoming a joint venture with Ojjeh&#x27;s TAG Group. In 2000, after supplying engines to the team through its Mercedes subsidiary for five years, DaimlerChrysler AG (now Mercedes-Benz Group AG) exercised an option to buy 40% of the TAG McLaren Group. Dennis and Ojjeh each retained a 30% share.

In August 2006 it was reported that Daimler was considering acquiring the remaining 60% of the McLaren Group. However, it was announced in January 2007 that the Mumtalakat Holding Company (the sovereign wealth fund of the Kingdom of Bahrain) had purchased 15% each from both Dennis and Ojjeh. In November 2009, Mercedes bought Brawn GP (renaming it Mercedes GP) and announced that McLaren would buy back Daimler&#x27;s 40% share of the group over a period of two years. The shares were divided evenly between the remaining shareholders, with the Mumtalakat Holding Company owning 50% and Dennis and Ojjeh each owning 25%.

Dennis had stepped down as CEO of McLaren in 2009, handing over the reigns to Martin Whitmarsh, but returned to his post in 2014 under the condition that he would seek investment to take a controlling interest in the company. His attempts to do so ultimately failed. BBC Sport reports that Dennis&#x27; relationship with Ojjeh became difficult as early as 2013, culminating in a meeting in October 2016 where Ojjeh discussed Dennis&#x27; exit from McLaren. In November 2016 Dennis lost a court case against his fellow shareholders that saw him suspended from his position as chairman. Dennis&#x27; contract with McLaren expired in January 2017, and in June 2017 it was announced that he had agreed to sell his remaining shares in both the McLaren Technology Group and McLaren Automotive.

==Other businesses==
Dennis has held shares and founded numerous companies other than his major commitment, McLaren Technology Group. In 1998 he co-founded Absolute Taste. Absolute Taste was acquired by One Event Management in December 2016.

Until 2019, Dennis was a business ambassador for the UK Government, working for The Department of International Trade. Dennis also holds the role as Global Adviser for Chinese investment group, Minsheng Investment.

Mansour Ojjeh and TAG Group purchased luxury watchmaker, Heuer, forming the present TAG Heuer. Ojjeh sold a significant stake in the business to Dennis, and both business partners sold the watchmaker in 1999 to LVMH.

In 2007, Dennis founded a charity, &quot;Dreamchasing&quot;, which aims to &quot;help young people achieve their aspirations and, through their successes, to become inspirational role models for others&quot;. His charity&#x27;s first operation was a sponsorship programme for families in Ethiopia, which, supporting the Fida International charity, has assisted over 40 families out of poverty, additionally paying education costs to some.

==Communication style==
&quot;Ronspeak&quot; is the term coined for the style of speech used by Dennis, and has become a well-used phrase in the F1 paddock to describe sentences of unneeded complexity; Dennis is renowned for his verbose, evasive and cautious answers to questions from Formula One journalists. 

While acknowledging that the term has been used to criticise Dennis, the former editor-in-chief of &quot;F1 Racing&quot;, Matt Bishop, argues that &quot;Ronspeak&quot; is not a vice; rather, it is informative and accurate. Dennis, in describing Fernando Alonso&#x27;s contribution to the McLaren team&#x27;s development, said his experience and ability &quot;[prevented] an F1 team from going down [time wasting] technical cul-de-sacs – and as a result, car-developmental progress becomes more linear.&quot; Bishop described this as a prime example of Ronspeak, hailing it as &quot;logical, informative and insightful. [But also] careful ... in that what it doesn&#x27;t do is compare Alonso&#x27;s exceptional all-round ability with that of his predecessors.&quot;

==Personal life==
On 15 February 2008, Dennis announced his separation and later divorce from his wife of 22 years, Lisa, with whom he has three children.

In March 2011, Dennis was banned from driving for six months after accumulation of points.

He is a Conservative Party donor. In the period between 22 April 2005 and 16 June 2011 the Conservative Party accepted £126,200 in donations from Ron Dennis. During the 2015 United Kingdom general election campaign, Dennis was a signatory to a letter to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; which praised the party&#x27;s economic policies and claimed that &quot;a change in course will threaten jobs and deter investment&quot;.

In May 2019, Dennis ranked 304th on the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; with an estimated wealth of £450 million.

<text>Bruno Erhard Abegg (17 January 1803 – 16 December 1848) was a Prussian statesman.

Abegg was born in Elbing (Elbląg) in West Prussia, where his father was a merchant and Privy TradeCouncil.

Beginning in 1822, Abegg studied law at the universities of Heidelberg and Königsberg, and practised in Danzig and Königsberg (now Gdańsk and Kaliningrad, respectively). In 1831, he purchased a manor in Fischhausen (now Primorsk), becoming head of this district on 23 April 1833. He then moved to Königsberg, where he became superintendent of the police. In 1835, he was given the title of Privy Council of the Government in Berlin and sent to Breslau (Wrocław).

He became vice president of the &quot;&quot; (Commission of the Fifty) in Frankfurt. Later, he was a member of the National Assembly in Berlin, where he died of an illness.

Abegg was a cousin of the criminalist Julius Friedrich Heinrich Abegg.

<doc id="743656" wikidata="Q559248" url="?curid=743656" title="Terror of the Autons">
<text>Terror of the Autons is the first serial of the eighth season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. It was broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 2 to 23 January 1971.

The serial is set in various locations in England. In the serial, the alien time traveller the Third Doctor and the organisation UNIT work to stop the Master, a renegade Time Lord just like the Doctor, from using a radio telescope to summon an invasion force of the incorporeal intelligence the Nestenes to Earth. The serial introduced three new characters: the Doctor&#x27;s new companion, Jo Grant; his archenemy the Master; and Captain Mike Yates.

==Plot==

The Master arrives on Earth, steals the Nestene energy unit, then hijacks a radio telescope, using it to channel energy into the Nestene unit, and kidnaps Professor Philips, a research scientist. Reports of the theft and sabotage bring the Doctor, his new assistant Jo Grant and the Brigadier to investigate. There, the Doctor encounters a fellow Time Lord, who warns him that the Master is on Earth.

The Master takes over Farrel Autoplastics, a nearby plastics factory. Jo, investigating the factory, is discovered by the Master, who hypnotises her and wipes her memory of their meeting. He sends her back with a box, ostensibly containing the stolen energy unit; the Doctor realises she has been hypnotised and disposes of the bomb.

UNIT traces the missing Professor to Rossini&#x27;s Circus, which the Doctor visits, but is captured by Rossini; however, he is freed by Jo. The Doctor removes something from the Master&#x27;s TARDIS but is attacked by Rossini and his men; and then &quot;rescued&quot; and attacked by Auton &quot;policemen&quot;. Fleeing, they hide in a nearby quarry until UNIT arrives. As UNIT fights the Autons, the Doctor&#x27;s party escapes. Meanwhile, a large group of Autons, disguised in Carnival masks, are touring the country handing out plastic daffodils; soon deaths from asphyxiation, shock, and heart failure are being reported all across the country.

The Master infiltrates UNIT headquarters disguised as a telephone engineer; at the factory, the Brigadier and the Doctor discover that Farrel, the owner, has chartered a coach, and find a lurking killer Auton, linking the factory and the Master. At UNIT headquarters, the plastic flower and the plastic telephone cable try to kill Jo and the Doctor respectively, but are foiled.

The Master breaks into UNIT HQ; the Doctor reveals that he has possession of the Master&#x27;s dematerialisation circuit, threatening to destroy it: but the Master takes Jo as a hostage. He takes both to the quarry, but Farrel, struggling to break free of his hypnosis, unexpectedly causes a diversion, and the Doctor and Jo escape.

UNIT engages the Autons; and the Doctor convinces the Master that the Nestenes will not distinguish between him and the humans once they arrive. Together, they use the radio telescope channel to force the Nestene energy back into space, and the Autons collapse. The Master flees, then re-emerges, apparently surrendering. When he pulls out a gun, Yates shoots him dead, but the Doctor peels back a facemask to reveal it is the hypnotised Farrel, disguised. The real Master escapes in the coach. However, with his dematerialisation circuit gone, the Master is trapped on Earth.

==Production==
Working titles for this story included &quot;The Spray of Death&quot;. The Autons were brought back because they had been popular in their first appearance the previous year in &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot; (1970).

For the new season, producer Barry Letts and script editor Terrance Dicks wanted to add new characters. They thought about how the Brigadier was like Dr. Watson to the Doctor&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes, and decided to devise a new character, the Master, to emulate Moriarty. The Master was meant to specifically contrast with Pertwee&#x27;s Doctor; the Doctor was authoritative while the Master was charming, though he used that for an evil purpose. &quot;Terror of the Autons&quot; also introduced Katy Manning as Jo Grant (as a replacement for departed companion Liz Shaw), and Richard Franklin as Captain Mike Yates.

The scene at the start of Episode Three, where an Auton is hit by a car and tumbles off a cliff, was quite real. Dinny Powell was driving the vehicle in place of actor Richard Franklin, and stuntman Terry Walsh, playing the Auton, fell further down the slope than intended, being injured in the mishap. He nevertheless got back to his feet in the same take, as planned. Letts requested that a sequence near the story&#x27;s ending, in which Yates yells to the Doctor, &quot;We&#x27;ve got him now!&quot;, be reshot because Franklin&#x27;s performance was too over-the-top. Franklin was grateful for this.

On the first day of filming, Katy Manning injured all the ligaments in her foot when jumping out of a car and running across a quarry. She also formed a fast bond with Barry Letts, as she was fond of the animals used in the serial. Nicholas Courtney was also ill on the first day, so was replaced by a double in those quarry scenes.

===Casting===
Michael Wisher, the young Rex Farrel, had also done uncredited voice work on &quot;Seeds&quot;, and had previously appeared in &quot;The Ambassadors of Death&quot; (as the TV News anchorman) and, later, &quot;Carnival of Monsters&quot; (as the machiavellian politician Kalik). He went on to do various Dalek voices (in &quot;Planet of the Daleks&quot; and &quot;Death to the Daleks&quot;), and became well known as the first actor to play the evil genius Davros in &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot;. His final appearance was as a member of the crew of the Morestran Probe in &quot;Planet of Evil&quot;.

Harry Towb, who plays McDermott, had previously appeared in &quot;The Seeds of Death&quot; (1969). Roy Stewart previously appeared as Toberman in &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot; (1967). Andrew Staines who plays Goodge was a sergeant in &quot;The Enemy of the World&quot; (1968). Christopher Burgess who plays Professor Philips was also in &quot;The Enemy of the World&quot; (1968) playing the role of Swann.

Although credited on-screen, Bill McGuirk does not actually appear; his entire contribution was edited out prior to transmission. He had previously appeared in &quot;The Enemy of the World&quot; (1968).

==Broadcast and reception==

Certain scenes in the serial, particularly the killer doll and the Auton policemen, caused controversy in the press as being too frightening for children. In an unconnected House of Lords debate about the effect of mass media on the public, the serial was cited as an example of a programme that might be too &#x27;scary&#x27; for younger children.

Jon Pertwee would later state that he thought the story was &quot;excellent&quot; and &quot;one of the best we ever did.&quot; Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping simply wrote of the serial in &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), &quot;Functional and memorably scary, but by no means an Auton story.&quot; In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker called it a &quot;strong start&quot; to the season, though they commented that the story was not as effective as &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot; in &quot;depicting the threat of the Autons.&quot; They praised the introduction of the Master, calling him &quot;the most interesting character to have been introduced to the series since the Doctor himself&quot;, though they found it improbable that one comment from the Doctor would persuade him to change his plan. Howe and Walker also praised Letts&#x27; direction, though they found that the over-use of CSO caused some scenes to &quot;look false and strained&quot;.

In 2009, Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; compared the serial to a comic strip and wrote positively about Manning and Delgado. However, he noted that there were &quot;plot holes&quot; and &quot;gaudy early &#x27;70s production values&quot;. Ian Berriman of &quot;SFX&quot;, reviewing the serial for its 2011 DVD release, also commented that Delgado was &quot;note-perfect from the off&quot; and that while the climax was &quot;feeble&quot;, he felt &quot;it&#x27;s all such outrageous fun that it doesn&#x27;t really matter&quot;. DVD Talk reviewer John Sinnott described &quot;Terror of the Autons&quot; as &quot;a wonderful romp,&quot; although &quot;the ending is rushed and pretty much just pulled out of nowhere&quot;. Sinnott particularly praised the Doctor and the Master, as well as the &quot;subtle humor&quot;. &quot;Den of Geek&quot;&#x27;s James Peatly wrote that &quot;Terror of the Autons&quot; was &quot;a fantastically entertaining and incredibly confident slice of macabre fun&quot;. He was positive toward the family tone, Jo, and the Master but felt that it &quot;lacks some of the narrative cohesion&quot; of &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot; and &quot;the Autons are reduced to playing the role of foot soldiers to the Master&quot;. In 2009, &quot;SFX&quot; named the cliffhanger to Episode Two, in which the policeman is revealed to be an Auton, as the 20th scariest moment in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===

A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in May 1975. The cover art by Achilleos depicts what is supposed to be a fully developed Nestene, though this was never actually seen in the serial itself. The novelisation was reissued in 1979 with a new cover by Alan Hood.

The novelisation introduces Jo Grant, although Malcolm Hulke&#x27;s &quot;Colony in Space&quot; novelisation (titled &quot;Doctor Who and The Doomsday Weapon&quot;) had already done so – albeit in contradiction to the television programme. The Master and the Doctor are revealed herein (borrowing from &quot;The Making of Doctor Who&quot; by Malcolm Hulke and Terrance Dicks, published in 1972) to have names that are mathematical formulae, and the grenade the Master uses is identified (again, contrary to the television programme) as Sontaran.

An unabridged reading of the novelisation by actor Geoffrey Beevers was released on CD on 7 July 2010 by BBC Audiobooks.

===Home media===
Although the BBC wiped the serial&#x27;s original 625-line videotapes for reuse, they kept 16mm b/w telerecording film prints. In 1993, these prints were combined with the colour signal from an off-air 525-line NTSC domestic videotape recording, resulting in relatively high-quality colour masters for a VHS release. A short clip from Episode One, depicting the Doctor&#x27;s first meeting with Jo Grant, still survives in its original 625-line format, on a clip reel prepared for a 1973 edition of the news show &quot;Nationwide&quot;. The short Nationwide clip is presented on the DVD of &quot;The Aztecs&quot;, in a featurette discussing the VidFIRE restoration process.

As of 5 August 2008, this serial has been included for sale on iTunes. It was released on DVD in 2011 in a boxset entitled Mannequin Mania with the special edition of &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot;. The &quot;Nationwide&quot; clip is incorporated into Episode one; the rest of the serial consists of restored footage. Comparison between the remastered episodes and clips included in the behind-the-scenes material demonstrate that a great deal of restoration work has been carried out on the picture and sound quality.

The story was released on DVD again in 2013, included in a set paired with &quot;The End of Time&quot; (a two-part Tenth Doctor David Tennant story from 2009/10), in &quot;The Monster Collection&quot; series, specifically &quot;The Master&quot; entry.

This story, along with the rest of Season 8 was released on Blu-ray on 23 February 2021, to coincide with the 50th Anniversary of The Master. It features a new 5.1 sound mix, optional updated special effects, CSO clean up and a brand new restoration of the film prints.

<doc id="743658" wikidata="Q173466" url="?curid=743658" title="David Hobbs (racing driver)">
<text>David Wishart Hobbs (born 9 June 1939) is a British former racing driver. He worked as a commentator from the mid 1970s for CBS until 1996, Speed from 1996 to 2012 and NBC from 2013 to 2017. In 1969 Hobbs was included in the FIA list of graded drivers, a group of 27 drivers who by their achievements were rated the best in the world. Hobbs was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2009.

==Driving career==
Hobbs was born, in Royal Leamington Spa, England, just months before the outbreak of World War II. His career as an international racing driver spanned 30 years at all levels including in sports cars, touring cars, Indy cars, IMSA, Can-Am and Formula One. He has participated in the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Daytona. He made twenty starts in the 24 Hours of Le Mans race, finishing in 8th place at the first attempt in 1962, following with a pole position and a best finish of third (in 1969 and 1984) to his credit.

Hobbs was due to make his F1 Grand Prix debut for Tim Parnell Racing at the 1965 French Grand Prix at Clermont-Ferrand, but a serious road accident put him in hospital for three weeks.

In 1971 Hobbs won the L&amp;M 5000 Continental Championship driving for Carl Hogan out of St. Louis, Missouri, in a McLaren M10B-Chevrolet. He won five of the eight rounds that year at Laguna Seca, Seattle, Road America, Edmonton and Lime Rock. Twelve years later, he would claim the 1983 Trans-Am Series championship as well. He also made two NASCAR Winston Cup starts in 1976, including leading two laps at the 1976 Daytona 500 and drove a race in the 1979 International Race of Champions.

==Television commentator==
Hobbs provided commentary for Formula One and GP2 races (alongside Bob Varsha and former Benetton mechanic Steve Matchett) until 2013, the SCCA Valvoline runoffs, and parts of the 24 Hours of Daytona. He has also worked for CBS on its Daytona 500 coverage, working as both a colour commentator and a feature/pit reporter from 1979 until 1996, and then moved to Speed in 1996 working as a colour commentator and then moved to NBCSN in 2013. He also worked for ESPN, serving as an analyst for their Formula 1 coverage from 1988 until 1992 working with Chris Economaki, John Bisignano and Bob Varsha.

==Other appearances==
Hobbs appeared in the 1983 comedy film &quot;Stroker Ace&quot;, playing a TV race announcer. He also appeared in the &quot;Cars 2&quot; movie, which premiered in June 2011, as announcer &quot;David Hobbscap&quot;, a 1963 Jaguar from Hobbs&#x27; real life hometown in England.

==Personal life==

Hobbs&#x27;s father, Howard Frederick Hobbs, was an Australian-born engineer and inventor who developed an early version of the automatic transmission, known as the Mecha-Matic. Colin Chapman had this transmission fitted to his Lotus Elite racecars. Hobbs lives in Vero Beach, Florida with his wife, Margaret, with whom he has two sons, Gregory and Guy. In 1986, Hobbs opened a car dealership, David Hobbs Honda, in Glendale, Wisconsin, which was sold to the Van Horn Automotive Group in March 2023. His youngest son, Guy, worked for Speed as a pit reporter on their sports car coverage. He is the grandfather of current racing driver Andrew Hobbs.

<text>Whittington Hospital is a district general and teaching hospital of UCL Medical School and Middlesex University School of Health and Social Sciences. Located in Archway, London, London, it is managed by Whittington Health NHS Trust, operating as Whittington Health, an integrated care organisation providing hospital and community health services in the north London boroughs of Islington and Haringey. Its Jenner Building, a former smallpox hospital, is a Grade II listed building.

==History==
The first hospital on the site was St Anthony&#x27;s Chapel and Lazar House, a facility built for lepers in 1473. It closed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the mid-16th century.

The current hospital has its origins in the Small Pox and Vaccination Hospital, built in 1848. It was designed by the architect Samuel Daukes as one of two isolation hospitals in London (the other was the London Fever Hospital in Liverpool Road) intended to care for smallpox patients during the epidemic at that time. The hospital, instituted in 1746, was removed from the original central London site to make way for the building of King’s Cross station.

After smallpox treatment services transferred to Clare Hall Manor at South Mimms in 1896, the hospital was officially re-opened by the Duke and Duchess of York as a workhouse infirmary with the addition of a large adjacent building in 1900. Originally called Highgate Hill Infirmary, in 1914, it became Islington Infirmary and by 1920, five linked blocks had been added to the south of the original building. The hospital was taken over by the London County Council in 1930 and renamed St Mary&#x27;s Hospital.

In 1948, St Mary&#x27;s Hospital (subsequently known as St Mary&#x27;s Wing) amalgamated with Highgate Hospital (subsequently known as Highgate Wing) and Archway Hospital (subsequently known as Archway Wing) to form the Whittington Hospital. The three hospitals had been brought together under the control of the Archway Group Hospital Management Committee on the establishment of the National Health Service in 1946. The combined facility was named after Sir Richard Whittington, an English merchant, who had left a large sum to charitable causes supporting people in need.

In 1977, a new block containing accident and emergency and outpatient facilities was opened by the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board on the St Mary&#x27;s Wing site on Highgate Hill. Further expansion took place in 1983, when the City of London Maternity Hospital was closed and amalgamated with the Obstetric Unit to form the City of London Maternity Unit. The Great Northern Building, containing modern wards and education facilities, was completed in 1992.

In 1998, the Archway Wing was sold to University College London and Middlesex University allowing them to form the Archway campus and, in 2004, the Highgate Wing was chosen by Camden and Islington Community NHS Trust as the site for Highgate Mental Health Centre.

With all clinical activities consolidated on the central St Mary&#x27;s Wing site, a new clinical block and main entrance on Magdala Avenue were procured under the private finance initiative contract. The works, which were undertaken by Jarvis Construction at a cost of £30 million, were completed in 2006.

==Performance==
Following an inspection in December 2015 of the Trust and its services, Whittington Health was rated as Good by the Care Quality Commission in July 2016 – with caring rated as Outstanding. The Trust has a current deficit of £5.9m for the year ending 2016/17 – £200k worse than its planned position.

==Legacy==
A statue commissioned by the Nubian Jak Community Trust, in collaboration with the Whittington Health NHS Trust and Haringey Council, to honour the contributions of Windrush and Commonwealth NHS nurses and midwives, was unveiled outside the hospital in September 2021, in association with the launch of an anthology compiled by Jak Beula, entitled &quot;Nursing a Nation&quot;.

== Notable staff ==
*Edith Cavell (1865 – 1915), British nurse celebrated for treating soldiers from both sides during the First World War and assisting 200 Allied soldiers escape from German-occupied Belgium, for which she was tried and executed. Night superintendent in 1901 at Highgate Hospital, which became the Whittington Hospital. 

*Trevor Clay CBE (1936–1994), General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing from 1982 to 1989, Matron Whittington Hospital, from 1969 to 1970.

<doc id="743660" wikidata="Q712382" url="?curid=743660" title="Liu Sheng, Prince of Zhongshan">
<text>Liu Sheng (; died 113 BC), posthumously known as King/Prince Jing of [[Zhongshan Kingdom (Han dynasty)|Zhongshan]] (), was a king/prince of the Western Han empire of Chinese history. His father was Emperor Jing, and he was the elder brother of Emperor Wu of Han. His mausoleum is one of the most important archaeological sites pertaining to the Western Han imperial family.

==Life==
Liu Sheng was born to Emperor Jing of Han and Consort Jia, who also had another son, Liu Pengzu the Prince of Zhao. He was given the fief of Zhongshan by his father in 154 BC, and therefore reigned in the period right after the Rebellion of the Seven States, when the political atmosphere was one of suspicion regarding the feudal states. Given this atmosphere Liu Sheng was one of the more successful feudal rulers.

In the third year of the reign of Emperor Wu, his younger brother, Liu Sheng and several other princes were invited to Chang&#x27;an to feast; at the feast Liu Sheng wept and complained of the treatment of the feudal princes by centrally appointed officials, who made use of their role as monitors to constantly trump up charges against the princes. Impressed by this petition the Emperor explicitly ordered that the unfair scrutiny of the princes should stop, and Liu Sheng became one of the most renowned of the feudal rulers of his time.

He was known to indulge in alcohol and women, and is reputed to have had some 120 sons.

==Family==

*Father: Emperor Jing of Han (9th son of)
*Mother: Consort Jia
*Wife: Dou Wan
*Children: 
**Liu Chang (劉昌), Prince Ai of Zhongshan (中山哀王)
**Liu Zhen (劉貞), Marquis of Zhuolu Ting (涿鹿亭侯)
*Descendants:
**Liu Bei (161–223)
**Liu Kun (270–318)

== Mausoleum ==
Liu Sheng&#x27;s tomb was discovered in 1968 by Wang Zhongshu at Mancheng in the Hebei Province, west of Beijing. He was buried along with his wife, Dou Wan. It was the first undisturbed Western Han tomb discovered. The two were buried in two caves inside a mountainside. Each cave contained two side rooms for storage, a rear chamber for the coffin, and a large central chamber with a tiled roof and wooden supports that has since collapsed. The tomb contained over 2,700 artifacts. In total, the following objects were excavated:

* 419 bronze artifacts
* 499 iron artifacts
* 21 gold artifacts
* 77 silver artifacts
* 78 jade artifacts
* 70 lacquered artifacts
* 6 chariots (south-facing side room)
* 571 pieces of pottery (north-facing side room)
* Silk fabric

The artifacts included gold and silver acupuncture needles, and decorative iron daggers. Two key items are the bronze incense burner, known as a boshanlu &quot;(&quot;) and Sheng&#x27;s jade burial suit. The &quot;boshanlu&quot; resembles the sacred mountains of the Isles of the Immortals in the Eastern Sea. Han Daoists believed that the mountains were a path to everlasting life. It has a deep hemispherical bowl and an elegant base with classical Chinese intertwining dragons. There are wavy inlaid gold lines in the work, which likely represent the Eastern Sea. Projecting from the jagged peaks are relief figures of humans and animals. The &quot;boshan&quot; is an attribution to both Sheng&#x27;s immense wealth and the skill of Han bronze casting. Both Sheng and his wife were buried with intricated jade suits that each contained over 2,000 pieces of jade.

<doc id="743662" wikidata="Q715991" url="?curid=743662" title="Tony George">
<text>Anton Hulman &quot;Tony&quot; George (born December 30, 1959) is the former Chairman, President, and CEO of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Hulman &amp; Company, serving from 1989 to 2009. He was also formerly on the Board of Directors of both entities. He founded the Indy Racing League and co-owned Vision Racing.

Tony George&#x27;s grandfather, Tony Hulman purchased the Indianapolis Motor Speedway at the end of World War II. George is a former driver, having competed in the 1989 Indy Lights championship, finishing 12th in points and capturing 5 top-tens. His mother (Tony Hulman&#x27;s daughter), Mari Hulman George (1934–2018), formerly served as the speedway&#x27;s Chairman and delivers its famed &quot;(ladies and) gentlemen, start your engines&quot; public address before every Indianapolis 500 from 1997–2015 and the Brickyard 400 from 1997, 1999–2015. He delivered the command for the 2017–2019 Indy 500s.

== Indianapolis Motor Speedway Leadership ==
Tony George became president and CEO of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Corporation after the death of Joe Cloutier in 1989.

During his first few years as Speedway head, he oversaw new projects such as an infield road-circuit, Tower Terrace Suites, pit lane reconstruction (including the addition of a warm-up lane requested by many influential Speedway alumni), and a control tower.

Before George&#x27;s arrival, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (or &quot;the Speedway&quot;) traditionally had only one race: the Indianapolis 500. He changed that with the announcement that a NASCAR race would be held at the Speedway. The Brickyard 400 made its debut on August 6, 1994, with Jeff Gordon taking the checkered flag. Many Indianapolis purists despise stock car racing at the most famous circuit in North American open-wheel lore. Some fans believe the configuration of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, as well as the diamond cutting of the track surface makes it a poor facility for stock car racing, traditionally exhibited on high banked ovals.
In 1998, the IROC series came to the track, to little fanfare, and less success.

Later, George helped bring Formula One back to the U.S. with the United States Grand Prix held at the Speedway in 2000. This project involved building a road course inside the oval. The inaugural event in 2000 set an F1 attendance record. Controversy surrounded the 2005 United States Grand Prix, where only 6 of the 20 cars took the green due to problems with Michelin tires, which likely damaged the reputation of the event and the F1 in general in the American market. Michael Schumacher became the first driver to win five races at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway by winning the 2006 race on July 2. Lewis Hamilton won the 2007 event, which turned out to be the last running. George and Formula 1 boss Bernie Ecclestone could not reach an agreement to continue the US Grand Prix at the Brickyard for 2008 and beyond.

The Speedway hosted its first MotoGP event in 2008. The motorcycles could not safely race through the banked turns at high speed, so a portion of the infield was plowed and paved to provide a bypass to Turn 13 of the original road course.

George resigned on June 30, 2009 as President and CEO of IMS and Hulman &amp; Company claiming it to be so he could focus more time on the Indy Racing League. It has been reported that while George&#x27;s mother Mari Hulman George (who is also chairman of the board) supported him, his sisters (who are the other directors) wanted him out. The board also rejected George&#x27;s request to continue funding Vision Racing. George had spent hundreds of millions of dollars on IRL teams, drivers, entry fees, marketing plans, airplanes, personnel and his own team. However the IRL has been said to be continually losing money, and after the estimated $60 million overhaul of the Speedway to accommodate Formula One in 2000, George&#x27;s sisters, Nancy George, Josie George and Kathi Conforti-George, voiced their concern to their mother over the spending habits of their brother, finally convincing Mari Hulman George to take unchecked power away from him in June 2009.

In January 2010, George resigned from the board of directors. In February 2011, however George again became a director of Hulman &amp; Company when the board was expanded. At a July 2016 NASCAR event at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Tony George was described as Chairman of the Board of Hulman &amp; Company, which owns IMS and the IndyCar Series.

== &quot;The Split&quot; ==
Shortly after being removed from the CART Board of Directors, George announced the creation of the Indy Racing League, which began racing in 1996. He claimed to create the IRL to challenge the already established CART series, and to encourage a more even playing field in open wheel racing. He claimed he wanted a series to run entirely on oval tracks, making it distinct from CART, which raced on road and street courses in addition to short ovals and superspeedways. George angered many CART participants by requiring 25 of the 33 spots in the Indianapolis 500 to be occupied by drivers in the IRL circuit. This meant that CART could not hold the Indianapolis 500 as a points scoring event on their calendar as not enough teams would be allowed to compete and earn points. CART decided to stage their own race on the same day, the U.S. 500 at Michigan International Speedway. Due to the lack of participation from the established CART teams, most of the biggest names did not enter the Indianapolis 500 for several years. Tony George became a figure of derision among some racing fans, and he is blamed for open wheel racing losing fans, sponsors and drivers to NASCAR.

George was successful in increasing the visibility of Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The Indy 500 remains one of the highlights of the IRL race season and maintained a strong attendance. George also attracted NASCAR and Formula One (from 2000 to 2007) to Indianapolis. In 2008, the MotoGP series added the oval circuit to its schedule. However the IndyCar series had trouble drawing fans, plus it lost IndyCar drivers to NASCAR such as Sam Hornish, Dario Franchitti, and Danica Patrick. Despite the absorption of the Champ Car World Series (the successor to CART) to IndyCar series, the merged series is nowhere as popular or commercially successful as CART in the early 1990s.

== IRL ==
(see Indy Racing League) The IRL was founded in 1994 and began racing in 1996 claiming to offer a cost-effective, all-oval alternative to the PPG CART Indycar World Series. The basic beliefs behind the creation of the series were:
*Cost controlled racing
*Driver Safety
*All-oval schedule
*Give a better opportunity for American drivers to succeed in motorsports and compete at the Indianapolis 500, particularly USAC drivers whose numerical representation at the 500 had dwindled.

However, as the series evolved, it moved away from these principles, with more foreign drivers, increased costs and, eventually, racing on road courses and street circuits.

The IRL (&quot;The League&quot;) struggled initially, until CART faced financial turmoil and CART teams began to return to the Indianapolis 500 in 2000. The concern over CART&#x27;s future, financial stability, and the attraction to the sponsorship draw of the Indy 500 saw teams slowly moving over to the IRL from 2001 to 2003.

CART declared bankruptcy in the 2003 off season. George made a bid for certain assets of the company, while a trio of CART owners (Gerald Forsythe, Paul Gentilozzi, and Kevin Kalkhoven), along with Dan Pettit, also made a bid, calling their group the Open Wheel Racing Series (OWRS). George&#x27;s offer was to purchase only select company assets, in an effort to eliminate any series that would rival his Indy Racing League. However, if George&#x27;s bid (which was actually higher than the OWRS bid) had been successful, many vendors that were still owed money by CART would have not been paid. Therefore, a judge ruled that the OWRS group should be the purchaser of CART, which ensured a 25th anniversary season in 2004, running as &quot;Champ Car. Open Wheel Racing Series&quot;. (OWRS) would later change its name to &quot;Champ Car World Series (CCWS) LLC&quot;.

Prior to 2003 the IRL was unable to use the term &quot;IndyCar&quot; since that was licensed to CART. In 1992, The Speedway trademarked the term &quot;IndyCar&quot; which had been widely used by CART in championship branding and promotion. The Speedway then leased the term to CART through 1997. With the inception of the IRL, a lawsuit, and a six-year non-use agreement, formal use of the term disappeared. Widespread confusion ensued with CART still competing at &quot;Indy&quot; branded events in Canada and Australia, and both CART/Champ Car and IRL cars being popularly referred to as &quot;IndyCars&quot;. In 2003 the non-use agreement expired and the IRL was able to adopt the recognized IndyCar moniker once again, thereafter becoming the IRL IndyCar Series.

Road courses entered the IRL schedule in 2005. Adding road courses added significant costs to the increasingly expensive league, because modifications to the chassis and engines (which were initially designed solely for the stresses of oval racing) would be required. This caused much criticism of George, and debate amongst fans, some of whom argued it went against what the IRL was founded. The fans opined that oval racing was more exciting than road and street racing, better represented the heritage of open-wheel, paid homage to the Indianapolis 500, was more cost effective and better allotted American drivers with the opportunity of success in open-wheel racing. The other side of the debate argued it was best for the IRL to adopt more road racing, and become similar to CART, the series that saw American open-wheel racing reach its peak (popularity, manufacturer and sponsor interest) with a diverse schedule, technical package, manufacturer involvement, and large costs. In addition, Champ Car, the successor to CART, had failed at providing as diverse a schedule as in the CART era. Becoming CART-like in its season schedule was suggested as a way to help grow the IRL fan base.

In 2005, George stepped down from his operational duties in the IRL to start his own team, Vision Racing, with his wife Laura George and actor Patrick Dempsey. The team was formed from the remnants of Kelley Racing, which disbanded after the 2004 season. George&#x27;s stepson, Ed Carpenter, began driving for the team in 2005. Vision Racing shut down operations on January 28, 2009 due to a lack of sponsorship.

On February 22, 2008, the IRL and Champ Car World Series signed a deal to unify the two open-wheel American circuits, bringing them under the umbrella of the IRL IndyCar Series. A statement was released by the two sides, saying, &quot;Owners of Champ Car and the Indy Racing League completed an agreement in principle Friday that will unify the sport for 2008.&quot;

Champ Car liquidated its assets and the IRL bought almost all of them, thereby allowing the unification of IndyCar and Champ Car on track for 2008, as well as officially unifying the history of American Championship Car Racing.

Many commentators, such as Gordon Kirby, suggest that George&#x27;s actions at the head of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and in creating the IRL to rival the then-dominant CART led to a sharp decline in popularity of open-wheel racing in the United States as it split the fanbase, and gave a significant boost to the national popularity of NASCAR.

<text>Casualty (stylised as CASUAL+Y since 1997) is a British medical drama series broadcast on BBC One. Created by Jeremy Brock and Paul Unwin, it first aired in the United Kingdom on 6 September 1986. 
The show was originally produced by Geraint Morris and has been a staple of British television ever since. &quot;Casualty&quot; is recognised as the longest-running primetime medical drama series in the world.

Initially, &quot;Casualty&quot; aired during the autumn for its first six series, before increasing to 24 episodes annually by 1992. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the episode count expanded further, and by 2004, the series was running 48 episodes a year, with breaks around Christmas and major events like sporting competitions and the Eurovision Song Contest. In 2020, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on television led to a temporary autumn break, but the series resumed its year-round schedule in the following two years. From 2023, &quot;Casualty&quot; introduced a regular autumn break due to rising production costs, settling on a schedule of 36 episodes per year.

The show is set in the fictional Holby City Hospital, focusing on the staff and patients in the Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) Department. It shared a close connection with its former sister programme, &quot;Holby City&quot;, a spin-off that aired from 1999 until its cancellation in 2022. &quot;HolbyBlue&quot;, a police drama set in the same universe, also spun off from &quot;Casualty&quot; and aired between 2007 and 2008.

==Creation==

In 1984, the controller of BBC1 Michael Grade returned from Hollywood to reinvigorate a faltering Saturday night schedule which was falling behind that of ITV. Head of drama Jonathan Powell was instructed to create a long running drama series to take over from &quot;Juliet Bravo&quot; for an 8pm Saturday night slot.

From there, newcomers to television writing, script editor Jeremy Brock and theatre director Paul Unwin came up with the idea for a medical drama after both had spent time hospitalised and were &#x27;deeply concerned by what they saw&#x27;. 

To research the show, they visited the A&amp;E department at Bristol Royal Infirmary where they met charge nurse Peter Salt. Brock and Unwin were shown around and witnessed a typical shift in the department dealing with a myriad of cases. Salt was then appointed the series medical advisor and became the template for the character Charlie Fairhead. Brock and Unwin then pitched their idea to the BBC in 1985 as a manifesto with the title 
&#x27;In 1948, a dream was born. In 1985, that dream is in tatters.&#x27;

According to writer Susan Wilkins, the show was conceived as a response to the political climate of the Margaret Thatcher era. Unwin, reflecting on its origins, stated that as young socialists, they aimed to create a &quot;television revolution&quot; that would be feminist, anti-racist, pro-NHS, and anti-Conservative.

The first series of &quot;Casualty&quot; was met with controversy and discussed in the House of Commons for its negative portrayal of the NHS and depicting staff drinking on duty due to the pressures of working in A&amp;E. Despite this, many people leapt to the defence of the series for its accuracy, including nurses at a Royal College of Nursing conference where Brock and Unwin appeared to in order to discuss the series.

==Production==
===Location===
&quot;Casualty&quot; and &quot;Holby City&quot; are both set in the fictional Holby City Hospital, located in the fictional county of Wyvern in the southwest of England. From the show&#x27;s inception until Series 26, episode 16, exterior shots of the city were filmed in Bristol, featuring iconic landmarks such as the floating harbour and Clifton Suspension Bridge.

The interior A&amp;E set for the first series was at BBC Television Centre in London, where the set had to be “struck” once filming had finished each night. By Series 2, a permanent interior set was built in a warehouse on Kingsland trading estate in the St. Philip&#x27;s area of Bristol, close to where the exterior shots of the A&amp;E and hospital were filmed.
The set remained at the warehouse for 24 years, until production moved to Cardiff during Series 16 in 2011.

Allen House, part of the Ashley Down Centre campus at City of Bristol College, served as the location for most exterior shots of the hospital&#x27;s A&amp;E entrance from 1986 until 2002. In 2002, a new exterior set was constructed at Lawrence Hill Industrial Park, Bristol.

Episode 16 of Series 26, which depicted a fire destroying the hospital department, was the last episode filmed in Bristol, and the first episode filmed in Cardiff aired on 7 January 2012 as an 80-minute special.

Since 2011, &quot;Casualty&quot; has been produced at Roath Lock Studios in Cardiff with a permanent base housing interior and exterior sets as well as production offices.
Additionally, railway scenes are filmed at various preserved railways, including the West Somerset Railway, Avon Valley Railway, and Barry Tourist Railway. For the premiere of Series 33, filming took place in Bristol and Yate in May 2018.

There have been multiple episodes of &quot;Casualty&quot; taking place partially or entirely abroad, filmed in the following countries:

*Series 14 Episodes 29 &amp; 30 - Australia.
*Series 18 Episode 16 - Sweden as Lapland.
*Series 21 Episodes 1 &amp; 2 - Cambodia.
*Series 29 Episode 32 - Romania.

Although Series 32 Episodes 1 &amp; 2 are set in Northern France, filming for these episodes took place in Cardiff &amp; Fishguard.

===Broadcast===

&quot;Casualty&quot; has predominantly been broadcast on Saturday nights since its inception, although it briefly aired on Fridays from 1988 to 1991.
The first two series featured 15 episodes each, while Series 3 had 10 episodes—one of which was postponed following the death of guest star Roy Kinnear. 
Series 4, 5, and 6 consisted of 12, 13, and 15 episodes, respectively. The Series 6 finale episode, which centered around a plane crash, was postponed due to its proximity to the anniversary of the Lockerbie disaster.

In September 1992, &quot;Casualty&quot; returned to Saturday nights with a series length extended to 24 episodes per year and aired in a pre-watershed slot around 8 pm. The move sparked controversy due to the graphic and controversial storylines, in particular the Series 7 finale &#x27;Boiling Point&#x27; which aired at the later time of 9:30 pm instead of 7:50 pm.

In 1997, the episode count increased to 26 for Series 12, including two 75-minute specials. Subsequent series saw further increases: 28 episodes for Series 13, 30 for Series 14, 36 for Series 15, 40 for Series 16 and 17, and 46 for Series 18. By 2004, &quot;Casualty&quot; had transitioned to an almost year-round format, with 48 episodes per series from Series 19 through 25. This number dropped to 42 for Series 26, attributed to the show&#x27;s production move from Bristol to Cardiff. Series 27 saw an increase to 44 episodes, with Series 28 returning to 48 episodes. From August 2014, episode counts vary, with Series 29 having 46 episodes and 43 episodes for Series 30. Whilst Series 31 and Series 32 returned to 44 episodes.

The 1,000th episode aired on 25 June 2016, followed by a feature-length 30th anniversary episode on 27 August 2016 as the Series 31 premiere. For the Series 31 finale, co-creator Paul Unwin wrote a special episode filmed entirely in one take using a single camera, five boom operators, and 40 microphones.

The episode count increased to 46 for Series 33 before dropping down to 43 episodes for Series 34. Production was temporarily halted during Series 34 on 17 March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with filming resuming in September 2020. When the show returned as Series 35 in January 2021, the episode count reduced to 30 and shortened to 40 minutes instead of the usual 50. Series 36 saw a return to 44 episodes, with a reduction to 43 episodes in Series 37 and 36 episodes in Series 38. Future series will be formed of 36 episodes.

&quot;Casualty&quot; typically airs for 50 minutes between 20:00–22:00 on BBC One, with the schedule sometimes shifting due to special events like the Eurovision Song Contest or sporting events. Unusually, episode 31 of Series 38 aired on BBC Two due to a Euro 2024 group stage match. Occasionally, if an episode is split into two parts, part one airs on the Saturday and part two on the Sunday, as seen with the first 2 episodes of Series 13 and Series 14 among others.

The U&amp;Drama channel shows repeat episodes of &quot;Classic Casualty&quot; and started from the very beginning in May 2023. Former series and episodes are also available on demand after broadcast. 

===Training schemes===
In February 2024, BBC Studios launched two new training schemes for aspiring writers and directors—&quot;The Casualty Directors&#x27; Scheme&quot; and &quot;The Writers&#x27; Studio: Casualty&quot;—based within the &quot;Casualty&quot; production team. These initiatives will give eight successful candidates the opportunity to direct or write an episode of the long-running drama. Executive producer Roxanne Harvey expressed enthusiasm for the launch, highlighting the importance of these training programmes to &quot;sustain the high quality of our iconic drama.&quot;

==Cast and characters==

&quot;Casualty&quot; follows the professional and personal lives of the medical and ancillary staff at Holby City Hospital&#x27;s emergency department. The show features an ensemble cast, which originally included 10 main characters in Series 1. These characters were consultant Ewart Plimmer (Bernard Gallagher), senior house officer Baz Samuels (Julia Watson), charge nurse Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson), staff nurse Clive King (George Harris), state enrolled nurse Megan Roach (Brenda Fricker), student nurse Lisa &quot;Duffy&quot; Duffin (Cathy Shipton), paramedics Sandra Mute and Andrew Ponting (Lisa Bowerman and Robert Pugh), receptionist Susie Mercier (Debbie Roza) and porter Kuba Trzcinski (Christopher Rozycki).

The current regular cast includes clinical lead Siobhan McKenzie (Melanie Hill); consultants Dylan Keogh (William Beck) and Stevie Nash (Elinor Lawless); clinical fellow Rash Masum (Neet Mohan); trainee doctors Tariq Hussein (Manpreet Bachu) and Nicole Piper (Sammy T. Dobson); advanced clinical practitioner Faith Cadogan (Kirsty Mitchell); psychiatric liaison nurse Sophia Peters (Kellie Shirley); nurses Rida Amaan (Sarah Seggari), Cameron Mickelthwaite (Barney Walsh), Jodie Whyte (Anna Chell) and Ngozi Okoye (Adesuwa Oni); operational duty manager Jan Jenning (Di Botcher); paramedics Iain Dean (Michael Stevenson), Teddy Gowan (Milo Clarke) and Jacob Masters (Charles Venn) and trainee paramedic Indie Jankowski (Naomi Wakszlak) also feature prominently.

A survey by &quot;Radio Times&quot; in March 2004 found that &quot;Casualty&quot; has launched the careers of more future stars than any other UK soap or drama series. Actors such as Kate Winslet, Orlando Bloom, Jodie Comer, Minnie Driver, Alfred Molina, Christopher Eccleston, Tom Hiddleston, Ashley Artus, Parminder Nagra, Caryn Edwards, Sadie Frost, Ray Winstone, David Walliams, Jonny Lee Miller, Martin Freeman, Helen Baxendale, Robson Green, and Brenda Fricker made appearances before achieving wider success. Winslet, reflecting on her 1993 appearance, stated that appearing on &quot;Casualty&quot; was almost a rite of passage for British actors and taught her valuable lessons in acting naturally in front of the camera. The series has also included guest roles by more established stars such as Marina Sirtis, Norman Wisdom, Amanda Redman, Anita Dobson, Jenny Seagrove, Rula Lenska, Prunella Scales, Celia Imrie, Toyah Willcox, Maureen Lipman, Frances Barber, Andrew Sachs, Russ Abbot, Stephanie Beacham, Honor Blackman, and Michelle Collins.

==Home releases==
The first three series of &quot;Casualty&quot; were released on DVD (Region 2, UK) by 2 Entertain/Cinema Club, with the third series being released to coincide with the show&#x27;s 20th anniversary celebrations. In Australia, the first series was made available by Umbrella Entertainment. Currently, there are no plans for future DVD releases in either the UK or Australia.

==International broadcast==
Irish viewers can stream &quot;Casualty&quot; on the free RTÉ Player service. In the United States, the series is available on Britbox, a subscription-based streaming service that specializes in British television content.

In New Zealand, the current series of &quot;Casualty&quot; is available to watch on Sky New Zealand channel 207 BBC First and on demand via &quot;Sky Go&quot;.

==Adaptations and related media==
===&quot;Holby City&quot;===

&quot;Holby City&quot; premiered on 12 January 1999 as a spin-off from &quot;Casualty&quot; and is set in the same fictional Holby City Hospital. The series focuses on the lives and careers of the medical staff and patients on the hospital&#x27;s surgical wards, addressing various clinical and ethical dilemmas. Like &quot;Casualty&quot;, the show features an ensemble cast of regular characters, including surgeons, nurses, and ancillary staff, while guest actors play the patients. Over the years, notable guest stars have included Eric Sykes, Phill Jupitus, Michael Jayston, Michele Dotrice, Ronni Ancona, Emma Samms, Lee Ryan, Nikki Sanderson, and Johnny Briggs.

The series was created by Mal Young and Tony McHale, with McHale later becoming the executive producer from 2007 to 2010. He was succeeded by &quot;Casualty&quot;&#x27;s executive producer, Belinda Campbell.

===&quot;Casualty@Holby City&quot;===

Reflecting &quot;Holby City&quot;&#x27;s origins as a spin-off from &quot;Casualty&quot; and the interconnected premises of the two series, the BBC has occasionally aired crossover mini-dramas titled &quot;Casualty@Holby City&quot;, featuring characters from both shows. Mervyn Watson, former executive producer of &quot;Casualty&quot;, explained that the idea for the crossovers stemmed from a casual suggestion made within the BBC&#x27;s comedy department. The concept was embraced by the Controller of Drama, who then commissioned the crossovers with input from both shows&#x27; executive producers.

Filming for &quot;Casualty@Holby City&quot; episodes is typically split between &quot;Casualty&quot;&#x27;s Bristol set and &quot;Holby City&quot;&#x27;s Elstree studios. Notably, a significant portion of the Christmas 2005 crossover was filmed on location in a road tunnel in Caernarfon, Wales. The theme tune for the crossover episodes combines shortened versions of the &quot;Casualty&quot; and &quot;Holby City&quot; themes, a choice criticized by &quot;The&quot; &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; as &quot;basically both theme tunes played at once.&quot;

Before the broadcast of the 2005 Christmas crossover, Watson commented on the future of the crossover episodes, stating that while they couldn&#x27;t guarantee more, they would be willing to continue them as long as there was audience interest. In 2007, &quot;Holby City&quot; producer Diana Kyle noted the logistical challenges of producing crossovers, given the demanding year-round filming schedules for both series. Despite this, the production teams remained enthusiastic about creating further crossovers, with &quot;Casualty&quot; producer Oliver Kent reiterating in 2010 that logistical challenges, rather than a lack of interest, were the primary obstacle to producing these special episodes.

===&quot;HolbyBlue&quot;===

In April 2006, the BBC announced the production of a new spin-off drama from &quot;Casualty&quot;, titled &quot;HolbyBlue&quot;. The series centered on the police service in Holby South and aired on BBC One, with its first series occupying a Tuesday night slot, while &quot;Holby City&quot; returned to its previous Thursday 8:00 pm timeslot. The crossover between the two shows was significant, with long-running &quot;Casualty&quot; character Charlie Fairhead appearing in the first episode of &quot;HolbyBlue&quot;, and a full two-part crossover episode with &quot;Holby City&quot; airing at the start of the show&#x27;s second series. However, on 6 August 2008, the BBC confirmed that &quot;HolbyBlue&quot; had been cancelled after two series.

===&quot;Casualty 1900s&quot;===

In December 2006, the BBC aired &quot;Casualty 1906&quot;, a historical medical drama reflecting life in the &#x27;Receiving Room&#x27; of the Royal London Hospital 100 years prior, before the development of modern A&amp;E departments. Based on historical hospital records and news reports, the drama depicted the medical practices and societal conditions of the time. Following its success, a three-episode miniseries titled &quot;Casualty 1907&quot; was broadcast in 2008. While not a direct spin-off nor set in the same fictional location as &quot;Casualty&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; suggested that the BBC leveraged the popularity of &quot;Casualty&quot; to introduce the historical drama, a sentiment echoed by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. A third series, &quot;Casualty 1908&quot;, featuring Cherie Lunghi, was also commissioned. On 25 March 2009, it was announced that the BBC would produce &quot;Casualty 1909&quot;, a six-part series that aired in June and July 2009.

<text>The Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, commonly abbreviated to the Frari, is a church located in the Campo dei Frari at the heart of the San Polo district of Venice, Italy. It is the largest church in the city and it has the status of a minor basilica. The church is dedicated to the Assumption of Mary.

The imposing edifice is built of brick and is one of the three notable churches in the city that retain most of their Venetian Gothic appearance. In common with many Franciscan churches, the exterior is rather plain, even on the front facade. The exterior features a bell tower that was repaired in the early 2000s for structural problems. 

The interior is notable for many tombs and works of art that accumulated in the centuries after it was built. It contains many very grand wall monuments to distinguished Venetians buried in the church, including a number of Doges. Many of these are important works in the history of Venetian sculpture, including that by Donatello. Paintings in situ include two large and important altarpieces by Titian, the &quot;Assumption of the Virgin&quot; on the high altar and the &quot;Pesaro Madonna&quot; in a chapel. The basilica also contains the only rood screen still in place in a church in Venice, a vestige of the Venetian Gothic architecture that preceded Venetian Renaissance architecture.

== History ==
In 1231, under Doge Jacopo Tiepolo, the city donated land at this site to establish a monastery and church belonging to the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor. This edifice proved too small and a three-nave church was begun in 1250, but not completed until 1338. Work almost immediately began on its much larger replacement, the current church, which took more than a century to build. The new church inverted the original orientation, thus placing the facade so that it faces the plaza and small canal. The work was started under Jacopo Celega, but completed by his son Pier Paolo. The campanile, the second tallest in the city after that of San Marco, was completed in 1396. Under the patronage of Giovanni Corner, the Chapel of San Marco was added in 1420. In 1432-1434, Bishop Vicenza Pietro Miani built the chapel of San Pietro next to the bell-tower. The facade was not completed until 1440. The cornice is surmounted by three statues (1516) by Lorenzo Bregno. The main altar was consecrated in 1469. In 1478, the Pesaro family commissioned a chapel in the apse of the church. On 27 May 1492, the church was consecrated with the name of Santa Maria Gloriosa.

The Frari is a parish church of the Vicariate of San Polo-Santa Croce-Dorsoduro. Other churches of the parish are San Barnaba, San Ludovico Vescovo, Santa Maria del Soccorso, and Santa Margherita. In the sixteenth century, however, devotional life changed significantly; being private, less moral, and contained people from various countries. The congregations enlarged only when a famous preacher was preaching, or a major feast was taking place. All connections had a relationship with the brotherhood involved in the church, as most of the other chapel areas were designed for private groups. This church is notable to hosting funerals and other gatherings for the deceased. Also, in later times, there was some crime and mischief going on with the church. As a result, the Franciscans had been expelled from the church during the nineteenth century, the church was restored to the order in 1922. The bell tower went through a structural intervention from 1904 to the 1990s that helped fix the cracks in the bell tower.

Titian, the most prominent sixteenth-century Venetian painter, is interred in the Frari.

== Architectural Features ==

The church overall is in the Venetian style, as the walls were made of red brick, the beams were decorated on the inside, and details were made of Istrian stone. In common with many Franciscan churches, the exterior is rather plain, even on the front facade.

It also has Roman influence, because the columns in the nave contain large cylindrical shafts. The church also contains six smaller chapels as well as the main chapel, three on each side of the main chapel. The baptistery and sacristy were featured along with two other chapels, making the church a family chapel.

The church overall has a vaulted Gothic rib ceiling, making the interior volume large. The church does not have a central dome, making it unique. The materials used were mostly hard and resonant, from marble and Istrian stone tile floors, to masonry walls, and vaults with brick covered with intonaco.

== Bell tower structural intervention ==
Following the collapse of St. Mark&#x27;s bell tower, cracks started to form on the Frari bell tower in 1904. This led to a structural intervention at the Frari. An investigation of the Frari bell tower began in 1990. With structural problems identified in 2000, the tower was investigated deeply in 2001-2003 using a monitoring system to identify crack patterns. The stress was also measured using flat-jack testing. Overall, the tower was inspected geotecnically in great detail, including the use of standard penetration tests and digging through the bell tower foundation. A structural analysis of the bell tower was then performed, and the forces and loads needed to fix the tower were calculated. After the investigation, several instruments, including a crack-gauge and a strain gauge were used to keep track of the work on the bell tower in real time.

Strengthening interventions were conducted to keep the tower safe and used with a structural-geotechnical monitoring system. The first phase involved using a steel cable connecting one of the columns to the bell tower of the Frari. The second phase involved injecting mortar into the soil so that the soil would be strengthened in order to accommodate the increased stress. The most information derived during the first phase came directly from the bell tower and the precision leveling. The mortar was grouted to determine the velocity of the different intervention phases. At the end, the settlement velocity decreased. The third and final phase of the intervention involved a structural joint between the tower and the church. Although it took six months to execute and resulted in extensive deformations in the tower, it was successful and has prevented damage to the bell tower and parts of the church. Overall, soil-fracture intervention and structural-joint execution both use the direct pendulum. The structural joint contributes to prevention of future cracks when seismic loads occur.

== Choir Screen ==

In 1475, a choir screen was built at the Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari so that during the service, the friars were separated from everyone else. It remains the only choir screen in Venice today. The front of the screen has much Gothic influence, especially from the late Gothic era. Some of the styles on the screen today were in historical Venetian fashion. Some elements have a classical influence, such as the leaves that were formed on the pilasters. The screen had an inscription on the front that was created in addition to the main curtain screen that came from the Romans. The design of the screen had works that influenced from other churches, such as San Zaccaria, Ss. Giovanni E Paolo, and San Michele in Isola.

== Pipe organs ==

=== History ===
The first historical information about organs in the Frari basilica dates back to the fifteenth century. In 1483, a chronicle of the convent refers to the existence of a &quot;perfectum&quot; organ. In service for more than thirty years ranging approximately from 1593 at least until 1629. Girolamo Diruta (1586-1589) and Giovanni Picchi are among the most famous organists of the basilica during that period.

An engraving depicting the choir of the basilica made by Father Vincenzo Coronelli in 1708, shows that the basilica then had two organs on the perimeter wall of the choir that were facing one another and placed sideways on the choir stalls.

The left organ was probably built by Giovan Battista Piaggia in 1732, this instrument could therefore be one of his first works. The activity, known up to now, of this Venetian organ builder extends, in fact, from 1740 to 1760, the organ he built for the Venetian church of San Giovanni Evangelista dates back to that date and has remained almost unchanged; the latter therefore served as a term of comparison to validate the attribution of that of the Frari and, above all, to allow its reconstruction in 1970. In fact, after Gaetano Callido had built the front organ (1795), this instrument was progressively abandoned, so as to reach the early seventies almost completely stripped of the metal rods.

The organ on the right was built by Gaetano Callido in 1795 or 1796. Almost uninterrupted documentation from then until the early decades of the twentieth century provides information confirming that, unlike the other organ in the pair, this instrument was entrusted to qualified organ builders for ordinary maintenance and, from time to time, the organ on the right was restored with substantial respect for its authenticity.

Problems regarding restoration of the two ancient organs was faced in 1969. Following construction of new organ with electropneumatic transmission (1928) by Mascioni, an organ located in the apse close to Titian&#x27;s Assumption, use of the Callido organ decreased so much over time that between 1929 and 1969 there were no maintenance interventions on the original pared organs.

The restoration of the pared organs was unequal. Given the good condition of conservation and integrity of the right organ, an intervention of extraordinary maintenance was all that was needed. While a more radical intervention was needed for the left organ that called for a reconstruction in the strictest sense, since there were seven façade pipes, all the internal mechanics, nine wooden pipes, and a bellows were missing. For this reconstruction all the surviving elements were used and, on the basis of these, also making comparisons with the organ of San Giovanni Evangelista, the measures of the pipes were established.

The restoration made it possible to appreciate again the round and robust sounds of the Callido organ and the transparent and delicate timbre of the Piaggia organ, closer to Renaissance sound models. Eventually, the instruments were tuned in unison, in order to be played together. After more than thirty years, a new revision work was promoted, which was completed in the months of April and May 2004.

Thanks to the availability of two organs placed on two opposing choirs that was typical of a musical style in vogue in Venice in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the practice of the double choir is restored in the basilica of the Frari. It is the last surviving example in Venice - and one of the rare examples in Italy - of two choirs with functioning historical organs.

=== Piaggia organ ===
The organ of the left choir was built by Giovan Battista Piaggia. It features an original integral mechanical transmission, has a single keyboard of 45 notes with a first octave scavezza (C1-C5), and a pedalboard of 13 (C1-E2) with a first octave scavezza, constantly combined with the manual. The exhibition consists of 21 pipes, belonging to the main register and forming a single cusp with side wings and with aligned shield mouths. The phonic arrangement, based on the position of the knob tie rods of the various stops in a column of the register (whose handwritten tags are original), is as follows:
*Main 8 &#x27;
*Octave
*Tenth Fifth
*Tenth Ninth
*Second Vigesima
*Vigesima Sixth
*Vigesima Nona
*Human Voice 
*Twelfth flute
*Handset 
*Double basses 16 &#x27;(always inserted)

===Callido organ===
The organ of the right choir is the pipe organ built by Gaetano Callido. It has an original integral mechanical transmission. It has a single 47-note keyboard with first octave scavezza (C1-D5) and a 17 + 1 pedalboard (C1-G # 2 + Rollante pedal) with first octave scavezza, constantly combined with the manual. The exhibition consists of 21 pipes, belonging to the main register and forming a single cusp with lateral wings and with aligned miter mouths, at the foot of which the tromboncini are housed.

=== Mascioni organ ===
The basilica also housed the Mascioni opus 398 pipe organ, built in 1928. It was placed behind the Assunta altarpiece of the main altar. It was electrically driven, had three keyboards of 61 notes each (C1-C6), and a pedalboard of 30 (C1-F3).

It was the largest organ in Venice, the only one with three manuals from the Cecilian period. It was the only instrument that allowed the performance of concerts with a repertoire that could range from the Romantic to the contemporary period.

Despite the transformation of the transmission from pneumatic to electric, the organ preserved all the pipes (about 2000), the bellows, and the wind chests (with the exception of that of the third manual that was destroyed by high water during the restoration of the Pala Assunta in the 1960s), and the beautiful wooden console table, with its original ivory keys.

In 2018, the organ, fully functional and active in liturgies and concerts, was disassembled to allow the complete restoration of the altarpiece and the frame of the painting of the Assumption, with no idea of where to place it at the end of the restoration of the painting. In 1965 it had already been dismantled to allow the restoration of the altarpiece in a previous intervention, once restored, the organ had been rebuilt in 1977, many parts were destroyed, including the wind chest of the 3rd manual, but many other patios were resumed and reassembled because they were missing, some registers from the same period also made by Mascioni. The patient work was performed by Maestro Alessandro Girotto. The completed organ was inaugurated with a concert by the concert master Sergio De Pieri, then organist of the basilica.

The Mascioni organ now has been donated to the parish church of Santa Maria Ausiliatrice in Lido di Jesolo (Venice) with extensive plans for it to be mounted. Restorations and tampering by the Zanin di Codroipo company that are necessary to adapt the organ for use in a different location, however, will leave the city of Venice without its only romantic-symphonic concert instrument.

<doc id="743680" wikidata="Q221122" url="?curid=743680" title="Atatürk Olympic Stadium">
<text>The Atatürk Olympic Stadium (, ) is a stadium in Istanbul, Turkey. Located in the western district of Başakşehir, it is the largest-capacity stadium in the country. The stadium is named after Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder and first President of the Republic of Turkey. Its construction began in 1999 and was completed in 2002. It was originally built for Turkey&#x27;s bid for the 2008 Olympic Games that were ultimately awarded to Beijing, China. It cost about US$140 million.

With its 77,563 (all-seater) capacity and Olympic size, it was granted the &quot;5-star sports complex&quot; title by the UEFA in 2004, enabling it to host the finals of UEFA events. The 2005 UEFA Champions League Final between Milan and Liverpool was played at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium on 25 May 2005. The stadium is also certified by the IAAF and IOC as a first-class venue for track and field, and has hosted several European athletic competitions. The stadium was originally scheduled to stage its second Champions League final between Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich on 30 May 2020, but following the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe the match was postponed and later rescheduled to August at the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal behind closed doors; the stadium was then set to hold the 2021 final between Manchester City and Chelsea instead, but the match was once again moved to Portugal, this time at the Estádio do Dragão in Porto. The stadium hosted the 2023 UEFA Champions League Final between Manchester City and Inter Milan.

Süper Lig football team Istanbul BB used the venue as their home stadium until they moved to the Başakşehir Fatih Terim Stadium in 2014. Galatasaray played its home games at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium during the 2003–2004 football season because their own venue, the Ali Sami Yen Stadium, was under renovation. Galatasaray eventually returned to Ali Sami Yen for the 2004–2005 season, but played 2006–2007 UEFA Champions League group stage matches at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium. Sivasspor also played some of its Süper Lig home games at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium due to bad weather conditions in their original hometown stadium. Beşiktaş used the arena in the 2013–14 season to play most of their home games, with the reasoning being the same as Galatasaray&#x27;s, while their own stadium, the Vodafone Park, was under construction. Since their promotion to the Süper Lig in 2020, Fatih Karagümrük uses the stadium as its home.

==Design and construction==
Istanbul Atatürk Olympic Stadium was originally conceived for the city&#x27;s 2008 Olympic Games bid.

The stadium&#x27;s two steel roofs (weighing 2,800 t and 1,300 t) were produced by Tekfen&#x27;s Steel Structure Fabrication Plant in Ceyhan, Adana. The west roof, designed in the form of a crescent and principally composed of a 1,000 t main beam called mega-truss, is supported by two reinforced concrete shafts with 196 m span.

With its 134 entrances and 148 exit gates, the Olympic Stadium allows 80,000 spectators to evacuate within 7.5 minutes, in case of an emergency. Two annex fields (for warm up / training purposes) are connected directly to the Olympic Stadium with a tunnel.

The Olympic Stadium&#x27;s technical infrastructure and design ensure optimal visibility from all stands; a homogeneous sound level (102 decibels) with modern speaker systems, and a 1,400 lux illumination covering all areas of the stadium.

A 42,200 m2 commercial center is situated under the west roof, with a front facade length of 450 m and a total of 6 floors (3 floors below ground level.)

==Renovations and events==


===2005 UEFA Champions League Final===
From 2002 to 2005, the stadium had a capacity of 80,597 (all-seater). This was later reduced to 76,092 (all-seater) by removing the seats from where it was not possible to see the entire pitch, prior to the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final, the final match of Europe&#x27;s primary club football competition in the 2004–05 season. The showpiece event (dubbed &quot;The Miracle of Istanbul&quot;) was contested between Liverpool of England and Milan of Italy on 25 May 2005.

=== UEFA Euro 2016 plans ===
The stadium was part of the Turkish UEFA Euro 2016 bid. To meet all requirements of UEFA for being able to organise the championship, the authorities planned to take major reconstruction works on this stadium. It was planned to increase the stadium&#x27;s capacity to over 90,000 spectators and making it to the world&#x27;s largest stadium with every seat under cover. To increase the net and gross capacity to 81,106 and 94,555 respectively, the pitch would have been lowered by 2.15 metres. In order to provide better convenience for the VIP guests and the media, all existing hospitality areas at levels 3 and 4 would have been extended. Furthermore, 12 new boxes were planned to be added to the west stand and 32 to the east stand in order to add to the current number of 36 skyboxes; making a total of 80 skyboxes after the reconstruction.

===2023 UEFA Champions League final===
The 2020 UEFA Champions League Final was scheduled to be played at the stadium on 30 May 2020. However the final was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and later relocated to the Estádio da Luz, Lisbon. It was due to stage the following season&#x27;s final, however this was relocated by UEFA on 13 May 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. On 16 July 2021, UEFA announced that the stadium is scheduled to host the 2023 UEFA Champions League final. On 10 June 2023, the match was played between English side Manchester City and Italian side Inter Milan. Manchester City won the match 1–0 to claim their first ever UEFA Champions League title. 

=== UEFA Euro 2024 plans ===
For the UEFA Euro 2024 bid the Turkish Football Federation planned to rebuild the stadium. The stands would be closer to the pitch, making it a football stadium with a new capacity of 92,208 Because of the removal of the athletics track, Turkey plans a new Olympic stadium near to Bosphorus for prospects for a future Summer Olympics. The rebuild was made by Manchester-based British architecture company AFL Architects. Ultimately, the Euro 2024 tournament would be awarded to Germany instead.

=== UEFA Euro 2032 plans ===
For the UEFA Euro 2032 the Turkish Football Federation planned to renovate the stadium. The stands would be closer to the pitch, making it a football stadium with a new capacity of 72,000 It is expected to be lowered than its current capacity in time for that year as one of the ten Turkish venues in the Italian-Turkish joint bid. Ultimately, the Euro 2032 tournament would be awarded to Turkey along with Italy.

==Concerts==
===U2 360° Tour===
On 6 September 2010, the renowned Irish rock band U2 gave a sold-out concert at the stadium with 54,278 fans in attendance, as a part of their U2 360° Tour, the opening act of which was performed by the group Snow Patrol.

<doc id="743682" wikidata="Q181112" url="?curid=743682" title="Northrop Grumman E-10 MC2A">
<text>The Northrop Grumman E-10 MC2A was planned as a multi-role military aircraft to replace the Boeing 707-based E-3 Sentry and E-8 Joint STARS, the Boeing 747-based E-4B, and the RC-135 Rivet Joint aircraft in US military service. The E-10 was based on the Boeing 767-400ER commercial airplane.

==Development==
In 2003, the Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and Raytheon MC2A team was awarded a $215 million contract for pre-SDD (System Development and Demonstration) development of the aircraft. MC2A is an acronym for Multi-Sensor Command and Control Aircraft. The MC2A was intended to be the ultimate theater-wide combat control center.

While the Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS aircraft was a recent development, it is the last such type based on the 707. Installing the high technology systems envisaged for the MC2A on an increasingly obsolete airframe would not provide the capability required. The availability of powerful and reliable turbofans allowed a twinjet to be considered.

In August 2003, &quot;Air International&quot; reported that the goal of integrating air- and ground-search radars on a single airframe was abandoned. Electronic interference between the active electronically scanned array (AESA) and ground-surveillance radars as well as the power requirements for both systems were cited as the reason. Instead the USAF decided to plan two separate E-10 fleets to be integrated with the proposed space-based radar system, air- and space-based ELINT/SIGINT assets, and space-based IMINT satellites. It would have been the central command authority for all air, land, and sea forces in a combat theater. The E-10 was also considered for use as a command center for unmanned combat air vehicles.

The capability of the MC2A was to be raised incrementally, with each phase known as a &quot;spiral&quot;.
; Spiral 1 : Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP): This version would have provided substantial Joint Cruise Missile Defense (CMD) capability with focused AMTI modes and augment the E-8 Joint STARS in the ground surveillance role.
; Spiral 2 : AWACS Capability: This version would have replaced the E-3. It was expected that the Spiral 2 version would use a variant of the Boeing Wedgetail&#x27;s Multi-role Electronically Scanned Array.
; Spiral 3 : SIGINT Platform: This version was intended to replace a wide range of SIGINT/ELINT aircraft. Beyond conceptual studies and preliminary research, this version was not being actively designed. 

===Scale-back and cancellation===
In January 2006, the Air Force FY07 budget request revealed a reshaping of the E-10 program with the cancellation of the SDD program. Funding was maintained for the development and testing of a single demonstration aircraft, now known as the E-10A Technology Development Program (TDP). The TDP phase would flight test the MP-RTIP Wide-Area Surveillance (WAS) radar, and conduct flight demonstrations of the E-10A&#x27;s Cruise Missile Defense (CMD) Capability. The SDD elimination was designed to be a cost-cutting measure and part of a larger reorganization and redefinition of the Air Force&#x27;s mission including the retirement of the Boeing E-4B and Lockheed F-117A Nighthawk fleets, as well as the elimination of all but 58 Boeing B-52H Stratofortresses.

The E-10 finally disappeared at the end of FY2007 as budget pressures and competing priorities pushed it completely out of the budget. The USAF maintained funding for the MP-RTIP radar and may eventually put the radar on the E-8, or on a new aircraft, possibly the same airframe as the next aerial tanker. The smaller version of the MP-RTIP AESA radar designed to be flown on the Northrop Grumman RQ-4B Global Hawk is being flight tested on the Scaled Composites Proteus aircraft. Boeing had kept the E-10 prototype (767-400ER) at Paine Field in Everett, Washington, until it was sold to Bahrain in January 2009 for conversion into a VIP transport.

<text>2069 Hubble, provisional designation , is a carbonaceous asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, approximately 40 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 29 March 1955, by the Indiana Asteroid Program at Goethe Link Observatory, United States, and named after American astronomer Edwin Hubble.

== Orbit ==

&quot;Hubble&quot; orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.6–3.7 AU once every 5 years and 7 months (2,052 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.19 and an inclination of 9° with respect to the ecliptic. Its first unused observations, , was made at Goethe Link in 1953. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins at NAOJ&#x27;s Mitaka Campus, 8 days prior to its official discovery observation at Goethe Link.

== Physical characteristics==

=== Lightcurve ===

In January 2005, American astronomer Brian Warner obtained a rotational lightcurve of &quot;Hubble&quot; from photometric observations taken at his Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado. Lightcurve analysis showed an unusual tri-modal lightcurve with a rotation period of 32.52 hours and a brightness variation of 0.10 in magnitude. While not being a slow rotator, &quot;Hubble&quot; has a longer than average spin rate, as the vast majority of asteroids rotate between 2.2 and 20 hours once around their axis.

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, &quot;Hubble&quot; measures between 34.53 and 46.92 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo between 0.024 and 0.0538. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; classifies it as a carbonaceous C-type asteroid, derives an albedo of 0.041 and a shorter diameter of 34.44 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 11.4.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named after the famous American astronomer Edwin Hubble (1889–1953). He pioneered in the exploration of the Universe beyond the Milky Way galaxy and established a self-consistent distance scale as far as the 100-inch Hooker Telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory could reach. Hubble&#x27;s law and the discovery of the expanding Universe were his greatest achievements. His classification scheme for galaxies, the Hubble sequence, is still the standard and often called the &quot;Hubble tuning-fork&quot;. Hubble also discovered the minor planet 1373 Cincinnati, his only asteroid discovery. The lunar crater &quot;Hubble&quot; is also named after him. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 20 December 1983 ().

<text>Johann Friedrich Abegg (November 30, 1765 in Roxheim near Kreuznach – December 16, 1840 in Heidelberg) was a German theologian.

He was the brother of many siblings in a family of preachers, and was adopted in 1786 as candidate for the preacher office in the Electorate of the Palatinate. He visited the college in Heidelberg from 1789 to 1794 and also worked as extraordinary professor of philology since 1791. In 1794 he started to practise as priest, first in Boxberg, then in Leimen (1799) and Heidelberg (1808) in the parishes St. Peter and Heiliggeist.

Beginning in 1807 he was member of the Grand-Ducal Higher Clergy Council of Baden. In 1819 he was appointed professor of practical theology at the University of Heidelberg, where he also acquired his doctorate in theology.

Only few written works exist of Abegg, as he always saw his duty more in the application of his studies than in the theory. However, he held an important place in Heidelberg&#x27;s society of the time, being an intimate friend of romantic personalities like Anton Friedrich Justus Thibaut, Friedrich Creuzer, Carl Daub and Friedrich Wilhelm Carl Umbreit.

<text>George Emanuel Lewis (born July 14, 1952) is an American composer, performer, and scholar of experimental music. He has been a member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) since 1971, when he joined the organization at the age of 19. He is renowned for his work as an improvising trombonist and considered a pioneer of computer music, which he began pursuing in the late 1970s; in the 1980s he created Voyager, an improvising software he has used in interactive performances. Lewis&#x27;s many honors include a MacArthur Fellowship, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and the American Book Award received for his book &quot;A Power Stronger Than Itself: The AACM and American Experimental Music&quot;. Lewis is the Edwin H. Case Professor of American Music, Composition &amp; Historical Musicology at Columbia University.

== Early life ==

Lewis was born July 14, 1952, in Chicago, Illinois. Lewis&#x27;s father, George Thomas Lewis, was a postal worker who studied electronics under the GI Bill and had a deep love of jazz music; his mother, Cornelia Griffith Lewis, liked blues, soul, and R&amp;B singers.

Lewis began his education at a public elementary school, but he was one of many Black students who could only attend half-days, allegedly to relieve &quot;overcrowding&quot;; this was widely understood to be an excuse to enforce de facto segregation under superintendent Benjamin Willis, whose policies led to the 1963 Chicago Public Schools boycott. An African American teacher convinced Lewis&#x27;s parents to enroll him at the University of Chicago Laboratory School, where he started classes at age 9. Lewis attended the Lab School from 1961 until his graduation in 1969.

His parents wanted him to learn an instrument as a way to make friends, and Lewis chose the trombone, which was paid for in monthly installments. He played in the school orchestra and concert band, took private lessons from University of Chicago graduate students, and as a teenager joined the school&#x27;s new jazz band, run by jazz historian Frank Tirro (then working on his PhD) and Dean Hey. In the late 1960s, classmate Ray Anderson took Lewis to hear Fred Anderson at an AACM concert, and Lewis first heard the Art Ensemble of Chicago at another concert on his high school campus.

== Education and joining the AACM ==

Lewis was accepted to Yale University in 1969, and at age 17 began his studies in prelaw. He also took music theory classes and met a number of artists in the community, but began to lose interest in school after his sophomore year and decided to take a break.

In 1971, during his time off in Chicago, Lewis heard some musicians practicing together near his parents&#x27; house; he introduced himself, and met Muhal Richard Abrams, John Shenoy Jackson, Steve Galloway, and Pete Cosey. Lewis was invited to check out a show at the Pumpkin Room, but misunderstood the invitation and brought his trombone; they let him play anyway, as part of a group that also included Joseph Jarman, Kalaparusha, and Steve McCall. Lewis worried about his performance, but McCall invited him to play another concert; at rehearsal, he was introduced to Roscoe Mitchell, Malachi Favors, Sabu Toyozumi, Aaron Dodd, and Douglas Ewart. Lewis became more involved with the AACM, and Jackson encouraged him to apply to join the group. After his acceptance, Lewis was voted reading secretary and began taking minutes at weekly meetings. Lewis regularly played late gigs with the Muhal Richard Abrams Big Band during his year off, and in the daytime held a United Steelworkers union job at Illinois Slag and Ballast Company.

Lewis returned to Yale in 1972, just as the university began its Duke Ellington Fellowship Program; artists brought to campus during Lewis&#x27;s remaining years included Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus, Max Roach, Dizzy Gillespie, William Warfield, Papa Jo Jones, Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith, Marion Williams, Tony Williams, and Slam Stewart. Lewis met many more musicians among Yale&#x27;s students, faculty, and others living near New Haven such as Wadada Leo Smith, who began visiting Lewis early in the morning before his classes.

Lewis graduated from Yale in 1974 with a degree in philosophy.

== Career ==
In 1976, Lewis released &quot;Solo Trombone Record&quot; to great acclaim.

Lewis has long been active in creating and performing with interactive computer systems, most notably his software Voyager, which &quot;listens&quot; and reacts to live performers.

Lewis has recorded or performed with Anthony Braxton, Anthony Davis, Bertram Turetzky, Conny Bauer, Count Basie, David Behrman, David Murray, Derek Bailey, Douglas Ewart, Alfred Harth, Evan Parker, Fred Anderson, Frederic Rzewski, Gil Evans, Han Bennink, Irène Schweizer, J. D. Parran, James Newton, Joel Ryan, Joëlle Léandre, John Zorn, Karl E. H. Seigfried, Laurie Anderson, Leroy Jenkins, Marina Rosenfeld, Michel Portal, Misha Mengelberg, Miya Masaoka, Muhal Richard Abrams, Nicole Mitchell, Richard Teitelbaum, Roscoe Mitchell, Sam Rivers, Steve Lacy, and Wadada Leo Smith, as well as Frederic Rzewski and Alvin Curran&#x27;s Musica Elettronica Viva and the Globe Unity Orchestra and the ICP Orchestra (Instant Composer&#x27;s Pool).

In the 1980s, Lewis succeeded Rhys Chatham as the music director of The Kitchen.

From 1988-1990, Lewis collaborated with video artist Don Ritter to create performances of interactive music and interactive video controlled by Lewis&#x27;s improvised trombone.

In 1992, Lewis collaborated with Canadian artist Stan Douglas on the video installation &quot;Hors-champs&quot;, featuring Lewis in an improvisation of Albert Ayler&#x27;s &quot;Spirits Rejoice&quot; with musicians Douglas Ewart, Kent Carter and Oliver Johnson; the installation was featured at documenta 9 in Kassel, Germany.

Since 2004, he has served as Edward H. Case Professor of American Music at Columbia University in New York City. He previously taught at the University of California, San Diego.
Lewis is featured extensively in &quot;Unyazi of the Bushveld&quot; (2005), directed by Aryan Kaganof, a documentary about the first symposium of electronic music held in Africa. Lewis gave an invited keynote lecture and performance at NIME-06, the sixth international conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression, which was held at IRCAM, Paris, in June 2006.

His work &quot;Morning Blues for Yvan&quot; was featured on the compilation album &quot;&quot; (Bridge Records), produced by Mendi + Keith Obadike.

In 2008, Lewis published a book-length history of the AACM titled &quot;A Power Stronger Than Itself: The AACM and American Experimental Music&quot; (University of Chicago Press). Lewis later wrote an opera based on the book, titling it &quot;Afterword: The AACM (as) Opera&quot;; the work premiered at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago in 2015.

In April 2022, the International Contemporary Ensemble announced the appointment of Lewis as its next artistic director, effective April 2022.

== Honors and awards ==

In 2002, Lewis received a MacArthur Fellowship. His many honors also include a Guggenheim Fellowship (2015), a United States Artists Fellowship (2011), the Alpert Award in the Arts (1999), and the American Musicological Society&#x27;s Music in American Culture Award in 2009. He became a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2015, a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy in 2016, and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2018. Lewis has received four honorary degrees: Doctor of Music from the University of Edinburgh in 2015, Doctor of Humane Letters from New College of Florida in 2017, Doctor of Music from Harvard University in 2018, and Doctor of Music from the University of Pennsylvania in 2022.

His monograph &quot;A Power Stronger Than Itself: The AACM and American Experimental Music&quot; received the 2009 American Book Award.

<text>Novovoronezh () is a town in Voronezh Oblast, Russia, located on the left bank of the Don River south of Voronezh. Population: 

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as Novovoronezh Urban Okrug—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, this administrative unit also has urban okrug status.

==Economy==
The Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant is located in the town.

== History ==
Novovoronezh was established along with the start of the future nuclear power plant construction works in 1957. It was then called the urban settlement of Novo-Graessovsky, but renamed its current name later the same year. 

The first unit of 210 MW of the Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant was put into power on September 30, 1964. 

From 1959 to 1963 Novovoronezh was the center of the Novovoronezh district, and its administrative status was upgraded from the urban settlement to a town in 1987.

In 2020, an ambiguous monument was erected in the city to the legendary founder of the city Alyonka, who, according to legend, found a good place and brought her fellow villagers there. Thanks to this monument, Novovoronezh became famous throughout Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. The forged sculptural composition, which cost the city a million rubles and caused negative feedback from citizens, was dismantled three days after installation and later sold at auction for 2.6 million rubles. with a starting price of 1 million rubles. The updated monument to Alyonka, but already made of bronze, was opened on July 1, 2022.

<text>The North Santiam River is a tributary of the Santiam River in western Oregon in the United States. It drains of the Cascade Range on the eastern side of the Willamette Valley east of Salem.

It rises in the high Cascades in eastern Linn county, northwest of Three Fingered Jack in the Willamette National Forest. It flows north through the mountains past Marion Forks, receiving the drainage from the western slope of Mount Jefferson. Near Mount Jefferson it turns sharply west, descending through a canyon past Idanha and Detroit to Niagara County Park where the valley begins to widen and some agriculture use begins. Continuing west, the river flows past Gates, Mill City and Mehama. It emerges through the foothills into the Willamette Valley near Stayton, then flows southwest through the valley where it joins the South Santiam River to form the Santiam River. The confluence is approximately east of the confluence of the Santiam and the Willamette River.

It is impounded by Detroit Dam in the mountains west of Detroit to form Detroit Lake for flood control. Detroit Lake State Park is along the northern shore of the lake.

In the 19th century, the canyon of the North Santiam River provided a formidable obstacle to settlers. The construction of a railroad in 1887 opened up the canyon to settlement and logging of the surrounding mountains.

==Fauna==
Blocked by Big Cliff Dam near Mill City, the lower North Santiam River supports spring chinook salmon and summer steelhead. In the reaches upstream of the dam, the river is managed mainly as a stocked-trout fishery. Near the stream&#x27;s source at Santiam Lake in the Mount Jefferson Wilderness, native cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, and introduced brook trout are also found.

The headwaters of Marion Creek, a tributary of the North Santiam River, originate at Marion Lake, which is a location of many wildlife species. This headwaters area is a breeding location for amphibians including the rough-skinned newt.

==Watershed==
Ten cities draw their drinking water from the North Santiam watershed: Detroit, Gates, Idanha, Jefferson, Lyons, Mehama, Mill City, Salem, Stayton, and Turner.

<text>U.S. Route 23 or U.S. Highway 23 (US 23) is a major north–south United States Numbered Highway between Jacksonville, Florida, and Mackinaw City, Michigan. It is an original 1926 route which originally reached only as far south as Portsmouth, Ohio, and has since been extended. It was formerly part of the major highway known as the Dixie Highway. The highway&#x27;s southern terminus is in Jacksonville, Florida, at US 1/US 17. The northern terminus is at Interstate 75 (I-75) in Mackinaw City, Michigan.

===Florida===
US 23 begins at US 1 (Main Street) at the northern end of downtown Jacksonville, starting as a one-way pair, with the northbound lanes meeting with Florida State College at Jacksonville. It is also unsigned State Road 139 (SR 139) from its southern terminus to its interchange with US 1 in northwestern Jacksonville (SR 139 continues east along SR 10A from the end of US 23 to SR 115). West of I-95, US 23 ends the one-way pair, continuing as Kings Road through northwestern Jacksonville, as an off-grid road. A few miles to the west, US 23 meets with US 1/SR 15 (Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway), becoming concurrent with the highway through the rest of its journey through Florida. The road continues northwest, intersecting with I-295 and eventually makes its way out of Jacksonville. At Callahan, US 1/US 23 meets with US 301, beginning a three-way concurrency as the road continues northward toward the St. Marys River, leaving Florida and entering Georgia.

===Georgia===

In Georgia, US 23 enters from Florida running concurrently with US 1 and US 301 just south of Folkston. Within Homeland, US 301 branches off and US 23 continues northwesterly with US 1 as a divided four-lane highway toward Waycross where it intersects US 82. US 23 splits from US 1 north of Alma and continues to Hazlehurst as a two-lane highway.

In Hazlehurst, US 23 intersects US 221 and begins running concurrently with US 341, a divided four-lane highway designated the Golden Isles Parkway. Continuing into McRae the highway intersects US 280, US 319, and US 441. In Eastman, US 23 leaves US 341 to intersect I-16 near Macon.

US 23 is two lanes from Eastman to the community of Empire, then five lanes with a center turning lane to the Cochran bypass, which is two lanes. In Cochran, US 23 runs concurrently with US 129 Alternate (US 129 Alt.). North of Cochran, it is undivided four lanes for to the junction with State Route 96 (SR 96) in Tarversville, then two lanes for the next to the junction with I-16 near Macon near old Camp Wheeler. North of I-16, US 23, known as Ocmulgee East Boulevard, turns on Emery Highway and then turns onto Spring Street before crossing under I-75 and the Ocmulgee River. After the river, US 23 turns onto Riverside Drive, then parallels the Ocmulgee River and I-75, US 41, and US 80, and leaves US 129 Alt. US 23 then crosses I-75 again and continues to Jackson.

In Henry County, US 23 continues north concurrently with SR 42. US 23 follows Moreland Avenue concurrently with SR 42 in Clayton County and Metro Atlanta, running for several miles in a perfectly straight and due north–south line, which is also the Fulton–DeKalb county line. The highway then turns onto Ponce de Leon Avenue, splitting from SR 42, to follow US 29, US 78, and US 278. Farther along, US 23 turns onto Clairemont Avenue and onto Buford Highway to leave Metro Atlanta. In Buford, US 23 turns right onto SR 20, then onto I-985. The highway intersects US 129 in Gainesville. At the end of I-985, US 23 then continues concurrently with SR 365 north.

US 23 intersects US 123 in Cornelia and begins following US 441. In Clayton, the highway then intersects US 76.

Though US 23 roughly parallels I-75 from Macon to Atlanta, and the two routes come within a few miles in Atlanta, US 23 only intersects with I-75 at the Riverside Drive exit in Macon. It crosses back over I-75 a few miles south. This is the only place that US 23 runs west of I-75 until many miles to the north, in Perrysburg, Ohio, (near Toledo).

===North Carolina===
The highway runs concurrent with US 441 between the Georgia state line and Dillsboro, then with US 74 through Waynesville as the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway, followed by US 19 through Canton and Enka–Candler. West of Asheville, the highway follows I-26 to the Tennessee state line.

===Tennessee===

US 23 runs concurrently with the newly upgraded I-26 from the North Carolina state line past Johnson City and Kingsport. Just west of Kingsport, I-26 stops at the junction with US 11W, and US 23 continues to run north to the Virginia state line.

===Virginia===
US 23 extends for through far Southwest Virginia with the southern point beginning at Weber City and the northern point ending at Pound. It runs concurrent with US 58 and US 421 from Gate City to Duffield. It crosses the Clinch River near Clinchport. From Duffield to Big Stone Gap, it passes through the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests. The entire route is a four-lane divided highway. The stretch of highway is known as The Crooked Road: Virginia&#x27;s Heritage Music Trail and is a symbol of the highway&#x27;s importance to country music.

US 23 passes by the following towns, cities, and counties in Virginia as well: Gate City in Scott County; Norton (an independent city); and Big Stone Gap and Pound in Wise County.

===Kentucky===
US 23 is known as the &quot;Country Music Highway&quot; as it enters Kentucky from Virginia after crossing Pound Gap near Whitesburg. Loretta Lynn, Dwight Yoakam, Billy Ray Cyrus, Patty Loveless, Crystal Gayle, Chris Stapleton, Hylo Brown, and more are all noted along US 23&#x27;s path through Kentucky. US 23 combines with US 119 near Pikeville and continues northward. Just south of Pikeville, it joins US 460 and Kentucky Route 80 (KY 80). It then passes through the Pikeville Cut-Through and US 119 diverges from the route near Coal Run Village. KY 80 splits to the south from US 23 near Prestonsburg, and US 460 splits to the west in Paintsville. US 23 then passes through the outer edge of Louisa and intersects I-64 in Catlettsburg. The highway also begins to run concurrently with US 60 from Catlettsburg to Ashland.

In Ashland, US 23 follows Winchester Avenue and then Greenup Avenue through downtown. Winchester Avenue continues north from 33rd Street as US 23 Business (US 23 Bus.) until rejoining US 23 at 6th Street. From here, US 23 passes the Ashland Town Center Mall and the Melody Mountain shopping district before exiting the city limits. Continuing north near Bellefonte, the highway passes AK Steel&#x27;s Ashland Works then enters Greenup County. It passes several shopping centers and downtown Russell and then briefly enters Flatwoods before entering Raceland along the southern banks of the Ohio River. After passing through the cities of Wurtland, Greenup, and South Shore, the highway crosses the Ohio River at South Portsmouth and enters Ohio at Portsmouth.

Since 1999, the entire Kentucky portion is a four-lane divided highway; in some of the larger cities, there are additional traffic lanes present in both directions. In northeastern Kentucky, from the I-64 junction north into Ohio, some sections are four-lanes undivided, with a double yellow line instead of a median. These are the oldest four-lane sections of US 23 in Kentucky which were upgraded in 1950s and 1960s before divided highways became the design standard. They can be found on US 23 in the cities of Catlettsburg, Ashland, and Russell.

===Ohio===
The majority of US 23 in Ohio is a divided expressway, with the exception of downtown Columbus and the portion of the route between Carey and US 20 east of Perrysburg.

US 23 crosses the Ohio River from Kentucky, enters Portsmouth, and passes through the towns of Lucasville, Piketon, Waverly, Chillicothe, and Circleville, before reaching Columbus. The highway then mostly follows High Street in Columbus, which was the original route. However, it now bypasses the central business district and northern Columbus neighborhoods by following the one-way pairing of 4th Street (northbound) and 3rd/Summit Street (southbound) between the downtown area and Hudson Street, and Indianola Avenue north before returning to its original course on High Street at Morse Road. US 23 then follows High Street northbound from Columbus, going through Worthington, passing the village of Lewis Center, entering Delaware at the Cheshire Road intersection. After US 23 intersects the northern terminus of State Route 315 (SR 315) and passes a retail district, it becomes a limited-access freeway, bypassing downtown Delaware, before resuming as an expressway with at-grade crossings north of the city.

At Waldo, US 23 again becomes a freeway. It continues as a freeway throughout most of Marion County, then resumes at-grade crossings with a mix of some freeway-style junctions which are otherwise signalized after the Morral interchange. US 23 runs concurrently with divided SR 15 until it takes a different route at the Carey exit. SR 15 continues on to Findlay and is designed to allow most traffic to bypass the northern stretch of US 23 by offering a fast connection to I-75. US 23 continues north through Carey, Fostoria, and Risingsun.

West of Woodville, US 23 intersects US 20, where it has an overlap for several miles. US 23 then joins I-75 near Perrysburg, then follows I-475 around the west side of Toledo, passing through Sylvania before entering Michigan. In the portion where I-75 and US 23 overlap, this is a wrong-way concurrency, with southbound I-75 concurrent with northbound US 23, and northbound I-75 concurrent with southbound US 23 in this stretch.

US 23 passes near the birthplace of President Rutherford B. Hayes in Delaware, as well as near the home of President Warren G. Harding in Marion.

===Michigan===
In Southeast Michigan, US 23 serves as a north–south bypass to the west of Metro Detroit. US 23 enters Michigan as a full freeway, sharing a brief concurrency with US 223 until that highway splits west toward Adrian. US 23 continues north to Ann Arbor, where it intersects I-94 and bypasses the city to the east and north, before turning northbound once more. US 23 shares an interchange with I-96 at Brighton before continuing north to the Flint area, where it begins a nearly concurrency with I-75. The combined freeway passes to the west of Flint, sharing an interchange with I-69, before continuing north toward Saginaw and Bay City.

US 23 enters Northern Michigan south of Standish, exiting the I-75 freeway at a trumpet interchange and continuing easterly on a short freeway before intersecting M-13, where US 23 turns northbound along a two-lane road. Beginning here, US 23 follows the shoreline of Lake Huron northerly, passing through cities such as Tawas City, Alpena, and Cheboygan. US 23 ends at a directional interchange with I-75 in Mackinaw City, just south of the approach to the Mackinac Bridge.

==History==

Originally known as the Columbus–Sandusky Turnpike, the road was laid out about 1820. Within four years, it was noted as having frequent use, although it was in poor condition. As a result, on February 10, 1824, James Kilbourne of the Ohio House of Representatives introduced a petition to revise and correct the state road leading from Columbus and Worthington to Delaware, Norton, and further north. Kilbourne believed that the Sandusky Bay was the perfect place for a harbor to open up the Ohio marketplace to New England. He fought relentlessly to establish roads from the capital to Sandusky. He laid out a southern extension of the road to tie Portsmouth on the Ohio River to the central and northern parts of the state. As a result of Kilbourne&#x27;s efforts, the state of Ohio chartered the Columbus and Sandusky Turnpike Company on January 31, 1826. The following year, the federal government gave in trust to the state of Ohio for the turnpike company to finance road improvements and development.

An 1820 map of Ohio shows the turnpike leading from Columbus to Worthington, through Delaware into Marion County. The southern portion of the improved road was built and in use by 1828. The Columbus–Sandusky Turnpike, also sometimes known as Kilbourne Highway, was completed to Sandusky in 1834. Although the Turnpike was much needed and well traveled, the Columbus and Sandusky Turnpike Company did not have the funds to maintain the road. Early maps show the route as &quot;Mud Pike&quot;. Angry at the poor, muddy condition of the road, particularly in the rainiest seasons, travelers occasionally destroyed tollgates. The Columbus and Sandusky Turnpike Company was disbanded February 28, 1843, when the Ohio legislature repealed the act that incorporated it. Two years later, an act was passed that established the road as a public highway.

US 23 was established in 1926 as part of the original U.S. Numbered Highway System. The original route began at US 52 in Portsmouth, Ohio, and followed the old turnpike north to Sandusky, where it continued north to end at US 31 in Mackinaw City, Michigan.

In 1929, US 23 was extended from Portsmouth, Ohio, into Kentucky, ending at Pikeville. The following highways form the original route of US 23:
* Former US 23 Bus. through Pikeville
* KY 1428, Allen to Prestonsburg
* KY 321, Prestonsburg to north of Paintsville
* KY 2565 into Louisa from the south
* KY 3, Louisa to south of Catlettsburg
* KY 3294, Catlettsburg

The southern terminus remained in Pikeville for only two years. In 1930, US 23 was extended to Atlanta.
US 23 was extended into Florida along US 1 in 1951. When the 20th Street Expressway was built around downtown Jacksonville, US 1 was moved but US 23 remained. It has never changed its route in Florida, though, at one time, it was planned to extend south, maybe to Fort Myers via US 17, SR 19, SR 33, US 98, and SR 31.

In the mid- to late 20th century when the coal industry declined in the Appalachian Mountains, US 23 was often dubbed the Hillbilly Highway, and it was said the three &quot;R&#x27;s&quot; of the region were &quot;reading, writing and Route 23&quot;, as workers migrated to northern industrial cities such as Detroit, Cleveland, Columbus, or Chicago. The Dwight Yoakam song &quot;Readin&#x27;, Rightin&#x27;, RT.23&quot; and the Steve Earle song &quot;Hillbilly Highway&quot; in particular reflect this heritage.

In 1985, US 23 was upgraded to Interstate standards on the initiative of Eddie Williams, chief executive officer of economic development for Johnson City, Jonesborough, and Washington County, Tennessee. &quot;The original idea for that project happened in 1985, when two young men [later named as Don Kiel and Alan Bridwell] walked into my office with a plan to upgrade Highway 23 to interstate standards&quot;, Williams said. &quot;And all it cost us was to change the signs.&quot; Later that year, a section of US 23 near Johnson City was designated as I-181, the first section of US 23 to be designated as an Interstate in either Tennessee or North Carolina. Williams claims that this project was a catalyst for the five-state I-26 extension project.
On March 1, 1994, a bill sponsored by State Representative Hubert Collins was passed by the Kentucky General Assembly. This bill allowed US 23 to become known as &quot;The Country Music Highway&quot; in order to recognize all the country music stars that had come from the counties the highway passed through. At every county line, there is a sign that lists the country music star or stars from that county. Also, in the early 2000s, the U.S. 23 Country Music Highway Museum opened in Paintsville to further commemorate these legendary people.

Law enforcement officials from Ohio and Kentucky set up the &quot;US Route 23 Drug Taskforce&quot; in 1996 to patrol the highway for drug trafficking, attempting to halt a major artery of drug networks bringing high-quality cannabis grown in Kentucky north for distribution in Ohio and elsewhere. Lately, it has been primarily used to stop the flow of narcotics from large Ohio cities like Columbus, Dayton, and Cleveland into Portsmouth, all of which have to pass through US 23 to reach Portsmouth. Signs can be spotted along US 23 in Ohio from Portsmouth to Columbus warning traffickers that efforts have been taken to prevent their actions. Some random police stings have been set up at portions of the highway.

During the past few years, the highway has been widened to four or more lanes through its entire length within Kentucky and is one of the more scenic routes in Kentucky. It is six lanes in parts of the city of Pikeville. In 2002, it was officially named a National Scenic Byway.

US 23 also gains attention during college football season as it holds a direct connection between Ann Arbor, Michigan (home of the University of Michigan) and Columbus, Ohio (site of Ohio State University) and the Michigan–Ohio State football rivalry. Each year at the end of November, a convoy of fans travels either north or south depending on where that year&#x27;s game is being held. Unsubstantiated rumors that the host state of that year&#x27;s game has their state police (either the Michigan State Police or Ohio State Highway Patrol) force an increase enforcement of traffic laws along the route in their respective states to cite opposing fans adds to the rivalry.

<doc id="743710" wikidata="Q930317" url="?curid=743710" title="Spiral (Vangelis album)">
<text>Spiral is a studio album by the Greek electronic composer Vangelis, released in December 1977. It was the third album produced by Vangelis in Nemo Studios, London, which was his creative base until the late 1980s. For the track &quot;To the Unknown Man&quot; Vangelis received the Midem International Instrumental award in 1978.

==Overview==
It is a concept album, thematically inspired by ancient Tao philosophy, exploring the nature of the universe moving in spirals. On the front cover is cited Tao Te Ching: &quot;Going on means going far – Going far means returning&quot;, while the sleeve notes state that the track &quot;Dervish D&quot; is &quot;inspired by the Dervish dancer who by his whirling realises the spiralling of the universe&quot;. Vangelis himself designed the cover artwork.

It was a less known and acclaimed album than the two which preceded in the 1970s, &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; (1975) and &quot;Albedo 0.39&quot; (1976).

==Release==
The album reached number 38 on the Dutch album charts in 1978.

In 2011, the album was included, along with &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; and &quot;Albedo 0.39&quot;, in a 3-CD box set series &quot;Original Album Classics&quot; by Sony, RCA and Legacy Recordings. In 2013, the album was released in a remastered and reissued digipak edition by Esoteric Recordings. It includes a bonus track, previously never issued on CD, &quot;To the Unknown Man (II)&quot;, which was released as a B-side of the single &quot;To the Unknown Man&quot; in 1977.

==Instrumentation==
The album is entirely instrumental, apart from Vangelis&#x27; processed vocals on &quot;Ballad&quot;. Vangelis plays synthesisers, sequencers, electric piano, drums and percussion. The Yamaha CS-80 synthesizer is featured for the first time on a Vangelis album; he returned to this synth many times in subsequent albums.

==Reception==
Mike DeGagne of AllMusic noted that the album lacks the &quot;atmospheric&quot; from the previous two albums. He goes on to say that &quot;although the structures and the overall dynamics of the pieces are less complicated and less sophisticated, &quot;Spiral&quot;″s keyboard utilization is still extremely effectual&quot;, and &quot;musical movement does seem to transgress toward full, complete soundscapes&quot;, especially in &quot;To the Unknown Man&quot;. Henri Stirk from Background Magazine rated the 2013 edition by Esoteric Recordings 4/5 stars.

<text>Wilhelm Maria Theodor Ernst Richard Graf von Mirbach-Harff (2 July 1871 – 6 July 1918) was a German diplomat. He was assassinated while ambassador to Moscow.

==Biography==
Born in Bad Ischl in Upper Austria into a Catholic Rhenan aristocratic family, he was a scion of , founder of the Knight academy. His parents were Ernst Graf von Mirbach and his wife Wilhelmine von Thun-Hohenstein (1851–1929).

Mirbach started his diplomatic career in London, where he was Third Secretary at the German Embassy from 1899 til 1902, when he transferred to The Hague. From 1908 to 1911, Mirbach served as the embassy clerk in Saint Petersburg, and then as political councillor for the German military command in Bucharest. In 1915 he became the German ambassador in Greece, before being expelled from Athens in December 1916 when the Entente-leaning government of Eleftherios Venizelos took power.

He participated in the Russian-German negotiations in Brest-Litovsk from December 1917 to March 1918. He was appointed German ambassador to Russia in April 1918.

Mirbach was assassinated at the German embassy in Moscow by Yakov Grigorevich Blumkin and Nikolai Andreyev at the request of the Central Committee of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, who were trying to reignite the war between Russia and Germany. Blumkin entered Mirbach&#x27;s residence in Moscow using forged papers and shot his victim at point blank range. As Mirbach tried to escape, Andreyev fired a second bullet and both of the assassins leapt out of the window and then drove away in a Cheka car. Mirbach&#x27;s assassination signaled the beginning of the revolt of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries in Moscow in 1918.

Mirbach was succeeded as German ambassador to Russia by Karl Helfferich.

Coincidentally, a later relative, Andreas von Mirbach, would be murdered by the Red Army Faction at the West German Embassy siege in Stockholm in 1975.

==Honours==
He received the following orders and decorations:
* Kingdom of Prussia:
** Order of the Red Eagle, 4th class, &quot;1900&quot;

<doc id="743715" wikidata="Q628520" url="?curid=743715" title="Opéra sauvage">
<text>Opéra Sauvage is a soundtrack album by the Greek electronic composer Vangelis, released in 1979. It is the score for the nature documentary of the same title by French filmmaker Frédéric Rossif. It is considered one of Vangelis&#x27; best albums and is his second most successful album in the USA, reaching #42 in the album charts.

==Overview==
Vangelis produced this album during his electro-acoustic period, which was one of the most productive in his musical career. &quot;Opéra Sauvage&quot; is more akin to his classic sound than his earlier nature scores for the same director, Frédéric Rossif, such as &quot;L&#x27;Apocalypse des animaux&quot; and &quot;La Fête sauvage&quot;. A later collaboration with Rossif in the style of &quot;Opéra sauvage&quot; was &quot;Sauvage et Beau&quot;.

&quot;Hymne&quot; was re-recorded in choral version for the 1991 Eureka concert by Vangelis in Rotterdam.

==Release==
The album reached #42 in the Billboard 200, and stayed in the charts for 39 weeks.

==Instrumentation==
Vangelis plays several synthesizers, piano, Fender Rhodes electric piano (featured extensively on &quot;Rêve&quot;), drums, percussion, xylophone, as well as acoustic and bass guitar (&quot;Chromatique&quot;). Jon Anderson is credited with playing harp on &quot;Flamants Roses&quot;.

==Composition==
The album is full of classical-based and warm melodies, orchestrated with Yamaha CS-80 sounds. &quot;Hymne&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Enfant&quot;, &quot;Mouettes&quot; and &quot;Irlande&quot; build on fairly simple themes that are developed instrumentally. &quot;Rêve&quot; is, indeed, as the title suggests, a dreamy calm piece with the hint of jazz in the climax. &quot;Chromatique&quot; has a chromatic instrumental line with chords on an acoustic guitar. &quot;Flamants Roses&quot;, finally, consists of several parts, from slow to upbeat, and finishing off with a bluesy finale; Jon Anderson features prominently on harp.

==Reception==
In the Allmusic review it is described as &quot;rich, electronic orchestrations range from grandly symphonic to simple and serene&quot; and as an &quot;excellent introduction to his music&quot;.

==Track listing==
==Personnel==
* Vangelis – synthesisers and all instruments
* Jon Anderson – harp on &quot;Flamants Roses&quot;

;Production

==Other appearances==
* A documentary on the &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; (1981) special-edition DVD video relates that director Hugh Hudson intended to use the 7/4 piece &quot;L&#x27;Enfant&quot;, which he was particularly fond of, as the opening titles over the first scene on the beach, until Vangelis talked him into letting him compose the iconic &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; theme. The director then had &quot;L&#x27;Enfant&quot; being played in the film by a brass band as source music. A re-recorded version of &quot;Hymne&quot; was used as the score cue for Eric Liddell&#x27;s first race in the Scottish Highlands.
* &quot;L&#x27;Enfant&quot; was included in the soundtrack of the film &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot; (1982) by Peter Weir.
* It was also used as the theme for the 1980 Winter Olympics in USA.
* &quot;Hymne&quot; was the tune of Barilla pasta television advertisements aired in Italy throughout the 1980s. In the US, it was the tune for Ernest &amp; Julio Gallo wine advertisements.
* &quot;L&#x27;enfant&quot; was the main title music of the Hungarian TV program &quot;A Hét&quot; (The Week) in the late 1980s and the early 1990s.
* A sample of &quot;Rêve&quot; was used in the 2002 single &quot;Solarcoaster&quot; by &quot;Solarstone&quot;.

<text>Charles Secretan (January 19, 1815 – January 21, 1895) was a Swiss philosopher. He was born on 19 January 1815 in Lausanne, Switzerland, where he also died on 21 January 1895.

Educated in his native town and later under Friedrich Schelling in Munich, he became a professor of philosophy at Lausanne (1838 to 1846), and later at Neuchâtel. In 1866 he returned to his old position at Lausanne.

In 1837 he founded, and for a time edited the &quot;Revue Suisse&quot;. The object of his writing was to build up a rational, philosophical religion to reconcile the ultimate bases of Christianity with the principles of metaphysical philosophy.

<doc id="743721" wikidata="Q1336967" url="?curid=743721" title="Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate">
<text>The Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate (OMI) is a missionary religious congregation in the Catholic Church. It was founded on January 25, 1816, by Eugène de Mazenod, a French priest later recognized as a Catholic saint. (Oblate means a person dedicated to God or God&#x27;s service.) The congregation was given recognition by Pope Leo XII on February 17, 1826. , the congregation was composed of 3,631 priests and lay brothers usually living in community. Their traditional salutation is (&quot;Praised be Jesus Christ&quot;), to which the response is (&quot;And Mary Immaculate&quot;). Members use the post-nominal letters, &quot;OMI&quot;.

As part of its mission to evangelize the &quot;abandoned poor&quot;, OMI are known for their mission among the Indigenous peoples of Canada, and their historic administration of at least 57 schools within the Canadian Indian residential school system. Some of those schools have been associated with cases of child abuse by Oblate clergy and staff.

==Foundation==

The &quot;Society of Missionaries of Provence&quot; was founded on January 25, 1816, in Aix-en-Provence when Eugene de Mazenod and four companions came together to preach, first with missions in the Provençal dialect, speaking the everyday language of the community.

Born into French nobility in 1782, Eugene de Mazenod fled the French Revolution with his family in 1789. In 1798 in Naples, they were joined by his uncle, the future Bishop . Returning to France in 1802, he entered the Seminary of St. Sulpice and was ordained in 1811.
The character of de Mazenod&#x27;s experience during the French Revolution formed his society&#x27;s goals. Initially established to renew the Roman Catholic Church in France, the society opposed Napoleon&#x27;s view of the Church, and focused its mission on the masses, believed to have abandoned the Church.

On 25 January 1816, Mazenod invited other priests to join him in his life of total oblation to God and to the most abandoned of Provence. Initially called &quot;Missionaries of Provence,&quot; they dedicated themselves to evangelization through preaching parish missions in the poor villages, youth and prison ministry. In 1818 a second community was established at the Marian shrine of Notre Dame du Laus. This became the occasion for the missionaries to become a religious congregation, united through vows and the evangelical counsels. 

On February 17, 1826, Pope Leo XII granted approbation of pontifical right to the congregation of the &quot;Missionary Oblates of the Most Holy and Immaculate Virgin Mary&quot; via papal brief. 

Pope Pius XI (1857–1939) was so impressed by the courage of the Oblates that he referred to them as &quot;specialists in the most difficult missions of the Church.&quot; 

===Charism===
Missionaries first, OMI&#x27;s decree, confirmed in 1982, is that they are &quot;devoted principally to the evangelization of the poor&quot;, and their charism specifically aimed at people &quot;whose condition cries out for salvation&quot;.

We fulfil our task in healing the world by understanding its evolutionary character, by critically engaging its contemporary spirit, and by meeting its new needs in new ways...With Gospel values we dialogue with peoples of different cultures, faiths, and religions, in the search for an integral transformation of society; we work with others to safeguard human dignity, nurture family, foster harmony, promote a culture of peace, and respond to the calls of justice and integrity of creation.

===Rule and constitution===
Eugene de Mazenod&#x27;s initial text of the congregation&#x27;s rule and constitution as approved by the Vatican has been modified both by himself, and subsequent meetings of the General Chapter.

===Religious formation===
Initially, those interested in joining the congregation have several meetings with an OMI priest, usually with visits to an Oblate community. Men aged 18 and over meet regularly to share their experiences of God and what God may be calling them to become, and the congregation shares what it is like to be a member. Potential members are encouraged to regularly attend Mass, read the Bible—especially the Gospel—and pray to discern their vocation.

====Vows====
As members of a religious congregation, Oblates embrace the evangelical counsels, taking three traditional religious vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. Poverty means that all possessions are held in common and that no member may accumulate wealth. Chastity, abstaining from sexual activity, is intended to make the religious totally available for religious service. Additionally, Oblates vow &quot;perseverance until death&quot; as a sign of their commitment to the OMI mission of evangelism.

====Postulancy/pre-novitiate====
This is a 1-2-year experience of living in an OMI community, sharing in many aspects of the life of the congregation. During this time, the postulants participate in the prayer life of a community, share more deeply with others, and become involved in one or more of the congregation&#x27;s apostolates. Essentially, it is an extended period of discernment for the postulants and an opportunity for the congregation to assess the strengths of the candidates and possible areas requiring growth. For those straight out of high school it is possible, in some provinces, to begin working on an undergraduate degree.

====Novitiate====
Next follows the novitiate which is the time for preparing to take the vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. The novices are given the opportunity for longer periods of prayer and spiritual reading as well as silence in order to reflect on the vocation God is offering and nature of their response. The spiritual development of the novice is of particular focus, especially through spiritual direction. During the novitiate, the history and Constitutions of the Congregation are studied in depth. A simple profession is made at the end of the novitiate and the person officially becomes a member of the Congregation.

====Post-novitiate/scholasticate====
After the novitiate, the new members of the congregation continue their studies. In the Philippines this normally involves a 4-year theology degree, followed by a missionary year abroad, although a student may make a request to study at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. The theologate in the United States is takes place in San Antonio, Texas, at Oblate School of Theology. In Canada, studies are undertaken at Saint Paul University in Ottawa, Ontario. Scholastics from four provinces in Southern Africa (Central, Lesotho, Natal, and Northern) study at the congregation&#x27;s scholasticate in the small town of Hilton in KwaZulu-Natal or at the international scholasticate in Rome.

Vows are renewed annually; after three years a member may request final vows. According to canon law, temporary vows may be renewed for a longer period but not exceeding nine years.

===The General Chapter===
OMI conducts a General Chapter, or assembly, of its membership every six years. The assembly may take a month. Held in Rome, the assembly is the highest governing body of the OMI outside of the Holy See, and includes capitular fathers and representatives from OMI provinces worldwide. Called by the Superior General, the assembly determines mission strategy, policies and rules, organizational change, consults on emerging topics, and conducts elections of their administration. Crucially, the assembly also discusses spiritual concerns of their religious formation, community, identity, sets contemplative goals, and affirms its charism.

In October 2016, the General Chapter celebrated OMI&#x27;s 200th year. The assembly focused on its mission and their motto: &quot;Evangelizare pauperibus misit me. Pauperes evangelizantur—He has sent me to bring the Good News to the poor. The poor have received the Good News.&quot; Incumbent Superior General, Louie Lougen was re-elected to his post, as was incumbent Vicar General Paolo Archiati.

====37th General Chapter====
In October 2022, the 37th General Chapter was called. The assembly focused on the theme of &quot;Pilgrims of Hope in Communion.&quot; Luis Ignacio Rois Alonso was elected to the post of Superior General.
==Notable oblates==
Members of the congregation have served in prominent clerical positions, including a number of cardinals, such as Thomas Cooray and Francis George. OMI candidates for sainthood include Józef Cebula, who died in Mauthausen concentration camp, and Joseph Gérard, a missionary to South Africa.

==Locations==

The Oblates are active worldwide. They work in parishes, Catholic schools, retreat centres, and among Indigenous peoples, emphasizing issues of justice and peace.

===Australia===
Begun in 1894, OMI&#x27;s Australian presence is currently administered in one geographic province based in Camberwell, Victoria and includes nine parishes and four schools. As of 2017, there were 42 Oblate priests working in Australia. Australia also administers OMI&#x27;s delegation to China and Hong Kong.

<text>UniSoft Corporation is an American software developer established in 1981, originally focused on the development of Unix ports for various computer architectures. Based in Millbrae, California, it now builds standardization and conformance testing applications for the digital television market.

== History ==
UniSoft was founded on October 5, 1981, in Emeryville, California. Their original business was Unix development, and they were soon recognized as one of the early implementers of Unix for the emerging 16-bit microcomputer market. By 1989, they had completed over 225 Unix implementations on various hardware platforms, which was estimated to have been about 65% of all such ports. UniSoft&#x27;s port of Version 7 Unix was the first operating system for Sun Microsystems&#x27; Sun-1 workstations and servers. It also developed Apple Inc.&#x27;s Unix variant, A/UX, for the Apple Macintosh II. UniSoft UniPlus System V served as the basis of Silicon Graphics&#x27; GL2 operating system, which eventually evolved into IRIX.

In 1991, the company moved to its current offices in Millbrae, California. UniSoft shifted its focus to the television industry in 1997, in order to address standards compliant software in that market. It now works solely in development, testing, and broadcast tools for digital television.

<text>Lake Bodom (; ) is a Finnish lake located in the city of Espoo, not far from Helsinki. The lake measures approximately three kilometres in length and one kilometre in width. It is surrounded by five districts in Espoo: Kunnarla in the west, Röylä in the north, Bodom in the northeast, Högnäs in the southeast, and Karhusuo in the southwest.

The lake is notorious for being the scene of a triple homicide that occurred in the early morning hours of 5 June 1960, when four teenagers (two boys, Nils Gustafsson and Seppo Boisman and two girls, Tuulikki Mäki and Irmeli Björklund) went on a camping trip to the lake and were mysteriously attacked while sleeping in their tent. Three were killed and one survived. In June 2005, the only survivor, Gustafsson, was charged with murdering his friends. On 7 October 2005, the district court found him not guilty of all charges.

The Finnish melodic death metal band Children of Bodom, who are also from Espoo, derive their name from the lake.

<text>Henri Frédéric Amiel (; 27 September 1821 – 11 May 1881) was a Swiss moral philosopher, poet, and critic.

==Biography==
Born in Geneva in 1821, Amiel was descended from a Huguenot family that moved to Switzerland following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.

After losing his parents at an early age, Amiel travelled widely, became intimate with the intellectual leaders of Europe, and made a special study of German philosophy in Berlin. In 1849 he was appointed professor of aesthetics at the academy of Geneva, and in 1854 became professor of moral philosophy.

These appointments, conferred by the democratic party, deprived him of the support of the aristocratic party, whose patronage dominated all the culture of the city. This isolation inspired the one book by which Amiel is still known, the &quot;Journal Intime&quot; (&quot;Private Journal&quot;), which, published after his death, obtained a European reputation. It was translated into English by British writer Mary Augusta Ward at the suggestion of academic Mark Pattison.

Although modest in volume of output, Amiel&#x27;s &quot;Journal&quot; gained a sympathy that the author had failed to obtain in his life. In addition to the &quot;Journal&quot;, he produced several volumes of poetry and wrote studies on Erasmus, Madame de Stael and other writers. His extensive correspondence with Égérie, his muse name for Louise Wyder, was preserved and published in 2004.

He died in Geneva on 11 May 1881, at the age of 59. He was buried at the cemetery of Clarens in the canton of Vaud. The tombstone bears an inscription with a quote from the Epistle to the Galatians 6,8:&quot;CELUI QUI SEME POUR L&#x27;ESPRIT MOISSONERA DE L&#x27;ESPRIT LA VIE ETERNELLE.&quot; (&quot;whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.&quot;)The French philosopher Ludovic Dugas, in trying to describe a new psychological phenomenon, took the word depersonalization from an entry in his &quot;Journal intime&quot;, &quot;Everything is strange to me, I can be outside of my body, of me as an individual, I am depersonalized, detached, away&quot;. Dugas took this as a literal description, but a few paragraphs later Amiel clarifies: &quot;it seems to me that these mental experiences (transformations mentales) are no more than philosophical experiences. I am not committed to any one in particular&quot;.

<text>Charles Whiting (12 August 1952 – 14 March 2019) was Chief Mechanic for the Brabham F1 team and latterly the Formula One race director. He served as the FIA Formula One Race Director, Safety Delegate, Permanent Starter and head of the F1 Technical Department, in which capacities he managed the logistics of each F1 Grand Prix, inspected cars in &quot;parc fermé&quot; before a race, enforced FIA rules, and controlled the lights that start each race.

==Early life==
Whiting was born on 12 August 1952 in Sevenoaks. He watched his first motor race when he climbed over the fence to see the 1964 British Grand Prix, held at Brands Hatch close to his family home. He came to working in motor racing himself through his older brother Nick, who was competing in autocross and circuit racing. Having decided to follow a career in race engineering, he attended a technical college and then the Borough Polytechnic Institute, earning qualifications in mechanical engineering.

==Career==
Whiting&#x27;s first job in motor sport was preparing rally cars. In 1976, he and his brother were running a Surtees in the 1976 British F5000 series for race driver Divina Galica. For the 1977 season Whiting joined Hesketh Racing. Following the demise of the team, he joined Bernie Ecclestone&#x27;s Brabham team, where he would stay for the following decade, becoming chief mechanic for the World Drivers&#x27; Championship successes of Nelson Piquet in and .

In , Whiting became Technical Delegate to Formula One of the sport&#x27;s governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), and in he was appointed FIA Director and Safety Delegate. In this role, he was responsible for track and car safety, the technical and procedural regulations of the sport and for starting the races themselves. He served as lead official at every Formula One race, being in charge of everything related to rules and their interpretation. Whiting also visited future and current venues of Formula One racing to carry out safety inspections.

===2005 United States Grand Prix===

During the United States Grand Prix, Whiting was involved in a controversy caused by Michelin when the company realised the tyres it had brought to Indianapolis were unsafe to use. Michelin offered either tyres with a new specification to replace its seven customer Formula One teams&#x27; equipment or asked Whiting to install a chicane in Turn 13 of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway instead. He refused on the grounds that a new specification would be a breach of the rule or that the chicane would be unfair to Bridgestone who had brought the correct specification and therefore was able to race safely on the existing track. Whiting&#x27;s counter-proposals, which included repeated tyre changes, running through the pits each lap, running at the bottom of Turn 13 or observing a speed limit were all rejected by the Michelin teams. As a result, only six cars took part in the race.

===Safety improvements in motorsport===
Whiting was known for safety improvements in motorsport, such as the halo, which was credited with preventing Charles Leclerc from suffering serious injury at the 2018 Belgian Grand Prix saving Romain Grosjean&#x27;s life at the 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix and also preventing serious injury to Lewis Hamilton at the 2021 Italian Grand Prix after a collision with Max Verstappen.
Zhou Guanyu also credited it for saving his life when his car was trapped between a tyre barrier and a fence at the 2022 British Grand Prix.
Whiting was also responsible for introducing the HANS device, safety survival cell, front and side impact structures and high cockpit sides.

==Death and legacy==
On the morning of 14 March 2019, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, three days before the season opening Australian Grand Prix of the 2019 Formula One season, Whiting suffered a pulmonary embolism and died, aged 66. He left behind his three children from two marriages.

In the hours after his death many F1 drivers and personalities commented that he was instrumental to the success of the sport, being described as &quot;a pillar for the sport&quot;, a &quot;really nice guy&quot; and &quot;a drivers&#x27; man&quot;. In an obituary, journalist Adam Cooper described Whiting as the &quot;perfect man for the difficult role of referee&quot; due to his calm demeanour.

Whiting&#x27;s death was widely mourned in the motorsport world. Moments of silence were held before the starts of the Australian Grand Prix and the 1000 Miles of Sebring in his honour. Valtteri Bottas dedicated his Australian Grand Prix win to Whiting. Jean-Éric Vergne also dedicated his win at the Sanya ePrix to Whiting. He was posthumously named the recipient of the John Bolster Award at the Autosport Awards in December 2019.

At the 2019 British Grand Prix, the FIA decided that his son Justin would act as starter for the race.

<text>The South Santiam River is a tributary of the Santiam River, about long, in western Oregon in the United States. It drains an area of the Cascade Range into the Willamette Valley east of Corvallis.

It rises in the Cascades in southeastern Linn County in the Willamette National Forest at . From this source, the confluence of Sevenmile and Latiwi creeks, it flows briefly north, then generally west through the Western Cascades and Cascadia. It then flows a handful of miles before entering Foster Reservoir. At Foster Reservoir the Middle Santiam River joins the South Santiam. Downstream from the reservoir it flows west past Sweet Home, where it turns northwest, passing through the foothills into the Willamette Valley near Lebanon. It joins the North Santiam River from the southeast to form the Santiam approximately northeast of Lebanon, about east of the confluence of the Santiam with the Willamette River.

U.S. Route 20 follows the valley of the river from near its headwaters in the mountains to the Willamette Valley northwest of Lebanon.

==Tributaries==
Named tributaries from source to mouth are Sevenmile and Latiwi creeks at the headwaters, then Three, Sheep, Elk, Soda Fork, Stewart, and Keith creeks. Then come Boulder, Little Boulder, Trout, Falls, Moose, Canyon, and Wolfe creeks. Further downstream are Dobbin, Soda, Cabin, Bucksnort, Mouse, and Deer creeks.

Below those are Shot Pouch Creek and the Middle Santiam River. Then come Ralston, Gadney, Wiley, Ames, Roaring, McDowell, Hamilton, and Onehorse creeks followed by Spring Branch. Entering the lower reaches of the river are Crabtree, Thomas, and Mill creeks, and the North Santiam River.

<doc id="743756" wikidata="Q1657608" url="?curid=743756" title="Kelly Barnes Dam">
<text>Kelly Barnes Dam was an earthen embankment dam on Toccoa Creek in Stephens County, Georgia, United States, just outside the city of Toccoa. Heavy rainfall caused it to collapse on November 6, 1977, and the resulting flood killed 39 people and caused $2.8 million in damage. The dam was never rebuilt.

A memorial to the dead stands downstream, by Toccoa Falls on the campus of Toccoa Falls College.

== History ==
In 1899, a rock crib dam was built by E. P. Simpson on Tocco Creek to create a reservoir for a small hydroelectric power plant that began operating that same year. The plant, now a historical site on the Toccoa Falls College campus called the Old Toccoa Falls Power Plant, produced 200 kW for the town of Toccoa, Georgia. The power plant was transferred in 1933 to the Toccoa Falls Institute, which decided to develop a more stable electric power source and built an earthen embankment dam over the original rock crib dam between 1939 and 1940. After World War II, the dam was again raised, creating Barnes Lake, a reservoir. The modifications provided power for Toccoa Falls Institute until 1957, when the power production was stopped, and the lake was thereafter used only for recreation.

== Dam characteristics ==

The dam was modified several times, ultimately measuring high, long and wide at its crest. The dam had two uncontrolled earthen spillways. The main spillway was long, wide and located on the left side of the structure. A low point on the right side and away from the dam could also be used as a secondary spillway when the reservoir levels became too high.

The embankment dam was located about upstream from the Toccoa Falls and mostly consisted of residual soils and silt. The dam sat on a foundation of silt and stable biotite gneiss (rock).

Within the dam embankment were two masonry structures. One helped support a pipe that was used as a low-level spillway. The other contained a penstock (pipe) for the hydroelectricity power plant. Neither was being used at the time of the flood.

== Dam failure ==


On November 6, 1977, at 1:30 am, the Kelly Barnes Dam failed after four days of heavy rain: had fallen from November 2 to 5—half of that between 6 pm and midnight on November 5. The rain swelled Barnes Lake, which normally held of water, to an estimated of water.

A total of of the dam failed, causing a peak of maximum discharge to burst downstream.
The flood killed 39 people and destroyed nine houses, 18 house trailers, two college buildings and many motor vehicles. Five houses and five college buildings were also damaged. Two bridges on Toccoa Falls Drive and a culvert at County Farm Road were completely destroyed. The embankments at Georgia State Route 17 were destroyed on either side of the bridge, and one of the bridge abutments at Highview Road was destroyed. The water-supply pipe for the city of Toccoa was damaged and the city&#x27;s water supply was contaminated for several days. The cost of the damage was $2.8 million.

After the flood, Georgia&#x27;s Governor George Busbee called for an immediate investigation, which was carried out by a Federal Investigative Board of the United States Geological Survey. Their report was released December 21, 1977, with no specific causes cited for the failure. The investigators had no engineering plans for the dam and records of construction on the dam were based on witnesses, pictures, and newspaper articles.

The investigation did, however, cite several possible or probable causes. The failure of the dam&#x27;s slope may have contributed to weakness in the structure, particularly in the heavy rain. A collapse of the low-level spillway could have also exacerbated this problem. A 1973 photo showed a , slide had occurred on the downstream face of the dam, which may have also contributed or foreshadowed the dam failure. Overall, the dam itself was in poor condition and lacked a sufficient design.

<doc id="743757" wikidata="Q1051805" url="?curid=743757" title="Cavaquinho">
<text>The cavaquinho (pronounced in Portuguese) is a small Portuguese string instrument in the European guitar family, with four wires or gut strings.

A cavaquinho player is called a &quot;cavaquista&quot;.

==Tuning==
A common tuning in Portugal is C G A D (reentrant with C being the lowest pitch, or from lower to higher pitches).

The standard tuning in Brazil is D G B D.

Other tunings include:
* D A B E – &quot;Portuguese ancient&quot; tuning, made popular by Júlio Pereira, reentrant with A being the lowest pitch
* G G B D
* A A C E
* D G B E – used for solo parts in Brazil
* G D A E – mandolin tuning
* G C E A – ‘&quot;cavacolele&quot;’ tuning, the same as the soprano/tenor ukulele
* D G B E – the same as the highest four strings in standard guitar tuning, often used by guitarists, and the same tuning used for the baritone ukulele

==Forms==
There are several forms of cavaquinho used in different regions and for different styles of music. Separate varieties are named for Portugal, Braga (&quot;braguinha&quot;), Minho (&quot;minhoto&quot;), Lisbon, Madeira, Brazil, and Cape Verde; other forms are the &quot;braguinha&quot;, ‘&quot;cavacolele&quot;’, cavaco, machete, and ukulele.

===Machete and braguinha===

The machete is a variety of the cavaquinho from Madeira. It is a predecessor of the modern ukulele. The &quot;Machete de Braga&quot; (“Braga-style machete”) is called a &quot;braguinha&quot;.

===Minhoto===
The minhoto cavaquinho, associated with the Minho region in Portugal is similar to the &quot;viola braguesa&quot;. Its neck is on the same level as the body. Like the braguesa, the minhoto&#x27;s sound hole was traditionally shaped like a stylized ray (fish); the shape is called “&quot;raia&quot;” in Portuguese.

==International use==
Different forms of cavaquinho have been adapted in different regions. Varieties used outside of Iberia are found in Brazil, Cape-Verde, and Madeira. The locally iconic Caribbean region cuatro family and the Hawaiian ukuleles were both adapted from the cavaquinho.

===Brazil===

The Brazilian cavaquinho is slightly larger than the Portuguese cavaquinho, resembling a small classical guitar. Its neck is raised above the level of the sound box, and the sound hole is usually round, like cavaquinhos from Lisbon and Madeira.
The cavaquinho is a very important instrument in Brazilian samba and choro music. It is played with a pick, with sophisticated percussive strumming beats that connect the rhythm and harmony by playing the rhythm “comping”. Some of the most important players and composers of the Brazilian instrument are Waldir Azevedo, Paulinho da Viola, and Mauro Diniz.

===Cape Verde===

In Cape Verde the cavaquinho was introduced in the 1930s from Brazil. The present-day Cape-Verdean cavaquinho is very similar to the Brazilian one in dimensions and tuning. It is generally used as a rhythmic instrument in Cape-Verdean music genres (such as &quot;morna&quot;, &quot;coladeira&quot;, mazurka) but it is occasionally used as a melodic instrument.

===Hawaii===

The Hawaiian ukulele also has four strings and a shape similar to the cavaquinho, although tuned differently – usually G C E A.

The ukulele is an iconic element of Hawaiian popular music, which spread to the continental United States in the early 20th century. It was developed from the braguinha and rajão, brought to Hawaii in the late 19th century by Portuguese immigrants from Madeira Island.

The &quot;machete&quot; was introduced into Hawaii by Augusto Dias, Manuel Nunes, and João Fernandes in 1879, which further influenced the development of the ukulele.

===Northern Latin America and the Caribbean===
The &quot;cuatro&quot; is a family of larger 4-stringed instruments derived from the cavaquinho that are popular in Latin-American countries in and around the Caribbean. Versions of the iconic Venezuelan cuatro are very similar to the Brazilian cavaquinho, with a neck laid level with the sound box, like a Portuguese cavaquinho.

==Origins==

The origins of this Portuguese instrument are elusive. Author Gonçalo Sampaio holds that the cavaquinho and the guitar may have been brought to Braga by the Biscayans.

Sampaio explains Minho region’s archaic and Hellenistic modes by possible survival of Greek influences on the ancient Gallaeci of the region, and stresses the link between this instrument and historical Hellenistic tetrachords.

<doc id="743761" wikidata="Q1402386" url="?curid=743761" title="Touring car">
<text>Touring car and tourer are both terms for open cars (i.e. cars without a fixed roof). &quot;Touring car&quot; is a style of open car built in the United States which seats four or more people. The style was popular from the early 1900s to the 1930s. The cars used for touring car racing in various series since the 1960s, are unrelated to these early touring cars, despite sharing the same name.

&quot;Tourer&quot; is used in British English for any open car. The term &quot;all-weather tourer&quot; was used to describe convertibles (vehicles that could be fully enclosed). A popular version of the tourer was the torpedo, with the hood/bonnet line level at the car&#x27;s waistline giving the car a straight line from front to back.

==Touring car (U.S.)==
===Design===
&quot;Touring car&quot; was applied in the U.S. to open cars (cars without a fixed roof, for example convertibles) that seat four or more people and have direct entrance to the tonneau (rear passenger area), although it has also been described as seating five or more people. Touring cars may have two or four doors, and the drivetrain layouts of early touring cars was either front- or mid-engined.

When the top was folded down, it formed a bulky mass known as the &quot;fan&quot; behind the back seat: &quot;fan covers&quot; were made to protect the top and its wooden ribs while in the down position. Some touring cars were available with side curtains to protect occupants from wind and weather by snapping or zipping them into place; otherwise, the occupants had minimal weather protection.

===History===
The touring car body style was popular in the early 20th century, being a larger alternative to the two-seat runabout and the roadster. By the mid-1910s, the touring car body had evolved into several types, including the four-door touring car which was equipped with a convertible top.

Most of Model T&#x27;s produced by Ford between 1908 and 1927 were four and then three-door models (with drivers sliding behind the wheel from passenger seat) touring cars, accounting for 6,519,643 cars sold out of the 15,000,000 estimated Model T&#x27;s built. This accounted for 44% of all Model T&#x27;s sold over the model&#x27;s eighteen-plus year life span, making it the most popular body style.

The popularity of the touring car began to wane in the 1920s when cars with enclosed passenger compartments (i.e. fixed steel roofs) became more affordable, and began to consistently out-sell the open cars.

====Demi-Limousine====
For a brief time, touring sedans were offered with a solid back and permanent roof, unlike the roof on a touring sedan which could be folded back and stowed. Neither version offered permanent protection from the elements.
==Tourer in British English==
&quot;Tourer&quot; is used for open cars.

The belt lines of 1930s tourers were often lowered at the front doors to suggest a more sporting character (however, this only allowed for removable glass or Perspex/Plexiglas side screens; wind-up windows, introduced later, required a more horizonal belt line on the doors).

Just as in the U.S, all-weather tourers are cars with high quality tops and glass side windows; they were later called convertibles.


===Torpedo body===

The torpedo was a style of 4-seat or 5-seat tourers built from 1908 until the mid-1930s. The design consists of a hood/bonnet line raised to be level with the car&#x27;s waistline, resulting in a straight beltline from front to back.

<text>Smooth jazz is a term used to describe commercially oriented crossover jazz music. Although often described as a &quot;genre&quot;, it is a debatable and highly controversial subject in jazz music circles. As a radio format, however, smooth jazz radio became the successor to easy listening music on radio station programming from the mid-1970s through the early 1990s.

== History ==
Smooth jazz may be thought of as commercially-oriented, crossover jazz which came to prominence in the 1980s, displacing the more venturesome jazz fusion from which it emerged. It avoids the improvisational &quot;risk-taking&quot; of jazz fusion, emphasizing melodic form, and much of the music was initially &quot;a combination of jazz with easy-listening pop music and lightweight R&amp;B.&quot;

During the mid-1970s in the United States, it was known as &quot;smooth radio&quot;; the genre was not termed &quot;smooth jazz&quot; until the 1980s.

The term itself seems to have been birthed directly out of radio marketing efforts. In an industry focus group in the late 1980s, one participant coined the phrase &quot;smooth jazz&quot; and it stuck.

The popularity of smooth jazz as a radio format grew in the 80s and 90s, but gradually declined in the early 2000s. By 2009, many stations including in NYC, Washington, DC, and Boston had switched away from the format. 

“Smooth jazz” was by far the dominant market force in jazz at the end of the century, and it sidetracked the artistic lives of some musicians who might have made more interesting music but for the draw of big paydays. But the radio stations playing sax-and-synth dominated lite funk faded in the first decade of the 21st century. 

==Pioneers and Notable songs==
Smooth Jazz was arguably pioneered in the early 1970&#x27;s, with notable songs and artists including: &quot;Grazing in the grass&quot; (1968), by trumpeter Hugh Masekela, &quot;Nautilus&quot; (1974) by keyboardist Bob James, and &quot;Mister Magic&quot; (1975) by saxophist Grover Washington, Jr..

Other early popular releases include guitarist George Benson&#x27;s 1976 cover/version of &quot;Breezin&#x27;&quot; and flugelhorn player Chuck Mangione&#x27;s &quot;Feels So Good&quot; in 1977. Others are &quot;What You Won&#x27;t Do for Love&quot; by Bobby Caldwell in 1978, jazz fusion group Spyro Gyra&#x27;s 1979 instrumental song &quot;Morning Dance&quot; and the 1981 collaboration between Grover Washington Jr. and Bill Withers on &quot;Just the Two of Us&quot;. 

Smooth jazz grew in popularity in the 1980s and 1990s as Anita Baker, Sade, Al Jarreau,  Grover Washington Jr. and Kenny G released multiple hit songs.

==Critical and public reception==
The smooth jazz genre experienced a backlash exemplified by critical complaints about the &quot;bland&quot; sound of top-selling saxophonist Kenny G, whose popularity peaked with his 1992 album &quot;Breathless&quot;.

Music reviewer George Graham argues that the &quot;so-called &#x27;smooth jazz&#x27; sound of people like Kenny G has none of the fire and creativity that marked the best of the fusion scene during its heyday in the 1970s&quot;.

Digby Fairweather, before the start of UK jazz station theJazz, denounced the change to a smooth jazz format on defunct radio station 102.2 Jazz FM; he stated that the owners GMG Radio were responsible for the &quot;attempted rape and (fortunately abortive) re-definition of the music — is one that no true jazz lover within the boundaries of the M25 will ever find it possible to forget or forgive.&quot;

<doc id="743770" wikidata="Q645977" url="?curid=743770" title="Komuz">
<text>The komuz or qomuz ( , , ) is an ancient fretless string instrument used in Central Asian music, related to certain other Turkic string instruments, the Mongolian tovshuur, and the lute. 

The instrument can be found in Turkic ethnic groups, from China to Turkey. Forms of this instrument are used in China by the Naxi people and are called Huobusi, Hebisi, and Hunbusi.

It is the best-known national instrument and one of the better-known Kyrgyz national symbols. The komuz is generally made from a single piece of wood (usually apricot or juniper) and has three strings traditionally made out of gut, and often from fishing line in modern times. 

In the most common tunings the middle string is the highest in pitch. 

Virtuosos frequently play the komuz in a variety of different positions: over the shoulder, between the knees and upside down. 

An illustration of a komuz is featured on the reverse of the one-som note.

==Playing style==
The komuz can be used either as accompaniment or as a lead instrument and is used in a wide variety of musical styles including aytysh (a song competition between akyns) and the recitation of epics. It is generally played seated, held horizontally and may be strummed or plucked. 

One piece (&quot;mash botoy&quot;) consists of a simple tune repeated many times, each with a new stroke, as a test of the performer’s skill and creativity. The komuz has many different tunings, and the names of the tunings correspond with various styles of music.

== History ==

The word &quot;komuz&quot; is cognate to the names of other instruments in the Music of Central Asia, including the Kazakh &quot;kobyz&quot; (Uzbek &quot;qo&#x27;biz&quot;) (bowed instruments), and the Tuvan and Sakha or Yakut &quot;xomus&quot; (a jaw harp).

The oldest known komuz-like instrument dates from the 4th century although the related Azerbaijani gopuz is believed to date back to 6000 BC following an archaeological discovery of clay plates depicting gopuz players. In the 1960s American archeologists working in the Shushdagh mountains near the ancient city of Jygamish in Iranian Azerbaijan, uncovered a number of rare clay plates which dated back to around 6000 B.C. which depicted musicians at a council, holding a komuz-like instrument to their chests. 

The golcha gopuz was mentioned in the epic Book of Dede Korkut.

The names of parts of the komuz are often allusions to body parts, particularly of horses. For example, the neck is called &quot;neck&quot;, the tuning pegs are called , or &quot;ear&quot;s. The Kyrgyz word кыл/qyl means &quot;string of an instrument&quot; or &quot;horse&#x27;s hair&quot;.

The ancient komuz generally had two or three strings. The three-stringed &quot;golcha gopuz&quot; was more popular in ancient Azerbaijan and Anatolia: the two-stringed &quot;gil gopuz&quot; or &quot;iklyg&quot; was used on the Altai plains, in parts of Turkmenistan and in Chinese territory inhabited by the Uyghur people.

The golcha gopuz is made from a leather covering which covered around two-thirds of the surface, and the other third is covered with thin wood along with the sound board. The total length of the instrument is 810 mm, with the body 410 mm, the width 240 mm and the height or breadth only 20 mm.
The (, literally &quot;mouth komuz&quot;) or, alternatively, (, literally &quot;metal komuz&quot; or &quot;iron komuz&quot;), is a jaw harp and as an instrument is unrelated to the komuz.

During the Soviet era the instrument fell from favour. It was derided as rudimentary and attempts were made to make it more like the Russian balalaika, notably by adding frets. After independence the komuz was again taught in music colleges, though some of the Soviet changes have remained.

In the twentieth century the late Iranian dutar player Haj Ghorban Soleimani invented a new form of the komuz which has received some popularity.

=== Legendary origin===
In legends, Dede Korkut is seen as the inventor of the kopuz. In &quot;The Book of Dede Korkut&quot;, his special bond with the kopuz is not limited to his performances as a bard. Of particular importance, there is a passage in the story about the brothers Egrek and Segrek. When Segrek wants to attack Egrek, because he thinks he is dealing with an infidel, he says:
Thus a random lute is directly connected to Dede Korkut here, which is presumably a reference to the fact that he was the inventor there.

==Related instruments==
Different variations of the komuz spread to several eastern European countries such as Ukraine, Poland and Hungary during the 4th-5th century A.D, during the mass migration of the Huns into the region. There they became known with similar variations of the name. (See : kobza)

In Dagestan (a Russian republic between Chechnya and the Caspian Sea, just east of Georgia in the Caucasus) a special instrument mentioned in both the Vertkov&#x27;s Atlas SSSR, and in Buchner&#x27;s book, is called agach komus, or temur by the Avar people. It seems a kind of slender guitar with 3 strings, with a body (carved from one block of wood) shaped like a spade and fitted with a trident-like spike at the lower end.

The Qanbūs of the Arabian and Malay peninsulae is considered by Sachs to derive its name from the komuz. The five-string kopuz is also thought to have transformed into the six-string instrument known as the sestar or seshane by 13th-century mystic Rumi. The word &quot;sestar&quot; is mentioned in the poems of the 14th-century poet Yunus Emre. Evliya Çelebi describes the kopuz as a smaller version of the seshane.

===Modern huobosi===
Although the term huobosi still applies to the traditional instrument, in China a newer instrument has evolved from the older instrument, resembling a guitar and called the Huobosi.

<text>The Middle Santiam River is a tributary of the South Santiam River, long, in western Oregon in the United States. It drains a remote area of the Cascade Range east of Sweet Home in the watershed of the Willamette River.

It rises in the Cascades in eastern Linn County in the Willamette National Forest, about half a mile west of Iron Mountain. It flows briefly north, then generally west and southwest through the mountains and Middle Santiam Wilderness. In central Linn County it is impounded at the Green Peter Dam to form the Green Peter Reservoir.

<text>Judy Baar Topinka (; January 16, 1944 – December 10, 2014) was an American politician and member of the Republican Party from the U.S. State of Illinois.

Originally a journalist, Topinka served in the Illinois House of Representatives from 1981 to 1985 and in the Illinois Senate from 1985 to 1995. She was elected to three terms as Illinois State Treasurer, serving from 1995 to 2007. She was the first woman to become state treasurer, the first to be elected to three consecutive terms, and the first Republican to hold the post in more than 32 years. During her last term as treasurer, she was the only Republican to hold statewide elected office in Illinois. In 2002, she was elected chair of the Illinois Republican Party, holding that office until 2005.

She declined to run for re-election as treasurer in 2006, instead running for Governor of Illinois. In March 2006, she was nominated as the Republican candidate. She was the second woman (after 1994 Democratic nominee Dawn Clark Netsch) and first Republican woman to be nominated for governor of Illinois. She lost the election to Democratic incumbent Rod Blagojevich.

In 2010, she successfully ran for the office of Illinois Comptroller. She was re-elected to a second four-year term in November 2014, but died of a stroke only a month later.

==Early years==
Topinka was born in the Chicago, Illinois, suburb of Riverside to Lillian Mary (Shuss) and William D. Baar, the children of Czech and Slovak immigrants. After graduating from Ferry Hall School in Lake Forest in 1962, she attended Northwestern University in nearby Evanston. Topinka received a Bachelor of Science degree in journalism from the university&#x27;s Medill School of Journalism. She was a member of the Alpha Gamma Delta sorority.

==Journalism and public relations careers==
After graduating from Northwestern, Topinka became a reporter for several suburban Chicago newspapers, eventually becoming an editor. On the side, Topinka established her own public relations business, through which she began a career in consulting for various political candidates.

==Political career==

===Legislative career===
In 1980, Topinka first pursued her own career in politics by running for the Illinois General Assembly. She won a seat in the Illinois House of Representatives and served two two-year terms, respectively for the 7th and 43rd districts. In 1984, she set her sights on the upper house of the Illinois General Assembly and won a seat in the Illinois Senate where she represented the 22nd district for ten years.

===Illinois State Treasurer===

In the middle of a term as state senator, Topinka joined the Illinois State Treasurer race in 1994 and won the election. She was reelected in 1998 and 2002.

As state treasurer, Topinka cut a deal to allow hotels that were owned by indicted Springfield power-broker Bill Cellini to pay $10 million to settle their debts which totaled $40.3 million. This deal was quashed by Attorney General Jim Ryan who stated that the hotels were worth more than the $10 million for which Topinka had attempted to settle the debt.

===Illinois gubernatorial campaign===

On November 7, 2005, Topinka announced that she would not seek re-election as state treasurer—instead, she entered the gubernatorial primary, hoping to challenge Democratic Governor Rod Blagojevich. The Republican primary was deeply divisive; her tenure as Party chairman destroyed her support from the conservative wing of her party, and it was feared that her pro-choice and positive gay rights positions would be detrimental to her standing with the same conservatives. In December she announced that she would join forces with DuPage County State&#x27;s Attorney Joe Birkett as a candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Illinois.

In February 2006, the candidates for the Republican nomination for Illinois Governor began running their first TV ads for the March statewide primary election. Rival candidate Ron Gidwitz&#x27;s advertisements, attacking Topinka, were rebuked in the same week by the Illinois Republican Party: &quot;In an unprecedented action, the Illinois Republican Party has officially rebuked the Gidwitz campaign for this ad because the Party found that the ad violates the Party&#x27;s &quot;Code of Conduct,&quot; which was enacted to police proper conduct among Republican candidates.&quot;

Later in February, candidate Jim Oberweis, another rival for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, started a series of attack ads against Topinka for television markets that were even more widely criticized, mostly for using &quot;fake&quot; headlines on the images of actual Illinois newspapers. These ads, like Gidwitz&#x27;s ads, also came under review by the Illinois Republican Party. Because of the controversy generated, several television stations withdrew Oberweis&#x27;s ads.

On March 21, 2006, Topinka won the Republican nomination with 37 percent of the vote.

On November 7, 2006, she lost the race to Blagojevich.

===Illinois Comptroller===
Topinka was a candidate for the office of Illinois State Comptroller in the 2010 election, facing conservative radio host William J. Kelly and Orland Park Village Trustee Jim Dodge in the Republican primary. She won the nomination with 59% of the vote. She went on to win the general election against Illinois state representative David E. Miller (D), Julie Fox (L) and E. Erika Schafer (G). She won re-election in November 2014.

==Personal life and death==
In 1965, she married Joe Topinka. They had a son, Joseph, before divorcing in 1981.

Topinka was a member of the Illinois St. Andrew Society and attended multiple events for it throughout the year. She could play four instruments and could fluently speak four languages, English, Czech, Spanish and Polish.

On December 9, 2014, Topinka was admitted to MacNeal Hospital in Berwyn, a western suburb of Chicago, after reporting discomfort. After undergoing tests, she appeared to be doing well. However, overnight she suddenly lost consciousness and was pronounced dead from a stroke at shortly after 2 a.m. on December 10. President Barack Obama referred to Topinka as &quot;an institution in Illinois politics&quot;, citing her service in a statement from the White House. Illinois Governor Pat Quinn said it was a &quot;sad day in the state of Illinois&quot;, calling her &quot;a trailblazer in every sense of the word&quot;. Topinka was succeeded by Jerry Stermer as comptroller.

<text>Vivinus cars were made by Ateliers Vivinus S.A., a company founded in 1899 in Schaerbeek, Brussels. The company was renamed Automobiles Vivinus S.A. in 1908.

The owner, Alexis Vivinus (1860-1929), had made bicycles in the 1890s and become an importer of Benz. From 1895 he started to make his own range of cars. These were belt-driven voiturette models with a 785 cc single-cylinder engine and 2-speed transmission by belt drive. Licences to make his designs were sold to firms such as New Orleans of England, Georges Richard of France and De Dietrich in Germany.

From 1907 a range of more conventional 4-cylinder cars were made with shaft drive, along with motorcycles and aero engines.

The company went into liquidation in 1912. The workshop was taken over by . Vivinus himself later joined Minerva.

<doc id="743785" wikidata="Q385166" url="?curid=743785" title="Ruling class">
<text>In sociology, the ruling class of a society is the social class who set and decide the political and economic agenda of society. 

In Marxist philosophy, the ruling class are the class who own the means of production in a given society and apply their cultural hegemony to determine and establish the dominant ideology (ideas, culture, mores, norms, traditions) of the society. They are also called the bourgeoisie. 

In the 21st century, the worldwide political economy established by globalization has created a transnational capitalist class who are not native to any one country.

== Background==
In previous modes of production, such as feudalism (inheritable property and rights), the feudal lords of the manor were the ruling class; in an economy based upon chattel slavery, the slave owners were the ruling class. The political economy of the feudal system gave socio-economic and legal power to the feudal lord over the life, labour, and property of the vassal, including military service. The political economy of a slave state gave the slaver socio-economic and legal power over the person, labour, and property of a slave.

In Marxist philosophy, the capitalist society has two social classes: (i) the ruling-class bourgeoisie (capitalist class) who own the means of production as private property; and (ii) the working-class proletariat whom the bourgeoisie subject to the exploitation of labour, which form of political economy is justified by the dominant ideology of the ruling class. To replace the capitalist mode of production in a society, Marxism seeks to void the political legitimacy of the ruling class to hold power of government. Afterwards, the proletariat (the urban working class and the peasantry) assume political and socio-economic power as the ruling class of society.

In the political economies of the former Marxist-Leninist states, the nomenklatura are the ruling class who control the means of production, allocate resources, etc for the society, per the directions of the party. As the administrators of the bureaucracy required to realise the socio-economic functions of the state. In that vein, the sociologist C. Wright Mills identified and distinguished between the ruling class and the power élite who make the decisions for society.

Likewise, to establish a society without social classes, Anarchism seeks to abolish the ruling class. Unlike the Marxist perspective, anarchists, such as Mikhail Bakunin, seek to abolish the state, because, despite revolutionary change, the (capitalist) ruling class would be replaced by another ruling class (party leaders), which is a political cycle that voids the social-change purpose of a revolution.

Concerning the existence of a functional ruling class in 21st-century societies, Mattei Dogan said that the political and socio-economic élites do not form a cohesive ruling class within their societies because of the social stratification and the narrow specialisation of labour consequent to the globalization of the world economy. In contrast, for the 20th century, he identifies the combination of military defeat, political implosion and the presence of a charismatic leader as the drivers for the downfall of ruling classes in the Russian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and later for the creation of Vichy France.

<doc id="743787" wikidata="Q3570312" url="?curid=743787" title="X-Treme X-Men">
<text>X-Treme X-Men is the name of two comic book series published by Marvel Comics, the first from 2001 through 2004, and the second from 2012 through 2013. All 46 issues of the first series were written by Chris Claremont, and featured a globetrotting X-Men team led by Storm. The first 24 issues were drawn by Salvador Larroca, and the final 22 issues were drawn by Igor Kordey.

Volume 2 of &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; featured a cast of X-Men characters from alternate dimensions, but led by Dazzler from the main Earth-616 universe. The series was written by Greg Pak. The thirteenth and final issue was released in April 2013.

==Volume 1==
Volume 1 of the series originated as part of a revamp of the X-Men line of comics in 2001. Prior to this revamp, Claremont was writing both of the main X-Men titles (&quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; and &quot;X-Men&quot;, the latter of which became &quot;New X-Men&quot;, and then &quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot;). He was removed from both core X-titles by Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada when his storylines fell apart due to editorial interference by the previous editor-in-chief in a failed attempt to capitalize on the first X-Men movie. Quesada offered Claremont the opportunity to write only one of the core X-titles (while allowing new X-writer Grant Morrison to have partial storyline input) or to write a third, new core X-Men title. Claremont chose the latter. That title was dubbed &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot;.

In May 2004, prompted by Grant Morrison&#x27;s departure from &quot;New X-Men&quot;, Marvel felt that another revamp of the X-Men titles was required. As part of this revamp, called X-Men Reload, Chris Claremont returned to writing &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;. &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; was cancelled, with most of its cast and running plotlines being transferred to &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;. Joss Whedon and John Cassaday&#x27;s &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; replaced it as the third core title.

===Team roster===
The X-Treme X-Men contained Storm, Rogue, Gambit, Bishop, Sage (Tessa), Thunderbird (Neal Shaara), Psylocke and Beast as original line up. Psylocke was killed and Beast departed the title in the early goings, and new recruits Lifeguard (Heather Cameron) and Slipstream (Davis Cameron) were eventually added. Later in the series, familiar X-Men characters Cannonball, Lila Cheney, Shadowcat, Magma and Sunspot made regular appearances, with only Cannonball officially joining the team. Evangeline Whedon (a mutant possessing dragon transmorphic abilities) also made numerous appearances.

The title also introduced the character of Red Lotus, who featured heavily in the Australian arc, and was included in issues of the invasion arc.

===Story===
The book picked up on many plot threads from Claremont&#x27;s run on the two main X-Men books. The book is most notable for the death of the popular character Psylocke (now resurrected) in its early issues, and it showed how Beast mutated into his lion-like form.

The first arc (issues 1–4) concerns the quest on the part of Storm and a number of X-Men chosen by her to find Destiny&#x27;s 13 diaries since none like the idea of having their destinies defined. The arc also introduces Vargas (a new foe who is disturbed by the diaries&#x27; predictions of his death), who kills Psylocke in order to test the diaries&#x27; predictions. He also heavily injured Beast, which leads to the character&#x27;s transition to New X-Men.

In the second arc (Savage Land 1–4), the team travel to the Savage Land, where they escort the Saurids to a land where they will not be persecuted. The team tangles and defeats Brainchild (who makes Storm lose control of her powers for a time, bringing out her inner warrior akin to Wolverine&#x27;s berserker rage). This disturbed her for some time.
The third arc (issues 5–9) involves Gambit in Australia and the warring gangs. The leader of an Australian mafia (known as the Viceroy) dies mysteriously (as if drowning in his own room), and the team must protect his mutant children (Lifeguard and Slipstream who were in the dark as to their real father). The mafia and police accuse Gambit of murder of the gang leader and Bishop and Rogue take charge to clear his name. As a team learns Lady Mastermind and Sebastian Shaw are behind everything, the two villains capture Shaw&#x27;s former assistant, Sage. Caught between the two villains and a mafia gang war, the team is able to rescue Sage, clear Gambit&#x27;s name, and protect the now two newest members of the team (Lifeguard and Slipstream).

The Annual (2001) deals with Reavers, the Shadow King, and contains a backup story featuring Kitty Pryde and the threat of Purity. 
The next story arc (issues 10–18) fundamentally changes the title. The team again reunites with Gambit in Madripoor and deals with the invasion of the armies of Khan, an inter-dimensional conqueror. Gambit seeks to obtain Ororo&#x27;s mother&#x27;s ruby which was part of a set that, when empowered, could open a portal between dimensions. Since some gems are already missing, Gambit wants to ensure that Ororo&#x27;s ruby remains safe. However, Gambit is attacked by an other-dimensional warrior named Shaitan, capturing Gambit and stealing the ruby. Shaitan then uses the gems and Gambit&#x27;s mutant ability to empower them, thus opening the portal for his master, Khan (who, taken by Ororo&#x27;s powers and beauty, wants to make her his queen). Ororo&#x27;s X-Men oppose and defeat the invaders, but not before Ororo is seriously injured by Madripoor&#x27;s ruling crime lord Viper (before the battle) and by Khan&#x27;s harem (during the battle).

Sage activates all of the powers that Rogue has ever imprinted at once, enabling Rogue to turn the tide of the battle. During the melee, Vargas returns to kill Rogue, after the diaries predicted she&#x27;d kill him. As Rogue is attempting to save Gambit, she gets trapped by that same energy that empowers the portal. While they are trapped, Vargas impales them both with a huge broadsword. Rogue uses the strength of Wolverine and the Hulk to overcome her injury, though Gambit remains close to death. Rogue finds Vargas and fights him in order to avenge Psylocke&#x27;s death and his attempted murder of her and Gambit, as predicted in the diaries. The fight is filmed by a news crew and just as the camera loses power, Rogue is shown standing over Vargas with a sword, poised to strike. It is not actually shown if she kills him or not.

In the midst of the battle in Khan&#x27;s invasion platform, Lifeguard&#x27;s power reacts unexpectedly to conceal her identity, leaving her permanently as gold-skinned, bird-like humanoid - revealing her Shi&#x27;Ar heritage. Her brother, Slipstream, reacts badly to this and runs off to parts unknown. The team succeeds in defeating Khan as other heroes join in the relief efforts. Storm, Rogue, and Gambit, all near death, are saved with the arrival of Jean Grey, as well as Nightcrawler and Beast. With the help of Beast&#x27;s surgical expertise, Jean Grey telepathically pulls Storm and Rogue from the abyss of death, and helps Rogue do the same for Gambit (who views this as his one chance for salvation and pleads with Rogue to cross over with him until she pulls him back). Lifeguard and Thunderbird leave the title with this arc, going after Slipstream. Rogue and Gambit take time to recuperate.

In the next few issues (19 and X-Posé 1–2) (arcs 6 and 7), while the team is recuperating, they have dinner with their old teammates. However, it&#x27;s made quite clear that Xavier&#x27;s views have changed and a philosophical rift begins. The team deals with the public relations aspect of what they do. The team attempts to keep a mutant documentary on the air, despite efforts to kill it because it is not derogatory. The team succeeds, but another old teammate, Archangel, refuses to allow them to manipulate the media that way.

Issues 20-23 (arc 8) deal with a very young mutant killer seeking asylum at Xavier&#x27;s Institute. Emma Frost promptly kicks out members Sage and Bishop when they visit because she believes that mutants should police themselves. The team breaks into the mansion to bring the boy to the proper authorities. However, a possessed Emma intercepts them. She is possessed by Elias Bogan, an old acquaintance from the Hellfire Club that she and Sage have met before. After an argument with Professor X elsewhere, Ororo arrives to help her teammates. However, old emotions rise to the surface as Ororo fights Emma Frost. Emma shakes the possession outside the mansion during the fight, but they continue to battle until Storm shows that she&#x27;s willing to kill Emma and has the ability to do so. Elias Bogan proves to be the threat behind the murders. Storm and Emma pull it together long enough to facilitate the rest of the team&#x27;s escape, who then stop Bogan, though certainly not for good. The philosophical rift between the two groups of X-Men reaches its peak here when the X-Treme X-Men promise not to return to the mansion again until the dream of peaceful coexistence is, once again, the goal the X-Men, instead of what the X-Treme X-Men believe to be isolationism and possible mutant supremacy.

Kitty Pryde&#x27;s &quot;Mekanix&quot; miniseries (arc 9) deals with her college life right after she leaves the X-Men and has to face Purity as well as the Sentinels.

The return of Cannonball takes place in issue 24 and issues 25-30 (arcs 10 and 11) contain a story line dealing with Reverend William Stryker, a follow-up to Claremont&#x27;s 1982 &quot;X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills&quot; graphic novel.

Issues 31-35 (arc 12) see the return of Rogue and Gambit. Storm offers her team&#x27;s services to the United Nations as a global mutant police force, the X-Treme Sanctions Executive (XSE), wherein mutants will continue to be bound by the human laws, but be policed by other mutants. They succeed as the government is searching for a way to contain the mutant threat. Also, the team fights against powerful mutants who have taken over a town in California and are pushing out the human inhabitants by force. This begins back and forth attacks between mutants and humans, while the team tries to establish peace and bring the aggressors to justice. Though the team doesn&#x27;t discover it, it&#x27;s revealed that Elias Bogan is lurking around the edges, influencing events to a degree.

Issues 36-39 (what could be considered arc 13) deal with one of Ororo&#x27;s missions as part of XSE (i.e., exposing mutant slave trading network and gladiatorial battle arena in Japan). Issues 40-45 again deal with the threat posed by Elias Bogan trying to get his final revenge on the group. Issue 46 (the final issue) shows Kitty Pryde returning to the X-Men fold and the X-Treme team deciding what to do next: return to the Xavier Institute or find a different path.

==Volume 2==
&quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; was relaunched as a new series in 2012 with no connection to the previous volume and a concept similar to &quot;Exiles&quot;, featuring Dazzler, Sage, and alternate dimensional versions of familiar X-Men characters, such as Howlett, an alternate Wolverine, Kurt Waggoner, a younger version of Nightcrawler, and Corporal Scott Summers, a Civil War-era African-American version of Cyclops. The series is written by Greg Pak and is a spinoff of his 2011 &quot;Exalted&quot; storyline from &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;. The series&#x27; parallel universe hopping concept is similar to the previous Marvel series &quot;Exiles&quot;.

The &quot;X-Termination&quot; event ended the series with issue #13. The storyline crosses over with &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; and the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; series.

===Story===
The team&#x27;s mission is to explore the multiverse and hunt down ten evil Xaviers after an inter-universe teleportation awakens them. So far, the team have defeated three: one on a world where mutants are gods, another in a wild-west scenario, and a giant spacewhale being controlled by a Brood Queen. After those two missions, Kurt Waggoner takes a detour to his home reality, with Dazzler and Howlett giving chase. They rescued him with some unexpected assistance from Sage, who has been ambassador of S.W.O.R.D. since she was last seen with the Exiles.

Afterward, they were reunited with Xavier, who since recruited an alternate Cyclops, Dazzler, and Hercules to help. The teams merged and the alternate Dazzler died facing a Witch King Xavier in the next reality, prompting 616 Dazzler to take her costume. In the next reality, Namor fought a Nazi Xavier and Dazzler was able to kill Nazi Xavier. However, Witch King Xavier faked his death and controlled the team&#x27;s Xavier while resurrecting Nazi Xavier. The three Xaviers fled into another reality, sacrificing the natives to gain more power. The X-Treme X-Men followed and freed their Xavier. Unfortunately, the power source the other Xaviers used grew and killed them, opening a rift in the multiverse that swallowed the natives. The team got away in time and followed the rift, leading into the X-Termination crossover with Astonishing X-Men and Age of Apocalypse.

During the crossover, AoA Nightcrawler&#x27;s trip home resulted in the release of three evil beings that destroy anyone they touch. Several casualties resulted, including the AoA&#x27;s Nightcrawler, Sabretooth, Horror Show, and Fiend, as well as the X-Treme X-Men&#x27;s Kurt Waggoner, Xavier and Hercules. The crossover ended with the apparent destruction of the AoA universe. The surviving X-Treme X-Men team members, Dazzler, Sage, Howlett, and Corporal Summers all remained on Earth-616.

<text>Wat Tham Krabok (, literally &#x27;Temple of the Bamboo Cave&#x27;) is a Buddhist temple (&quot;wat&quot;) in the Phra Phutthabat District of Saraburi Province, Thailand.

The temple was first established as a monastery in 1957 by the Buddhist nun Mian Parnchand (generally known as Luang Por Yai) and her two nephews, Chamroon and Charoen Parnchand, who had both ordained as monks at Wat Khlong Mao in Lopburi Province. Luang Por Chamroon, a former Thai policeman, was the first abbot, although Wat Tham Krabok was not officially a Buddhist temple, it was granted official &#x27;Wat&#x27; status in 2012. Uniquely, it continues to follow the teachings of Luang Por Yai, a woman. The entrance now correctly claims it is a temple or &quot;wat&quot;. The temple is majestic in its appearance, with two elephants supporting a globe marking its entrance. There are many large Buddha images on the temple grounds.

Wat Tham Krabok has received global attention for its heroin and opium drug rehabilitation program, which was started in 1959. Over 100,000 heroin and opium addicts have since gone through the Wat Tham Krabok detox program, a program consisting of Buddhist meditation, induced vomiting, and the consumption of a secret detoxification potion composed of many different herbs. In 1975, Luang Por Chamrun Parnchand was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for the temple&#x27;s drug rehabilitation work.

A number of Western drug users have sought treatment for their addictions at Wat Tham Krabok, In 2002 Stuart Brindley became the first methadone addict from the UK to be treated at the monastery while other Westerners including British punk rock musician Pete Doherty, Irish rock music singer Christy Dignam of Aslan, American computer underground personality Patrick K. Kroupa, and British singer songwriter Tim Arnold.

In 2004, Tim Arnold&#x27;s success story was the subject of many news articles in the UK. After completing his programme Arnold subsequently became a permanent Tham Krabok resident and favourite of the monastery&#x27;s abbot, Luang Por Charoen.

Because opium used to be commonly grown and, at times, consumed by the Hmong (largely for medicinal purposes) in the highlands of Thailand and Laos, some Hmong refugees have undergone addiction treatment at Wat Tham Krabok. Wat Tham Krabok also supports the detoxification of those addicted to alcohol and methamphetamines.

==Hmong refugees==
Following the end of the Vietnam War, in the late 1970s, Wat Tham Krabok hosted Hmong refugees in a camp on its grounds as the result of their participation in the Secret War. Most had fled Laos alleging that they were persecuted by the communist government that ruled Laos since 1975. Many thousands of the Laotian and Hmong refugees and asylum seekers at Wat Tham Krabok had also sought refuge at the temple after fleeing forced repatriation efforts at other refugee camps in Thailand, because they did not want to return to the Marxist government in Laos. More Lao and Hmong refugees continued to arrive and seek sanctuary at Wat Tham Krabok until over 15,000 Hmong were eventually allowed, after a long policy battle in both the United States and Thailand, to emigrate to the US in 2004 and 2005 as political refugees, instead of being forced back to Laos. Some moved to the United States as early as in 2001.

In the late 1970s, Wat Tham Krabok, and particularly its abbot, Luang Por Chamroon, supported Hmong armed resistance against the Lao PDR government, particularly the Neo Hom led by General Vang Pao and other Laotian leaders, independent Chao Fa groups, and one sub-faction of the Chao Fa led by Pa Kao Her. The Hmong were US allies in the secret war against the communist Pathet Lao, the Viet Cong, and North Vietnam.

When several Thailand-based Hmong refugee camps closed due to a lack of financial support in the early 1990s, Lao and Hmong refugees in Thailand fled to the temple to avoid repatriation to Laos. The population at the temple quickly grew to about 35,000, although it later declined significantly.

Starting in 1993, the Washington, D.C.–based The Centre for Public Policy Analysis (CPPA), and its Executive Director, Philip Smith, made over seven research missions to Wat Tham Krabok and Laotian and Hmong refugee camps in Thailand. Philip Smith, the CPPA, and the Lao Veterans of America, repeatedly conducted US congressional-backed research missions on the plight of Laotian and Hmong refugees fleeing forced repatriation and human rights violations in communist Laos and Thailand. These joint US congressional and CPPA research missions sought to review policy developments in Thailand and Laos, and to convey humanitarian offers of support and assistance to the abbot, temple monks, and Hmong and Laotian refugee leaders, from members of congress and international human rights organizations. For over a decade, prominent members of congress, in bipartisan fashion, also supported US-backed research missions by Philip Smith and the CPPA to Wat Tham Krabok, and the Laotian and Hmong refugee camps along the Mekong River and Thai-Lao border. Support for these missions came from a bipartisan coalition in the US Congress, including Congressman Steve Gunderson (Republican-Wisconsin), Congressman Bruce Vento (D-Minnesota), Senator Paul Wellstone (D-Minnesota) and others. The findings of these missions were frequently discussed in news stories, and at sessions of the US Congressional Forum on Laos held in the US Congress and Library of Congress.

Wat Tham Krabok and its Hmong refugees drew global attention in the late 1980s and mid-1990s, as they became the subject of a major global political debate over their future, and the future of Lao and Hmong refugees and asylum seekers in Thailand. The government of Thailand, with support from the United Nations and the Clinton administration, sought to repatriate the Lao-Hmong at Wat Tham Krabok back to the communist regime in Laos that the Lao-Hmong refugees fled. This effort drew opposition from several human rights groups, and some key Hmong organizations.

Lao and Hmong human scholar and advocate, Vang Pobzeb, of the Wisconsin and Minnesota-based Lao Human Rights Council, participated in a number of research missions with Philip Smith and The Centre for Public Policy Analysis, as well as Congressmen Bruce Vento and Steve Gunderson, to the Lao and Hmong refugee camps in Thailand and to Wat Tham Krabok during the 1980s and 1990s. US Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and others in the US Senate were active in raising concerns about egregious human rights violations in Laos and the plight of Lao and Hmong refugees and asylum seekers who fled Laos to refugee camps in Thailand and to Wat Tham Krabok.

Michael Johns, a former Heritage Foundation foreign policy analyst and aide to former President George H. W. Bush, helped oppose the forced repatriation, labeling it a &quot;betrayal&quot;, since many Hmong had aided the United States during the secret war.

While some Hmong were repatriated, most were resettled to the United States in 2004 and 2005, most moving to the U.S. states of Minnesota, California, and Wisconsin. There are presently only a couple of Hmong families living at Wat Tham Krabok.
Wat Tham Krabok was believed to have served as a possible center of armed resistance to the Lao government with a limited number of weapons allegedly smuggled to some Hmong and Laotian insurgents and opposition groups in Laos. Responding to these concerns, the Thai military deployed hundreds of troops to surround Wat Tham Krabok in April 2003. This action was undertaken despite elements of the Thai military—many of whose officers were sympathetic to the Laotian and Hmong dissidents, insurgents and resistance fighter groups—allegedly, continuing to actively help to provide weapons and logistical support to Laotian and Hmong groups in Laos who oppose the communist government in Vientiane. The Thai military and police fenced in the Hmong at Wat Tham Krabok with concertina wire in an effort to monitor and control entrance to it, before they were able to immigrate to the US in 2004 and 2005. The area is no longer fenced. Wat Tham Krabok&#x27;s role as an alleged conduit for weapons and military support to Lao and Hmong military insurgents and dissident groups ended at Wat Tham Krabok and elsewhere in Thailand.

Wat Tham Krabok became an official &quot;wat&quot; (temple) in 2012. Vichien Gitiwanno (Luang Por Vichien) was named the first abbot of Wat Tham Krabok as an official temple recognized by the Thai government. The number of detox patients reached to 110,312 by the end of 2015.

<doc id="743794" wikidata="Q2926531" url="?curid=743794" title="Chartjunk">
<text>Chartjunk consists of all visual elements in charts and graphs that are not necessary to comprehend the information represented on the graph, or that distract the viewer from this information.

Markings and visual elements can be called chartjunk if they are not part of the minimum set of visuals necessary to communicate the information understandably. Examples of unnecessary elements that might be called chartjunk include heavy or dark grid lines, unnecessary text, inappropriately complex or gimmicky font faces, ornamented chart axes, and display frames, pictures, backgrounds or icons within data graphs, ornamental shading and unnecessary dimensions.

Another kind of chartjunk skews the depiction and makes it difficult to understand the real data being displayed. Examples of this type include items depicted out of scale to one another, noisy backgrounds making comparison between elements difficult in a chart or graph, and 3-D simulations in line and bar charts.
The term &quot;chartjunk&quot; was coined by Edward Tufte in his 1983 book &quot;The Visual Display of Quantitative Information&quot;. Tufte wrote:

The term is relatively recent and is often associated with Tufte in other references.

The concept is analogous to Adolf Loos&#x27;s idea that ornament is a crime.

== Etymology ==
The term chartjunk was first coined by Edward Tufte in 1983. The book was developed based on ideas and materials developed for a Princeton statistics course that Tufte co-taught with John Tukey. As a self-published book, &quot;The Visual Display of Quantitative Information,&quot; Tufte claims that good design is founded in minimalist design principles. Specifically, he states that &quot;graphics reveal data&quot; if they are designed with &quot;graphical integrity.&quot; Tufte, through minimalist design principles, was committed to an objective and neutral values of science. Other researchers have argued that minimalism is not objective and is full of its own rhetoric and potential to bias.

Tufte, in coining the term chartjunk, also made direct comments about a well-known designer at that time, Nigel Holmes. Nearly all those who produce graphics for mass publication are trained exclusively in the fine arts and have had little experience with the analysis of data. Such experiences are essential for achieving precision and grace in the presence of statistics... Those who get ahead are those who beautified data, never mind statistical integrity.&quot;Further, in his second published book, &quot;Envisioning Information&quot;, Tufte critiques Holmes&#x27; D&quot;iamonds&quot; chart:&quot;Consider this unsavory exhibit at right – chockablock with cliché and stereotype, coarse humor, and a content-empty third dimension... Credibility vanishes in clouds of chartjunk; who would trust a chart that looks like a video game?&quot;In a 1992 New York Times article, the reporter captures Holmes&#x27; response to Tufte&#x27;s criticism:&quot;Time&#x27;s Nigel Holmes, creator of the diamonds graph, was understandably irked when Tufte criticized it. Holmes admits his work has sometimes been exaggerated, but feels that Tufte, in his insistence on absolute mathematical fidelity, remains trapped in ’the world of academia’ and insensitive to ’the world of commerce,’ with its need to grab an audience&quot;This debate between Tufte and Holmes is emblematic of the tension between statistical and designerly approaches to visualization design.

== Debate over meaning ==
The term chartjunk is an umbrella term that can be used to describe a variety of visual devices and has been referenced by different terms across research.

Stephen Few, a data visualization practitioner and consultant at Perceptual Edge, stated that Tufte&#x27;s original definition of chartjunk was &quot;too loose&quot; and that &quot;by defining chartjunk too broadly, Tufte to some degree invited the heated controversy that has raged ever since.&quot;

Robert Kosara, also a data visualization practitioner, researcher, and author of the blog EagerEyes, noted that not all chartjunk are the same, some are harmful (e.g. a busy background), others harmless (e.g. nice borders or pictures), and some even helpful (e.g. annotations).

In a recent study by Parsons and Shukla, they interviewed data visualization designers and found that there is both a &quot;corrective movement&quot; in the design community to move away from minimalist design principles, but also, that designers had different definitions for what constitutes chartjunk. The authors felt that &quot;better definitions are needed so that everyone has a shared understanding [about chartjunk].&quot;

== Chartjunk in research ==
The information visualization research community has researched the effects of chartjunk on how viewers interpret visualizations. There have been studies that found that chartjunk increases long-term memorability of the chart. A recent study found that chartjunk, in the form of semantically meaningful icons, increased accessibility of charts for people with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD).

<doc id="743797" wikidata="Q1131020" url="?curid=743797" title="Ohio Turnpike">
<text>The Ohio Turnpike, officially the James W. Shocknessy Ohio Turnpike, is a controlled-access toll road in the U.S. state of Ohio, serving as a primary corridor between Chicago and Pittsburgh. The road runs east–west for in the northern section of the state, with the western end at the Indiana–Ohio border near Edon where it meets the Indiana Toll Road, and the eastern end at the Ohio–Pennsylvania border near Petersburg, where it meets the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The road is owned and maintained by the Ohio Turnpike and Infrastructure Commission (OTIC), headquartered in Berea.

Built from 1949 to 1955, construction for the roadway was completed a year prior to the Interstate Highway Act. The modern Ohio Turnpike is signed as three Interstate highways: I-76, I-80 and I-90.

== Route description == 
The entire length of the Ohio Turnpike is , from the western terminus in Northwest Township near Edon, where it meets the Indiana Toll Road at the Ohio–Indiana border, to the eastern terminus in Springfield Township near Petersburg where it meets the Pennsylvania Turnpike at the Ohio–Pennsylvania border. Most of the turnpike, between the Indiana border and an interchange with Interstate 76 (I-76) near Youngstown, is signed as part of I-80, while the eastern , between the I-80/I-76 interchange and the Pennsylvania border, is signed as part of I-76. For , between the Indiana border and Elyria, I-90 is cosigned with I-80 as part of the turnpike.

The Ohio Turnpike does not pass directly into any major city, but does provide access to the four major metro areas in northern Ohio through connected routes. Two auxiliary Interstate highways, I-271 near Cleveland and I-475 near Toledo, cross the turnpike, but do not have direct connections. In Northwest Ohio, the turnpike passes through the southern part of the Toledo metropolitan area, with direct access to Toledo through I-75 and I-280.

In Northeast Ohio, the turnpike passes through the southern suburbs of Greater Cleveland and the northern edge of the Akron metro area, with direct access to Cleveland via I-71, I-77, I-90 and I-480. Akron is connected to the turnpike via I-77 and State Route 8 (SR 8) in the north and I-76 on the east. The turnpike is located on the western and southern edges of the Mahoning Valley, with direct access to Youngstown through the remaining portion of I-80 east of the Turnpike, and I-680.

In North Jackson, I-80 and I-76 swap rights-of-way at a double trumpet interchange; I-76 continues east as I-80 and I-80 continues southeast as I-76, carrying the turnpike with it.
In Petersburg, the concurrent routes cross the state lines into Pennsylvania, automatically becoming the Pennsylvania Turnpike.

==History==

In 1947 a bill was introduced in the Ohio General Assembly authorizing a privately financed roadway. Originally consisting of a system of five highways, the turnpike was reduced to one when the other four were made redundant by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956. Construction for the road cost $326 million and was recorded as the biggest project in state history, with 10,000 employees, more than 2,300 bulldozers, graders, loaders and other machines over a 38-month period.

On December 1, 1954, the first stretch (the portion lying east of SR 18) opened near the present-day exit 218 for I-76 and I-80. Several motorists attended a dedication ceremony, with over 1,000 people joining a caravan, following a snow plow and a patrol cruiser, to become the first to drive the turnpike. The remaining section from exit 218 west to Indiana opened on October 1, 1955. A connecting ramp near the Indiana state line closed on August 16, 1956, the day before the Indiana Toll Road was opened; this ramp had been used to allow traffic access to US 20 to cross into Indiana. As originally built, the turnpike offered 18 access points.

The Ohio Turnpike originally had a limit for cars and limit for trucks. The automobile speed limit was increased on September 30, 1963, in concert with other Ohio rural Interstates to .

Exit 10 was rebuilt to provide access to Interstate 71 when that road was built across the turnpike. This was completed in November 1966. 

Exit 15 was rebuilt as part of construction of a new portion of interstate 80. Previously serving the surface alignment of Ohio Route 18, upon the opening of the new ramps, it would instead serve the road. Work on the new interchange was completed in 1972.

In 1974, construction was completed on exit 8A, a new interchange with Interstate 90.

In 1974,construction began on exit 16A, a new interchange to serve Interstate 680. It was completed in 1975.

The turnpike was renamed in honor of the original chairman James W. Shocknessy in 1976.

Due to the National Maximum Speed Law, a 55 mph speed limit took effect in 1974 for all vehicles. The 55 mph limit remained until 1987 when the Ohio General Assembly adopted the federally permitted 65 mph maximum speed limit, but for automobiles only.

In 1991, exit 64 was opened to serve Interstate 75.

On December 29, 1992, the unnumbered interchange at SR 49 was opened. There are no ramp tolls at this interchange; the Westgate toll barrier was, at the same time, demolished and replaced by a new Westgate Toll barrier, which is located east of SR 49.

In 1994, ticket dispencers were added to interchages in order to reduce congestion. 

Many infill interchanges were added in the 1990s. Exit 6A was opened on December 15, 1994, and exit 7A was opened the next year on December 13. This was followed by exit 3B on December 20, 1996, exit 5A on February 6, 1997, and exit 2A on November 18, 1998.

In December 2001, construction was completed to reconstruct the interchange with Brecksville Road to add new ramps to Interstate 77. The old toll plaza still exists.

The Ohio Turnpike Commission began phasing in distance-based exit numbers in 1998. In September 2002, the sequential numbering system was retired. 

Governor Taft asked the Ohio Turnpike Commission to work with ODOT and the OSHP to formulate a plan to encourage truck traffic to use the turnpike instead of parallel highways, improving the safety of those other roadways. The three organizations created a plan with three points. The truck speed limit was increased from for consistency with the automobile limits. Enforcement of truck weight and speed limits on parallel highways was increased, and truck toll rates were lowered in a trial. The speed limit increase took effect on September 8, 2004.

Exit 7B opened on November 30, 2004. It had first been proposed in 1993.

The Ohio Turnpike Commission had been hesitant to deploy an electronic tolling system, citing an apparent lack of commuter travel as well as significant implementation expenses. In December 2006, the commission indicated their intention to move forward with the implementation of an E-ZPass-compatible system as a &quot;customer convenience&quot;. The system was activated on October 1, 2009. With this, signs were added to differentiate between E-ZPass lanes and traditional manned lanes, and gates were installed to prevent motorists from evading tolls or causing accidents. They also added support for debit cards and credit cards for customers without E-ZPass, becoming the first publicly owned toll road in the U.S. (second overall) to allow users to pay tolls with a debit or credit card.

On December 20, 2010, the Ohio Turnpike Commission voted to increase the speed limit of the Ohio Turnpike to 70 mph. Despite opposition from the Ohio Trucking Association, the increase was approved by the Commission by a vote of 4–1 and went into effect on April 1, 2011.

In July 2012, the way tickets were paid for was tweaked to deter truckers from trying to evade them, which had been an issue since the road opened. They also removed manned toll lanes at the low capicity interchanges.

Ken Blackwell, the defeated candidate in the 2006 Ohio gubernatorial election, had announced a plan for privatizing the turnpike, similar to plans enacted on the Chicago Skyway and Indiana Toll Road. In 2010 and 2011, Governor John Kasich stated that he would consider a turnpike lease, but only during a prosperous economic period. In August 2011, Kasich stated his intention to create a task force to produce a leasing plan and also considered the option of reassigning the maintenance of the highway to the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT). Ultimately he decided against both, instead proposing to issue more debt under the renamed Ohio Turnpike and Infrastructure Commission, with cash tolls raised annually over a ten-year period to compensate.

A project to add one lane in each direction from Toledo to Youngstown was started in 1996, using financing from increased tolls. It was originally projected to be finished in 2005, but was not completed until the end of the 2014 construction season.

In March 2019, the turnpike commission announced plans to add high-speed E-ZPass lanes to the Westgate and Eastgate toll plazas, allowing E-ZPass users to travel through the toll areas at . Two other mainline barriers were built, and tolls ceased to be collected at exits between each respective new barrier and the nearest existing toll plaza. The construction also features new patron dynamic message signs that provide drivers with dynamic messaging. Part of the largest building program on the toll road since its original opening in 1955, the system was implemented on April 10, 2024. Driver confusion over the system prompted the OTIC to create a 60-day toll grace period on August 13, 2024. The Ohio State Highway Patrol cited in a report that a series of fatal accidents at the mainline barrier in Swanton Township on August 15, 2024, were caused in part by this confusion, and the National Transportation Safety Board has opened an investigation into them.

== Services ==

The Ohio Turnpike has had service plazas since its inception. Service plazas differ from typical freeway rest areas in that they offer amenities such as 24-hour food and fuel service; motorists do not have to pass through toll booths to re-fuel, use the restroom, or eat.

In 1998, The Ohio Turnpike Commission began modernizing its service plazas, first demolishing the original plazas and then reconstructing them from the ground up. Initially, the new plazas were rebranded by signage depicting them as &quot;travel centers&quot;, but reverted back to the original nomenclature.

In addition to modern restrooms, the new plazas offer several fast food choices, which vary between the plazas. They also include ATMs, gift shops, travel information counters, Wi-Fi internet access, and facilities for truck drivers, including shower facilities, lounge, and laundry areas. Sunoco fuel stations are provided at all service plazas along the Ohio Turnpike. The company signed a new contract to operate all 16 plazas on the Ohio Turnpike beginning in 2012. Facilities for overnight RV campers are provided at the service plazas located at mile markers 20, 76, 139, and 197.

Service plazas are located in pairs (one for each side of the turnpike) near mile markers 20, 76, 100, 139, 170, 197, and 237.

The service plazas located in Lucas County west of Toledo at mile marker 49 were the least utilized, so were closed and demolished; the Swanton toll barrier was later built at the site. A replacement pair of plazas had been planned to be built to the west in Fulton County, but ultimately were not built. Due to the lack of a municipal water/sewer system, the service plazas located near mile marker 20 in Williams County were demolished in 2006, though they were eventually rebuilt and reopened on June 29, 2011. The plazas at mile 237 - also initially fated to be closed and demolished permanently - reopened in 2013.

Since the turnpike opened, the Ohio Turnpike Commission has contracted with the Ohio State Highway Patrol (OSHP) District 10 to provide law enforcement, as well as assistance to disabled or stranded motorists. The Patrol is the only law enforcement agency with jurisdiction on the turnpike. It monitors Citizen&#x27;s Band channel 9 for distress calls.

== Tolls ==

Tolls are based upon the distance traveled, as well as the height and axle-count of vehicle driven. , the toll for a 2-axle vehicle or a motorcycle to travel the entire turnpike is $14.00 for E-ZPass holders and $20.50 for non E-ZPass holders. For purposes of toll calculation, as these barriers are not actually exits, the Westgate toll barrier is counted as exit 2 and the Eastgate toll barrier is counted as exit 239 on toll tickets.

In April 2008, Governor Ted Strickland and legislative leaders announced a planned stimulus package that would redistribute Turnpike tolls to road projects throughout the state. On May 23, the Ohio Senate Finance Committee voted to pass a new version of the package which would not involve tolls collected.

== Exit list ==
Until 1998, the turnpike numbered exits sequentially, but afterwards started the process of renumbering them by the milepost system. This was done to &quot;alleviate confusion from the irregular sequence of numerical references&quot; due to recently added interchanges as well as to conform to federal standards. The conversion ran from January 1998 to September 2002 with dually posted numbers during that period.

<text>Alan Riddell is a bilingual labour relations lawyer and partner with the law firm of Soloway Wright LLP in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. He is a graduate of the University of Toronto and France&#x27;s Institut d&#x27;etudes politiques de Paris. While still a student, he worked for Progressive Conservative Party of Canada Senator and Foreign Affairs Critic Heath MacQuarrie, and later in the office of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. As a young lawyer he successfully argued a number of high-profile cases, including the landmark decision of &quot;Dagg v. Minister of Finance&quot; in the Supreme Court of Canada, which defined the privacy rights of federal public servants under Canada&#x27;s new &quot;Access to Information Act&quot;.

== In 2004 federal election ==

In March 2004, Riddell was approached by the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) to run as its candidate in the riding of Ottawa South, which was being vacated by Deputy Prime Minister, John Manley. He handily defeated others, including former Ottawa mayoralty candidate Terry Kilrea, for the 2004 CPC nomination. In the ensuing election, he ran against two nationally known names: David McGuinty, the younger brother of Ontario Liberal Party Premier Dalton McGuinty, and Monia Mazigh, of the New Democratic Party (NDP), best known as the wife of wrongfully imprisoned Syrian-Canadian Maher Arar. Although the riding was traditionally Liberal, it was thought that Riddell&#x27;s background and dynamism, together with voter backlash against Liberal broken promises, gave him a good chance of winning.

By the middle of the campaign, Riddell began to lead McGuinty and Mazigh in the polls, and many believed he would score an upset victory over the Liberals. In the final days of the campaign, however, urban voters across Ontario shifted away from the Conservatives, thereby ensuring reelection of the Liberal government. In addition, only a few days prior to the vote, the &quot;Ottawa Sun&quot; published a damaging front-page story about Riddell, that was later retracted as inaccurate. Despite this erroneous news story, and the last minute shift in voter support, Riddell finished the election with more than 20,600 votes, the highest number ever recorded by a Conservative candidate in the riding&#x27;s history, thereby finishing a relatively close second to McGuinty.

After the election was over, the &quot;Ottawa Sun&quot; published a prominent retraction of its erroneous front-page story about Riddell and expressed regret at &quot;the resulting prejudice to his campaign&quot;.

== In 2006 federal election ==

In May 2005, when it appeared that the Liberal government was about to be defeated and another election called, Riddell was recruited to run in Ottawa South a second time. In reaction to rumours that he had once worn a World War II German officer&#x27;s costume to a campus costume party, as a teenage Halloween prank 28 years earlier, Conservative officials initially blocked Riddell&#x27;s renomination as the Party&#x27;s candidate. Riddell&#x27;s disqualification caused a public outcry from Riddell&#x27;s supporters across Ottawa, and was quickly assessed by the Conservative Party&#x27;s National Arbitration Committee.

In August, 2005, the Conservative party arbitration committee overturned that decision after finding that Mr. Riddell had worn a Sgt. Shultz uniform from the TV show Hogan&#x27;s Heroes as a prank 25 years ago, and should not be barred for a &quot;youthful indiscretion&quot;. This was issued as a binding directive to Party officials, permitting him to be the party&#x27;s candidate in Ottawa South a second time.

Only three days prior to the 2006 election, which the Conservative Party hoped to win by focusing voter attention on the Liberal government&#x27;s sponsorship scandal, Riddell stepped aside as the Party&#x27;s candidate to enable Allan Cutler, the public servant who had blown the whistle on the scandal, to run in his stead in Ottawa South. Party officials issued a Press release thanking Riddell for his gesture and confirming that the Party &quot;looked forward to having him run as its candidate in future elections&quot;. To compensate Riddell for relinquishing the nomination to Cutler, in a move designed to help them win the national campaign, they undertook to repay him his campaign expenses, pursuant to an agreement which Party Executive Director Michael Donison described in writing as legally &quot;binding&quot;. Although Elections Canada later ruled the agreement to be legal, when news of the Party&#x27;s agreement surfaced in the press, senior Party officials, including Party Leader Stephen Harper, publicly denied its existence.

After the Conservative victory in the election, Conservative Party officials refused to honour the agreement, and Riddell was
eventually forced to apply to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for a Court Order that it be implemented.

On January 11, 2007, after a two-day court hearing, Judge Denis Power of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice issued a decision confirming that the Party&#x27;s agreement with Riddell was legally binding, and ordering it to immediately pay Riddell. The Judge ruled that when Riddell had stepped aside for Cutler, he had been &quot;the preferred choice of the clear majority&quot; and that &quot;the evidence, taken as whole, clearly establishes that an agreement was reached&quot;. He concluded that &quot;the crux of the agreement was that Mr. Riddell, the leading contender for the nomination, agreed to voluntarily step aside in favour of Allan Cutler in exchange for which he was to receive some financial compensation for expenses incurred by him in seeking the nomination&quot;.

In a news article reporting on this Ontario Superior Court decision, Riddell was quoted as saying that he &quot;remained a loyal Conservative&quot; and that he intended to run again as a candidate for the Party some day.

In November 2007, Riddell, the Conservative Party and the Prime Minister quietly settled the case. The settlement was announced by a one-sentence joint news release by the Conservative Party and Alan Riddell, issued on an early Saturday morning: &quot;The Conservative Party of Canada and Alan Riddell announce they have mutually settled all legal proceedings brought by Mr. Riddell against the Conservative Party of Canada and Conservative party officials.&quot;

<text>Altai () is a set of Turkic languages spoken officially in the Altai Republic, Russia. The standard vocabulary is based on the Southern Altai language, though it is also taught to and used by speakers of the Northern Altai language as well. Gorno–Altai refers to a subgroup of languages in the Altai Mountains. The languages were called Oyrot (ойрот) prior to 1948.

Altai is spoken primarily in the Altai Republic. There is a small community of speakers in the neighbouring Altai Krai as well.

==Classification==
Due to its isolated position in the Altai Mountains and contact with surrounding languages, the exact classification of Altai within the Turkic languages has often been disputed. Because of its geographic proximity to the Shor and Khakas languages, some classifications place it in a Northern Turkic subgroup.
Due to certain similarities with Kyrgyz, it has been grouped as the Kyrgyz–Kipchak subgroup with the Kypchak languages which is within the Turkic language family. A classification by Talat Tekin places Southern Altai in its own subgroup within Turkic and groups the Northern Altai dialects with Lower Chulym and the Kondoma dialect of Shor.

=== Varieties ===
Though they are traditionally considered one language, Southern Altai is not fully mutually intelligible with the Northern varieties. According to modern classifications—at least since the middle of the 20th century—they are considered to be two separate languages.

 In 2006, a Cyrillic alphabet was created for the Kumandy variety of Northern Altai for use in Altai Krai.
Dialects are as follows:

*Southern Altai
**Altai proper
***Mayma
**Telengit
***Tölös
***Chuy
**Teleut
*Northern Altai
**Tuba
**Kumandy
***Turachak
***Solton
***Starobardinian
**Chalkan (also called Kuu, Lebedin)

Closely related to the northern varieties are Kondoma Shor and Lower Chulym, which have -j- for proto-Turkic inter-vocalic *d, unlike Mras Shor and Middle Chulym, which have -z- and are closer to Khakas.

==Official status==

Altai is an official language of the Altai Republic, alongside Russian. The official Altai language is based on the Southern Altai language spoken by the group called the Altay-Kiži, however in the few years it has also spread to the Northern Altai Republic.

== Linguistic features ==
The following features refer to the outcome of commonly used Turkic isoglosses in Northern Altai.

* */ag/ — Proto-Turkic */ag/ is found in three variations throughout Northern Altai: /u/, /aw/, /aʁ/.
* */eb/ — Proto-Turkic */eb/ is found as either /yj/ or /yg/, depending on the variety.
* */VdV/ — With a few lexical exceptions (likely borrowings), proto-Turkic intervocalic */d/ results in /j/.

==Phonology==
The sounds of the Altai language vary among different dialects.

===Consonants===
The voiced palatal plosive varies greatly from dialect to dialect, especially in the initial position, and may be recognized as a voiced affricate . Forms of the word &quot;јок&quot; &quot;no&quot; include (Kuu dialect) and (Kumandy). Even within dialects, this phoneme varies greatly.

===Vowels===
There are eight vowels in Altai. These vowels may be long or short.

== Orthography ==
The language was written with the Latin script from 1928 to 1938, but has used Cyrillic (with the addition of 9 extra letters: Јј , Ҥҥ , Ӧӧ , Ӱӱ , Ғғ , Ққ , Һһ , Ҹҹ , Ii ) since 1938.

The letter Ÿ is sometimes used instead of Ӱ.

=== Missionary&#x27;s Cyrillic alphabet ===
The first writing system for Altai was invented by missionaries from the Altai Spiritual Mission in the 1840s; it was based on the Cyrillic alphabet and invented for the Teleut dialect and was used mostly for Church publications. The first books were printed in Altai not long thereafter and in 1868, the first Altai alphabet was published. There was no stable form of this alphabet, and it changed from edition-to-edition.

With this in mind, this is an inventory of some of these letters:
=== First Cyrillic alphabet (1922–1928) ===
After the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, publishing books into Altai was resumed in 1921, using a script similar to the Missionary&#x27;s Alphabet. About this time, many post-revolution letters were adopted to better compose Russian words adopted into the language. As such, it took on this form (non-Russian letters bolded):

Interestingly, in the same space, many considered adapting the old Mongolian script for use in writing Altai.

=== Latin alphabet (1928–1938) ===
The Latin alphabet was eventually adopted and was used from 1922 to 1928. The final version of this alphabet was published in 1931, taking this form: 

The Latin letters correspond as follows to the modern Cyrillic letters:
=== Second Cyrillic alphabet (1938–1944) ===
In 1938, the &quot;Central Research Institute of Language and Writing of the Peoples of the USSR&quot; began the project of designing a new alphabet for Altai, based on the Cyrillic script. Their new alphabet consisted of all 33 Russian letters, as well as the digraph and the letter , for the phonemes /d͡ʒ/ and /ŋ/ respectively. However, this was later rejected, because it could not accurately represent all of Altai&#x27;s phonological inventory.

To amend for this, the Institute&#x27;s first revised alphabet saw the graphemes and for Altai&#x27;s vowels and fall out of use, and the addition of two digraphs and two letters: for /d͡ʒ/, for /ŋ/, for /ø~œ/, and for /y/. In the second revision, however, was replaced with . Thus was created:

Altai speakers accepted the first variant, but generally preferred over .
=== Modern Standard Altai alphabet ===
Their second Cyrillic alphabet had many shortcomings, thus begging for a reform, which was carried out in 1944. The usage of and and was dropped entirely, being replaced by the adoption of the Institute&#x27;s second revision&#x27;s usages of &#x27;, and &#x27;, for native words. was dropped in favour of &#x27;; for , they finally accepted &#x27;.

The letters , , and are still used, though they are reserved for only non-native, Russian loan-words. So, in modern Standard Altai, the equivalent sounds are written as &#x27;, &#x27; and &#x27;, for native words. So, words that were written as &#x27;cliff, rock&#x27; and &#x27;hare&#x27; are now written as &#x27; and respectively&quot;.&quot;

== Morphology and syntax ==

=== Pronouns ===

Altai has six personal pronouns:
The declension of the pronouns is outlined in the following chart. 

Pronouns in the various dialects vary considerably. For example, the pronouns in the Qumandin dialect follow.

== Sample text ==

=== Latin script version (with Common Turkic alphabet) ===
