<text>The Hanoverian or  is a German breed or stud-book of warmblood sport horse. As with other German warmblood breeds, eligibility for registration depends on performance rather than ancestry.

== History ==

In 1735, George II, the King of England and Elector of Hanover, founded the State Stud at Celle. He purchased stallions suitable for all-purpose work in agriculture and in harness, as well as for breeding cavalry mounts. The local mares were refined with Holsteiner, Thoroughbred and Cleveland Bay, Neapolitan, Andalusian, Prussian, and Mecklenburg stock. By the end of the 18th century, the Hanoverian had become a high-class coach horse.

In 1844, a law was passed that allowed only stallions approved by a commission to be used for the purpose of breeding. In 1867, breeders started a society aimed at producing a coach and military horse, with the first stud book being published in 1888. The Hanoverian became one of the most popular breeds in Europe for coach and army work.

When the demand for Hanoverians declined following World War I, the aim for breeding became a horse that could be used for farm work, but still had the blood and gaits to be used as a riding and carriage horse. After World War II, there was a growing demand for sport horses, as well as general riding horses, and the breeding yet again was adapted. Thoroughbreds were used to refine the breed; occasionally an Anglo-Arabian or Trakehner stallion was used.

== Characteristics ==

Hanoverians are elegant, strong, and robust. They are bred to be willing and trainable, and have a strong back, powerful body, athletic movement, and strong limbs. Chestnut, bay, black, and gray are found the most often. Regulations prohibit horses with too much white, and buckskin, palomino and cremello horses from being registered. There is no height requirement, but Hanoverian horses are generally high.

In order to be incorporated into the studbook, stallions and mares must pass rigorous testing. The goal of this testing is to prevent horses with heritable defects from continuing to pass on their genes. As a result, horses with the Hanoverian brand often have excellent health. The Hanoverian verband, and other warmblood breeding societies, continue to promote research into the health of their horses.

Poor fertility in Hanoverian stallions and mares is not very common. However, research on Hanoverian stallions has helped lead to the identification of new genes that affect stallion fertility.

Some of Hanoverians have symptoms of osteochondrosis dissecans in the hock joint, and some in a fetlock joint.

== Use ==

Hanoverians are consistently rated high against other sport horse breeds in dressage, show jumping and eventing.

The World Breeding Federation for Sport Horses (WBFSH) uses results from FEI-recognized competitions to rank individual horses and breed registries for each discipline. In 2008, the Hanoverian stallion Weltmeyer was the world&#x27;s #3 sire of WBFSH dressage horses, behind #2 Donnerhall, who was sired by the Hanoverian Donnerwetter. As of 2008, the Hanoverian Society had been consistently ranked in the top five most successful studbooks in international show jumping competition as ranked by the WBFSH and FEI since 2001. In 2008, the WBFSH ranked the Hanoverian studbook third for eventing horses, behind the Irish Sport Horse and Selle Français.

In 2016, the Hanoverian studbook took top position in the FEI/WBFSH studbook rankings for dressage.

The 2023 studbook rankings placed the Hanoverian studbook third in dressage, eighth in show jumping, and seventh in eventing.

In 2008, four Hanoverian sires were ranked in the top 10 show hunters: All the Gold (2), Rio Grande (4), Escudo I (5) and Espri (8).

== Breed societies ==

The first studbook—official documentation of pedigrees, matings, and ensuing offspring—for Hanoverians was founded in 1888 by the Royal Agricultural Society. The &quot;Hanoverian Warmblood studbook&quot; was kept by the Chamber of Agriculture from 1899 until 1922, when the Society of Hanoverian Warmblood Breeders was founded, privatizing ownership of the studbook. This society unified over 50 local breeders&#x27; clubs with a total of over 10,000 members. Today, this society is known simply as the &quot;Hannoveraner verband&quot;, or Hanoverian Society. The &quot;verband&quot; maintains the studbooks, issues passports, and collects and publishes performance statistics, while educating members about and encouraging research into all aspects of breeding and keeping healthy Hanoverians.

The Association for the Promotion of Hanoverian horses in Equestrian Sport (&quot;Verein zur Förderung des Reitsports auf Hannoverschen Pferden&quot;) was founded in 1985 and operates under the &quot;verband&quot;. Its goal is to unite sponsors, corporate or otherwise, and talented riders with the most gifted Hanoverian horses. In this way, the FRH removes the most common obstacle to a horse&#x27;s success: expense. Horses united with their riders in this fashion bear the initials &quot;FRH&quot; as a suffix or prefix, e.g. Gigolo FRH, FRH Butts Abraxxas, Forsyth FRH.

The popularity of the Hanoverian has brought about a number of affiliated societies as Hanoverian horses began to reach the Americas, Australia and New Zealand in the 1970s. The American Hanoverian Society was founded in 1978. A single society first served Australia and New Zealand in 1981; the two nations have had separate societies since 1993. There are two Hanoverian breeding clubs in Canada, in addition to groups in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Finland, France, and Russia.

==&quot;Verband&quot; activities==
The &quot;verband&quot; is responsible for many events and facilities related to the Hanoverian horse, including selection procedures for breeding stock and the famous Elite Auctions in Verden. The &quot;verband&quot; also owns the Hanoverian Riding and Driving School which trains riders, instructors, and horses.

===Auctions===

The auctions in Verden were first held in 1949, and have been held at the Niedersachsenhalle venue since 1972. There are at least ten auctions per year, each featuring top-quality riding horses, promising foals, proven broodmares, or licensed stallions. The most famous of these sales are the Elite Riding Horse Auctions held in April and October each year. World Cup winners such as Aramis, Mr. T and Walk on Top were Verden Elite Auction horses. Horses are delivered to the venue four weeks prior to the auction for training, promotion, and thorough screening for radiographic irregularities and vices. Price toppers routinely sell for well over €100,000 (Euros). The record price of €900,000—approximately equal to $1,125,000 at the time—was set in 2008 for the purchase of Lemony&#x27;s Nicket.

===Mare and foal shows===

The many steps and careful evaluations of Hanoverian breeding stock are organized by the &quot;verband&quot; and district breeders&#x27; clubs (&quot;bezirkverband&quot;). The district clubs are primarily responsible for local mare and foal shows. Foals of that year are presented, usually at their dam&#x27;s side, to a panel of licensed breed judges. Foals of acceptable quality are branded, their papers are signed, and they are entered into the foal registry. Judges also use this venue to recommend exceptional foals for stallion candidacy or auction participation. Mares return to the mare shows as three-year-olds to be evaluated for entry into the studbook; only such mares can have registered Hanoverian foals. The young mares are evaluated on their conformation and gaits to ensure that they are of sufficient quality. Another component of the mare shows is the field test, in which young mares are evaluated for their suitability for and age-appropriate competency in dressage and show jumping. The majority of young mares participate in the field test or station test for mares, as proof of performance is required for the mother of any stallion candidate, as well as for the State&#x27;s Premium. The best mares are awarded the State&#x27;s Premium (&quot;Staatspraemie&quot;), a monetary prize provided by the government of Lower Saxony aimed at keeping the finest mares in the local breeding population. Every other year, one of the seven district breeders&#x27; clubs hosts the Louis Wiegels show. The best three- and four-year-old mares from each district attend, and to win is a great honor. Alternating years with the Louis Wiegels Mare show, the &quot;verband&quot; hosts the Herwert von der Decken mare show in Verden.

===Breeding stock selection events===

Each year, the seven regional clubs nominate a total of 700 two-year-old colts as stallion candidates, of which only 100 attend the actual licensing (&quot;koerung&quot;) at Verden in October. A panel of &quot;verband&quot;-selected judges, experts in their fields, form the &quot;koerkommission&quot;, which evaluates each young stallion for his suitability as a sire of future Hanoverians. Through a veterinary exam, the colts must be deemed free of osteochondrosis lesions, vices, and other heritable conditions. They are then assessed on pavement to ensure that they have sound, straight, true gaits, as well as straight, sound legs. On the second day, the colts are judged on the suitability of their gaits for dressage, and their competency in jumping. On the third day, about half of the young stallions will have earned their temporary breeding license, while the other half are typically castrated and go on to become excellent riding horses. What follows the announcement of licensed stallions is the Stallion Sale, an auction which featured Hotline in 2005, who sold for a staggering €800,000.

The Hanoverian Society also organizes the Station Tests for mares. These four-week-long tests are a more in-depth evaluation of a mare&#x27;s suitability for riding; in addition to her talents for dressage or show jumping, the judges can form an understanding of her character and temperament, including how easy she is to train. These tests are held at the Hanoverian Riding and Driving School in Verden and at the Hessen State Stud in Dillenburg. After young stallions have earned their temporary license, they have until they are four years old to prove themselves serviceable riding horses. The most common track is to send the stallion to a Stallion Performance Test (&quot;Hengstleistungsprüfung&quot;) at the test center in Adelheidsdorf. As an outpost of Celle State Stud, the test center, unlike the Riding and Driving School, is owned by the state. Management of the 11-month test for state-owned stallions and the 70-day test for privately owned stallions is shared between the government-owned State Stud and the privately owned Hanoverian Society.

<doc id="732162" wikidata="Q1052401" url="?curid=732162" title="Circular wing">
<text>A circular wing is a disc-shaped wing having the outer planform of a circle.

If the aircraft has no fuselage or tail the disc-shaped craft is sometimes described as a &quot;flying saucer&quot;. If the entire disc rotates it is called a &quot;disc wing&quot;.

Disc-shaped aircraft development dates back to before World War II. A number of disc-shaped aircraft have been proposed over the years, and a few have been built.

==Circular wing aircraft==
===Nemeth Umbrella Plane===

In 1934, at Miami University (of Ohio), an aircraft called the Nemeth Umbrella Plane (aka Roundwing) was tested. (&quot;Nemeth&quot; is sometimes spelled &quot;Nuneth&quot;.) This aircraft had a parasol wing of circular form above a conventional fuselage and tail, and it was powered by propeller in a tractor configuration.

===Sack AS.6===
During World War II, a number of disc-shaped aircraft were proposed by aircraft designers in Germany. One of the few to make it further than the drawing board was the Sack AS-6, an experimental light plane with a round-winged planform that first flew in 1944. The aircraft proved unsuccessful, and was scrapped in early 1945.

===Vought Flying Flapjack===

During WWII, Charles H. Zimmerman led a team at Chance-Vought that created a series of designs that eventually resulted in the Vought Flying Flapjack, one of the first aircraft explicitly designed as a disc for aerodynamic reasons. The Flapjack had a large wing and very low wing loading, allowing it to take off easily from aircraft carriers. As with the earlier Vought V-173, the Flapjack&#x27;s counter-rotating propellers were located at the ends of the wings to help counteract the drag-inducing vortices that would normally result from a wing of such a low aspect ratio. By the time the design was flying in the post-war era, jet engines had rendered the design obsolete and the US Navy lost interest.
In 1943, Boeing Aircraft built 3 scale model aircraft whose designs had saucer-shaped wings with a propeller in the front, and a rudder in the back. The cockpit was to be in front of the wings. There was no actual fuselage in the center. The aircraft model numbers were 390, 391, and 396. They were to be powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360-3 Wasp Major radial engine and capable of reaching speeds of 414 mph. They were intended to be fighter planes, armed with 4 20mm cannons and underwing hardpoints that could carry bombs or external fuel tanks. Boeing submitted the proposals to the US Navy. The wing design had excellent short takeoff and landing (STOL) characteristics, that is preferred for fixed-wing aircraft carrier planes. The Navy rejected the Boeing designs in favor of the similar-shaped Chance-Vought V-173/XF5U-1 aircraft.

==Circular flying wings (flying saucers)==
===Avrocar===
After the war, the Avro Canada company developed a saucer-shaped aircraft. John Frost became interested in the Coandă effect to produce lift, eventually designing a disc-shape in which the thrust was directed downward around the entire disc by a flap ringing the aircraft, allowing it to take off and land vertically. Once in flight, the flap would be angled slightly, producing a small thrust while being directed to the rear. Little lift would be generated by conventional means; the engine thus would instead be used to build an &quot;artificial wing&quot; by directing the airflow around the craft. He offered a number of increasingly dramatic performance estimates, generally claiming Mach 4 performance at , at which point the USAF took over funding under &quot;Weapon System 606A&quot;. The result was a 29-foot (8.9 m) diameter supersonic &quot;Project Y2&quot;.

Testing soon revealed that the entire concept was unworkable; the craft would be highly unstable at supersonic speed. Avro nevertheless continued work on the project as a subsonic design known as &quot;Project Silver Bug&quot;. Silver Bug was of interest to the US Army, who was looking into solutions for battlefield transport and support, and they took over most of the project funding. The final outcome of Silver Bug was the Avrocar or &quot;VZ-9AV&quot;, effectively (and unintentionally) a prototype hovercraft rather than an aircraft, which was made public in 1961.

===Lenticular missiles===
From the late 1950s the USA studied lenticular-shaped unmanned vehicles. These included the Lenticular Defense Missile (LDM) Pye Wacket and the nuclear bomb delivery Lenticular Reentry Vehicle.

===Moller M200G Volantor===
The M200G Volantor is a prototype flying saucer-style hovercraft, designed by aeronautics engineer Paul Moller. The M200G Volantor uses a system of eight computer-controlled ducted fans to hover up to above the ground. Volantor is a term coined by Moller meaning &quot;a vertical takeoff and landing aircraft&quot;.

==Disc wing==

A disc wing is a circular wing that spins. It is mostly used for flying disc toys.

<text>The Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), formerly the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (SIAI), is a non-profit research institute focused since 2005 on identifying and managing potential existential risks from artificial general intelligence. MIRI&#x27;s work has focused on a friendly AI approach to system design and on predicting the rate of technology development.

==History==

In 2000, Eliezer Yudkowsky founded the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence with funding from Brian and Sabine Atkins, with the purpose of accelerating the development of artificial intelligence (AI). However, Yudkowsky began to be concerned that AI systems developed in the future could become superintelligent and pose risks to humanity, and in 2005 the institute moved to Silicon Valley and began to focus on ways to identify and manage those risks, which were at the time largely ignored by scientists in the field. 

Starting in 2006, the Institute organized the Singularity Summit to discuss the future of AI including its risks, initially in cooperation with Stanford University and with funding from Peter Thiel. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; described the first conference as a &quot;Bay Area coming-out party for the tech-inspired philosophy called transhumanism&quot;. In 2011, its offices were four apartments in downtown Berkeley. In December 2012, the institute sold its name, web domain, and the Singularity Summit to Singularity University, and in the following month took the name &quot;Machine Intelligence Research Institute&quot;.

In 2014 and 2015, public and scientific interest in the risks of AI grew, increasing donations to fund research at MIRI and similar organizations.

In 2019, Open Philanthropy recommended a general-support grant of approximately $2.1 million over two years to MIRI. In April 2020, Open Philanthropy supplemented this with a $7.7M grant over two years.

In 2021, Vitalik Buterin donated several million dollars worth of Ethereum to MIRI.

==Research and approach==
MIRI&#x27;s approach to identifying and managing the risks of AI, led by Yudkowsky, primarily addresses how to design friendly AI, covering both the initial design of AI systems and the creation of mechanisms to ensure that evolving AI systems remain friendly. 

MIRI researchers advocate early safety work as a precautionary measure. However, MIRI researchers have expressed skepticism about the views of singularity advocates like Ray Kurzweil that superintelligence is &quot;just around the corner&quot;. MIRI has funded forecasting work through an initiative called AI Impacts, which studies historical instances of discontinuous technological change, and has developed new measures of the relative computational power of humans and computer hardware.

MIRI aligns itself with the principles and objectives of the effective altruism movement.

<text>Tlaltizapán de Zapata is a city in the Mexican state of Morelos.

The city serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality, with which it shares a name. The toponym &quot;Tlaltizapán&quot; comes from a Nahuatl name and means &quot;tlal-tli&quot; (land), &quot;tiza-tl&quot; (white powder), &quot;pan&quot; (&quot;on&quot; or &quot;over&quot;); &quot;on white land&quot; or &quot;feet on white land&quot;. The city is situated on a white hill. De Zapata pays homage to the hero of the Liberation Army of the South during the Mexican Revolution.

The Municipality of Tlaltizapán de Zapata borders the Municipalities of Emiliano Zapata, Morelos; Yautepec de Zaragoza; and Ciudad Ayala to the north; the Municipalities of Ayala and Tlaquiltenango to the south; Ayala to the east; and Tlaquiltenango, Jojutla, Zacatepec de Hidalgo, Puente de Ixtla, Xochitepec. and Emiliano Zapata to the west. The municipal seat is located at an altitude of 950 meters above sea level.

The municipality reported 52,110 inhabitants in the year 2015 census.

==History==
===Prehispanic history===
Early settlers in Tlaltizapán were Xochimilcas; they founded the towns of &quot;Tetela, Hueyapan, Ocuituco, Tepoztlán&quot;, and &quot;Totolapan&quot; where they mixed with even older settlers of &quot;Jumiltepec&quot; and &quot;Nepopolco&quot;. During the Prehispanic era, these people were subjects of and paid tribute to the Aztecs of the Valley of Mexico.

===Conquest and colonial era===
During the colonial era, Tlaltizapán, like most of the state of Morelos, became part of the &quot;Marquesado del Valle de Oaxaca&quot;, of the conquistador Hernán Cortés. During the Marquesado period, Tlaltizapán was a horse farm established in 1549, managed by Pablo de Paz.

The Dominicans built the monastery of Tlaltizapán around 1550 CE. &quot;Gerhaed&quot; dates the monastery to 1591, disagreeing with both the 1576 date on the façade and a possible date of 1540. Perhaps the differences can be explained by considering the existence of two monasteries; the first related to the chapel of the Indians and the second to the cloister courtyard of the current monastery.

There are ruins of chapels of abandoned Indians, indicative of the congregation in the 17th century. There are indications that Indigenous health traditions were persecuted by the Church; we can point to the banks of the Yautepec River as an area of healers. Towards the east, there were important Indigenous settlements like &quot;San Pablo de Nexpa&quot; 

===Independence and 19th century===
The hero the Mexican War of Independence, Francisco Ayala, was captured at the &quot;Temilpa ranch&quot;, located in this municipality. Ayala had become seriously ill with malaria, and he was captured and taken to Yautepec, where he was shot in 1812. The ranch has been in ruins since then.

When the state of Morelos was created in 1869, Tlaltizapán was elevated to the category of municipality.

===Revolution and 20th century===
On Monday, June 2, 1916, during the Mexican Revolution, General Emiliano Zapata established his headquarters in Tlaltizapán in order to fight Carrancista troops. The barracks have long been torn down, but visitors can still see the former mill, turned into army headquarters. The fighting hit Tlaltizapán hard; 60% of the population were killed or fled—the population dropped from 8,000 residents in 1910 to 3,200 in 1921. Carrancista soldiers slaughtered 280 men, women, and children on June 2, 1916, and another 250 on August 13 of the same year. Similar massacres may have occurred in June and September 1916. When the Spanish flu epidemic broke out in 1918, Carrancista soldiers circled the town and would not allow the Mexican Red Cross enter.

On May 9, 1983, the State Congress changed the name of the municipality to Tlaltizapán de Pacheco in honor of former Governor Carlos Pacheco (1876-1880).

===21st century===
Alfredo Dominguez Mandujano of &quot;Juntos por Morelos&quot; (Together for Morelos coalition: PRD-PSD) was elected Presidente Municipal (mayor) on July 1, 2018.

The state of Morelos reported 209 cases and 28 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico as of April 27, 2020; four cases were reported in Amacuzac. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. On July 2, Tlatltizapán reported 18 infections and three deaths from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. Tlaltizapán reported 122 cases, 88 recuperations, and 31 deaths from the virus as of August 31. Two hundred eighteen cases were reported on December 27, 2020.

==Tourism and attractions==

There are several haciendas in Tlaltizapán. &quot;San Miguel Treinta&quot; was built in 1732 por José Francisco de Verástegui. De Verastegui also owned &quot;Santa Rosa Treinta&quot;; only 23 hectares are left of these once-powerful haciendas. The church of San Miguel still functions and is open to the public, and there are large festivals held in the saint&#x27;s honor. &quot;San José de Acamilpa&quot; was founded 1604 by the &quot;Colegio de Cristo&quot; and was once a major producer of sugarcane. In 1855 produced 2,400 barrels of schnapps. Today it is a resort hotel. Other haciendas are &quot;Ticumán, San Francisco,&quot; and &quot;Xochimancas.&quot;

===San Miguel Arcangel monastery===
The monastery of San Miguel Arcangel in Tlaltizapan was built by members of the Dominican Order about 1535. The church is rectangular with a side chapel located at the cross of the church. The ceiling is simple; supported by arches and tall columns. The side chapel is notable for its octagonal cupola. The main entrance to the west is very simple. The door is tall and narrow with a half-arc; there are discrete pilasters on the sides and a simple cornice above. Above that, there is a small, pink stone window. The front does not have any decoration except for the massive buttress on the southwest and the foundations of the tower on the northwest corner. The tower is simple and austere; above it, there is a square belfry with four open windows. The second level is smaller and eight-sided, while the third level is little more than a light tower, and the fourth level is smaller still. The access door to the monastery has two beautiful arches, making it a luxurious entrance to an austere building. Located on the north side of the church, the monastery has two floors with a central patio. The rectangular atrium is surrounded by several monuments to the Mexican Revolution.

Other historical churches are &quot;San José, la Virgen de Guadalupe, San Pedro,&quot; Santo Domingo de Guzmán and Santa Rosa de Lima.

===Las Estacas===
Las Estacas Natural Reserve and Spa belongs to the state ecological reserve &quot;Sierra de Montenegro-Las Estacas&quot;. It has crystal-clear water that flows from a spring that produces 7,000 liters (247 cubic feet) / second, forming a natural diving pool that is 10,000 years old. The name is due to the fact that in the past they used to drive &quot;stakes&quot; on the river bank to control irrigation. 500 meters of the river, which forms a tributary of the Yautepec River, is inside the park.

Visitors can swim or snorkel. Camping, cabins, and a hotel are available.

It is widely believed that a Tarzan movie was filmed at &quot;Las Estacas&quot;, but the closest seems to be the 1948 production of &quot;Tarzan and the Mermaids&quot; starring Johnny Weissmuller in 1948, which was filmed in Acapulco and other locations in Mexico.

==Communities==
In accordance with the statistical data of the INEGI, the municipality has 66 localities (human settlements, which are considered up to one house), of which 39 are composed of settlements of 1 to 49 inhabitants; 11 localities have 50 to 99 inhabitants; three settlements of 100 to 499 inhabitants; five localities of 500 to 999 inhabitants; four locations from 1,000 to 1,999 inhabitants; two locations of 3,000 to 4,000 inhabitants; one of 9,893 inhabitants (the municipal seat). and the largest town in the municipality is Santa Rosa Treinta with 16,474 inhabitants.

The Municipality of Tlaltizapán has one city (the municipal seat of Tlaltizapán), four urban localities (Santa Rosa Treinta, Ticumán, Huatecalco, and Tlaltizapán), with more than 2,500 inhabitants each; four semi-urban locations (Acamilpa, Bonifacio García, Temimilcingo, and Pueblo Nuevo), which have a population range of 1,000 to 2,500 inhabitants, and 58 rural localities with fewer than 1,000 inhabitants.

<text>Cellulitis is usually a bacterial infection involving the inner layers of the skin. It specifically affects the dermis and subcutaneous fat. Signs and symptoms include an area of redness which increases in size over a few days. The borders of the area of redness are generally not sharp and the skin may be swollen. While the redness often turns white when pressure is applied, this is not always the case. The area of infection is usually painful. Lymphatic vessels may occasionally be involved, and the person may have a fever and feel tired.
The legs and face are the most common sites involved, although cellulitis can occur on any part of the body. The leg is typically affected following a break in the skin. Other risk factors include obesity, leg swelling, and old age. For facial infections, a break in the skin beforehand is not usually the case. The bacteria most commonly involved are streptococci and &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. In contrast to cellulitis, erysipelas is a bacterial infection involving the more superficial layers of the skin, present with an area of redness with well-defined edges, and more often is associated with a fever. The diagnosis is usually based on the presenting signs and symptoms, while a cell culture is rarely possible. Before making a diagnosis, more serious infections such as an underlying bone infection or necrotizing fasciitis should be ruled out.
Treatment is typically with antibiotics taken by mouth, such as cephalexin, amoxicillin or cloxacillin. Those who are allergic to penicillin may be prescribed erythromycin or clindamycin instead. When methicillin-resistant &quot;S. aureus&quot; (MRSA) is a concern, doxycycline or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole may, in addition, be recommended. There is concern related to the presence of pus or previous MRSA infections. Elevating the infected area may be useful, as may pain killers.
Potential complications include abscess formation. Around 95% of people are better after 7 to 10 days of treatment. Those with diabetes, however, often have worse outcomes. Cellulitis occurred in about 21.2 million people in 2015. In the United States about 2 of every 1,000 people per year have a case affecting the lower leg. Cellulitis in 2015 resulted in about 16,900 deaths worldwide. In the United Kingdom, cellulitis was the reason for 1.6% of admissions to a hospital.

==Signs and symptoms==
The typical signs and symptoms of cellulitis are an area that is red, hot, and painful. The photos shown here are of mild to moderate cases and are not representative of the earlier stages of the condition.

===Complications===
Potential complications may include abscess formation, fasciitis, and sepsis.

==Causes==

Cellulitis is usually, but not always, caused by bacteria that enter and infect the tissue through breaks in the skin. Group A &quot;Streptococcus&quot; and &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; are the most common causes of the infection and may be found on the skin as normal biota in healthy individuals.

About 80% of cases of Ludwig&#x27;s angina, or cellulitis of the submandibular space, are caused by dental infections. Mixed infections, due to both aerobes and anaerobes, are commonly associated with this type of cellulitis. Typically, this includes alpha-hemolytic streptococci, staphylococci, and bacteroides&#x27; groups.

Predisposing conditions for cellulitis include an insect or spider bite, blistering, an animal bite, tattoos, pruritic (itchy) skin rash, recent surgery, athlete&#x27;s foot, dry skin, eczema, injecting drugs (especially subcutaneous or intramuscular injection or where an attempted intravenous injection &quot;misses&quot; or blows the vein), pregnancy, diabetes, and obesity, which can affect circulation, as well as burns and boils, although debate exists as to whether minor foot lesions contribute. Occurrences of cellulitis may also be associated with the rare condition hidradenitis suppurativa or dissecting cellulitis.

The appearance of the skin assists a doctor in determining a diagnosis. A doctor may also suggest blood tests, a wound culture, or other tests to help rule out a blood clot deep in the veins of the legs. Cellulitis in the lower leg is characterized by signs and symptoms similar to those of a deep vein thrombosis, such as warmth, pain, and swelling (inflammation).

Reddened skin or rash may signal a deeper, more serious infection of the inner layers of skin. Once below the skin, the bacteria can spread rapidly, entering the lymph nodes and the bloodstream and spreading throughout the body. This can result in influenza-like symptoms with a high temperature and sweating or feeling very cold with shaking, as the affected person cannot get warm.

In rare cases, the infection can spread to the deep layer of tissue called the fascial lining. Necrotizing fasciitis, also called by the media &quot;flesh-eating bacteria&quot;, is an example of a deep-layer infection. It is a medical emergency.

===Risk factors===

The elderly and those with a weakened immune system are especially vulnerable to contracting cellulitis. Diabetics are more susceptible to cellulitis than the general population because of impairment of the immune system; they are especially prone to cellulitis in the feet, because the disease causes impairment of blood circulation in the legs, leading to diabetic foot or foot ulcers. Poor control of blood glucose levels allows bacteria to grow more rapidly in the affected tissue and facilitates rapid progression if the infection enters the bloodstream. Neural degeneration in diabetes means these ulcers may not be painful, thus often become infected. Those who have had poliomyelitis are also prone because of circulatory problems, especially in the legs.

Immunosuppressive drugs, and other illnesses or infections that weaken the immune system, are also factors that make infection more likely. Chickenpox and shingles often result in blisters that break open, providing a gap in the skin through which bacteria can enter. Lymphedema, which causes swelling on the arms and/or legs, can also put an individual at risk.
Diseases that affect blood circulation in the legs and feet, such as chronic venous insufficiency and varicose veins, are also risk factors for cellulitis.

Cellulitis is also common among dense populations sharing hygiene facilities and common living quarters, such as military installations, college dormitories, nursing homes, oil platforms, and homeless shelters.

==Diagnosis==
Cellulitis is most often a clinical diagnosis, readily identified in many people by history and physical examination alone, with rapidly spreading areas of cutaneous swelling, redness, and heat, occasionally associated with inflammation of regional lymph nodes. While classically distinguished as a separate entity from erysipelas by spreading more deeply to involve the subcutaneous tissues, many clinicians may classify erysipelas as cellulitis. Both are often treated similarly, but cellulitis associated with furuncles, carbuncles, or abscesses is usually caused by &quot;S. aureus&quot;, which may affect treatment decisions, especially antibiotic selection. Skin aspiration of nonpurulent cellulitis, usually caused by streptococcal organisms, is rarely helpful for diagnosis, and blood cultures are positive in fewer than 5% of all cases.

It is important to evaluate for co-existent abscess, as this finding usually requires surgical drainage as opposed to antibiotic therapy alone. Physicians&#x27; clinical assessment for abscess may be limited, especially in cases with extensive overlying induration, but use of bedside ultrasonography performed by an experienced practitioner readily discriminates between abscess and cellulitis and may change management in up to 56% of cases. Use of ultrasound for abscess identification may also be indicated in cases of antibiotic failure. Cellulitis has a characteristic &quot;cobblestoned&quot; appearance indicative of subcutaneous edema without a defined hypoechoic, heterogeneous fluid collection that would indicate abscess.

===Differential diagnosis===
Other conditions that may mimic cellulitis include deep vein thrombosis, which can be diagnosed with a compression leg ultrasound, and stasis dermatitis, which is inflammation of the skin from poor blood flow. Signs of a more severe infection such as necrotizing fasciitis or gas gangrene that would require prompt surgical intervention include purple bullae, skin sloughing, subcutaneous edema, and systemic toxicity. Misdiagnosis can occur in up to 30% of people with suspected lower-extremity cellulitis, leading to 50,000 to 130,000 unnecessary hospitalizations and $195 to $515 million in avoidable healthcare spending annually in the United States. Evaluation by dermatologists for cases of suspected cellulitis has been shown to reduce misdiagnosis rates and improve patient outcomes.

Associated musculoskeletal findings are sometimes reported. When it occurs with acne conglobata, hidradenitis suppurativa, and pilonidal cysts, the syndrome is referred to as the follicular occlusion triad or tetrad.

Lyme disease can be misdiagnosed as cellulitis. The characteristic bullseye rash does not always appear in Lyme disease (the rash may not have a central or ring-like clearing, or not appear at all). Factors supportive of Lyme include recent outdoor activities where Lyme is common and rash at an unusual site for cellulitis, such as armpit, groin, or behind the knee. Lyme can also result in long-term neurologic complications. The standard treatment for cellulitis, cephalexin, is not useful in Lyme disease. When it is unclear which one is present, the IDSA recommends treatment with cefuroxime axetil or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, as these are effective against both infections.

==Prevention==
In those who have previously had cellulitis, the use of antibiotics may help prevent future episodes. This is recommended by Clinical Resource Efficiency Support Team (CREST) for those who have had more than two episodes. A 2017 meta-analysis found a benefit of preventative antibiotics for recurrent cellulitis in the lower limbs, but the preventative effects appear to diminish after stopping antibiotic therapy.

==Treatment==
Antibiotics are usually prescribed, with the agent selected based on suspected organism and presence or absence of purulence, although the best treatment choice is unclear. If an abscess is also present, surgical drainage is usually indicated, with antibiotics often prescribed for co-existent cellulitis, especially if extensive. Pain relief is also often prescribed, but excessive pain should always be investigated, as it is a symptom of necrotizing fasciitis. Elevation of the affected area is often recommended.

Steroids may speed recovery in those on antibiotics.

===Antibiotics===
Antibiotics choices depend on regional availability, but a penicillinase-resistant semisynthetic penicillin or a first-generation cephalosporin is currently recommended for cellulitis without abscess. A course of antibiotics is not effective in between 6 and 37% of cases.

==Epidemiology==
Cellulitis in 2015 resulted in about 16,900 deaths worldwide, up from 12,600 in 2005.

Cellulitis is a common global health burden, with more than 650,000 admissions per year in the United States alone. In the United States, an estimated 14.5 million cases annually of cellulitis account for $3.7 billion in ambulatory care costs alone. The majority of cases of cellulitis are nonculturable and therefore the causative bacteria are unknown. In the 15% of cellulitis cases in which organisms are identified, most are due to β-hemolytic Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus.

==Other animals==
Horses may acquire cellulitis, usually secondarily to a wound (which can be extremely small and superficial) or to a deep-tissue infection, such as an abscess or infected bone, tendon sheath or joint. Cellulitis from a superficial wound usually creates less lameness (grade 1–2 of 5) than that caused by septic arthritis (grade 4–5). The horse exhibits inflammatory edema, which is hot, painful swelling. This swelling differs from stocking up in that the horse does not display symmetrical swelling in two or four legs, but in only one leg. This swelling begins near the source of infection, but eventually continues down the leg. In some cases, the swelling also travels distally. Treatment includes cleaning the wound and caring for it properly, the administration of NSAIDs, such as phenylbutazone, cold hosing, applying a sweat wrap or a poultice, and mild exercise.

<text>The In-Betweener is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Jim Starlin, the character first appeared in &quot;Warlock&quot; #9 (1975).

==Publication history==

The character first appeared in &quot;Warlock&quot; (1972) #9, where he viewed Thanos as a figure disrupting the natural order. This was followed by &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; (1974) #28. He then appeared in &quot;Warlock&quot; #10 (December 1975) and was created by Jim Starlin.

==Fictional character biography==
The In-Betweener is a cosmic entity who represents duality and serves fellow conceptual beings Master Order and Lord Chaos, although his loyalty is usually to himself rather than to them. Throughout his appearances, he battles Adam Warlock and Doctor Strange before being imprisoned as punishment for rebelling against his masters.

He is later freed by Thanos, who secretly desires the Soul Gem in his possession. Thanos then steals the gem and abandons the In-Betweener to face the wrath of Master Order and Lord Chaos, who discover he has escaped his prison.

The In-Betweener later appeared as a pawn of the villain Scorpio, a member of the criminal organization Zodiac. Scorpio, however, was stopped by the superhero team the Avengers and the In-Betweener was subsequently freed.

The In-Betweener also appeared in an alternate dimension of Earth-957.

In &quot;Time Runs Out&quot;, the Beyonders are revealed to have killed Order, Chaos, the In-Betweener, and other abstract entities across the multiverse. However, the In-Betweener was later revealed to be the mastermind behind Libra&#x27;s attempt at destroying Earth, and more specifically, Starbrand.

After the universe is restored, Order and Chaos kill the Living Tribunal and force the In-Betweener to fuse them into a new cosmic being named Logos who can replace him. However, they are later separated by Black Panther&#x27;s astral form.

==Powers and abilities==
As the physical embodiment of the cosmic balance between Order and Chaos, the In-Betweener can manipulate cosmic energy to alter reality to achieve nearly any effect or ability within his influence as the synthesis of duality. He is, however, under the absolute control of Master Order and Lord Chaos as his creators. The In-Betweener&#x27;s other major (and unique) ability is to analyze a target and then direct energy towards it in a &quot;polar opposite&quot; form, which is instantly fatal.

Alternatively, if he cannot personally synthesize the &quot;opposite energy&quot; necessary to eliminate an opponent, he can directly summon that enemy&#x27;s opposite being, and eliminate them that way; using the power granted to him in his station as a cosmic force, he once even summoned and forced Death itself to destroy the Elders of the Universe, even though it had, at an earlier point, refused to ever let them die again as a punishment. The In-Betweener finds that he is unable to use either of his special abilities on Galactus, however, and he believes that this is because he is Galactus&#x27;s metaphysical counterpart and opposite.

<text>Akershus Fortress (, ) or Akershus Castle ( ) is a medieval castle in the Norwegian capital Oslo that was built to protect and provide a royal residence for the city. Since the Middle Ages the fortress has been the namesake and centre of the main fief and later main county of Akershus, which was originally one of Norway&#x27;s four main regions and which included most of Eastern Norway. The fortress itself was located within the Akershus main county until 1919, and also within the smaller Akershus sub county until 1842.

The castle has also been used as a military base, a prison and is currently the temporary office of the prime minister of Norway.

==Construction==
It is not known exactly when the construction of the castle started but it is believed that it took place around the late 1290s, by King Haakon V, replacing Tønsberg as one of the two most important Norwegian castles of the period (the other being Båhus). It was constructed in response to the Norwegian nobleman, Earl Alv Erlingsson of Sarpsborg&#x27;s earlier attack on Oslo that occurred in 1287. In the aftermath of the attack, it became clear that the city&#x27;s existing defences weren&#x27;t effective and therefore, a stronger defensive centre was needed.

The castle is mentioned in written sources for the first time in 1300 in a letter from King Haakon to a church in Oslo. However, the letter does not mention how far the construction of the castle had progressed by then.

The fortress has successfully survived all sieges, primarily by Swedish forces, including those by forces led by Charles XII in 1716.

==History and military use==
=== The Middle Ages ===
The fortress was first used in battle in 1308, when it was besieged by the Swedish duke Erik Magnusson. The siege was eventually broken by a local Norwegian army in a battle. (This battle forms a major part of the plot of Sigrid Undset&#x27;s historical novel &quot;In the Wilderness&quot;, the third volume of her tetralogy &quot;The Master of Hestviken&quot;.)

=== Renaissance and Denmark-Norway ===
The immediate proximity of the sea was a key feature, for naval power was a vital military force as the majority of Norwegian commerce in that period was by sea. The fortress was strategically important for the capital, and therefore, Norway as well. Whoever controlled Akershus fortress ruled Norway.

In 1449-1450 the castle was besieged again, this time by the Swedish king Karl Knutsson Bonde, but he had to lift the siege after a while. The castle was not besieged again until 1502 when Scottish soldiers in the service of the Danish-Norwegian king besieged the castle in order to regain it from the hands of the Norwegian nobleman Knut Alvsson.

Akershus was besieged yet again in 1523, this time by Swedish soldiers but Oslo&#x27;s inhabitants, at the command of Hans Mule, burned down their houses in an attempt to drive them out and the Swedes retreated after a short period. King Christian II besieged the castle from 1531 to 1532 but the siege was lifted by forces from Denmark and Lübeck. After this siege the castle was improved and strengthened.

In 1567, during the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War, the castle was besieged once more by Swedish forces, but the Danish-Norwegian king&#x27;s lord lieutenant, Christen Munk, responded by burning down the city in order to deprive the attackers themselves of the means of receiving supplies, and eventually the Swedes retreated.

=== World War II ===
The fortress has never successfully been besieged by a foreign enemy. However it surrendered without combat to Nazi Germany in 1940 when the Norwegian government evacuated the capital in the face of the unprovoked German assault on Denmark and Norway (see Operation Weserübung).

During World War II, people were executed here by the German occupiers, including members of the Pelle group. The fortress was liberated on 11 May 1945, when it was handed over to Terje Rollem on behalf of the Norwegian resistance movement. After the war, eight Norwegian traitors who had been tried for war crimes and sentenced to death were also executed at the fortress. Among those executed were Vidkun Quisling and Siegfried Fehmer.
== Royal residence ==
=== During the Middle Ages ===
After construction of the castle was finished around 1300, Haakon V gradually started to use the castle as a residential palace, favoring the keep over the Oslo Kongsgård estate despite the fact that the castle likely was unsuited as a residence. The castle becoming a royal residence also played a significant role in the process where the capital of Norway was moved from Bergen to Oslo. Several significant figures from the Norwegian middle ages, including Haakon V, Queen Euphemia, Ingeborg Eriksdottir and Queen Margaret, all resided at the castle, which functioned as the official Norwegian royal residence for several decades. The last Norwegian king prior to the establishment of the Kalmar Union, Olaf II, was born at the castle in 1370.

=== Anne of Denmark and James VI of Scotland ===
In September 1589, Anne of Denmark tried to sail to Scotland when she was betrothed to King James VI, but after difficulties with her ships and weather, she made her way to Akershus with the Scottish Earl Marischal. After they married, when they were at Elsinore (Kronborg), a servant of Axel Gyldenstierne, captain of Akershus, was rewarded for bringing letters to the Scottish king.

=== Restoration and palace ===
Following the great fire of 1624, King Christian IV made the decision to relocate and rebuild the entire city of Oslo. The king ordered the new city to be located closer to Akershus Fortress, renaming the city &quot;Christiania&quot;. The fortress was subsequently modernized and remodeled, with the new appearance being that of a renaissance castle with Italian inspired bastions. The castle primarily functioned as a palace until the turn of the 19th century, with new towers, halls, chambers and gates being added over time.

When the king was absent, the castle functioned as the seat of the Steward of Norway.

==Prison==
Akershus has also been a prison, with a section of it known as &quot;The Slavery&quot; () because the prisoners could be rented out for work in the city. It has housed many rebels and criminals through Norwegian history. Particularly well-known people to have been imprisoned there include author Gjest Baardsen (1791–1849), and the similarly idealized thief Ole Høiland. Also, many early Norwegian socialists (supporters of Marcus Thrane, 1817–1890) also spent time in the cells of Akershus. The prison was also a plot element in the film &quot;Fante-Anne&quot; (1920).

===Kautokeino rebellion prisoners===
Following the 1852 Laestadian Sámi revolt in Guovdageaidnu, all men except the two leaders Aslak Hætta and Mons Somby (who were beheaded in Alta) ended up in Akershus Fortress – the women were imprisoned in Trondheim. Many of the rebels died after a few years in captivity. Among the survivors was Lars Hætta (18 years at the time of imprisonment), who during his stay was allowed time and means to write the first translation of the Bible into North Sámi.

==Current use==

Although still a military area, the Akershus Fortress is open to the public between 6:00 and 21:00 daily. As well as the castle, the Norwegian Armed Forces Museum and Norway&#x27;s Resistance Museum can also be visited. The Norwegian Ministry of Defence and the country&#x27;s Defence Staff Norway share a joint modern headquarters in the eastern part of the fortress. His Majesty the King&#x27;s Guard is responsible for guarding the fortress, with stationary guard posts during open hours and mobile patrols at night. One of the stationary guard posts at the entrance is a popular photography spot for tourists visiting the fortress.

=== Royal Mausoleum ===
The castle&#x27;s Royal Mausoleum is the final resting place of a number of Norwegian royal figures. This includes King Sigurd I, King Haakon V, Queen Eufemia, King Haakon VII, Queen Maud, King Olav V and Crown Princess Märtha. Since restoration of the main building, the castle has frequently been used as the venue for official events and dinners for dignitaries and foreign heads of state.

=== Office of the Prime Minister ===

After the 22 July attacks in 2011, the Office of the Norwegian prime minister has been located close to the fortress in a building that originally belonged to the Norwegian Ministry of Defence.

==Imitation==
Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida just outside Orlando in the United States replicates a portion of the fortress at the Norway Pavilion at its Epcot theme park. In a further reference to Akershus&#x27; royal history, the Epcot replication also houses a Disney Princess character restaurant called Akershus Royal Banquet Hall, which also serves some Norwegian dishes.

<text>Lionel Lukin (18 May 1742 – 16 February 1834) was a British carriage builder and inventor, noted for the invention of the &#x27;unimmergible&#x27; lifeboat.

== Private and professional life ==
Lukin was born in Great Dunmow, Essex, on 18 May 1742. He married twice. He had a son and daughter with his first wife, a Miss Walker of Bishops Stortford. His second wife was Heather Clissold of Reading.

He was apprenticed by a local coachbuilder and later established a business in Long Acre, London. He joined the Worshipful Company of Coachmakers and Coach Harness Makers and eventually became the company&#x27;s Master.

He had a house in Chelsea and retired to Hythe, Kent, where he took an active interest in matters of the church. He died on 16 February 1834 and is buried at St Leonard&#x27;s church. His gravestone is inscribed: &quot;This Lionel Lukin was the first to build a lifeboat, and the original inventor of that principle of safety by which many lives and much property have been preserved from shipwreck, and he obtained for it the King&#x27;s patent in the year 1785&quot;.

==Lifeboats==
Lukin was granted a patent on 2 November 1785 for an &#x27;unimmergible&#x27; boat. The design had increased buoyancy because of sealed air spaces along the side of the boat and in the bow and stern. This enabled it to stay afloat if swamped with water, or when carrying people rescued from the water. A heavy iron keel gave stability. These principles were used in most lifeboats built until the 1960s.

Rather than use the patent to make a profit, he published the design so that everyone could benefit from his ideas. The Royal Humane Society commended him for his &quot;very praiseworthy liberality&quot;.

===&quot;Experiment&quot;===
Lukin tried to interest the Royal Navy in his ideas without success. Instead he had a prototype converted from a yawl sailing boat which he purchased in 1784. It was about long and renamed &quot;Experiment&quot;. Lukin tested it on the River Thames and then loaned it to a pilot at Ramsgate for testing. It was reported to have crossed the English Channel several times in rough weather but was believed impounded on suspicion of being used for smuggling.

===&quot;Witch&quot;===
Lukin&#x27;s second prototype lifeboat was named &quot;Witch&quot;, a similar yawl to the &quot;Experiment&quot;. It was tested at Margate and found to sail well and impossible to sink.

===Bamburgh Castle===
A charity in Northumberland asked Lukin to design a lifeboat for them. It was based on the design for a local coble rowing boat and kept at from 1786.

===&quot;Frances Ann&quot;===
The Suffolk Humane Society approached Lukin to design another lifeboat. This was long and wide. It was used at from 1807. It was the first lifeboat placed in service that was intended to be used under sail (although it also carried 12 oars) and became to forerunner of the type that was used at many lifeboat stations on the East Coast for more than 100 years.

==Other inventions==
The lifeboat was not the only invention to come from Lukin&#x27;s fertile brain. Other ideas included a stove that could be used on a ship in rough seas, a rain gauge, an adjustable invalid&#x27;s bed that was adopted in London hospitals, and a raft that could be used to rescue people who had fallen through ice.

<doc id="732188" wikidata="Q1421272" url="?curid=732188" title="Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome">
<text>Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome is a rare complication of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) involving liver capsule inflammation leading to the formation of adhesions presenting with the clinical syndrome of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain.

== History ==
Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome, or perihepatitis, was first described by Carlos Stajano in 1920, who found adhesions between the liver capsule and the abdominal wall in patients suffering from gonococcal infections.

The condition is named after the two physicians, Thomas Fitz-Hugh Jr. and Arthur Hale Curtis, who further studied the syndrome in the 1930s. They noted the classic &quot;violin string adhesions&quot; in female patients presenting with RUQ abdominal pain. Both Fitz-Hugh and Curtis regularly found these adhesions during laparotomy in patients with the clinical syndrome of RUQ with concern for gallbladder pathology; however, no abdominal pathology was found in these patients but residual gonococcal tubal changes were often noted.

==Pathophysiology==
Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome occurs almost exclusively in women, though it can be seen in males rarely. It is complication of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) caused by &quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot; (Chlamydia) or &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot; (Gonorrhea) though other bacteria such as &quot;Bacteroides&quot;, &quot;Gardnerella&quot;, &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus&quot; have also been found to cause Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome on occasion. Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome was originally studied solely as a complication of PID secondary to Gonorrhea, but studies have now shown that Chlamydia is the most common causal pathogen. Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome occurs in 5-15% of patients with PID.

The pathogens of PID spread either spontaneous secondary to an ascending infection through the fallopian tubes, lymphatically, or hematogenous. Inflammation then causes scar tissue to form on Glisson&#x27;s capsule, a thin layer of connective tissue surrounding the liver. This inflammation and scaring then leads to the characteristic RUQ pain.

==Presentation==
The major symptom and signs include an acute onset of RUQ abdominal pain aggravated by breathing, coughing or laughing, which may also present with referred pain to the right shoulder. There is usually also tenderness on palpation of the right upper abdomen and tenderness to percussion of the lower ribs which protect the liver. Patients may also report fevers, malaise, back pain, pelvic pain, dyspareunia, vaginal discharge, and dysuria.

Patients are most often women of childbearing age. There are a number of risk factors for the development of Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome, these include having multiple sexual partners, history of sexually transmitted disease, history of PID, use of an intrauterine device, use of a vaginal douche, and being under the age of 25.

== Differential diagnosis ==
The signs and symptoms of Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome greatly overlap with numerous other abdominal and pelvic pathologies. It is important for practitioners to perform a thorough history and physical as the differential for the symptoms of Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome include cholecystitis, appendicitis, hepatitis, pregnancy, pyelonephritis, renal colic, pleuritic causes such as pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and pleurisy, among many others.

==Diagnosis and workup==
The workup for Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome at presentation begins with ruling out pregnancy or an ectopic pregnancy with a pregnancy test, this can also help guide antibiotic therapy if indicated to prevent teratogens.

Radiographic studies are often indicated to rule out other thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic pathologies. Chest and abdominal radiographs may be indicated to rule out pulmonary pathologies and to assess for free air under the diaphragm in the case of intestinal perforation. Abdominal and pelvic ultrasounds are critical to rule out common causes of RUQ pain such as cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, and abdominal/pelvic abscesses. Computed tomography (CT) scan should be obtained in the case that the clinical suspicion for appendicitis is high. In cases of Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome, the CT scan may show increased blood flow to the liver capsule secondary to the inflammation.

Liver function tests (LFTs) are often obtained is these patients as part of the initial workup, since Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome does not involve direct damage to the liver, LFTs will be normal or only slightly elevated.

After ruling out other concerning pathologies if suspicion is high, the workup for Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome involves testing for sexually transmitted diseases (Chlamydia and Gonorrhea) with nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) from a cervical swab sample. If indicated, urethral, rectal, and/or pharyngeal swabs may be obtained as well.

The gold standard for diagnosis of Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome, though rarely required, is laparoscopy with direct visualization of the characteristic &quot;violin string adhesions&quot; along with liver capsule scarring and inflammation. Antibody testing of 57-kDa chlamydial heat-shock protein can be done in cases where all other tests have been non-diagnostic and the clinical suspicion remains high.

== Treatment ==
The mainstay of treatment of Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome is antibiotics targeted at the causal organism. The CDC recommends a low threshold for treatment given the high risk of infertility and ectopic pregnancies with untreated disease. Antibiotic therapy should cover the most common pathogens including Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, other gram-negatives, and anaerobes. Current guidelines recommend ceftriaxone and azithromycin as Chlamydia and Gonorrhea constitute the vast majority of cases, treatment for complicated PID involves the combination of ceftriaxone, doxycycline, and metronidazole. In cases of refractory pain, laparoscopy may be considered for lysis of adhesions.

== Prognosis ==
With treatment, the prognosis of Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome is excellent with vast majority of patients seeing complete resolution of symptoms. Complications of the disease include infertility, small bowel obstruction due to adhesions, chronic pelvic pain, recurrent salpingitis, and ectopic pregnancy.

<doc id="732194" wikidata="Q2451592" url="?curid=732194" title="China cymbal">
<text>In western music, a China cymbal (or Chinese cymbal) is a distinct type of crash cymbal designed to produce a bright, crisp, and explosive tone that has brought it the nickname &quot;trash cymbal&quot;. The name &quot;China cymbal&quot; comes from its shape, which is similar to that of the Chinese Bo. Such cymbals are most frequently mounted upside down on cymbal stands, allowing for them to be more easily struck and for a better sound.

China-type cymbals are common in various kinds of rock music, particularly heavy metal and thrash metal. They are also frequently used in jazz fusion, Latin music, and Brazilian music, especially in arrangements with elaborate drum solos. In Latin and some other music styles, China cymbals are usually played in conjunction with other percussion instruments instead of a drum kit, such as timbales, octobans, or the surdo. China cymbals may also be used for conventional jazz, often played with mallets or brushes to achieve a softer sound resembling that of a &quot;dark crash&quot; cymbal.

Occasionally these cymbals are featured in orchestral works; examples using a suspended cymbal include Olivier Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Turangalîla-Symphonie&quot; and Edgard Varèse&#x27;s &quot;Ionisation&quot;.

==Anatomy==

China type cymbals typically have a bell that is cylindrical or shaped like a truncated cone with its base the top of the bell, an outer rim that is turned up in the reverse direction to the main bow of the cymbal, little or no taper (change in thickness) from bell to rim, and an area including the inside of the bell that is unpolished. However, many china type cymbals have only several or in some cases none of these distinguishing characteristics. The distinguishing feature of a china type cymbal is the one that is hardest to define: its sound. China cymbals are those whose sounds are derived from the Chinese, rather than the Turkish, tradition of cymbal making.

Cymbals are classified into two or three tonal families: Turkish; Chinese; and some would say European, although others would include the European family of tones as a development of the Turkish sounds. The best Turkish (and European) cymbals have a rich, swelling tone that some describe as &quot;sweet&quot;. To western ears, the best china types have an abrasive, cutting sound that is described by western drummers as &quot;trashy&quot;.

The families do to some extent overlap. Notably, pang and swish cymbals have some characteristics of china types, and some characteristics of traditional Turkish cymbals. On the other hand, the Sabian rocktagon cymbals, and some Ufip models, are considered china types while having none of the physical characteristics of the normal china type, while the Paiste crystal crash is considered a European cymbal despite its squarish bell.

Cymbal making in China is claimed to predate the development of the art anywhere else in the world. The most universally acclaimed cymbal alloy, bell bronze, appears to have been independently developed in China. Today in China a wide range of cymbals are manufactured of both traditional and imported patterns. Traditional Chinese types with distinctive names and sounds include chung, jing, and water cymbals, as well as many other types. In Western music these are all referred to as china type cymbals.

China type cymbals are available in a wide range of sizes from down to , most types singly but some in pairs. Those of or smaller are normally referred to in Western music as china splash cymbals. When used in a drum kit, they are regarded as effects cymbals and are used to give colour and variety.

In a drum kit, china-type cymbals can be mounted either with the bell facing upward (similar to other cymbals) as well as with the bell facing downward. When mounted bell-down, the upturned rim becomes a downturned rim, allowing a normal stick technique to be used for both ride and crash patterns. This assumes that the bell is formed in the typical direction; some china type cymbals (e.g., the Paiste 2002 Novo china) have an inverted bell and an upturned rim, and so must be mounted bell up to achieve this downwards rim orientation.

==Types==
===Traditional===
Conical (termed &quot;square&quot;) bell rough finished on the inside; reversed edge.

===Novo===
Conventional rounded bell, reversed edge. The bell may be or may not be reversed.

===Pang and swish===
The swish and pang are specific sounds within the enormous range of china cymbals, developed as exotic ride cymbals but also used as crashes at higher volumes.

===China splash===

A &quot;China splash&quot; cymbal is typically or smaller.

Sabian refers to both their nova Chinese models as mini Chinese.

===Rocktagon===
The &quot;Rocktagon&quot;, a Sabian exclusive, is an octagonal cymbal with a sound midway between a crash and a china. The cymbal is manufactured as round and cut to shape after all-over lathing. Available sizes include , , and initially , as well as and Rocktagon splash.

==Sticking techniques==
China cymbals are played in various ways, depending on the genre of music.

For example, in modern metal music, players generally tend to play using the shoulder of the stick rather than the tip for a more &quot;trashy&quot; sound. In other genres, such as jazz (which can use less hammered cymbals for a lighter and less distorted effect), the drummer often plays with the tip for more of a &quot;sizzle&quot; sound.

<doc id="732200" wikidata="Q36381317" url="?curid=732200" title="Selfishness">
<text>Selfishness is being concerned excessively or exclusively for oneself or one&#x27;s own advantage, pleasure, or welfare, regardless of others.

Selfishness is the opposite of altruism or selflessness, and has also been contrasted (as by C. S. Lewis) with self-centeredness.

==Divergent views==
The implications of selfishness have inspired divergent views within religious, philosophical, psychological, economic, and evolutionary contexts. Some early examples of &quot;selfist&quot; thinking are the egoistic philosophies of Yangism in ancient China and of Cyrenaic hedonism in ancient Greece. Yangists followed the teachings of Yang Zhu and might have been influenced by Taoism. Cyrenaics, founded by Aristippus of Cyrene, were skeptics and materialists (but perhaps nominally Greek pagans). Thomas Hobbes, who could also be viewed as &quot;selfist&quot;, was a materialist but also advocated loyalty to a strong government and state church. The views of Friedrich Nietzsche and Max Stirner provide a more proximate link to the modern selfists.

===Classical===
Aristotle joined a perceived majority of his countrymen in condemning those who sought only to profit themselves; but he approved the man of reason who sought to gain for himself the greatest share of that which deserved social praise.

Seneca proposed a cultivation of the self within a wider community—a care for the self which he opposed to mere selfishness in a theme that would later be taken up by Foucault.

===Medieval/Renaissance===
Selfishness was viewed in the Western Christian tradition as a central vice—as standing at the roots of the seven deadly sins in the form of pride.

Francis Bacon carried forward this tradition when he characterized “Wisdom for a man&#x27;s self...[a]s the wisdom of rats”.

===Modern===
With the emergence of a commercial society, Bernard Mandeville proposed the paradox that social and economic advance depended on private vices—on what he called the sordidness of selfishness.

Adam Smith with the concept of the invisible hand saw the economic system as usefully channelling selfish self-interest to wider ends. John Locke, along with Adam Smith, was a key figure in early classical liberalism: an ideology that champions notions of individualism and negative liberty. These core themes inevitably relate to the concept of selfishness. Locke, for example, sought for people to exercise &quot;self-government&quot;—the idea that an individual should make his/her own decisions. This inherent right would allow individuals to pursue self-interests, rather than suffer the burdens of any altruistic obligations. Thus, unlike political ideologies such as socialism, Locke and other classical liberals believe that selfishness is engrained in human nature. Locke arguably opened the door for later thinkers like Ayn Rand to argue for selfishness as a social virtue and the root of social progress. Ayn Rand held that selfishness is a virtue.

Roman Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain opposed the latter view by way of the Aristotelian argument that framing the fundamental question of politics as a choice between altruism and selfishness is a basic and harmful mistake of modern states. Rather, cooperation ought to be the norm: human beings are by nature social animals, and so individual persons can only find their full good in and through pursuing the good of the community.

=== Ecology ===
In ecology, species sometimes would cooperate each other, which could be considered as a mutualistic behavior. But species choose to have mutualistic behaviors, because the mutualistic behaviors could provide them more benefits to fit in the environment, which ultimately is a selfishness behavior. For example, animal cooperation exists in wild dogs community. They hunt together for large mammals easier. During the hunting, each individuals would have specific roles, like chase the prey toward a cliff and make other individuals easy to hunt.

In Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of biological evolution, species understand the intensity of competition in nature, which requires a degree of selfishness in order to gain limited resources and survive to reproduce. 

==Selfism==
The term &quot;selfism&quot; was used by Paul Vitz in his 1977 book &quot;Psychology as Religion: The Cult of Self-Worship&quot; to refer to any philosophy, theory, doctrine, or tendency that upholds explicitly selfish principles as being desirable. The term is usually used pejoratively.. Vitz deconstructs the selfist movement(s) and tries to uphold God-centered altruism, and claims that all of modern-day liberalism and leftism are essentially selfist at their core. He lays the blame predominantly at the feet of Erik Erikson, Erich Fromm, and other prominent psychologists of the third quarter of the 20th century (c. 1950–1975 CE).

Explicit selfishness as a desirable end and moral good had diverse manifestations during that period, for example, in the writings of David Seabury, Ayn Rand, and even among some of Rand&#x27;s near-opposites, such as Erikson and Fromm. Rand called her philosophy Objectivism. Later popularizers of similar positions include Nathaniel Branden, Paul Lepanto, Robert Ringer, Harry Browne, and David Kelley, among others. None of these named the system they espoused &quot;selfism&quot; or characterized it as &quot;selfist&quot;, although both Seabury and Rand included the word &quot;selfishness&quot; in the titles of books presenting their views. Many of these figures were pro-capitalist secularists (&quot;atheist capitalists&quot;), but Seabury was a Christian, while Erickson and Fromm were prominent leftists.

Anton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan and author of &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, acknowledges Ayn Rand and Objectivism as a source of inspiration for LaVeyan Satanism. This form of Satanism holds the self above all else in similar fashion to Objectivism. Despite some similarities, they remain separate entities, as there are clear differences between the two concepts.

==Psychology==
Lack of empathy has been seen as one of the roots of selfishness, extending as far as the cold manipulation of the psychopath.

The contrast between self-affirmation and selfishness has become a conflictual arena in which the respective claims of individual/community are often played out between parents and children or men and women, for example.

Psychoanalysts favor the development of a genuine sense of self, and may even speak of a healthy selfishness, as opposed to the self-occlusion of what Anna Freud called &quot;emotional surrender&quot;.

==Criminology==
Self-centeredness was marked as a key feature in a phenomenological theory of criminality named &quot;The Criminal Spin&quot; model. Accordingly, in most criminal behaviors there is a heightened state of self-centeredness, that differently manifests itself in different situations and in different forms of criminality.

==History==
All of what is now Minato Ward was part of the holdings of Owari Domain during the Edo period. After the Meiji Restoration, the area was transferred to the new Nagoya Prefecture, which later became part of Aichi Prefecture. Nagoya was divided into wards on April 1, 1908. In 1922, Ousu village in Aichi District was annexed by the city of Nagoya becoming part of Minami Ward. The Nagoya Port Drawbridge was completed in 1926. On October 1, 1937 the city of Nagoya was re-divided into ten wards, with the original Minami Ward divided into the new Minami Ward, plus Atsuta Ward, Nakagawa Ward, Minato Ward, and part of Showa Ward. In 1955, the town of Nanyo from Ama District was annexed by Minato Ward. In 1959, the Isewan Typhoon caused severe damage to the area.

==Economy==
The economy of Minato Ward is dominated by Nagoya Port, one of the busiest in Japan.

<text>Priest Joseph Brooks, (known professionally as Soopafly born December 8, 1972) is a hip hop producer and rapper from Long Beach, California. He is a member of the DPGC.

==Early life==
The oldest of three children, Brooks grew up in Long Beach. He was given a keyboard by his father after being inspired by the piano players he saw in church.

===Early career===
During his teenage years, Brooks met rappers Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre. Proving himself with his keyboard skills, Soopafly was assigned his first piece of work for Death Row Records on the soundtrack &quot;Murder Was The Case&quot;. He played keyboards for Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on the track &quot;Natural Born Killaz&quot; and for Jodeci on the track &quot;Come Up To My Room&quot;, as well as his first production credit with &quot;Who Got Some Gangsta Shit&quot; featuring Snoop Dogg and Tha Dogg Pound. In 1995, he produced &quot;Sooo Much Style&quot; for Tha Dogg Pound on their debut album &quot;Dogg Food&quot;. He also played the keyboards on eight other songs throughout. Then in 1996, he was featured on the soundtrack to the movie &quot;A Thin Line Between Love and Hate&quot; on the song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Hang.&quot; A remix would later follow.

Soopafly was further introduced to mainstream listeners on Snoop Dogg&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Tha Doggfather&quot;. He produced the songs &quot;Freestyle Conversation&quot; and &quot;You Thought&quot;, appearing alongside veteran rapper Too Short. Since then, he has been featured primarily on albums by local artists such as Snoop Dogg, Daz Dillinger, Kurupt, Warren G, RBX, Bad Azz and Tha Eastsidaz. To date, he has released three solo albums.

===Westurn Union===
In July 2006, the rap group called Westurn Union was formed. It features Soopafly, Damani and Bad Lucc. They made their first appearance on Snoop Dogg&#x27;s album &quot;Tha Blue Carpet Treatment&quot; and released a street single titled &quot;I Don&#x27;t Think So&quot;, produced by Rick Rock. In April 2008, a mixtape was released titled &quot;House Shoe Musik, Vol. 1&quot; and was hosted by DJ Crazy Toones. After inking a deal with Koch Records and Doggystyle Records, the official debut album Snoop Dogg Presents: Dubb Union was released on September 2, 2008. Prior to the release, the group and the labels were approached by the company Western Union, threatening legal action if the name was not changed. Though there is a difference between Westurn and Western, the labels did not want to spend money dealing with a lawsuit, the name of the group was changed to Dubb Union.

<text>Tlaquiltenango is a city in the Mexican state of Morelos. It is south of Mexico city and southeast of Cuernavaca, the state capital via Mexican Federal Highway 95D.
The city serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality, with which it shares a name. The toponym &quot;Tlaquiltenango &quot;comes from a Nahuatl name and means &quot;place of whitewashed walls&quot;. 
The municipality reported 33,844 inhabitants in the year 2015 census.

==History==
===Prehispanic history===
There are two pre-Hispanic archaeological sites in Tlaquiltenango: &quot;Chimalacatlan&quot; and &quot;Huaxtla&quot;. Chamalacatlan was built on the top of the hill of &quot;El Venado&quot;; it had 33 terraces and an equal number of piles of cut stone. There is also a small cave that was used for ceremonies. From the top of the hill, you can see Lake Tequesquitengo, Xochicalco, and parts of the state of Guerrero. The site is almost unique among Mesoamerican ruins in that the walls and platform were constructed of megaliths rather than the smaller rocks usually found in such structures. A small ceremonial ballcourt is also uncharacteristic of the Olmecs. The ruins were described by Fernando de Alva Ixtlixochitl in the early 17th century, although the modern discovery by Father Lorenzo Castro in the late 19th century was more significant. Castro reported his find to Bishop Francisco Plancarte y Navarrete, who speculated Chimalacatlan was none other than the mythological Tamoanchan, the cradle of Mesoamerican civilization.
Huaxtla was built in what is the center of the community by that name today, at the top of a horseshoe-shaped hill. The ruins are similar to those of Chimalacatlan. It is believed that the inhabitants of these sites were from Tepexpan, who migrated south in search of better food and a better climate.

===Conquest and colonialism===
Tlaquiltenango was included in the towns belonging to the marquisate of the Valley of Oaxtepec, awarded to the conquistador Hernán Cortés. Cortes established a hacienda for the breeding of fine horses that would be destined for his army; for its surveillance, he ordered the construction of a circular stone tower with a height of close to .

The convent-fortress &quot;Santo Domingo de Guzmán&quot; was initiated by the order of the Franciscans and finished by the Dominicans in the year 1540, one the oldest of the American continent. The convent is not very well-maintained, and there are cracks in the walls, and interior frescos are in poor condition. The clock was installed in December, 1898. In 1909, Mauricio de la Arena and Father Agapito Mateo Menes discovered a prehispanic codex in one corner; this is at the National Museum of Anthropology today.

===Independence period===
Tlaquiltenango became a city of the State of Mexico in 1825 under the 1824 Constitution of Mexico. It included not only present-day Tlaquiltenango, but also the municipalities of Jojutla and Zacatepec, and stretched southeast to the Cuautla River. It became a municipality of Morelos by decree of governor Carlos Pacheco on September 25, 1884.

The 2017 earthquake did considerable damage in Tlaquitenango. Two children and two women were killed, while a woman from &quot;Valle de Vázquez&quot; was killed in Jojutla. The earthquake left a large crack in the earth that split two houses apart and destroyed 183 others and severely damaged 365 other homes in Colonia Celino Manzanares next to the Yautepec River. The 16th-century church was severely damaged, as was the 17th-century bridge in Colonia Manzares, 60 stone fences collapsed, and the municipal hall was damaged. The Secreatary of Health reported that 396 homes were destroyed and 510 were damaged.

Jorge Maldonado Ortiz of &quot;Juntos Haremos Historia&quot; (Morena Together we will make history coalition) was elected Presidente Municipal (mayor) on July 1, 2018. José Almanza Alcaine, a former alderman and the 2018 candidate of Movimiento Ciudadano for municipal president, was gunned down on January 27, 2019. His two companions were also shot, and one died.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, Tlaquiltenango blocked the entrances to the community. The town reports two confirmed cases and one death as of April 27, 2020. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. On July 2, Tlaquiltenango reported eleven infections and one death from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13.

The church is very large and rectangular. The main entrance is on the west side, and there is a side entrance on the south that is very similar to that of the Cuernavaca Cathedral. The nave and presbytery are separated by a triumphal arch supported by large, circular The columns. The western entrance to the church is simple and austere; above the access arch there is a stone triangle with a small window. There is a clock that was added in 1898 above the window.

The base of the bell tower is connected to the main façade of the church. It is proportionately tall and consists of two ornamented sections for bells that contrast with the general austerity of the church itself.

There are large pink, stone buttresses on the south side of the church and a carved, Franciscan-style cross above the main entrance. The interior of the church is simple in the Dominican style. The monastery cloister is high with a small central patio; the cells for the monks are simple.

<doc id="732212" wikidata="Q2604992" url="?curid=732212" title="Tlayacapan">
<text>Tlayacapan () is the name of a town and a municipality located in the northeast part of Morelos state in central Mexico. It is located 60 km east from the state capital of Cuernavaca and about 1.5 hours south of Mexico City. It is a rural area, whose way of life has not changed much over the 20th century, with 90% of its population still partially or fully dependent on agriculture. The town has old mansions, houses with red tile roofs and streets paved with stones. Many ravines crisscross the area and are crossed by numerous stone bridges.

The main landmark is the former monastery of San Juan Bautista, which towers over all the other structures. It was built beginning the 1530s, along with 26 chapels scattered around the original town as part of the “spiritual conquest” of the area. Today, this monastery is part of the Monasteries on the slopes of Popocatépetl, which was made a World Heritage Site in 1994. Culturally, the town is famous for two things: being the origin of the Chinelos dance and the home of the Banda Tlayacapan band, the most important culturally in the state and nationally recognized.

Tlayacapan was also a popular filming location for many Mexican and American films such as &quot;La Valentina&quot;, starring María Félix and Eulalio González, and &quot;Two Mules for Sister Sara&quot;, starring Shirley MacLaine and Clint Eastwood. American rock band The Killers, filmed the music video of their hit song When You Were Young, in 2006.

==Landmarks==

===The monastery===
Towering over everything else in the town, is the former monastery of San Juan Baustista (John the Baptist). This monastery is part of the series of monasteries near the Popocatepetl volcano which was declared a World Heritage Site in 1994. Today only the church portion retains its original function and serves as the parish church for the municipality. The patron saint of the town is John the Baptist, whose feast day is celebrated on 24 June.

The monastery complex was constructed by the Augustinians between 1534 and 1574, along with a number of chapels scattered throughout the town. It is fronted by an atrium which is larger than in any other monastery complex in the state. The facade of the church has small images of suns and moons. Its complex is a mixture of a number of architectural styles including Roman, Medieval, Plateresque, Gothic and Moorish. The church is one of the largest in Morelos. Despite its importance, the building lacks altarpieces and decorative elements in its architecture. The number 12 is found in all of its corners, 12 foundations, 12 doors, 12 main rooms, and others. The total comes to 144, the number of walls of the “perfect city” described in the Apocalypse. The main nave of the church measures 14 meters wide, 28 meters tall and 56 meters long, and match those of the Santi Quattro Coronati basilica in Rome. One of the main attractions of the monastery museum are the frescos in the entrance hall and meditation hall. The paintings in the entrance hall were done for evangelization purposes. The monastery&#x27;s church remains with its original function. The rest, such as courtyards, cloister, chapels, dining hall, prayer rooms, kitchen, gardens, and monks’ cells have disappeared or have been converted to other uses.

The cloister area and part of the open chapel have been converted into a site museum. This museum contains pre-Hispanic artifacts, Catholic religious objects, religious paintings from the 17th century and more. One item which stands out is a painting of “Nuestra Señora de la Luz” an oil work of the Virgin Mary pregnant. It is claimed that from whatever angle the work is viewed, the Virgin appears to be looking directly at the onlooker. Two other important pieces are an anonymous paintings from the 16th century with Flemish influence presenting Saint Augustine and pictorial fragments from an altarpiece from 1737. The museum also contains a number of mummified remains on display. These were found under the floor of the main nave of the monastery church in 1982, when restoration work was being performed. These remains are of several children and one adolescent, each found in its own wooden coffin and in good condition. They were identified as upper-class Spanish due to their dress. The belief at that time was to be buried in the church as close to the altar as possible in order to reach heaven sooner. Today they can be viewed in the museum in the room which used to be the dispensary. For this reason and others, photos inside the museum area are strictly prohibited.

The museum area underwent more restoration work in 1997 which was funded by the INAH, the &quot;Instituto de Cultura de Morelos&quot;, and the American Express Foundation. Much of this work involved the cleaning and restoration of the murals in the cloister area. Some of the best preserved works are in the &quot;Sala Profundis&quot; or meditation room where there are depictions of the Four Evangelists, Saints Peter and Paul, the Virgin Mary and the Crucifixion.

===The chapels===

Associated with the monastery is a series of 26 chapels, which were located in places were pre-Hispanic rituals had been performed as part of the “spiritual conquest” of the area. Some of these chapels have been abandoned and are in ruins. Eighteen remain in use and are being gradually restored. These chapels are divided into three groups, &quot;Capillas de Cabecera&quot; (main chapels), &quot;Capillas de Calpulli&quot; (family chapels), and &quot;Capillas de Relación&quot;. While some are simple, even humble structures, several of the chapels are surprisingly elaborated with decorative facades, towers, espadañas and decorative gateways, some dating from colonial times. Each of the chapels has its own feast day and each neighborhood has its own chapel.

It has 21 chapels associated with it, classified into three groups: capillas de cabecera capillas de calpulli and capillas de relacíon. The most important of these are the capillas de cabecera or roughly “head chapels” which include El Rosario, Santa Ana, Señor de la Exaltación and Señor Santiago. These four chapels mark the four pre-Hispanic neighborhood temples or teocallis in each of the cardinal directions, in the same relative location vis-à-vis the main teocalli, where the monastery is now. Santa Ana is found in the north, La Exaltación in the south, Santiago in the east and El Rosario in the west.

The chapel of the &quot;Señora del Rosario&quot; (Our Lady of the Rosary) is one that marks the town&#x27;s traditional western boundary and lends its name to the surrounding neighborhood. It has an east–west orientation and is paired with the chapel of &quot;Santiago&quot; (St. James) on the east side of town. It is adorned with stucco filigree, with seven niches in the body and three in the bell areas. It used to be said that when the bells of this chapel sounded, hunger would go away. Festival of the Señora del Rosaio is 7 October, with toritos de luces (small bull shaped frames with fireworks), festival and wind bands.

The chapel of &quot;Santa Ana&quot; (St. Anne) is located in the north of the town. Its facade is very sober and contains a medallion of the saint, which was placed there in 1973. Inside, the saint is represented along the Virgin Mary and the infant Jesus. This is the only chapel which does not have a canon vault but rather a gothic style one. Each year, pilgrims to Chalma leave from and return to this chapel. The neighborhood around it, called Barrio Norte or Barrio Santa Ana was the traditional exit to Mexico City. The chapel of Santa Ana is the scene of the commemoration of the Virgen de los Dolores (Virgin of the Sorrows) on the sixth Friday of Lent and the Procession of the Holy Burial (Santo Entierro) during Holy Week.

The Santiago Chapel is found in the Santiago neighborhood, which used to be called Texcalpa, or the “witch” (male) neighborhood. Here are found many of the town&#x27;s potters making everyday items such as pots for mole. The interior of this chapel is more decorated than most others with multicolored winged angels and saints. There is a three-gate opening into the atrium. The original atrium cross was decorated with flowers but this was stolen some time ago, as well as a number of other objects from the chapel property. The original doors remain, decorated with a mixture of symbols representing stars, suns and people. The squares with depictions of the sun and moon are considered to be particularly important. Each bell tower is decorated with Talavera tiles as well as stone spheres, which contain certification as to their perfection. Feast day is 25 July and celebrated with pre-Hispanic dance.

The &quot;Capilla de la Exaltación&quot;, also called Capillas de La Cruz, is located in the south. It contains an image of a Black Christ said to work miracles and is the object of local pilgrimage. The day of the Señor de la Exaltación is the first Friday of Lent, with events from Thursday evening to the following Sunday, such as pre-Hispanic dances and fireworks.

The capillas de relación, or chapels related to a specific ancient deity converted into a saint, consist of Nuestra Señora del Tránsito, San Lucas, San Pedro and San Jerónimo. The day of Nuestra Señora del Trànsito is the fourth Friday of Lent, with activities beginning on Wednesday and extending to Sunday. This consists of dances called &quot;jaripeos&quot;, fireworks and processions as the Virgin makes her way to Tepoztlán. One of the town&#x27;s many legends involves the Virgen del Transito figure of the Virgin Mary, which was originally from Tepoztlan. This figure was burned and one was sought who could repair it in Tlayacapan. It is said that this figure “fell in love” with the figure of Saint Martin and wished to stay, so it became too heavy to lift. Today, the image has its own chapel in the far southwest of the community, but the figure itself remains in the chapel of San Martin.

The capillas de calpulli cover other types of sites in the four pre-Hispanic neighborhoods. They include San Jerónimo, Santa Marta, Santa Cruz de Altica, San Diego, La Magdalena, San Lorenzo, La Tlazcalchica, San Nicolás, La Concepcón, San Miguel, La Asunción, San Martín, La Natividad and Los Reyes. Those chapels on the outskirts, such as San Nicolás, San Pedro, San Lucas, Las Animas and El Transito, mark traditional exits from the pre-Hispanic village. The smallest chapels, also called &quot;ermitas&quot; (hermitages) mark topographic sites or other devotional areas. The festival of the Chapel of Santa Cruz of Altica is on 3 May, as well as the chapel of Tlazcalchica. The Capilla de la Natividad contains the Museo del Alfarero or Potters’ Museum.

===La Cerería===

The &quot;Cerería&quot; Museum and Cultural Center (Wax or candle factory) is housed in a building which covers an entire city block and dates back to the 16th century. Its original function was the Encomendero Español or the headquarters for the local encomendero system. In the 17th century, it became one of the first waxworks in the Americas. This waxworks was noted in the region for making beautiful candles, and became a place to stock up on these for those traveling to and from Mexico City. The building was enlarged over time showing a number of different architectural styles. It contains a large &quot;alijbe&quot; or water storage tank in the main courtyard. There are also gargoyles. During the Mexican Revolution, the building served as a barracks for Emiliano Zapata’s troops.

The building was repaired and converted into its present function in the late 20th century. The restoration of the La Cerería was a common cause for the community, who were aided by researchers, scholars and other volunteers from outside. The rooms have been conditioned to display aspects of the municipality’s history and traditions, such as its pre-Hispanic past, its musicians, its pottery tradition, its numerous 16th-century chapels and the Chinelos. There are also two rooms dedicated to temporary exhibits. Workshops offered vary from crafts to personal development to languages such as English and Nahuatl to painting to chess as well as local traditions. The building has been used to film a number of movies because of its architecture.

===Former Hacienda of San Nicolás===
The former Hacienda of San Nicolás is located in the Pantitlán neighborhood, but it is in ruins. It is said that it originally belonged to Hernán Cortés who bequeathed it to a grandson named Pedro in the 16th century. The original owners supported the work of the local Augustinians and when then property first became abandoned, these brothers took it over. In 1809, the government confiscated it and it has remained government property since.

==History==

The origin of the name is from Nahuatl and means “over the point or nose of the earth” but it can also be translated at “the limits of the earth.”

===Prehispanic Period===

The first culture in the area was the Olmec, who are known only by archeological remains. Some of the archeological work done here was by Francisco Plancarte y Navarete, who was also the second bishop of Cuernavaca in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He found a large number of Olmec clay figures here and other areas nearby.

Later in the pre-Hispanic period, the area became dominated by the Xochimilcas, who remained dominant until the arrival of the Spanish. The town of Tlayacapan dates back at least to 1400 C.E. when chronicles describe it as an important commercial center. The area was an important trade route between Tenochtitlan and points south. It has an important ceremonial center with altars dedicated to Tonantzin and other deities. This center was in the center of the town, where the monastery is now. The tecpan, or governor&#x27;s palace was located where the municipal palace is now. The old market area retains its original function to this day. The pre-Hispanic town was ordered into four neighborhood aligned with the cardinal directions, called calpullis. These are marked by the four largest chapels in the town.

===Conquest &amp; Colonial Period===

In 1520, while Hernán Cortés was still trying to conquer Tenochtitlan, the Spanish sent an expedition south of the valley into this area. In 1521, the Spanish fought the natives of Tlayacapan on the hill called &quot;Ziualopapalozink&quot; (Spanish: El Cerro del Sombrero). The Spanish left the area and headed for Oaxtepec, Yautepec and then to Cuernavaca and back to the Valley of Mexico. The lords of Tlayacapan sent many warriors to Tenochtitlan to help defend the Aztec Empire. Tlayacapan was not completely subdued by Cortés militarily until 1539. The “spiritual conquest” began with the building of the San Juan Bautista monastery and its associated chapels in the 1530s by the Augustinians. A total of 26 chapels would be built through the town over older significant pre-Hispanic sites. However, in the early colonial period, the indigenous would hide native deities such as Yacatecutli, the god of commerce, inside hollow figures of saints and march with them in procession.

===19th Century===

The indigenous lost most of their property rights and most of the land became haciendas, such as the Hacienda of &quot;San Carlos Borromeo&quot; and the &quot;Hacienda of San Nicolás&quot;. Most would not have property rights again until 1874. However, during the rule of Porfirio Díaz in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many indigenous claims would be thwarted in favor of the haciendas. Total restoration of rights came with the end of the Mexican Revolution.

===20th Century===

During the Mexican Revolution, the Liberation Army of the South was based here for a time. Emiliano Zapata left from here to Chinameca, where he was assassinated.

From the colonial period to recent times, the area has been relatively isolated, keeping many of its old traditions, including economy intact. The highway connecting Mexico City to Cuautla was built through here in the latter 20th century, bringing traffic and some tourism. In 1994, the San Juan Bautista monastery was named as part of a World Heritage site officially named “Earliest 16th century monasteries on the slopes of Popocatépetl”.

===21st Century===

A severe thunderstorm in August 2010, part of a system that brought widespread flooding to several states, overflowed ravines. These floods dumped debris and mud over most of the town&#x27;s streets and flooded the atrium and interior of the Capilla del Señor de Exhaltación, one of the town&#x27;s most important. Volunteers have since worked to clean and restore the building.

Five people were killed and 17 of 34 temples, including the Convent of St. John the Baptist, were damaged in the September 19, 2017 Puebla earthquake. 80% of the municipal palace was damaged.

&quot;Erasmo Mendoza Pedroza&quot; of Juntos Haremos Historia (Together we will make history coalition) was elected Presidente Municipal (mayor) on July 1, 2018.

As of May 7, 2020, the state of Morelos reported 688 confirmed cases and 87 deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico; two cases were reported in Tlayacapan. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. The state office of DIF sent food and water to vulnerable groups of people in eight municipalities including Tlayacapan on May 26. On July 2, Tlayacapan reported three infections and one death from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. Tlayacapan reported 81 cases, 57 recuperations, and 19 deaths from the virus as of August 31. One hundred six cases were reported on December 27, 2020.

==Culture==

===Carnival and the Chinelos===

Carnival and the dance of the Chinelos are intertwined in the municipality. Each year since the colonial period, Tlayacapan has had a Carnival just before Lent. The dance originated here as part of Carnival. The name Chinelo comes from the Nahuatl word zineloquie, which means “disguised”. During colonial times Spanish overlords were often cruel and oppressive to the mestizo and indigenous populations. During Carnival, masks were permitted and the dancers gradually took on an appearance designed to make fun of the Spanish. The gown mimics the nightgowns of Spanish colonial women, with white cotton gloves also serving to imitate these women. The ornate hat encrusted with fake jewels and large feathers mimics those worn by both sexes. The mask not only served to hide identity, but also they are made with wire mesh, painted pink, with heavy eyebrows and long pointed beards to mimic the abundant facial hair of Europeans. According to tradition, the hat was created by someone named Candido Rojas, the wire mesh masks by someone with the last name of Tlacomulco and the gown decorated with stripes and colored yoke by someone only known as “Barrabas”. The dancers march through the streets, striking poses and making jumping movements, often inviting onlookers to join in. They are accompanied by local bands, playing traditional music and even sons and other musical compositions created just for them. This Chinelo tradition was copied and modified by many other towns in Morelos, starting with Tepoztlán, which has its own colors and style of hat. There are also Chinelo dancers in the southern boroughs of Milpa Alta and Xochimilco in nearby Mexico City. However, the dance is now a symbol of the state of Morelos.

Featuring the Chinelos dancing and marching through the streets, the Carnival tradition here is centuries old and held the days just before Ash Wednesday. By the time of the Mexican Revolution, the tradition had waned but it has made a comeback since the 1920s. Like with other versions of Carnival, the event is held for several days before Ash Wednesday but reaches its peak the night before on Tuesday. The annual celebration took root here during the colonial period in the mestizo and indigenous neighborhoods of the town, especially those who maintained strong indigenous traditions. One of these was the “nemontemi” or the five days at the end of the Aztec calendar, which occurred in early February, around the same time as the beginning of Lent. This event also marks the beginning of the dry season, when there is no agricultural work. Work moves to the management of stored grain and crafts.

On the day before Ash Wednesday, festivities begin at 10 in the morning with music and dance as well as fireworks. These wind through the streets on their way to the main square. The party continues in the square with music and food and rides and other attractions. However, the real festivities begin at sundown and continue until the stroke of midnight of Wednesday. Throughout the day and night, Chinelos can be seen dancing through the crowds. At its height, there are about 15,000 people crowded into the town center.

===Banda Tlayacapan===
A number of bands featuring wind instruments play during Carnival and other festivals, but the oldest and best known of Tlayacapan&#x27;s wind ensembles is the &quot;Banda Tlayacapan&quot;. This organization was begun in 1870 by Vidal Santamaría, with only a chirimia (a traditional wind instrument) and some drums. It was originally called &quot;Los Alarcones.&quot; Soon after, other instruments such as tubas and saxophones were added. The band survived a number of historic events, such as the Mexican Revolution, as well as more mundane problems such as monetary disputes. Direction of the band has stayed with the Santamaría family, with Brigido Santamaria, who headed it for much of the 20th century, writing music for the band, such as &quot;Danza de los Chinelos&quot; and sons and preserving older traditional pieces that might have otherwise been lost. When he died in 1975, the band came under the direction of Carlos Santamaría who heads it today. The band received the 1998 Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes from President Ernesto Zedillo. 2010 marks the band&#x27;s 140th anniversary. Many of the modern band&#x27;s members represent generations of participation and the band is split into several sections for playing at different kinds of events such as traditional dances, civic events, and funerals. This band is culturally the most important in the state, and has traveled all over Mexico and the world.

===Pottery and juego de aire===

Pottery has been made in the town since far back into pre-Hispanic times. Some of the oldest pottery found here is associated with the Olmec culture. One distinctive technique to the areas pottery is using cattail fluff as temper, mixing it into the clay. Pottery items include flowerpots, storage jars, figures, cooking pots, comals, jars, dishes and more. Many are glazed in various colors. To honor the tradition there is a &quot;Museo del Alfarero&quot; or Potters’ Museum in the Capilla de la Natividad and a festival dedicated to the craft. The &quot;Feria del Barro&quot;, also known as the Festival Cultural de Tlayacapan was initiated by Cornelio Santamaría and is held each November. The 2009 Feria de Barro featured singer Susana Harp and groups such as Leones de la Sierra as well as the native Banda de Tlayacapan. The festival not only showcases the area&#x27;s pottery but also has expositions of photography, other crafts and children&#x27;s events.

One pottery tradition unique to the community is a set of figurines called a &quot;juego de aire&quot; (literally “air set”). This is a set of clay figures, which are used in ritual healing, especially of diseases associated with “bad air.” The last craftsperson to preserve the art of making these is Felipa Hernandez Barragan. The set demonstrates a ritual healing scene with one figure, representing the sick person, and another representing the “curandero” or shaman-healer with a bird in his hand at the center. Around them are various animals: a lizard, a millipede, a snake, a bull, a donkey, a spider, a scorpion and a frog, each of which has a cigarette tied to its back. These animals represent the various aspects of nature. Tradition states that certain illnesses are due to “bad air” or to supernatural forces that become offended if certain courtesies are not observed. One of these courtesies is to greet and/or offer food to an ant hill when walking by. Another is to make an offering in ravines and other places where water flows. Most of these beliefs have pre-Hispanic roots.

===Food===
Traditional dishes include pipian (both red and green), tamales, various types of beans and tlacoyos. One local bean is called “ayocote” which is large and dark red. Avocado leaves are used to flavor food and dishes often feature tomatoes, tomatillos, nopals and a plant called &quot;huanzontle&quot;. &quot;Cecina&quot; (salted beef or pork) from the nearby town of Yecapixtla is popular as well.

==Geography==

The municipality consists of the main town of Tlayacapan and 31 populated communities, which cover an area of 71.52 km2. The largest community is Tlayacapan, which accounts for about half of the municipal population. Other significant communities include, Cuauhtempan (San Andrés Cuauhtempan), Los Laureles (San José de los Laureles) and Nacatongo.(inegi) The municipality borders the municipalities of Tlanepantla, Yautepec, Totolapan, Atlatlahucan and Tepoztlán.
The municipality is a valley surrounded by a chain of low mountains, most of which belong to the Sierra de Tepozteco. Which have capricious forms. To the south are peaks known as Ventanilla and Sombrerito. To the west are Huixtlazink, Tlatoani and Ziualopapalozink, which is the highest. On the northwest side are Tezontlala, Cuitlazimpa and Tepozoco, and on the north side is Amixtepec. Most of these peaks are rounded, which give the area its Nahuatl name. One of the figures said to appear on one of the mountains is that of the mother goddess Tonantzin. Forty two other god images are said to appear in the mountain range. One legend states that the faces of these gods were sculpted by human hands when the king Quetzalcoatl came to this area and pronounced it sacred. The profile of Tonantzin has been identified with the Virgin of Guadalupe because it appears most readily in the morning of 12 December, this virgin&#x27;s feast day.
===Hydrography===
There are no permanent rivers but there are seasonal ravines that crisscross the valley floor. The largest of these include Tepanate, Chicotla, Huiconchi and Santiago.
===Climate===
The climate is temperate and semi humid. Most rain falls during the rainy season in summer and early fall. Average temperature is 16C. Prevailing winds run south to north. 
===Wildlife===
There are mostly small mammals with some deer and the occasional puma. There are a number of bird species such as storks and owls and a number of reptiles and amphibians. There are also many varieties of spiders.
Tlayacapan is included in the nature preserve called &quot;Chichinautzin&quot;, which was established in 1988.

==Economy==

The area&#x27;s economy is decidedly rural; however the overall municipality is not considered to be economically marginalized. One community is ranked as extremely poor and eleven ranked as poor, accounting for just under 2,200 of the municipality&#x27;s total population.

Agriculture and livestock form at least part of the economic base for over 90% of the population. Almost all farming occurs during the rainy season from June to October. Important crops include tomatoes, corn, beans, squash and cucumbers. However, the growing of tomatoes has decreased due to plant infestations, costs of herbicides and insecticides and falling market prices. Most of the municipal land was held communally in ejidos until recent constitutional changes allowed more land to pass into private hands.

While agriculture remains the backbone of the area&#x27;s economy, pottery is important culturally. This area&#x27;s pottery has been produced the same way since the colonial period, with many of the same designs. Most workshops are family owned and generational, although only 1% of the population makes a living this way, and most is made in the Texcalpan or Santiago neighborhood. In addition to its own pottery, a number of stores have become distributors of crafts from other parts of the state as well as from Michoacán, Querétaro, Guanajuato and Puebla.

Mining was done there in colonial times but there are no records indicating exactly where. Some stories indicate that gold was mined in the Tlatoani Hill and silver in Popotlán. Some openings in these mountains have been found but have not been explored. The area has deposits of lime, plaster, andesite, basalt and other volcanic rock, but these are not currently exploited.

Tourism is also considered important, due to attractions such as the former monastery and the La Cerería museum, but this only employs 0.25% of the population. There are 23 stores in the municipality. Tourism and commerce together employ 7.3% of the population. Tlayacapan is part of the Ruta del Volcan, which is a tourist route set up by the state tourism trust. This route also includes Tepoztlan and Yecapixtla, with the “volcán” referring to the Popocatépetl volcano. Due to its “historic attributes”, there have been calls for the town to become a “Pueblo Mágico” (a program sponsored by the federal government), and it is being considered for inclusion.

==Demographics==
As of 2005, only 488 people were counted as speaking an indigenous language, down from 784 in 2000, accounting for only 3,8% of the overall population. Few emigrate from here, but there is a fair amount of immigration from states such as Guerrero, Oaxaca and Puebla.

The population in 2015 was 17,714, up from 13,851 in 2000. Almost all residents profess the Catholic faith.

==Transportation==
The major highway through the town connects the municipality with Mexico City to the north and Cuautla, Morelos to the south. There is another highway that connects the area with Yautepec de Zaragoza. Several bus lines provide service to the area including Cristóbal Colon and Estrella Roja. Local public transportation provides service to local areas as well as Oaxtepec.

<doc id="732213" wikidata="Q2991063" url="?curid=732213" title="Totolapan">
<text>Totolapan is a municipality in the north of the Mexican state of Morelos, surrounded by the State of Mexico to the north; to the south with Tlayacapan and Atlatlahucan; to the east and southeast with Atlatlahucan; and to the west with Tlalnepantla.

The city serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality, with which it shares a name. The municipality reported 11,992 inhabitants in the 2015 census.

The toponym &quot;Totolapan &quot;comes from a Nahuatl name and means &quot;birds on water&quot;. The full name is Totolapan de Montes de Oca. Fernando Montes de Oca was a cadet who died at the Battle of Chapultepec during the Mexican–American War in 1847.

==History==
The Chichimecas were the first settlers, who called the land &quot;Totalapan.&quot; Between 1150 and 1350 the Xochimilcas entered the territory, and later by Moctezuma. Totolapan was part of the territory of Huaxtepec.

Hernan Cortés sent Gonzalo de Sandoval to Huaxtepec (Oaxtepec), also taking Totolapan in 1519, at the beginning of the Spanish Conquest.

After the conquest, the lands of &quot;encomienda&quot; were granted to Diego Olguín in 1536, but when the &quot;Marquisate of the Valley of Oaxaca&quot; was created, they were annexed to it.

The native population was evangelized by the Augustinians and the Monastery of &quot;San Guillermo Abad&quot; was built in 1545 under the leadership of Fray Jorge de Ávila. This is one of the Monasteries on the slopes of Popocatépetl that have been declared World Heritage Sites by the UNESCO.

In 1742 Totolapan and surrounding communities were integrated into Chalco, and on January 1, 1813, these became parts of Cuernavaca and Cuautla.

A comet seen in the area of Popocateptl volcano in 1910 was seen as an omen that convinced many inhabitants to join the forces of Emiliano Zapata in the Mexican Revolution. Bloody battles occurred at the monastery and on the &quot;Cerro de Santa Barbara&quot;.

Servio Omar Livera Chavarria of Panal (New Alliance) was elected Presidente Municipal (mayor) on July 1, 2018. One of his priorities is to reestablish law enforcement, as several communities have established self-defense leagues, and he wants to prevent lynchings, like the recent one in Tetela del Volcan.

The Indigenous community of Hueyapan became self-governing on January 1, 2018.

The state of Morelos reported 209 cases and 28 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico as of April 27, 2020; one case was reported in Totalapan. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. On July 2, Totalapán reported 50 infections and four deaths from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. Totolapan reported 22 cases, 10 recuperations, and four deaths from the virus as of August 31. Twenty-eight cases were reported on December 27, 2020.

==Localities==
The town of &quot;Totalapan&quot; is composed of the four traditional barrios: &quot;La Purísima, Barrio San Agustín, Barrio San Marcos&quot;, and &quot;Barrio San Sebastián&quot;. There are three preschools; four public elementary schools, grades 1–6, (one for adults); and one middle school, grades 7–9. Totolapan is northeast of Cuernavaca and south of Mexico City.

The communities of Totalapan are primarily agricultural. Corn, beans, and oats are the primary crops, along with peaches, pears, apples, &quot;tejocote&quot; (a yellow fruit), and &quot;capulín&quot; (a type of cherry). Ranching includes cattle, pigs, goats, sheep, and horses; beekeeping is also significant. Nearly half the population are involved in construction and manufacturing.

==Attractions==
There are several tourist attractions in Totalapan. The Ecological Park Los Venados (the deer) is in the community of Nepopualco. The hill of &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; is an excellent option for quiet walks during the day. This provides an excellent view of the town and was used as a lookout post during the Revolution. The hill of &quot;el Aljibe&quot;, which means &quot;place where water is stored&quot;, is interred in the mountain. When people decide to visit this second hill, they can see ravines and fields. This involves a 40-minute walk to a cave which includes a cave with a cistern. A ceremony is held here every May 3.

There are also several colonial-era chapels. &quot;San Miguel y Santiago&quot; is in the town of Nepopualco, &quot;San Agustín&quot; is in Tepetlixpita, &quot;San Sebastián&quot; in the town of La Cañada, &quot;San Pablo&quot; in San Miguel, and ruins of the chapel of &quot;La Asunción&quot; are in Ahuatlán.

The main attraction is the &quot;Ex-Convento de San Guillermo de Abad&quot;, which dates from 1534 by Fray Jorge de Ávila of the order of the Augustinians and is part of the Monasteries on the slopes of Popocatépetl World Heritage Site. The monastery has an atrium designed for large processions. There are three &quot;posa&quot; chapels, including one attached to the main church, built for unbaptized Indians. The convent itself was built on a single floor, made of stone. It has a barrel vault, its facade is formed by a molded semicircular arch limited by two circular pilasters. The church has a wide altar with the image of San Guillermo. It also has several simulated monograms and ashlars, or carved stones. This is the only 16th-century convent with this type of decoration. The site is also unique because it is one of few that still includes the original garden area intact. The paintings in the interior of the church as well as the red geometric figures are well-preserved. The building has a great vaulted peak. Outside, the stucco facade was engraved with monograms and a stone carved with Christ. The side chapels include the original altars. There are two oil paintings reflecting the life of Fray Antonio de Roa. On the south side of the church, there is a large door that leads to the cloister of the convent. There is a painting that represents &quot;San Cristóbal&quot;. In the same area you can see paintings such as St. Augustine, works with plants, and other geometric motifs.

<doc id="732216" wikidata="Q1044039" url="?curid=732216" title="Geese Howard">
<text>is a fictional boss character and the main villain in SNK&#x27;s &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; fighting game series. Debuting in &quot;Fatal Fury: King of Fighters&quot;, Geese is the local crime boss of the fictional city of South Town. Geese created and hosts a fighting tournament named &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;, in which he faces the brothers Terry and Andy Bogard who want to take revenge for their father&#x27;s death. After several tournaments in the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series, Geese is killed by Terry in &quot;Real Bout Fatal Fury&quot;. However, he appears in following games without storyline as a &quot;ghost&quot; named . Geese has also appeared in other SNK&#x27;s games such as &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; games, in which he seeks to get the power from the creature Orochi and often sends teams representing him. His young self makes an appearance in the second &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; game as the final boss character. He also appears as downloadable content in Bandai Namco&#x27;s fighting game &quot;Tekken 7&quot;.

Outside video games, Geese has appeared in the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; animated adaptations as well as the CGI series &quot;The King of Fighters: Destiny&quot;. The character has been popular within both the SNK staff who decided to feature him as a spectre (Nightmare Geese) in games following his death as well as &quot;Tekken&quot; producer Katsuhiro Harada who believed the character would fit in &quot;Tekken 7&quot;. Video game journalists have given Geese popular response due to how overpowered Geese acts in his boss appearances across most of his story. Geese&#x27;s reveal as guest character in &quot;Tekken 7&quot; was met with acclaim due to how well he fit within the series&#x27; cast.

==Creation and development==

Although Geese was not modeled after any famous person or fictional character, SNK based him on Italian mafia. Geese became famous for his special moves which allows him to interrupt the player&#x27;s attacks and counterattack in a grab. Sub-boss Billy Kane obtained similar fame with both Geese and him having &quot;The Godfather&quot;-like influences that were expanded on later games. SNK was surprised by Geese&#x27;s popularity in the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series, topping Terry Bogard in terms of fan response in regard to what players wanted as playable character. &quot;Real Bout Fatal Fury&quot; was originally created with the goal of putting an end to the series&#x27; story with Geese Howard&#x27;s death in the ending, but Geese&#x27;s high popularity resulted in &quot;Real Bout Special&quot; having him again.

According to Akihiko Ureshino, Geese&#x27;s life as a fighter originally began with him being thoroughly beaten by Wolfgang, who was younger than him. If he would have committed suicide after being shocked by his humiliating defeat in the fight against Terry, he would have already chosen death when he was defeated by Wolfgang. Geese is said to have a genius sense for fighting arts, but he is not just a genius. Geese had obtained everything and reached the top, but regardless of the outcome, he put up the best fight with Terry. Calling as an arrogant ruler Geese never have considered the possibility of losing to Terry. However, the moment he actually lost to Terry, he felt strangely satisfied. This must have given him a deep feeling that he had seen everything there was to see. That&#x27;s why he shook off Terry&#x27;s hand and fell off the building with a loud laugh. Ureshino believes Terry had no intention of killing Geese and getting revenge, and at most he just wanted to defeat Geese and make Jeff apologize after he died. Ureshino thinks Terry&#x27;s feelings were expressed when he instinctively reached out his hand to Geese as he was falling off the building. However, Geese refused even that, and selfishly ended his life, abandoning the future of Billy and the connections he had built up. Ureshino said there are many people who don&#x27;t want to see Geese as an emaciated old man with gray hair, but perhaps the person who least wants to see him is Geese himself.

&quot;Dominated Mind&quot;, the PlayStation version of &quot;Real Bout Special&quot;, features Geese sporting a halo over his head as a reference to his passing, while the arcade version of &quot;Real Bout Special&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters 2002: Unlimited Match&quot; features Geese sporting an aura of chi surrounding his feet, which would later be canonized in &quot;Maximum Impact 2&quot; as &quot;Nightmare Geese&quot;. If he was a completely bonus character who didn&#x27;t interact with other characters, it might have been possible to have Geese appear as a living Geese instead of a Nightmare, but the &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; series has a grown-up Rock, and Billy is also participating this time, so the writer Akihiko Ureshino thinks they deliberately chose to have him appear in this form. For him, it was fun to think about the reactions of Rock, or Billy, who faced Geese&#x27;s nightmare. Of course, players should also pay attention to how Terry and the other &quot;Garou&quot; characters, or Southtown characters like Alsowa and Ryo, react when they come face to face with the revived nightmare. In response to rumors that Geese was a hidden character in &quot;Garou&quot;, the Neo Geo staff denied it.

Geese was first added to franchise &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;96&quot;. His inclusion highly awaited by developers and fans, as he was originally meant to appear in the previous game. Geese was partnered with two other SNK bosses, Mr. Big and Krauser. Even throughout the game, this boss team received special treatment. Leitmotif music were prepared for each member and at the time of this title&#x27;s release, enthusiasm for this game reached a feverish pitch. Numerous special moves were prepared for Geese, but in view of the memory capacity and time required for adjustments, a number of moves had to be left out. The character was meant to return in &quot;The King of Fighters XII&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters XIII&quot; but the developers did not have the time to add him. Due to the importance of Geese&#x27;s character to SNK, the company decided to include quickly in &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot;. This gave the team pressure in regards to adding his son Rock Howard as the character came from a game where Geese had been dead for a decade.

===Design===
In the making of &quot;Fatal Fury: The King of Fighters&quot;, SNK had multiple doubts how his design should be until it was decided he would wear a gi based on martial arts, as well as his overall name, likeness, and appearance being references to the three boss characters &quot;Black Gallop&quot;, &quot;Geese&quot;, and &quot;King&quot; from SNK&#x27;s previous Neo Geo game &quot;The Super Spy&quot; (1990). Despite being American, SNK wanted him to be a man inspired by Japanese culture resulting in his final look. The appearance of Geese in &quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot; was of a younger man with long blond hair wearing a light purple and blue suit with red necktie. The character&#x27;s popularity in &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and his younger look from the first original video animation influenced his appearance in &quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot; as a hidden boss.

In the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;, Geese appears as a middle-aged German American man with blond short, slicked hair, wearing a gi with red hakama and white uwagi without sandals. In most games of the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series - except &quot;Fatal Fury: King of Fighters&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;96&quot; - Geese only wears the red hakama pants with the white uwagi either not present or hanging off the back/sides. The development team behind &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; found his design as one of the most challenging ones to make alongside Terry Bogard&#x27;s. In the end, he kept his original look but topless. For his &quot;Nightmare Geese&quot;, an alternate look was given to the character, making Geese look like a zombie with silver hair, rotten skin and purple flames. 
Katsuhiro Harada said that if he could add a guest character into &quot;Tekken 7&quot; it would be Geese, praising the characters as he would fit into the cast. He added that both he and an interviewer liked the character which led to the idea of casting him into &quot;Tekken 7&quot;. While remaining true to Geese&#x27;s character, Harada stated his movements and design were completely remade so that fans from other series will try to play &quot;Tekken 7&quot; and learn its different mechanics. &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; producer Yasuyuki Oda was pleased with Geese&#x27;s inclusion in &quot;Tekken 7&quot; and celebrated it by taking a picture with Harada. For &quot;The King of Fighters XV&quot;, Tomohiro Nakata designed Geese with his business suit but with an emphasis on the black color, believing it fits his evil personality and reinforces his connection with the Howard Connection. Nakata also claimed that Geese&#x27;s classic gi was still available to select, finding his &quot;hakama&quot; iconic.

==Appearances==
===In video games===
Geese first appears as the final boss of &quot;Fatal Fury: King of Fighters&quot;. Backstory material reveals that he and fellow martial artist Jeff Bogard trained together under Tung Fu Rue, but he became jealous when Tung chose Jeff as his successor, leading him to murder Jeff in front of his adopted sons Terry and Andy. The central plot of the game centers around the Bogard brothers returning ten years later to avenge their father by defeating Geese in his &quot;King of Fighters&quot; tournament. After the player defeats Geese, he falls from the top of the building, being declared dead during the game&#x27;s ending. While Geese does not appear in &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot;, the plot revolves around his half brother Wolfgang Krauser seeking out the Bogard brothers to test himself against Geese&#x27;s killers. Geese returns in the revised version of the game, &quot;Fatal Fury Special&quot;, where it is revealed that he survived his fall at the end of the first game. &quot;Fatal Fury 3: Road to the Final Victory&quot; centers around Geese&#x27;s attempt to return to power by collecting the &quot;Sacred Scrolls of Jin&quot;, which is said to give their holder great power.

In the next game, &quot;Real Bout Fatal Fury&quot;, Geese is once again the final boss in the single-player tournament, confronting the player atop Geese Tower. In either, Terry&#x27;s or Andy&#x27;s ending, Geese falls off his tower once again, refusing to accept help from either of the Bogard brothers, leaving Terry to later raise Geese&#x27;s young son, Rock Howard. Although this game was developed with the intention of featuring the character&#x27;s death, Geese&#x27;s popularity resulted in him still appearing in the next titles. Geese appears in the subsequent game which does not feature a plot, &quot;Real Bout Fatal Fury Special&quot;, as a hidden final boss named Nightmare Geese. He also appears as a regular character in &quot;Real Bout Fatal Fury 2&quot;, which also has no storyline, as well as &quot;Wild Ambition&quot;, a remake of the first &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; game.

Geese also makes an appearance in the second game in the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; series. &quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot;, which is set a decade before the first &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;, features a younger Geese Howard as the corrupt police commissioner of Southtown. Geese is revealed to be Mr. Big&#x27;s boss and the mastermind behind the events of the previous game such as the kidnapping of Yuri Sakazaki. If the player wins every match against all the previous computer-controlled opponents without losing a round, the player&#x27;s character will face Geese Howard as a hidden final boss. In the non-canon crossover video games &quot;NeoGeo Battle Coliseum&quot; and the &quot;SNK vs. Capcom&quot; series, Geese appears as a playable character; in the latter he commonly appears as a boss character.

Geese also appears in a few games in &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series, which does not follow the continuity established by the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; games, despite sharing many characters and plot elements. In &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;96&quot;, Geese serves as the leader of the &quot;Boss Team&quot; along with former subordinate Mr. Big and rival Wolfgang Krauser, seeking to find the Orochi power. Geese would appear again in a non-playable role as the sponsor of the &quot;Special Team&quot; in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;97&quot;, which is composed of Billy Kane, Blue Mary, and Ryuji Yamazaki. The team would reappear in &quot;The King of Fighters 2003&quot; renamed &quot;Outlaw Team&quot;, with Mary (now part of the Women Fighters Team) replaced by Gato from &quot;Mark of the Wolves&quot;. Geese also appears in &quot;The King of Fighters 2000&quot; as a striker, in the Xbox version of &quot;The King of Fighters 2002&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters XI&quot; as a selectable character, as well as in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;98: Ultimate Match&quot;, which brings back the Boss Team from &quot;&#x27;96&quot;. He is also a playable character in &quot;The King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match&quot;, alongside his &quot;Nightmare&quot; variant. The younger version of Geese from &quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot; also appears as a boss in &quot;The King of Fighters Neowave&quot;. He also returned in &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; as a playable character alongside Billy and his butler, Hein. In the ending, Geese reveals he has not unlocked the secrets of the Jin scrolls yet but these scrolls predicted the events of the tournament.

Outside the main &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; game, he has been present in the spin-offs. In &quot;The King of Fighters Kyo&quot; he appears in South Town where he antagonizes the Bogard brothers as well as the protagonist, Kyo Kusanagi. In &quot;The King of Fighters EX: Neo Blood&quot; Geese organizes a new tournament in order to obtain the power from the participant Iori Yagami. After Iori is defeated, Geese will act as a boss character. In &quot;&quot; and &quot;Regulation A&quot;, Geese is playable under the name of Nightmare Geese. His normal persona appears in the mobile phone game &quot;The King of Fighters All Star&quot; as well as &quot;″98 Ultimate Match Online&quot;. His &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; persona is also available in &quot;Kimi wa Hero&quot;.

Geese appears as a playable guest fighter in &quot;Tekken 7&quot; as downloadable character. He also appeared in Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; as a background character in the King of Fighters Stadium stage and a spirit.

===In other media===
Geese Howard also appears in a trilogy of animated films based on the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; video games, where his voice is provided by Hidekatsu Shibata in the original Japanese versions and Ward Perry in the English dubs. The first two installments, 1992&#x27;s &quot;Fatal Fury: Legend of the Hungry Wolf&quot; and 1993&#x27;s &quot;Fatal Fury 2: The New Battle&quot;, both aired in Japan as TV specials on Fuji TV, while the third film, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture&quot;, was a theatrical film. The English adaptations of all three films were released on home video by Viz Communications. The first two films loosely follows the storyline of the games and both feature Geese as a major character, establishing him and Wolfgang Krauser as half-brothers who share the same father, a plot element which was used in the video game series with &quot;Fatal Fury Special&quot;. Geese makes a cameo appearance in the third film.

In addition to appearing in manga adaptations of the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;, &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; games published in Japan, Geese Howard was also the subject of a single-volume manga published in 1996 titled &quot;The Geese Howard Story&quot; by Etsuya Amajishi, adapting the character&#x27;s fictional history from the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; and &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; games. It was followed by a single-volume sequel in 1997 titled &quot;Geese in the Dark&quot;, by the same author. Geese also appears in many CD dramas and stars in his own character image album. He also sings in a number of image songs. In the CGI adaptation of &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;, Geese reprises his role from &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; with one episode showing his background and how he met Jeff Bogard, Terry and Andy&#x27;s father.

==Critical reception==
Geese has been well received by gamers, ranking high in several popularity polls. In Gamest&#x27;s 1997 Heroes Collection, Geese was voted as the staff&#x27;s ninth favorite character. In the character popularity poll on Neo Geo Freak&#x27;s website, he was voted as the thirteenth favorite character with a total of 903 votes. While interviewing Shane Bettenhausen, Ignition Entertainment&#x27;s Director of Business Development, Alex Lucard from Diehardgamefan.com mentioned that one of the characters he wanted to be playable in &quot;The King of Fighters XII&quot; was Geese. Video games publications have added praise and criticism on Geese&#x27;s character. Den of Geek listed him as the fifth best &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; character commenting he is likable despite being an antagonist as well his moves that allow him to counter enemies&#x27; attacks. &quot;GameAxis Unwired&quot; found the character as one of the most challenging ones, comparing him with other SNK bosses Wolfgang Krauser and Rugal Bernstein, finding the latter more difficult to beat though. &quot;Complex&quot; listed him as one of the most challenging bosses in gaming, citing the focus of his fights as well as how the character is hated by many other ones in the story. In 2018, Geese was voted as the second most popular Neo Geo character behind Terry.

GameSpot reviewer Frank Provo comments that Geese&#x27;s introduction in &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; is one of the biggest accomplishments from the game as he notes how Geese continues appearing in other games. Avi Krebs from Gamingexcellence.com noted that Geese was the hardest character of the series to defeat and jokingly commented that even though he fights &quot;while wearing a wristwatch, he pulls out all the tricks possible&quot;. IGN writer Ryan Clements agreed with Avi Krebs saying that Geese is &quot;almost physically impossible to beat&quot;. He also mentioned that due to how difficult Geese is, almost twelve different IGN people had to help Clements to win, being only able to defeat him &quot;resorting to the cheapest, most absurd tactics possible&quot;. ScrewAttack likewise said he was ridiculously difficult to beat. Eric Bratcher from GamesRadar commented that Geese is &quot;the big hook&quot; from the series along with Terry Bogard, labelling Geese as &quot;nearly un-killable&quot;. While reviewing &quot;The King of Fighters Neowave&quot; Gamer 2.0&#x27;s Patrick Mifflin found that Geese is the &quot;first SNK true villain&quot;, and commented that his young appearance featured in such game &quot;can surely be chalked up to being one of the perks of a fighting game that has no story at all&quot;. The Nightmare Geese version from &quot;The King of Fighters 2002: Unlimited Match&quot; was compared with &quot;Street Fighter&quot;″s Shin Akuma in terms of difficulties by Eurogamer writer Matt Edwards who described him as one of the strongest opponents in the game. Geese was also in GameSpot&#x27;s &quot;All Time Greatest Villains&quot; losing to Mother Brain from the &quot;Metroid&quot;. Greg Kasavin from the same site listed his &quot;Knockdown Throw&quot; special move as the third best move in fighting games commenting that it was one of the first reversal moves ever made in video games way before they became popular. For this reason, Kasavin stated that Geese became &quot;one of the greatest fighting game characters of all time&quot;. For &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot;, GNN Gamer praised the long-standing rivalry between Ryo and Geese Howard as they keep having special interactions like in &quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot; before their fight and SNK promoted them by making a trailer that showcases their appealing moves. The Gamer commented that while Geese dies in &quot;Real Bout Fatal Fury&quot;, his returns in &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; with &quot;XV&quot; retaining scrolls with potential for immortality have potential to revive him like other villains in gaming who die several times like Dracula from &quot;Castlevania&quot;. Red Bull regarded Geese as one of the &quot;cheapest&quot; fighting game characters for the challenges he gives the players enough to annoy them. Comic Book Resources praised him not only for his iconic role in &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; due to his antagonism with Terry and Andy but how he often appears in &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; as a challenging boss.

As by time in the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series that Geese&#x27;s son, Rock Howard, becomes playable Geese is dead, the two never fought. However, some crossovers that featured these two characters have been praised for providing this desire encounter. Gamesarefun.com writer Andrew McClure noted that although Rock&#x27;s moves to be a cross between Terry Bogard and Geese with the exception of Geese&#x27;s &quot;pretzel&quot; strongest moves.

Raphael See criticized Geese&#x27;s final fight against Terry Bogard in the series&#x27; first original video animation as due to the chi-like techniques performed by the two fighters rather than actual regular martial arts. Upon his addition to &quot;Tekken 7&quot; as downloadable content, Suriel Vazquez from &quot;Game Informer&quot; said Geese would be a good addition despite not being his &quot;favorite Howard&quot;. Gavin Jasper from Den of Geek found Geese&#x27;s reveal as surprising due to lack of possibilities the character would appear as a guest. Nevertheless, he found Geese would fit into the cast as various &quot;Tekken&quot; are poor parents, specifically comparing him with &quot;Tekken&quot;″s character Heihachi Mishima due to their actions across their respective series. Similarly, Polygon found Geese &quot;legendary&quot; and found this crossover between SNK and Namco as this was the first time a character from the SNK&#x27;s games appeared into one of Namco. VideoGamer.com said that while Geese is &quot;a bit of a horrible bastard really, but in a game like this &quot;[Tekken 7]&quot;, that means fun&quot;. HardcoreGamer praised the translation of Geese&#x27;s techniques into the trailer as well as his design as provided by the Unreal Engine 4 commenting that they are &quot;really shining when it comes to his facial expressions and extensive body scarring&quot;. &quot;Game Axis&quot; shared similar comments and liked how &quot;Tekken&quot; gathered villains from the other games with the first one being Akuma.

<text>Xochitepec is a &quot;municipio&quot; (municipality) of the state of Morelos, in central Mexico. Xochitepec is also the name of its principal township and seat of the municipal government. It is located approximately 13 km (8.1 mi) to the south of the capital of Morelos, Cuernavaca, on the southern outskirts of that city&#x27;s greater metropolitan area.

The municipality reported 68,984 inhabitants in the year 2015 census. 1.65% of the population speak an indigenous language.

The toponym &quot;Xochitepec &quot; comes from the Nahuatl language, meaning &quot;on the hill of flowers&quot;. The name may refer to a buried pyramid located at Kilometer 92 along the Mexico City-Acapulco highway, or it could refer to a hill in the center of the city that serves as the pedestal for a public clock.

==History==
===Prehispanic History===
Excavations in Zazacatla show the area was inhabited between 800-500 BCE. Xochicalco was inhabited from A.D. 200, with its peak from A.D. 700-900. Tlahuica settlements date from the 14th century.

===Colonial Period===
Spanish evangelization began in the 16th century, including the construction of the monastery of &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot; (St. John the Baptist) and the Hacienda of &quot;Santa Catarina&quot; in Chiconcuac. &quot;Villa Señor y Sánchez&quot; reports in 1746 that Xochitepec had 35 indigenous families and 16 Spanish families. Churches were also built in Atlacholoaya and Alpuyeca.

During the 18th century the hacienda of Temixco seized lands that belonged to Xochitepec.

At this time, Xochitepec was part of the province of Mexico City.

===19th Century===
A strong earthquake in 1847 opened a sulfurous spring in San Ramon, Chiconcuac, in 1847. The site is a water park today.

In 1848, indigenous from Xochitepec were sentenced to garrote &quot;vil&quot; (a type of torture and execution) for rebelling against &quot;Hacienda Chiconcuac&quot; over a land dispute. Soldiers of Alvarez (&quot;Los Pintos&quot;) assaulted the Hacienda of Chiconcuac in 1856.

Xochitepec was taken over by Republican forces in 1863.

===20th Century===
Following Madero&#x27;s call to arms in 1910, followers of Manuel Asúnsolo advanced on Xochitepec and Cuernavaca in 1911. In retaliation for Zapata&#x27;s 1913 manifestation calling Victoriano Huerta an &quot;usurper&quot;, General Robles burned Xochitepec and other towns in Morelos.

In 1967, Claudia Ochoa Carrillo was the first woman elected &quot;Presidente Municipal&quot; (mayor) in Morelos.

===21st Century===

Alberto Sánchez Ortega (PRI) was elected Presidente Municipal in 2018.

On March 27, 2019, former Atlacholoaya municipal police officer Juan Carlos Reyes Lara was found guilty of the kidnapping of the teacher Albino Quiroz Sandoval. Quiroz Sandoval, 70, was last seen in Tepoztlan on March 16, 2017.

As of May 4, 2020, there were 505 infections and 59 deaths in the state of Morelos and four confirmed infections from the COVID-19 pandemic in Xochitepec. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. On July 2, Xochitepec reported 36 infections and five deaths from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. Xochitepec reported 151 cases, 106 recuperations, and 31 deaths from the virus as of August 31. Two hundred and forty-two cases were reported on December 27, 2020.

===Pyramids===
====Xochicalco====

Xochicalco is the most important archaeological site in Morelos. The main ceremonial center is atop an artificially leveled hill, with remains of residential structures, mostly unexcavated, on long terraces covering the slopes. The site was first occupied by 200 BC but did not develop into an urban center until the Epiclassic period (AD 700 – 900). In addition to pyramids, there are three ballparks, an observatory, and a &quot;temazcal&quot; (ritual steam bath). At its peak, the city may have had a population of up to 20,000 people. The site is located in the municipalities of Temixco and Xochitepec and includes a museum with six exhibit halls.

====Zazacatla====
In June 2006 a research team from Mexico&#x27;s National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) began excavations at Zazacatla, a pre-Columbian Mesoamerican archaeological site located within the municipal boundaries. The INAH team led by Giselle Canto reported finding evidence of Olmec cultural influences at the site. Prior to the find Olmec-influenced statuary and architecture had been almost completely unknown for other sites in the western Morelos region, and Zazacatla&#x27;s excavation represents the strongest evidence yet for some form of trade or contact between the area and the &quot;Olmec heartland&quot; in the Gulf Coast region, some 400 km (249 mi) to the east.

In January 2007 the governor of Morelos, Marco Adame Castillo, announced an offer for the state to underwrite the preservation of Zazacatla and to incorporate it into the tourism and cultural heritage plans for Morelos. He foreshadowed that a tourism project would be initiated at the site&#x27;s location in Xochitepec once the archaeological investigations had further developed.

<text>Yautepec is a municipality located in the north-central part of the Mexican state of Morelos. The municipal seat is the city of Yautepec de Zaragoza. It stands at .

The city serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of Yautepec. In the 2020 census the municipality had a population of 105,780, the fifth-largest community in the state in population (after Cuernavaca, Jiutepec, Cuautla, and Temixco). The municipality, which has an area of reported 102,690 inhabitants in the 2015 census. Yautepec de Zaragoza had 44,353 inhabitants in 2020.

Other large towns in the municipality are La Joya (population 14,126), Cocoyoc (population 10,178), Oaxtepec (population 7,097), Los Arcos (San Carlos) (population 5,736), Oacalco (population 2,543), Lázaro Cárdenas (El Empalme) (population 1,503), Itzamatitlán (population 1,366), Corral Grande (population 1,189), San Isidro (population 1,153), Ignacio Bastida (Santa Catarina Tlayca) (population 1,119), and La Nopalera (population 1,005).

Yautepec, has its etymological roots derived from &quot;Yautli&quot;: Bright-colored plant with an aniseed flavor and yellow flowers in bouquets that indigenous people used for cleansing baths; &quot;Tepe-tl&quot;: (hill) and &quot;k&quot; contraction of &quot;Ko&quot;: (adverb of place); it means &quot;On the hill of the pericón flower&quot; in English. President Benito Juarez changed the name from &quot;La villa de Yautepec de Gómez Farías&quot; to &quot;Yautepec de Zaragoza&quot; (of Zaragoza) in 1869 in honor of General Ignacio Zaragoza, the general who had led the Cinco de Mayo, 1862, victory over the invading French forces in Puebla.

==History==
The mythical love story of Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl is well-known. What is less known is that the princess&#x27;s father preferred she date the King of Yautepec, which she did on at least one occasion.

===Prehispanic history===
Francisco Plancarte y Navarrete, Cuernavaca&#x27;s second bishop (1898–1911), wrote &quot;Tamoanchan—El Estado de Morelos y El Principio de la Civilizacion en Mexico&quot; in 1911. In it, he proposes that the first agriculturally based settlements in Mexico appeared around 1500 BCE in a place called &quot;Tamoanchan&quot; which he associates with Morelos. While later archaeologists do not mention Tamoanchan, the remains of an elephant-like animal dating back 6,000 years, have been found near Yautepec. These remains can be seen at the &quot;Museo Regional Cuauhnahuac&quot; (Palace of Cortes) in Cuernavaca.

The earliest findings are on the hill of &quot;Atlihuayán&quot;; the first settlers in the region were the Olmec. The Olmec were nomads, living from hunting, fishing, as well as gathering roots and wild fruit. Archaeologists Valentín López González and Ramón Piña Chan, have found an Atlihuayan figurine, now exhibited in the National Museum of Anthropology and History in Mexico City. Also, nine pyramids and a ball court have been found in &quot;Itzamatitlán&quot;.

Yautepec and the entire Morelos Valley had a subordinate role in Mesoamerican history. From the Classic to the Postclassic the local populations developed under the influence of Teotihuacanos, Toltecas and Nahuas. It is with these last ones that the Valley had a greater relevance in the regional dynamics, since it was occupied by Tlahuica population (Nahuatl language speakers), taking Cuauhnahuac (Cuernavaca) as its capital and expanding its dominion to other zones, including Yautepec. In 1389, the inhabitants of Yautepec, Tetlama, and Jiutepec, fought the Tlahuicas.

After the establishment of the Triple Alliance in 1438, the Tlahuica lordship was conquered and forced to pay tribute to the Mexicas. When Moctezuma I ascended the throne, he set about conquering Yautepec, forcing them to submit to the Lord of Tenochtitlan. Moctezuma built a botanical garden in &quot;Huaxtepec&quot; (Oaxtepec) in (1440–1469).

===Conquest &amp; colonization===
The conquest of Morelos by the conquistadors under Hernán Cortés was part of the strategy to achieve the ultimate goal: the fall of the Great Tenochtitlán.

Upon the arrival of the Spaniards, the Indigenous groups of the region were divided into two &quot;cacicazgos&quot;: Cuauhnahuac and Huaxtepec. The conquistador sent an expedition to take the town of Ocuituco; later Gonzalo de Sandoval was sent to Yecapixtla. A year later, 1521, Cortes explored the lands submitted by Sandoval, then went to Tlalmanalco and Huaxtepec. After some bloody fights and some peaceful deliveries, including Yautepec, Morelos fell into Spanish hands. Cortes made peace with the &quot;Caciques&quot; in this area prior to his Siege of Tenochtitlan.

Once the military conquest was complete, catechization was carried out by Dominican friars, who began the construction of the convent of the Ascension of the Lord in 1567. It stands out for its simplicity and austerity. This large building is unlike many others, simple in its spatial solutions and form in façade, nave of the temple, tower, and convent cloister. The church is rectangular, long, tall and rather narrow, interrupted in its length by two lateral chapels. The building has a popular Renaissance character. The choral window on the façade is rectangular and possibly the largest one of any 16th-century churches in the state. There is a large but simple bell tower in the southwest corner. The convent emphasizes the austerity and simplicity of the home or abode of the friars. There are no luxuries, no ornamentation and here lies the beauty of this set. On the southeast side is the large open chapel, perhaps the largest of the Indian chapels in the state. This chapel is beautiful although it is semi-destroyed and abandoned.

The Dominican convent of &quot;Santo Domingo&quot; in Oaxtepec was founded by Fray Vicente de Sta. Ma. and Fray Domingo in 1533; it was the first built by that order in Morelos. This church does not have an atrium, and it was built on top of a prehispanic base some three or four meters above the level of the plaza. Both of these monasteries were recognized by the UNESCO as World Heritage Sites in 1994, and are included in the &quot;Ruta de los Conventos&quot;.

While cotton was the most important crop in the pre-conquest era, sugar replaced cotton after the conquest. The sugar cane haciendas of Cocoyoc and Atlihuayán were built in the 17th century. Cocoyoc is a Nahuatl word that means &quot;place of coyotes&quot;. The city of Cocoyoc was founded in the 11th century by the Tlahuicas. After the conquest, Hernán Cortés was named Marquis of Oaxaca in recognition of his services to the Spanish crown. Cortés also married Isabel, daughter of Moctezuma II. In 1614, the Hacienda received a license from the government to establish a sugar factory pulled by horses, in order to grind and process sugarcane. Elviro Ruiz, a descendant of Isabel, sold part of her inheritance to the peasants as farmland, but the hacienda later increased its lands through purchases, negotiations, and marriages. In 1698, the Hacienda consisted of three hundred and sixty-six hectares of irrigated land, a house, a chapel, the &quot;trapiche&quot; (mill) and other buildings necessary for the operation of a sugar plantation. However, it was later reduced by forced sales by fines of tax evasion and other debts, and on more than one occasion the entire property was auctioned off. During the 18th century, Hacienda Cocoyoc was one of the twelve most important sugar mills in the country and by then it had already had numerous owners.

===Independence &amp; 19th century===
The haciendas established at Oacalco, Apanquetzalco, Atlihuayán, San Carlos Borromeo, Cocoyoc and Xochimancas generally prospered into the 19th century, and the Mexican War of Independence (1810–1821) had little direct effect on the lives of the people of Yautepec.

Once Mexico achieved its independence, Yautepec became a community in the district of &quot;Cuautla de las Ampilpas&quot; in the State of Mexico. Over the next 40+ years, the country suffered through power struggles between conservatives (who favored a strong central government) and liberals (who favored a federated government) as well as several foreign invasions. In 1854 this led to the &quot;Plan de Cuernavaca&quot; which led to the ouster of dictator Antonio Santa Anna and in 1857 the Plan de Ayutla and civil war. Yautepec in 1861-1862 is the fictional setting of &quot;El Zarco,&quot; a novel about bandits called &quot;Los Plateados&quot; written by Ignacio Manuel Altamirano and published after his death in 1901. The reality relating to the bandits who thrived during this time of anarchy, however, may not have been as thrilling and romantic as Altamirano suggests.

The town was briefly called, &quot;la Villa de Yautepec de Gomez Farias&quot; in honor of one of the signers of the Plan de Cuernavaca. After the French invasion and the Republic was restored, Morelos became a state in 1869 and Yautepec became a municipality. The city of Yautepec changed its name to &quot;Yautepec de Zaragoza&quot; in honor of general Ignacio Zaragoza, hero of the Battle of Puebla. There is a bust of Zaragoza in &quot;La Plazuela de Leyva&quot; in the town center. The plaza itself is named for &quot;Francisco Leyva&quot;, first Governor of Morelos as Yautepec became the first capital of the state (April 17, 1869). Leyva created the Literary and Scientific Institute of the State of Morelos with preparatory studies in agriculture and veterinary science; trade and administration; Arts and crafts; normal for teachers; and law. A telegraph line between Cuernavaca and Yautepec was laid in 1877 during the administration of Governor Carlos Pacheco.

Peace was restored under the dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz, bringing prosperity to large landowners such as the Escandon family, who had belonged to the court of Emperor Maximilian.

The actress Virginia Fábregas García was born in the Hacienda de Oacalco in the municipality of Yautepec on December 17, 1871. She was the daughter of Ricardo Fábregas of Spanish origin and of Mrs. Ursula García de Figueroa. Her vocation for the theater was manifested from adolescence when the owner of the Hacienda de Apanquetzalco built a theater in the municipal seat which was a silent witness to the first artistic steps of the talented Virginia. As for the hacienda, it went bankrupt and its lands were bought by the Escandon family.

===20th &amp; 21st centuries===

One person died and the church was damaged during the September 19, 2017 earthquake.

Agustín Alonso Gutiérrez (PRD-PSD) was elected Presidente Municipal (mayor) in the July 2018 election.

Mayor Agustín Alonso Gutiérrez announced on March 24 that he and other municipal authorities would donate half their salaries for buy food for low-income families in Yautepec. As of April 20, 2020, there were 12 deaths and 95 confirmed cases in the state, including one death and five cases in Yautepec, numbers that increased to 1,238 cases in the state with 248 deaths on May 25; Yautepec had 26 cases. The state office of DIF sent food and water to vulnerable groups of people in eight municipalities including Yautepec on May 26. On July 2, Yautepec reported 24 infections and five deaths from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. Yautepec reported 178 cases, 135 recuperations, and 35 deaths from the virus as of August 31. Three hundred thirty cases were reported on December 27, 2020. Yautepec reported 462 cases on January 14, 2021, sixth highest in the state.

<doc id="732223" wikidata="Q2732754" url="?curid=732223" title="Yecapixtla">
<text>Yecapixtla ( ) is a town and municipality located in the northeast of the state of Morelos in central Mexico. Yecapixtla means, &quot;Land of men and women with sharp noses&quot;. The town is home to one of the monastery complexes associated with the Monasteries on the Slopes of Popocatépetl World Heritage Site. Yecapixtla is famously known for its tasty, high-quality beef, cecina (cured dry meat).

The population of the municipality is 52,651 according to the 2015 census. The town was hit hard by the September 19, 2017 Puebla earthquake, in which two people died and the church was damaged.

==Town==
The town&#x27;s historic center surrounds the church and former monastery complex of San Juan Bautista. Immediately surrounding it are the four neighborhoods established in 1550: San Pablo, La Concepción, Santa Mónica, and San Esteban. The town center around the monastery complex was divided by a number of arroyos, but most of these have since dried and/or have been filled in. A number of newer neighborhoods such as Mexquemeca, Tlachichilco, Los Reyes, Zahuatlán and La Cruz Verde were originally independent communities that were annexed as the town grew later in its history.
The main facade of the monastery complex is to the west, with the back of it facing the main plaza and municipal palace of the town. The town clock is visible from the main plaza; the clock was placed on one of the monastery&#x27;s back towers by Father Evaristo Nava in the early 20th century. The main plaza is sometimes called the Plaza de Tributación, referring to its pre-Hispanic and early colonial period function as a place to collect tribute such as crops and handcrafted items from the area which is now eastern Morelos state. During the early colonial period, this plaza was part of the monastery complex and continued its tribute collecting function. (forteleza) While the San Juan Bautista Church dominates both the town of Yecapixtla as well as the surrounding municipality, there are a number of other churches such as San Sebastián Mártir, Santiago Apóstol, de la Virgen de Guadalupe, Santo Tomás Apóstol, San Agustín, Nuestro Padre Jesús, Santa Lucía, San Nicolás, San Miguel, Los Reyes, San Marcos, La Santa Cruz, San Pablo, Santa Mónica, La Inmaculada Concepción, Santa Cruz Ecatepec and San Francisco Calapa.

Historically, Yecapixtla has been a regional commercial and governmental center since pre-Hispanic times. In addition to its function as a tribute collection center in the pre-Hispanic and early colonial times, it was also a major crossroads for migrations and other traffic between the Valley of Mexico and points south. The town continues to function as a commercial center, with a weekly regional tianguis (open air market) on Thursday. There is also a weekly market on Mondays dedicated solely to cattle. However, the largest market of the year occurs the last Thursday of October. This market has its origins in the pre-Hispanic festival honoring the birth of Yacapitzauac, a deity which acted as a guide for travelers and protector of merchants. Records indicate that this festival/market has been observed in one form or another since the 1330s. Today, the highlights of this event includes the dance of the Chinelos, and a ballroom dance with features orchestra and popular music. The Feria de Cecina or Cecina Fair is also held on this date, promoting the town and municipality&#x27;s regional specialty of beef cecina as well as dairy products such as cream and cheese. These joint events together are even larger than that of the patron saint, John the Baptist, on 24 June. This event is celebrated for two days with fireworks on frames called &quot;toritos&quot; (little bulls) and &quot;castillos&quot; (small castles), bands playing wind instruments and folk/regional dances from various parts of Morelos and neighboring State of Mexico. Another annual event is the Feria y Exposición Ganadera or Cattle Expo and Fair. In addition to the showing of animals, there are charreada events, bullfights and number of cultural attractions. Today, Yecapixtla still has a large number of religious festivals and other events. Some of the most important occur on New Year&#x27;s Day, Candlemas, Holy Week, especially Maundy Thursday, Day of the Holy Cross (May 3), feast of John the Baptist on 24 June, Day of the Dead and the posadas leading up to Christmas. On the last day of Holy Week, the folk dancers enter the San Juan Bautista Church, make the sign of penitence and then move into the atrium for a day of dancing. Maintaining order during the event are people dressed as Roman soldiers.

In addition to the monastery complex, Yecapixtla is best known for the making and sale of beef cecina, which is a kind of marinated beef. Cecina does not have its origin in Yecapixtla, but it is the area most famous for its production in Mexico. This beef is prepared in large thin sheets of meat, which is then cut and quickly grilled. The favored kind of cecina is a marinated beef, but the pork version coated with chili pepper is consumed also. Yecapixtla calls itself the &quot;World Capital of Cecina.&quot; Traditionally, cecina is eaten with cream and/or cheese from the community of Achichipico.

==Monastery and church of San Juan Bautista==
The site of the church and former monastery of San Juan Bautista was a teocalli, or sacred precinct, dedicated to a god of commerce called Yacapitzauac. This teocalli was destroyed by the Spanish under Gonzalo de Sandoval when he captured and sacked the settlement in 1521. This teocalli and god were the center of the pre-Hispanic community. The Franciscans were the first to arrive in the 1520s to evangelize the local population and they built a small church on the site. However, this church was destroyed in a fire. The Augustinians took over evangelization in the 1530s and formally established the monastery, dedicated to John the Baptist. This figure was chosen because Yacapitzauac was depicted with a staff as a sign of his authority, and John the Baptist is often depicted with a staff. Most of the monastery was constructed between 1535 and 1540. At that time, there was sufficient income to the order to not only finish much of the monastery in a short time, but also to add a number of fine details. Construction of a number of smaller elements continued until 1586. The complex presents similarities with others built by the Augustinians in eastern Morelos at this time, such as a stone wall around the perimeter and the use of merlons, which give these monasteries the look of a medieval castle. Due to the diminishing importance of Yecapixtla, the monastery was mostly abandoned by the 17th century, with the Augustinians losing formal control of the church and community in the mid 18th century. The complex remained mostly untouched until the late 19th century when Father José Pilar Sandoval did some remodeling work in the main nave of the church. More restoration work was undertaken by Father Evaristo Nava in the early 20th century, which included the addition of an organ and changing the sacristy into a tabernacle. In 1994, the complex became part of the Monasteries on the slopes of Popocatépetl World Heritage Site.

As common to monasteries of the time, the complex is fronted by a very large atrium. This atrium is surrounded by a stone wall topped with merlons. The main entrance to the atrium from the street has merlons, as well as the chapels found on each of the wall&#x27;s four corners. From the main entrance to the church, there is a volcanic stone walkway, divided by an atrium cross, which has a heart, a chalice and a depiction of the Host in low relief. The atrium cross is not the original. The original was broken by a child in 1961 when he was trying to climb onto its base. The cross fell onto the child killing him. Along the atrium walls on the inside, there are a number of empty niches that remain, which probably held images related to the Stations of the Cross. Access to the chapels in the corners, called capillas posas, is in the atrium. These chapels’ primary function was the house the Host during processions on Corpus Christi.

At the back of the atrium is the complex which consists of a large church and cloister. The front of the church has a very tall facade, which is mostly undecorated, flanked by two corner buttresses and topped by a small recessed tower. Along the top of the facade and on this tower, there are merlons. The church also has a bell tower, but it is somewhat recessed from the facade and is also topped with merlons. Under the cornice, there is a frieze which divides into two parts. On the right-hand side, there is the date of 1526 depicted in Aztec style, when the Franciscans arrived, accompanied by the coat of arms of that order. On the left is the year in which the pre-Hispanic teocalli was destroyed.

Between the merlons and the main portal, there is a Gothic rose window and below this is the main portal with subtle design work. The rose window stands out most. It is a circular stone which was cut in a floral-like pattern to let in light, surrounded by a frame with elaborate ornamentation. It is one of very few rose windows in Mexico from this time period. While the overall style of the window is Plateresque Gothic, it was fashioned by indigenous hands. It contains indigenous elements as well. The &quot;flower&quot; in the center indicates the four cardinal directions and the twenty cherubs in the frame surrounding it represents the days of the month of the Aztec calendar. This frame also contains the bust of a bound woman who probably represents the mother of Huitzilopochtli.

The portal is a simple arch with subtle reliefs with small angels, cherubs and vegetative motifs on the archivolt as well as portraits of saints and friars. One of these portraits may be &quot;Jorge de Avile y Ro&quot;, the founder of the monastery. On the left side there is a portrait of a layperson with a Roman-style haircut, who was probably the architect. The wooden doorjambs are decorated with the heads of angels and rose patterns as well as vegetative motifs. The bars on the main doors were added in 1910 by Father Evaristo Nava, who also donated the clock that can be seen on the complex&#x27;s back tower. Around the arch and the doors, the portal is sculpted in both a detailed and subtle way. To the side of the doorway, there are two pairs of pilasters. These are in Renaissance style while the rest of the portal mixes Gothic and Plateresque. However, the columns also have channels which are more often associated with the later Churrigueresque. At the base of the columns there are busts of Saint Ambrose, bishop of Milan and Cicero, who was an influence on the philosophy of Saint Augustine. The pilasters are topped with capitals, which support a frieze that contains reliefs of small angels flying with a cross in the center. Above the frieze, there is a panel with a niche, today empty, flanked by the coats of arms of the Augustinians and the Franciscans. Underneath the coats of arms, there is an angel riding a dragon. Topping this is a pediment.

The northeast side of the church is marked by a long wall with three Gothic windows and the side portal in Renaissance style. This is the portal most often used by parishioners as it is closest to what is now the main plaza of the town. This portal has a barrel arch flanked by two sets of pilasters. Between the sets, there are very worn decorative details, including two medallions. These are notable because they depict a man and a woman in civil attire with no religious aspect. The archivolt of the arch contains bundles of spears tied with different elements. In the center of one of these bundles, there is a heart, a symbol of the Augustinians. A cornice encloses the area.

The main entrance of the church leads into space under the choir area, which is covered by a Gothic vault with nerves that form the shape of a star. The highly stylized murals painted in black on the side walls have been retouched. They consist of bands of decorations with contains elements such as letters, niches, and coats of arms. This entrance area ends with an arch that opens into the main nave. This area serves as the baptistery and contains three monolithic pieces, which originally were part of the teocalli. The first two are used for baptisms. The first is the large basin to hold water for baptism. The second, called a &quot;piscina&quot; is meant to receive the water that pours off the head of the one being baptized. On the outside of the main basin, there are the heads of animals and humans, which may indicate that the bowl was originally part of a fountain, readapted to its current function. The heads that protrude indicate the duality of life with the masculine represented by a jaguar and the feminine represented by a woman. The use of a jaguar symbol indicates Olmec influence. Next to these two, there is a small pillar with worn, unidentifiable designs, whose purpose are unknown.

A small door in the entrance area covers a stairway that leads to the choir area above. This choir area contains medieval style murals and a balustrade with a crest of &quot;Fleur-de-lis&quot; sculpted of sandstone. It also contains an organ similar to the ones used in medieval European cathedrals, and is the only one of its kind in the Augustinian monasteries of the region. The only other one in the region is in the originally Franciscan cathedral of Cuernavaca. It was donated by &quot;Evaristo Nava&quot; in 1915, using the money he was saving to go to the Holy Land.

The main nave is enormous and very tall. At the front is an apse, which like the area under the choir has a vault with Gothic nerves which form a star pattern. The current main altar found here is not the original. The original altar was Baroque which contained twelve paintings with each of the Apostles as well as one of John the Baptist and Saint Augustine. These paintings have since been moved to the pinacotheca of the Cuernavaca cathedral. The current altar is a large white 19th century Neoclassical style piece, inspired by a Roman mausoleum. It has two levels on a circular base with a Corinthian-style capital. It features an image of John the Baptist.

Most of the original mural work that covered the walls and ceilings are deteriorated or lost, but reconstructed murals have been added to parts, especially in the spaces between the nerves of the vaults. These murals contain soft colors which form lines, geometrical shapes and floral shapes reminiscent of ironwork. These probably date to the last third of the 19th century but this is mostly conjecture. The side walls contain faded remnants of narrative scenes, which have not been dated either. One of the best-conserved elements inside the church is the 16th-century pulpit, made of sandstone sculpted with fine Gothic style designs. In each of the faces of the design, anagrams of the name of Christ or the coat of arms of the Augustinians appear. There is none like it from all of the Mexican colonial period. The original confession booths are built into the wall on the right side of the nave, separating the church and the cloister, with the priest entering one side and the confessor entering through the other. They were covered up for much of the church&#x27;s history until 1954 when Father Jose Maria Mendez moved the altars on this wall to reveal them. Between them and the baptistery area, there is a large door that leads to the cloister of the former monastery. In colonial times, this door was only opened for Mass on major festivals.

The facade of the cloister has two levels and is fronted by an arched porch area, called a portería. Above the portería, there are two windows, and the remains of the pilasters of an arch that corresponds to the open chapel, which was like a balcony. However, this balcony area was eventually walled in to make more interior space. The portería contains two arches and a frieze adorned with round forms which protrude. The portería contains the main entrance to the cloister area, above which is a crucifix set on top of a skull, which represents Calvary. The foyer of this entrance used to serve as a baptistery in the late 19th and early 20th century. The paintings here are from that era. They depict stories about the Virgin Mary who is shown with the infant Jesus in her arms and symbols of the Trinity around them.

Inside, the cloister has only one floor that surrounds a central courtyard, separated by sixteen simple arches which have buttresses. On the interior of each arch, there are dark red circles, which are all that remain of medallions which probably had religious anagrams. In the center of the courtyard, there is a fountain and a sundial etched onto a pillar. There are two main interior portals, one that leads to the refectory and the other that leads to the current priest&#x27;s quarters. Like other cloisters of this area and time, there are remnants of mural work. Near the large doorway to the church, there is a group of four saints done in black and white, which look upon a scene which has since been lost. There are areas that conserve parts of friezes with images drawn in white over a black background, especially in the upper parts of the walls. Images of saints appear on the spaces between the arches, which are drawn to simulate sculptures contained in niches with Plateresque columns and topped with shells. In one corner, there is a seated figure of a sainted pope, whose face and eyes are well done. Most of the rest of the paintings are narratives, but most of the work has been partially or fully lost, and those that remain are not in good condition. One exception is a depiction of the road to Calvary and the Crucifixion. The vaults of the passageways are decorated with coffers, some of which are hexagons, which may indicate the influence of Italian architect Sebastian Serlio. The Sala de Profundis, or meditation room, contains well-preserved multichromatic murals which depict a large number of saints including a series of martyrs and a depiction of Saint Augustine. These images are in the process of restoration by the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia. In the south wing of the cloister there is an entrance to an underground area, which tradition says used to lead to Hernán Cortés’ house, but since destroyed. There is also a door that leads to the garden area, which grew food for the monks. Fruit trees bearing mangos, guavas, coffee, limes, oranges and plums and more still grow here. It is one of the few monasteries which still has its garden area, although it is greatly diminished.

Missing from the view are the kitchen area and latrines. It is thought that the Chapel of San José, now opening into the church, was originally the kitchen of the monastery. This chapel is known to have existed in this form at least since the 19th century. The monastery has an archive which dates back to the year 1600, which mostly records baptisms, confirmations, marriages and deaths of the local population. During the Mexican Revolution, this archive was sealed behind a wall in order to avoid its destruction.

==History==

===Pre-hispanic era===

The name Yecapixtla has been translated in a number of ways. Several sources claim that the name refers to the wearing of a stone called a &quot;chalchuihite&quot; through the nose, translating to &quot;land of pierced noses.&quot; This was indeed practiced in the area among pre-Hispanic governors as a sign of their status. This translation may come from documents written by Gutierrez de Lievana from 1580. The Aztec glyph of the area does show a pierced nose. The government of Morelos claims that the name translates to &quot;land of gentle airs&quot; referring to the calm weather and lack of strong winds. The glyph also contains a flying insect which could allude to this. However, the name is very close to the name of a god of commerce, Yacapitzauac, whose teocalli was the center of the pre-Hispanic settlement. This teocalli was destroyed by the Spanish and a church dedicated to John the Baptist put in its place.

The eastern portion of what is now Morelos state had been settled since the Olmec period, and this culture controlled most of the area through the main settlement of Chalcatzingo. It is also known that groups of Chalcas and Xochimilcas passed through. Xochimilcas and Tlahuicas came to settle around 1325. Yecapixtla itself was established by a group of Xochimilcas. This same area of Morelos was conquered by Moctezuma I in 1440, and Yecapixtla became a tributary collection center for the Aztecs due to its strategic position in the basin of the Amatzinac River. The Aztecs called this settlement Tlalnahuac.

===Conquest and colonial period===

During the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, a few months before the fall of Tenochtitlan, Spanish soldiers under Gonzalo de Sandoval came to Yecapixtla to conquer it. Sandoval arrived to the settlement from Huejotzingo, bringing warriors from this place, which had been a traditional enemy of Yecapixtla. The battle between Spanish and local eagle warriors took place at the &quot;Xaplan&quot; ravine on 15 March 1521, and the town resisted the invaders fiercely. However, the warriors were unable to withstand the Spaniards’ superior weapons and the eagle warrior dynasty of this area was destroyed. The remaining warriors retreated from Yecapixtla permanently, but some went to Tenochtitlan to defend it. The victorious Spanish sacked, destroyed and killed many in the town.

Yecapixtla lay in ruins, but Hernán Cortés had interest in it and the surrounding area because of the well-established tribute collection system and the land&#x27;s aptitude for fruit orchards. Cortés built a house in the town and laid claim to the area. However, the first colonial government in Mexico City gave the lands in the area to Diego de Olguín. Cortés left for Spain in 1529, making the area an encomienda called &quot;Tlalnahuac&quot;, which included fourteen communities including Yecapixtla. When Cortés returned from Spain, he carried a seal making him the Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca, giving him possession of large swaths of land, including the Yecapixtla area and four others in Morelos. The Cortés family would keep these lands through the rest of the 16th century. Yecapixtla kept its function as a tribute collection center and became a commercial center, especially for the cattle trade.

The first missionaries to the areas were the Franciscans, who arrived and built a small church in 1525. In the 1530s, they were replaced by the Augustinians. This order began to construct the monastery complex which remains to this day. It was mostly built over a period of five years, from 1535 to 1540, made possible by the income provided by the settlement&#x27;s status as a tribute collection center. The monastery and town was dedicated to John the Baptist. He was chosen because he is often depicted with a cloak, sandals and staff, much like the pre-Hispanic patron of the settlement, Yecapetzauac. After the monastery was built, it became a regional administrative center because of its location along a number of commercial routes. The town of Yecapixtla was reorganized around the monastery complex in 1550, into four neighborhoods: San Pablo, La Concepción, Santa Mónica and San Esteban, which still exist. These roughly correspond to the pre-Hispanic organization of the town, but it was much reduced in size due to population loss, especially on the south side. The town at that time was crisscrossed by arroyos and ravines spanned by small bridges, especially around the monastery, but since then many have dried out and filled in.

Depopulation continued at the end of the 16th and early 17th centuries, and the monastery&#x27;s importance diminished. By the end of this time, the monastery was all but abandoned, as Cuautla grew and became the regional center. In the 17th century, those who had land rights under what were called &quot;primordial title&quot; began to struggle with Spanish owned haciendas over surface water. Much of the land in the municipality is not suited for the growing of crops but is instead suited for the raising of livestock, especially cattle. For this reason, the area&#x27;s industry in providing beef and dairy products such as cream and cheese began relatively early in the colonial period. Orchards established in the very early colonial period were still important. There was another period of depopulation in the 18th century when many residents went to work in haciendas in Cuautla and other areas in Morelos.

In the 18th century, the Augustinians officially lost control of the monastery complex and the population to regular clergy in 1754. During this time, many of the popular religious festivals such as the Semana de San Juan (Week of Saint John) and Day of the Dead became established in the town and surrounding area, often encouraged by the new clergy. The development and growth of local religious festivals would continue through the rest of the colonial period and into the 19th century, through the establishment of brotherhoods (cofradías) dedicated to a particular saint or another religious element.

===Independence and 19th century===

Because of its strategic position between the Mexico City area and points south, armies associated with the Mexican War of Independence, Reform War and Mexican Revolution all passed through here. In 1810, Yecapixtla was part of the Jonacatepec municipality. It became an independent municipality in 1869.

For a brief period in the late 19th century, Yecapixtla experienced a surge in economic development when a railway was built through connecting it to Mexico City through what is now the eastern panhandle of the State of Mexico. Electricity and telephone were introduced. During this time Evaristo Navo was the head clergyman in the area and is credited with a number of developments including a parish school, the installation of a church organ, with accompanying encouragement of musical training. He also installed the clock on the San Juan Bautista Church. One purpose of the parish school was to preserve and in some cases restitute old traditions which had been lost due to the Liberal reforms of the latter 19th century.

===Revolution and 20th century===

The parish school closed in 1911. Further attempts to keep older traditions alive were headed by Juventino Pineda Enriquez who created the &quot;Misiones Culturales&quot; (Cultural Missions).

The town shrank again in population due to the Mexican Revolution, with men going off to fight and the remaining women and children dispersing, with some going to Mexico City. The war ruined the town&#x27;s economy and after the war, many families who had left never returned. After the war, agriculture returned when an ejido was established to the south of the town and slowly the town recovered. Development remained slow until the mid-20th century when new infrastructure such as the reestablishment of electricity and telephone, a new highway and a bank allowed for more economic contact with the outside. The new infrastructure attracted new residents. Public schools were opened in the 1930s and 1940s. An agricultural technical school was opened in 1972.

===21st century===
Yecapixtla and surrounding communities were hit hard in a September 19, 2017 earthquake, when two people died and the church was damaged. According to the Secretary of Health, 324 homes were destroyed and another 413 were damaged in the municipality.

Francisco Erik Sanchez Zavala of the Morelos First coalition PAN was elected Presidente Municipal (mayor) on July 1, 2018.

The federal government held a referendum on February 23−24, 2019, to decide whether to build a thermoelectric plant and a gas pipeline in Huexca. Voters in Morelos and parts of the states of Puebla and Tlaxcala were asked if they supported the completion of $22 billion peso (U.S.$1.6 billion) plant completed in September 2017 but not put into operation due to lack of connection to the Cuautla River. Samir Flores Soberanes, a leading opponent of the plant was murdered and there were violent protests during the public consultation. 59.5% of the 55,715 citizens voted in favor of construction, and 40.1% voted against. A number of safety and environmental factors have not yet been resolved. Construction was restarted in September 2020 after a halt to deal with environmental problems; the plant is due to open by the end of 2020 after an investment of MXN $20 billion (US$939 million). The National Guard was used to break up a group of demonstrators in Apatlaco who were protesting against the use of water resources from the Cuautla River for the thermoelectric plant. The protesters also argued that President López Obrador had promised to oppose the project during his presidential campaign.

The state of Morelos reported 209 cases and 28 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico as of April 27, 2020; two cases were reported in Yecapixtla. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. On June 2, Yecapixtla reported 55 infections and four deaths from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. It was reported on June 11 that the number of atypical pneumonia deaths has doubled, and it is suspected that many of these are related to individuals who died from COVID-19 at home without being tested for the disease in a hospital. Yecapixtla reported 113 cases, 95 recuperations, and 17 deaths from the virus as of August 31. One hundred ninety cases were reported on December 27, 2020.

Human body parts were discovered in a hidden grave in Colonia Mixtlalcingo on June 7, 2020.

==Municipality==
As municipal seat, the town of Yecapixtla is the local governing authority for over 100 named communities which cover a territory of 192.33km2. About 36% of the municipal population of 39,859 lives in the town proper. As of 2005, there were 363 people who spoke an indigenous language, down from 420 in 2000. Population growth in the municipality has been historically erratic. In recent years, it has grown due to migration into eastern Morelos from other parts of Mexico. The overwhelming majority consider themselves to be Catholic although there is a small Evangelical community and a small number of the Jewish faith. Aside from the seat, other important communities include Achichipico, Adolfo López Mateos, Aquiles Serdán, Capulines, Huesca, Juan Morales, Los Limones, Los Reyes, Mexquemeca, Pazulco, Tecajec, Texcala, Tezontetelco, Tlamomulco, Xochitlán, Yecapixteca and Zahuatlan. The municipality borders the municipalities of Ocuituco, Zacualpan, Temoac, Ayala, Cuautla and Atlatlahucan with the State of Mexico to the north.

The area is part of the slopes around the Popocatépetl volcano. The highest elevations are in the north, descending gradually to the south, east, and west. Major elevations include Yoteco (2110 masl), Boyero (1824 masl) and Mirador (1882 masl). There are formations of volcanic rock, including basalt. Surface water consists of runoff from Popocatepetl into streams and small rivers, many of which have formed deep ravines such as the one named Yecapixtla, which begins in the State of Mexico and passes through Zahuatlán and Mexquemeca. before emptying into the Cuautla River. Other streams include &quot;Arcos de Ortiz, Malpaso&quot; or &quot;La Cuera&quot; and &quot;Del Negro&quot;. Other named ravines in the territory include &quot;Xococotla, Atlamaxa, Las Animas, Tepanche, Xalpa, Tamalera&quot;, and &quot;Remudadero&quot;. There are also a number of freshwater springs such as &quot;Chirimoyo, Las Pilas, La Tenería, La Mora&quot;, and &quot;Tepetlapa&quot;. In general, the climate is warm and humid with rains falling principally from June to October. Average temperature is 19.6 °C, and annual rainfall is between 800 and 1000mm. There is little difference among the seasons in temperature. Overall, the north tends to be somewhat cooler than the south due to altitude. Much of the municipality is covered in pine and holm oak forest, with some other species such as amate (a type of fig) tree, casahuates and guamuchiles. Most other vegetation is deciduous. Most of the area&#x27;s wildlife has been extinguished with only various insects and reptiles to be found wild.

The municipality has two primary economic activities, the making of cecina and other beef products and agriculture/livestock. There is also a small pottery industry. About 5,800 hectares are under cultivation, with about 2,600 used for grazing and 8,707 as forest. About two-thirds of the land in the municipality is owned communally in ejidos or other arrangements. The rest is privately owned. About 94.7% of the agricultural land is used for agriculture and livestock, with about 32% still considered to have a significant amount of wild vegetation. Almost all crops (97.8%) are grown during the rainy season. Principle crops include corn, sorghum and tomatoes. About 2.2% of the crops are perennials and include avocados and coffee. Most of the livestock raised is cattle (mostly dairy) and domestic fowl. The municipality accounts for 6.3% of the total agricultural output of the state. There are deposits of sand, stone and gravel for construction. There is also a small industrial park which provides employment for the area.

<text>Zacatepec de Hidalgo (Zacatepec from the Nahuatl Zacatl meaning grass and tepetl meaning hill, thus loosely meaning &quot;grassy hill&quot;) is a town in the state of Morelos, Mexico. It is bordered by Puente de Ixtla, Tlaltizapán, Tlaquiltenango and Jojutla. Miguel Hidalgo was the priest whose call to arms on September 16, 1810, led to the Mexican War of Independence.

The town serves as the local seat for the government, with which it shares the name. The municipality reported 36,159 inhabitants in the 2015 census.

The main industry in the town and its surrounding countryside is that of sugar cane cultivation and processing. The most noticeable feature of the town is the sugar mill located in its center and during operating hours the air of the settlement is laden with the sickly-sweet smell of sugar.

Students come from surrounding parts of Morelos to study at the public university, the Instituto Tecnológico de Zacatepc, which is located on a site adjacent to the sugar mill.

==History==

In pre-Columbian times Zacatepec was under the Tlahuica lordship of Cuauhnahuac (Cuernavaca). According to the tribute registration and to the list of tributary towns to Texcoco, analyzed by Blanca Maldonado, Zacatepec and Tetelpa were characterized by being a cotton-producing town with irrigation infrastructure tribute to the Triple Alliance (Acolhuas, Tepanecas, and Mexicas) dominant in the Valley of Mexico, from its total subordination in the year of 1437 during the Itzcoatl Empire.

After the conquest, Zacatepec fell under the jurisdiction of the Count of Oaxaca. After the Spanish conquest, evangelization of the area was the responsibility of the convent of Santo Domingo de Tlaquiltenango. In 1619, Pedro Cortés, Marqués del Valle, granted Juan Fernández Moradillo, 200 hectares of land along the Tetelpa river. Over the years, the land and sugar refinery passed to Diego de Mendoza, his son-in-law Mateo de Lizama his son-in-law, and Manuel Francisco de Verazategui. The lands of Zacatepec continued to belong to the convent of Santo Domingo de Tlaquiltenango; Manuel Francisco de Verazategui didn&#x27;t pay his taxes in 1722, so the archbishop of Mexico City seized the land and granted power to Pablo de Arizabalo to sell it. The mill was acquired in 1741, by Blas Andreu de Olivan, along with the sugar mill of Santa Rosa Thirty Pesos.

The local civil authority at this time was in the town of Tetala, not Zacatepec; there is further evidence of this in an 1804 lawsuit against Domingo Coloma, owner of the hacienda of San Nicolás (today Galeana) and an alleged land grab. His defense? &quot; [The peasants] earn more than they need… [they are] busy in various activities such as fishing for catfish, trout, &quot;roncal&quot;, and corbina… and [working as] muleteers and couriers.&quot; After all, the peasants were &quot;far from being landless, they have leased them&quot; and &quot;at the moment several pieces are seen of public and notorious that their tenants planted of indigo&quot;. The peasants raised cattle and pigs; they grew corn, sesame, melons, watermelons, bananas, chilies, peanuts, tomatoes, avocados, prickly zapote, lemons, and oranges.

The independence of Mexico put Zacatepec in the State of Mexico until the creation of the State of Morelos in 1869.

On February 5, 1938, President Lázaro Cárdenas inaugurated, in what was once the hull of the old hacienda, the installations of the sugar mill that he had ordered to build, with social purposes, to improve the conditions of the &quot;ejidatarios&quot; and workers of the factory. Within this context was born the decision to elevate the municipality to Zacatepec. Thus, on December 25, 1938, the Governor of Morelos Elpidio Perdomo, promulgated Decree No. 17 whereby:
&quot;Art. 1 .- The free municipality of Zacatepec, Morelos is created, which will be formed with the extension comprising the assistantships of Tetelpa, Galeana (the former hacienda of San Nicolás) and Zacatepec, the latter being the head of the aforementioned municipality and retaining each of them the denomination and limits that they currently have &quot;.

Zacatepec was one of the hardest-hit communities in Morelos state during the September 9, 2017 earthquake; ten people died, 884 homes were damaged; nearly half of which were totally destroyed.

Olivia Ramirez Lamadrid of Panal (New Alliance) was elected Presidente Municipal (mayor) on July 1, 2018.

The state of Morelos reported 505 infections and 59 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico; nine infections were reported in Zacatepec as of May 4. Schools and many businesses were closed from mid March until June 1. The figures went up to 1,238 cases and 238 deaths on May 25; Zacatepec reported 36 cases. The local IMSS hospital mistakenly delivered two corpses to the wrong families on May 12. On June 6, Zacatepec reported 58 infections and 15 deaths from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. Zacatepec reported 181 cases, 128 recuperations, and 4 deaths from the virus as of August 31. David Suayfeta, a doctor at the local IMSS hospital, was burned to death when an explosive device was thrown at his car on November 21. Three hundred thirty-seven cases were reported on December 27, 2020.

Former municipal president Francisco Salinas Sánchez (2015–2018) was arrested on corruption charges on August 5, 2020.

<text>Zacualpan de Amilpas is a town in the Mexican state of Morelos. The town serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality, with which it shares a name. To the north is the municipality of Tetela del Volcán, to the south is the municipality of Temoac, to the east is the State of Puebla, and to the west are the municipalities of Ocuituco and Yecapixtla.

The municipality reported 9,370 inhabitants in the year 2015 census.

The toponym Zacualpan comes from a Nahuatl name: &quot;tzacual-li&quot; (covered thing) and &quot;pan&quot; (on top of); thus, &quot;atop that which is covered&quot;. Amilpas refers to the 25 human settlements controlled by Moctezuma Ilhuicamina from his palace in &quot;Huaxtepec&quot; (Oaxtepec). The term continued to be used during the colonial era.

==Government and political division==
Zacualpan de Amilpas is the municipal seat. It has 3,492 inhabitants and is located above sea level. There are three preschools, three elementary schools (grades 1–6), and one middle school (grades 7–9). It is from Cuernavaca and from Mexico City. Its Sister City is Pharr, Texas.

Tlacotepec is the assistant municipal seat. It is north of Zacualpan. It has 5,087 inhabitants or 60% of the population of the municipality. It is located above sea level. There are three preschools, four elementary schools, two middle schools, one high school (grades 10–12).

Other communities are very small: Barrio de San Juan, Barrio de San Pedro, Barrio de San Nicolás, Colonia Guadalupe Victoria, Colonia San Andrés, Colonia Emiliano Zapata, Colonia Mariano Escobedo, and Colonia Panteón.

==History==

===Pre-Hispanic history===
Researchers point to the Olmecs as the indigenous group who arrived in Zacualpan de Amilpas, considered the first inhabitants in the pre-Classic period between the years 1000 and 900 BCE. The second group to arrive were the Toltecs. Shortly after that, groups of &quot;Chichimecas&quot; and &quot;Chalcas&quot; arrived, founding new communities in Totolapan, Tepoztlán, Tlayacapan, and Zacualpan.

===Conquest and colonialism===
The &quot;Plan de Amilpas&quot; (Amilpas Plain) including Zacualpan was conquered by Captain Gonzalo de Sandoval on March 14, 1521. Francisco de Solis obtained several villages, including Zacualpan de Amilpas, Huazulco, Temoac. He planted orchards, cultivated wheat, and corn, and had beehives. In 1543 New Spain was organized into four provinces: Michoacán, México, Coatzacoalcos, and Las Mixtecas; the present territory of Morelos was part of the Mexico province.

The spiritual conquest of Zacualpan de Amilpas began in 1533 with the arrival of the provincial vicar, Fray Francisco de la Cruz, who ordered Jorge de Ávila and Jerónimo de San Esteban to evangelize the region. In 1535 the two monks began construction of a church and a convent to honor the Immaculate Conception of Mary next to the Amatzinac Canyon. The building was designed by Fray Juan de la Cruz, one of the best architects of the order of the Augustinian order. The church is small and rectangular. an octagonal apse, towering arches, and columns with a square section that supports the roof. The side Chapel of the Rosary dates from the 18th century and is covered by an octagonal dome. The main façade has a semi-circular arch framed by a pair of square pilasters, with molded capital. Above the pilasters is a frieze and cornice molding in Renaissance architecture style. Higher up, there is a small rectangular window and a late 19th-century clock and the west side. The belltower, located in the northwestern corner, is rectangular. On the southwest there are three different-sized semicircular arches forming an open chapel. The monastery and cloister is austere and simple. The central courtyard has walls, arches, buttresses, and cornices of quarry stonework, such as in Jantetelco and Oaxtepec. The atrium was built on a higher level than that of the street, indicating that the complex is located on the pre-Hispanic foundation. The fence is at the level of the atrium, but from the street, it is quite high.

The haciendas of San Nicolás in Zacualpan, Cuentepec, Chicomocelo were established in the 16th century.

In 1646 the province of México became the &quot;Real Audiencia;&quot; Cuautla became an &quot;alcaldia&quot; (mayoralty) belonging to the Intendencia of Puebla. In 1786, José Gálvez, supported by King Carlos II, divided Nueva España into two &quot;comandancias&quot; or zones, besides establishing three governments and twelve &quot;intendencias&quot;.

===19th century===
The municipality originally belonged to the &quot;Intendencia de Puebla&quot;, but when the municipalities of Tlapa and Iguala were exchanged with the State of Mexico, the &quot;Alcaldía Mayor de Cuautla&quot; kept Zacualpan de Amilpas. The municipality was created in 1849 when Zacualpan refused subservience to Cuernavaca. In 1869, upon the creation of the State of Morelos, Zacualpan formed part of the District of Cuautla de Amilpas.

===Revolution and the 20th century===
The Constitution of 1857 was designed to end the abuses of the Church and other large landowners, but it failed. During the Mexican Revolution, many men from Zacualpan joined the &quot;Zapatistas&quot; and supported the Plan de Ayala. Zapata defended education as it was designed by Antonio Díaz Soto y Gama, who ordered the establishment of schools in Tochimilco, Puebla, Jantetelco and Zacualpan de Amilpas. The temple and ex-convent were used as military barracks by federal troops as well as revolutionary ones.

On December 17, 1937, the walls of the ex-convent in Zacualpan de Amilpas and elsewhere were cracked during an earthquake, convincing people that steps were needed to preserve historical monuments. A law was passed on June 9, 1939, that declared colonial convents national monuments and providing for their preservation.

Differences between Zacualpan and surrounding communities led to the establishment of Temoac as a municipality on March 17, 1977.

===21st century===
The (7.1Mw) September 19, 2017 earthquake destroyed most of Zacualpan, which is from Axochiapan, the epicenter. At least 73 people died in Morelos.

Roberto Adrian Cazares Gonzalez of &quot;Por Morelos al Frente&quot; (Morelos First coalition) was elected Presidente Municipal (mayor) on July 1, 2018.

When the federal &quot;Pueblos Magicos&quot; program was canceled in 2019, the state of Morelos established its own program to promote tourism, called &quot;Pueblos Encantados&quot; (&quot;Charmed Towns&quot;). Zacualpan de Amilpas was the first town in Morelos to become a part of this program.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, as of May 10, there were 812 infections and 106 deaths in the state of Morelos but none in Zacualpan. Zacualpan was the only municipality in the state without reported cases. On July 2, Zacualpan reported one infection but no deaths from the virus; the reopening of the state was pushed back until at least June 13. Zacualpan reported 12 cases, ten recuperations, and one death from the virus as of August 31. Twenty-six cases were reported on December 27, 2020.

<text>Stig of the Dump is a children&#x27;s novel by Clive King which was first published in the United Kingdom in 1963. It is regarded as a modern children&#x27;s classic and is often read in schools. It was illustrated by Edward Ardizzone and has been twice adapted for television, in 1981 and in 2002. It was featured in a broadcast as an adaptation on BBC Home Service for schools in November 1964, and later on the BBC series &quot;Blue Peter&quot;.

==Plot==

Barney is a bored young boy staying with his grandparents on the chalk Downs of southern England. One day, he falls over the edge of an old chalk pit close to his grandparents&#x27; house, tumbling through the roof of a den. While exploring the den, Barney encounters its owner, Stig, a caveman with shaggy, black hair and bright black eyes. The chalk pit is disused and full of people&#x27;s dumped rubbish.

Barney and Stig quickly become friends. They learn to communicate with each other without language, as Stig speaks no English. Stig&#x27;s den is a place built out of discarded rubbish, which motivates Barney to help Stig make it look more attractive. They spend time repairing and improving Stig&#x27;s den, collecting firewood, going hunting, and at one point catching some burglars who break into Barney&#x27;s grandparents&#x27; house. On another occasion Barney is cornered by the bullying Snarget brothers, who become uncharacteristically docile when Stig appears and are impressed by Barney&#x27;s friendship with Stig. Although Barney mentions Stig to others, no-one (with the exception of the Snargets) believes that Stig is real.

Barney starts to give thought to where Stig has come from. During a very hot, sultry mid-summer&#x27;s night, when Barney and his sister Lou are unable to sleep, they find themselves transported back in time and out onto the Downs. To their surprise, they meet Stig, back with his own people, engaged in the construction of four gigantic standing stones. They spend a night camping out with the people of Stig&#x27;s tribe, and helping to shift the final stone into position before sunrise. As dawn breaks, the tribe disappear and the stones suddenly become ancient and weathered; but Stig is still there. Stig got transported forward in time with the standing stone which led him to the modern day.

Barney and Lou do not share their adventures with anyone, and their parents never realise the truth of Stig&#x27;s existence, although they jokingly talk about him as a kind of magical being that can fix particularly &quot;odd jobs&quot;. It is left unclear whether Barney sees much more of Stig, or even whether Stig stays in the rapidly-filling rubbish dump. A figure that resembles Stig is sighted working with junk in various locations around the area; but the book concludes that &quot;perhaps it was only a relative of his&quot;, suggesting that Stig may not be the only caveman alive in the modern world.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Stig of the Dump&quot; was adapted for television, firstly by Thames Television for ITV in 1981 and later by the BBC in 2002 starring Thomas Sangster, Robert Tannion, Nick Ryan, Geoffrey Palmer, Phyllida Law, Perdita Weeks, and Michaela Dicker. The BBC series won the BAFTA Children&#x27;s Film &amp; Television Award and its writer, Peter Tabern, received the Best Children&#x27;s Writer award. The series has been released on DVD.

The book has also been adapted for the theatre, to critical acclaim. Topologika Software Ltd has published an adventure game for Microsoft Windows based on the first three chapters of the book.

<text>The eastern rosella (Platycercus eximius) is a parrot native and endemic to south-eastern Australia. It was first introduced to New Zealand in cages, which then both intentionally released and accidentally escaped into the wild and has been found establishing mainly in the North Island (notably in the northern half of the island, Taranaki, Waikato and in the Hutt Valley) and in the hills around Dunedin in the South Island since the early 20th century.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;P.eximius&quot; (Eastern Rosella) is located under the genus &quot;Platycercus&quot; and subgenus &quot;Violania&quot; along with other three species members: &quot;P.venustus&quot; (Northern Rosella), &quot;P.adscitus&quot; (Pale-headed Rosella) and &quot;P.icterotis&quot; (Western Rosella). An early analysis of rosella phylogeny stated that the taxa of eastern rosella and pale-headed rosella are most closely related to each other compared to the other two rosella species. Then, the hybrids of the two taxa have been recorded in northeastern New South Wales and southeastern Queensland, as both species have been recorded habituating in the same ecological area ranges, differ from the other two species However, a mitochondrial study published in 2017 found that the eastern rosella was the earlier offshoot of the lineage that split into the pale-headed and northern rosellas and those non-sister taxa were hence able to hybridize.

The three subspecies of eastern rosella are:
* P. e. eximius, which is mainly found in Victoria and southern New South Wales, Australia. The black feathers on the back have green margins, and its rump is pale green.
* P. e. elecica, which is found in northeast New South Wales and southeast Queensland. For males, the black feathers on the back have golden-yellow margins, but greenish yellow in the female. For both sexes the rump is bluish-green. This subspecies is also called the golden-mantled rosella, often abbreviated to GMR.
* P. e. diemenensis, mostly found in eastern Tasmania. White cheek patches are larger and the red on the head is darker.

==Description==

The length of eastern rosella is . Its cheeks are white, and it has a red colored head. The beak is white, and the irises are brown. Its upper breast is red, and its lower breast is yellow and fades to pale green over the abdomen. The black feathers on the back and shoulders have yellowish and greenish margins which gives the scalloped look that differs between the sexes and subspecies. Moreover, the wings and lateral tail feathers are bluish while the tail is dark green. Meanwhile, their legs are grey. For the females, it is the same with males which is duller in coloration and has an underwing stripe, but is not present in the adult male. The colour of their young is duller than the females and has an underwing stripe.

==Distribution in New Zealand ==

The eastern rosella (&quot;Platycercus eximius&quot;) has become naturalised in New Zealand. Its first introduction occurred around 1910, when a small shipment of eastern rosellas, as well as a few crimson rosellas (&quot;P. elegans&quot;), was prohibited entry into New Zealand by the Customs Department. The shipment was released off Otago Heads by the ship returning to Sydney. There were approximately 12 birds escaped in Dunedin when their cages were damaged in a gale.

By the 1970s, the population of eastern rosella had become well-established throughout Auckland, Northland, and the far north, extending into western Waikato as far south as Kawhia and Te Kuiti, and east to the Coromandel Peninsula. The species also seen in the Wellington-Hutt Valley Region, and also started colonizing the foothills of the Tararua Range, extending east to Eketahuna, and west to Ōtaki by 1985. Sightings also have been reported in the areas like New Plymouth, Taupo, Gisborne, Tiritea, Banks Peninsula, Nelson area, and Stewart Island. In Otago which located in the South Island, the eastern rosella population has remained relatively small, in contrast to North Island populations, which have widely distributed and currently covering most of the Island. On top of that, it has been reported that the meta-population of eastern rosella in New Zealand arose from three main sites of establishment: Dunedin, Auckland, and Wellington.

=== Distribution in Otago ===
Eastern rosellas was well-distributed in Dunedin by the 1930s, and between 1940s and 1950s, they have been sighted to spread across Otago. However, from 1950 to 1970s, the sightings of eastern rosella in Otago decreased, as the population was reported to be in decline The decrease of the population number attributed to the poisoning of rabbits with strychnine and grain, and also due to manmade traps for aviaries. Nevertheless, since 1980s, there has been an increase in the sightings of the species, which reflects a recovery of eastern rosella population in Dunedin.

=== Distribution in Auckland ===
In 1960s, eastern rosellas mainly spread across the mid until the upper of Northland areas. Then, by 1970s this species have been reported to spread around Waikato, followed by Coromandel, the Bay of Plenty and Taranaki. Plus, during 1975-76 the records of eastern rosella in the areas of mid-Coromandel and Waiheke Island suggest that they are most likely spread to the Coromandel Peninsula from Waikato. Plus, during the early colonisation in Taranaki, this species was more commonly seen in Waikato compared to Manawatu, which suggests that the eastern rosella population in Taranaki expanded southward from Auckland, with recent observations that shows a continuous presence in the western North Island.

=== Distribution in Wellington ===
The increase in the population of eastern rosella in Wellington led to further spread into northern Wellington, Manawatu and Waitapa, which was reflected by their establishment and common sightings. However, in Mana Islands and Kapiti, there were no species of eastern rosella that has been sighted.
12/2024: There is a good wild population around the Waikanae area, breeding sites especially near the beach in bush areas.

== Habitat ==
Generally, eastern rosella appears to live in lower strata instead of higher areas. In New Zealand, they occupy along the edges or remnant patches in open woodland and forest areas, surrounding the shelter belts, gumlands, and also in orchards. Plus, eastern rosella also frequently observed in cultivated exotic crops and town areas. They also prefer inhabiting well-maintained lawns such as at the gardens and golf courses. In Wellington, they are regularly spotted in open areas in the cities as well as agricultural lands, which are same favourable areas reported in both New Zealand and Australia.

== Diet and foraging behaviour ==
Being an arboreal bird, the eastern rosella mostly feed on grass seeds, buds, flowers, nectars, fruits, as well as insects and their larvae. Their diet composed wide range of food, and it was outlined that eastern rosella feeds on 50 different plant species as well as 15 species of animals, including a wide range of on-ground food items. As eastern Rosellas forage across variety of food types, they are capable of having numerous of foraging positions or more likely to be an ambidextrous. Across these varied diets, it includes both native and non-native plant species in New Zealand such as eucalypts (&quot;Eucalyptus&quot; spp.), ngaio (&quot;Myoporum laetum&quot;), willow (&quot;Salix&quot; spp.), poplar (&quot;Populus&quot; spp.), and karaka (&quot;Corynocarpus laevigatus&quot;). Nevertheless, foraging on these food resources expose eastern rosella to harmful compounds such as toxins, which are being produced in the plants as their defence mechanisms. Despite having the ability to avoid food which contains high level of toxins, there is still a measurable concentration of toxins in the diet of Eastern Rosella. This appears to be a trade off between meeting their nutritional needs through the plants while encountering those harmful compounds. Eastern rosella consumption of non-food substance like charcoal, or a type of geophagy, often relates to immobilising the toxic compounds such as phenol, while enabling the process the absorption and digestion of protein at the same time.

==Breeding ==

In Australia, eastern rosella usually breeds from August to January–February. As eastern rosella is known as a cavity nester, they often build their nests mainly in the hollows of tree trunks, limbs, fallen logs or tree stumps, gateposts, and nest boxes. Occasionally, they also nest in other locations like wall cavities in buildings as well as rabbit burrows. Female eastern rosella will lay 5 to 6 eggs on average, at intervals of 1 to 3 days. The eggs are usually laid in mid-November and mid-December and soon after they are laid, they will be incubated for about 18 to 22 days, until they reach the fledging period, which happens about 30 to 33 days. The fledging period usually begins in early December and ends in early February. Usually, female eastern rosellas are said to lay two broods, with up to twelve offspring in every season.

=== Breeding success in urban areas ===
In urban areas, eastern rosella were reported to face higher disturbances from other cavity-nesting birds, that leads them to infrequently visit to their nests, for instance, in the form of nest boxes. Less frequent of nests visits are often relates to higher predation rate, thus contributing to higher nest failures and lower breeding success. The rate of nest attendance is also influenced by the diet of the young. Other than predation rates, lower nest visitations could be explained by the ability of eastern rosella to feed on many food items during each visit, before returning to their young and transferring the partially ingested food.

Nevertheless, the presence of additional nesting sites could support the spread of the eastern rosella population and their establishment in urban areas. When provided with additional artificial nesting boxes over multiple period of breeding seasons, eastern rosellas were observed to occupy more of these particular nesting sites. As a result, this could be a way to improve the breeding success of eastern rosella and protect this endangered parrot species in Australia.

== Nesting ==
The characteristic of eastern rosella as a cavity nester contributes to its successful breeding, as they will minimize the amount of energy they spend while building their nest and thermoregulation activity. Cavity-nesting tends to result in a bigger clutch size and less predator threats. Nevertheless, being an introduced species in New Zealand, the establishment of eastern rosella as a cavity nester affects the native cavity-nesting species as the distribution of these types of species depends on the availability of nest sites. Presently, eastern rosella and other widely distributed cavity-nesting species in New Zealand such as common myna (&quot;Acridotheres tristis&quot;) appear to be a threat to native ones, due to expansion and geographical distribution. In Northland of New Zealand, eastern rosella was outlined as the most distributed parrot, which results in a great competition in nest cavities and food resources with kākāriki species. Moreover, from the 1950s to 1960s, the reduction in the number of yellow-crowned parakeet (&quot;Cyanoramphus aurlceps&quot;) that habituated in some forests in the Northlands was said to be the result of the arrival of eastern rosella in that particular area which outcompete the nesting sites and food resources.

When choosing a suitable location to breed, the presence of water sources close to the nesting site is one of the preferences for eastern rosella. Being near the water sources is advantageous for them not only to ease them to get access to water, but also to minimize their energy expenditure and time spent searching for it. In addition, the eastern rosella prefers nesting in areas with presence of other accessible nests, as this increases the probability of finding the right breeding site. The availability of several nests in the same area serves as alternatives, making it easier for them to rebuild a new nest if the old one is damaged or taken over. Additionally, having a few unutilized nests around decreases the chance of the predator locating the right nest. However, poor alternative nesting sites of eastern rosella like burrows, gate posts and tree stumps which are usually located in lower areas, do expose themselves to flooding. This affects the growth of their chicks and sometimes could lead to death.

However, when the nests are too close in proximity from one breeding pair to another, there is a high chance that it leads to agonistic interactions and fights. Hence, rosellas will defend zone around their nests, for example including nearby trees to make sure that no other pairs settled within the particular area. It has been found that dominant female eastern rosellas would destroy the subordinate females&#x27; eggs to avoid them from having a successful breeding.

== Chicks behaviour ==
The nestling period of eastern rosella chicks is quite short, which followed by fledging period after 28 to 30 days, and become fully independent between 45 and 60 days post-hatching. Approaching the last quarter of nestling period, approximately 20 days after hatching, the chicks are able to stand and exhibit well-coordinated perching. By the end of the nestling period, they can walk properly on even surfaces and perform other activities such as climbing, grooming, and flapping their wings. However, their activities are limited and influenced by the surroundings of the nests.

At the beginning of the fledging period, around 29 to 35 days post-hatching, the locomotion of young eastern rosellas develops rapidly. This portrays in the well-performed climbing activity and their ability in turning around from an elevated spot. They also began to practice flying. The development of these activities also have observed for other chicks with different bird species. After improving locomotion, the chicks then further improved to be able to preen their feathers properly, and eventually manage to handle items using their both upper and lower mandibles.

From day 36 onwards, the birds were considered to be independent, and continue to improve their motor skills related to feeding behaviour, for example in handling items with their beaks and feet. They also manage to perform other activities related to body maintenance, excluding bathing. In terms of activity related to feeding behaviour, it is necessary for the chicks to do it perfectly, not only for practice, but also would help them under stress conditions, such as when identifying edible items.

== Spatial dynamics ==
Eastern rosella often rest during the day, and scattering among the trees. They often fly in groups of 10 to 20 birds, among the trees up to three acres. In the afternoon, eastern rosellas will usually transition from resting period to maintenance period, performing activities such as preening and urinating. Then, they often fly to feeding sites to forage in a pair, resulting to noticeable wider spacing among small groups within the larger flock. During feeding, aggression could be seen among eastern rosella as they compete for food. There are also alarms ranging from mild level, where they simply keep only their heads up without moving their bodies, to the high level or increase in alarm which usually results in a fight.

In the evening, eastern rosella would fly to their roosting areas, with the presence of leading alarm. The feeding flocks of eastern rosella then resulting in a bigger number. At night, they then shift from feeding mode to mainly maintenance mode. Plus, calling activity peaks during the night, before they settle down with resting mode. Throughout the night, eastern rosellas exhibit least activity until the morning arrives. As soon as the sun comes out, they fly in small groups and spread among the trees to forage.

<text>This article lists the current and former cathedrals of the main Christian churches in Ireland. Since the main denominations are organised on an all-Ireland basis, this article includes information about both jurisdictions: Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

==Overview==
It is a commonly held perception that the term &#x27;cathedral&#x27; may be applied to any particularly large or grand church. Whilst many cathedrals may be such, this is due to their ecclesiastical status (such a church is grand because it is a cathedral, rather than it being a cathedral because of its grandeur). A cathedral may therefore be a smaller building, particularly where they exist in sparser or poorer communities. Modern cathedrals may lack the grandeur of former times, focussing on the functional aspect of a place of worship, though it should be borne in mind that many of the grand and ancient cathedrals of today were originally built to a much smaller plan, and have been successively extended and rebuilt over the centuries. Some cathedrals were purpose-built as such, whilst others were formerly parochial, or parish churches, subsequently promoted in status due to ecclesiastical requirements such as periodic diocesan reorganisation.

Essentially, a cathedral church is a Christian place of worship that is the chief, or &#x27;mother&#x27; church of an episcopal see and is distinguished as such by being the location for the &quot;cathedra&quot; or bishop&#x27;s seat. Strictly speaking therefore, only those Christian denominations with an Episcopal polity possess cathedrals. However, the label &#x27;cathedral&#x27; remains in common parlance for notable churches which were formerly part of an episcopal denomination, such as may be the case with some Scottish churches which are now within the Presbyterian Church of Scotland (see List of cathedrals in Scotland). In addition, former cathedrals which may now be in a ruined state, retain their nominal status.

The following list comprises, for the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, all locations of a current cathedral church, or former cathedral church, as well as those locations where no trace remains of the structure, indeed where the precise location is no longer known.

Also included are those structures or sites of intended cathedrals as well as pro-cathedrals (churches serving as an interim cathedral), for instance, whilst a permanent cathedral is acquired, or (as a co-cathedral where the diocesan demographics/geography requires the bishop&#x27;s seat to be shared with a building in an alternate location).

The inclusion of the entire island of Ireland is strictly for ecclesiastical reasons. Northern Ireland is represented because, although it politically comprises part of the United Kingdom, ecclesiastically the island comprises a single geographically based unit.

In the list which follows the cathedrals are listed by denomination and (where applicable) denominational hierarchy. Disused establishments are listed separately.

The geographical co-ordinates provided are sourced from details provided by Ordnance Survey Ireland.

Terms not covered in the above preamble include &quot;translated&quot;, which is the move of a bishop&#x27;s seat from one location to another, moving cathedral status from the former church and bestowing it on the destination church, such as may occur in a diocesan or provincial re-organisation.

==Abbreviations and Key==
* + &quot;indicates non-cathedral ecclesiastical use&quot;.
* NM = &quot;National Monument&quot;.

<text>David Clive King (28 April 1924 – 10 July 2018) was an English author best known for his children&#x27;s book &quot;Stig of the Dump&quot; (1963). He served in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve in the last years of the Second World War and then worked for the British Council in a wide range of overseas postings from which he later drew inspiration for some of his novels.

==Life and career==
Clive King was born in Richmond, then in Surrey, on 28 April 1924 and grew up in Ash in Kent. He was educated at the King&#x27;s School, Rochester from 1933 to 1941 and then at Downing College, Cambridge, from 1941 to 1943, graduating with a BA in English. From 1943 to 1946 he served as a sub-lieutenant in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve, which took him to the Arctic, India, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Australia, Malaya (now Malaysia) and Japan, where he saw the then-recent devastation of Hiroshima.

After leaving the Reserve, King began working for the British Council and was posted to Amsterdam as an administrative officer (1948–50). Subsequent postings for the British Council included Belfast, as a staff welfare officer (1950–51); Aleppo, as a lecturer (1951–54); Damascus, as a visiting professor at the university (1954–55); Beirut, as lecturer and director of studies (1960–66); and Madras, as an education officer (1971–73). He also served as a warden for East Sussex County Council from 1955 to 1960. He attended the School of Oriental and African Studies in London from 1966 to 1967, then served as an education adviser for the East Pakistan Education Centre in Dhaka from 1967 to 1971.

Clive King started writing when he was a child. He once stated that his first story was a script for a Western film. He had articles published in both his school and college magazines before his first book, &quot;Hamid of Aleppo&quot;, was published by Macmillan &amp; Co. of New York in 1958. He wrote &quot;The Town that Went South&quot; (1959), &quot;Stig of the Dump&quot; (1963) and &quot;The 22 Letters&quot; (1966) before deciding to become a full-time writer in 1973. He went on to write another 20 novels between 1972 and 2008, but he is probably best known for &quot;Stig of the Dump&quot;, which has twice been adapted for television and continues to be taught in British schools.

As a popular children&#x27;s author King was invited to summer camps for members of the Puffin Book Club Holidays (predecessor to ATE Superweeks), along with other authors such as Ian Serraillier and Joan Aiken.

King was married twice, had three children and lived in Thurlton, Norfolk.

==Influence==
Clive King acknowledged the influence of his itinerant career on his writing: &quot;Each of the things which I have written has been inspired by a particular place which I have visited or lived in. The settings are always as authentic as possible and they determine the action.&quot; This influence is noticeable in the settings of &quot;The Night The Water Came&quot; (relief operations on a tropical island), &quot;Snakes and Snakes&quot; (India) and &quot;The 22 Letters&quot; (the Middle East).

==&quot;Hamid of Aleppo&quot;==

&quot;Hamid of Aleppo&quot; (1958), illustrated by Giovannetti, follows the adventures of a Syrian Golden Hamster. Hamid has no idea what sort of creature he is. The camel tells him he is a desert rat; the tortoise calls him a fat cat without a tail. Hamid is busy digging new tunnels in his home in the side of a hill where he unearths many Things. When Hamid leaves his tunnel home he brings with him many of the Things he has found there. After many travels and encounters with other wayfarers, Hamid digs a tunnel which brings him to the surface in the office of the Director of a Museum, who explains to Hamid that he is a Syrian Golden Hamster and that his Things are relics of antiquity. Hamid the Syrian Golden Hamster donates his Things to the Museum and is rewarded.

==&quot;Stig of the Dump&quot;==
&quot;Stig of the Dump&quot; (1963), illustrated by Edward Ardizzone, follows the adventures of a boy who discovers a Stone-Age cave-dweller living at the bottom of a disused chalk pit in Kent that has been used as an unofficial rubbish dump. The concept does not explicitly involve any of the common fantasy devices such as timeslip or magic. The book has been reprinted many times and has been adapted for television twice.

==&quot;The 22 Letters&quot;==
&quot;The 22 Letters&quot; (1966), illustrated by Richard Kennedy, was the 250th title published by Puffin Books. Set in the eastern Mediterranean world of the 15th century BC, the story follows the adventures of the three sons of a Phoenician master builder through three loosely linked stories in which they travel to the Sinai Peninsula, to the court of King Minos in Crete and to Ugarit. They return and save their city from invasion with the help of the three inventions they have found: celestial navigation, horsemanship and alphabetic writing. In its time &quot;The 22 Letters&quot; was considered, at over 300 pages, to be very long for a children&#x27;s book, although its scholarship and scope were admired.

<doc id="732256" wikidata="Q732890" url="?curid=732256" title="South African springhare">
<text>The South African springhare (Pedetes capensis) () is a medium-sized terrestrial and burrowing rodent. Despite the name, it is not a hare. It is one of two extant species in the genus &quot;Pedetes&quot;, and is native to southern Africa. Formerly, the genus was considered monotypic and the East African springhare (&quot;P. surdaster&quot;) was included in &quot;P. capensis&quot;.

Springhares live throughout semi-arid areas in southern Africa, preferentially in sandy plains and pans with short grasses. In agricultural areas, springhares can be considered a pest due to their destructive feeding on crops. However, they are not currently considered under an impending risk of extinction.

== Etymology and taxonomy ==
The springhare was named in English by William John Burchell in 1822, who derived &quot;springhare&quot; from the Afrikaans name . The generic name &quot;Pedetes&quot; comes from the Greek (Pidités), meaning &quot;leaper or dancer&quot;. The specific name &quot;capensis&quot;, a Latin word meaning &quot;of the Cape&quot;, refers to the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Province, the species&#x27; type locality.

Originally named as &quot;Yerbua capensis&quot; by Johann Reinhold Forster in 1778, using a genus that was applied to kangaroos in the previous year by Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann, the species (at the time considered monotypic, since the East African springhare was not identified until 1902) was renamed to &quot;Dipus cafer&quot; by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788, placing it in the jerboa family. The genus &quot;Pedetes&quot; was created by Caroli Illigeri in 1811, when the species was renamed &quot;Pedetes cafer&quot;; contemporary naturalists would recognize the precedence of the specific name &quot;capensis&quot; and corrected the species to &quot;P. capensis&quot; in the early 19th century.

== Characteristics ==

The springhare resembles a small kangaroo with well-developed hind legs, short front legs, and a long tail which comprises half of its body length. As well as a long tail, springhares have relatively large eyes and ears. Adults can attain in length (including the tail) and weigh an average of . Similar to kangaroos, they are also saltatorial animals who use their tails for balance. Springhares are reported to be able to make hops of and leaps of .

Springhares have long, soft fur, which shortens around the legs, heads, and ears. The colour of this mammal varies from a reddish-brown on its upperparts to an off-white belly and a black tip on the tail. Sometimes the ear tips are also black. Young springhares have finer and fluffier fur and usually have black patches of fur under their hind feet and in a patch of black under their tail base.

Springhares have a different number of toes on their forelegs and hindlegs. Their short forelegs have five digits, each ending in a long, sharp, curved claw, which can be 16 millimetres long. their long hindlegs have four digits, three of which are visibly developed and equipped with a strong triangular nail.

The oldest recorded individual was 88 months (7 years and 4 months) old.

=== Biofluorescence ===
Springhare fur is biofluorescent. Their biofluorescence is patchy, with areas important to grooming and intra-specific interactions being the most biofluorescent. Little is known about its biofluorescence, but both species of springhare are the first thoroughly documented cases of biofluorescence in an Old World eutherian mammal.

=== Regeneration ===
In a study of ear regeneration in mammals, springhares were found to have the capacity for minimal ear tissue regeneration. This regeneration is far behind to that of rabbits.

== Ecology and behaviour ==
Springhares are nocturnal animals, who forage during the night and retreat to a burrow during the day. While sleeping in their burrows, springhares sleep standing, with their head and forelimbs bent down in between their hindlegs, and their tail wrapped around their feet.

These animals are predated upon by a variety of predators, including humans; at least 21 species prey on springhares in the Kalahari.

=== Burrowing ===
Springhares are burrowing animals. They dig their own burrows on well-drained sandy soils, preferentially during the wet season.

Burrows are often located near trees or shrubs, which are sparse in the typical springhare habitat. It is thought they may help with concealment as well as providing a point of reference back to the burrow. A springhare&#x27;s burrow is 20 cm in diameter, may be up to 1 meter deep and up to 7 meters long. Burrows may cover an area of up to 170 m2. They usually have several entrances. Two types of entrances can be distinguished, one which is very visible thanks to the pile of sand present at the opening, and the other one which is a &quot;hidden&quot; entrance with no soil to mark its presence.

Springhares remain close to one of their burrow entrances while feeding and if disturbed, they return to their own burrows, ignoring other burrows in the way. Radio-tracked springhares used burrows in areas covering 0.6 to 28.5 ha.

Springhares tend to only reside in any given burrow for a few consecutive days at most. In a study of their burrowing activities in South Africa, they found that springhares used 4 to 27 different burrows, and most burrows (70%) were only ever used by a single springhare. Very few burrows were used by more than two animals. In the same study, they found cohabitation (two springhares using the same burrow at the same time) to be very rare. The same burrows may be used throughout generations and expanded, with new tunnels added as needed. While springhares have not been seen defending their burrows or territory, they mark the burrows with their perineal glands secretions, or by urinating at the burrow entrance, probably to warn other springhares that a specific burrow is occupied.

Springhares are able to plug entrances to their burrows with soil. Two plug types were distinguished. Temporary plugs formed from the inside of the burrow, probably aimed at avoiding predators entering a burrow. Permanent plugs were long (0.5 – 3 m) and sometimes filled entire tunnel branches.

The springhare&#x27;s unoccupied burrows are sometimes used for hiding during the daytime by a number of other species, including the black-footed cat and the ground pangolin.

=== Feeding and foraging ===
Springhares are herbivorous, eating a variety of plant matter, such as roots, stems, leaves, and seeds. However, springhares are picky eaters and often leave abundant plant materials behind in their feeding grounds. On occasion, springhares may feed on insects such as beetles or locusts, or even carrion.

Springhares feed at night and can range 150 – 400 m away of one of their burrows. They may feed in large groups of up to nine individuals. In these instances, they do not display aggression or territorial behaviours.

=== Reproduction ===
Springhares breed throughout the year and have a gestation period of about 77 days. The females give birth to a single young about three times a year. Moreover, females can be lactating and in the early stages of pregnancy at the same time.

Their ability to reproduce year-round is thought to be attributable to their highly selective diet (choosing only the best parts of the plant), their wide range of foods available to them (above and underground), and their behavioural and physical adaptations to living in arid and semi-arid conditions.

Springhares give birth in a burrow to a furred young of about 250 - 300 g. Springhares usually give birth to a single young, but birthing twins is known to occur. While the young remains at the burrow, the mother stops the usual behaviour of moving burrows every couple of days. She is bound to the burrow where her young is, who depends entirely on her milk. The young stays in the burrow for approximately seven weeks until they attain a body weight of approximately 1.3 kg. The extended period of parental care may help mitigate a birthrate that is, among rodents, remarkably low.

== Traditional human uses ==
San and baTswana people both traditionally make use of springhares. Both groups of people hunt springhares, which can yield up to 1360 g (3 lb.) of meat. Aside from the meat, San people use springhare skins for a variety of uses, such as bags, mats, karosses (garments or blankets made from sewn animal skins) and hats. The tail provides sinew for sewing, and an ornamental belt that produces sounds can be made by tying springhare toes on a string.

<text>Phutthamonthon (, ; also spelled Buddha Monthon; from Sanskrit &quot;Buddha Máṇḍala&quot;, &#x27;Buddha&#x27;s sphere&#x27;) is a Buddhist park in Salaya subdistrict of Phutthamonthon district, Nakhon Pathom province, Thailand. The park is situated just outside the western border of Bangkok. It is highlighted by a high statue of Gautama Buddha by Corrado Feroci.

The park was created in 1957 (the year 2500 in the Thai Buddhist Era) on the basis of an idea of Thailand&#x27;s prime minister, Phibunsongkhram. The park covers an area of about 400 hectares, which in traditional Thai units is 2500 rai. Construction started 29 July 1955, and the park was inaugurated on the Vaisakh Bucha day, 13 May 1957.

After a long pause, construction on the park resumed in 1976. The main Buddha statue was built after that time. Already designed in 1955 by art professor Silpa Bhirasri, the statue was cast in 1981. The Leela Attitude statue, 15.875 m high and at the centre of the park, was given the name &quot;Phra Si Sakkaya Thotsaphonlayan Prathan Phutthamonthon Suthat&quot; (, literally &#x27;the Graceful Statue of the Shakyamuni who was of the Tenfold Power, the Presiding Buddha of the Beautiful Phutthamonthon&#x27;) by King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Around the statue are sites memorialising the four main stations in the life of Buddha: his birth symbolized by seven lotus flowers, his enlightenment under the Bodhi tree, his first sermon, and his death. Another important building is the marble viharn, which contains the entire Buddhist canon engraved in 1418 marble stelas.

<text>Religious segregation is the separation of people according to their religion. The term has been applied to cases of religious-based segregation which occurs as a social phenomenon, as well as segregation which arises from laws, whether they are explicit or implicit.

The similar term religious apartheid has also been used for situations where people are separated based on their religion, including sociological phenomena.

==Bahrain==
==Bosnia and Herzegovina==
Religious segregation has been practiced in Bosnia and Herzegovina since the 12th century. Being historically a multi-ethnic and multi-religious nation, ethnicity and religion are interchangeable within the nation: Croatians are largely Catholic, Bosniaks are largely Muslim, and Serbs are largely Orthodox. These ethnoreligious linkages have influenced political and cultural dynamics, especially during periods of political dominance under foreign dominance where in one group would hold power over the others. Bosniak Muslims held more political influence and power under the Ottoman Empire than any other group, the Catholic Croats held power under the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Serbs held major political influence during the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

Schooling in Bosnia and Herzegovina has been segregated by religion with educational services being provided by religious groups and organizations, this practice finds its roots as far back as the Vidovdan Constitution of 1921. Religious segregation in schooling continued during Communist Yugoslavia with government intervention proving ineffective. Since 1995 with the implementation of the Dayton Agreement, the Bosnian government has agreed and maintained upon a “two schools under one roof policy”, allowing religious schooling to continue as a form of cultural protection. In 2014, Herzegovina-Neretva became the first canton to ban religious schooling.

==India==


The debate over the ban on non-Hindus entering Hindu temples began around 30 years ago when singer Yesudas, who planned to take part in a music program, was stopped at the Guruvayur Temple gate. He finally had to sing &quot;bhajans&quot; outside the temple wall. Though several temples in Kerala have signs saying non-Hindus are barred entry, few of them enforce it as strictly as Guruvayur Temple, which insists on following its distinct traditions. &#x27;Only Orthodox Hindus are allowed’, reads a signboard hanging from the Lion&#x27;s Gate of the Sri Jagannath Temple in Puri. The issue has triggered many a controversy in the past and continues to arouse strong feelings even today.

In the past a number of dignitaries, including former prime minister Indira Gandhi, had not been allowed to enter the 12th century shrine; she was married to a Parsi, Feroze Gandhi. In 2005, Princess Mahachakri Sirindhorn of Thailand was not allowed inside the temple as she is a Buddhist.

In 2006, the shrine did not allow a citizen of Switzerland named Elizabeth Jigler, who had donated 17.8 million Indian rupees to the temple, because she is a Christian. Kashi Vishvanath Varanasi in Varanasi, the temple stands on the western bank of the holy river Ganga, and is one of the 12 Jyotirlingas, the holiest of Shiva temples. The most famous of the many temples in Varanasi is the one dedicated to &quot;Vishveswara&quot;—Shiva as Lord of the Universe. Non-Hindus are not allowed inside the temple, although this is not always enforced. On the northern side of Vishwanath Temple is the Gyan Kupor Well. Non-Hindus are also strictly forbidden entry here.

==Partition of British India==
The partition of India entailed creating two countries - India and Pakistan - on the basis of religion, as demanded by Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the All India Muslim League, though not without significant opposition.

In the colonial Indian province of Sind, the historian Ayesha Jalal describes the actions that the All India Muslim League used in order to undermine the government of Allah Bakhsh Soomro, which stood for a united India:
In the few years before the partition, the Muslim League &quot;monetarily subsidized&quot; mobs that engaged in communal violence against Hindus and Sikhs in the areas of Multan, Rawalpindi, Campbellpur, Jhelum and Sargodha, as well as in the Hazara District. The Muslim League paid assassins money for every Hindu and Sikh they murdered. As such, leaders of the pro-separatist Muslim League, including Muhammad Ali Jinnah, issued no condemnation of the violence against Hindus and Sikhs in the Punjab.
== Iran ==
Shi&#x27;a Islam has been the state religion of Iran since the Iranian Revolution in 1979. While Judaism, Christianity, and Zoroastrianism are officially recognized and legally protected religious minorities, they are not allowed to evangelize or allow Muslim Iranians to convert to other faiths.

Other religious minorities, such as those of the Baháʼí Faith, are not recognized by the government and thus do not have any legal protections nor the constitutional right to practice their religion. The Muslim Network for Baháʼí Rights has reported cases of Baháʼí students being expelled from university due to their religion.
According to the Times Higher Education, Baháʼí educators are required to renounce their faith in order to teach in Iranian universities. Due to its heterodox beliefs, the Baháʼí faith is officially considered a heretical movement because of the Baháʼí belief that Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh is a divinely ordained prophet in contradiction of the Qur&#x27;an, which asserts that Muhammad is the last and final messenger sent to mankind.

==Malaysia==
In 2015, Malaysian human rights activist Shafiqah Othman Hamzah noted that the practice of apartheid policies against different religions in Malaysia is institutionalised and widespread, adding that &quot;What we are living in Malaysia is almost no different from apartheid.&quot;

==Myanmar==
The 2012 Rakhine State riots are a series of ongoing conflicts between Rohingya Muslims and ethnic Rakhine in northern Rakhine State, Myanmar. The riots broke out after weeks of sectarian disputes and they have been condemned by most people on both sides of the conflict.
The immediate cause of the riots is unclear, with many commentators citing the killing of ten Burmese Muslims by ethnic Rakhine after the gang rape and murder of a Rakhine woman as the main cause.

Whole villages have been &quot;decimated&quot;. Over three hundred houses and a number of public buildings have been razed. According to Tun Khin, the President of the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK (BROUK), as of 28 June 650 Rohingyas have been killed, 1,200 are missing, and more than 80,000 have been displaced. According to the Myanmar authorities, the violence, between ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims, left 78 people dead, 87 injured, and thousands of homes destroyed. It also displaced more than 52,000 people.

The government has responded by imposing curfews and by deploying troops in the region. On 10 June 2012, a state of emergency was declared in Rakhine, allowing the military to participate in the administration of the region. The Burmese army and police have been accused of targeting Rohingya Muslims through mass arrests and arbitrary violence. A number of monks&#x27; organisations that played a vital role in Burma&#x27;s struggle for democracy have taken measures to block any humanitarian assistance to the Rohingya community.
In July 2012, the Myanmar Government did not include the Rohingya minority group–-classified as stateless Bengali Muslims from Bangladesh. Myanmar immigration law was amended in 1982 declared 135 indigenous ethnic races of Myanmar without the Rohingya and therefore they are not granted the indigenous rights and only small part of the people can claim Myanmar citizenship per the law.

According to Amnesty International, the Muslim Rohingya people have continued to suffer from human rights violations under the Burmese junta since 1978, and many have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh as a result.

As of 2005, the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) had been assisting with the repatriation of Rohingya from Bangladesh, but allegations of human rights abuses in the refugee camps have threatened this effort.

Despite earlier efforts by the UN, the vast majority of Rohingya refugees have remained in Bangladesh, unable to return because of the regime in Myanmar. Now they face problems in Bangladesh where they do not receive support from the government. In February 2009, many Rohingya refugees were helped by Acehnese sailors in the Strait of Malacca, after 21 days at sea.

Over the years thousands of Rohingya also have fled to Thailand. There are roughly 111,000 refugees housed in nine camps along the Thai-Myanmar border. There have been charges that groups of them have been shipped and towed out to open sea from Thailand, and left there. In February 2009, there was evidence of the Thai army towing a boatload of 190 Rohingya refugees out to sea. A group of refugees rescued by Indonesian authorities also in February 2009 told harrowing stories of being captured and beaten by the Thai military, and then abandoned at open sea. By the end of February, there were reports that of a group of five boats were towed out to open sea, of which four boats sank in a storm, and one washed up on the shore. On 12 February 2009, Thailand&#x27;s prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said there were &quot;some instances&quot; in which Rohingya people were pushed out to sea.
&quot;There are attempts, I think, to let these people drift to other shores. [...] when these practices do occur, it is done on the understanding that there is enough food and water supplied. [...] It&#x27;s not clear whose work it is [...] but if I have the evidence who exactly did this I will bring them to account.&quot;

==Nepal==
On the banks of the Bagmati River in Kathmandu, Nepal is a Pashupatinath Temple dedicated to Pashupatinath. This temple complex which is on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites&#x27;s list since 1979 was erected anew in the 15th century by King kirat Yalamber.

Entry into the inner courtyard is strictly monitored by the temple security, which is selective of who is allowed inside. Only practicing Hindus and Buddhists of Indian and Tibetan descendant are allowed into temple courtyard. Practicing Hindus and Buddhists of other than Nepali, Indian, Tibetan descent are not allowed into the temple complex along with other non Hindu visitors. Others can look at the main temple from adjacent side of the river.

== Northern Ireland ==
In Northern Ireland religious segregation has been a phenomenon which increased in many areas, particularly in the capital city of Belfast and Derry. This trend increased since the Troubles, a protracted series of conflicts and tensions between Roman Catholics and Protestants from the late 1960s to the late 2000s. Segregation does not occur everywhere. State schools are non-denominational, but many Roman Catholics send their children to Roman Catholic Maintained Schools.

In government housing, most people will choose to be housed within their own communities. This form of segregation is most common among lower income people who live in larger towns and cities, and areas where there have been heightened levels of violence.

In 2012 &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; reported: 

==Pakistan==
Today, Pakistan is officially an Islamic country and defines who is and who is not a Muslim. Under these conditions, Ahmadi Muslims are declared non-Muslim by law of the land and cannot claim to be Muslim. They are not permitted to call their mosques as mosques, or meet with people with the Islamic greeting of Peace. Ahmadi Muslims are excluded from government and any other high-profile positions within Pakistan unless they sign a covenant stating themselves to be non-Muslim. There have been cases when the Ahmadi Muslims have been expelled from schools, colleges and universities, for being Ahmadi Muslim. Once the entire population of Rabwah, the Pakistani headquarters of Ahmadi Muslims was charged under Anti-Ahmadiyya laws.

Pakistan also houses some holy sites for Sikhism. Due to security concerns, Muslims are not allowed in the Samadhi of Ranjit Singh at Lahore fort.

==Saudi Arabia==


Prior to 1 March 2004, the official Saudi government website stated that Jews were forbidden from entering the country; however, this practice was not enforced.

In Mecca, only Muslims are allowed, while non-Muslims may not enter or pass through. Attempting to enter Mecca as a non-Muslim can result in penalties such as a fine; being in Mecca as a non-Muslim can result in deportation.

In Medina, non-Muslims are not allowed to enter Nabawi Square, where the Al-Masjid Al-Nabawi is located.

<doc id="732261" wikidata="Q2403605" url="?curid=732261" title="Garth Marenghi's Darkplace">
<text>Garth Marenghi&#x27;s Darkplace is a British horror parody television series created by Richard Ayoade and Matthew Holness for Channel 4. The show focuses on fictional horror author Garth Marenghi (played by Holness) and his publisher Dean Learner (played by Ayoade), characters who originated in the stage show &quot;Garth Marenghi&#x27;s Fright Knight&quot;.

The series is presented as a special release of the fictional television series &quot;Darkplace&quot;. Within the reality of the show, &quot;Darkplace&quot; was produced in the 1980s for Channel 4, but never broadcast anywhere but Peru, eventually becoming a lost series. Saved footage has recently resurfaced, with Marenghi republishing with the intent of gaining interest from a modern audience. The &quot;original footage&quot; of the show is intercut or bookended with commentary from many of the &quot;original&quot; cast, where characters such as Marenghi and Learner reflect on what it was like to make the show. &quot;Darkplace&quot; parodies the fashion, special effects, production gaffes, and music of low-budget &#x27;80s television, as well as the arrogant attitude of certain writers and performers.

&quot;Darkplace&quot; was broadcast in a late-night timeslot, with very little advertising, and met with poor viewing figures. It built up a significant internet following, leading Channel 4 to repeat the series and produce a DVD release. In 2005, Channel 4&#x27;s Film4 asked Holness and Ayoade to write a script for a film version of the series, but the project never saw further development.

The show was later broadcast in the United States on the Sci-Fi Channel and Adult Swim and is available to stream on Peacock.

==Show overview==

The spoof comedy series, released in 2004, lampoons 1980s television drama, particularly horror, sci-fi, and &quot;the rampant egotism of self-appointed &#x27;mastermind&#x27; authors&quot;. The show presents &quot;Garth Marenghi&#x27;s Darkplace&quot; as though it were a real, low-budget television series produced in the 1980s and is now getting its first screening, framed as part of a director&#x27;s commentary series. &quot;Darkplace&quot;″s fictional show-within-a-show includes deliberately poor production and special effects, sub-par acting, choppy editing and storylines that are &quot;severely flawed and open-ended&quot;. This is interspersed with present-day interviews with the cast.

The series&#x27; fictional premise is that some time in the 1980s, bestselling horror author Garth Marenghi and his publisher/publicist, Dean Learner, made their own low-budget television series with a single intent: &quot;to change the evolutionary course of Man over a series of half-hour episodes.&quot; Set in Darkplace Hospital, &quot;over the very gates of Hell&quot;, in Romford, London, &quot;Garth Marenghi&#x27;s Darkplace&quot; shows the adventures of Dr. Rick Dagless, M.D., as he fights the forces of darkness while simultaneously coping with the pressures of &quot;day-to-day admin&quot;. Within this fictional context, Marenghi wrote 63 teleplays from which 50 shows were produced (in the commentary, he mentions that there were 67 episodes at one point, though it may have been intentional by Holness to show discontinuity); however, Channel 4 was eventually forced to reject the show due to its &quot;radicality&quot;, though Marenghi also cites possible government suppression: &quot;MI8, which is actually three levels above MI6, pulled the plug. And they did it because I knew the truth.&quot; In 2004, due to the &quot;worst artistic drought in broadcast history&quot;, Channel 4 decided to air six of the original episodes.

The makers of &quot;Darkplace&quot; endeavoured to make the show seem authentic. From &quot;the retro Channel 4 logo at the start to the distortion of the analogue music track at the start of scenes&quot;, &quot;the fashion, ... the texture of film stock&quot;, &quot;[the] deliberately poor continuity, cheesy lines, wooden acting and cheap special effects&quot;; it is delivered &quot;in such a pitch perfect way you can&#x27;t help but laugh&quot;. Also included are &quot;present-day interviews&quot;, in which Marenghi, Learner, and their co-star Todd Rivers comment on the show-within-the-show. The interview segments further reveal the delusional and self-absorbed attitudes of Marenghi and Learner.

As with promotion for their earlier Perrier Award-winning stage show, the official website speaks of Garth Marenghi, and other characters as though they were real people, while making no mention of the real actors. Press releases also contained &quot;realistic looking fake back stories for Marenghi and the other characters instead of making any mention of what the real cast have appeared in&quot;, and an article by &quot;Garth Marenghi&quot; appeared in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; discussing his &quot;groundbreaking television series&quot;. &quot;More than a few&quot; people and media outlets were caught out by this fictional framing.

The show&#x27;s musical soundtrack, ostensibly composed by &quot;Stig Baasvik&quot; (but with a further credit stating that it is &quot;based on melodies whistled by Garth Marenghi&quot;) parodies the same subjects as the writing, and gained its actual composer, Andrew Hewitt, a BAFTA Nomination as Best New Composer for Film and T.V. (2004).

==Characters==

* Matthew Holness as Garth Marenghi, &quot;author, dream weaver, visionary, plus actor&quot;, who plays Dr Rick Dagless, M.D.: &#x27;Dag&#x27; is a Vietnam and Falklands War veteran and former warlock. His accent is pitched somewhere between Kent and boring. He keeps a Magnum revolver on him at all times. His wife is played by Lydia Fox.
* Richard Ayoade as Dean Learner, Garth&#x27;s publisher, who plays Thornton Reed, a hospital administrator who bears a trademark shotgun and answers to unseen hospital boss &quot;Won Ton&quot;. Learner&#x27;s acting is especially bad even by the standards of the series, which is remarked upon in some of the in-character cast interviews. Ayoade himself stated in an interview in the Scottish Metro that &quot;My acting really is that shit. I&#x27;m not pretending&quot;. The character Reed was in the Korean War, in which he lost a testicle (and a knee) and became a POW.
* Matt Berry as Todd Rivers, an actor who plays Dr Lucien Sanchez: Improbably handsome with the disconcerting habit of losing lip-synch, &quot;impossibly coiffured hair&quot;, and a voice an octave lower than it should be. He generally uses an semi-automatic pistol (with a backup in a leg holster in case his original turns on him). He served with Dag in Vietnam. Most of Todd Rivers&#x27;s lines are looped in, with Matt Berry seemingly providing the most off-sync and over-the-top readings possible. In the DVD commentary, Rivers is seemingly the only actor who realizes how terrible the show was and it was his first time watching it in years.
* Alice Lowe as Madeleine Wool, an actress who plays Dr Liz Asher: a stereotypical fluffy blonde with occasional psychic powers (sometimes exacerbated by heightened emotion). Asher graduated from &quot;Harvard College Yale&quot;, acing all her classes and getting an A. Wool has disappeared since the making of the programme. It is implied through the in-character episode commentaries that Learner had something to do with her disappearance and claims she is probably dead and &quot;buried in the Eastern Bloc – if she got a burial&quot;.

A few other (real) actors have recurring roles in the show-within-the-show: Kim Noble appears in every episode as Jim, a hospital worker whose main function is to listen to Dagless reel off a lengthy speech and respond with a &quot;yes&quot; or other monosyllabic reply, and Noble&#x27;s real comedy partner Stuart Silver appears as &quot;The Extra&quot;: a character whose name is unknown and has been a doctor, receptionist, keyboard soloist and barman. Julian Barratt also appears in three episodes as the hospital&#x27;s vicar, whom Dagless refers to as &quot;Padre&quot;. Graham Linehan and Stephen Merchant appear twice as the hospital porter and chef, respectively. Noel Fielding appears as a mutant &quot;Ape-oid&quot; in Episode 4, &quot;The Apes of Wrath&quot;.

== Episodes ==
This list is ordered by the original air dates on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom.

==Reception==
Rotten Tomatoes gives the series an 87% rating based on reviews from 23 critics, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;The short-lived &quot;Garth Marenghi&#x27;s Darkplace&quot; is strangely brilliant, even while buried under its own layers of satire.&quot;

==Broadcasts==
&quot;Darkplace&quot; originally aired in 2004. Only one series was produced. There is media speculation that the &quot;average&quot; or &quot;poor&quot; viewing figures led Channel 4 to decide against commissioning a second series. Channel 4 started a re-run of the series in October 2006 and released the show on DVD in the same month, while allowing the show to be re-broadcast on Virgin Media&#x27;s On-demand service. In 2005, it was reported that the channel&#x27;s cinema division, Film Four, had asked Holness and Ayoade to write a script for a film version of their programme.

On 27 July 2006, &quot;Darkplace&quot; made its U.S. debut on the Sci-Fi Channel.

The series had a spin-off, the spoof chat show &quot;Man to Man with Dean Learner&quot;, which began on 20 October 2006 on Channel 4. Dean&#x27;s first guest was Garth Marenghi. During the interview with Garth a clip from the supposedly forthcoming movie, &quot;War of the Wasps&quot;, is shown, again featuring Dean Learner and his acting ability. Marenghi would also appear on the final episode of the series, which featured a clip from a video nasty that Garth and Dean had supposedly produced, which featured cameos from various &quot;Darkplace&quot; cast members.

 &quot;Darkplace&quot; is available to watch on All 4 (Channel 4&#x27;s free streaming service) and BritBox, and was screened on UK Gold in January 2016. In the United States it is available on Amazon Prime and Pluto TV.

==Home media==
The complete series was released on DVD (PAL, region 2 only) on 16 October 2006, including the following special features:
* Commentaries on all episodes in which the cast stay in character as Garth, Dean and Todd (Lowe is absent as Madeleine Wool was established in the series as being presumed dead for decades)
* A deleted scene and test footage (both staged deliberately for DVD purposes)
* Original &quot;One Track Lover&quot; single (extended version), along with the &quot;Darkplace&quot; theme and three &quot;Darkplace Moodscapes&quot; by composer Stig Baasvik (in reality the composer is BAFTA award-winning Andrew Hewitt)
* Over an hour of extra talking heads
* Photograph galleries (staged deliberately for DVD purposes)
* Original radio ads
* Original storyboards and storyboard-to-scene comparisons
* An &quot;easter egg&quot; (containing bonus footage) accessible by selecting, and then fast-forwarding, the &quot;Colour Bars&quot; feature in the set-up menu
* An easter egg of the entire television soundtrack; this can be accessed by either clicking on the picture of Liz Asher in the setting menu (this method works only if you are watching the DVD on a PC), or selecting One Track Lover to listen to and pressing &quot;previous&quot;, or by using your DVD player&#x27;s &quot;Go to Title&quot; feature and then entering the title number 19. The soundtrack is approximately thirty-eight minutes, and is divided into twenty-four chapters.

The cover of the DVD also features a play on the DVD logo, which instead reads &quot;DEANVD&quot;.

Holness and Ayoade reprise their roles as Garth and Dean in &quot;Man to Man with Dean Learner&quot;, which is also available on DVD.

Located on the Quai de Conti in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, the institute manages approximately 1,000 foundations, as well as museums and châteaux open for visit. It also awards prizes and subsidies, which amounted to a total of over €27 million per year in 2017. Most of these prizes are awarded by the institute on the recommendation of the .

==History==
The building was originally constructed as the Collège des Quatre-Nations by Cardinal Mazarin, as a school for students from new provinces attached to France under Louis XIV.

<doc id="732267" wikidata="Q351670" url="?curid=732267" title="Komitas">
<text>Soghomon Soghomonian, ordained and commonly known as Komitas (; 22 October 1935), was an Ottoman-Armenian priest, musicologist, composer, arranger, singer, and choirmaster, who is considered the founder of the Armenian national school of music. He is recognized as one of the pioneers of ethnomusicology.

Orphaned at a young age, Komitas was taken to Etchmiadzin, Armenia&#x27;s religious center, where he received education at the Gevorgian Seminary. Following his ordination as vardapet (celibate priest) in 1895, he studied music at the Frederick William University in Berlin. He thereafter &quot;used his Western training to build a national tradition&quot;. He collected and transcribed over 3,000 pieces of Armenian folk music, more than half of which were subsequently lost and only around 1,200 are now extant. Besides Armenian folk songs, he also showed interest in other cultures and in 1903 published the first-ever collection of Kurdish folk songs titled &quot;Kurdish melodies&quot;. His choir presented Armenian music in many European cities, earning the praise of Claude Debussy, among others. Komitas settled in Constantinople in 1910 to escape mistreatment by ultra-conservative clergymen at Etchmiadzin and to introduce Armenian folk music to wider audiences. He was widely embraced by Armenian communities, while Arshag Chobanian called him the &quot;savior of Armenian music&quot;.

During the Armenian genocide—along with hundreds of other Armenian intellectuals—Komitas was arrested and deported to a prison camp in April 1915 by the Ottoman government. He was soon released under unclear circumstances and, having witnessed indiscriminate cruelty and relentless massacres of other Armenians by the Ottoman Turks, Komitas experienced a mental breakdown and developed a severe case of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The widespread hostile environment in Constantinople and reports of mass-scale Armenian death marches and massacres that reached him further worsened his fragile mental state. He was first placed in a Turkish military-operated hospital until 1919 and then transferred to psychiatric hospitals in Paris, where he spent the last years of his life in agony. Komitas is widely seen as a martyr of the genocide and has been depicted as one of the main symbols of the Armenian Genocide in art. Collection of Works of the Composer Komitas Vardapet is included to UNESCO Memory of the World Register.

==Biography==

===Childhood (1869–81)===
Komitas was born Soghomon Soghomonian in Kütahya, Hüdavendigâr (Bursa) Vilayet, Ottoman Empire on 26 September (8 October in New Style) 1869 to Armenian parents Kevork and Takuhi. According to his autobiographical sketches, his parents&#x27; ancestors moved to western Anatolia from the Tsghna village in Nakhichevan&#x27;s Goghtn province at the turn of the century. His family only spoke Turkish due to restrictions by the Ottoman government. Soghomon was their only child. He was baptized three days after his birth. His mother was originally from Bursa and was sixteen at the time of his birth. People who knew her described her as melancholic, while his father was a cheerful person; but both were interested in music. She died in March 1870, just six months after giving birth to him. Her death left deep scars on him, whose earliest poems were devoted to her. Thereafter, according to different sources, either his father&#x27;s sister-in-law or his paternal grandmother, Mariam, looked after him.

In 1880, four years after he finished primary school in Kütahya, Soghomon was sent by his father to Bursa to continue his education. He possibly stayed with his maternal grandparents who lived in the city. He was sent back to Kütahya four months later, following the death of his father who had become an alcoholic. Although Soghomon was adopted by his paternal uncle Harutyun, his &quot;familiar and social structure had collapsed.&quot; A childhood friend described him as &quot;virtually homeless.&quot; He was completely deprived of paternal care and was &quot;placed in circumstances that made him vulnerable to the mental illness he suffered later in life&quot;.

===Etchmiadzin (1881–95)===

His life took a radical turn in the fall of 1881. In September, the twelve-year-old Soghomon was taken to Etchmiadzin by Kevork Vartabed Tertsagyan, the local Armenian bishop, who was asked by the Holy See of Etchmiadzin to find an orphan boy with good singing voice to be enrolled in the prestigious Gevorgian Seminary. On 1 October 1881, Komitas was introduced to Catholicos Gevorg IV, who was disappointed with his lack of knowledge of Armenian, but was so impressed with his singing talent that he often asked Komitas to sing for visitors. After an unfortunate childhood, Komitas found &quot;emotional and intellectual stability&quot; in the seminary.

Between 1881 and 1910, Komitas was mainly based in Etchmiadzin, although he did spend a significant time in Europe. During his first year at the seminary, Komitas learned the Armenian music notation (khaz) system based on ancient neumes developed earlier in the 19th century by Hampartsoum Limondjian and his students. He gradually discovered a great passion for music and started writing down songs sung by Armenian villagers near Etchmiadzin, who affectionately called him &quot;Notaji Vardapet&quot;, meaning &quot;the note-taking priest&quot;.

In the early 1890s, Komitas made his first attempts to write music for the poems of Khachatur Abovian, Hovhannes Hovhannisyan, Avetik Isahakyan (his younger classmate) and others. In 1891, the &quot;Ararat&quot; magazine (the Holy See&#x27;s official newspaper) published his &quot;National Anthem&quot; (Ազգային Օրհներգ, lyrics by seminary student A. Tashjian) for polyphonic choirs. He finished the seminary in 1893, became a music teacher and was appointed the choirmaster of the Etchmiadzin Cathedral, Armenia&#x27;s mother church.

His earliest major influence was Kristapor Kara-Murza, who taught at the seminary only one year, in 1892. Kara-Murza composed and organized performances of European music for schoolchildren throughout Armenian-populated areas for educational purposes. And although Komitas criticized his works as not authentically Armenian, Kara-Murza was the person who taught Komitas the polyphonic choral structure around which he built his musical achievements.

In 1894, Soghomon was ordained hieromonk (կուսակրոն աբեղա) and given the name of the 7th-century poet and musician Catholicos Komitas. In February 1895, he was ordained vardapet (celibate priest) and became thereafter known as Komitas Vardapet. In the same year, his first collection of transcribed folk music, &quot;The Songs of Agn&quot; (Շար Ակնա ժողովրդական երգերի), was completed, which included 25 pieces of love songs, wedding tunes, lullabies and dances. It was disapproved by a reactionary and ultraconservative faction of the Etchmiadzin clergy, who harassed and sarcastically referred to Komitas as &quot;the love-singing priest&quot;. Rumors of alleged sexual misconduct were spread, leading Komitas into experiencing an identity crisis.

===Tiflis and Berlin (1895–1899)===

In October 1895, Komitas left Etchmiadzin for Tiflis to study harmony under composer Makar Yekmalyan, whose polyphonic rendering of Armenian liturgy is the most widely used and who became one of Komitas&#x27;s most influential teachers. At the time, Tiflis was the most suitable option for Komitas as it was both relatively close to the Armenian lands and had a rectory, where he could stay. The six months Komitas spent with Yekmalyan deepened his understanding of European harmonic principles and laid the groundwork for his further education in European conservatories. As Komitas prepared for entrance exams, the wealthy Armenian oil explorer Alexander Mantashev agreed to pay 1,800 rubles for his three-year tuition at the request of Catholicos Mkrtich Khrimian.

Komitas arrived in Berlin in early June 1896 without having been accepted by any university. A group of Armenian friends helped him to find an apartment. He initially took private lessons with Richard Schmidt for a few months. Afterwards, he was accepted into the prestigious Frederick William University. With little left of Mantashev&#x27;s money after paying for rent and supplies, Komitas cut on food, having one or no meal each day. However, this did not distract him from education and he effectively absorbed the erudition of highly accomplished German teachers. Among them were 18th–19th century folk music specialist Heinrich Bellermann, Max Friedlaender, Oskar Fleischer. Fleischer in May 1899 established the Berlin chapter of the International Musical Society (), of which Komitas became an active member. He lectured there on Armenian folk music and suggested that it dated back to pre-Christian, pagan times. His studies at the university ended in July 1899.

===Main period of work (1899–1910)===
Upon his return to Etchmiadzin in September 1899, Komitas resumed teaching and composing. He assembled and trained a large polyphonic choir based on his acquired knowledge. Until 1906, he directed the Gevorgian Seminary choir. It was in this period when he completed &quot;most of the theoretical and research papers that earned him his place among the pioneers of ethnomusicology.&quot; Komitas spent summers in Armenian countryside, developing a unique relationship with villagers. He thus took the scholarly task of transcribing and preserving rural Armenian songs. In the fall of 1903 after three years of collection and transcription, Komitas published a collection of 50 folks songs titled &quot;One Thousand and One Songs&quot; (Հազար ու մի խաղ). Lyricist Manuk Abeghian helped him to compile the folk pieces. The same collection was reprinted in 1904, while in 1905 a further 50 songs were published.

===Constantinople (1910–15)===

&quot;Seeking to bring appreciation of Armenian music to a wider audience&quot;, Komitas moved to Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), the Ottoman imperial capital in 1910. &quot;There he trained a group of students in Armenian melody and formed a choir that toured Armenian communities and gave performances of the folk compositions that Komitas had arranged for four-part choir.&quot; He founded the &quot;Gusan&quot; choir (&quot;Hay gusan&quot; since 1912), made up of tens of musicians. With the aim to produce professional musicians, he taught musicology to Barsegh Kanachyan, Mihran Tumacan, Vagharshak Srvandztian and others.

===Deportation and final years (1915–35)===
On 24 April 1915, the day when the Armenian genocide officially began, he was arrested and put on a train the next day together with 180 other Armenian notables and sent to the city of Çankırı in northern Central Anatolia, at a distance of some . The Turkish nationalist poet Mehmet Emin Yurdakul, the writer Halide Edip and U.S. ambassador Henry Morgenthau intervened with the government, and by special orders from Talat Pasha, Komitas was dispatched back to the capital alongside eight other Armenians who had been deported. Grigoris Balakian&#x27;s &quot;Armenian Golgotha&quot; offers details of his deportation, during which Komitas suffered tremendously and was afflicted with traumatic neurosis. In one passage Balakian recounts how:

In the autumn of 1916, he was taken to a hospital in Constantinople, Hôpital de la paix, and then moved to Paris in 1919, where he died in a psychiatric clinic in Villejuif in 1935. Next year, his ashes were transferred to Yerevan and buried in the Pantheon that was named after him.

==Legacy==

In the 1950s, his manuscripts were also transferred from Paris to Yerevan.

Badarak was first printed in 1933 in Paris and first recorded onto a digital media in 1988 in Yerevan. In collecting and publishing so many folk songs, he saved the cultural heritage of Western Armenia that otherwise would have disappeared because of the genocide. His works have been published in Armenia in a thoroughly annotated edition by Robert Atayan. Lately, nine songs on German poetry, written during his stay in Berlin, have been excavated from the archives in Yerevan and interpreted by soprano Hasmik Papian.

The Yerevan State Musical Conservatory is named after Komitas. There also exists a world-renowned string quartet named after Komitas.

On 6 July 2008, on the occasion of Quebec City&#x27;s 400th anniversary celebration, a bronze bust of Komitas was unveiled near the Quebec National Assembly (provincial legislature, Auteuil street) in recognition of his great input to music in general and to Armenian popular and liturgical music in particular. Previously, a granite and bronze statue of Komitas was erected in Detroit in 1981 in honor of the great composer and as a reminder of the tragedy of the Armenian Genocide.
In September 2008, the CD &quot;Gomidas Songs&quot;, sung by Isabel Bayrakdarian and accompanied by the Chamber Players of the Armenian Philharmonic and pianist Serouj Kradjian, was released on the Nonesuch label. This CD was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Vocal Recording category. A major North American tour by Ms. Bayrakdarian in October 2008 featured the music of Komitas, with concerts in Toronto, San Francisco, Orange County, Los Angeles, Vancouver, Boston and New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall. She was accompanied by the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra conducted by Anne Manson, and pianist Serouj Kradjian. The &quot;Remembrance Tour&quot; was dedicated to victims of all genocides and sponsored by the International Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies (a division of the Zoryan Institute). 

The complete piano works of Komitas are recorded by Şahan Arzruni on Kalan Müzik label in 2010 and remain the definitive interpretation of these compositions. Among the other performers of his music are Evgeny Kissin and Grigory Sokolov.

Since 2018 Komitas appears on the 10000 Armenian dram banknote.

In 2019, the Gurdjief Ensemble debuted in New York City performing Komitas&#x27;s folk songs on traditional instruments.

Modern performers, like Rewşan Çeliker and Pervin Chakar, reinterpret and promote his collected works, ensuring their continued relevance.

<text>The Bank of Queensland (BOQ), formerly known as the Brisbane Permanent Benefit Building and Investment Society (BPBBIS) between 1874–1970, is an Australian retail bank with headquarters in Brisbane, Queensland. The bank is one of the oldest financial institutions in Queensland, having begun as a building society. It now has 111 owner-managed branches throughout Australia, including thirty-six corporate branches and third-party intermediaries. They also have over 2,300 ATMs. The bank also owns Virgin Money Australia and ME Bank.

In 2021, customer satisfaction with BOQ was rated at 82.9% by Roy Morgan. In 2007 customer satisfaction levels were placed at 88%. The bank does not currently have any board directors who are based in Queensland.

==History==
A Bank of Queensland was established in 1863. It collapsed in 1866 closing its doors in the severe financial depression known as the Panic of 1866. Another bank took the same name in 1917 but disappeared into the National Bank in 1922.

The current Bank of Queensland was established in 1874 as The Brisbane Permanent Benefit Building and Investment Society. It was incorporated in 1887. It amalgamated with City and Suburban Building Society in 1921 and with Queensland Deposit Bank a decade later. It remained a savings bank come building society until a trading bank licence was obtained in 1942 in the name of Brisbane Building and Banking Company.

Brisbane Building and Banking Company changed its name to Bank of Queensland (BOQ) on 1 May 1970 and was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange in 1971. Its operations were computerised in 1970.

Bank of Queensland incorporated Bank of Queensland Savings Bank as a wholly owned subsidiary in 1982. In 1991 BOQ acquired Stowe Electronic Switching Pty Ltd and renamed it Queensland Electronic Switching Pty Ltd.

In 1999, Bank of Hawaii bought 5.8 m shares (approx. 10%) in Bank of Queensland. Two years later Bank of Hawaii sold its 6.2 m shares and 5.4 m convertible notes in Bank of Queensland to refocus on its operations in Hawaii.

In 2002, the Bank launched the tagline &quot;bank different&quot; which was to be their branding until 2011.

BOQ acquired the equipment financing business of UFJ Bank in Australia and New Zealand in 2003. The bank also acquired ATM Solutions.

Between 2001 and 2004, BOQ accelerated its branch opening program, opening 55 new branches throughout Queensland and then branches in New South Wales, Victoria, and the Australian Capital Territory in 2004.The following year BOQ acquired the $78 million debtor finance division of Orix Australia. In 2006 the bank acquired Queensland-based Pioneer Permanent Building Society with full integration completed in November 2007.

The bank opened branches in the Northern Territory and Western Australia in 2006 and then merged with Western Australia-based Home Building Society and the Queensland-based Mackay Permanent Building Society in 2007.

In 2010, BOQ joined the rediATM network, and purchased St Andrew&#x27;s Insurance. St Andrew&#x27;s is an Australian manufacturer of consumer credit insurance products. It also acquired the Australian and New Zealand divisions of CIT Group Inc, a supplier of vendor finance to small businesses and middle market companies. In that year, BOQ launched a new slogan &quot;Your own personal bank&quot; which was replaced in 2013.

In 2011, the bank experienced a profit slump due to lending losses from the 2010–11 Queensland floods.

In 2013 BOQ bought Virgin Money Australia for $40 million. Under the deal, BOQ has rights to the Virgin Money name in Australia for four decades while paying royalties to the Virgin Group, and Virgin has a seat on the BOQ board.

BOQ launched a new branding in 2013 – “It’s possible to love a bank&quot;.

BOQ launched a new five-year five pillar strategy focused on growth and digitisation in February 2020. This included reducing some of the 220 banking products it offered and reducing processing times to counter underperformance

In January 2021, BOQ was given approval by the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission to purchase ME Bank for $A1.3 billion raised through an underwritten capital raising of $A1.35 billion. Half of the Bank of Queensland&#x27;s customers are in Queensland with another 30% split across New South Wales and Western Australia. One third of ME Bank&#x27;s with another 47% based in New South Wales and Queensland. Combined, the group will have pro forma total assets over $88 billion, with total deposits of more than $56 billion. The ME brand will be maintained together with BOQ and Virgin Money. The purchase was approved by the Treasurer of Australia in June 2021, with the sale expected to be completed on 1 July 2021.

In October 2021, BOQ sold its St Andrew’s Insurance business to Farmcove Investment Holdings for $23 million.

In August 2024, BOQ announced it would make up to 400 employees redundant and end its franchise model, moving to a corporate-owned branch structure by March 2025.

==Franchise model==
The BOQ chose a franchise model as a key part of its expansion nationally across Australia in the early 2000s. Many of the bank&#x27;s branches are run as franchises, under which the bank pays franchisees commissions on the loans they generate, the deposits they source and other products they retail. BOQ calls the franchisees &quot;Owner Managers&quot;, and selects small business owners who have strong community relationships to set up a local branch in a suburb or town. BOQ&#x27;s stated aim was to offer &quot;communities the security of a national bank combined with local know-how&quot; and a personal banker.

The branch owner is responsible for employing and managing the branch staff and all other operating costs associated with running the business whilst operating according to BOQ&#x27;s policies and procedures. BOQ is responsible for overall brand, policy, product, and operations. Owner Managers were eligible for a series of rewards including BMW car and travel vouchers.

Following the 2011 loss, the BOQ reduced its branch network which included taking control of some of the franchise branches and buying the branch owners out.

BOQ experienced a series of litigation actions between 2014 and 2016 by some franchise owners who believed that they had been unfairly treated.

Two of BOQ&#x27;s Victorian franchisees sued the bank in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 2014, claiming senior bank management forced them out of business. In 2013, the bank terminated the franchise agreement with the owner-managers of its Geelong West branch in Victoria and used police and security guards to prevent them entering their branch.

In 2014, BOQ won a large class action proceeding in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. In this case, the Bank successfully defended claims of misleading and deceptive conduct, unconscionable conduct and negligence brought by eleven franchisees who claimed loss and damage caused by the failure of their franchise branches. In 2015, the NSW Court of Appeal rejected the claimants&#x27; appeal.

During the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry, the banks franchise model was scrutinised.

In February 2020, the CEO stated that as part of a new five year strategy, that owner-manager branches would continue to be an important and growing part of the business.

In August 2024, BOQ announced it would buy all owner-managed branches and convert them to corporate branches by March 2025. CEO Patrick Allaway said &quot;The current operating model and structure is not sustainable for us.&quot;

Notable former franchisees include Simon Black, Mark Bartholomeusz and Ben Tune.

==Involvement with Storm Financial==
In 2010, it was found that one of the Townsville branches of the Bank of Queensland was giving loans to clients of the collapsed Storm Financial. Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission undertook compensation suits on behalf of Storm Financial clients against the BOQ.

==Awards==
BOQ was inducted into the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame in 2014, in recognition of its excellence in providing banking services to Queensland for over a century and its continuing expansion nationally.

<doc id="732302" wikidata="Q55813553" url="?curid=732302" title="Anemonoides nemorosa">
<text>Anemonoides nemorosa (syn. &quot;Anemone nemorosa&quot;), the wood anemone, is an early-spring flowering plant in the buttercup family Ranunculaceae, native to Europe. Other common names include windflower, European thimbleweed, and smell fox, an allusion to the musky smell of the leaves. It is a perennial herbaceous plant growing tall.

==Description==

&quot;Anemonoides nemorosa&quot; is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial plant less than in height. The compound basal leaves are palmate or ternate (divided into three lobes). They grow from underground root-like stems called rhizomes and die back down by mid summer (summer dormant).

The plants start blooming in spring, March to May in the British Isles soon after the foliage emerges from the ground. The flowers are solitary, held above the foliage on short stems, with a whorl of three palmate or palmately-lobed leaflike bracts beneath. The flowers are diameter, with six or seven (and on rare occasions eight to ten) tepals (petal-like segments) with many stamens. In the wild the flowers are usually white but may be pinkish, lilac or blue, and often have a darker tint on the backs of the tepals.

===Similar species===
The yellow wood anemone (&quot;Anemonoides ranunculoides&quot;) is slightly smaller, with yellow flowers and usually without basal leaves.

Wood sorrel &quot;Oxalis acetosella&quot;, which grows in similar shaded places, can be readily distinguished by its 3-parted, clover-like leaves and smaller flowers with only white petals and 5 sepals.

==Distribution and habitat==

The native range of &quot;Anemonoides nemorosa&quot; extends across Europe to western Asia, reaching as far south as the Caucasus Mountains in Turkey. It has been introduced into New Zealand and elsewhere. In North America, there are naturalized populations at well-known sites in Newfoundland, Quebec, and Massachusetts.

&quot;A. nemorosa&quot; is often found in shady woods. The species is common in the British Isles but it spreads very slowly there, by as little as six feet per century, so it is often used as an indicator for ancient woodland.

==Ecology==
The flowers are pollinated by insects, especially hoverflies. The seeds are achenes.

==In cultivation==
Many cultivars have been selected for garden use, The &quot;RHS Plant Finder 2008–2009&quot; lists 70 cultivars sold by nurseries in the UK. Some of the most widely available are:

* &#x27;Alba Plena&#x27; - double white
* &#x27;Allenii&#x27; - large lavender-blue flowers, often with seven petals (named after James Allen, nurseryman)
* &#x27;Bowles&#x27; Purple&#x27; - purple flowers (named after E.A. Bowles, plantsman and garden writer)
* &#x27;Bracteata Pleniflora&#x27; - double, white flowers, with green streaks and a frilly ruff of bracts
* &#x27;Robinsoniana&#x27; - pale lavender-blue flowers (named after William Robinson, plantsman and garden writer)
* &#x27;Royal Blue&#x27; - deep blue flowers with purple backs
* &#x27;Vestal&#x27; - white, anemone-centred flowers
* &#x27;Virescens&#x27; - flowers mutated into small conical clusters of leaves

Those marked are recipients of the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. 

&quot;Anemonoides&quot; × &quot;lipsiensis&quot;, a hybrid between &quot;A. nemorosa&quot; and &quot;A. ranunculoides&quot;, has pale yellow flowers; &quot;A.&quot; × &quot;lipsiensis&quot; &#x27;Pallida&#x27; is the best-known result of this cross. It has also been awarded the AGM.

<doc id="732315" wikidata="Q7433828" url="?curid=732315" title="Scientific wager">
<text>A scientific wager is a wager whose outcome is settled by experiment or observation, following the scientific method. It typically comprises a commitment to pay out when a currently-unknown or uncertain statement is resolved, and either proven or disproved. Some wagers have specific date restrictions for collection, but many are open. Wagers occasionally exert a powerful galvanizing effect on society and the scientific community.

Notable scientists who have made scientific wagers include Stephen Hawking and Richard Feynman. The Stanford Linear Accelerator has an open book containing about 35 wagers in particle physics dating back to 1980; many are still unresolved.

== Notable scientific wagers ==
There are many examples of scientific wagers from the past two centuries, many related to large-scale questions in science at the time. 

In 1870, Alfred Russel Wallace bet a flat-Earth theorist named John Hampden that he could prove the flat Earth hypothesis incorrect. The sum staked was . A test involving a stretch of the Old Bedford River, in Norfolk, was agreed on: Wallace measured the curvature of the canal&#x27;s surface using two markers separated by about and suspended at equal heights above the water&#x27;s surface. Using a telescope mounted 5 km from one of the markers, Wallace established that the nearer one appeared to be the higher of the two. An independent referee agreed that this showed the Earth&#x27;s surface to curve away from the telescope, and so Wallace won his money. However, Hampden never accepted the result and made increasingly unpleasant threats to Wallace. This test is now known as the Bedford Level experiment.

In 1975, cosmologist Stephen Hawking bet fellow cosmologist Kip Thorne a subscription to &quot;Penthouse&quot; for Thorne against four years of &quot;Private Eye&quot; for him that Cygnus X-1 would turn out to not be a black hole. In 1990, Hawking acknowledged that he had lost the bet. Hawking&#x27;s explanation for his position was that if black holes did not actually exist much of his research would be incorrect, but at least he would have the consolation of winning the bet.

In 1975, Michael Sipser wagered an ounce of gold with Leonard Adleman that the P versus NP problem would be solved with a proof that P≠NP by the end of the 20th century. Sipser sent Adleman an American Gold Eagle coin in 2000 because the problem remained (and remains) unsolved.

In 1978, chess International Master David Levy won from four artificial intelligence experts by never losing a match to a chess program in a ten-year span from 1968 to 1978.

In 1980, biologist Paul R. Ehrlich bet economist Julian Lincoln Simon that the price of a portfolio of US$200 () of each of five mineral commodities (copper, chromium, nickel, tin, and tungsten) would rise over the next 10 years. He lost, and paid the amount the total price had declined: . See: Simon–Ehrlich wager

In 1997, Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne made a bet with John Preskill on the ultimate resolution of the apparent contradiction between Hawking radiation resulting in a loss of information, and a requirement of quantum mechanics that information cannot be destroyed. Hawking and Thorne bet that information must be lost in a black hole; Preskill bet that it must not. The formal wager was: &quot;When an initial pure quantum state undergoes gravitational collapse to form a black hole, the final state at the end of black hole evaporation will always be a pure quantum state&quot;. The stake was an encyclopaedia of the winner&#x27;s choice, from which &quot;information can be recovered at will&quot;. Hawking conceded the bet in 2004, giving a baseball encyclopaedia to John Preskill. Thorne has not formally conceded. See: Thorne-Hawking-Preskill bet

In 2000 roughly 40 physicists made a bet about the existence of supersymmetry, to be settled in 2011, but because the Large Hadron Collider was delayed the bet was extended to 2016. As of summer 2016 there had been no signs of superparticles, and the losers delivered &quot;good cognac at a price not less than $100&quot; each to the winners ().

In 2000, Steven Austad and Jay Olshansky bet US$150 () each on whether anyone born before 2001 will reach the age of 150. They later increased the bet to $300 () each. The pot is invested in a fund, and could be worth several hundred million dollars by 2150.

From 2000 to 2003, scientists placed bets on the number of genes in the human genome in a sweepstakes known as GeneSweep organised by Ewan Birney.

In 2005, British climate scientist James Annan laid bets with global warming denialists concerning whether future temperatures will increase. Two Russian solar physicists, Galina Mashnich and Vladimir Bashkirtsev, accepted the wager of US$10,000 () that the average global temperature during 2012–2017 would be lower than during 1998–2003. The bet ended in 2017 with a win to Annan. Mashnich and Bashkirtsev did not honour the bet. Previously, Annan had directly challenged Richard Lindzen. Lindzen had been willing to bet that global temperatures would drop over the next 20 years. Annan says that Lindzen wanted odds of 50–1 against falling temperatures. Lindzen, however, says that he asked for 2–1 odds against a temperature rise of over 0.4 °C. Annan and others state they have challenged other denialists to bets over global warming that were not accepted, including Annan&#x27;s attempt in 2005 to accept a bet that had been offered by Patrick Michaels in 1998 that temperatures would be cooler after ten years. Annan made a bet in 2011 with astrophysicist David Whitehouse that the Met Office temperature would set a new annual record by the end of the year. Annan was declared to have lost on January 13, 2012.

In 2005, &quot;The Guardian&quot; columnist George Monbiot challenged Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute to a £5,000 bet () of global warming versus global cooling.

On July 8, 2009, at a FQXi conference in the Azores, Antony Garrett Lisi made a public bet with Frank Wilczek that superparticles would not be detected by July 8, 2015. On August 16, 2016, after agreeing to a one-year delay to allow for more data collection from the Large Hadron Collider, Frank Wilczek conceded the superparticle bet to Lisi.

In 2012, Stephen Hawking lost to Gordon Kane of the University of Michigan because of the Higgs boson discovery.

Zvi Bern has won many bets connected to quantum gravity. In 2016 David Gross lost a wager about supersymmetry, but he continues to believe in the theory. In 2017, Daniel J. Bernstein made a bet for US$2,048 () with Francisco Rodríguez-Henríquez that quantum computers will publicly break the RSA-2048 factoring challenge no later than 2033. In 2023, John Preuß Mattsson bet $2,050 that the challenge will withstand quantum computing until at least 2050. Daniel J. Bernstein, John Sahhar, Daniel Apon, and Michele Mosca accepted the bet.

In 2021 Alexander Kusenko lost a $10,000 wager to Derek Muller over the possibility of sailing directly downwind faster than the wind as documented on Muller&#x27;s channel, Veritasium.

<doc id="732323" wikidata="Q2067112" url="?curid=732323" title="Del Pezzo surface">
<text>In mathematics, a del Pezzo surface or Fano surface is a two-dimensional Fano variety, in other words a non-singular projective algebraic surface with ample anticanonical divisor class. They are in some sense the opposite of surfaces of general type, whose canonical class is big.

They are named for Pasquale del Pezzo who studied the surfaces with the more restrictive condition that they have a very ample anticanonical divisor class, or in his language the surfaces with a degree &quot;n&quot; embedding in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional projective space , which are the del Pezzo surfaces of degree at least 3.

== Classification ==
A del Pezzo surface is a complete non-singular surface with ample anticanonical bundle. There are some variations of this definition that are sometimes used. Sometimes del Pezzo surfaces are allowed to have singularities. They were originally assumed to be embedded in projective space by the anticanonical embedding, which restricts the degree to be at least 3.

The degree &quot;d&quot; of a del Pezzo surface &quot;X&quot; is by definition the self intersection number (&quot;K&quot;, &quot;K&quot;) of its canonical class &quot;K&quot;.

Any curve on a del Pezzo surface has self intersection number at least −1. The number of curves with self intersection number −1 is finite and depends only on the degree (unless the degree is 8).

A (−1)-curve is a rational curve with self intersection number −1. For &quot;d &gt; 2&quot;, the image of such a curve in projective space under the anti-canonical embedding is a line.

The blowdown of any (−1)-curve on a del Pezzo surface is a del Pezzo surface of degree 1 more. 
The blowup of any point on a del Pezzo surface is a del Pezzo surface of degree 1 less, provided that the point does not lie on a (−1)-curve and the degree is greater than 2. When the degree is 2, we have to add the condition that the point is not fixed by the Geiser involution, associated to the anti-canonical morphism.

Del Pezzo proved that a del Pezzo surface has degree &quot;d&quot; at most 9. Over an algebraically closed field, every del Pezzo surface 
is either a product of two projective lines (with &quot;d&quot;=8), or the blow-up of a projective plane in 9 − &quot;d&quot; points with no three collinear, no six on a conic, and no eight of them on a cubic having a node at one of them. 
Conversely any blowup of the plane in points satisfying these conditions is a del Pezzo surface.

The Picard group of a del Pezzo surface of degree &quot;d&quot; is the odd unimodular lattice I1,9−&quot;d&quot;, except when the surface is a product of 2 lines when the Picard group is the even unimodular lattice II1,1.When it is an odd lattice, the canonical element is (3, 1, 1, 1, ...), and the exceptional curves are represented by permutations of all but the first coordinate of the following vectors:
*(0, −1, 0, 0, ...) the exceptional curves of the blown up points,
*(1, 1, 1, 0, 0, ...) lines through 2 points,
*(2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...) conics through 5 points,
*(3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...) cubics through 7 points with a double point at one of them,
*(4, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) quartics through 8 points with double points at three of them,
*(5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1) quintics through 8 points with double points at all but two of them,
*(6, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2) sextics through 8 points with double points at all except a single point with multiplicity three.

==Examples==
Degree 1: they have 240 (−1)-curves corresponding to the roots of an &quot;E&quot;8 root system. They form an 8-dimensional family. The anticanonical divisor is not very ample. The linear system |−2&quot;K&quot;| defines a degree 2 map from the del Pezzo surface to a quadratic cone in P3, branched over a nonsingular genus 4 curve cut out by a cubic surface.

Degree 2: they have 56 (−1)-curves corresponding to the minuscule vectors of the dual of the &quot;E&quot;7 lattice. They form a 6-dimensional family. The anticanonical divisor is not very ample, and its linear system defines a map from the del Pezzo surface to the projective plane, branched over a quartic plane curve. This map is generically 2 to 1, so this surface is sometimes called a del Pezzo double plane. The 56 lines of the del Pezzo surface map in pairs to the 28 bitangents of a quartic.

Degree 3: these are essentially cubic surfaces in P3; the cubic surface is the image of the anticanonical embedding. They have 27 (−1)-curves corresponding to the minuscule vectors of one coset in the dual of the &quot;E&quot;6 lattice, which map to the 27 lines of the cubic surface. They form a 4-dimensional family.

Degree 4: these are essentially Segre surfaces in P4, given by the intersection of two quadrics. They have 16 (−1)-curves. They form a 2-dimensional family.

Degree 5: they have 10 (−1)-curves corresponding to the minuscule vectors of one coset in the dual of the &quot;A&quot;4 lattice. There is up to isomorphism only one such surface, given by blowing up the projective plane in 4 points with no 3 on a line.

Degree 6: they have 6 (−1)-curves. There is up to isomorphism only one such surface, given by blowing up the projective plane in 3 points not on a line. The root system is &quot;A&quot;2 × &quot;A&quot;1

Degree 7: they have 3 (−1)-curves. There is up to isomorphism only one such surface, given by blowing up the projective plane in 2 distinct points.

Degree 8: they have 2 isomorphism types. One is a Hirzebruch surface given by the blow up of the projective plane at one point, which has 1 (−1)-curves. The other is the product of two projective lines, which is the only del Pezzo surface that cannot be obtained by starting with the projective plane and blowing up points. Its Picard group is the even 2-dimensional unimodular indefinite lattice II1,1, and it contains no (−1)-curves.

Degree 9: The only degree 9 del Pezzo surface is P2. Its anticanonical embedding is the degree 3 Veronese embedding into P9 using the linear system of cubics.

==Weak del Pezzo surfaces==
A weak del Pezzo surface is a complete non-singular surface with anticanonical bundle that is nef and big.

The blowdown of any (−1)-curve on a weak del Pezzo surface is a weak del Pezzo surface of degree 1 more. 
The blowup of any point on a weak del Pezzo surface is a weak del Pezzo surface of degree 1 less, provided that the point does not lie on a −2-curve and the degree is greater than 1.

Any curve on a weak del Pezzo surface has self intersection number at least −2. The number of curves with self intersection number −2 is at most 9−&quot;d&quot;, and the number of curves with self intersection number −1 is finite.

<text>Lunch Money is an elimination-style card game designed by C.E. Wiedman and released in May 1996 by Atlas Games. The game consisted of 110 cards and was sold as a complete box set.

==Gameplay==
The art on the cards consists of dark, somewhat Gothic photographic images of a small girl (photos by Andrew Yates), usually accompanied by humorous quotes pertaining to the card&#x27;s name.

In the game, players control a character with fifteen &quot;health&quot; points, and draw a hand of five cards. The players take turns playing cards to &quot;attack&quot; other players, who try to block, dodge, and counterattack the attacker. When the defender is done responding, he or she takes any applicable damage, and both players then redraw their hands to five cards, passing the turn to the next player. When a player loses all her health points she passes out. The last one &quot;conscious&quot; wins the game.

The game&#x27;s name derives from its theme, that of children involved in a schoolyard fight. There is also a small expansion set called Sticks and Stones, and a larger sequel/expansion called Beer Money.

There are several types of cards, including Basic Attacks, Special Attacks, Weapons, and Defense cards. Each is distinguished by a different background color to the artwork: for example, the images on Defense cards have a blue tint.

&quot;Basic Attack&quot; cards do a set amount of damage (i.e., take away health points) if not countered. Damage ranges from one to seven points depending on the card played. Basic Attacks can be countered by Block or Dodge. If not countered, the targeted player marks off the appropriate number of points, and the turn ends.

&quot;Special Attacks&quot; usually do damage, but have other effects as well. For example, Poke In The Eye does only one point of direct damage, but also renders the target unable to defend against a follow-up attack from the same player who used Poke In The Eye, and either leaves the target defenseless against an attack from the next player to take a turn, or, if the next player is the victim, makes the victim lose a turn. Special Attacks can be countered by playing Block, Dodge, or, in the case of Grab (which does no initial damage, but sets up the victim for other attacks like Headlock and Choke), Freedom.

&quot;Weapons,&quot; like Basic Attacks, do simple damage (always three points) without additional harmful effects to the target, but unlike all other cards, they are not discarded when played. A player can thus use the Hammer, for example, repeatedly over the course of many turns. Weapon attacks may be countered with Block or Dodge. They can also be countered by the otherwise useless Disarm, which forces the attacker to discard the Weapon. Persons playing Disarm are not allowed to capture the weapon for their own use.

&quot;Defense&quot; cards either negate Attacks, allowing the target to avoid taking damage, or repair damage already taken. Dodge may be used against any attack card: Block against any attack other than Grab. Freedom is useful only against Grab attacks, and may also be used to escape from Special Attacks that do ongoing damage, such as Headlock. First Aid &quot;heals&quot; two points of damage when played. Any number of First Aid cards may be played at the same time, either on a player&#x27;s turn, or as a last-ditch defense if a player takes enough damage from an attack that he or she would otherwise be out of the game.

&quot;Humiliation,&quot; the trump card of the game, is usually used as a Defense since it immediately cancels the effect of any single card. However, since it can be played at any time and for any reason (without the player needing to wait for his or her turn), it can also be used offensively to, for example, cancel another player&#x27;s successful Dodge or use of First Aid. Humiliation cannot be countered except with the use of another Humiliation.

According to the game directions, Humiliation, when played, should always be accompanied by a detailed description of what has been done to thoroughly Humiliate the victim. This is an example of the way the game encourages boasting and trash talking as part of the fun.

==Reception==
Andy Butcher reviewed &quot;Lunch Money&quot; for &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine, rating it a 7 out of 10 overall. Butcher comments that &quot;&quot;Lunch Money&quot; succeeds at what it sets out to do, which is to provide a quick, fun-packed combat game that takes virtually no preparation and can be learnt in five minutes. Even if the artwork is a bit weird.&quot;

In 1997, &quot;Lunch Money&quot; jointly won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Card Game of 1996&quot; in a three-way tie with &quot;Legend of the Five Rings: Battle of Beiden Pass&quot; and &quot;Mythos&quot;.

In 1999, &quot;Pyramid&quot; magazine named &quot;Lunch Money&quot; as one of &quot;The Millennium&#x27;s Best Card Games&quot;. Editor Scott Haring said that &quot;what puts it on this list is the twisted sensibility of using arty photographs of innocent young girls in spooky settings, juxtaposed with the cruel whimsy on the card text.&quot;

<text>Sexbierum (; ) is a village in the municipality of Waadhoeke, in the central north of the Netherlands.

Sexbierum is located in the province of Friesland and located about north-east of Harlingen, about north-west of Franeker. The distance to Amsterdam is about .

The village consists of approximately 600 houses, with 1,744 inhabitants in January 2014.

==History==
In history the village is first mentioned in the 13th century as Sixtisberen. The name means &quot;houses of Sixtus&quot; and is a reference to pope Sixtus II. The name can be read in Dutch as sex, beer, rum, and therefore, the place name signs get occasionally stolen.

Sexbierum is a &quot;terp&quot; (artificial living hill) village from the 8th century. It was originally separated from Pietersbierum by a trench of the Wadden Sea. The Dutch Reformed church dates from the 13th century. The Liauckema State was a &quot;stins&quot; from the 13th century which was demolished in 1824, however the gate house was remained. The grist mill De Korenaar was built in 1868 as a replacement of an earlier wind mill which burnt down. It is currently used as a conference and party centre.

Sexbierum was home to 934 people in 1840. There was a station on the North Friesland Railway which opened in 1903 and closed to passengers in May 1935. In the late 1960s, Sexbierum and the adjoining village of Pietersbierum merged into a single urban area, however they remain separate villages.

Up to 2018, the village was part of the Franekeradeel municipality and up to 1984 it was part of the Barradeel municipality.

==Culture==
West Frisian is the main language in Sexbierum, but the Dutch language has an increasing influence. Circa 1972 the primary schools in Sexbierum switched to Dutch as the main teaching language, instead of West Frisian. Before 1972 the only lessons taught in Dutch were the Dutch language lessons.

== Notable people ==
Seventeenth century admiral Tjerk Hiddes de Vries was born in the village.

<doc id="732329" wikidata="Q1926186" url="?curid=732329" title="Mevagissey">
<text>Mevagissey (; ) is a village, fishing port and civil parish in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The village is approximately five miles (8 km) south of St Austell. The parish population at the 2011 census was 2,015, whereas the ward population at the same census was 4,354.

The village nestles in a small valley and faces east to Mevagissey Bay. The inner and outer harbours are busy with a mixture of pleasure vessels and working fishing boats. It has a thriving fishing industry and is the second biggest fishing port in Cornwall.

Mevagissey village centre consists of narrow streets with many places to eat and shops aimed at the tourist trade. The outer areas are built on the steep slopes of the surrounding hillsides and are mostly residential.

==History==
The first recorded mention of Mevagissey dates from 1313 (when it was known as Porthhilly), although there is evidence of settlement dating back to the Bronze Age.

The old name of the parish was Lamorrick, and it was part of the episcopal manor of Tregear. The church was dedicated to Saints Meva and Ida in 1259 by Bishop Bronescombe and in 1329 Sir Otho Bodrugan appropriated it to Glasney College. The Norman church was cruciform and some Norman work remains but the church was more or less rebuilt in the 15th century. In the Commonwealth period the tower became ruinous and the bells were taken down and sold to a Quaker of St Austell. According to tradition there has been a church on the same site since about 500 AD. Meva may well be the same as St Mewan and Issey is also the patron saint of St Issey.

Mevagissey is home to three holy wells. The Brass Well and Lady&#x27;s Well are both situated in the manor of Treleaven, and the third is within the gardens of Mevagissey House, the old vicarage.

Towards the end of the 17th century, Porthhilly merged with the hamlet of Lamoreck (or Lamorrick) to make the new village. It was renamed &quot;Meva hag Ysi&quot;, after two saints; St Mevan/Mewan, a Welsh man and an Irish woman, St Issey or Ida/Ita, (&quot;hag&quot; is the Cornish word for &quot;and&quot;). There is no evidence for why this new name was adopted but it may have been due to the Church replacing a Cornish name with a Christian one. The modern Cornish name is Lannvorek, after the old parish name. At this time the main sources of income for the village were pilchard fishing and smuggling and the village had at least ten inns, of which the Fountain and the Ship still remain.

Andrew Pears, the founder of Pears&#x27; Soap was born in the village in 1768 and set up a barber&#x27;s shop here until he moved to London in 1789.

Cornish wrestling tournaments, for prizes, were held in Mevagissey in the 1800s and 1900s.

==Governance==
The parish lies within the parliamentary constituency of St Austell and Newquay; it had previously been in the Truro and St Austell, &amp; Truro constituencies.

Mevagissey civil parish was formed on 1 April 1983. It fell under the then Borough of Restormel until its abolition in 2009, since when it has been under the Cornwall Council unitary authority.

==Religion==
It is in the Anglican diocese of Truro, the archdeaconry of Cornwall, and the deanery of St Austell.

==Harbour==

The harbour is built on the site of a medieval quay. The first Act of Parliament allowing the new port to be built was passed in 1774. The inner harbour, consisting of the current East and West Quays, was constructed from this time. An outer harbour was added in 1888, but seriously damaged in a blizzard in 1891. The outer walls were rebuilt by 1897. The harbour was given charitable trust status in 1988.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) opened Mevagissey Lifeboat Station in 1869, although the lifeboat was kept at Portmellon until 1888. It was kept afloat in the harbour for a few years but a purpose-built concrete boat house with a slipway was opened in 1897. The neighbouring station at was provided with a motor lifeboat in 1928 which proved capable of covering the area around Mevagissey so the station was closed in 1930. The old boat house was later turned into an aquarium.

Mevagissey lighthouse was built in 1896 to mark the south breakwater that protects the small harbour.

In 1880 there were around sixty fishing-boats engaged in the mackerel fishery, and herring and pilchards were also important fisheries. Pilchards were also imported from Plymouth for curing at the Cornish Sardine Factory and the imported salt was also used for adding to butter at the same factory. Barley, grown nearby, was exported to Campbeltown, Scotland.

There are currently 63 registered fishing vessels in the harbour worked by 69 fishermen. The harbour also offers tourist fishing trips and there is a regular summer passenger ferry to Fowey.

==Mevagissey today==
Each year at the end of June, Mevagissey celebrates Feast Week, a week of family fun, music, and floral dances through the streets. At the end of the week there is a carnival and a fireworks display.

Mevagissey is within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) which along with National Parks, are considered to be the most special landscapes in the country and belong to an international family of protected areas. It is a designation aimed at conserving and enhancing the natural beauty of the area.

===Healthcare===
In May 2019 the sole partner at the Mevagissey GP surgery announced that she was handing back the contract, and villagers faced a trip to St Austell to see a doctor.

===Hitler&#x27;s Walk===
A park in Mevagissey is popularly named &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Walk&quot; by locals. Local folklore attributes this naming to the 1930s use of the park by a local councillor who was perceived to have displayed petty authoritarian tendencies; while others say it was because the home guard would patrol there looking for invasion forces from Germany. The park was the subject of controversy and national news headlines in September 2005 when signs bearing the name were removed after complaints to Restormel Borough Council, and again in January 2015 after the Mevagissey Parish Council decided to reinstate them. Harvey Kurzfield of Kehillat Kernow described the decision to restore the signage as &quot;outrageous and completely unfeeling&quot; and urged Jewish people to boycott the village. In February 2015 it was reported that the council had dropped the plans to reinstate the signs.

===Heligan===
The Heligan estate is located on the steep slopes above Mevagissey, albeit mostly in the adjoining civil parish of St Ewe. The long term home of the Tremayne family, the estate is now best known as the location of the Lost Gardens of Heligan, a recently restored Victorian garden.

==In popular culture==
The writer Susan Cooper based two of her books (&quot;Over Sea, Under Stone&quot; and &quot;Greenwitch&quot;) in her well-known fantasy series &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; in Mevagissey (named &#x27;Trewissick&#x27; in the books), where she used to holiday as a child. Mevagissey House is the vicarage from the first book &#x27;Over Sea Under Stone&#x27;, where Jane first meets the mysterious Mr Hastings.

The Wurzels wrote a song called &quot;Mevagissey&quot;.

In an episode of the 1990s BBC children&#x27;s television series &quot;Maid Marian and Her Merry Men&quot;, the Sheriff of Nottingham (played by Tony Robinson) says that &quot;The country is suffering under the worst cold spell since King Arthur sat on The Magic Icicle of Mevagissey&quot;.

The inaugural episode of the popular BBC Two television cooking series &quot;Two Fat Ladies&quot; was filmed primarily in Mevagissey and the surrounding countryside.

==In film==
Mevagissey is a popular location for filmmakers and advertisers. It featured in &quot;The Next of Kin&quot;, 1942; &quot;Johnny Frenchman&quot;, 1945; &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot;, 1953; &quot;Dracula&quot;, 1979 and &quot;Bad Education&quot;, 2015. Playing Nice in 2025.

<doc id="732330" wikidata="Q4964807" url="?curid=732330" title="Brian Moriarty">
<text>Brian Moriarty (born 1956) is an American video game developer who authored three of the original Infocom interactive fiction titles, &quot;Wishbringer&quot; (1985), &quot;Trinity&quot; (1986), and &quot;Beyond Zork&quot; (1987), as well as &quot;Loom&quot; (1990) for LucasArts.

==Career==
Prior to joining Infocom, Moriarty was a Technical Editor for the Atari 8-bit computer magazine &quot;ANALOG Computing&quot;. He wrote two text adventures for &quot;ANALOG&quot;: &quot;Adventure in the 5th Dimension&quot; (1983) and &quot;Crash Dive!&quot; (1984). He also worked on &quot;Tachyon&quot; (1985), an adaptation of Atari&#x27;s &quot;Quantum&quot; arcade game, which was previewed but never published.

Moriarty joined Lucasfilm Games, later known as LucasArts, in 1988 at the invitation of Noah Falstein. There he designed his first graphic adventure game, &quot;Loom&quot;, published in 1990. Though the game was a commercial success and Moriarty had an idea for sequels which were briefly entertained, he opted to move on to other projects.

After working on an unreleased game based on &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot; for the studio&#x27;s educational division, he took over &quot;The Dig&quot;, a science fiction adventure game based on an idea from Steven Spielberg. The project had a notoriously lengthy and troubled development, with Moriarty leading the second of ultimately three incarnations the game underwent before finally shipping in 1995. When his version of the project collapsed in 1993, Moriarty departed LucasArts and joined Rocket Science Games. Moriarty said of his stint at Rocket Science Games, &quot;It was a silly time. The Rocket Science executives were out to be Hollywood moguls, and, to their credit, they got hold of some serious money, and to start off with, it looked as if it was going to be a really fun gig. And they got most of it right. ... But the &quot;Wired&quot; cover should have warned us. I mean, &quot;Wired&quot; is the kiss of death. If they&#x27;re on top of you, then you should know that you&#x27;re already out of date.&quot;

In 1995 Moriarty became the head of game design for the online gaming service Mpath.

On occasion, Moriarty delivers public lectures. One of these, his 2002 Game Developers Conference presentation &quot;The Secret of Psalm 46,&quot; has been adapted into a dramatic production and a graphic novel, and was included in its entirety as a video Easter egg in Jonathan Blow&#x27;s puzzle game &quot;The Witness&quot; (2016).

Moriarty is a Professor of Practice in the Interactive Media and Game Development program at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

<doc id="732331" wikidata="Q1503011" url="?curid=732331" title="Geoffrey Keynes">
<text>Sir Geoffrey Langdon Keynes ( ; 25 March 1887, Cambridge – 5 July 1982, Cambridge) was a British surgeon and author. He began his career as a physician in World War I, before becoming a doctor at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in London, where he made notable innovations in the fields of blood transfusion and breast cancer surgery. Keynes was also a publishing scholar and bibliographer of English literature and English medical history, focusing primarily on William Blake and William Harvey.

== Early life and education ==
Geoffrey Keynes was born on 25 March 1887 in Cambridge, England. His father was John Neville Keynes, an economics lecturer at the University of Cambridge and his mother was Florence Ada Brown, a successful author and a social reformer. Geoffrey Keynes was the third child, after his older brother, the prominent economist John Maynard Keynes, and his sister Margaret, who married the Nobel Prize–winning physiologist Archibald Hill.

He attended Rugby School, where he became friends with English poet Rupert Brooke. In 1915 he was appointed literary executor for Brooke&#x27;s estate.

He graduated from Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he earned a first-class degree in the Natural Sciences Tripos. He was later made an honorary fellow of Pembroke College. Keynes then qualified for a scholarship to become a surgeon with the Royal College of Surgeons in London.

== Career ==

=== First and Second World Wars ===
Keynes delayed his medical education in order to serve in World War I, where he served as a Lieutenant in the Royal Army Medical Corps and then worked as a consultant surgeon, becoming an expert in blood transfusion. His experience in the First World War led him to publish &quot;Blood Transfusion&quot;, the first book on the subject written by a British author. Keynes also founded the London Blood Transfusion Service with P. L. Oliver. Alexander Bogdanov acquired a copy of this book whilst visiting London to negotiate the Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement in 1922. Bogdanov went on to found the Institute for Haematology and Blood Transfusions in Moscow.

Keynes was deeply affected by the brutality and gore that he witnessed in the field, which may have influenced his dislike for radical surgery later in his career.

Keynes enlisted to be a consulting surgeon to the Royal Air Force at the outbreak of World War II. In 1944 he was promoted to the rank of acting air vice-marshal.

=== Medical career ===
Keynes began working full-time at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in London, where he worked under George Gask and Sir Thomas Dunhill, after returning from World War I. Keynes used his influence as an assistant surgeon to advocate for limited surgery instead of the invasive radical mastectomy. Frustrated with the mortality rate and gruesomeness of the radical mastectomy, Keynes experimented by inserting 50 milligrams of radium in a patient&#x27;s tumour. He later observed that, &quot;The ulcer rapidly healed ... and the whole mass became smaller, softer and less fixed.&quot;

Keynes pursued his new idea through a number of trials, observing the effectiveness of injecting radium chloride into breast cancer tumours compared with the effectiveness of the radical mastectomy. The promising results of these trials led Keynes to be cautiously optimistic, writing in 1927 that the &quot;extension of [an] operation beyond a local removal might sometimes be unnecessary.&quot; Keynes&#x27; outlook was considered a radical break from the medical consensus at the time. Keynes wrote in his autobiography that his work with radium &quot;was regarded with some interest by American surgeons,&quot; but that the concept of a limited mastectomy failed to gain significant traction in the medical community at the time. His doubts regarding the radical mastectomy were vindicated some 50 years later, when innovators like Bernard Fisher and others revisited his data and pursued what became known as a lumpectomy. Limited surgeries, like the lumpectomy, accompanied by radiation are now the standard treatment for breast cancer.

Keynes was also a pioneer in the treatment of myasthenia gravis. Much like with breast cancer, the medical community knew little about how to treat the disease at the time. Keynes pioneered the removal of the thymus gland, which is now the standard treatment for myasthenia gravis.

In 1955 Keynes received a knighthood for services to medicine.

=== Literary work ===
Keynes maintained a passionate interest in English literature all his life and devoted a large amount of his time to literary scholarship and the science of bibliography. He was a leading authority on the literary and artistic work of William Blake. He also produced biographies and bibliographies of English writers such as Sir Thomas Browne, John Evelyn, Siegfried Sassoon, John Donne and Jane Austen.

Keynes held the Sandars Readership in Bibliography at Cambridge University in 1933 speaking on &quot;John Evelyn: a study in bibliography&quot; which was included in &quot;John Evelyn: A Study in Bibliophily with a Bibliography of His Writings.&quot;

He was also a pioneer in the history of science, with studies of John Ray, William Harvey and Robert Hooke. His biography &quot;The Life of William Harvey&quot; was awarded the 1966 James Tait Black Memorial Prize. Keynes also collected books, with a personal library with around four thousand works.

His autobiography &quot;The Gates of Memory&quot; was published in 1981, and he died the following year, aged 95. &quot;The Gates of Memory&quot; includes anecdotes of Keynes&#x27; numerous run-ins and friendships with other famous public figures. For example, Keynes often went climbing with George Mallory, the renowned British mountaineer; he also once performed life-saving treatment on Virginia Woolf after the budding author overdosed on pills.

== Personal life ==
On 12 May 1917 Keynes married Margaret Elizabeth Darwin, the daughter of Sir George Howard Darwin and granddaughter of Charles Darwin. They had one daughter, who died in infancy, and four sons:

* Harriet Frances Keynes (1918–1918)
* Richard Darwin Keynes (1919–2010)
* Quentin George Keynes (1921–2003)
* William Milo Keynes (1924–2009)
* Stephen John Keynes (1927–2017)

Keynes dedicated his life to his work and was also sociable with many friends. He took pride in never having been drunk, and was known by most as an affable, well-mannered man.

== Legacy ==
Keynes&#x27; contributions profoundly influenced the fields of surgery and English literature. He pioneered limited breast cancer surgery accompanied by radiation, a strategy that has endured the test of time. His work on William Blake &quot;was instrumental in establishing Blake as a central figure in the history of English art and literature.&quot;

A library of his scholarly works, notes, and correspondences is held by the University of Cambridge.

<text>The leafy seadragon (&quot;Phycodurus eques&quot;) or Glauert&#x27;s seadragon, is a marine fish. It is the only member of the genus Phycodurus in the family Syngnathidae, which includes seadragons, pipefish, and seahorses.
It is found along the southern and western coasts of Australia. The name is derived from their appearance, with long leaf-like protrusions coming from all over the body. These protrusions are not used for propulsion; they serve only as camouflage. The leafy seadragon propels itself utilising a pair of pectoral fins on the sides of its neck and a dorsal fin on its back closer to the tail end. These small fins are almost completely transparent and difficult to see as they minutely to move the creature sedately through the water, completing the illusion of floating seaweed.

Popularly known as &quot;leafies&quot;, they are the marine emblem of the state of South Australia and a focus for local marine conservation.

== Taxonomy ==
The generic name is derived from the Greek words &quot;phûkos&quot; &quot;seaweed&quot; and &quot;derma&quot; &quot;skin&quot;.

== Description ==
Much like the seahorse, the leafy seadragon&#x27;s name is derived from its resemblance to another creature (in this case, the mythical dragon). While not large, they are slightly larger than most seahorses, growing to about . They feed on plankton and small crustaceans.

The lobes of skin that grow on the leafy seadragon provide camouflage, giving it the appearance of seaweed. It is able to maintain the illusion when swimming, appearing to move through the water like a piece of floating seaweed. It can also change colour to blend in, but this ability depends on the seadragon&#x27;s diet, age, location, and stress level.

The leafy seadragon is related to the pipefish and belongs to the family Syngnathidae, along with the seahorse. It differs from the seahorse in appearance, form of locomotion, and its inability to coil or grasp things with its tail. A related species is the weedy seadragon, which is multicoloured and grows weed-like fins, but is smaller than the leafy seadragon. Another unique feature is the small, circular gill openings covering tufted gills, very unlike the crescent-shaped gill openings and ridged gills of most fish species.

==Habitat and distribution==

The leafy seadragon is found only in southern Australian waters, from Wilson’s Promontory in Victoria at the eastern end of its range, westward to Jurien Bay, north of Perth in Western Australia. Individuals were once thought to have very restricted ranges; but further research has discovered that seadragons actually travel several hundred metres from their habitual locations, returning to the same spot using a strong sense of direction. They are mostly found over sand patches in waters up to deep, around kelp-covered rocks and clumps of sea grass. They are commonly sighted by scuba divers near Adelaide in South Australia, especially at Rapid Bay, Edithburgh, and Victor Harbor.

==Ecology==

Leafy seadragons usually live a solitary lifestyle. When the time comes, males court the females, they then pair up to breed. From the moment they hatch, leafy seadragons are completely independent. By the age of two, they are typically full grown and ready to breed.

The species feeds by sucking up small crustaceans, such as amphipods and mysid shrimp, plankton, and larval fish through its long, pipe-like snout.

===Reproduction===

As with seahorses, the male leafy seadragon cares for the eggs. The female produces up to 250 bright pink eggs, then deposits them onto the male&#x27;s tail with her ovipositor, a long tube. The eggs then attach themselves to a brood patch, which supplies them with oxygen. After 9 weeks, the eggs begin to hatch, depending on water conditions. The eggs turn a ripe purple or orange over this period, after which the male pumps his tail until the young emerge, a process which takes place over 24–48 hours. The male aids the hatching of the eggs by shaking his tail, and rubbing it against seaweed and rocks. Once born, the young seadragon is completely independent, eating small zooplankton until large enough to hunt mysids. Only about 5% of the eggs survive. Each newborn fry begins life with a small, externally-attached yolk-sac. This sac provides them sustenance for their first few days of life. Despite this initial nutrition source, the majority of fry will instinctively learn to hunt and catch prey upon hatching, and will become self-reliant before the sac is gone.

===Movement===

The leafy seadragon uses the fins along the side of its head to allow it to steer and turn. However, its outer skin is fairly rigid, limiting mobility. Individual leafy seadragons have been observed remaining in one location for extended periods of time (up to 68 hours), but will sometimes move for lengthy periods. The tracking of one individual indicated it moved at up to per hour.

==Conservation==

Leafy seadragons are subject to many threats, both natural and man-made. They are caught by collectors, and used in alternative medicine. They are vulnerable when first born, and are slow swimmers, reducing their chance of escaping from a predator. Seadragons are sometimes washed ashore after storms.

The species has become endangered through pollution and industrial runoff, as well as collection for the aquarium trade. In response to these dangers, the species has been totally protected in South Australia since 1987, Victoria since at least 1995, and Western Australia since 1991. Additionally, the species&#x27; listing in the Australian government&#x27;s &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot; means that the welfare of the species has to be considered as a part of any developmental project.

==In captivity==

Due to being protected by law, obtaining seadragons is often an expensive and difficult process as they must be from captive bred stock, and exporters must prove their broodstock were caught before collecting restrictions went into effect, or that they had a license to collect seadragons. Seadragons have a specific level of protection under federal fisheries legislation as well as in most Australian states where they occur. Seadragons are difficult to maintain in aquaria. Success in keeping them has been largely confined to the public aquarium sector, due to funding and knowledge that would not be available to the average enthusiast. Attempts to breed the leafy seadragon in captivity have so far been unsuccessful.
===Australia===

Australian aquaria featuring leafy seadragons include the Sydney Aquarium, the Melbourne Aquarium, and the Aquarium of Western Australia.

===Canada===
Ripley&#x27;s Aquarium of Canada in Toronto displays both leafy and weedy seadragons.

===South East Asia===
S.E.A. Aquarium, located in the Marine Life Park of Singapore, displays both leafy and weedy seadragons.

===United States===

A number of aquaria in the United States have leafy seadragon research programs and/or displays. Among these are the Adventure Aquarium in Camden, New Jersey; Aquarium of the Pacific at Long Beach; Birch Aquarium in San Diego; the Minnesota Zoo; Monterey Bay Aquarium; the Dallas World Aquarium &amp; the Dallas Children&#x27;s Aquarium, Dallas; the New England Aquarium, Boston; the Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium in Tacoma, Washington; the Newport Aquarium in Kentucky, the Shedd Aquarium, Chicago; the California Academy of Sciences; the Tennessee Aquarium; Sea World Orlando, Florida; the Pittsburgh Zoo &amp; PPG Aquarium;, Ripley&#x27;s Aquarium of the Smokies, Gatlinburg, Tennessee;, The Florida Aquarium in Tampa, Florida; the Mote Aquarium in Sarasota, Florida;, and Ripley&#x27;s Aquarium Broadway at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

=== Europe ===
The Lisbon Aquarium (Lisboa Oceanarium) has both leafy sea dragons and weedy sea dragons.

==Cultural references==

The leafy seadragon is the official marine emblem of the state of South Australia. It also features in the logos of the following South Australian associations — the Adelaide University Scuba Club Inc. and the Marine Life Society of South Australia Inc.

A biennial Leafy Sea Dragon Festival is held within the boundaries of the District Council of Yankalilla in South Australia. It is a festival of the environment, arts and culture of the Fleurieu Peninsula, with the theme of celebrating the leafy seadragon. The inaugural festival in 2005 attracted over 7,000 participants including 4000 visitors.

In 2006, an animated short film, &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Gavin, a Leafy Seadragon&quot;, was made on behalf of several South Australian organisations involved in conserving the marine environment, including the Coast Protection Board, the Department of Environment and Heritage and the Marine Discovery Centre. Made through a collaboration of The People&#x27;s Republic of Animation, Waterline Productions and the SA Film Corporation, the film is an introductory guide to marine conservation and the marine bioregions of South Australia suitable for 8–12 year olds, and copies were distributed on DVD to all primary schools in the State. An educator&#x27;s resource kit to accompany the film was released in 2008.

<text>External Short Messaging Entity (ESME) is an external application that connects to a Short Message Service Center (SMSC) to engage in the sending or receiving of SMS messages. The term was coined by Aldiscon.

SME is a term used in many cellular circles to describe a network entity (mobile/cell phone) that can send/receive messages. ESME (pronounced EZ-mee) is essentially one of these but without all the wireless aspects; i.e. it is connected via TCP/IP, X.25 or similar. On SMPP 3.4 protocol specifications ESME refers only to external sources and sinks of short messages as Voice Processing Systems, WAP Proxy Servers or Message Handling computers, and it specifically excludes SMEs which are located within the Mobile Network, i.e., a mobile station (MS).

Typical examples of ESMEs are systems that send automated marketing messages to mobile users and voting systems that process SMS votes (&quot;Pop Idol&quot;, &quot;Big Brother&quot;).

SMSC uses protocols such as SMPP, UCP, OIS, CIMD, SMCI all of which denote the concept of an ESME connecting to an SMSC.
==Relation between SMSC and ESME==
ESME always connects to SMSC using a TCP/IP, X.25, etc. and then binds for the service it needs from SMSC.

For SMPP it can bind for Receiving only service, Transmitting only service or both (Transceiver service). Before SMPP 3.4 it was required to have two different connections, one for Transmitting and the other one for Receiving. Starting with SMPP 3.4 a Transceiver connection is enough for both.

The relation between ESME and SMSC is somehow a master-slave relation because SMSC is providing services to ESME, and usually ESME just uses these services from SMSC. One of the functions of the SMSC is to store and forward the messages while the ESME does not have this function. When a message is sent by an ESME to SMSC towards its destination, this message may stay in a SMSC queue until its destination will become available. During this time the ESME has the options to cancel the message in queue, to replace it or to check its status. ESME can also send a message to multiple destinations which will be handled by SMSC.

ESME are usually termination points of an SMS network while SMSC are the core of it. SMSC can connect between them while ESME only connects to an SMSC. SMPP protocol is designed exactly in this manner for connecting a small end of the SMS network (which is an ESME) to the entire SMS network (which is done through the SMSC)

ESME is submitting MTs to SMSC, while SMSC is delivering MOs to ESME.

==Routing in SMSC for ESME==
An example of how the routing can be done at SMSC level, but not mandatory as this depends a lot on the implementation of SMSC and the way the connection inside the SMSC is between routing part of the SMSC and SMPP interface can be as below:
During the service agreement between ESME and service provider (SMSC side) one unique short code will be allocated to ESME. At the SMSC end smpp server will have list of all ESME address and active connection. When any message gets sent to short code, messages first comes to SMSC, SMSC decodes it according to GSM 3.4 spec, then one of the modules in SMSC checks the destination address and if it is short code then that module routes messages to SMPP server part of the SMSC. Now SMPP server will have all active connection, according to destination address it selects the ESME - SMPP server connection object, that object will be responsible to encode message according to SMPP protocol and forward to ESME.

Communication between SMSC and ESME can be on either SMPP or HTTP.
If one has a SMPP account, they could connect to the SMPP IP+Port on TCP/IP and the SMPP will push MOs to ESME on SMPP connection, and ESME will push MTs on the same connection in reverse.
If they have a HTTP account with the operator&#x27;s SMSC, then the SMSC will submit MO to a given URL and to push MTs SMSC will be given on URL.

<text>Neuroticfish is a German musical project whose styles are borrowed from electronic body music, futurepop, and synthpop, as well as other types of electronic music. It has released music on the Dancing Ferret Discs record label.

==History==
Neuroticfish&#x27;s sole member is Sascha Mario Klein. Klein cites his musical inspirations as such bands as Skinny Puppy, Nine Inch Nails, The Cure, and Depeche Mode, and began experimenting with music on his own in the early 90s. After starting Neuroticfish, Klein did not make the typical efforts of a musician to send out a demo; instead, he relied on the internet to release and promote his music. Klein was eventually offered a place on a synthpop sampler called A Reflexion of Synthpop, which allowed the project to gain popularity within the club scene.

The project gained some notoriety for two songs—&quot;Black Again&quot; and &quot;Prostitute&quot;—containing the sample &quot;Electronic body music is dead&quot;, which Neuroticfish adopted as a catchphrase. The single &quot;The Bomb&quot; contains advertisement for the band&#x27;s website, www.ebmisdead.com.

In 2002, two singles charted on the Deutsche Alternative Charts: &quot;Prostitute&quot; at number 3 for 8 weeks and &quot;WakeMeUp!&quot; at number 4, also for 8 weeks.

On 4 January 2008, the official Neuroticfish MySpace page announced that the band would cease to exist after its performance at the 2008 Wave-Gotik-Treffen festival in Leipzig, Germany. On 12 May, the official web site for the project stated that the musical project had been &quot;closed&quot;.

On the 20th of July 2012 an official Facebook page and Homepage resurfaced, stating that Neuroticfish are back and working on a new album.

On March 13, 2013, a new Song (“Former Me”) was released on Soundcloud.

On July 4, 2013, the band revealed a new track off the upcoming album (“Illusion of Home”) on Soundcloud, which received more than 1000 plays in the first 24 hours of being uploaded. In an interview with South African music news website Downtuned.co.za a few days later, the band confirmed that the album title would be “A Sign of Life”, and that the band was aiming for release later in the year. Although it would be delayed, the album saw release on March 27, 2015.

<text>Dismantled (born Gary Zon) is an electronic music artist from the United States.

==History==

Dismantled is the product of an experiment that began in late 2000 by Gary Zon, who was attempting to create something similar to Front Line Assembly&#x27;s sound. After overwhelming positive feedback from online listeners, Gary began further sonic construction by drawing influences from television, movies, and music as well as adding vocals into the mix. The resulting sound was a unique blend of very melodic, yet complex mix of layered electro-industrial merged with intelligent dance music elements. This dark, brooding, futuristic ensemble yielded more and more positive feedback, while comparing it to Front Line Assembly, Haujobb, Wumpscut and Velvet Acid Christ.

Dismantled&#x27;s first and only demo release came in March 2001 through mp3.com. Demo Variation was sent to labels and radio stations. After four months of waiting, the demo caught the attention of dependent, who released the track &quot;Purity&quot; on their Septic II compilation alongside of such bands as Apoptygma Berzerk, Front Line Assembly, and VNV Nation. In late October 2001, Metropolis Records contacted Zon and expressed interest in working with Dismantled.

In 2002, another Dismantled song, &quot;Survivor,&quot; landed a place on the Dystopian Visions Resist the Command 2 compilation, and Dismantled won a re-mix contest for Wumpscut&#x27;s &quot;Wreath of Barbs.&quot; The self-titled debut of Dismantled was released June 4 on Metropolis Records for North America and dependent for Europe. Several media publications named Dismantled the electronic newcomer of the year for 2002.

Dismantled&#x27;s 2004 second release, &quot;Post Nuclear&quot;, set a new standard for aggro-electro. Gary also added supporting members to the live line-up; &quot;Loud&quot; Chris DeMarcus on keys/percussion, Adrian White on Drums, Jimie Kurczodyna on bass/keyboards, and Dale on bass/keyboards. Not only were there aggressive and edgy songs, but also tracks with a softer side that help to offset the release. Atmospheric layers drenched in crunchy synths, distorted beats, growling vocals, clean melodies, and cleverly hidden samples highlighted the different aspects of Post Nuclear.

After the success of the critically acclaimed album, &quot;Post Nuclear&quot;, Dismantled remained busy in the studio preparing their next album, &quot;Standard Issue&quot;, which was released in 2006. As a preview of the album, Dismantled presented the Breed To Death EP. Described by Gary Zon himself as having a &quot;predictable, club-oriented sound that is a reaction to the social grid surrounding me at the present time,&quot; Breed to Death is designed for the clubs. A fusion of 80&#x27;s, electro-clash, and trance alongside traditional electro elements and harsh synthetics, the title track was meant to exaggerate and stereotype the new wave of electro, as well as balance the edge and complexity inherent in Dismantled&#x27;s music. It was supporting &quot;Standard Issue&quot; that brought the band to Europe to perform for 2007&#x27;s Wave-Gotik-Treffen. There Zon was supported by Brian DiDomenico on keyboards and Jon Siren on drums, both of Mankind Is Obsolete

More recently, Gary Zon is also involved in two side projects. One is Aerodrone, an electroclash band signed to Warner/Cordless Records. The other, which includes female vocalist TZA, is called no.not.never. No.not.never&#x27;s sound is that of melodic futurepop and alternative rock.

Dismantled has since participated in tours supporting Combichrist in the US in 2009 and in Europe in 2010 featuring the lineup of TZA on keyboards and Jon Siren on drums with an appearance at GothicFest in the Netherlands supporting Skinny Puppy revealing some new tracks for the upcoming album. On June 14, 2011, Zon is slated to release &quot;The War Inside Me&quot; on Metropolis Records.

<text>James Hinks (7 January 1829 – 10 October 1878) was a dog breeder who bred and named the English Bull Terrier in the 1860s, as well as the English White Terrier. He lived most of his life in Birmingham and died there in 1878.

==Biography==
Hinks was born in 1829 in the town of Mullingar in Ireland, his father being a shoemaker from Birmingham in England named John Hinks. They returned to Birmingham shortly after James&#x27; birth. The elder James worked in the industrial sector, where Hinks Jr. began to work in the forges. This same year he married Elizabeth Moore and they had three children, the eldest, James II, a girl named Mary and the youngest, Frederick. Already by 1854 Hinks began to trade with poultry, which gave him a better status and as a hobby had the breeding of ornamental birds, wild mice. With his bulldog &quot;Old Madman&quot; he started raising dogs, and his social position and comforts for his family improved. In 1858 a fourth son was born, Alfred, and in 1864 the family already had eight children in total, it was not until the sixties that Hinks appeared registered in the address book as a breeder of birds and dogs. Hinks died at the young age of 47, affected by a deadly tuburculosis, and his inheritance according to his testament was at the hands of his wife Elizabeth.

==Bull terrier==
Although very little is known about the crossings that Hinks carried out to obtain the Bull Terriers, it is documented by Henry Walsh, that perhaps Hinks used the old English Bulldog, English White Terrier, the Dalmatian and perhaps even the Greyhound. Without a doubt it was his dog Old Madman, who being raised for exhibitions and not for fights played a determining role in the birth of the new race. As part of the folklore of the race, it is said that the dog of Hinks, called &quot;Puss&quot;, after an exhibition or during it, fought against a bitch bull and terrier owned by Mr. Tupper and after half an hour, Puss returned triumphantly with small marks on his snout.
Between 1855 and 1868 Hinks was the owner of at least the following dogs: Bull Terrier &quot;Spring&quot; (Jerry x Daisy), &quot;Bulldog Nettle&quot; (Grip x Nettle), Bull Terrier, &quot;Young Puss&quot; (Old Madman x Old Puss), the Terrier, &quot;Lady&quot; (Stormer x Daisy), Bull Terrier, &quot;Kit&quot; (unknown pedigree), Dalmatian, &quot;Spot&quot; (Joss x Dinah) and a Greyhound called &quot;Dart&quot; (Chap x Fly). Hinks even was the owner of all the parents of these dogs and not only Hinks contributed to the development of the Bull Terrier breed, but all those people who bought their white puppies, and it was not until after 1900 that he had a colored Bull

The legacy of Hinks is known worldwide, and his sons James II and Frederick, continued the work of his father including the son of James II, Carleton, was a breeder of the breed until his death in 1977. This being the way to honor the passionate work of his grandfather and his love for exhibition, breeding and their dogs.

<text>Henri Michaux (; 24 May 1899, Namur – 19 October 1984, Paris) was a Belgian-born French poet, writer and painter. Michaux is renowned for his strange, highly original poetry and prose, and also for his art: the Paris Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum in New York had major shows of his work in 1978 (see below, Visual Arts). His autobiographical texts that chronicle his psychedelic experiments with LSD and mescaline include &quot;Miserable Miracle&quot; and &quot;The Major Ordeals of the Mind and the Countless Minor Ones&quot;. He is recognised for his idiosyncratic travelogues and books of art criticism. Michaux is also known for his stories about Plume – &quot;a peaceable man&quot; – perhaps the most unenterprising hero in the history of literature, a character subject to many misfortunes. 

His poetic works have often been republished in France, where they are studied along with major poets of French literature. In 1955 he became a citizen of France, and he lived the rest of his life there. He became a friend of Romanian pessimist philosopher Emil Cioran around the same time, along with other literary luminaries in France. In 1965 he won the grand prix national des Lettres, which he refused to accept, as he did every honor he was accorded in his life.

==Biography==
===Travels===
In 1930 and 1931, Michaux visited Japan, China and India. The result of this trip was the book &quot;A Barbarian in Asia&quot;. Asian culture became one of his biggest influences. The philosophy of Buddhism and calligraphy later became principal subjects of many of his poems and inspired many of his drawings. He also visited Ecuador and published a travelogue book of the same name. His travels across the Americas finished in Brazil in 1939, and he stayed there for two years.

===Visual arts===
Michaux was a highly original visual artist, associated with the Tachiste movement in the 1940s and 50s, although that describes only a small part of his artistic achievement--for example, his hallucinatory representations of faces and heads. His work often makes use of dense, suggestively gestural strokes that incorporate elements of calligraphy, asemic writing, and abstract expressionism. The Museum of Modern Art in Paris and the Guggenheim Museum in New York both had major shows of his work in 1978.

== Adaptations ==
Japanese animator Ryo Orikasa adapted Michaux&#x27;s poetry for the 2023 short film &quot;Miserable Miracle&quot;, winner of the top animated short prize at the Ottawa International Animation Festival.

<text>The San Francisco volcanic field is an area of volcanoes in northern Arizona, north of Flagstaff, US. The field covers 1,800 square miles (4,700 km2) of the southern boundary of the Colorado Plateau. The field contains 600 volcanoes ranging in age from nearly 6 million years old to less than 1,000 years (Miocene to Holocene), of which Sunset Crater is the youngest. The highest peak in the field is Humphreys Peak, at Flagstaff&#x27;s northern perimeter: the peak is Arizona&#x27;s highest at 12,633 feet (3,851.5 m) and is a part of the San Francisco Peaks, an active stratovolcano complex.

==Description==
This volcanic field seems to have formed from a geological hotspot. As the North American Plate moves over the spot, new volcanoes appear. Thus, the newest volcanoes are at the east side of the field. Most of the volcanoes are basalt cinder cones, but there are also large lava domes consisting of rhyolite and dacite.

Given that Sunset Crater is such a young volcanic feature of this area and that eruptions have occurred every several thousands of years in frequency, it is likely that there will be a future eruption in the San Francisco Volcanic field. However, it is impossible to predict when and exactly where a new eruption might occur. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) says that a future eruption would likely be in the eastern side of the volcanic field, where the most recent volcanic activity has occurred. Such an eruption is likely to be small and pose little hazard due to the remoteness of the area.

==Visitation and usage==

Popular tourist and hiking destinations in the volcanic field include the Kendrick Mountain Wilderness, 20 miles northwest of Flagstaff; and Sunset Crater. Sunset crater has a hiking trail along an ʻaʻā lava flow to its base.

Areas of the volcanic field have been used by NASA for testing techniques for exploration in a simulated extraterrestrial terrain environment. NASA has also conducted the Desert Research and Technology Studies (DRATS) tests here.

<doc id="732358" wikidata="Q380000" url="?curid=732358" title="Yury Olesha">
<text>Yury Karlovich Olesha (, – 10 May 1960) was a Russian and Soviet novelist. He is considered one of the greatest Russian novelists of the 20th century, one of the few to have succeeded in writing works of lasting artistic value despite the stifling censorship of the era. His works are delicate balancing acts that superficially send pro-Communist messages but reveal far greater subtlety and richness upon a deeper reading. Sometimes, he is grouped with his friends Ilf and Petrov, Isaac Babel, and Sigismund Krzhizhanovsky into the Odessa School of Writers.

==Biography==
Yuri Olesha was born on to Catholic parents of Polish descent in Elizavetgrad (now Kropyvnytskyi, Ukraine). Olesha&#x27;s father, Karl Antonovich, was an impoverished landowner who later became a government inspector of alcohol and developed a proclivity for drinking and gambling. In 1902 Olesha and his family settled in Odessa, where Yuri would eventually meet many of his fellow writers such as Isaac Babel, Ilya Ilf, and Valentin Kataev, and ultimately maintain a lifelong friendship with the latter. As a student, Yuri demonstrated a knack for science but favored literature above his other subjects and began writing during the year before his graduation cum laude from high school. In 1917 Olesha entered law school but postponed his studies two years later to volunteer for the Red Army during the Civil War; during this time, Olesha began producing propaganda for the revolution.

Olesha&#x27;s writing career began while he was involved with the literary group of young writers in Odessa called &quot;The Green Lamp,&quot; which included not only Kataev and Olesha, but such influential writers as Eduard Bagritski and Dmitry Merezhkovsky. He also formed a close friendship with Isaac Babel. Olesha continued to produce propaganda materials for the revolution in Odessa and then in Kharkov, where he relocated in 1921. In 1922, Olesha published his first short story, &quot;Angel,&quot; and moved to Moscow the same year to work at a popular railway worker&#x27;s periodical called &quot;The Whistle&quot;. Here Olesha began writing featured satirical poetry under the pseudonym &quot;Зубило&quot; (&quot;The Chisel&quot;), eventually publishing two collections of poems in 1924 and 1927 before turning to prose writing and drama.

Olesha&#x27;s literary debut would also become one of his most popular works: the novel &quot;Envy&quot;, which he published in 1927, follows five leading characters. Largely regarded as his greatest work, the novel thematically contrasts the old and new order, as well as individualism and collectivism, in Soviet Russia. During this period Olesha published another popular success: the fairy tale &quot;The Three Fat Men&quot; which he wrote in 1924 but did not publish until the year after his initial literary success. Olesha also wrote several short stories in the 1920s and 1930s, the most prominent of which are &quot;Liompa&quot; (1928), &quot;The Cherry Stone&quot; (1929), and &quot;Natasha&quot; (1936). In addition to prose fiction, Olesha also wrote for the stage, not only adapting his novel &quot;Envy&quot; for the theater in 1929 under the title &quot;Conspiracy of Feelings&quot;, but also writing an original play called &quot;A List of Assets&quot; in 1931 and dramatizing Dostoevsky&#x27;s novel &quot;The Idiot&quot; later in life.

== &quot;The Right to Despair&quot; ==
In the 1930s and 1940s Olesha found it increasingly difficult to publish his work as a result of stringent Stalinist censorship. Speaking to the First Congress of Soviet Writers, he said that he could not write about workers and industrial production, as required of soviet writers, because &quot;it is difficult for me to understand the type of worker, the type of revolutionary hero. I can&#x27;t be them.&quot;

Early in 1936, after Stalin had instigated a public attack on Dmitri Shostakovich, a report filed at the headquarters of the NKVD quoted Olesha as saying that the composer was &quot;a brilliant, and a blow against Shostakovich is a calamity for art.&quot; He had written the script of a film &quot;A Severe Young Man&quot;, directed by Abram Room, which dealt with inequalities in Soviet society, but according to the same police report, he feared it would be banned because it was &quot;many times more left-art than Shostakovich&quot; The film was suppressed until the 1970s. In August 1936, he allowed himself to be pressured into signing a declaration calling for death sentences for the defendants at the first of the Moscow show trials, but when the praesidium of the writers&#x27; union discussed Boris Pasternak&#x27;s refusal to sign a similar denunciation, Olesha defended him as &quot;a perfectly soviet person&quot;.

When Isaac Babel was under arrest, in 1940, he told his interrogators that Olesha was practising &quot;the right to despair&quot;—by getting into a series of loud arguments in taverns. Despite continuing to write and edit, Olesha&#x27;s career was stunted by his political environment, and on 10 May 1960 the author died of heart failure.

<doc id="732361" wikidata="Q4831198" url="?curid=732361" title="Shalford, Surrey">
<text>Shalford is a village and civil parish in the Guildford district, in Surrey, England on the A281 Horsham road immediately south of Guildford. It has a railway station which is between Guildford and Dorking on the Reading to Gatwick Airport line. In 2011 the parish had a population of 4,142.

It has one named locality, occupying the west of the area, Peasmarsh.

Shalford&#x27;s village sign was designed by Christopher Webb and W H Randall Blacking in 1922, as part of a competition run by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. It shows Saint Christopher carrying the Christ Child over a shallow ford.

==History==
Shalford appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Scaldefor&quot;. It was held by Robert de Wateville from Richard Fitz Gilbert. Its Domesday assets were: 4 hides; 1 church, 3 mills worth 16s, 11½ ploughs, of meadow, wood worth 20 hogs. It rendered £20.

The village also became well known for &quot;the Great Fair of Shalford&quot; which was set up by a charter issued by King John. In its heyday, it was said to have covered and attracted merchants from across the country.

The original church, mentioned in the Domesday survey, no longer exists. An early Victorian church now stands in its place. St Mary&#x27;s was built in 1846 with a lychgate and stained glass. Many older cottages do survive. One of the finest properties, Shalford House, dated back to the Tudor period and featured a carved stone fireplace dated 1609. The house was demolished in 1967 to make way for a water treatment plant. There are many Grade II listed structures including stocks and whipping post.

===World War II===
On 11 April 1944 two goods trains collided at . One of them consisted of tankers of aviation fuel en route to airfields in Kent. Leaks from the damaged wagons caused a major fire which was eventually brought under control by the Fire Brigade, with assistance of members of the local police and Home Guard volunteers, who used sandbags to contain the spread of the burning fuel. Nearby properties, including a potato and vegetable store, were badly damaged as was the steel road bridge over the railway that was buckled by the heat. The local pub, the &quot;Queen Victoria&quot;, escaped unharmed.

==Geography==
The River Tillingbourne joins the River Wey at Shalford adjacent to the parish church. For centuries, the river provided an important source of income for the village with various local industries, such the manufacture of gunpowder, utilising it as a source of power. Cranleigh Waters joins the Wey at the northern terminus of the Wey and Arun Canal. Shalford was a landing place for barges, and continues to be visited by boats today – but for pleasure rather than trade.

The surviving mill is now preserved as a tourist attraction: Shalford Mill, a Grade II* listed building, situated in the centre of the village opposite the &quot;Sea Horse&quot; public house, was built in the 18th century and is now owned by the National Trust.

==Notable residents==
Some claim that the author of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, John Bunyan, once lived in hiding in a cottage called &quot;Horn Hatch&quot; on Shalford Common and drew his inspiration from the fair held on the common and from the ancient route known as the Pilgrims&#x27; Way, which passes nearby, on its way to Canterbury.

Lt.Col. Henry Haversham Godwin-Austen (1834–1923), topographer, geologist, naturalist and explorer who surveyed the Himalayan region, including K2, sometimes known as Mt. Godwin-Austen, for a time had an estate in Shalford.

A watercolour sketch titled &#x27;In Captain Pierrepont&#x27;s Grounds&#x27; was painted by Anthony Devis (1729–1817) not long after Captain William Pierrepont of acquired Shalford Manor in 1800.

Brigadier George Roupell, a Victoria Cross recipient, died in Shalford in 1974.

The Genesis singer/drummer Phil Collins had a home in Shalford named &quot;Old Croft&quot;, where he wrote music which would end up on his first solo album &quot;Face Value&quot;, and also the Genesis album, &quot;Duke&quot;.

==Localities==
===Peasmarsh===
The settlement of Peasmarsh on the left bank of the river Wey between Artington and Godalming is contained in the parish. It consists of a retirement home; Astolat and Weyvern business parks; and four short residential roads close to the River Wey Navigation including &quot;Tilthams Green&quot;. A woodland surrounding the rebuilt manor house, being higher up than most of the reclaimed marshland, is named Peas Marsh. A barn at Littlemarsh Farm, one at Tilthams Farm and Tilthams farmhouse are grade II listed. There is a C of E church; St Michael&#x27;s. The water meadows form the Wey Valley SSSI.

==Demography and housing==

The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.
The proportion of households in the civil parish who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

<doc id="732362" wikidata="Q4357658" url="?curid=732362" title="Reino Antero Hirvonen">
<text>Reino Antero Hirvonen (1908–1989) was a famous
Finnish physical geodesist, also well known for
contributions in mathematical and astronomical geodesy.

He worked at first at the Finnish Geodetic Institute under W.A. Heiskanen on gravimetric geoid determination, publishing his dissertation &quot;The Continental Undulations of the Geoid&quot; in 1934 on the determination of a global geoid model from only 4500 data points.

In 1950 he succeeded Heiskanen as Professor of Geodesy at the Helsinki University of Technology.

He also took an active interest in astronomy, acting from 1956 to 1964 as a
vice president of the Finnish amateur astronomical society Ursa.

R.A. Hirvonen participated in the 1930s in the construction of triangulation towers, and measurements, for the first order triangulation of Finland. He also developed over the years many new mathematical algorithms for manual calculations (before the computer era), e.g., for calculating the Gauss-Krüger map projection.

In 1947 he led a team of Finnish scientists to Brazil to measure the distance between South America and Africa. (T.J. Kukkamäki was the leader of the team sent to, then, Gold Coast, Africa.) They succeed with measurements using a method based on observing from points in Brazil and Africa. They used the solar eclipse happening that year, which was visible in both Africa and South America. Using long focus film cameras and the most accurate available radio time signals for the solar eclipse measurements, they were able to calculate the distance between Africa and South America to a higher accuracy than ever before: 141 m.

1951–1952 and 1954–1955 Hirvonen lectured in the Department of Geodetic Science at The Ohio State University, in Columbus, Ohio (USA). He educated the students about navigation using the stars as reference points. Later it helped the USA to fly to the moon.

==Awards==

In 1967 he received the Kaarina and Weikko A. Heiskanen Award (Ohio State University).

<text>Valerius Cordus (18 February 1515 – 25 September 1544) was a German physician, botanist and pharmacologist who authored the first pharmacopoeia North of the Alps and one of the most celebrated herbals in history. He is also widely credited with developing a method for synthesizing ether (which he called by the Latin name &quot;oleum dulci vitrioli&quot;, or &quot;sweet oil of vitriol&quot;).

Cordus wrote prolifically, and identified and described several new plant species and varieties. The plant genus &quot;Cordia&quot; is named for him.

In 1515, Valerius Cordus was born either in the city of Erfurt in what is today Thuringia, or somewhere in the westwardly adjacent state of Hesse. His father, Euricius Cordus (born Heinrich Ritze, 1486–1535), was an educated physician and an ardent Lutheran convert.

Valerius began his higher education in 1527, at the young age of 12, when he enrolled at the University of Marburg, studying botany and pharmacy under the tutelage of his father, who had been appointed professor of medicine at the newly established university in the same year. He completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1531, whereupon he furthered his studies by enrolling at the University of Leipzig, and by working at an apothecary shop in Leipzig owned by his uncle (either Johannes or Joachim).

In 1539 he relocated to Wittenberg in order to lecture and study medicine at the University of Wittenberg. His lectures proved popular, and his students&#x27; lecture notes were published posthumously in 1549 as &quot;Annotations on Dioscorides&quot;. Among the research outlined in the lectures were the results of his own systematic observations of many of the same plants described by Pedanius Dioscorides in the 1st century CE. Direct observation of live specimens was one of Cordus&#x27; strengths.

In 1540 Cordus discovered and described a revolutionary technique for synthesizing ether, which involved adding sulfuric acid to ethyl alcohol.

In 1543, while on his way for a long trip in Italy, he presented his pharmacopoeia, &quot;Dispensatorium&quot;, to the Nuremberg city council. The council paid him 100 gold guilders following the acceptance of the work in October of the same year, and had the work published posthumously in 1546.

In October 1543, Cordus left Nuremberg for Italy. He stayed in Padua and Venice during the winter and next spring. Shortly after Pentecost, he and two German naturalists started to traverse Italy, continuing in the height of summer. In the Maremma, on the Italian westcoast, they ventured into the marshes in search of novel plants. Soon after, Cordus exhibited what may have been the symptoms of malaria. He was also hit on the leg by a horse, causing great pain, and possibly an infection. The party brought the feverish Cordus to Rome, where they arrived on September 1 or 2. When Cordus showed signs of improvement, the rest embarked on a trip to Naples. Cordus, aged 29, died in their absence, on the evening of September 25. He was interred at Santa Maria dell&#x27;Anima, the German Catholic church in central Rome.

== Legacy ==
Throughout his short life, Cordus travelled extensively, visited many universities, and was widely acclaimed by his colleagues and other associates. He was an impressive linguist, and also spoke eloquently on philosophy. As a botanist, he observed with a breadth and depth that surpassed most of his contemporaries; as a scientist, his methodology was systematic and thorough.

After the death of Cordus, Conrad Gessner published a considerable amount of Cordus&#x27; remaining unpublished work, including &quot;De Extractione&quot; (which featured Cordus&#x27; ether synthesis method), &quot;Historia stirpium&quot; and &quot;Sylva&quot; in 1561.

<doc id="732389" wikidata="Q1951159" url="?curid=732389" title="Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People">
<text>The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), is a social movement organization representing the indigenous Ogoni people of Rivers State, Nigeria. The Ogoni contend that Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), along with other petroleum multinationals and the Nigerian government, have destroyed their environment, polluted their rivers, and provided no benefits in return for enormous oil revenues extracted from their lands.

MOSOP is an umbrella organization representing about 700,000 Ogoni in a non-violent campaign for environmental justice in the Niger Delta. Peaceful demonstrations led by MOSOP and other indigenous groups in the region have been brutally suppressed by the Nigerian Mobile Police. Thousands of Ogoni were killed, raped, beaten, detained, or exiled. The Ogoni&#x27;s challenge to state power was finally put down through the judicial murder of Ogoni leaders, including spokesman and founder Ken Saro-Wiwa, in November 1995.

Oil was discovered in the Niger delta in 1957. MOSOP was founded in 1990 by Ken Saro-Wiwa and Ogoni chiefs when they presented the Ogoni Bill of Rights to the Federal government of Nigeria and to the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Peoples in Geneva.

The Ogoni uprising under the leadership of MOSOP was an early and non-violent phase of the conflict in the Niger Delta.

In 1994, MOSOP, along with founder Ken Saro-Wiwa, received the Right Livelihood Award for their exemplary courage in striving non-violently for the civil, economic and environmental rights of their people.

==Background==
The problems facing the Ogoni people find their origins in the British colonial era: the political borders of Nigeria are an extremely artificial creation of British colonialism, with the result that nearly 300 ethnic groups are arbitrarily consolidated into a single nation-state. The Ogoni people are an ethnic micro-minority with only 500,000 people in a country of more than two hundred million. Nigerian politics are dominated by the Yoruba, Igbo, and Hausa–Fulani ethnic majorities. Nigeria gained independence from Britain in 1960, and has since been mostly ruled by unelected officials from these ethnic majorities. The Ogoni lack political power and constitutional protections to control their land or wealth taken from it. Other ethnic groups in the Niger Delta are also ethnic minorities.

=== Unequal distribution of oil benefits ===
Nigeria&#x27;s national government is completely dependent on oil exports, with oil accounting for 80% of government revenue. Shell is the largest stakeholder, owning 47% of the national industry. The World Bank estimates that oil benefits accrue to only 1% of the general population. A 1995 Human Rights Watch interview with attorney Uche Onyeagocha documented that minority groups whose land is the source of over 90% of Nigeria&#x27;s oil opposed the prevailing formula for allocating oil revenues, under which the federal, state, and local governments had almost complete discretion over the distribution of oil proceeds.

By 1995, Ogoniland hosted six oil fields, two oil refineries, and fertilizer and petrochemical plants. MOSOP estimated that $30 billion worth of oil had been extracted from their land within 30 years of discovered reserves, and they had received no benefits but borne the ecological damages of oil production including numerous spills; constant flaring of natural gas; and dumping of toxic waste.

==== Corruption ====
Former World Bank Vice-President for Africa, Dr. Oby Ezekwesili, estimated that $400 billion of Nigeria&#x27;s oil revenue was stolen or misspent from 1960 to 1999. A Nigerian anti-corruption agency estimated that around 70% of oil revenues were wasted or lost to corruption. Nuhu Ribadu&#x27;s Task Force on Oil Revenue found that approximately $29 billion in oil and gas revenues were lost over a period of ten years from cut price deals struck between multinational oil companies and government officials. The report alleges international oil traders sometimes buy crude without any formal contracts, and the state oil firm had short-changed the Nigerian treasury by selling crude oil and gas to itself below market rates.

=== Environmental issues in the Niger Delta ===
Beginning in the late 1950s, multinational oil companies began taking over land belonging to Indigenous farming and fishing communities in the Niger Delta, resulting in environmental devastation. MOSOP spokesman Ken Saro-Wiwa called it an &#x27;ecological war&#x27;:

The Ogoni country has been completely destroyed... Oil blowouts, spillages, oil slicks, and general pollution accompany the search for oil... Oil companies have flared gas in Nigeria for the past thirty three years causing acid rain... What used to be the bread basket of the delta has now become totally infertile. All one sees and feels around is death. Environmental degradation has been a lethal weapon in the war against the indigenous Ogoni people.

Both Shell and Chevron have operated oil wells in Ogoniland.

==== Oil spills ====

Statistics from the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) indicate that between 1976 and 1996 a total of 4,835 incidents resulted in the spillage of at over 2.4 million barrels of oil (102.7 million U.S. gallons), of which an estimated 1.9 million barrels (79.7 million U.S. gallons; 77 percent) were lost to the environment. Nigeria&#x27;s largest spill was an offshore well blowout in January 1980, when at least 200,000 barrels of oil (8.4 million U.S. gallons), according to oil industry sources, spewed into the Atlantic Ocean from a Texaco facility and destroyed of mangroves. Mangrove forest is particularly vulnerable to oil spills, because the soil soaks up the oil like a sponge and re-releases it every rainy season. DPR estimated that more than 400,000 barrels (16.8 million U.S. gallons) were actually spilled in this incident. Water contamination of local water supply resulted in fish kills and ruinous effects on farmland.

==== Gas flaring ====
Nigeria flares more natural gas associated with oil extraction than any other country, with estimates about 70% is wasted by flaring. This is the equivalent to 40% of Africa&#x27;s gas consumption in 2001. Statistical data associated with gas flaring are notoriously unreliable, but Nigeria may waste US$2 billion per year by flaring associated gas. Flaring is done, because it is costly to separate commercially viable associated gas from the oil. Companies operating in Nigeria also harvest natural gas for commercial purposes but prefer to extract it from deposits where it is found in isolation as non-associated gas. Thus associated gas is burned off to decrease costs.

Gas flares are potentially harmful to nearby communities, as they release poisonous chemicals including nitrogen dioxides, sulphur dioxide, volatile organic compounds, as well as carcinogens. These chemicals can aggravate asthma, cause breathing difficulties and pain, as well as chronic bronchitis.

Gas flares are often close to communities and regularly lack fencing or protection for villagers who risk working near their heat. Many communities claim that nearby flares cause acid rain which corrodes their homes and other structures, many of which have zinc-based roofing. Some people resort to using asbestos-based material, which is stronger in repelling acid rain deterioration. Unfortunately, asbestos exposure increases the risk of forming lung cancer, pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, and asbestosis.

==== Effects on Ogoni people ====
In describing the effects of these environmental damages upon his people, the President of MOSOP, Dr. Garrick Barile Leton stated in 1991 that,
Lands, streams and creeks are totally and continually polluted; the atmosphere is for ever charged with hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide; many villages experience the infernal quaking of the wrath of gas flares which have been burning 24 hours a day for 33 years; acid rain, oil spillages and blowouts are common. The result of such unchecked environmental pollution and degradation are that (i) The Ogoni can no longer farm successfully. Once the food basket of the eastern Niger Delta, the Ogoni now buy food (when they can afford it); (ii) Fish, once a common source of protein, is now rare. Owing to the constant and continual pollution of our streams and creeks, fish can only be caught in deeper and offshore waters for which the Ogoni are not equipped. (iii) All wildlife is dead. (iv) The ecology is changing fast. The mangrove tree, the aerial roots of which normally provide a natural and welcome habitat for many a sea food – crabs, periwinkles, mudskippers, cockles, mussels, shrimps and all – is now being gradually replaced by unknown and otherwise useless plants. (v) The health hazards generated by an atmosphere charged with hydrocarbon vapour, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are innumerable.

==== Early protests ====
In 1970, Ogoni Chiefs and Elders of the Ogoni Divisional Commission (W. Nzidee, F. Yowika, N. Ndegwe, E. Kobani, O. Nalelo, Chief A. Ngei and O. Ngofa), submitted a petition to the local Military Governor as a formal complaint against Shell, then operating a joint venture with BP. It brought notice that the company was &quot;seriously threatening the well-being, and even the very lives&quot; of the Ogoni.

Shell&#x27;s response was that the petition was an attempt to place development and other responsibilities on the company and that the &quot;contentions ... bear little relation to what is actually taking place&quot;.

In July 1970, there was a major blow-out at the Bomu oil field in Ogoni, which continued for three weeks, causing widespread pollution and outrage. P. Badom, of the Dere Youths Association, issued a letter of protest, stating:
&quot;Our rivers, rivulets and creeks are all covered with crude oil. We no longer breathe the natural oxygen, rather we inhale lethal and ghastly gases. Our water can no longer be drunk unless one wants to test the effect of crude oil on the body. We no longer use vegetables, they are all polluted.&quot;
The Iko people wrote to Shell in 1980 demanding &quot;compensation and restitution of our rights to clean air, water and a viable environment where we can source for our means of livelihood&quot;.

In 1987, when the Iko once again held a peaceful demonstration against Shell, the Mobile Police Force (MPF) destroyed 40 houses, and 350 people were made homeless.

==History==
MOSOP was the outgrowth of such protests during the 1970s and 1980s. Ken Saro-Wiwa initiated the idea of MOSOP and attracted a mix of educated Ogoni elites and chiefs, including its first president Dr. Garrick Barile Leton. Goodluck Diigbo, President of the National Youth Council of Ogoni People, (NYCOP) established seven of the ten affiliates that made up MOSOP. Chief E. N. Kobani became vice president of MOSOP.

MOSOP&#x27;s first effort was the 1990 Ogoni Bill of Rights addressed to the federal government, the people of Nigeria, and as an appeal to the international community. The Ogoni demands were: political autonomy to participate in the affairs of the Republic as a distinct and separate unit, provided that this autonomy guaranteed political control of Ogoni affairs by Ogoni people; the right to control and use a fair proportion of Ogoni economic resources for Ogoni development; adequate representation in Nigerian national institutions; and the right to protect the Ogoni environment and ecology from further degradation. Military president Ibrahim Babangida, made no reply to these demands.

=== Ogoni Bill of Rights ===
In August 1990, the Ogoni elders signed the Ogoni Bill of Rights, demanding &quot;political control of Ogoni affairs by Ogoni people, control and use of Ogoni economic resources for Ogoni development, adequate and direct representation as a right for Ogoni people in all Nigerian national institutions, and the right to protect the Ogoni environment and ecology from further degradation.&quot;

MOSOP presented the Bill of Rights to several parties: the Federal government of Nigeria; the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Peoples in Geneva; the UN sub-committee on Human Rights; the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights; and Greenpeace. The Ogoni case was also presented to the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization in 1993.

They also stated that Shell bore “full responsibility for the genocide of the Ogoni.”

The Bill summaraised the sufferings of the Ogoni peoples and their political marginalisation and neglect by the government. They also defined themselves as &quot;a separate and distinct ethnic nationality&quot;, and demanded participation in national affairs as &quot;a distinct and separate unit&quot;.

The Ogoni Bill of Rights stated that:The Ogoni people will make representation to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to the effect that giving loans and credit to the Nigerian Government on the understanding that oil money will be used to repay such loans is to encourage the Nigerian government to continue to dehumanise the Ogoni people and to devastate the environment and ecology of the Ogoni and other delta minorities among whom oil is found.
The Ogoni people will inform the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity that the Nigerian Constitution and the actions of the power elite in Nigeria flagrantly violate the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the African Charter of Human and Peoples Rights; and that Nigeria in 1992 is no different from Apartheid South Africa. The Ogoni people will ask that Nigeria be duly chastised by both organizations for its inhuman actions and uncivilized behaviour. And if Nigeria persists in its perversity, then it should be expelled from both organizations.

=== Early uprisings 1990–93 ===

==== Umuechem protests ====
In late October, 1990, protests at a Shell facility in the Umuechem community of Etche brought the situation in the Niger Delta to international attention. In anticipation of the protests, Shell requested the presence of the paramilitary MPF, who killed approximately 80 unarmed demonstrators and destroyed or severely damaged 495 houses. A government inquiry later found that villagers posed no threat and concluded that the MPF&#x27;s violence was in &quot;reckless disregard for lives and property.”

==== Ogoni uprising ====
From 1990 to 1993, MOSOP responded to the failure of previous petitions to elicit a response from the government or the oil companies by increasingly asserting their right to self-determination and their right to confront the oil companies directly. MOSOP leaders campaigned amongst various local clans and mounted media campaigns, promising monetary compensation for damages if their campaign succeeded.

In 1992, the conflict escalated as MOSOP demanded that Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), Chevron, and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), pay $10 billion in compensation to Ogoni people, immediately stop environmental degradation, and negotiate with Ogoni people to reach acceptable terms for further oil extraction. If the companies failed to comply within 30 days, the Ogonis threatened mass action to disrupt their operations. By this act, the Ogonis shifted the focus of their actions from an unresponsive federal government to oil companies actively engaged in their own region.

===== Shell withdrawal =====
In January 1993, the national government responded by banning public gatherings and declaring that disturbances of oil production were acts of treason. In spite of the ban, MOSOP went ahead with a massive public mobilization on January 4, 1993. The event, called the first Ogoni Day, attracted about 300,000 people in massive festivities. Saro-wiwa and other MOSOP leaders were arrested. Over the next month as the mobilization continued, a Shell employee was beaten by an Ogoni mob. As a security measure, Shell Petroleum Development Company withdrew its employees from Ogoniland. Oil extraction from the territory slowed to (.5% of the national total).

In June, 1993 the Ogoni boycotted Presidential elections.

===== Ogoni-Andoni violence =====
On July 9 At least 60 Ogoni people are killed, allegedly by Andoni, when arriving back from the Cameroon Republic by boat. This &quot;incident&quot; marks the beginning of Ogoni-Andoni violence. August 5 – Kaa is the first village attacked in the Andoni-Ogoni conflict, resulting in 33 deaths and 8,000 refugees. Over the coming months, similar incidents occur in over 20 other villages. MOSOP accuses Shell of being behind the Andoni-Ogoni violence.

=== Execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and the Ogoni Nine (1994) ===

On May 21, 1994, four Ogoni chiefs (all on the conservative side of a schism within MOSOP over strategy) were murdered. Saro-Wiwa (head of the radical faction), was detained in connection with the killings, although he had been denied entry to Ogoniland on the day of the murders. Rivers State Military Administrator Lt. Col. Dauda Komo did not wait for a judicial investigation to blame the killings on &quot;irresponsible and reckless thuggery of the MOSOP element&quot;.

Witnesses said that Rivers State Internal Security engaged in terror operations against the general Ogoni population while claiming to search for people responsible for the killings of the four Ogoni leaders. Amnesty International characterized the policy as deliberate terrorism. By mid-June, 30 villages had been completely destroyed, 600 people had been detained, and at least 40 had been killed. An eventual total of around 100,000 internal refugees and an estimated 2,000 civilian deaths was recorded.

==== Arrest and summary execution of Ogoni nine ====
Ken Saro-Wiwa, N. G. Dube, and Kobari Nwilewas were arrested in Port Harcourt on June 21, 1993. The three were charged on 13 July 1993 with six counts relating to unlawful assembly, seditious intention and seditious publication. Bail was not set and all three remanded in custody until September 20.

On November 10, 1995, nine activists from the movement, Barinem Kiobel, John Kpunien, Baribor Bera, Saturday Dobee, Felix Nwate, Nordu Eawo, Paul Levura, and Daniel Gbokoo along Ken Saro-Wiwa, were hanged 10 days after being convicted by the Nigerian government on charges of &quot;incitement to murder&quot; of the four Ogoni leaders. In the final address to the military-appointed tribunal, Saro-Wiwa describes the actions of Shell Corporation as war crimes against the Ogoni People:
I repeat that we all stand before history. I and my colleagues are not the only ones on trial. Shell is here on trial and it is as well that it is represented by counsel said to be holding a watching brief. The Company has, indeed, ducked this particular trial, but its day will surely come and the lessons learnt here may prove useful to it for there is no doubt in my mind that the ecological war that the Company has waged in the Delta will be called to question sooner than later and the crimes of that war be duly punished. The crime of the Company&#x27;s dirty wars against the Ogoni people will also be punished.

&quot;Excerpt from:&quot; 
An anonymous interview revealed a first hand telling of that day and the events that took place;Everywhere was quiet and then on the morning of May 21st ... as we woke up in the morning most of the Ogoni communities were filled with soldiers and mobile policemen armed with sophisticated weapons. We don’t (sic) know why they just came, it was only when four prominent Ogoni sons were killed later in the afternoon of that day that we in Ogoni ever knew that there was a grand design to cause disturbances in Ogoni in order to create an excuse for the government to send in more troops

==== International response ====
Saro-Wiwa&#x27;s death provoked international outrage and the immediate suspension of Nigeria from the Commonwealth of Nations as well as the withdrawal of many foreign diplomats from Nigeria. According to the Nigerian Medical Association&#x27;s President, these were the fastest executions in the West African nation&#x27;s history. Nigerian human rights activists and opposition groups had long urged the Commonwealth and the United States to impose economic sanctions on the Nigerian government. This they argued was the opportune time to &quot;turn the screws on&quot; Nigeria&#x27;s military government by boycotting its oil. The United States, which buys half of Nigeria&#x27;s oil, declined through a press statement.

=== 1997–present ===
On January 4, 1998, Ogoni national day, the Rivers State Internal Security Task Force (RVISTF), arrested dozens of activists and raided several villages.

==== Saro-Wiwa vs. Shell ====
==== Demands for Saro-Wiwa&#x27;s exoneration ====
On November 10, 2014, MOSOP President Legborsi Saro Pyagbara, at the 19th anniversary commemoration of the &quot;Ogoni Martyrs&quot; held in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, called on the federal government to clear the late activist, Ken Saro-Wiwa, and the other nine Ogoni people executed by General Sani Abacha&#x27;s government for murder. Pyagbara recalled that the UN, which monitored the trial of Saro-Wiwa and the Ogoni Nine, observed that the returned verdict did not follow any known local or international standard.

Compelling new evidence suggests the Nigerian military killed four Ogoni elders whose murders led to the execution of the playwright and activist Ken Saro-Wiwa in 1995. The evidence also reveals that the notorious military commander Lieutenant-Colonel Paul Okuntimo, whose troops were implicated in other crimes, was in the pay of Shell at the time of the killings and was driven around in a Shell vehicle.

<doc id="732394" wikidata="Q850042" url="?curid=732394" title="Uppsala Cathedral">
<text>Uppsala Cathedral () is a cathedral located between the University Hall of Uppsala University and the Fyris river in the centre of Uppsala, Sweden. A church of the Church of Sweden, the national church, in the Lutheran tradition, Uppsala Cathedral is the seat of the Archbishop of Uppsala, the primate of Sweden. It is also the burial site of King Eric IX (c. 1120–1160, reigned 1156–1160), who became the patron saint of the nation, and it was the traditional location for the coronation of new Kings of Sweden.

The current archbishop is Martin Modéus and the current bishop is Karin Johannesson.

The cathedral dates to the late 13th century and, at a height of , it is the tallest church in the Nordic countries. Originally built under Roman Catholicism, it was used for coronations of Swedish monarchs for a lengthy period following the Protestant Reformation. Several of its chapels were converted to house the tombs of Swedish monarchs, including Gustav Vasa and John III. Carl Linnaeus, Olaus Rudbeck, Emanuel Swedenborg, and several archbishops are also buried here.

The church was designed in the French Gothic style by French architects including Étienne de Bonneuil. It is in the form of a cross formed by the nave and transept. Most of the structure was built between 1272 and 1420 but the western end was completed only in the middle of the 15th century. Twin towers were built shortly afterwards on the west end of the church. High spires were added later, but after a fire in 1702, they were adorned with low helms by Carl Hårleman in 1735. They were completely redesigned by Helgo Zetterwall who undertook substantial changes to the building in the 1880s. The cathedral&#x27;s principal construction material is brick but the pillars and many details are of Gotland limestone.

The vaults were all built according to the original 13th-century plan although some of them were erected as late as around 1440. In addition to the artwork in the funeral chapels, several of the church&#x27;s older furnishings can be seen in the Treasury Museum. In 1702, many features were destroyed in a major fire. During the renovation work carried out in the 1970s, many of the medieval frescoes which had been whitewashed over after the Reformation were uncovered and restored.

==History==
At the end of the Viking Age, the pagan temple at Gamla Uppsala (Old Uppsala), about to the north of today&#x27;s Uppsala, was replaced by a Christian church. Although the exact date of its construction is not known, in 1123 Siward was ordained Bishop of Uppsala by the Archbishop of Bremen-Hamburg. It is however uncertain if Siward ever assumed office, as he had been expelled and was in Germany in the early 1130s. The catalogue of bishops mentions Severeinus as the first bishop, and he may have been the replacement for Siward. Henrik, &#x27;Finland&#x27;s Apostle&#x27;, was the fourth bishop. In 1164, Sweden became an archbishopric under the control of Lund. The first archbishop was the Cistercian monk Stefan of Alvastra.

After the cathedral in Gamla Uppsala was damaged by fire in 1204, the Chapter sought permission from the Holy See to move the building to a larger site. Pope Alexander IV granted this request in 1258 on condition that the name of Uppsala be maintained. At a meeting in Söderköping in September 1270, Archbishop Fulco Angelus and the cathedral chapter decided the site should be in Östra Aros. Formal authorization of the move was issued in 1271 by Bishop Carolus of Västerås whom the Pope had appointed to oversee the case.

About 1272, work began on building a new cathedral in Östra Aros near the Fyris River to the south. It was constructed on the site of the earlier stone church dedicated to the Holy Trinity, located almost exactly where the cathedral&#x27;s chancel now stands. It was here that Sweden&#x27;s patron saint Eric Jedvardsson had attended mass before he was murdered in 1160. The name of Uppsala was kept, and the surrounding town Östra Aros soon changed its name accordingly. The relics of Saint Eric, the treasure of Uppsala, were moved from Gamla Uppsala to the new site in 1273, along with the formal move of the archbishopric. The church was designed by French architects although the name of the author of the detailed initial plans who supervised work until 1281 has not been recorded. In 1287, a promissory note drawn up by the provost of Paris covers the expenses to be incurred by master builder Étienne de Bonneuil and his assistants in travelling to Sweden to work on the construction of a cathedral at Uppsala. Étienne is credited with work at the east and south chapels of the chancel, the transepts and probably the south portal, although in most of his work he appears to have meticulously followed the plans of his predecessor. Progress was slow as a result of the cold climate, the plague and many financial difficulties. It was not until the end of the 14th century that work on the initial plans was completed, thanks in particular to the contribution of the master builder Nikolaus från Västerås who began construction of the nave.

When consecrated in 1435 by Archbishop Olaus Laurentii, the cathedral still was not complete. It was dedicated to Saint Lawrence, highly cherished in all of Sweden at that time; Saint Eric, the patron saint of Sweden (though never canonised by the Roman Catholic Church); and Saint Olaf, the patron saint of Norway. It was completed over the following decades. Although there are no documentary records of the consecration, there are several references from the same period to the cathedral&#x27;s chapels, including their altars which were dedicated to the Holy Cross, to the Virgin Mary or to other saints. The last main component of the cathedral, the towers, were built between 1470 and 1489. The cathedral was damaged by fire on several occasions, especially during the great fire of 1702 which destroyed much of the city. Restoration work was not completed until the middle of the century.
The church was not the regular place of worship of laypeople until the Reformation. It was reserved for official services of the Catholic Church hierarchy (by the cathedral&#x27;s canons). The parish churches in Uppsala were the Holy Trinity Church or &quot;Bondkyrkan&quot;, &#x27;Peasant Church&#x27;, as it was often called; Church of Saint Peter; Church of Our Lady; and a Franciscan friary. The last three had been built on the east side of the Fyris River, which was the central business district, and remains so to date. They were successively torn down during the Reformation. The cathedral was also the coronation church for many of Sweden&#x27;s kings and queens until 1719. It was the site of celebrating coronations from the Middle Ages until the end of the 17th century. Stockholm&#x27;s Cathedral &quot;Storkyrkan&quot; became the official coronation church.
From 1885 to 1893, the architect Helgo Zettervall (1831–1907) undertook comprehensive restoration work, seeking to give the cathedral a French High Gothic appearance although he has been criticized for not respecting the building&#x27;s original Baltic Gothic style. He also added pointed French spires to the towers, bringing the cathedral up to a height of , so making it as high as it was long. In an attempt to give the cathedral a slimmer appearance, Zettervall significantly altered large portions of the medieval outer brick walls and removed the decorative white-washed &#x27;blind windows&#x27; on the gables which had been similar to those on the nearby Holy Trinity Church.

Further renovation work in the early 1970s led to improvements in the building&#x27;s structure and included restoration of the walls and windows. Large portions of cement additions by Zettervall to the exterior structure of the cathedral were removed decades later as they adversely affected the building&#x27;s fabric. In 1989, Pope John Paul II took part in an ecumenical service in Uppsala Cathedral with Archbishop Bertil Werkström. Fire protection equipment was installed in 2010 and the electrical and heating systems have been replaced.

==Architecture==
The cathedral is the tallest church building in Scandinavia. Its height of is the same as its length while it has a breadth of . The height inside is . The church was designed in the French High Gothic style by French master builders including Étienne de Bonneuil. Built high on a gravel ridge southwest of the River Fyris, its Latin cross ground plan consists of a three-aisled basilica (a central nave flanked by two lateral aisles) with single-aisle transepts, and a four-bay chancel with an ambulatory surrounded by five chapels. The seven-bay nave is bordered by chantry chapels on either side. Starting with the eastern end of the church and the chapels surrounding the chancel, most of the structure was built between 1270 and 1420 but the western end of the nave was completed only in the middle of the 15th century while the towers took decades more to complete. The principal material is red brick but the cathedral was built on a stone foundation and the chancel pillars and many details are of Gotland limestone. (The nave pillars were originally of brick but were replaced with limestone as part of the restoration work carried out under Helgo Zettervall from 1885 to 1893.)

The twin towers at the west end of the church were first mentioned in 1563. Several additions to both the interior and exterior of the church were made after a fire in 1572 under the leadership of Franciscus Pahr, known for his work on castles. The turret and pinnacles which can be seen in older drawings were added as well as the first spires on the west towers which were designed by Antonius Watz. In the 1690s, Nicodemus Tessin designed a new burial chapel to the east of the south transept, the most significant alteration to the plan of the cathedral since the Middle Ages. From the outside, his design respected the traditions of medieval architecture with tall Gothic windows but the interior was decorated in Tessin&#x27;s usual Classical Baroque style.

In the 17th century, the towers were redesigned in the Dutch Renaissance style but after the serious fire of 1702 they were temporarily replaced by low wooden tops. At the same time, the buttresses were removed giving the cathedral the rather plain look conveyed by pictures of the period. Only in 1740 were copper-faced spires installed, designed by Carl Hårleman. At the same time, Hårleman carried out significant work on the west façade. Today&#x27;s towers are the work of Helgo Zettervall who completely rebuilt them in the 1880s, substantially increasing their height. After the serious fire of 1702, the original flying buttresses were removed and a higher roof was built.

Although the cathedral was designed by French architects, it exhibits a number of differences from the cathedrals of northern France. Above all, it is essentially constructed of brick rather than stone. Brick could easily be produced locally but stone had to be imported from the distant quarries of Gotland. As bricks and mortar are not as strong as stone, the walls had to be thicker although the pillars needed to support the vaulted ceiling of the chancel were made of limestone (although those in the nave are of brick). The north transept portal is also built of limestone, no doubt as it was needed to support the rose window, also structured in limestone itself. While the chancel and the transept are clearly of French design, the nave which was built somewhat later displays German and Swedish characteristics. Constructed in about 1330, the rose window over the northeast portal is still entirely French. Nicolaus from Västerås, the Swede who directed work on the nave from the 1360s, appears to have slightly modified the original plans, adding confessional side-chapels and including a few features of German origin. Cross-vaults were nevertheless installed, rather than star-shaped vaults which were more common at the time. Work on the western end of the building began in 1431 with the construction of the west portal which was influenced by the style of Vadstena Abbey. The towers, however, still exhibited features typical of 13th-century French architecture, indicating that the original plans were still in use at the time. Overall, despite minor differences, Uppsala Cathedral still reflects the style of the 13th-century cathedrals of northern France.

==Interior==
The Coronation Vault stands above the point at which the transept crosses the nave. It is where most of Sweden&#x27;s monarchs were crowned from the Middle Ages until 1719. During the restoration in the 1880s, the interior ceiling and walls of the cathedral were decorated in the Neo-Gothic style. Some depictions, such as one of the Reformation&#x27;s Martin Luther, added figures beyond the cathedral&#x27;s medieval heritage. During the renovation work carried out in the 1970s, many of the medieval frescoes which had been whitewashed over after the Reformation were uncovered and restored.
The high altar is used for the cathedral&#x27;s services on the most important feast days in the church calendar. It is also here that all Swedish bishops are ordained. The silver chandelier is from 1647. The large crucifix in silver and crystal from Orrefors was installed in 1976.

===Chapels===

The cathedral&#x27;s largest chapel, the Vasa Chapel, at the eastern end of the chancel, was originally known as the Chapel of the Virgin Mary. It later became a burial monument for Gustav Vasa and his family. Completed in 1583, it is decorated with the national arms of Sweden as well as with some of the oldest known Swedish and Finnish coats of arms.
The Finsta Chapel or St Eric&#x27;s Chapel on the north-west corner of the chancel houses the relics of Eric the Holy, the patron saint of Sweden, who was killed in 1160 on the site where Uppsala Cathedral was later built. His shrine was moved from the first cathedral in Gamla Uppsala as soon as work began on the new building. In 1580, King John III melted his shrine down but replaced it with a new gold-plated one which still contains Eric&#x27;s relics and crown. The name Finsta originates from the Uppland estate where Judge Birger Persson and his wife were born. They were entombed in the chapel in 1328. A relic of their daughter Saint Bridget housed in a small gold-plated shrine was donated by the Saint Bridget Order in 1990.

Next to the Finsta Chapel, the Sture Chapel is the memorial tomb of the three members of the Sture family who were murdered by King Eric XIV in 1567. The reredos (1520) depicts the story of Mary&#x27;s parents, Anne and Joachim. At the end of the 16th century, the church&#x27;s sacristy was converted into a burial chapel for Queen Catherine Jagiellon or Katarina Jagiellonica, the wife of King John III, who is also entombed there. The Jagellonica Chapel takes its name from her. The monument, crowned by a marble vault, was designed by Willem Boy.

===Windows===
Several windows maintain their original shape and size. The original stained-glass decorations were almost all lost in the 1702 fire and were simply replaced by normal glass. The current stained-glass designs were added during the renovation at the end of the 19th century, most of them by the Gothenburg firm, Svenska Glasmåleri. The large windows above the portals depict the Trinity: God the Father over the west door, God the Son above the south door (the largest in the church), and God the Holy Spirit above the north door. Crafted in limestone, the rose window at the north portal is the oldest, unchanged since the 13th century.

===Treasury and artefacts===
Located in the north tower, the cathedral Treasury Museum displays a number of gold and silver articles used in the religious services. There is also a collection of textiles including Queen Margaret&#x27;s golden gown. The burial regalia of Gustav Vasa, John III and their wives can also be seen.

Other artefacts in the cathedral include tapestries in the Chapel of Remembrance from 1976 which record important events in the cathedral&#x27;s history. The ornate pulpit (1710), the largest in Sweden, was designed by Nicodemus Tessin and carved by Burchard Precht. It was a gift from Queen Hedvig Eleonora after the fire of 1702. Decorations include John the Baptist preaching in the desert, Saint Paul in Athens and the parable of the Labourers in the Vineyard.

One of the new bells installed after the devastating fire of 1702 is called Thornan. It was taken from Toruń, Poland as war booty in 1703 by the Swedish forces of Carl XII during the Great Northern War.

In the Vasa Chapel, there are seven large fresco paintings executed by Johan Gustaf Sandberg (1782–1854) over a period of several years. They depict important events in the life of Gustav Vasa. One of the most famous is &quot;Talet till dalkarlarna vid Mora kyrka&quot; (Speech to the people of Dalarna outside Mora Church). Frescos also decorate the vaults of the nave.

Initially, as in some of the continental cathedrals, the interior was decorated with designs emphasizing the arch ribs and portal components. Even the brick was painted with red and white stripes. In the 15th century, frescos of figures in the Late Gothic style with decorative vine leaves were painted in various parts of the church. Traces of these have been found in the chancel and in the chapel which was originally dedicated to St Eric and St Olaf. They have now been heavily restored. The frescos in the chancel were probably painted by Albertus Pictor&#x27;s workshop.

===&quot;Judensau&quot;===

The cathedral features a &quot;Judensau&quot; (&quot;Jews&#x27; sow&quot;) that depicts several Jewish men suckling a pig. The Uppsala &quot;Judensau&quot; is likely the work of a travelling German artist, given the popularity of the antisemitic motif in German-speaking lands.

==Interred notables==
A number of Swedish monarchs and other notable people were buried inside the cathedral:
* Gustav Vasa, 16th-century King of Sweden. Nearly a decade before his death, he had expressed a wish to be buried in the cathedral. He is buried with his three wives, although only two are depicted on the sarcophagus designed by Willem Boy. The king and his wives are interred in what was once the Chapel of the Virgin Mary. The only remaining indication of the original intention of the chapel are the painted yellow stars against a blue background on its vaulted ceiling, symbols of Saint Mary in Catholic tradition.
* John III (died 1592), the second son of Gustav Vasa, and his second wife Gunilla Bielke are also buried in the Virgin Mary Chapel. His first wife, Catherine Jagiellon from Poland, has a burial chapel of her own on the north side of the chancel.
* Princess Elizabeth (died 1597), Gustav Vasa&#x27;s youngest daughter is buried in the Finsta Chapel adjacent to Virgin Mary&#x27;s Chapel.
* The noblemen Svante Sture (1517–1567) and his sons Nils (1543–1567) and Erik (1546–1567) who were all killed by Erik XIV in the Sture Murders are entombed in the Sture Chapel. The clothes they were wearing at the time of their death are displayed in the Treasury Museum.
* Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778), the 18th-century world-famous botanist and professor at Uppsala University, has a memorial designed by Tobias Sergel next to the Chapel of Remembrance.
* Charles De Geer (1720–1778), industrialist, civil servant and entomologist.
* Olaus Rudbeck, Swedish polymath and one of the discoverers of the lymphatic system.
* Emanuel Swedenborg, 18th-century scientist and mystic. He was not originally interred here, but his remains were transported to Uppsala from England in 1908.
* Nathan Söderblom (1866–1931), archbishop of Uppsala and Nobel Peace Prize recipient. His tomb is at the foot of the steps to the high altar.
* Eric the Saint, 12th-century king and national saint, whose relics are in the Finsta Chapel.
* Laurentius Petri (1499–1573), Sweden&#x27;s first Lutheran archbishop, buried at the foot of the altar steps.
* Relics of Saint Bridget or &quot;Heliga Birgitta&quot; (1303–1373) have been placed in a shrine in the Finsta Chapel inspired by the clothing of the Saint Bridget Order.
* Folke Johansson Ängel, Archbishop of Uppsala (1267–1277)

===Dag Hammarskjöld memorial===
In the cathedral there is a small memorial to Dag Hammarskjöld, former Secretary-General of the United Nations, who was posthumously awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. A stone bears the inscription:

:Icke jag
:utan Gud i mig
:::::Dag Hammarskjöld 1905 – 1961

The English translation is &quot;Not I, but God in me.&quot;

==Open to visitors==
The cathedral is located on Domkyrkoplan in the centre of Uppsala. It is open to visitors most days from 8 am to 6 pm. The Treasury Museum in the north tower is open from 10 am to 4 pm, Sundays from 12.30 pm.

<text>William Kenwright (4 September 1945 – 23 October 2023) was an English theatre and film producer. He was also the chairman of Everton Football Club for nearly two decades, from 2004 until his death in 2023.

== Early life ==
Kenwright was born in Liverpool and attended Booker Avenue County Primary School, and then Liverpool Institute High School for Boys (predecessor to LIPA) from 1957 to 1964. He was treasurer of the Christian Union at school.

Kenwright was a judge in the 2007 BBC One television series &quot;Any Dream Will Do&quot;.

==Theatre==
As a theatre producer, Kenwright is best known for the long-running West End hit &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; and the record-breaking UK tour of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;. Other productions have included West End runs of &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot; at the Palace Theatre, &quot;Festen&quot; in London, on a UK tour and on Broadway, &quot;The Big Life&quot;, &quot;Elmina&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, &quot;Scrooge – The Musical&quot;, &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot;, &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, &quot;A Man For All Seasons&quot; alongside UK tours of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, &quot;Tommy&quot;, &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot; and &quot;This is Elvis&quot;. He produced the London revival of &quot;Cabaret&quot; at the Lyric Theatre in September 2006, starring Anna Maxwell Martin, James Dreyfus and Sheila Hancock.

Kenwright helped start the careers of many current West End theatre producers, including Mark Rubinstein and Marc Sinden. It has been estimated that he employed more actors in a year than any employer other than the BBC.

Kenwright also directed many productions, including &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;, &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot;; he was asked by Andrew Lloyd Webber to make changes to the direction of &quot;Love Never Dies&quot;. Bill Kenwright additionally produced &amp; directed the 2018/19 UK touring production of &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, in which Richard Winsor (as the preliminary Tony Manero) perceived the symbolic &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot; dance spectacle as &quot;The Kneebreaker&quot; &amp; he gleefully presented the deceiving &quot;Stage Pose&quot; downgrade (created by Arlene Phillips in 1997).

Productions, mainly musicals, included:
* &quot;Fame&quot; – UK National Tour (2014)
* &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; – Phoenix Theatre, London and on UK National Tour, starring Helen Hobson and Steven Houghton

==Music==
Kenwright had his own record label (Bill Kenwright Records), which released a number of albums: the London Palladium cast recording of &quot;Scrooge&quot; (starring Tommy Steele) and the 2006 Lyric Theatre Recording of &quot;Cabaret&quot; were joined in February 2008 by the debut album of Kenwright&#x27;s new boy group Dream On. BK Records also released Joe McElderry&#x27;s 4th album Saturday Night at the Movies, and a soundtrack of Joe singing Joseph and His Technicolour Dreamcoat.

Dream On, comprising five runners up from the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Any Dream Will Do&quot; – Craig Chalmers, Lewis Bradley, Chris Crosby, Chris Barton and Antony Hansen was formed in January 2008.

Kenwright began his music career in a band known as the Chevrolets. Perhaps less known is Kenwright&#x27;s recording career both solo and with a group
Bill Kenwright and the Runaways:
* &quot;I want to go back there again&quot;/&quot;Walk through dreams&quot; Columbia DB8239 (August 1967)

and solo, as Bill Kenwright:
* &quot;Love&#x27;s Black &amp; White&quot;/&quot;Giving Up&quot; MGM 1430 (July 1968)
* &quot;Tiggy&quot;/&quot;House That Fell on its Face&quot; MGM 1463 (November 1968)
* &quot;Baby I Could Be So Good at Loving&quot;/&quot;Boy &amp; a Girl&quot; MGM 1478 (January 1969)
* &quot;Sugar Man&quot;/&quot;Epitaph&quot;/&quot;When Times Were Good&quot; Fontana TF 1065 (October 1969)

Kenwright tried his hand at record production in 1969, producing two singles for Manchester band Money, who also worked as his backing band for several cabaret gigs in Oldham and at Allinson&#x27;s, Liverpool. The first record, &quot;Come Laughing Home&quot;, was the title music for Kenwright&#x27;s first foray into theatrical production, with Reginald Marsh (also a star of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;) as co-producer. The show starred Anne Reid, who at the time was playing Valerie Barlow in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. It was the first time a &quot;Coronation Street&quot; star had worked in live theatre whilst still acting in the series. The show opened at Blackpool&#x27;s Grand Theatre. The single was also released in Argentina.

==Actor==

As a young man he became an actor. His early successes included a role in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as Gordon Clegg, who was introduced in April 1968. Kenwright left the show after a year to pursue his producing career in March 1969, although he did return to the show on occasion throughout the 1970s for guest appearances. He continued to appear in Coronation Street occasionally until 2012. He had brief stints in other shows, such as &quot;The Villains&quot; and &quot;The Liver Birds&quot;, and appeared in the films &quot;Carry On Matron&quot; (1972), as a reporter, and &quot;England, My England&quot; (1995). From 1997 he managed the Theatre Royal in Windsor.

==Everton Football Club==
Kenwright was the chairman of Everton Football Club. He succeeded Littlewoods director Philip Carter in the role. Kenwright remained on the Everton board since 23 October 1989 and up until his death in 2023. He became the second largest shareholder in 1999, when Peter Johnson sold his shareholding after the Football Association told him to sell his interests in either Tranmere Rovers or Everton. He became the largest stakeholder in the club in 2004.

Scottish international forward Andy Gray reported in his autobiography that the Everton board were ready to offer Gray the job as manager in August 1997, but Kenwright, then director, had wanted to appoint Howard Kendall as manager for a third time. Gray would decide not to become Everton manager and Kendall was appointed.

===1994 buyout proposal===
Kenwright became involved in a consortium to buy Everton in 1994, as his consortium rivalled Birkenhead-based Peter Johnson. Kenwright&#x27;s consortium had assurances from the Everton owner&#x27;s family head Lady Grantchester that the Moores family would sell their stake in the club. Kenwright&#x27;s proposal was dismissed as the &quot;Manchester Consortium&quot; in the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot;, as the rivalry between Liverpool and Manchester was enough to deter supporters&#x27; support. Kenwright&#x27;s consortium included Manchester-based Tom Cannon, Tony Tighe (who later went on to create the Everton Collection) and Mike Dyble, whilst building magnate Arthur Abercromby was Cheshire-based. Abercromby offered a £2 million interest-free loan to the club for the purchase of players.

Kenwright, who had been a director at Everton for ten years, had an opportunity to sway the board members to accept his bid but chose not to because he did not want a public relations battle with the more affluent Johnson. Tighe, in an interview with a journalist David Conn, said: &quot;Bill didn&#x27;t want a public row, that&#x27;s why he didn&#x27;t go to press much. He wanted the board to be unanimous. As he saw it, he didn&#x27;t want Everton&#x27;s name to be dragged through controversy.&quot; Peter Johnson&#x27;s bid was accepted by the Everton board. Johnson installed Kenwright (the half Belgian half English theatre impresario) as vice-chairman and Sir Philip Carter was re-instated as chairman.

===1999 buyout proposal and True Blue Holdings===
Kenwright&#x27;s consortium bought 68% of Everton F.C. from Peter Johnson for £20 million in 1999. A holding company called True Blue (Holdings) Ltd was formed in January 2000. The stakeholders in True Blue Holdings included Paul Gregg, Jimmy Mulville, Jon Woods and Willy Russell before it was dissolved in 2004. Mihir Bose reported that Anita Gregg lent up to £7 million to Kenwright. Upon completion of the deal, Kenwright said: &quot;Acquiring Peter Johnson&#x27;s shares is only the first step to restoring a great club to where it belongs – to where it should be. If you are going to run a successful football club you need two qualities: you need to be realistic and you need a plan. I&#x27;m realistic and I have a plan.&quot;

In 2003, he attempted to move Everton to the Kings Dock on the riverside but after a public feud with director Paul Gregg over the proposal&#x27;s finances and the sale of Wayne Rooney, the move fell through. Gregg had wanted to keep Rooney at the club and Kenwright reluctantly felt it was best he be sold to ease the club&#x27;s financial burden. Paul and Anita Gregg later sold their shares to Florida-based businessman Robert Earl. Kenwright&#x27;s close friend Philip Green is believed to have helped him secure the club after being approached for help.

===Chairmanship===
On 1 June 2004, Kenwright became chairman of Everton Football Club. On the same day, Trevor Birch was appointed chief executive officer to replace the outgoing Michael Dunford. Kenwright said that Birch would be his &quot;sounding board&quot; and that the new CEO should &quot;dictate the policy of the football club&quot;. Kenwright stated that Birch had not been brought in to sell the club, but that a new investor can have his shares as long as they &quot;have money to run the club&quot;. Birch resigned six weeks later. He resigned after a meeting with True Blue Holding (Kenwright, Woods, Gregg and Abercromby) where the board opted to not to sell the club. Gregg claimed there was a refusal to relinquish control by other directors and that it was preventing progress at the club.

====Fortress Sports Fund====
In August 2004, it was reported that a Brunei-based fund Fortess Sports Fund (FSF) were interested in buying a stake in Everton. Following the public fall-out with director Paul Gregg, it was anticipated that Gregg&#x27;s shares in addition to others would be sold to the fund. Kenwright and Everton director Jon Woods were in favour of accepting the investment whilst Paul Gregg was sceptical and refused to endorse it. Gregg believed that the fund under-valued his investment, it was reported that the fund&#x27;s bid was £12.8 million for 29.9% of the club.

In February 2005, Keith Wyness stated that the club had begun to look for other potential investors. In April 2005, Samuelson stated that &quot;the Fund is completed and registered&quot; but Everton director Paul Gregg publicly questioned the FSF: &quot;As a director I have not received any proof of funds – or that they even exist.&quot; The &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; described the FSF situation as a &quot;farce&quot;. Paul Gregg stated that he had been &quot;led down the garden path and that the whole exercise has embarrassed the club.&quot; Samuelson re-iterated that funds were ready; &quot;The fund is approved and ready to go. I have not received the actual certificate of incorporation of the fund but that is a technicality.&quot; He stated that an EGM was necessary to confirm the FSF fund. &quot;As far as I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;s a fait accompli – subject to the approval of an EGM of shareholders.&quot; An EGM was never called and the question of investment into Everton from the FSF fell away from the public eye.

In November 2005, at the following AGM. Kenwright said that Samuelson &quot;was someone who I believed could have come up with the money, he had his credentials and thought he could come up with a deal that was good for the club ... but he didn&#x27;t, like many many other people, come up with the goods.&quot; He added: &quot;I am spending 24 hours a day trying to raise finance for this club. I had a meeting today, three yesterday, all involving money that would dilute my shareholding – but I&#x27;m not interested in that.&quot;

====2004 Extraordinary General Meeting====
By September 2004, concerns amongst fans had grown about the future of the club. An Extraordinary General Meeting was called by shareholders; &quot;The shareholders of the Company express their deep concern at the current state of affairs in the Company&quot;. It called for the board of directors to resign if they did not address previous motions to the satisfaction of shareholders Kenwright is considered approachable by fans and prior to the EGM he contacted a fan website before the press regarding the meeting.

====2008 Extraordinary General Meeting====
In 2007, Kenwright said in an interview on ITV that Goodison Park would soon fail to obtain a ground safety certificate and announced that he would like to move the club to Kirkby as part of a proposal known as Destination Kirkby which included a Tesco supermarket and a retail park. The pursuit of this project led to minor shareholders of the club calling for an Extraordinary General Meeting in 2008. After it was confirmed that the EGM would go ahead, Keith Wyness resigned and was replaced by Robert Elstone who was promoted to the position from within.

At this meeting, Kenwright revealed that he took business advice from retail industry leaders Sir Philip Green and Sir Terry Leahy. The minority shareholders determined that the club should not pursue the project due to a growing number of concerns. However, Kenwright and the other majority shareholders, using one share one vote forced the resolution to be defeated and the project to proceed. The project was called in by the Secretary for State and a public inquiry determined that the project should not proceed after hearing evidence from groups who opposed the scheme such as Keep Everton In Our City (KEIOC).

In April 2008, he agreed to produce &quot;Dixie: The People&#x27;s Legend&quot;, a documentary on Everton legend Dixie Dean produced by Liverpool-based company Tabacula.

==Personal life==
Kenwright was married to actress Anouska Hempel from 1978 to 1980 and had a daughter and two grandchildren from his relationship with the actress Virginia Stride. Until Kenwright’s death in 2023, he was in a long-term relationship with the actress Jenny Seagrove, with the couple residing in London. The West End theatre publicist Adam Kenwright is his nephew who runs advertising and marketing company aka.

===Death===
Everton provided a short update on Kenwright&#x27;s health on 12 October 2023 saying in a statement: &quot;Following a diagnosis at the beginning of August, Mr Kenwright underwent a major medical procedure six weeks ago to remove a cancerous tumour from his liver. The procedure was completely successful, but complications during surgery necessitated a prolonged period in an intensive care unit.&quot; Everton further went on to say: &quot;his recovery which is expected to be lengthy, but complete.&quot; Kenwright died of liver cancer on 23 October 2023, at the age of 78.

Following publication of his obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, one reader posted the following anecdote underneath: “I haven’t met Bill Kenwright since we were in the National Youth Theatre together in about 1963. His broad Merseyside accent caused such amusement that my vivid memory during our production of &quot;Richard III&quot; at the long-gone Scala Theatre, was of the cast waiting for his line as Third Messenger, either over the intercom or our crowding into the wings to catch it. Hard to do phonetic justice in print to his flat-vowelled news that ‘By sudd’n fludds, Buckin-gum’s ahhmee is dispehhhrsed ‘n’ scatta’d’.”

On 26 October 2023, theatres across the UK dimmed their lights for two minutes to mark Kenwrights&#x27;s passing.

==Honours==
Kenwright received an Honorary Fellowship from Liverpool&#x27;s John Moores University and was an Honorary Professor of University of West London in London.

Kenwright was awarded the CBE for his services to film and theatre in the 2001 New Year Honours.

In November 2008 he was awarded an Honorary degree of Doctor of Letters (D.Litt.) from Nottingham Trent University in recognition of his outstanding contribution and commitment to British theatre.

On 3 January 2014, Kenwright appeared on the BBC show &quot;Pointless Celebrities&quot;. He and his partner Jenny Seagrove reached the final and won the Pointless trophy, but gave three incorrect answers and missed out on the £2,500 jackpot.

<doc id="732403" wikidata="Q21103279" url="?curid=732403" title="Perforin-1">
<text>Perforin-1 Perforin (PRF), encoded by the PRF1 gene, is a pore-forming toxic protein housed in the secretory granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells. Together, these cells are known as cytotoxic lymphocytes (CLs). 

== Discovery ==
Perforin was initially discovered in 1983 and subsequently cloned from an expression library in 1988 using anti-complement C9 antibody cross-reactivity. A sequence comparison showed a notable resemblance between the two proteins in a specific central region, termed the &#x27;membrane attack complex/perforin&#x27; (MACPF) domain. 

==Structure and Function==
Purifying perforin is challenging due to its tendency to lose activity and stability in solution, and only recently has a recombinant form been successfully produced.

Perforin is a pore forming cytolytic protein found in the granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer cells (NK cells). Upon degranulation, perforin molecules translocate to the target cell with the help of calreticulin, which works as a chaperone protein to prevent perforin from degrading. Perforin then binds to the target cell&#x27;s plasma membrane via membrane phospholipids while phosphatidylcholine binds calcium ions to increase perforin&#x27;s affinity to the membrane. Perforin oligomerises in a Ca2+ dependent manner to form pores on the target cell. The pore formed allows for the passive diffusion of a family of pro-apoptotic proteases, known as the granzymes, into the target cell. The lytic membrane-inserting part of perforin is the MACPF domain. This region shares homology with cholesterol-dependent cytolysins from Gram-positive bacteria.

The initial concept of a plasma membrane pore model was challenged when research revealed that granzyme B could undergo endocytosis independently of perforin. Moreover, experiments demonstrated that apoptosis could be induced by adding perforin to washed cells that had already endocytosed granzyme B, even in the absence of perforin during the endocytosis process. In light of these findings, Froelich and colleagues suggested that perforin&#x27;s action might not occur at the plasma membrane as previously thought, but rather at the endosomal membrane. They proposed that perforin likely facilitates the release of granzymes from endosomes by forming pores in the endosomal membrane.

Perforin has structural and functional similarities to complement component 9 (C9). Like C9, this protein creates transmembrane tubules and is capable of lysing non-specifically a variety of target cells. This protein is one of the main cytolytic proteins of cytolytic granules, and it is known to be a key effector molecule for T-cell- and natural killer-cell-mediated cytolysis. Perforin is thought to act by creating holes in the plasma membrane which triggers an influx of calcium and initiates membrane repair mechanisms. These repair mechanisms bring perforin and granzymes into early endosomes.

== Clinical Significance ==

=== &quot;Acute&quot; presentations of perforinopathy — FHL ===
Around the turn of the 21st century, it was recognized that a total loss of perforin activity leads to a severe, fatal autosomal recessive immunoregulatory disorder in infants, known as familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL), typically appearing before 12 months of age. This condition can only be treated effectively with a bone marrow transplant from a non-related donor. 

The pathogenesis involves a sequence of downstream events resulting from the inability of NK cells and CTLs to present functional perforin, thereby failing to kill target cells. Infants affected by this condition typically show symptoms of &quot;classic&quot; familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) and meet most or all of the criteria outlined in HLH-2004. Diagnosis is confirmed by reduced NK cell cytotoxicity, as healthy NK cells normally exhibit constitutive, pathogen-independent cytotoxicity, and by identifying mutations in genes such as PRF1, UNC13D, STX11, and STXBP2.

=== &quot;Sub-acute&quot; presentations of perforinopathy ===
Sub-acute perforinopathies encompass a diverse array of symptoms, all stemming from a partial (&quot;sub-total&quot;) reduction in cytotoxic lymphocyte (CL) activity due to bi-allelic mutations in one of the four previously mentioned genes. In contrast to the acute form, diagnosing sub-acute perforinopathies can be challenging due to their typically milder and more sporadic clinical manifestations, an intermittent disease course, variability in onset age, and their frequent positive response to non-specific immune-suppressive or immune-ablative treatments.

=== &quot;Chronic&quot; presentations of perforinopathy ===
Chronic perforinopathies are regarded as a range of immune-related conditions resulting from monoallelic mutations in genes linked to familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL). These conditions typically manifest differently from classic FHL and may include conditions like blood cancers and macrophage activation syndrome, particularly in patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Onset of symptoms usually occurs after the age of 5. Moreover, some research suggests a correlation between variations in the PRF1 gene and the outcome of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. However, these associations remain controversial, with studies disproving the connection outweighing those supporting it.

==Interactions==
Perforin has been shown to interact with calreticulin.

<text>Neuroactive is a Synthpop, Futurepop, EBM music group from Finland founded by Jarkko Tuohimaa, Ville Brusi, and Vesa Rainne.

== History ==
Neuroactive was formed in 1991 by Jarkko Tuohimaa (after he left the band Advanced Art), Ville Brusi, and Vesa Rainne. After signing with Cyberware Productions, their first album, &quot;Morphology&quot;, was released in 1994 and followed by &quot;Phonic Trace&quot; in 1997. Shortly thereafter, Brusi and Rainne left the group, and Kimmo Karjalainen came on board to sing for the next two albums, &quot;Fiber Optic Rhythm&quot; and &quot;Transients&quot;. &quot;Fiber Optic Rhythm&quot; also featured Geoff Pickney of The Nine on guest vocals.
&quot;Fiber Optic Rhythm&quot; was a huge breakthrough for Neuroactive, and they gained new fans worldwide. The album&#x27;s popularity also attracted the attention of U.S. Synthpop record label A Different Drum who signed them in 1998. Neuroactive continued to release material under that label until its closing in 2014, including &quot;Transients&quot; in 2001, &quot;N-Gin&quot; in 2005, &quot;Antidote&quot; in 2009, and &quot;Electra&quot; in 2014.

After &quot;Transients&quot;, life and family obligations took energy away from the band leading vocalist Kimmo Karjalainen to depart and eventually begin his own project, Huminoida. The albums &quot;N-Gin&quot; and &quot;Antidote&quot; both included several guest singers, including Christopher Anton (Information Society), Kirk Taylor (The Dignity of Labour), Marcus Fellechner (Rename), and Albert Martinez (Neuropa) among others. &quot;Electra&quot; features all female vocals by Sonja Myers. 

After a six year hiatus, Neuroactive returned with a new single, &quot;Night Flights&quot;, on the Belgian label Alfa Matrix. Tuohimaa then brought back former members Karjalainen and Rainne to release a full-length album &quot;Minor Side-Effects&quot; and subsequent singles for &quot;Dances&quot; and &quot;In Rust We Trust&quot;. &quot;Minor Side Effects&quot; also features two songs with guest vocals by John Peverieri of Halo Effect.

Neuroactive has remixed numerous bands over their career including: Aïboforcen, Aghast View, Iris, B! Machine, Neuropa, The Nine, T.O.Y., and Assemblage 23.

<doc id="732412" wikidata="Q155238" url="?curid=732412" title="53 Kalypso">
<text>53 Kalypso is a large and very dark main belt asteroid that was discovered by German astronomer Robert Luther on April 4, 1858, at Düsseldorf. It is named after Calypso, a sea nymph in Greek mythology, a name it shares with Calypso, a moon of Saturn.

The orbit of 53 Kalypso places it in a mean motion resonance with the planets Jupiter and Saturn. The computed Lyapunov time for this asteroid is 19,000 years, indicating that it occupies a chaotic orbit that will change randomly over time because of gravitational perturbations of the planets.

Photometric observations of this asteroid during 2005–06 gave a light curve with a period of 18.075 ± 0.005 hours and a brightness variation of 0.14 in magnitude. In 2009, a photometric study from a different viewing angle was performed at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico, yielding a rotation period of 9.036 ± 0.001 with a brightness variation of 0.14 ± 0.02 magnitude. This is exactly half of the 2005–06 result. The author of the earlier study used additional data observation that favored the 9.036 hour period. The discrepancy was deemed a consequence of viewing the asteroid from different longitudes.

Kalypso has been studied by radar.

<text>Alexander Henry Scrymgeour, 12th Earl of Dundee, (born 5 June 1949), is a Scottish peer, Conservative politician and Chief of the Clan Scrymgeour.

Born on 5 June 1949, Dundee is the son of Henry Scrymgeour-Wedderburn, 11th Earl of Dundee, and Patricia Montagu Douglas Scott. He was educated at Ludgrove School and Eton College before attending the University of St Andrews. He was a Page of Honour to Queen Elizabeth II.

Lord Scrymgeour&#x27;s first active experience as a Conservative politician was as the party&#x27;s candidate in the Hamilton by-election in 1978. He has sat in the House of Lords since his father&#x27;s death in 1983, and served as a Lord-in-waiting (Conservative Party whip in the House of Lords) from 1986 to 1989. He served as Government Spokesperson for Education (1986–1988), Government Spokesperson for Scottish Affairs (1986–1989), Government Spokesperson for Home Affairs and for Energy from (1987–1989). He was made an elected hereditary peer (as Earl of Dundee) in 1999.

He has served as the UK delegate to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe from 1992 to 1997. He was also a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the Western European parliament from 1992 to 1999. The Earl is honorary consul for Croatia in Edinburgh, and is decorated with the Order of Prince Branimir. The Dundee Trust works on the Dalmatian coast in Croatia on behalf of DFID to distribute humanitarian aid to some of the poorest people in the Balkans.

A farmer of thirty years&#x27; experience, Lord Dundee&#x27;s Farming Company manages some 2000 acres over the counties of Fife and Angus. Dundee has sat in the House since 1983 where he has exercised his privileges on a number of agriculture and environmental standing committees. Most recently his interests have turned to health questions.

Lord Dundee is also the Hereditary Royal Standard Bearer of Scotland, Constable of Dundee, and Chief of the Name and Arms of Scrymgeour. He was one of the peers carrying the Royal Standards at the 2023 Coronation. 

He is a member of the New Club, Edinburgh and Whites, in London.

==Family==
Lord Dundee married Siobhan Mary (died 11 March 2019), daughter of David Llewellyn of 41 Cleveland Square, London, and Great Somerford, Wiltshire, on 19 July 1979. They have four children:

*Lady Marina Patricia Scrymgeour (born 21 August 1980)
*Henry David Scrymgeour-Wedderburn, Viscount Dudhope (born 20 June 1982).
*Lady Flora Hermione Vera Scrymgeour (born 3 November 1985).
*Lady Lavinia Rebecca Elizabeth Scrymgeour (born 1986).

<text>Give Me the Brain is a discard-style card game designed by James Ernest and released in 1996 by Cheapass Games. In the game, players assume the role of zombies attempting to complete their tasks for the day at Friedey&#x27;s, &quot;the fast food restaurant of the damned&quot;, yet they only have one brain to share between them.
The game inspired several sequels, all set at Friedey&#x27;s.

The original edition was the recipient of an Origins Award for &quot;Best Traditional Card Game of 1997&quot;. A Czech-language version of the original game was released in 1997 with the name &quot;Dej sem mozek&quot;. An expanded Special Edition was released in 2002, and was nominated in the same category for the 2003 Origins Awards.

Just as Steve Jackson Games re-released Lord of the Fries in 2008, it was revealed at PAX 2010 that a third edition of Give Me the Brain would be released in the same manner.

== Game play ==

Each player receives a hand of cards at the start of the game; the objective of &quot;Give Me the Brain&quot; is to play all cards in your hand, which corresponds to your zombie completing all the work assigned for the day. Each card is labeled with zero, one, or two hand icons; when it&#x27;s your turn, you can play any number of cards, provided that together they show a total of no more than two hands.

Every card has some special effect on the game, and this must be dealt with whenever a card is played.

Some cards, indicated by a brain icon, require your zombie to have the brain in order to play. The brain is represented by a token that is held by one player at a time. The brain can be obtained by a number of methods: most commonly, many of the special effects written on cards will change which player has the brain. At the start of the game, a &quot;Brain Auction&quot; occurs to decide which player will have the brain to start with: in a Brain Auction, players must play Brain Bid cards from their hands to bid on the brain, and the highest bidder receives it. A player who holds no Brain Bid cards is not eligible to receive the brain, but holding Brain Bid cards can be a bad thing as well, as described below.

Every card which carries the brain icon also has a number printed just below it. After playing a card which features the brain, the player must roll a 6-sided die; if the result is less than the number shown on the card, the zombie has still completed the task but has managed to drop the brain in the process, triggering another Brain Auction. Since Brain Bid cards are cards in your hand, it is necessary to play all the ones you have in order to win: but since they can only be played during Brain Auctions, it may be necessary for a player to deliberately trigger Brain Auctions – or even to bid against themselves – in order to win.

<doc id="732438" wikidata="Q415343" url="?curid=732438" title="Etanercept">
<text>Etanercept, sold under the brand name Enbrel among others, is a biologic medical product that is used to treat autoimmune diseases by interfering with tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a soluble inflammatory cytokine, by acting as a TNF inhibitor. It has US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to treat rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is the &quot;master regulator&quot; of the inflammatory (immune) response in many organ systems. Autoimmune diseases are caused by an overactive immune response. Etanercept has the potential to treat these diseases by inhibiting TNF-alpha.

Etanercept is a fusion protein produced by recombinant DNA. It fuses the TNF receptor to the constant end of the IgG1 antibody. First, the developers isolated the DNA sequence that codes the human gene for soluble TNF receptor 2, which is a receptor that binds to tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Second, they isolated the DNA sequence that codes the human gene for the Fc end of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). Third, they linked the DNA for TNF receptor 2 to the DNA for IgG1 Fc. Finally, they expressed the linked DNA to produce a protein that links the protein for TNF receptor 2 to the protein for IgG1 Fc.

The prototypic fusion protein was first synthesized and shown to be highly active and unusually stable as a modality for blockade of TNF &quot;in vivo&quot; in the early 1990s by Bruce A. Beutler, an academic researcher then at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, and his colleagues.

These investigators also patented the protein, selling all rights to its use to Immunex, a Seattle biotechnology company that was acquired by Amgen in 2002.

It is a large molecule, with a molecular weight of 150 kDa, that binds to TNFα and decreases its role in disorders involving excess inflammation in humans and other animals, including autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and, potentially, in a variety of other disorders mediated by excess TNFα. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

==Medical uses==
In the United States, etanercept is indicated for:
* Moderate to Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) (Nov 1998)
* Moderate to Severe Polyarticular Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (May 1999)
* Psoriatic Arthritis (Jan 2002)
* Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) (July 2003)
* Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis (April 2004)

In the European Union, etanercept is indicated to treat:
* moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis
* severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis
* juvenile idiopathic arthritis
* polyarthritis (rheumatoid-factor-positive or -negative) and extended oligoarthritis in children and adolescents
* active and progressive psoriatic arthritis
* enthesitis-related arthritis
* axial spondyloarthritis
* severe active ankylosing spondylitis
* severe non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis
* moderate to severe plaque psoriasis
* chronic severe plaque psoriasis pediatric plaque psoriasis

=== Unrecognized uses ===

An American physician, Edward Tobinick, has attempted to use etanercept to treat chronic neurological dysfunction after stroke and brain injury and issued U.S. and foreign patents. Writing for Science-Based Medicine, Steven Novella said that it was &quot;unethical for physicians to practice outside of their area of competence and expertise&quot;. Tobinick sued Novella in response, and lost. Of this treatment, the American Academy of Neurology advise &quot;there is insufficient evidence to determine its effectiveness and that the treatment may be associated with adverse outcomes and high cost&quot;.

== Adverse effects ==

On 2 May 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed a black box warning on etanercept due to a number of serious infections associated with the drug. Serious infections and sepsis, including fatalities, have been reported with the use of etanercept including reactivation of latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B infections.

Injection site reactions such as redness and pain are common, occurring in approximately 11.4% of cases.

== Mechanism of action ==
Etanercept reduces the effect of naturally present TNF, and hence is a TNF inhibitor, functioning as a decoy receptor that binds to TNF.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) is a cytokine produced by lymphocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cells. It mediates the immune response by attracting additional white blood cells to sites of inflammation and through additional molecular mechanisms that initiate and amplify inflammation. Inhibition of its action by etanercept reduces the inflammatory response, which is especially useful for treating autoimmune diseases.

There are two types of TNF receptors: those found embedded in white blood cells that respond to TNF by releasing other cytokines, and &quot;soluble&quot; TNF receptors that are used to deactivate TNF and blunt the immune response. In addition, TNF receptors are found on the surface of virtually all nucleated cells (red blood cells, which are not nucleated, do not contain TNF receptors on their surface). Etanercept mimics the inhibitory effects of naturally occurring soluble TNF receptors, the difference being that etanercept, because it is a fusion protein rather than a simple TNF receptor, has a greatly extended half-life in the bloodstream, and therefore a more profound and long-lasting biologic effect than a naturally occurring soluble TNF receptor.

== Structure ==
Etanercept is made from the combination of two naturally occurring soluble human 75-kilodalton TNF receptors linked to an Fc portion of an IgG1. The effect is an artificially engineered dimeric fusion protein. Etanercept is a complex molecule containing 6 N-glycans, up to 14 O-glycans and 29 disulfide bridge structures.

==History==
The first etanercept-related patent was filed by Immunex in September 1989. The fusion protein was developed by Bruce A. Beutler, an academic researcher then at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, and colleagues, who patented it and licensed the rights in 1995 to Immunex. Another patent on such fusion protein technology from Brian Seed at Massachusetts General Hospital was licensed to Immmunex in 1997.

Etanercept was approved for use in the United States in November 1998.

Etanercept was approved for use in the European Union in February 2000.

==Society and culture==

===Economics===
The US retail price of etanercept has risen over time. In 2008, the cost of etanercept was $1,500 per month or $18,000 per year. By 2011, the cost had exceeded $20,000 per year. In 2013, a survey by the International Federation of Health Plans (IFHP) found that the average US cost for etanercept was $2,225 per month, or $26,700 per year. The IFHP report also found wide variation in prices charged to various US health plans, between $1,946 per month at the 25th percentile and $4,006 per month at the 95th percentile.

Etanercept is more expensive in the US than in other countries. As of 2013, average monthly costs in surveyed nations ranged from $1,017 in Switzerland to $1,646 in Canada, compared to an average monthly cost of $2,225 per month in the US.

Amgen sells etanercept within the US and Canada, while Pfizer, Inc. sells the drug outside of the US and Canada. Sales within the US and Canada were $3.5 billion in 2010. Sales of etanercept outside the US and Canada were $3.3 billion in 2010.

===Patents===
The patent on etanercept was set to expire in October 2012, but, in the United States, a second patent, granting exclusivity for another 16 years, has been granted.

Before the extension it seemed unlikely that a generic would have been available. As a biologic, etanercept is subject to different laws from those applicable to chemical formulations. Many countries do not permit the manufacture of generic biologics. However, the European Union and the United States (Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009) do have in place a system to approve generic biologics (biosimilars) which &quot;requires mandatory clinical testing and periodic review&quot;.

In April 2013, the Indian pharma major Cipla made an announcement about launching the first biosimilar of Etanercept in India under the brand name Etacept for the treatment of rheumatic disorders.

===Biosimilars===
In January 2016, Benepali was approved for use in the European Union.

In February 2017, Lifmior was approved for use in the European Union. It was withdrawn from the market in February 2020.

In June 2017, Erelzi was approved for use in the European Union.

In March 2019, YLB113 (Etanercept biosimilar by YL Biologics) was approved in Japan.

In April 2019, Eticovo received FDA approval.

In May 2020, Nepexto was approved for use in the European Union.

Rymti and Etera were approved for medical use in Australia in October 2020.

<text>Henry Canova Vollam Morton (known as H. V. Morton), (26 July 1892 – 18 June 1979) was a journalist and pioneering travel writer from Lancashire, England. He was best known for his many books on London, Great Britain and the Holy Land. He first achieved fame in 1923 when, while working for the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, he covered the opening of the tomb of Tutankhamun by Howard Carter.

==Life==
===Early life===
Morton was born at Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, on 26 July 1892, the son of Joseph Morton, editor of the &quot;Birmingham Mail&quot;, and Margaret Maclean Ewart. He was educated at King Edward&#x27;s School in Birmingham but left at the age of 16 to pursue a career in journalism. He served in the Warwickshire Yeomanry during World War I, but saw no combat action. He married Dorothy Vaughton (born 1887) on 14 September 1915. They had three children, Michael, Barbara and John. They later divorced, and on 4 January 1934, he married Violet Mary Muskett (née Greig, born 1900, known as Mary). They had a son, Timothy.

===Later life===
In the late 1940s Morton, and Violet, immigrated to the Union of South Africa, settling near Cape Town in Somerset West. He later became a South African citizen, and remained a permanent resident until his death in 1979. Morton and his son were survived by Mary.

==Journalism==
Morton&#x27;s journalism career began in 1910 at the &quot;Birmingham Gazette and Express&quot;, where his father was an editor. Two years later, he was promoted to an assistant editor; and relocated to London for most of his British career. His first position in London was as a sub-editor for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;.

After his military service during First World War, he returned to London, working at the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; in 1919–21, and from 1921 on the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. His columns on London life in the latter were popular among readers.

Morton also gave readings of his work on BBC Radio.

===Tomb of Tutankhamun===

In 1923 the &quot;Daily Express&quot; sent Morton to Egypt to cover the excavation of Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb. Morton was able to provide an eye witness account of the opening of the inner burial chamber containing the sarcophagus of Tutankhamun, circumventing &quot;The Times&quot; exclusive rights to the story. A day after the opening, the discovery was reported in the &quot;Daily Express&quot;:

His widely-read articles on the excavation helped establish Morton&#x27;s reputation as a journalist and were a boon to the popularity of his travel writing and journalism. Between 1931 and 1942, he was &quot;special writer&quot; at the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;. In 1941, he was a reporter at the Atlantic Charter between Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt, which later became the subject of his book &quot;Atlantic Meeting&quot;, published 1943.

==Travel writing==
Morton&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Heart of London&quot;, appeared in 1925, which developed his popular &quot;Daily Express&quot; columns. This was followed by two further collections of his writings on London, in &quot;The Spell of London&quot; (1926), and &quot;Nights of London&quot; (1926). In 1926 he wrote a series of articles for the &quot;Daily Express&quot; based on his travels around England in his bull-nosed Morris car. The series was entitled &quot;In Search of England&quot; and the vignettes were later adapted into the book of the same name. This became a bestseller and the first of his many &quot;In Search of...&quot; books.

Morton&#x27;s first foreign travel book, &quot;In the Steps of the Master&quot; (1934), was well received and sold over half a million copies. The Master of the title was Jesus, and the book was an account of Morton&#x27;s travels in the Holy Land. This was soon followed by &quot;In the Steps of St. Paul&quot; (1936), and describes Turkey 13 years after the Turkish War of Independence and its founding as a modern state. This was followed by &quot;Through Lands of the Bible&quot; (1938) in which he visits Egypt, Palestine, Syria and Iraq. Extracts from all three books were combined and published as &quot;Middle East&quot; during World War II for British servicemen stationed in the Middle East.

In addition to &quot;Atlantic Meeting&quot; (1941), Morton wrote two books describing England and the War, including collection of essays on London in &quot; The Ghosts of London&quot; (1939), &quot;I Saw Two Englands&quot; (1942), and &quot;I, James Blunt&quot; describing England after the Nazi victory, being fictional propaganda for the British Government. A full-length history of London, (&quot;In Search of London&quot;) (1951), includes a post-war examination of bombing damage inflicted on London during The Blitz. After the war, South Africa was the subject of &quot;In Search of South Africa&quot; (1948), and shortly afterwards he and his wife immigrated there. During the mid-1950s and 60s he wrote books on Spain and Italy. &quot;A Traveller in Italy&quot; is situated in Northern Italy, while &quot;A Traveller in Southern Italy&quot; explores the poorer provinces of the south.

==Honours==
Morton became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (FRSL). Greece made him a Commander of the Order of the Phoenix in 1937 and he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in 1965. A commemorative blue plaque was erected in Ashton-under-Lyne (Morton&#x27;s birthplace) in June 2004.

==Controversy==
A controversial biography by Michael Bartholomew, based on Morton&#x27;s private and public writings, titled &quot;In Search of H. V. Morton&quot;, was published by Methuen in 2004. According to Bartholomew, based on Morton&#x27;s private memoirs and diaries, Morton was privately a Nazi sympathizer. In a diary entry from February 1941, he confessed: &quot;I must say Nazi-ism has some fine qualities&quot; and, &quot;I am appalled to discover how many of Hitler&#x27;s theories appeal to me&quot;. In another entry, he described the United States as &quot;that craven nation of Jews and foreigners&quot;.

==Publications==
Morton was a prolific writer, with a body of work consisting of several hundred newspaper, magazine articles and features, in addition to his published books.

<doc id="732444" wikidata="Q251005" url="?curid=732444" title="Nystatin">
<text>Nystatin, sold under the brand name Mycostatin among others, is an antifungal medication. It is used to treat &quot;Candida&quot; infections of the skin including diaper rash, thrush, esophageal candidiasis, and vaginal yeast infections. It may also be used to prevent candidiasis in those who are at high risk. Nystatin may be used by mouth, in the vagina, or applied to the skin.
Common side effects when applied to the skin include burning, itching, and a rash. Common side effects when taken by mouth include vomiting and diarrhea. During pregnancy use in the vagina is safe while other formulations have not been studied in this group. It works by disrupting the cell membrane of the fungal cells.
Nystatin was discovered in 1950 by Rachel Fuller Brown and Elizabeth Lee Hazen. It was the first polyene macrolide antifungal. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. It is made from the bacterium &quot;Streptomyces noursei&quot;. In 2022, it was the 236th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

== Medical uses ==
Skin, vaginal, mouth, and esophageal &quot;Candida&quot; infections usually respond well to treatment with nystatin. Infections of nails or hyperkeratinized skin do not respond well.

When given parenterally, its activity is reduced due to presence of plasma.

Oral nystatin is often used as a preventive treatment in people who are at risk for fungal infections, such as AIDS patients with a low CD4+ count and people receiving chemotherapy. It has been investigated for use in patients after liver transplantation, but fluconazole was found to be much more effective for preventing colonization, invasive infection, and death. It is effective in treating oral candidiasis in elderly people who wear dentures.

It is also used in very low birth-weight (less than 1500 g or 3 lb 5oz o) infants to prevent invasive fungal infections, although fluconazole is the preferred treatment. It has been found to reduce the rate of invasive fungal infections and also reduce deaths when used in these babies.

Liposomal nystatin is not commercially available, but investigational use has shown greater &quot;in vitro&quot; activity than colloidal formulations of amphotericin B, and demonstrated effectiveness against some amphotericin B-resistant forms of fungi. It offers an intriguing possibility for difficult-to-treat systemic infections, such as invasive aspergillosis, or infections that demonstrate resistance to amphotericin B. &quot;Cryptococcus&quot; is also sensitive to nystatin. Additionally, liposomal nystatin appears to cause fewer cases of and less severe nephrotoxicity than observed with amphotericin B. 

==Adverse effects==
Bitter taste and nausea are more common than most other adverse effects.

The oral suspension form produces a number of adverse effects including but not limited to:

# Diarrhea
# Abdominal pain
# Rarely, tachycardia, bronchospasm, facial swelling, muscle aches
Both the oral suspension and the topical form can cause:
# Hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens–Johnson syndrome in some cases
# Rash, itching, burning and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis
Too high of a dosage can potentially lead to additional side effects such as:

# Nephrotoxicity
# Hypokalemia
# Chills and skin rash

==Mechanism of action==
Like amphotericin B and natamycin, nystatin is an ionophore. It binds to ergosterol, a major component of the fungal cell membrane. When present in sufficient concentrations, it forms pores in the membrane that lead to K+ leakage, acidification, and death of the fungus. Ergosterol is a sterol unique to fungi, so the drug does not have such catastrophic effects on animals or plants. However, many of the systemic/toxic effects of nystatin in humans are attributable to its binding to mammalian sterols, namely cholesterol. This is the effect that accounts for the nephrotoxicity observed when high serum levels of nystatin are achieved. Despite the molecular similarities and differences of ergosterol and cholesterol, there is currently no consensus as to why nystatin has a higher binding affinity for ergosterol because it remains unclear how the nystatin pores are formed. Researchers have concluded thus far that nystatin pores are formed from 4-12 nystatin molecules, with an unknown number of the necessary sterol interactions.

Nystatin also impacts cell membrane potential and transport by lipid peroxidation. Conjugated double bonds in nystatin&#x27;s structure steal electron density from ergosterol in fungal cell membranes. Lipid peroxidation alters the hydrophilicity of the interior of channels in the membrane, which is necessary to transport ions and polar molecules. Disruption of membrane transport from nystatin results in rapid cell death. Lipid peroxidation by nystatin also contributes significantly to K+ leakage due to structural modifications of the membrane.

==Biosynthesis==
Nystatin A1 (often called nystatin) is biosynthesized by a bacterial strain, &quot;Streptomyces noursei&quot;. The structure of this active compound is characterized as a polyene macrolide with a deoxysugar -mycosamine, an aminoglycoside. The genomic sequence of nystatin reveals the presence of the polyketide loading module (nysA), six polyketide syntheses modules (nysB, nysC, nysI, nysJ, and nysK) and two thioesterase modules (nysK and nysE). It is evident that the biosynthesis of the macrolide functionality follows the polyketide synthase I pathway.

Following the biosynthesis of the macrolide, the compound undergoes post-synthetic modifications, which are aided by the following enzymes: GDP-mannose dehydratase (nysIII), P450 monooxygenase (nysL and nysN), aminotransferase (nysDII), and glycosyltransferase (nysDI). The biosynthetic pathway is thought to proceed as shown to yield nystatin.
The melting point of nystatin is 44 - 46 °C.

==History==

Like many other antifungals and antibiotics, nystatin has bacterial origin. It was isolated from &quot;Streptomyces noursei&quot; in 1950 by Elizabeth Lee Hazen and Rachel Fuller Brown, who were doing research for the Division of Laboratories and Research of the New York State Department of Health. Hazen found a promising micro-organism in the soil of a friend&#x27;s dairy farm. She named it &quot;Streptomyces noursei&quot;, after Jessie Nourse, the wife of the farm&#x27;s owner. Hazen and Brown named nystatin after the New York State Health Department in 1954. The two discoverers patented the drug, and then donated the $13 million in profits to a foundation to fund similar research.

== Other uses ==

It is also used in cellular biology as an inhibitor of the lipid raft-caveolae endocytosis pathway on mammalian cells, at concentrations around 3 μg/ml.

In certain cases, a nystatin derivative has been used to prevent the spread of mold on objects such as works of art. For example, it was applied to wood panel paintings damaged as a result of the Arno River Flood of 1966 in Florence, Italy.

Nystatin is also used as a tool by scientists performing &quot;perforated&quot; patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings of cells. When loaded in the recording pipette, it allows for measurement of electrical currents without washing out the intracellular contents, because it forms pores in the cell membrane that are permeable to only monovalent ions, preferably cations such as sodium, potassium, lithium, and cesium.

Another electrophysiological measurement that can be made is fusion event duration in a nystatin-ergosterol based system. Fusions are measured while the voltage is held constant, and is characterized by a spike in the current that then returns to the baseline current as the nystatin channels close. When present in smaller concentrations, nystatin momentarily forms pores that allows a vesicle fusion to occur more easily; that fusion then interrupts the pore stability and the nystatin and ergosterol disperse from each other. Conversely, researchers have found that the half-life of these nystatin pores increase with an increased dosage level of nystatin to the membrane systems. This indicates a lower energy of both the lipid membrane and the ionophores when there is a higher concentration of nystatin.

== Formulations ==
* An oral suspension form is used for the prophylaxis or treatment of oropharyngeal thrush, a superficial candidal infection of the mouth and pharynx.
* A tablet form is preferred for candidal infections in the intestines.
* Nystatin is available as a topical cream and can be used for superficial candidal infections of the skin.
* Additionally, a liposomal formulation of nystatin was investigated in the 1980s and into the early 21st century. The liposomal form was intended to resolve problems arising from the poor solubility of the parent molecule and the associated systemic toxicity of the free drug.
* Nystatin pastilles have been shown to be more effective in treating oral candidiasis than nystatin suspensions.

Due to its toxicity profile when high levels in the serum are obtained, no injectable formulations of nystatin are on the US market. However, injectable formulations have been investigated in the past.

<doc id="732446" wikidata="Q599404" url="?curid=732446" title="Lorentz factor">
<text>The Lorentz factor or Lorentz term (also known as the gamma factor) is a dimensionless quantity expressing how much the measurements of time, length, and other physical properties change for an object while it moves. The expression appears in several equations in special relativity, and it arises in derivations of the Lorentz transformations. The name originates from its earlier appearance in Lorentzian electrodynamics – named after the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz.

It is generally denoted (the Greek lowercase letter gamma). Sometimes (especially in discussion of superluminal motion) the factor is written as (Greek uppercase-gamma) rather than .

==Definition==
The Lorentz factor is defined as
formula_1
where:
* is the relative velocity between inertial reference frames,
* is the speed of light in vacuum,
* is the ratio of to ,
* is coordinate time,
* is the proper time for an observer (measuring time intervals in the observer&#x27;s own frame).

This is the most frequently used form in practice, though not the only one (see below for alternative forms).

To complement the definition, some authors define the reciprocal
formula_2
see velocity addition formula.

==Occurrence==
Following is a list of formulae from Special relativity which use as a shorthand:
* The Lorentz transformation: The simplest case is a boost in the -direction (more general forms including arbitrary directions and rotations not listed here), which describes how spacetime coordinates change from one inertial frame using coordinates to another with relative velocity : formula_3
Corollaries of the above transformations are the results:
* Time dilation: The time () between two ticks as measured in the frame in which the clock is moving, is longer than the time () between these ticks as measured in the rest frame of the clock: formula_4
* Length contraction: The length () of an object as measured in the frame in which it is moving, is shorter than its length () in its own rest frame: formula_5

Applying conservation of momentum and energy leads to these results:
* Relativistic mass: The mass of an object in motion is dependent on formula_6 and the rest mass : formula_7
* Relativistic momentum: The relativistic momentum relation takes the same form as for classical momentum, but using the above relativistic mass: formula_8
* Relativistic kinetic energy: The relativistic kinetic energy relation takes the slightly modified form: formula_9As formula_6 is a function of formula_11, the non-relativistic limit gives formula_12, as expected from Newtonian considerations.

== Numerical values ==

In the table below, the left-hand column shows speeds as different fractions of the speed of light (i.e. in units of ). The middle column shows the corresponding Lorentz factor, the final is the reciprocal. Values in bold are exact.

==Alternative representations==
There are other ways to write the factor. Above, velocity was used, but related variables such as momentum and rapidity may also be convenient.

===Momentum===
Solving the previous relativistic momentum equation for leads to
formula_13
This form is rarely used, although it does appear in the Maxwell–Jüttner distribution.

===Rapidity===
Applying the definition of rapidity as the hyperbolic angle formula_14:
formula_15
also leads to (by use of hyperbolic identities):
formula_16

Using the property of Lorentz transformation, it can be shown that rapidity is additive, a useful property that velocity does not have. Thus the rapidity parameter forms a one-parameter group, a foundation for physical models.

===Bessel function===
The Bunney identity represents the Lorentz factor in terms of an infinite series of Bessel functions:
formula_17

===Series expansion (velocity)===
The Lorentz factor has the Maclaurin series:
formula_18
which is a special case of a binomial series.

The approximation formula_19 may be used to calculate relativistic effects at low speeds. It holds to within 1% error for  &lt; 0.4  ( &lt; 120,000 km/s), and to within 0.1% error for  &lt; 0.22  ( &lt; 66,000 km/s).

The truncated versions of this series also allow physicists to prove that special relativity reduces to Newtonian mechanics at low speeds. For example, in special relativity, the following two equations hold:

formula_20

For formula_21 and formula_19, respectively, these reduce to their Newtonian equivalents:

formula_23

The Lorentz factor equation can also be inverted to yield
formula_24
This has an asymptotic form
formula_25

The first two terms are occasionally used to quickly calculate velocities from large values. The approximation formula_26 holds to within 1% tolerance for and to within 0.1% tolerance for 

==Applications in astronomy==
The standard model of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) holds that these explosions are ultra-relativistic (initial greater than approximately 100), which is invoked to explain the so-called &quot;compactness&quot; problem: absent this ultra-relativistic expansion, the ejecta would be optically thick to pair production at typical peak spectral energies of a few 100 keV, whereas the prompt emission is observed to be non-thermal.

Muons, a subatomic particle, travel at a speed such that they have a relatively high Lorentz factor and therefore experience extreme time dilation. Since muons have a mean lifetime of just 2.2 μs, muons generated from cosmic-ray collisions high in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere should be nondetectable on the ground due to their decay rate. However, roughly 10% of muons from these collisions are still detectable on the surface, thereby demonstrating the effects of time dilation on their decay rate.

<doc id="732448" wikidata="Q412223" url="?curid=732448" title="Amphotericin B">
<text>Amphotericin B is an antifungal medication used for serious fungal infections and leishmaniasis. The fungal infections it is used to treat include mucormycosis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, and cryptococcosis. For certain infections it is given with flucytosine. It is typically given intravenously.
Common side effects include a reaction with fever, chills, and headaches soon after the medication is given, as well as kidney problems. Allergic symptoms including anaphylaxis may occur. Other serious side effects include low blood potassium and myocarditis (inflammation of the heart). It appears to be relatively safe in pregnancy. There is a lipid formulation that has a lower risk of side effects. It is in the polyene class of medications and works in part by interfering with the cell membrane of the fungus.
Amphotericin B was isolated from &quot;Streptomyces nodosus&quot; in 1955 at the Squibb Institute for Medical Research from cultures isolated from the &quot;streptomycete&quot; obtained from the river bed of Orinoco in that region of Venezuela and came into medical use in 1958. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.

== Medical uses ==

=== Antifungal ===
One of the main uses of amphotericin B is treating a wide range of systemic fungal infections. Due to its extensive side effects, it is often reserved for severe infections in critically ill, or immunocompromised patients. It is considered first line therapy for invasive mucormycosis infections, cryptococcal meningitis, and certain aspergillus and candidal infections. It has been a highly effective drug for over fifty years in large part because it has a low incidence of drug resistance in the pathogens it treats. This is because amphotericin B resistance requires sacrifices on the part of the pathogen that make it susceptible to the host environment, and too weak to cause infection.

=== Antiprotozoal ===
Amphotericin B is used for life-threatening protozoan infections such as visceral leishmaniasis and primary amoebic meningoencephalitis.

===Spectrum of susceptibility===
The following table shows the amphotericin B susceptibility for a selection of medically important fungi.
== Available formulations ==

=== Intravenous ===
Amphotericin B alone is insoluble in normal saline at a pH of 7. Therefore, several formulations have been devised to improve its intravenous bioavailability. Lipid-based formulations of amphotericin B are no more effective than conventional formulations, although there is some evidence that lipid-based formulations may be better tolerated by patients and may have fewer adverse effects.

==== Deoxycholate ====
The original formulation uses sodium deoxycholate to improve solubility. Amphotericin B deoxycholate (ABD) is administered intravenously. As the original formulation of amphotericin, it is often referred to as &quot;conventional&quot; amphotericin.

==== Liposomal ====
In order to improve the tolerability of amphotericin and reduce toxicity, several lipid formulations have been developed. Liposomal formulations have been found to have less renal toxicity than deoxycholate, and fewer infusion-related reactions. They are more expensive than amphotericin B deoxycholate.

AmBisome (liposomal amphotericin B; LAMB) is a liposomal formulation of amphotericin B for injection and consists of a mixture of phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and distearoyl phosphatidylglycerol that in aqueous media spontaneously arrange into unilamellar vesicles that contain amphotericin B. It was developed by NeXstar Pharmaceuticals (acquired by Gilead Sciences in 1999). It was approved by the FDA in 1997. It is marketed by Gilead in Europe and licensed to Astellas Pharma (formerly Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals) for marketing in the US, and Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals in Japan.

==== Lipid complex formulations ====
A number of lipid complex preparations are also available. Abelcet was approved by the FDA in 1995. It consists of amphotericin B and two lipids in a 1:1 ratio that form large ribbon-like structures. Amphotec is a complex of amphotericin and sodium cholesteryl sulfate in a 1:1 ratio. Two molecules of each form a tetramer that aggregate into spiral arms on a disk-like complex. It was approved by the FDA in 1996.

===By mouth===
An oral preparation exists but is not widely available. The amphipathic nature of amphotericin along with its low solubility and permeability has posed major hurdles for oral administration given its low bioavailability. In the past it had been used for fungal infections of the surface of the GI tract such as thrush, but has been replaced by other antifungals such as nystatin and fluconazole.

However, recently novel nanoparticulate drug delivery systems such as AmbiOnp, nanosuspensions, lipid-based drug delivery systems including cochleates, self-emulsifying drug delivery systems, solid lipid nanoparticles and polymeric nanoparticles—such as amphotericin B in pegylated polylactide coglycolide copolymer nanoparticles—have demonstrated potential for oral formulation of amphotericin B. The oral lipid nanocrystal amphotericin by Matinas Biopharma is furthest along having completed a successful phase 2 clinical trial in cryptococcal meningitis.

==Side effects==
Amphotericin B is well known for its severe and potentially lethal side effects, earning it the nickname &quot;amphoterrible&quot;. Very often, it causes a serious reaction soon after infusion (within 1 to 3 hours), consisting of high fever, shaking chills, hypotension, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, headache, dyspnea and tachypnea, drowsiness, and generalized weakness. The violent chills and fevers have caused the drug to be nicknamed &quot;shake and bake&quot;. The precise etiology of the reaction is unclear, although it may involve increased prostaglandin synthesis and the release of cytokines from macrophages. Deoxycholate formulations (ABD) may also stimulate the release of histamine from mast cells and basophils. Reactions sometimes subside with later applications of the drug. This nearly universal febrile response necessitates a critical (and diagnostically difficult) professional determination as to whether the onset of high fever is a novel symptom of a fast-progressing disease, or merely the effect of the drug. To decrease the likelihood and severity of the symptoms, initial doses should be low, and increased slowly. Paracetamol, pethidine, diphenhydramine, and hydrocortisone have all been used to treat or prevent the syndrome, but the prophylactic use of these drugs is often limited by the patient&#x27;s condition.

Intravenously administered amphotericin B in therapeutic doses has also been associated with multiple organ damage. Kidney damage, including Type I (distal) renal tubular acidosis, is a frequently reported side effect, and can be severe and/or irreversible. Less kidney toxicity has been reported with liposomal formulations (such as AmBisome) and it has become preferred in patients with preexisting renal injury. The integrity of the liposome is disrupted when it binds to the fungal cell wall, but is not affected by the mammalian cell membrane, so the association with liposomes decreases the exposure of the kidneys to amphotericin B, which explains its less nephrotoxic effects.

In addition, electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia are also common. In the liver, increased liver enzymes and hepatotoxicity (up to and including fulminant liver failure) are common. In the circulatory system, several forms of anemia and other blood dyscrasias (leukopenia, thrombopenia), serious cardiac arrhythmias (including ventricular fibrillation), and even frank cardiac failure have been reported. Skin reactions, including serious forms, are also possible.

The analogue AM-2-19 has been engineered to be less toxic to the kidneys.

== Interactions ==

Drug-drug interactions may occur when amphotericin B is coadministered with the following agents:
* Flucytosine: Toxicity of flucytosine is increased and allows a lower dose of amphotericin B. Amphotericin B may also facilitate entry of flucystosine into the fungal cell by interfering with the permeability of the fungal cell membrane.
* Diuretics or cisplatin: Increased renal toxicity and increased risk of hypokalemia
* Corticosteroids: Increased risk of hypokalemia
* Imidazole Antifungals: Amphotericin B may antagonize the activity of ketoconazole and miconazole. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown.
* Neuromuscular-blocking agents: Amphotericin B-induced hypokalemia may potentiate the effects of certain paralytic agents.
* Foscarnet, ganciclovir, tenofovir, adefovir: Risk of hematological and renal side effects of amphotericin B are increased
* Zidovudine: Increased risk of renal and hematological toxicity .
* Other nephrotoxic drugs (such as aminoglycosides): Increased risk of serious renal damage
* Cytostatic drugs: Increased risk of kidney damage, hypotension, and bronchospasms
* Transfusion of leukocytes: Risk of pulmonal (lung) damage occurs, space the intervals between the application of amphotericin B and the transfusion, and monitor pulmonary function

==Mechanism of action==
Amphotericin B binds with ergosterol, a component of fungal cell membranes, forming pores that cause rapid leakage of monovalent ions (K+, Na+, H+ and Cl−) and subsequent fungal cell death. This is amphotericin B&#x27;s primary effect as an antifungal agent. It has been found that the amphotericin B/ergosterol bimolecular complex that maintains these pores is stabilized by Van der Waals interactions. Researchers have found evidence that amphotericin B also causes oxidative stress within the fungal cell, but it remains unclear to what extent this oxidative damage contributes to the drug&#x27;s effectiveness. The addition of free radical scavengers or antioxidants can lead to amphotericin resistance in some species, such as &quot;Scedosporium prolificans&quot;, without affecting the cell wall.

Two amphotericins, amphotericin A and amphotericin B, are known, but only B is used clinically, because it is significantly more active &quot;in vivo&quot;. Amphotericin A is almost identical to amphotericin B (having a C=C double bond between the 27th and 28th carbons), but has little antifungal activity.

==Mechanism of toxicity==
Mammalian and fungal membranes both contain sterols, a primary membrane target for amphotericin B. Because mammalian and fungal membranes are similar in structure and composition, this is one mechanism by which amphotericin B causes cellular toxicity. Amphotericin B molecules can form pores in the host membrane as well as the fungal membrane. This impairment in membrane barrier function can have lethal effects. Ergosterol, the fungal sterol, is more sensitive to amphotericin B than cholesterol, the common mammalian sterol. Reactivity with the membrane is also sterol concentration dependent. Bacteria are not affected as their cell membranes do not usually contain sterols.

Amphotericin B administration is limited by infusion-related toxicity. This is thought to result from innate immune production of proinflammatory cytokines.

== Biosynthesis ==
The natural route to synthesis includes polyketide synthase components. The carbon chains of amphotericin B are assembled from sixteen &#x27;C2&#x27; acetate and three &#x27;C3&#x27;propionate units by polyketide syntheses (PKSs). Polyketide biosynthesis begins with the decarboxylative condensation of a dicarboxylic acid extender unit with a starter acyl unit to form a β-ketoacyl intermediate. The growing chain is constructed by a series of Claisen reactions. Within each module, the extender units are loaded onto the current ACP domain by acetyl transferase (AT). The ACP-bound elongation group reacts in a Claisen condensation with the KS-bound polyketide chain. Ketoreductase (KR), dehydratase (DH) and enoyl reductase (ER) enzymes may also be present to form alcohol, double bonds or single bonds. After cyclisation, the macrolactone core undergoes further modification by hydroxylation, methylation and glycosylation. The order of these three post-cyclization processes is unknown.

==History==
It was originally extracted from &quot;Streptomyces nodosus&quot;, a filamentous bacterium, in 1955, at the Squibb Institute for Medical Research from cultures of an undescribed streptomycete isolated from the soil collected in the Orinoco River region of Venezuela. Two antifungal substances were isolated from the soil culture, amphotericin A and amphotericin B, but B had better antifungal activity. For decades it remained the only effective therapy for invasive fungal disease until the development of the azole antifungals in the early 1980s.

Its complete stereo structure was determined in 1970 by an X-ray structure of the N-iodoacetyl derivative. The first synthesis of the compound&#x27;s naturally occurring enantiomeric form was achieved in 1987 by K. C. Nicolaou.

Amphotericin B was used to treat a patient with disseminated coccidioidomycosis who was admitted to the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital, Seattle, Washington on January 16, 1957. &quot;The course was rapidly downhill with a grim prognosis as manifested by positive blood cultures, rising complement fixation titers, and failure of the skin to react to intradermal coccidioidin. Amphotericin B was started eight weeks following the onset of his illness. Following this there was remarkable improvement both objectively and subjectively. A fourteen-month follow-up following discontinuance of the drug revealed stabilization of all laboratory studies except for a re-elevation of the complement fixation titer from 1 to 16 to 1 to 32. The patient was completely asymptomatic except for the production of sputum containing a few spherules. The clinical effect of this drug in this patient has been most encouraging and is in agreement with results obtained by others. The lasting effect of the drug seems suggested by the patient&#x27;s complete well-being after fourteen months of cessation of treatment. It is reasonable to assume that this drug will play a major part in the specific treatment of this disease.&quot; 
===Formulations===
It is a subgroup of the macrolide antibiotics, and exhibits similar structural elements. Currently, the drug is available in many forms. Either &quot;conventionally&quot; complexed with sodium deoxycholate (ABD), as a cholesteryl sulfate complex (ABCD), as a lipid complex (ABLC), and as a liposomal formulation (LAMB). The latter formulations have been developed to improve tolerability and decrease toxicity, but may show considerably different pharmacokinetic characteristics compared to conventional amphotericin B.

===Names===

Amphotericin&#x27;s name originates from the chemical&#x27;s amphoteric properties.

It is commercially known as Fungilin, Fungizone, Abelcet, AmBisome, Fungisome, Amphocil, Amphotec, and Halizon.

<text>The Articles of Capitulation of Quebec were agreed upon between Jean-Baptiste Nicolas Roch de Ramezay, King&#x27;s Lieutenant, Admiral Sir Charles Saunders, and General George Townshend on behalf of the French and British crowns during the Seven Years&#x27; War. They were signed on 18 September 1759, shortly after British victory in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham.

All 11 demands of De Ramsay were granted by the British Army: the honors of war, the protection of the civilians and their properties, the free exercise of the Roman Catholic religion, etc. Several months later, on 28 April 1760, the French Royal Army attempted to retake Quebec City, at the Battle of Sainte-Foy. Although victorious in battle, the French were unable to retake the city due to a lack of naval support. General Chevalier de Lévis lifted the siege after the French Navy was defeated at the Battle of Neuville.

Nearly a year after the Articles of Capitulation for Quebec was signed, the government of New France capitulated in Montreal on 8 September 1760 after a two-month British campaign.

<text>Veikko Aleksanteri Heiskanen (V. A. Heiskanen; also spelled Weikko Aleksanteri (or W. A.) Heiskanen; 23 July 1895 – 23 October 1971) was a Finnish geodesist and geophysicist. He was known for his refinement of George Biddell Airy and John Henry Pratt&#x27;s theories of isostasy into his own, the Heiskanen hypothesis. With Felix Andries Vening Meinesz, he wrote the textbook &quot;The Earth and its Gravity Field&quot; (1958), and in 1960 a paper by Heiskanen, &quot;The latest achievements of physical geodesy&quot; was discussed in the scientific literature. With Helmut Moritz, Heiskanen wrote the textbook &quot;Physical Geodesy&quot; (1967), which became a standard text the field of geodesy and for the study of the geoid. Heiskanen&#x27;s doctoral students include Ivan I. Mueller.

Born 23 July 1895 in Kangaslampi, Finland, he grew up on a small farm. He attended the University of Helsinki and in three years received a Candidate in Philosophy degree (some texts state he received the Master of Science degree). In 1927 he received a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the university.

The Kaarina and Weikko A. Heiskanen Fund endows the Kaarina and Weikko A. Heiskanen Award, which is awarded annually by the Ohio State University. The university hosted the &quot;Weikko A. Heiskanen Symposium in Geodesy&quot; in 2002 to celebrate that geodesy had been studied at Ohio State for 50 years.

<text>Albert William Ketèlbey (; born Ketelbey; 9 August 1875 – 26 November 1959) was an English composer, conductor and pianist, best known for his short pieces of light orchestral music. He was born in Birmingham and moved to London in 1889 to study at Trinity College of Music. After a brilliant studentship he did not pursue the classical career predicted for him, becoming musical director of the Vaudeville Theatre before gaining fame as a composer of light music and as a conductor of his own works.

For many years Ketèlbey worked for a series of music publishers, including Chappell &amp; Co and the Columbia Graphophone Company, making arrangements for smaller orchestras, a period in which he learned to write fluent and popular music. He also found great success writing music for silent films until the advent of talking films in the late 1920s.

The composer&#x27;s early works in conventional classical style were well received, but it was for his light orchestral pieces that he became best known. One of his earliest works in the genre, &quot;In a Monastery Garden&quot; (1915), sold over a million copies and brought him to widespread notice; his later musical depictions of exotic scenes caught the public imagination and established his fortune. Such works as &quot;In a Persian Market&quot; (1920), &quot;In a Chinese Temple Garden&quot; (1923), and &quot;In the Mystic Land of Egypt&quot; (1931) became best-sellers in print and on records; by the late 1920s he was Britain&#x27;s first millionaire composer. His celebrations of British scenes were equally popular: examples include &quot;Cockney Suite&quot; (1924) with its scenes of London life, and his ceremonial music for royal events. His works were frequently recorded during his heyday, and a substantial part of his output has been put on CD in more recent years.

Ketèlbey&#x27;s popularity began to wane during the Second World War and his originality also declined; many of his post-war works were re-workings of older pieces and he increasingly found his music ignored by the BBC. In 1949 he moved to the Isle of Wight, where he spent his retirement, and he died at home in obscurity. His work has been reappraised since his death; in a 2003 poll by the BBC radio programme &quot;Your Hundred Best Tunes&quot;, &quot;Bells Across the Meadows&quot; was voted the 36th most popular tune of all time. On the last night of the 2009 Proms season the orchestra performed his &quot;In a Monastery Garden&quot;, marking the fiftieth anniversary of Ketèlbey&#x27;s death—the first time his music had been included in the festival&#x27;s finale.

==Biography==
===Early life and education, 1875–95===
Albert William Ketèlbey was born on 9 August 1875 at 41 Alma Street in the Aston area of Birmingham, England. He was the second of five children of George Henry, a jewellery engraver, and his wife Sarah Ann, Aston. The grave accent was Albert&#x27;s invention: the family name was spelled without it at the time of his birth and there had been several variants of the name in the previous generations. All the children were taught a musical instrument and Ketèlbey&#x27;s brother, Harold, was later a violinist of note. Albert showed a natural talent for the piano and singing, and he subsequently became head chorister at St Silas&#x27; Church in nearby Lozells. His younger sister was the historian Doris Ketelbey.


At the age of eleven Ketèlbey joined the Birmingham and Midland Institute school of music (now the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire) where he was tutored by Dr Alfred Gaul in composition and Dr H. W. Wareing in harmony. At the age of thirteen Ketèlbey composed his first serious piece of music, &quot;Sonata for Pianoforte&quot;, which, for Tom McCanna, his biographer, &quot;shows a precocious mastery of composition&quot;. Ketèlbey competed for a scholarship to Trinity College of Music in London, and received the highest marks of all entrants; the future composer Gustav Holst came second. Ketèlbey entered the college in 1889, studying under G. E. Bambridge (piano), Dr G. Saunders (harmony) and Frederick Corder (composition).

In 1892 Ketèlbey again won the annual scholarship competition and was appointed as the organist at St John&#x27;s Church, Wimbledon, London. He held the post for the next five years, during which time he wrote several anthems and hymns, the latter of which included &quot;Every Good Gift&quot;, &quot;Behold! Upon the Mountains&quot; and &quot;Be Strong! All ye People&quot;. It was around this time he added the accent to his surname, with the aim of moving the stress onto the second syllable, rather than the first. In that year he appeared in a series of concerts in London and provincial cities. In March 1892 at the capital&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Hall he played Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s Scherzo No. 2 in B-flat minor; the reviewer for &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; thought the &quot;brilliant&quot; Ketèlbey played &quot;most beautifully&quot;. He won several prizes at the college before being awarded his certificate in 1895. During this period, &quot;The British Musician&quot; reports, some critics found likenesses between Ketèlbey&#x27;s music and that of Edward German.

Towards the end of his time at the college Ketèlbey wrote lighter, mostly mandolin-based, compositions. As he still aspired to be a serious composer, he adapted the pseudonym Raoul Clifford in an effort to distance himself from the genre. On leaving the college he became one of its examiners in harmony. He wrote piano pieces as part of his role, and used the pseudonym Anton Vodorinski for the work; he subsequently used the name for more serious works, which he published with French titles.

===Early career, 1896–1914===
In 1896 Ketèlbey took up the post of conductor for a travelling light opera company; his father, who wanted his son to be a composer of serious music, disapproved of what he saw as a lightweight role. After a two-year tour Ketèlbey was appointed as musical director of the Opera Comique Theatre—at age 22, the youngest theatrical conductor in London at the time. He moved into a house in Bruton Street, in London&#x27;s Mayfair, where he wrote the song &quot;Blow! Blow! Thou Winter Wind&quot;, to words from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It&quot;. The Opera Comique staged a successful revival of the musical &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; between December 1898 and March 1899, and according to his biographer John Sant, it is possible that Ketèlbey wrote some of the music. This was followed by the comic opera &quot;A Good Time&quot; from April, for which Ketèlbey wrote the music and songs. Following poor reviews, the short run of the piece ended in May and the Opera Comique closed because of the losses brought about by the production. There, Ketèlbey began a relationship with the actress and singer Charlotte &quot;Lottie&quot; Siegenberg. The couple married in 1906 but the relationship was childless.

Ketèlbey wrote music in the style of the Gilbert and Sullivan works for a comic opera &quot;The Wonder Worker&quot;, which was staged at the Grand Theatre, Fulham in 1900. The reviewer for the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; thought Ketèlbey&#x27;s score was &quot;attractive though conventional ... No originality is shown in conception or treatment, but the conception is appropriate, and the treatment effective.&quot; The same year Ketèlbey began undertaking transcription work at the music publisher A. Hammond &amp; Co, making arrangements of music for smaller orchestras. In 1904 he also began to work for a second music publisher, Chappell &amp; Co, a third in 1907, the Columbia Graphophone Company, and a fourth in 1910, when he worked for Elkin &amp; Co. McCanna considers that &quot;this hack-work may have been tedious, but the experience was invaluable in moulding the composer&#x27;s fluent writing for both piano and orchestra&quot;. Throughout the time working for the companies he continued to compose and publish his own work, comprising organ music, songs, duets, piano pieces and anthems. He worked for Columbia for over twenty years and rose to the position of Musical Director and Adviser, working with leading musicians across a range of musical styles; Columbia released more than 600 recordings with Ketèlbey conducting.

In 1912 the composer and cellist Auguste van Biene offered a prize for a new work to complement his popular piece &quot;The Broken Melody&quot;. Ketèlbey was the winner of the competition with a new composition, &quot;The Phantom Melody&quot;, which became his first major success. In the following year he won two prizes totalling £200 in a competition held by &quot;The Evening News&quot;: second place with a song for female voices, and first place with his entry for male voices. The latter song, &quot;My Heart Still Clings to You&quot;, is described by Sant as &quot;a typical tragical-love ballad of this time, and its almost Victorian sentimentality comes through in its words&quot;. In the early to mid-1910s Ketèlbey began to write music for silent films—a new growth industry in Britain from 1910 onwards—and he had great success in the medium until the advent of talking films in the late 1920s.

===Rising reputation and success, 1914–46===

In 1914 Ketèlbey wrote the orchestral work &quot;In a Monastery Garden&quot;, which was published in the following year both as a piano piece and in full orchestral form. It was his first major success, his most famous piece, and became known all over the world; by 1920 over a million copies of the sheet music had been sold. There are two competing stories detailing the inspiration behind the piece: although Ketèlbey later said that he wrote the work for an old friend, he also stated that he composed it after visiting a monastery. The musicologist Peter Dempsey considers that &quot;this piece ... remains to this day a world-renowned staple of the light-music repertoire, while McCanna opines that from the first bar, listeners &quot;... might sooner expect such a device in the impassioned world of a [Gustav] Mahler symphony than in a genteel English salon piece&quot;. The success of &quot;The Phantom Melody&quot; and &quot;In a Monastery Garden&quot; led to Ketèlbey&#x27;s engagement by André Charlot as the musical director for the 1916 revue &quot;Samples!&quot; at the Vaudeville Theatre. The appointment led to similar positions at other London theatres, including the Adelphi, Garrick, Shaftesbury and Drury Lane theatres.

Because of the rise in Ketèlbey&#x27;s popularity, and in sales of his sheet music, in 1918 he became a member of the Performing Rights Society. Except for a brief interval in 1926 when he resigned over a dispute about the allocation of funds to its members, he remained a lifelong member. In 1919 he composed the romantic work &quot;In the Moonlight&quot;, which his publisher considered to be &quot;a work of striking beauty&quot;. In the following year he wrote &quot;Wedgwood Blue&quot;—a gavotte—and &quot;In a Persian Market&quot;; the latter became one of his more popular works. The musicologist Jonathan Bellman, calling &quot;In a Persian Market&quot; &quot;immortal&quot;, describes it as &quot;an &#x27;intermezzo scene&#x27; for band or small orchestra; reprehensibly demeaning or delightfully tacky&quot;. The work was not without its critics; the composer and conductor Nicolas Slonimsky quotes the view of a Russian journal that &quot;the suite ... had its &#x27;immaculate conception&#x27; in imperialistic colonial England. The composer&#x27;s intention is to convince the listener that all&#x27;s well in the colonies where beautiful women and exotic fruits mature together, where beggars and rulers are friends, where there are no imperialists, no restive proletarians.&quot; In &quot;The Musical Times&quot;, the pseudonymous reviewer &quot;Ariel&quot; described the work as &quot;naive and inexpensive pseudo-orientalism&quot;, which led to heated correspondence in the journal over the following months between the composer and the critic.
In 1921 Ketèlbey moved from his home in St John&#x27;s Wood, where he had been living for the previous seven years, to Frognal, an area of Hampstead, north west London. He installed a billiards table in the basement, which became his favoured form of relaxation. He produced a series of orchestral pieces in the first half of the 1920s, including &quot;Bells Across the Meadows&quot; released in 1921, and &quot;Suite Romantique&quot; (1922), which the music critic Tim McDonald considers &quot;impressive&quot;. In the following year Ketèlbey wrote &quot;In a Chinese Temple Garden&quot;, followed in 1924 by &quot;Sanctuary of the Heart&quot; and &quot;Cockney Suite&quot;. The last of these contained the finale &quot;&#x27;Appy &#x27;Ampstead&quot;, which the writers Lewis and Susan Foreman describe as &quot;... a kaleidoscope of passing images, mouth organs, a cornet playing, ... a band, ... shouts of a showman ... with his rattle and a steam engine and roundabout&quot;.

In 1923 the composer Frederic Austin wrote the opera &quot;Polly&quot;, closely based on the 1729 work of the same name by John Gay and Johann Christoph Pepusch; recordings of Austin&#x27;s work were published by Columbia&#x27;s main rival, the Gramophone Company. At Columbia&#x27;s request Ketèlbey produced his own version of Gay&#x27;s original. Austin considered that it copied elements of his, and sued for copyright infringement. Acting as a court expert witness, the composer Sir Frederick Bridge thought that the case &quot;... is an awful bore. ... These two good men are good musicians, and they have no business to be fighting over the game. It is not worth the trouble. ... It is rubbish. I am sick of ″&quot;Polly&quot;″.&quot; After three weeks the case ended with the judge finding against Columbia.

Such was Ketèlbey&#x27;s popularity that by 1924 his works could be heard several times a day in restaurants and cinemas, and in that year the Lyons tea shops spent £150,000 on playing his music in their outlets. He continued to build on his success in 1925 with &quot;In a Lovers&#x27; Garden&quot; and &quot;In the Camp of the Ancient Britons&quot;—inspired by a trip he took to Worlebury Camp, near Weston-super-Mare. He undertook annual tours of Britain, conducting his music with municipal orchestras, and also worked with the BBC Wireless Orchestra. He was invited to conduct several international orchestras, and spent time in Belgium, Germany, France, Switzerland and particularly in the Netherlands, where he built a strong relationship with the Concertgebouw and Kursaal Grand Symphony orchestras. His music was popular on the continent and his obituarist in &quot;The Times&quot; later reported that one Viennese critic considered that Ketèlbey&#x27;s music was behind only that of Johann Strauss and Franz Lehár. Continental audiences often called him &quot;The English Strauss&quot;.

Ketèlbey was financially successful enough to leave Columbia Records in 1926 to spend more time composing, although he continued to conduct for them on an occasional basis, particularly between 1928 and 1930 when he conducted sixteen of his own works with the company, published as &quot;Ketèlbey Conducting his Concert Orchestra&quot;. He spent his time undertaking annual conducting tours and composing, and in 1927 he published &quot;By the Blue Hawaiian Waters&quot; and the suite &quot;In a Fairy Realm&quot;, while in the following year he wrote another suite, &quot;Three Fanciful Etchings&quot;. His works continued to sell well, and in the October 1929 issue of the &quot;Performing Right Gazette&quot; his publisher described him as &quot;Britain&#x27;s greatest living composer&quot;; when the advertisement was mentioned in &quot;The Musical Times&quot;, the anonymous writer wrote &quot;we sympathise with Mr Ketèlbey in being thus raised to a pinnacle which he himself, we are sure, would be very far from claiming.&quot; Sant writes that Ketèlbey subsequently became Britain&#x27;s first millionaire composer. In February 1930 he began what became an annual series of concerts at the Kingsway Hall, conducting a new work, &quot;The Clock and the Dresden Figures&quot;. In a review of the 1933 concert, the critic S.R. Nelson wrote that &quot;as a descriptive writer Ketèlbey really does take some beating. He has the happy knack of combining infinitely melodious themes and the cleverly diluted likeness of the authentic atmosphere.&quot;

The introduction of talking films in 1927 with &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; and the subsequent growth of the medium had a serious impact on composers and music publishers involved in the film industry as it heralded a decline in the sales of sheet music. Although Ketèlbey&#x27;s income from this source declined, the period was also marked by a rise in the popularity of the radio and gramophones and his new compositions were successful with audiences at home. By the early 1930s over 1,500 broadcasts of his work were made on BBC Radio in a year, and more than 700 on continental radio stations, including a weekly Sunday programme of his music, sponsored by Decca Records on Radio Luxembourg. For this programme he wrote the theme music, &quot;Sunday Afternoon Reverie&quot;, with the melody based on the musical notes D E C C A.

Ketèlbey wrote an intermezzo—&quot;A Birthday Greeting&quot;—in 1932, on the sixth birthday of Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II). His connection to royalty continued in 1934, when his march &quot;A State Procession&quot; was played to accompany the arrival of King George V at a Royal Command Performance; the king requested that the march should be played again during the interval, and he and the queen stayed in the royal box to listen to the piece. In the following year Ketèlbey wrote the march &quot;With Honour Crowned&quot; for the King&#x27;s silver jubilee; the work was played for the royal family at Windsor Castle before Ketèlbey conducted its first public performance at Kingsway Hall. The work was played at that year&#x27;s Trooping the Colour and at the Jubilee Thanksgiving Service at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

Ketèlbey continued to conduct on his annual tours during the Second World War, but these were on a smaller scale because of travel restrictions. He also continued with his annual concerts at Kingsway Hall, and introduced a new march, &quot;Fighting for Freedom&quot;, which he had written in a supportive response to Winston Churchill&#x27;s &quot;We shall fight on the beaches&quot; speech. Apart from composing and conducting, he also acted as a Special Constable during the war.

===Post-war; retirement and death, 1946–59===
The winter of 1946–47 was harsh, and in February the sub-zero temperatures burst the water main outside Ketèlbey&#x27;s Hampstead home. With his house partially flooded, he lost most of his correspondence, manuscripts and papers, and he and his wife both contracted pneumonia. The couple were taken to the Regent&#x27;s Park Nursing Home, where Lottie died two days later. He sold his house and moved temporarily to the Hendon Hall Hotel, where he had a nervous breakdown. He spent the remainder of the year staying in hotels in southern England; in Bournemouth he began a relationship with Mabel Maud Pritchett, a hotel manageress, and the couple married in October in the following year.

In 1949 Ketèlbey and his new wife moved to the Isle of Wight, and purchased Rookstone, Egypt Hill, in Cowes, where he partly retired, although he composed occasionally. Tastes in popular music had changed during and after the Second World War and his music declined in popularity; his income in 1940 had been £3,493, which dropped to £2,906 in 1950—a particularly steep drop when wartime inflation is considered. McCanna writes that apart from a commission for the National Brass Band competition in 1945, Ketèlbey produced nothing memorable after the war, and his biographer Keith Anderson considers that in the postwar period Ketèlbey&#x27;s work &quot;... lacked novelty. Of the handful of works published ... most were reworkings of old material, although the composer attempted to disguise the origins&quot;. The BBC also began to ignore his work. In their 1949 Festival of Light Music, none of his compositions were played, which he found distressing. In his letter to the Director-General of the BBC, Sir William Haley, Ketèlbey said the exclusion was &quot;a public insult&quot;. His music still found an audience: in 1952 and 1953 &quot;With Honour Crowned&quot; was again played as a slow march at the Trooping the Colour ceremony.

Ketèlbey died in his Cowes home of heart and renal failure on 26 November 1959. By the time of his death he had slipped into obscurity. Only a handful of mourners attended his funeral, which was held at Golders Green Crematorium in London.

==Music==
Under his own name and at least six pseudonyms, Ketèlbey composed several hundred works, about 150 of them for the orchestra. In the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, Phillip Scowcroft writes, &quot;His gifts for melody and sensitive, colourful scoring ensured continuing popularity with light orchestras and bands until after 1945. The most popular of his hundreds of pieces emphasize emotionalism and sometimes exaggerated effects at the expense of structure and harmonic subtlety.&quot;

===Early works and serious music===
Ketèlbey&#x27;s early compositions are classical and orthodox in form, reflecting the training at Trinity College. The first substantial work was a piano sonata (1888); it was followed by a Caprice for piano and orchestra (1892), a Concertstück for piano and orchestra (circa 1893) and a piano concerto in G minor (1895). Ketèlbey&#x27;s piano writing was notable for its brilliance, and the composer&#x27;s own performance of the solo part of the Concertstück brought out that quality. As a student, Ketèlbey composed a cadenza for the first movement of Beethoven&#x27;s First Piano Concerto, judged &quot;clever and effective&quot; in performance in 1890.

For the chamber repertoire, Ketèlbey composed a string quartet (c. 1896) and a quintet for piano and wind (1896) which won the Costa Prize and the College Gold Medal. His 1894 Romance for violin and piano was praised as &quot;a charming, musicianly work&quot;. His other early works include choral pieces, including the anthems &quot;Every good Gift&quot;; &quot;Behold upon the mountains&quot;, and &quot;Be strong, all ye people&quot; (all 1896). After these works he moved professionally into conducting light opera, and serious music became the exception rather than the rule in his compositions.

Ketèlbey&#x27;s concert music was less well known in England than in continental Europe, where he conducted many programmes of his own works for the Concertgebouw Orchestra and others. The composer&#x27;s more avowedly serious music was less widely esteemed by his compatriots. In a 1928 profile the magazine &quot;The British Musician&quot; commented, &quot;There is no need to explain here why his serious music, whether written thirty years ago or as recently as 1927 ... has not won the popularity of, say, Edward German&#x27;s dances: it is pleasant music, delightfully scored; but it is not so fascinating as that from which it derives—the music of the Viennese writers of dance music, of Delibes and Gounod and the like.&quot; The reviewer added, &quot;Albert Ketèlbey&#x27;s works of the &quot;Monastery Garden&quot; type are by far the best that anyone in this country has written, and they represent the end to which he was born.&quot;

===Light orchestral===
Ketèlbey, a capable player of the cello, clarinet, oboe, and horn, was a skilled orchestrator. He generally followed the normal style for light music of his day: picturesque and romantic, with colourful orchestral effects. Reviewing a collection of Ketèlbey&#x27;s music, the authors of &quot;The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music&quot; commented in 2008, &quot;when vulgarity is called for it is not shirked—only it&#x27;s a stylish kind of vulgarity!&quot; Many of Ketèlbey&#x27;s pieces are programmatic, typically lasting between four and six minutes. His penchant for arranging his works for various combinations of instruments makes them harder to categorise than the works of many other composers. His first two pieces to make a mark with a wide public were &quot;The Phantom Melody&quot; (1911) and &quot;In a Monastery Garden&quot; (1915), both best known in their orchestral versions, but originally written for cello and piano and for solo piano respectively. For the familiar orchestral version of the second of these pieces the composer published a synopsis:

Ketèlbey followed the same basic formula for many of his most popular later works. For &quot;In a Persian Market&quot; his synopsis notes &quot;the camel drivers approaching, the cries of beggars, entry of beautiful princess (represented by a languorous theme given at first to clarinet and cello and then full orchestra) ... she watches the jugglers and snake-charmers ... the Caliph passes by, interrupting the entertainment ... all depart, their themes heard faintly in the distance, and the marketplace becomes deserted.&quot; Ketèlbey establishes the eastern setting in the opening section, employing the distinctive melodic intervals, A–B–E. The orchestral players are instructed to sing at two points in the score, a descending motif representing beggars crying for baksheesh. Although one contemporary critic belittled the music as &quot;pseudo-orientalism&quot;, McCanna comments that &quot;The princess portrayed by the big romantic theme is a cousin of the princesses in Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Firebird&quot;&quot;.

Ketèlbey sought to repeat the exoticism of &quot;In a Persian Market&quot; in several later pieces. Among them is &quot;In a Chinese Temple Garden&quot; (1923), described as an &quot;oriental phantasy&quot;, with episodes depicting a priestly incantation, two lovers, a wedding procession, a street brawl and the restoration of calm by the beating of the temple gong. Another example is &quot;In the Mystic Land of Egypt&quot; (1931), which, like its Persian predecessor, opens with a vigorous march theme followed by a broad romantic melody. Again, the composer employs unconventional musical devices for colour—in this case a chromatic scale, descending at each appearance until the closing bars, where it is inverted. In 1958, the critic Ronald Ever wrote that Ketèlbey was noted for his use of &quot;every exotic noisemaker known to man—chimes, orchestra bells, gongs (all sizes and nationalities), cymbals, woodblocks, xylophone, drums of every variety&quot;. Ever commented that Ketèlbey&#x27;s exoticism had left an immovable impression of eastern music on western ears, to which &quot;Oriental music is Ketèlbey music: the clashing cymbals; the little pinging bells; the minor modes; the amazingly graphic mincing step created by rapidly reiterated notes; the coy taps on the woodblock.&quot;

Among Ketèlbey&#x27;s light orchestral works with a wholly British flavour is &quot;Bells Across the Meadows&quot; (1921), redolent, in the words of McDonald, of &quot;rose-entwined thatched cottages standing amidst gardens full of hollyhocks with a gentle brook bubbling on its rustic way and cows grazing peacefully in the pastures beyond&quot;. Urban life was evoked in the five-movement &quot;Cockney Suite&quot; (1924), described by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;character pieces complete with leering saxophone, cheeky mouth-organ, and some infernally catchy tunes&quot;. Ketèlbey depicts successively a royal procession from Buckingham Palace to the Houses of Parliament; an East End pub, with a main theme based on the Cockney ditty &quot;&#x27;Arf a pint of mild and bitter&quot;; a waltz at a &quot;palais de danse&quot;; a sombre glimpse of the Cenotaph in Whitehall; and in the finale, &quot;&#x27;Appy &#x27;Ampstead&quot;, a picture of the August Bank Holiday fair on Hampstead Heath.

Much of the music Ketèlbey wrote as accompaniment to silent films between 1915 and 1929, though lucrative at the time, has proved ephemeral, although he reused and rearranged some of it in solo pieces for amateur pianists. With the requirements of cinemas of all sizes in mind, his film music was published in the &quot;Bosworth Loose Leaf Film Play Music Series&quot; in versions for solo piano or for small orchestras. The titles offered included &quot;Dramatic Agitato&quot;, &quot;Amaryllis&quot; (described by the composer as &quot;suitable for use in dainty, fickle scenes&quot;), &quot;Mystery&quot; (&quot;greatly in favour for uncanny and weird picturizations&quot;), &quot;Agitato Furioso&quot; (&quot;famous for its excellence in playing to riots, storms, wars, etc.&quot;) and &quot;Bacchanale de Montmartre&quot; (for &quot;cabaret, orgy and riotous continental scenes&quot;).

===Instrumental works===
In addition to arrangements for solo instruments of his popular orchestral works, Ketèlbey wrote a range of music for organ and for piano. Some of the more serious of these pieces were published under his &quot;Vodorinski&quot; pen name. Among the organ works are &quot;Pastorale&quot; and &quot;Rêverie dramatique&quot;, both dating from about 1911. The piano works include the early classical pieces such as the 1888 Sonata, and shorter items in a more popular style, such as &quot;Rêverie&quot; (1894) and &quot;Les pèlerins&quot; (1925), by way of &quot;A Romantic Melody&quot; (1898), &quot;Pensées joyeuses&quot; (1888), &quot;In the Woodlands&quot; (1921), &quot;A Song of Summer&quot; (1922), and &quot;Légende triste&quot; (1923). The musical influences on his piano works were on the whole conservative: for the early works McCanna mentions Haydn and Mendelssohn in this context. Much of the piano music published in the years after the First World War was aimed at a domestic audience; it requires only a modest technical proficiency to play and is simple in structure with deft harmonies. The most commercially successful of the Vodorinski works was the Prelude in C minor (1907). McCanna comments that not only the title but the material is reminiscent of Rachmaninoff: &quot;the music turns out to copy some of the more illustrious composer&#x27;s features, notably the final fortissimo statement of the melody in the bass&quot;. Ketèlbey followed Chopin&#x27;s model in several waltzes in the key of A major, including &quot;La grâcieuse&quot; (1907) and two different pieces under the title Valse brillante (1905 and 1911).

===Songs===
Throughout his career Ketèlbey composed songs, providing the words for most of those written after 1913. His first, unpublished, song, &quot;Be Still, Sad Heart&quot; dates from 1892, and during the rest of the 1890s he wrote songs for children as well as sentimental ballads like &quot;Believe Me True&quot; (1897) for their seniors. Many had words by Florence Hoare, whose other lyrics included English words for songs by Tchaikovsky, Gounod and Brahms. Ketèlbey&#x27;s popular ballads included &quot;The Heart&#x27;s Awakening&quot; (1907), &quot;My Heart-a-dream&quot; (1909), &quot;I Loved You More Than I Knew&quot; (1912), &quot;My Heart Still Clings to You&quot; (1913), &quot;Will You Forgive?&quot; (1924), and &quot;A Birthday Song&quot; (1933). He wrote patriotic songs for use in three wars: &quot;There&#x27;s Something in the English After all&quot; (1899, during the Boer War), &quot;The Trumpet Voice of Motherland is Calling&quot; (1914, for the First World War) and &quot;Fighting for Freedom&quot; (1941, during the Second World War). His sole Shakespeare setting, &quot;Blow! Blow! Thou Winter Wind&quot; (1898, revised 1951), was written as incidental music for a production of &quot;As You Like It&quot;.

==Reputation and legacy==

The obituarist for &quot;The Musical Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Ketèlbey&#x27;s especial fame ... consisted in his phenomenal success as a composer of light music. His remarkable gift for alluring tunes, rich in homely sentiment, was reflected in the immense popularity of [his] pieces&quot;. McCanna opines that Ketèlbey&#x27;s popularity

lay in its memorable expressive melodies combined with its ability to set the scene by enhanced use of different kinds of colour: local colour in the choice of characteristic settings, often with explicit narrative captions printed above the music; musical colour in the form of exotic scales and harmonies; orchestral colour in the novel use of singing by the players and of sound effects executed by the drummer.

During his tenure at Columbia, Ketèlbey promoted the works of several composers, including Haydn Wood, Charles Ancliffe, Ivor Novello, James W. Tate and Kenneth J. Alford, helping to increase the popularity of British light music. Ronnie Ronalde made &quot;In a Monastery Garden&quot; his signature tune from 1958, while Serge Gainsbourg used the theme of &quot;In a Persian Market&quot; for his 1977 song &quot;My Lady Héroïne&quot;.

Dempsey, writing in 2001, considered that Ketèlbey&#x27;s &quot;late-Romantic tone miniatures ... are deserving of reappraisal&quot;. The composer&#x27;s reputation has improved over time, and the cultural historian Andrew Blake identifies a &quot;form of &#x27;cult following&#x27;&quot; for him. In the 21st century, Ketèlbey&#x27;s music is still frequently heard on radio and in a 2003 poll by the BBC radio programme &quot;Your Hundred Best Tunes&quot;, &quot;Bells across the Meadows&quot; was voted thirty-sixth most popular tune of all time. The last night of the corporation&#x27;s 2009 Proms season included &quot;In a Monastery Garden&quot; to mark the fiftieth anniversary of Ketèlbey&#x27;s death; it was the first time the tune had been included in the festival&#x27;s finale. Tim Page, the music critic for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, considers that Ketèlbey&#x27;s work expresses an &quot;ornate, perfumed, genteel Orientalism [which] found expression in miniatures&quot;; he adds that &quot;all of Ketèlbey&#x27;s music is pretty weird—deeply derivative yet unmistakably personal, tidy in form yet grandiose in execution, amiable and often touching despite its unashamed mawkishness.&quot;

<text>Nicole Fontaine (16 January 1942 – 17 May 2018) was a French politician who served as Member of the European Parliament for the Île-de-France from 1984 until 2002 and from 2004 until 2009. She was a member of the Union for a Popular Movement, part of the European People&#x27;s Party. Fontaine was the President of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2001 and was then replaced by Pat Cox, from the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, in accordance with an agreement between the two groups at the start of the term.

==Early life and education==
Born in 1942 in Normandy, the daughter of a doctor and the granddaughter of primary school teachers, she was awarded a degree in law in 1962 at the age of 20, the diploma of the Sciences Po in 1964 and a doctorate in public law in 1969. She was a lawyer and a member of the bar of the department of Hauts-de-Seine. Republished four times and widely distributed, her doctoral thesis on relations between the State and private teaching establishments linked by contract to the public sector has become the standard reference work in that area.

==Political career==
For almost 20 years Fontaine had national responsibility for the sensitive issue of relations between the private education sector and the public authorities at the Secrétariat général de l&#x27;Enseignement catholique (Catholic Education Secretariat), first of all as legal adviser, then as deputy secretary-general from 1972 to 1981 and finally as chief representative from 1981 to 1984. She was closely involved in discussions concerning and often the driving force behind the legislative and statutory changes which, over a period of two decades, shaped the legal framework which provides for balanced relations between the State and the private establishments linked by contract to the public education service.

Fontaine was a member of the Conseil supérior de l&#x27;Education nationale (National Education Council) from 1975 to 1981 and a member of its standing committee from 1978 to 1981. Between 1980 and 1984 she was a member of the Conseil économique et social (Economic and Social Council), to which she submitted a report on publishing policy.

===Member of the European Parliament, 1984–2002===
Fontaine entered politics late in her career to become a Member of the European Parliament in the 1984 elections, in the wake of the major demonstration in Paris in favour of private education which ultimately led to a settlement based on the principle of freedom of education. During her first term of office, her work focused on an area whose importance for the future is still underestimated, given the predominance of economic issues: a citizens&#x27; Europe. In that connection, she concentrated more particularly on projects concerning youth, community life and the mutual recognition of diplomas, the key to professional mobility and freedom of establishment throughout the European Community.

She worked primarily as a member of three parliamentary committees: the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens&#x27; Rights, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, and the Committee on Women&#x27;s Rights and Gender Equality.

In the 1989 elections, Fontaine was re-elected to the European Parliament on the centrist list led by Simone Veil and elected vice-president of the European Parliament. In that capacity, she was a member of Parliament&#x27;s Bureau and represented the Assembly on the European Parliament - National Parliaments Joint Delegation.

In January 1994 Fontaine was appointed by her political group, the European People&#x27;s Party, to sit as a permanent member on the Conciliation Committee established by the Maastricht Treaty; the role of that committee is to settle disputes outstanding at the end of legislative procedures involving the European Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. She was the only French permanent member of the committee. She was also chairman of the European Parliament delegation to the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union (COSAC), which is the forum for cooperation between the national parliaments and the European Parliament.

In the run-up to the 1994 European Parliament election, Fontaine published a work intended to make the general public more familiar with the European Parliament, entitled Les députés européens: Qui sont-ils? Que font-ils? (MEPs: who are they? what do they do?). In June 1994 she was re-elected to the European Parliament for a third term of office. In July she was also re-elected a vice-president of the Parliament and became, by virtue of the number of votes obtained, first vice-president of the European Parliament. She retained that position in January 1997. In that capacity, she co-chaired the Conciliation Committee with the president-in-office of the Council of Ministers.

In August 1997 Fontaine published a guide to community aid schemes, entitled &quot;L&#x27;Europe de vos initiatives&quot;, and then in October 1998 a layman&#x27;s guide to the Amsterdam Treaty entitled Le traité d&#x27;Amsterdam, à l&#x27;attention de ceux qui aimeraient s&#x27;intéresser à l&#x27;Europe si elle était moins obscure (the Amsterdam Treaty for those who would like to take an interest in Europe but find it difficult to understand).

At the national level, Fontaine served as vice president of the UDF and, as an ex-officio member, of the UDF&#x27;s Executive Committee and Political Bureau. In second place on the list led by François Bayrou, she was re-elected to the European Parliament in June 1999.

Standing against Mário Soares for the post of President of the European Parliament, she was elected by a majority of the votes cast in the first round on 20 July 1999. She led the Parliament from 1999 to 2002. A profile by &quot;The Economist&quot; from that time described her as &quot;a consensus-seeker, coalition-builder, conciliator ... nowhere more at home than in the Byzantine corridors of Europe, canvassing cross-party support, flashing her smile, teasing out compromise&quot;.

===Career in the French government===
Fontaine served as France&#x27;s industrial minister between 2002 and 2004 in the government of President Jacques Chirac.

===Member of the European Parliament, 2004–2009===
In her final term as a member of the European Parliament, Fontaine served on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on Women&#x27;s Rights and Gender Equality. In addition to her committee assignments, she was a member of the Parliament&#x27;s delegation for relations with Afghanistan.

==Political positions==
In 2007, Fontaine led an unsuccessful campaign to press for French to be designated the European Union&#x27;s benchmark legal language.

==Recognition==
Paying tribute to her, President Emmanuel Macron said: &quot;For 35 years of her life, she fought for the European project&quot;.
==Honours==
* Grand Cordon of the Order of Ouissam Alaouite (Morocco, 2000)
* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic (, 2002)
* Commander of the National Order of Merit (, 2009)
* Knight of the Légion d&#x27;honneur (, 2014)
