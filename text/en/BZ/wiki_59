<text>Hurricane Fabian was a powerful tropical cyclone that impacted Bermuda in early September during the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the sixth named storm, fourth hurricane, and first major hurricane of the season, developed from a tropical wave in the tropical Atlantic Ocean on August 25. It moved west-northwestward under the influence of the subtropical ridge to its north, and steadily strengthened in an area of warm sea surface temperatures and light wind shear. The hurricane attained a peak intensity of on September 1, and it slowly weakened as it turned northward. On September 5, Fabian made a direct hit on Bermuda with wind speeds of over . After passing the island, the hurricane turned to the northeast, and became extratropical on September 8, before dissipating two days later.

Fabian was the strongest hurricane to hit Bermuda since Hurricane Arlene in 1963. It was both the most damaging and the first hurricane to cause a death on the island since 1926. The hurricane&#x27;s powerful winds resulted in moderate damage and destroyed roofs throughout the island. A strong storm surge associated with the hurricane killed four people crossing a causeway on Bermuda, temporarily closing the only link between two islands. The endangered Bermuda petrel, better known as the cahow, was threatened by the hurricane, which destroyed ten nests, although volunteer work transported the species to a safer location. Strong swells resulted in damage in northern Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, and also caused four people to drown along the United States&#x27; Atlantic coast. In all, Fabian caused around US$300 million in damage and eight deaths.

==Meteorological history==

On August 25, a tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa. Tracking westward, the wave developed convection over its center, and conducive conditions allowed it to develop further. The system passed through the Cape Verde islands later that day as convection steadily weakened. Early on August 27, convection again increased and consolidated near the center, and later that day the wave developed into Tropical Depression Ten while located west of the Cape Verde islands. Moving westward into an area of warm waters and low vertical shear, the depression steadily intensified, and was named Tropical Storm Fabian on August 28 as convection increased and banding features became more prominent.

Banding features and outflow continued to develop as a ring of convection formed around the center of Fabian, and on August 30, the storm intensified into a hurricane while gradually slowing its motion to the west-northwest. As banding features and outflow became better defined, an eye developed in the center of the deepest convection. Fabian quickly strengthened and attained major hurricane status late that day. Deep convection became very concentric around the wide eye, and the hurricane reached winds of early on August 31. At this time, the deepest convection near the eye degraded in appearance, and Fabian temporarily stopped its strengthening trend. Later that day, the eye became distinct again within a perfectly round area of deep convection. Outflow continued to expand in all directions, and Fabian intensified into a Category 4 hurricane late on August 31. Thunderstorm activity near the eyewall became more intense, and the cloud tops in the eyewall became much cooler; simultaneously, outflow away from the eye became much more symmetrical, both signs of an intensifying tropical cyclone. Fabian reached its peak intensity of on September 1 while located east of the northern Lesser Antilles.
After maintaining its peak intensity for 12 hours Fabian degraded due to internal fluctuations, and began to weaken. The hurricane turned to the northwest on September 2 in response to a weakness in the subtropical ridge, a break caused by a mid-level circulation over the southwest Atlantic Ocean. After fading back to a Category 3 hurricane, Fabian re-intensified on September 4, and regained Category 4 status for a short time. The hurricane weakened again as it accelerated northward towards Bermuda, a motion due to an approaching mid-level trough. As small pockets of dry air became entrained in the eyewall, Fabian weakened slightly, passing just west of Bermuda on September 5 as a Category 3 hurricane. The eastern portion of the eyewall moved over the island, resulting in a direct hit; the center did not move over the island, so Fabian did not make landfall. After passing the island, the hurricane accelerated northeastward, and weakened to a Category 2 hurricane on September 7. Steady weakening occurred as the hurricane moved into an area of increasing wind shear, drier air, and progressively cooler waters. On September 8, while located east-northeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland, Fabian transitioned into an extratropical storm, with no deep convection remaining near the center. Fabian&#x27;s extratropical remnant turned to the north on September 9, and on September 10, Fabian&#x27;s remnant merged with another extratropical storm while located between southern Greenland and Iceland.

== Preparations ==
Several days prior to Fabian striking Bermuda, computer models forecast a ridge of high pressure forcing the hurricane to the west of the island by . Not expected to be a direct threat, a meteorologist at the Bermuda Weather Service expected gusty winds and potentially heavy rainfall. Each successive advisory was issued as the hurricane steadily moved closer to Bermuda, and 35 hours before Fabian made its closest approach, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a hurricane watch for the island. When a track near Bermuda became more certain, a hurricane warning was issued for the island, approximately 29 hours before Fabian made a direct hit on the island.

The Bermuda Electric Light Company Limited recommended Bermuda residents to buy hurricane supplies such as candles, batteries, and non-perishable foods, to fill bathtubs and extra containers with water, and fill gasoline tanks for automobiles. In preparation, residents formed long lines at gas stations, banks, and supermarkets. All government offices and many businesses closed on the day prior to the hurricane hitting. All schools were closed, while all flights in and out of the island were canceled. Officials opened emergency shelters, and recommended 2,000 low-lying residents to evacuate; a hotel on the south shore of the island was evacuated as well. Several cruise ships expected to remain on the island departed early to avoid the hurricane. Local insurance companies on Bermuda experienced a great increase in business, as residents renewed lapsed policies or signed up for new policies for homes or businesses, though marine policies were stopped several days before the hurricane struck. The arrival of Fabian forced the cancellation or delay of several sports events, including a cricket match, a football game, and a dinghy race.

==Impact==

Fabian killed eight people and caused US$300 million in damages, primarily in Bermuda.

===Caribbean===
The hurricane produced storm surge damage in Antigua and Barbuda, where some boats were lightly damaged. Strong swells and high tides produced large waves on the north coast of Puerto Rico, washing out beaches in various locations. Waves knocked out a portion of a construction site in Ocean Park, resulting in US in damage. In the Dominican Republic, the hurricane produced waves of up to in height. Due to the waves and gusty winds, boats were advised to stay at port. Several families had to be evacuated in Nagua when rough seas flooded their homes.

===Bermuda===

Hurricane Fabian struck Bermuda on Friday, 5 September 2003, with sustained winds having reached by 0800, by 1400, and by 1755. The eye did not pass directly over the archipelago, instead passing to the west (placing Bermuda in the northeast quarter where the winds were particularly powerful) with the eyewall dragging over Bermuda for three hours. This prolonged the damaging winds the island was subjected to. The storm produced a 10-minute average wind speed of , while a peak wind gust of occurred at Bermuda Harbour Radio. The strongest of the winds lasted approximately three to four hours, and while the eastern portion of the eyewall moved over the island, winds decreased to . Large waves battered the southern portion of the island for several days, reaching heights of at the worst of the hurricane, and upon passing the island, the hurricane produced a storm surge exceeding in height. Due to its fast motion, rainfall totals rose to only . There were also several unofficial reports of tornadoes. Strong rip currents from the hurricane persisted for several days prior to Fabian passing the island; two swimmers were caught in the currents and relied on lifeguard assistance to return to shore. As a result, rip tide warnings were posted for the island.
Strong waves caused extensive damage to the coastline, especially on the southern portion of Bermuda. The strong waves broke a boat from its moorings at Spanish Point. Not wanting to lose the ship, the owner, accompanied with two people, tried to save the vessel. One fell overboard before climbing aboard the boat. The three ventured the vessel through tornadoes and waves, which dropped several feet of water in the ship; ultimately they safely arrived at Hamilton Harbour. Five charter boats capsized from the waves, while several others crashed against reefs. Strong waves collapsed a sea wall in Hamilton, causing traffic jams for one day until it was fixed.

The winds downed numerous power lines, causing 78% of the island&#x27;s 32,031 power customers to experience power outages. The strong winds damaged or destroyed the roofs of numerous buildings on Bermuda. One of the areas lightest hit was around a hotel outside of Hamilton, which experienced no power outages or blown out windows, while one of the harder hit areas was Warwick. There, one resident noted, &quot;Too many homes have lost roofs to count&quot;. One house was entirely destroyed on Rec View Hill, while an unconfirmed tornado destroyed much of the roof of a house in Devonshire. The hurricane destroyed a restaurant in Southampton and also damaged stands and roofs at sports facilities. Strong winds from the hurricane damaged several landmark buildings, including the House of Assembly and the City Hall, both in Hamilton, and the former military headquarters in St. George&#x27;s.

Bermuda International Airport sustained US$15 million in damages, primarily to buildings and roadways which were washed away by the storm surge. The runway escaped major damage, however, and the airport re-opened the following day for emergency relief flights. Confronting the damages in the storm&#x27;s aftermath, Airport General Manager James G. Howes was quoted by the news media as saying, &quot;My heart sank when I first saw the Airport that morning. There was tons of debris everywhere and all the fire alarms and security alarms were going off. There was this din of bells and horns – it was like a war zone&quot;. Commercial airline service was suspended for three days due to heavy damage to the Terminal Building, which was flooded with of seawater. The airport&#x27;s ILS and radar were also damaged.

The hurricane also affected the Bermuda Weather Service, as waves destroyed recording equipment. The winds severely damaged the island&#x27;s major hotels, closing five for extended periods to repair damage. One hotel that remained open experienced damage to 25% of its rooms. The strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees along the island&#x27;s golf courses, though little damage was reported at most courses. One course experienced significant damage at its club house, temporarily closing it.

Government Conservation Officer Dr. David B. Wingate reported the damage to the South Shore of Bermuda was the worst in a thousand years. The strong winds blew down hundreds of trees, caused severe damage to vegetation, and destroyed many of the island&#x27;s indigenous plants. The hurricane washed away large sections of the nesting island for the endangered Bermuda petrel and destroyed 10 of the 70 active nests. The endangered birds were not on the island, though local residents quickly gathered to restore their habitat. Strong waves resulted in severe coastal erosion, and at one beach, the lack of sand destroyed a natural cove. The Natural Arches, a set of eroded stones resembling an arch that was popular in photographs, was destroyed by the waves. The powerful winds knocked coconuts off several trees and scattered them across the ground.

The storm surge from the hurricane stranded one vehicle with three police officers and another with a resident on the causeway between St. George&#x27;s Parish and St. David&#x27;s Island. After a fire truck failed in its attempt to rescue them, powerful waves washed the vehicles into Castle Harbour. The United States Coast Guard and Bermuda police divers mounted a full-scale search for the missing people during the worst of the storm. The strong winds and emotional issues of searching for colleagues made the search difficult. Ultimately, the vehicles and one dead body were recovered, with the others remaining missing, presumably dead. Another vehicle was on the causeway as the two cars became stranded, though the driver was able to safely cross. High winds and surf tore off the causeway&#x27;s side walls and greatly damaged the structure, temporarily closing it to automobile traffic.

As most people were well-prepared, these were the only four deaths on the island. In addition, nine people sought medical attention for minor injuries. Damage on Bermuda totaled to US$300 million, reportedly the worst to affect the area since 1926.

===Atlantic coast===
Swells from the hurricane produced rip currents and heavy surf along the eastern North Carolina coastline. One man drowned near Cape Hatteras from the rip currents. Fabian produced moderate surfing conditions along the East Coast of the United States, primarily from Georgia to North Carolina. Three deaths were reported in the north Atlantic when a ship, &quot;The Pacific Attitude&quot;, sank south of Newfoundland in the Grand Banks due to strong waves of over in height.

==Aftermath==

Blocked roads initially caused delays to crews from the Bermuda Electric Light Company Limited (BELCO), which were attempting to restore power to the island. Of high priority among the places to be restored were the hospital, as well as hotels to accommodate tourists who remained on the island through the storm. By the second day after the storm passed the island, power was restored to 11,000 residents. Power on Bermuda was restored to all customers within three weeks of the hurricane, but the electricity supply distribution system was greatly weakened. This resulted in a rehabilitation plan implemented in October 2003. Days after the hurricane passed, moisture from Tropical Storm Henri resulted in thunderstorms and heavy rainfall; this hindered recovery efforts, but did not cause any reported damage. Lack of power caused interruptions to communications. While an emergency broadcast station was installed and tested prior the hurricane, the hurricane caused a problem to the system&#x27;s back-up generator. The causeway in Bermuda remained closed for several days after the hurricane as road crews made temporary repairs. Upon being opened three days after the storm, traffic was limited to one lane of the original two. However, the causeway had to be closed in the event of rain, winds exceeding , and at night. The bridge was fully repaired by early November 2003.

In the days after the storm, people provided assistance for each other, especially for the elderly. Three days after the storm, for example, a radio station DJ announced a name for an elderly person in need, and within minutes someone would call to provide for their needs. Residents cleared smaller roads from debris with chainsaws, which in turn helped the power companies to make repairs quickly. As a result of damage on their homes, dozens of people stayed in five shelters or undamaged hotels. Residents purchased large quantities of gasoline in the days after Fabian, some of whom bought over US$500 worth. Officials assured there was no shortage, but requested drivers to conserve gas. XL Capital Ltd. shipped 250 tarpaulins, 10 electric generators, and rope supply to the island. The UK government offered help to the island with two Royal Navy ships with supplies such as tents, dried foods, and blankets. Premier Alex Scott declined the offer, believing the island could withstand on its own. World Vision also offered assistance with blankets, tents, and other supplies, while two United States companies offered to send generators. Bermuda Electric Light Company received aid from the Caribbean Electric Organization, which sent over 20 electricians to repair power lines.
Initially, the time for the destroyed vegetation on Bermuda to regrow was estimated to take decades. To help, the South Carolina Maritime Heritage Foundation, with support from a Boy Scout troop and nearby nurseries, delivered 1,000 boxwood plants to the island. Following the damage to the Bermuda petrel&#x27;s habitat, Bermuda&#x27;s Department of Conservation carried out a translocation program, which involved moving the habitat to Nonsuch Island. That island, a long-standing nature preserve, was much higher and safer for the birds, and by two years after the hurricane the population numbers were higher than before the storm.

Shortly after the hurricane, the American home improvement franchise &quot;This Old House&quot;, unaware of the limited extent of damage, decided to do a hurricane repair story. Upon realising that there would be little to nothing available for the &quot;Ask This Old House&quot; to repair, it was decided instead to do a renovation of an 1805 home in St. George&#x27;s. It was only the second time that the franchise had worked outside of the United States.

A memorial to the four Bermudians whose lives were claimed by Hurricane Fabian was erected near the Causeway&#x27;s east end by the airport, where the 10th anniversary of their deaths was remembered by government officials in September 2013. The onslaught of Hurricane Gonzalo in October 2014 prompted a catastrophe modeller to revisit Fabian&#x27;s destruction, concluding that had it struck in 2014, it would have caused around US$650 million in damage.

===Retirement===

Due to the storm damage and deaths in Bermuda, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name &quot;Fabian&quot; in the spring of 2004, and it will never again be used for a North Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with &quot;Fred&quot; for the 2009 season.

The Bermuda Weather Service allowed residents to suggest a replacement name, with the only rule being the name had to be a male name beginning with the letter &quot;F&quot;, able to be easily pronounced, and not currently in use by the National Hurricane Center. The service received a list of over 30 names, including &quot;Forrest&quot; and &quot;Frodo&quot;, after the character in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The Bermuda Weather Service sent three names to the World Meteorological Organization: &quot;Fred&quot;, &quot;Ford&quot;, and &quot;Flynn&quot;.

<doc id="742857" wikidata="Q6841142" url="?curid=742857" title="Midday (Australian TV program)">
<text>Midday (commonly referred to as The Midday Show) is an Australian award-winning daytime television program, based on the variety format that aired on the Nine Network on 11 February 1985 until 27 November 1998. The show aired, like its title suggests, at noon, on a weekday schedule, and was a 90-minute variety programme with international and local guests. It featured interviews, musical performances and comedy spots. The format of the show was similar to that of its predecessor, &quot;The Mike Walsh Show&quot;, which it replaced in the lunch time slot.

==Program history / hosts==

=== Ray Martin (1985–1993) ===
Leading Mike Walsh&#x27;s resignation from &quot;The Mike Walsh Show&quot;, Ray Martin was appointed as his successor in 1985, despite being known primarily as a journalist from &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. The program was re-titled to &quot;The Midday Show with Ray Martin&quot;, which was later shortened to &quot;Midday with Ray Martin&quot;, and finally &quot;Ray Martin at Midday&quot; in 1993. Although Martin was seen as a shock choice at the time of his appointment, he soon became increasingly popular with viewers.

During his time on the show, a highly publicised on-air scuffle took place in 1991 between former pop idol Normie Rowe and radio personality Ron Casey.

While Martin was at the helm, members of the &quot;Midday&quot; on-camera team included musical director Geoff Harvey; comedians Graham Pugh, Ross Daniels, Ewan Campbell; trumpeter Bob Bouffler; and pre &quot;Big Brother&quot; presenter Gretel Killeen. Ray Martin remained as host until late 1993, when he was moved to replace Mike Willesee as host of &quot;A Current Affair&quot;, which had seen a ratings decline over the previous year.

Martin ended up being a popular host on the show. He won the Gold Logie for his role 3 times – in 1987, 1993 and 1994. He was nominated for the award in 1986, 1990, 1991 and 1992. Jean Stafford was a regular on &quot;Midday with Ray Martin&quot; from 1986 to 1993 with over 47 performances.

=== Derryn Hinch (1994) ===
Following Martin&#x27;s departure to &quot;A Current Affair&quot;, Derryn Hinch was appointed as host shortly after being sacked from his self-titled current affairs program on the Ten Network. The show effectively reverted partially to its old title by becoming &quot;Midday With Derryn Hinch&quot;. Hinch&#x27;s appointment was seen by many as a shock decision, as he had previously been known as a hard-hitting, outspoken personality. Many were therefore surprised to see him showing a softer side in his role as &quot;Midday&quot; host. Gradually-declining ratings over previous years saw the show axed at the end of 1994 (Derryn had offered to resign for the good of the show, but stated in interviews that Nine Network executives made it clear that it was the &quot;show&quot; that was being axed rather than the &quot;host&quot;).

=== Tracy Grimshaw and David Reyne (1995) ===
Following the announcement of the program&#x27;s axing at the end of 1994, it had been stated that the show would be replaced by a new talk program. After a six-month absence, a lower-budget hour-long program using the &quot;Midday&quot; title began. In its new form, the show had a more generic feel to it, with no live band and none of the loose &quot;variety show&quot; feeling of the program in its previous incarnation. After the network had considered a number of personalities for the hosting job including Larry Emdur, Richard Wilkins and Monte Dwyer, it was announced that Tracy Grimshaw and David Reyne were to be the co-hosts of this version. However, only six months later the program was again reformatted, effectively making it more reminiscent of the Mike Walsh/Ray Martin eras.

=== Kerri-Anne Kennerley (1996–1998) ===
In 1996, Kerri-Anne Kennerley was appointed to the new incarnation of the show, with the title becoming &quot;Midday with Kerri-Anne&quot;. Geoff Harvey re-joined the show from a period of semi-retirement, albeit with a streamlined, six-piece band and not the full orchestra the show had had in previous days. Initially, Kerri-Anne caused a resurgence in ratings, with her enthusiasm and her tendency to physically interact with guests (i.e. doing dance steps with dancers, attempting to play the respective sports of sporting personalities) rather than confining herself to sit-down interviews. She gained three consecutive Gold Logie nominations for her work on the show, and was widely praised for &quot;bringing the magic back to &quot;Midday&quot;&quot;. However, the show was eventually not able to compete with better rating, imported programs on other networks, and the general decline of locally produced daytime talk shows and budget concerns that prompted the 1994 axing caused the show to again be axed at the end of 1998.

The final &quot;Midday&quot; program aired on 27 November 1998, running for a length of 150 minutes and featuring an array of guests including Maggie Tabberer, Brian Bury, Doug Mulray, Derryn Hinch, Don Lane, Ron Casey, Barry Crocker and Dame Edna.

===Guest hosts===
The program would occasionally use guest presenters, usually personalities from other Nine Network programs, who would fill in for the regular hosts of the show.

A notable guest host in 1985 was John Howard who filled in for Ray Martin on 30 August 1985. Howard, who was deputy opposition leader at the time, was the network&#x27;s second choice after initially approaching opposition leader and Liberal Party leader Andrew Peacock who declined the invitation to host the show. Howard is believed to have chosen his own guests which included political journalists Richard Carleton and Laurie Oakes, cricketer Bill O&#x27;Reilly and actress Carmen Duncan.

Within a week of Howard hosting &quot;Midday&quot;, Peacock unsuccessfully attempted to replace Howard as deputy opposition leader with John Moore which led to the 1985 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill which ultimately saw Howard replace Peacock as Liberal Party leader.

==Awards==
The show and hosts have won several Logie awards, and been nominated for several too.

Gold Logie: 
* Won: 3 times – Ray Martin (1987, 1993, 1994)
* Nominated: 7 times – Ray Martin (1986, 1990–1992); Kerri-Anne Kennerley (1997–1999)

&quot;Midday&quot; and its predecessor &quot;The Mike Walsh Show&quot; won a combined total of 24 Logie Awards for the Nine Network.

==Post-&quot;Midday&quot; and legacy==
Following the program&#x27;s demise in November 1998, the following year, Kerri-Anne was appointed to co-host the cooking show &quot;What&#x27;s Cooking&quot;, alternating host Geoff Jansz&#x27;s cooking segments with her interviews which were not related to cooking. This was seen as an awkward change to the show, which was axed at the end of that year, causing Kerri-Anne to leave the network, openly criticising the format that &quot;What&#x27;s Cooking&quot; was given. After spending some time in other media and a second stint at Network Ten, Kerri-Anne returned to Nine to host &quot;Mornings with Kerri-Anne (later shortened to &quot;Kerri-Anne&quot;)&quot;, a morning talk show with some similarities to &quot;Midday&quot;, but without a live audience (except on an occasional basis) and with heavy infomercial content. &quot;Kerri-Anne&quot; was eventually replaced with a new incarnation of &quot;Mornings &quot;(now &quot;Today Extra&quot;) presented by David Campbell and Sonia Kruger in 2012. Kruger later resigned from the program and the network at the end of 2019, with former &quot;Today&quot; news presenter Sylvia Jeffreys announced as her replacement.

&quot;Midday&quot; and various memorable events associated with the program continue to be regularly recalled in the Australian media, including an incident when an entertainer appeared to juggle chainsaws and live kittens which prompted complaints.

Another &quot;Midday&quot; incident often referred to occurred in 1996 when host Kerri-Anne Kennerley, following a serious political discussion, coaxed Federal Treasurer Peter Costello into learning the &quot;Macarena&quot;.

In 2020, media personality Lisa Wilkinson recalled a tense exchange she had with Nine boss Kerry Packer after being a guest on &quot;Midday&quot; in her capacity as the editor of &quot;Cleo&quot;, also owned by Packer. During her appearance on &quot;Midday&quot;, Wilkinson had revealed she had decided to discontinue the nude centrefold but had done so without consulting Packer which prompted him to immediately phone her to discuss the matter.

In 2019, there were unsubstantiated reports the Seven Network was considering relaunching their own version of &quot;Midday&quot;. Also that same year, the Nine Network launched &quot;Australia&#x27;s Top 10 Of Everything&quot;, a show featuring a look at all things nostagia including clips of interviews and segments from past and present flagship Nine programs including clips from &quot;Midday&quot;. Since the programs inception in 2019,it has been rerun numerous times.

Ongoing tension between &quot;Midday&quot; hosts Derryn Hinch and Kerri-Anne Kennerley has also kept attention on the program.

In 2020, there was reported speculation that the Nine Network was considering relaunching the &quot;Midday&quot; show in the near future with Kerri-Anne Kennerley and Samantha Armytage touted as potential hosts. Should a revival ever proceed, it is likely that the potential refreshed program would move away from the 80s, 90s variety halcyon days and replicate a format similar to &quot;Today Extra&quot; with heavy informercial content.

<doc id="742879" wikidata="Q1267485" url="?curid=742879" title="Villa Madama">
<text>Villa Madama is a Renaissance-style rural palace (villa) located on Via di Villa Madama #250 in Rome, Italy. Located west of the city center and a few miles north of the Vatican, and just south of the Foro Olimpico Stadium. Even though incomplete, this villa with its loggia and segmented columned garden court and its casino with an open center and terraced gardens, was initially planned by Raphael, and highly influential for subsequent architects of the High Renaissance.

==Construction==
In the 1518, then the Cardinal Giulio de&#x27; Medici, cousin of the reigning pontiff Leo X, commissioned the initial design of the villa from Raphael. However Raphael died in 1520, and the work continued under disciples of Raphael, including Antonio da Sangallo the Younger in construction and a large team involved in the decoration. There appear to have been frequent disputes over the plans. Construction soon ceased and the villa was far from complete, when after the death of Leo X in 1521, the cardinal had returned to Florence. In 1523, with Giulio de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s ascension to Pope Clement VII, work restarted and the apartment and garden loggia were completed that year. The decorations of the Villa are by Giulio Romano and Baldassare Peruzzi, both major architects in their own right; Giovanni da Udine completed the bas-reliefs in stucco, inspired by the classic Ancient Roman reliefs unearthed from the then rediscovered &quot;Domus Aurea&quot; of Nero; and finally, both Giovan Francesco Penni (&quot;il Fattore&quot;) and the Florentine sculptor Baccio Bandinelli worked there too. Aside from the Raphael loggia, the villa&#x27;s greatest artistic element is the &quot;salone&quot; painted by Giulio Romano, with its magnificent vaulted ceiling.

In 1527, during the Sack of Rome, parts of the structure were pillaged and suffered from fire. Some sections were rebuilt, but the villa was never completed. It is not entirely clear how much of the layout and decoration can be attributed to any one of the artists involved.

==Legacy and gardens==
The Villa Madama was one of the first of the revived Roman type of suburban villas designed for parties and entertainment built in 16th century Rome, and it was consciously conceived to rival descriptions of the villas of Antiquity, like Pliny&#x27;s famous description of his own.

It had a courtyard with a monumental flight of steps, a circular court around which formal gardens were arranged, an open-air theater excavated in the hillside, a hippodrome below, and a terraced garden with views of the Tiber river.

In the garden facing the loggia, the Elephant Fountain, designed by Giovanni da Udine, commemorates the Indian elephant &quot;Annone&quot;, brought to Rome by a Portuguese ambassador for the consecration of Leo X in 1514.

==Ownership after completion==
The &quot;Madama&quot; of its name was Margaret of Austria, the same who is remembered in Palazzo Madama in Rome, seat of the Italian Senate. After the death of Clement VII, the villa remained Medici property, first belonging to Cardinal Ippolito de&#x27; Medici, and later to Duke Alessandro, Lord of Florence, who married Margaret of Parma the illegitimate daughter of Charles V, but left her a widow at the age of 15. She married Ottavio Farnese, a nephew of Pope Paul III and was soon widowed again, but at Margaret&#x27;s death, the villa passed into the Farnese family, Dukes of Parma and Piacenza, who let it slowly fall into ruin.

The villa was restored by Count Carlo Dentice di Frasso, who acquired the property in 1925, and his American wife, the former Dorothy Cadwell Taylor. Eventually the Frassos leased it to the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and it was soon purchased by Mussolini in 1941. Mussolini&#x27;s monumental neo-Roman Foro Italico sports complex is next to the villa, on the site of its racetrack.

Villa Madama is the property of the Italian Government, which uses it for international guests and press conferences. Entrance is limited and touring of gardens requires prior permission with Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On April 20, 2015 the Italian EU Presidency hosted a dinner in the Villa Madama for all Speakers and Presidents of national parliaments of the European Union.

<text>Method &amp; Red, sometimes written Meth and Red, is an American television sitcom that originally ran on Fox from June 16 to September 15, 2004. It starred hip hop recording artists Method Man &amp; Redman, portraying fictionalized versions of themselves who move to a predominantly white upper-class suburb in New Jersey.

Fox cancelled the show with 4 of the 13 episodes remaining unaired after heated meetings with Method Man and Redman, who were not pleased with the show. The duo publicly criticized Fox several times after this.

Method Man criticized the series for having a laugh track and Fox doing a bad job on editing. He had wanted it to be in the vein of &quot;Arrested Development,&quot; of which he is a fan.

<text>Rosa Maria Perez (born September 6, 1964) is an American actress. Her breakthrough came at age 24 with her portrayal of Tina in the film &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; (1989), followed by &quot;White Men Can&#x27;t Jump&quot; (1992). Perez&#x27;s performance in &quot;Fearless&quot; (1993) earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, among other accolades. Her starring film roles since include &quot;It Could Happen to You&quot; (1994), &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot; (2000), &quot;Pineapple Express&quot; (2008), and &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; (2020).

Perez earned three Primetime Emmy Award nominations for &quot;In Living Color&quot; (1990–1994) and another Emmy nomination for her work in &quot;The Flight Attendant&quot; (2020–22). She has performed in stage plays on Broadway such as &quot;The Ritz&quot;, &quot;Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune&quot;, and &quot;Fish in the Dark&quot;. She was also a co-host on the ABC talk show &quot;The View&quot; during the series&#x27; 18th season. Perez additionally had a role in season 2 of the Showtime series, &quot;Your Honor&quot;.

== Early life ==
Perez was born on September 6, 1964, in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City, to Lydia Pérez and Ismael Serrano, a merchant marine seaman. Her mother Lydia (née Fontañez y Reyes) was born in Humacao, Puerto Rico. Her father was from Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. Her mother was married to a man 20 years her senior, Arturo Pérez. Her mother already had five children when she became pregnant with Rosie after having an affair with Serrano. Perez was born at the now-closed Greenpoint Hospital in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn.

One of 10 children born to her mother, Perez grew up in Bushwick with her siblings while their mother was intermittently jailed. Her mother gave birth to her youngest child while incarcerated. She was for a time raised by an aunt and then, like her siblings, went through group homes and foster care. She and her siblings were often split up. She was transferred to a group foster home and lived in foster care in New York and Peekskill until the age of eight. She was legally considered a ward of the State of New York until age 12. Her mother and aunt frequently visited, and her father made an unsuccessful custody bid at one point.

When she was in third grade, Perez learned that she had a speech impediment. She had a strict Catholic upbringing, which she has credited to the influence of the nuns during her childhood. She eventually moved in with her paternal aunt, Ana Dominga Otero Serrano-Roque.

She attended Grover Cleveland High School, in the Ridgewood neighborhood of Queens. By 1999, her mother was living in poverty in the Woodside Houses, when she died of AIDS-related complications.

== Career ==

At 19 years old, Perez started her career in the early 1980s as a dancer on &quot;Soul Train.&quot; As a student at Los Angeles City College, with plans to major in biochemistry, she said she relieved stress by going to nightclubs for ladies&#x27; night. A talent scout from &quot;Soul Train&quot; asked Perez to appear on the show. She was not a professional dancer, but loved it so much she dropped out of school. In 1988, when she was 23 years old, Perez was noticed at the dance club Funky Reggae by Spike Lee, who hired her for her first major acting role in &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; (1989).

Perez later choreographed music videos by Janet Jackson, Bobby Brown, Diana Ross, LL Cool J and The Boys. She was the choreographer for the dancing group the Fly Girls, who were featured on the Fox television comedy program &quot;In Living Color&quot;, and also worked as a segment producer. She made her Broadway debut in Terrence McNally&#x27;s &quot;Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune&quot;. Perez had her third major role in the hit comedy &quot;White Men Can&#x27;t Jump&quot; (1992) co-starring Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson.

Perez was nominated for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role in Peter Weir&#x27;s 1993 film &quot;Fearless&quot;. She attended the ceremony with her father. In 1994, she co-starred with Nicolas Cage in &quot;It Could Happen to You&quot;. In 1997, she co-starred with Javier Bardem in &quot;Perdita Durango&quot; where she played the titular character, a film in which many scenes of violence, sex and nudity were edited out of the version released in the United States but remained intact in the version released throughout Latin America. In 1999, Perez starred in Nancy Savoca&#x27;s &quot;The 24 Hour Woman.&quot; She provides the voices of Click, the camera, on Nick Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Go, Diego, Go!&quot; (2005-11) and Chel, a beautiful native woman in the DreamWorks Animation film &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot; (2000). She played corrupt police officer Carol Brazier in the Judd Apatow-produced film &quot;Pineapple Express&quot; (2008), co-starring Seth Rogen and James Franco.

Perez appeared on an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; in October 2009 about pedophiles&#x27; rights. Executive producer Neal Baer said the writers had Perez in mind when they wrote the role of a young sexual abuse victim&#x27;s mother. She injured her neck while filming the episode and underwent surgery to heal a herniated disc. One year after the accident, she appeared at the White House in a wheelchair, wearing a neck brace for a meeting with President Obama. In May 2011, Perez filed a lawsuit against the producers of the show, saying the injury she incurred was the result of being &quot;recklessly pulled, grabbed, yanked, wrenched and manhandled&quot; during filming.

In June 2013, she served as the grand marshal for the international Boxing Hall of Fame parade in Canastota, New York. In February 2014, Perez published an autobiography titled &quot;Handbook for an Unpredictable Life: How I Survived Sister Renata and My Crazy Mother, and Still Came Out Smiling...&quot; She is also the reader of the audio CD of this book. Perez said that she did not initially set out to write an autobiography, but rather a book that analyzes the causes and effects of child abuse. She said it was not until about 6 months after the book was published and she heard responses from others that she found the experience cathartic.

On September 3 of the same year, ABC announced Perez would join &quot;The View&quot; as a new co-host alongside moderator Whoopi Goldberg, newcomer Nicolle Wallace, and returning co-host Rosie O&#x27;Donnell. The new season began on September 15, 2014. Perez said she was initially hesitant about the job because &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to be on a show where people were just screaming at each other disrespectfully.&quot; She decided to join the cast when she learned that Bill Wolff, whom she knew from &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot;, was going to be the new executive producer. In 2015, she returned to Broadway to star in &quot;Fish in the Dark&quot;, a play written by Larry David. On July 8, 2015, Perez announced she would be leaving &quot;The View&quot;.

In 2018, in a series regular role, Perez portrayed Tracey Wolfe in the NBC musical drama television series &quot;Rise&quot;, which ran for one season. She starred in the 2020 superhero film &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;, as the DC Entertainment superhero Renee Montoya / Question. Later that year, Perez starred in the comedy-drama series &quot;The Flight Attendant&quot;. She earned a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for the role. 

In 2021 Perez starred in the film adaptation of the children&#x27;s book series &quot;Clifford the Big Red Dog&quot;. In 2023, she had a role in season 2 of the Showtime series &quot;Your Honor&quot;.

She is an official commentator for the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson boxing match.

== Activism ==

An English-language campaign was also directed by Liev Schreiber.

* On January 6, 2000, she was arrested for disorderly conduct in Manhattan following a rally to protest against the U.S. Navy air weapons training, as well as other forms of payload on the government training range owned at Vieques, an island off the coast of Puerto Rico.
* Perez serves as the chair of the artistic board for Urban Arts Partnership, a New York City arts education nonprofit that uses arts integrated education programs to close the achievement gap.

== Personal life ==
Perez has suffered from high anxiety, PTSD, and depression but with therapy it has been greatly reduced.

<doc id="742915" wikidata="Q6961610" url="?curid=742915" title="Names for association football">
<text>There are many terms used to describe association football, the sport most commonly referred to in the English-speaking world as &quot;football&quot; or &quot;soccer&quot;.
== Background ==
The rules of association football were codified in England by the Football Association in 1863. The alternative name &quot;soccer&quot; was first coined in late 19th century England to help distinguish between several codes of football that were growing in popularity at that time, in particular rugby football. The word &quot;soccer&quot; is an abbreviation of &quot;association&quot; (from &quot;assoc.&quot;) and first appeared in English public schools and universities in the 1880s (sometimes using the variant spelling &quot;socker&quot;) where it retains some popularity of use to this day. The word is sometimes credited to Charles Wreford-Brown, an Oxford University student said to have been fond of shortened forms such as &quot;brekkers&quot; for breakfast and &quot;rugger&quot; for rugby football (see Oxford &quot;-er&quot;). However, the attribution to Wreford-Brown in particular is generally considered to be spurious. Clive Toye notes that &quot;they took the third, fourth and fifth letters of Association and called it SOCcer.&quot;

The sport&#x27;s full name &quot;association football&quot; has never been widely used, although in Britain some clubs in rugby football strongholds adopted the suffix &quot;Association Football Club&quot; (&quot;A.F.C.&quot;) to avoid confusion with the dominant sport in their area, and FIFA, the world governing body for the sport, is a French-language acronym of &quot;Fédération Internationale de Football Association&quot; – the International Association Football Federation. &quot;Soccer football&quot; is used less often than it once was: the United States Soccer Federation was known as the United States Soccer Football Association from 1945 until 1974, when it adopted its current name; and the Canadian Soccer Association was known as the Canadian Soccer Football Association from 1958 to 1971.

=== Transition away from &quot;soccer&quot; in Britain ===

For nearly a hundred years after it was first coined, &quot;soccer&quot; was used as an uncontroversial alternative in Britain to &quot;football&quot;, often in colloquial and juvenile contexts, but was also widely used in formal speech and in writing about the game. &quot;Soccer&quot; was a term used by the upper class, whereas the working and middle classes preferred the word &quot;football&quot;; as the upper class lost influence in British society from the 1960s on, &quot;football&quot; supplanted &quot;soccer&quot; as the most commonly used and accepted word. The use of &quot;soccer&quot; is declining in Britain and is now considered (albeit incorrectly, due to the word&#x27;s British origin) to be an exclusively American English term. Since the early twenty-first century, the peak association football authorities in &quot;soccer&quot;-labeling Australia and New Zealand have actively promoted the use of &quot;football&quot; to mirror international usage and, at least in the Australian case, to rebrand a sport that had been experiencing difficulties. Both bodies dropped &quot;soccer&quot; from their names. These efforts have met with considerable success in New Zealand, but have not taken effect well in Australia or Papua New Guinea.

== English-speaking countries ==
Usage of the various names of association football vary among the countries and territories which use English as an official or &quot;de facto&quot; official language. The brief survey of usage below addresses places which have some level of autonomy in the sport and their own separate federation but are not actually independent countries: for example the constituent countries of the United Kingdom and some overseas territories each have their own federation and national team. Not included are places such as Cyprus, where English is widely spoken on the ground but is not amongst the country&#x27;s specifically stated official languages.

=== Countries where it is called football ===
Association football is known as &quot;football&quot; in the majority of countries where English is an official language, such as the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth Caribbean (including Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Belize, Barbados, and others), Nepal, Malta, India, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Cameroon, Pakistan, Liberia, Singapore, Hong Kong and others, stretching over many regions including parts of Europe, Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and Central America. In North America and Australia (where approximately 70 per cent of native English speakers reside), soccer is the primary term.

&quot;Fitbaa&quot;, &quot;fitba&quot; or &quot;fitbaw&quot; is a rendering of the Scots pronunciation of &quot;football&quot;.

=== North America ===
In the United States, where American football is more popular, the word &quot;football&quot; is used to refer only to that sport. Association football is most commonly referred to as &quot;soccer&quot;.

As early as 1911 there were several names in use for the sport in the Americas. A 29 December 1911 &quot;New York Times&quot; article reporting on the addition of the game as an official collegiate sport in the US referred to it as &quot;association football&quot;, &quot;soccer&quot; and &quot;soccer football&quot; all in a single article.

The sport&#x27;s governing body is the United States Soccer Federation; however, it was originally called the &quot;U.S. Football Association&quot;, and was formed in 1913 by the merger of the &quot;American Football Association&quot; and the &quot;American Amateur Football Association&quot;. The word &quot;soccer&quot; was added to the name in 1945, making it the &quot;U.S. Soccer Football Association&quot;, and it did not drop the word &quot;football&quot; until 1974, when it assumed its current name.

In Canada, similar to the United States, the term &quot;football&quot; refers to gridiron football (either Canadian football or American football; &quot;le football canadien&quot; or &quot;le football américain&quot; in Standard French). &quot;Soccer&quot; is the name for association football in Canadian English (similarly, in Canadian French, &quot;le soccer&quot;). Likewise, in majority francophone Quebec, the provincial governing body is the &quot;Fédération de Soccer du Québec&quot;. This is unusual compared to francophone countries, where &quot;football&quot; is generally used. Canada&#x27;s national body government of the sport is named the Canada &quot;Soccer&quot; Association, although at first its original name was the &quot;Dominion of Canada&quot; Football &quot;Association&quot;.

Some teams based in Canada and the United States have adopted &quot;FC&quot; as a suffix or prefix in their names. In Major League Soccer, these include Austin FC, Minnesota United FC, Chicago Fire FC, Atlanta United FC, FC Dallas, Seattle Sounders FC, Toronto FC, Vancouver Whitecaps FC, New York City FC, Los Angeles FC, FC Cincinnati and Charlotte FC. Two MLS teams (Inter Miami CF and CF Montréal) use &quot;CF&quot; as a suffix or prefix in their names, reflecting the Spanish-speaking and Francophone communities where they play. Most teams in the Canadian Premier League use &quot;FC&quot; as a suffix. Exceptions are FC Edmonton which uses a prefix, and Atlético Ottawa which uses neither, to match its parent Atlético Madrid.

In Central America, the only English-speaking nation is Belize, and like the other six Central American nations, the unqualified term &quot;football&quot; refers to association football, as used in the Football Federation of Belize and in the Belize Premier Football League. However, the term &quot;soccer&quot; is sometimes used in vernacular speech and media coverage.

In the Caribbean, most of the English-speaking members use the word &quot;football&quot; for their federations and leagues, the exception being the U.S. Virgin Islands, where both federation and league use the word &quot;soccer&quot;.

An exceptional case is the largely Spanish-speaking Puerto Rico, where the word &quot;football&quot; is used in the Puerto Rican Football Federation, while the word &quot;soccer&quot; is used in the Puerto Rico Soccer League, the Puerto Rican 1st division; however, its 2nd division is named Liga Nacional de Futbol de Puerto Rico. &quot;Soccer&quot; is the most common term in vernacular speech, however. Another case is the Dutch island of Sint Maarten, where soccer is used in Sint Maarten Soccer Association, but neither &quot;football&quot; nor &quot;soccer&quot; appears in its league name: instead, the Dutch voetbal is used.

=== Australia ===

Traditionally, the sport has been mainly referred to as soccer in Australia. This is primarily due to Australian rules football and rugby league taking precedence of the name in conversation due to their greater cultural prominence and popularity - similarly to North America and gridiron football. However, in 2005, the Australia Soccer Association changed its name to Football Federation Australia, and it now encourages the use of &quot;football&quot; to describe the association code in line with international practice. All state organisations, many clubs, and most media outlets have followed its example. The &quot;Macquarie Dictionary&quot; observed, writing prior to 2010: &quot;While it is still the case that, in general use, soccer is the preferred term in Australia for what most of the world calls football, the fact that the peak body in Australia has officially adopted the term football for this sport will undoubtedly cause a shift in usage.&quot; This was highlighted shortly afterwards when then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard, speaking in Melbourne, referred to the sport as football, emphasising her choice when questioned. The Australian men&#x27;s team is still known by its long-standing nickname, the Socceroos, the Soccer Ashes is still referred to as such, and &quot;soccer&quot; is still the most popular term for the sport in Australia.

Historically, the derogatory term &quot;wogball&quot; has been used to refer to the sport. This is due to &quot;wog&quot; being a derogatory (but since appropriated in some contexts) term referring to Australians of Mediterranean background (particularly Croatians, Egyptians, Greeks, Italians, Lebanese, Macedonians, Maltese and Turks), among whom the sport was most popular. It was also derogatorily described as a game for &quot;sheilas, wogs and poofters&quot; (with &quot;sheilas&quot; being women and &quot;poofters&quot; being homosexuals). Former Australian soccer player Johnny Warren later released a book titled &quot;Sheilas, Wogs and Poofters&quot;.

==== Australian media ====
The debate over whether &quot;soccer&quot; or &quot;football&quot; should be used has extended to the media. Many media outlets use different terminology.

Association football is referred to as &quot;football&quot; by many outlets, including &quot;ABC News, &quot; &quot;News.com.au&quot; and &quot;The Australian&quot;. However, many others still use the term &quot;soccer&quot;, including &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and &quot;The West Australian&quot;.

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand English, association football has historically been called &quot;soccer&quot;. As late as 2005, the &quot;New Zealand Oxford Dictionary&quot; suggested that in that country &quot;football&quot; referred especially to rugby union; it also noted that rugby union was commonly called &quot;rugby&quot;, while rugby league was called &quot;league&quot;. A year earlier, New Zealand Soccer had reorganised its leading competition as the New Zealand Football Championship, and in 2007 it changed its own name to New Zealand Football. The wider language community appears to have embraced the new terminology—influenced, among other things, by television coverage of association football in other parts of the world—so that today, according to &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot;, &quot;most people no longer think or talk of rugby as &#x27;football&#x27;. A transformation has quietly occurred, and most people are happy to apply that name to the world&#x27;s most popular game, dispensing with &#x27;soccer&#x27; in the process.&quot;

=== Papua New Guinea ===
In Papua New Guinea and other parts of Melanesia, the term &quot;soccer&quot; is the preferred term for the sport, due to the large Australian influence in the region. In Papua New Guinea, the national association is the Papua New Guinea Football Association but the national league is the Papua New Guinea National Soccer League. In Tok Pisin, &quot;soka&quot; refers to &quot;soccer&quot;, &quot;ragbi&quot; refers to rugby and &quot;futbal&quot; refers to other codes of football (i.e. Australian rules football, or &quot;futbal bilong Ostrelia&quot;).

=== Other English-speaking countries ===
On the island of Ireland, &quot;football&quot; or &quot;footballer&quot; most often refers to association football or Gaelic football. It may also refer to rugby union. The association football federations are called the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) and the Irish Football Association (IFA) and the top clubs are called &quot;Football Club&quot;. Furthermore, those whose primary interest lies in this game often call their sport &quot;football&quot; and refer to Gaelic football as &quot;Gaelic football&quot; or &quot;Gaelic&quot; (although they may also use &quot;soccer&quot;). The terms &quot;football&quot; and &quot;soccer&quot; are used interchangeably in Ireland&#x27;s media.

In most of Ulster, the northern province in Ireland, especially in Northern Ireland, East Donegal and Inishowen, association football is usually referred to as &#x27;football&#x27; while Gaelic football is usually referred to as &#x27;Gaelic&#x27;.

In Pakistan, Liberia, Nigeria and other English-speaking countries, both football and soccer are used both officially and commonly.

== Non-English-speaking countries ==
Association football, in its modern form, was exported by the British to much of the rest of the world and many of these nations adopted this common English term for the sport into their own language. This was usually done in one of two ways: either by directly importing the word itself, or as a calque by translating its constituent parts, &quot;foot&quot; and &quot;ball&quot;. In English, the word &quot;football&quot; was known in writing by the 14th century, as laws which prohibit similar games date back to at least that century.

* Icelandic: &quot;fótbolti&quot;, but &quot;knattspyrna&quot; (from &quot;knöttur&quot; (&quot;ball&quot;) + &quot;spyrna&quot; (&quot;kicking&quot;)) is almost equally used.
* Karelian: &quot;jalgamiäččy&quot;
* Kinyarwanda: umupira w&#x27;amaguru(from &quot;umupira&quot; (&quot;ball&quot;) + &quot;amaguru&quot; (&quot;legs&quot;), literally &quot;ball of legs&quot;)

* Vietnamese: &quot;bóng đá&quot; (ball - kick)
* Welsh: &quot;pêl-droed&quot;

In the first half of the 20th century, in Spanish and Portuguese, new words were created to replace &quot;football&quot; (&quot;fútbol&quot; in Spanish and &quot;futebol&quot; in Portuguese), &quot;balompié&quot; (&quot;balón&quot; and &quot;pie&quot; meaning &quot;ball&quot; and &quot;foot&quot;) and &quot;ludopédio&quot; (from words meaning &quot;game&quot; and &quot;foot&quot;) respectively. However, these words were not widely accepted and are now only used in club names such as Real Betis Balompié and Albacete Balompié.

=== From &quot;soccer&quot; ===
* Afrikaans: , echoing the predominant use of &quot;soccer&quot; in South African English.
* Australian Kriol: 
* Bislama: 
* Bulgarian: (&quot;sokur&quot;)
* Canadian French: , pronounced like the English word. In Quebec, in New-Brunswick, etc. the word refers either to American or Canadian football, following the usage of English-speaking North America.
* Fijian: 
* Japanese: &quot;sakkā&quot; () is more common than &quot;futtobōru&quot; () because of American influence following World War II. While the Japan Football Association uses the word &quot;football&quot; in its official English name, the Association&#x27;s Japanese name uses &quot;sakkā&quot;.
* Irish: 
* Manx Gaelic: or 
* Māori: 
* Pijin: 
* Samoan: 
* Swahili: 
* Tok Pisin: 
* Tongan: 
* Torres Strait Creole: 

=== Other forms ===
* Italian: &quot;calcio&quot; (from &quot;calciare&quot;, meaning &quot;to kick&quot;), although &quot;football&quot; is also universally understood, as many clubs include &quot;Football Club&quot; in their official denomination. This is due to the game&#x27;s resemblance to Calcio Fiorentino, a 16th-century ceremonial Florentine court ritual, that has now been revived under the name &quot;calcio storico&quot; or &quot;calcio in costume&quot; (&quot;historical kick&quot; or &quot;kick in costume&quot;).
* Bosnian, Croatian, Slovene: &quot;nogomet&quot;. The word is derived from &quot;noga&quot; (meaning &quot;leg&quot;) and &quot;met&quot; (meaning &quot;to throw&quot;), hence &quot;throwing the ball using legs&quot;.
* In Erzya: &quot;пильгеоска&quot; (&quot;pilgeoska&quot;).
* In Komi: &quot;коксяр&quot; (&quot;koksyar&quot;).
* In Hungarian, &quot;futball&quot; or &quot;labdarúgás&quot; (meaning &quot;ball-kicking&quot;), but &quot;foci&quot; is used in the common language.
* In Burmese, where the game was introduced in the 1880s by Sir James George Scott, it is called &quot;ball-pwe&quot;, a &quot;pwe&quot; being a rural all-night dance party, something like a rave.
* Lao: &quot;ເຕະບານ&quot; is derived from the following words: ເຕະ (&quot;kick&quot;) and ບານ (&quot;ball&quot;)
* In Navajo: &quot;jooł nabízníltaałí&quot;, meaning &quot;ball is kicked around&quot;.
* In Vietnamese, the terms &quot;bóng đá&quot; and &quot;đá banh&quot; (the latter is only used in certain regions), both literally meaning &quot;ball-kicking&quot;, are used to denote &quot;football&quot;. Sometime Sino-Vietnamese term &quot;túc cầu&quot; (足球) is used.
* In Indonesian, the term &quot;sepak bola&quot; (&quot;ball kicking&quot;) is used whereas Malaysian and Singaporean Malay use &quot;bola sepak&quot; (&quot;kickball&quot;); the latter is famously attested in the 1859 Jawi booklet &quot;Inilah Risalat Peraturan Bola Sepak Yang Dinamai oleh Inggeris&quot; Football (&quot;This is a Rulebook for Kick-ball that the English call &quot;Football&quot;&quot;) printed in Singapore.
* In Korean, the Sino-Korean derived term &quot;chukku&quot; (蹴球 축구 ), &quot;kick-ball&quot;, is used.
* In Swahili, the word &quot;kandanda&quot; which has no transparent etymology, is used alongside &quot;mpira wa miguu&quot; and &quot;soka&quot;.
* In Khmer, the term &quot;បាល់ទាត់&quot; &quot;(kick-ball)&quot; is used.

=== Other terminology ===
Aside from the name of the game itself, other foreign words based on English football terms include versions in many languages of the word &quot;goal&quot; (often &quot;gol&quot; in Romance languages). In German-speaking Switzerland, &quot;schútte&quot; (Basel) or &quot;tschuutte&quot; (Zürich), derived from the English &quot;shoot&quot;, means &#x27;to play football&#x27;. Also, words derived from &quot;kick&quot; have found their way into German (noun &quot;Kicker&quot;) and Swedish (verb &quot;kicka&quot;). In France &quot;le penalty&quot; means a penalty kick. However, the phrase &quot;tir au but&quot; (lit. &quot;shot(s) on the goal&quot;) is often used in the context of a penalty shootout. In Bulgaria a penalty kick is called duzpa (&quot;дузпа&quot;, from French words &quot;douze pas&quot; – twelve steps). In Italy, alongside the term &quot;calcio&quot;, is often used &quot;pallone&quot; (literally &quot;ball&quot; in Italian), especially in Sicily (&quot;u palluni&quot;). In Hong Kong, 十二碼 (literally ten two yard, where ten two means twelve) is referring to the penalty kick, which is at 12 yards away from the goal line.

In Brazilian Portuguese, because of the pervasive presence of football in Brazilian culture, many words related to the sport have found their way into the language, while others where were literally translated into pre-existing Portuguese terms; an example is &quot;Tiro de Meta&quot;, a literal translation of &quot;Goal Kick&quot;, but while &quot;&quot;Meta&quot; is used some rare times colloquially, the official term for both the score and the area inside the goal posts is &quot;Gol&quot;. Another example is the Brazilian term for offside, &quot;Impedimento&quot;&quot; lit. meaning &quot;to block&quot; or &quot;to obstruct&quot;, instead of &quot;Fora de Jogo&quot; or &quot;Fora de Lado&quot;.

Some expressions became common in the language, such as &quot;Show de Bola&quot; that, while literally meaning &quot;Ball Show&quot; its often used in regular talks to show that is something &quot;Good&quot; or &quot;Great&quot;.

<doc id="742923" wikidata="Q2288728" url="?curid=742923" title="Bushwick, Brooklyn">
<text>Bushwick is a neighborhood in the northern part of the New York City borough of Brooklyn. It is bounded by the neighborhood of Ridgewood, Queens, to the northeast; Williamsburg to the northwest; the cemeteries of Highland Park to the southeast; and Bedford–Stuyvesant to the south and southwest.

The town was first founded by the Dutch as Boswijck during the Dutch colonization of the Americas in the 17th century. In the 19th century, the neighborhood became a community of German immigrants and their descendants. The 20th century saw an influx of Italian immigrants and Italian-Americans up to the 1980s. By the late 20th century, the neighborhood became predominantly Hispanic as another wave of immigrants arrived. Formerly Brooklyn&#x27;s 18th Ward, the neighborhood was once an independent town and has undergone various territorial changes throughout its history.

Bushwick is part of Brooklyn Community District 4, and its primary ZIP Codes are 11206, 11207, 11221, and 11237. It is patrolled by the 83rd Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Politically it is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 34th and 37th Districts.

==Geography==

Bushwick&#x27;s borders largely overlap those of Brooklyn Community Board 4, which is delineated by Flushing Avenue on the north, Broadway on the southwest, the border with Queens to the northeast, and the Cemetery of the Evergreens on the southeast. The industrial area north of Flushing Avenue, east of Bushwick Avenue, and south of Grand Street is commonly considered to be either East Williamsburg or part of Bushwick, occasionally with the modifier &quot;Industrial Bushwick&quot;.

The town of Bushwick—which, along with Brooklyn and Bedford, became incorporated as the city of Brooklyn on January 1, 1854—included present-day Williamsburg and Greenpoint. Prior to the merger, in the early 19th century, residential development in the area had begun when the new district of Williamsburg was laid out in western Bushwick. Williamsburg was incorporated in 1827 and officially severed from Bushwick in 1839. Present-day East Williamsburg, which was not part of the city of Williamsburg, was originally organized primarily as Brooklyn&#x27;s 18th Ward from the annexation of Bushwick. Now part of Brooklyn Community District 1, the area of East Williamsburg is nevertheless considered by some to be part of Bushwick.

For its entry on Bushwick–Ridgewood, the American Institute of Architects&#x27; &quot;AIA Guide to New York City&quot; uses the area bounded by the Cemetery Belt on the south, Bushwick Avenue on the west (save for a short distance between Bushwick Avenue&#x27;s northern terminus and the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway, where Woodpoint Road and Kingsland Avenue are the western boundaries), the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway on the north, and the Brooklyn–Queens border on the east—thus including the industrial area north of Flushing Avenue and east of Bushwick Avenue.

The centroid, or geographic center, of New York City is located on Stockholm Street in Bushwick, on the block between Wyckoff and St. Nicholas Avenues.

==History==
===Bushwick township===

In 1638, the Dutch West India Company secured a deed from the local Lenape people for the Bushwick area, and Peter Stuyvesant chartered the area in 1661, naming it &quot;Boswijck&quot;, meaning &quot;neighborhood in the woods&quot; in 17th-century Dutch. Its area included the modern-day communities of Bushwick, Williamsburg, and Greenpoint. Bushwick was the last of the original six Dutch towns of Brooklyn to be established within New Netherland.

The community was settled, though unchartered, on February 16, 1660, on a plot of land between the Bushwick and Newtown Creeks by fourteen French and Huguenot settlers, a Dutch translator named Peter Jan De Witt, and one of the original eleven slaves brought to New Netherland, Franciscus the Negro, who had worked his way to freedom. The group centered their settlement on a church located near today&#x27;s Bushwick and Metropolitan Avenues. The major thoroughfare was Woodpoint Road, which allowed farmers to bring their goods to the town dock. This original settlement came to be known as &quot;Het Dorp&quot; by the Dutch, and, later, Bushwick Green by the British. The English would take over the six towns three years later and unite them under Kings County in 1683.

Many of Bushwick&#x27;s Dutch records were lost after its annexation by Brooklyn in 1854. Contemporary reports differ on the reason: T. W. Field writes that &quot;a nice functionary of the [Brooklyn] City Hall ... contemptuously thrust them into his waste-paper sacks&quot;, while Eugene Armbruster claims that the movable bookcase containing the records &quot;was coveted by some municipal officer, who turned its contents upon the floor&quot;.

At the turn of the 19th century, Bushwick consisted of four villages: Green Point, Bushwick Shore (later known as Williamsburg), Bushwick Green, and Bushwick Crossroads (at the spot where today&#x27;s Bushwick Avenue turns southeast at Flushing Avenue).

Bushwick&#x27;s first major expansion occurred after it annexed the New Lots of Bushwick, a hilly upland originally claimed by Native Americans in the first treaties they signed with European colonists granting the settlers rights to the lowland on the water. After the second war between the natives and the settlers broke out, the natives fled, leaving the area to be divided among the six towns in Kings County. Bushwick had the prime location to absorb its new tract of land in a contiguous fashion. New Bushwick Lane (Evergreen Avenue), a former Native American trail, was a key thoroughfare for accessing this new tract, which was suitable mostly for potato and cabbage agriculture. This area is bounded roughly by Flushing Avenue to the north and Evergreen Cemetery to the south. In the 1850s, the New Lots of Bushwick area began to develop. References to the town of Bowronville, a new neighborhood contained within the area south of Lafayette Avenue and Stanhope Street, began to appear in the 1850s.

The area known as Bushwick Shore was so called for about 140 years. Bushwick residents called Bushwick Shore &quot;the Strand&quot;, the Dutch term for &quot;beach&quot;. Bushwick Creek, in the north, and Cripplebush, a region of thick, boggy shrubland extending from Wallabout Creek to Newtown Creek, in the south and east, cut Bushwick Shore off from the other villages in Bushwick. Farmers and gardeners from the other Bushwick villages sent their goods to Bushwick Shore to be ferried to New York City for sale at a market located at the present-day Grand Street. Bushwick Shore&#x27;s favorable location close to New York City led to the creation of several farming developments. Originally a development within Bushwick Shore, Williamsburgh rapidly expanded during the first half of the 19th century and eventually seceded from Bushwick to form its own independent city in 1852. Both Bushwick and Williamsburgh were annexed to the City of Brooklyn in 1854.

===Early industry===
When Bushwick was founded, it was primarily an area for farming food and tobacco. As Brooklyn and New York City grew, factories that manufactured sugar, oil, and chemicals were built. The inventor Peter Cooper built a glue manufacturing plant, his first factory, in Bushwick. Immigrants from western Europe joined the original Dutch settlers. The Bushwick Chemical Works, at Metropolitan Avenue and Grand Street on the English Kills channel, was another early industry among the lime, plaster, and brickworks, coal yards, and other factories that developed along English Kills, which was dredged and made an important commercial waterway.

In October 1867, the American Institute awarded Bushwick Chemical Works the first premium for commercial acids of the greatest purity and strength. The Bushwick Glass Company, later known as Brookfield Glass Company, established itself in 1869, when a local brewer sold it to James Brookfield. It made a variety of bottles and jars, as well as large numbers of glass electrical insulators for telegraph, telephone and power lines.
In the 1840s and 1850s, a majority of the immigrants were German, which became the dominant population. Bushwick established a considerable brewery industry, including &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Row&quot;—14 breweries operating in a 14-block area—by 1890. Thus, Bushwick was dubbed the &quot;beer capital of the Northeast&quot;. The last Bushwick breweries, the Schaefer&#x27;s and Rheingold Breweries, closed its doors in 1976. As late as the 1980s, there were unsuccessful efforts to revive the Rheingold Brewery. The William Ulmer Brewery at Beaver and Belvidere Streets was given landmark status by the city in 2010, becoming the first brewery with such a status.

As late as 1883, Bushwick maintained open farming land east of Flushing Avenue. A synergy developed between the brewers and the farmers during this period, as the dairy farmers collected spent grain and hops for cow feed. The dairy farmers sold milk and other dairy products to consumers in Brooklyn. Both industries supported blacksmiths, wheelwrights, and feed stores along Flushing Avenue.

===Railway hub===

In 1868, the Long Island Rail Road built the Bushwick Branch from its hub in Jamaica via Maspeth to Bushwick Terminal, at the intersection of Montrose and Bushwick avenues, allowing easy movement of passengers, raw materials, and finished goods. Routes also radiated to Flushing, Queens.

The first elevated railway (&quot;el&quot;) in Brooklyn, known as the Lexington Avenue Elevated, opened in 1885. Its eastern terminus was at the edge of Bushwick, at Gates Avenue and Broadway. This line was extended southeastward into East New York shortly thereafter. By the end of 1889, the Broadway Elevated and the Myrtle Avenue Elevated were completed, enabling easier access to Downtown Brooklyn and Manhattan and the rapid residential development of Bushwick from farmland.

With the success of the brewing industry and the presence of the els, another wave of European immigrants settled in the neighborhood. Also, parts of Bushwick became affluent. Brewery owners and doctors commissioned mansions along Bushwick and Irving Avenues at the turn of the 20th century. New York mayor John Francis Hylan kept a townhouse on Bushwick Avenue during this period.

Bushwick homes were designed in the Italianate, Neo Greco, Romanesque Revival, and Queen Anne styles by well-known architects. Bushwick was a center of culture, with several Vaudeville-era playhouses, including the Amphion Theatre, the nation&#x27;s first theatre with electric lighting.

The wealth of the neighborhood peaked between World War I and World War II, even when events such as Prohibition and the Great Depression were taking place. After World War I, the German enclave was steadily replaced by a significant proportion of Italian Americans. By 1950, Bushwick was one of New York City&#x27;s largest Italian American neighborhoods, although some German Americans remained.
The Italian community was composed almost entirely of Sicilians, mostly from the Palermo, Trapani, and Agrigento provinces in Sicily. In particular, the Sicilian townsfolk of Menfi, Santa Margherita di Belice, Trapani, Castelvetrano, and many other &quot;paesi&quot; had their own clubs (&quot;clubbu&quot;) in the area. &quot;Il Circolo di Santa Margherita di Belice&quot;, founded in Bushwick, remains the oldest operating Sicilian organization in the United States. These clubs often started as mutual benevolence associations or funeral societies. They transformed along with the needs of their communities from the late 1800s until the 1960s, when many began to fade away.

St. Joseph Patron of the Universal Church Roman Catholic Parish was the hub of the Sicilian community, and held five feasts during the year, complete with processions of saints or Our Lady of Trapani. St. Joseph opened in 1923 because the Italian community had been rapidly growing in Bushwick since 1900. This Sicilian community first was centered in Our Lady of Pompeii parish on Siegel Street in Williamsburgh.

As industry expanded along Flushing Avenue, the Sicilian population expanded with the growing need for labor by factory operators. St. Leonard&#x27;s parish was the large German Catholic parish in the area, but the Italian community was not welcome there and was thus compelled to open its own parish. St. Leonard&#x27;s closed in 1973. St. Joseph&#x27;s is now a large and vibrant Latino parish run by the Scalabrini Order of priests, an Italian missionary order that caters to migrants.

===Postwar transition and decline===
The demographic transition of Bushwick after World War II was similar to that of many Brooklyn neighborhoods. The U.S. Census records show that the neighborhood&#x27;s population was almost 90% white in 1960, but dropped to less than 40% white by 1970. During this transition, white-collar workers were being replaced by those migrating from the south. Puerto Ricans, African Americans, among other Caribbean American families, moved into homes in the southeastern edge of the neighborhood, closest to Eastern Parkway. By the mid-1950s, migrants began settling into central Bushwick. The availability of block association housing helped many neighborhoods survive the economic and social distress of the 1970s.

This change in demographics coincided with changes in the local economy. Rising energy costs, advances in transportation and the change to the use of aluminum cans encouraged beer companies to move out of New York City. As breweries in Bushwick closed, the neighborhood&#x27;s economic base eroded. Discussions of urban renewal took place in the 1960s, but never materialized, resulting in the demolition of many residential buildings with the intent of replacing these structures with public housing, but nothing new was built in its place as these proposals were scrapped. Another contribution to the change in the socioeconomic profile of the neighborhood was the John Lindsay administration&#x27;s policy of raising available rent for welfare recipients. Since these tenants could now bring higher rents than tenants would on the open market, landlords began filling vacant units with such tenants. By the mid-1970s, half of Bushwick&#x27;s residents were on public assistance.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bushwick was &quot;a neatly maintained community of wood houses&quot; by the mid-1960s. Within five years, it had become &quot;what often approached a no man&#x27;s land of abandoned buildings, empty lots, drugs and arson.&quot;
On the night of July 13, 1977, a major blackout cut power to nearly all of New York City, and arson, looting, and vandalism occurred in low-income neighborhoods across the city. Bushwick suffered some of the most devastating damage and losses. While store owners along Knickerbocker and Graham avenues were able to defend their stores, the Broadway shopping district was heavily looted and burned. Twenty-seven stores along Broadway were burned, and looters and some residents saw the blackout as an opportunity to get what they otherwise could not afford.

Newspapers around the country published UPI and the Associated Press&#x27;s photos of Bushwick residents with stolen items and a police officer beating a suspected looter, and Bushwick became known for riots and looting. Fires spread to many residential buildings as well. After the riots were over and the fires were put out, residents saw unsafe dwellings and empty lots among surviving buildings, leading one author to describe the scene as &quot;some streets that looked like Brooklyn Heights, and others that looked like Dresden in 1945&quot;: The business vacancy rate on Broadway reached 43% in the wake of the riots.

The 1977 blackout and resulting riots left Bushwick without a commercial retail hub. Middle-class residents who could afford to leave did so, in some cases abandoning their homes. New immigrants continued to move to the area, many from Hispanic America, but renovation and new construction was outpaced by the demolition of unsafe buildings, forcing overcrowded conditions at first. As buildings came down, the vacant lots made parts of the neighborhood look and feel desolate, resulting in a greater outflow of residents and a growth of the illegal drug trade due to a lack of job opportunities.

Author Jonathan Mahler described the social and economic hardships of Bushwick after the blackout in his book &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx is Burning&quot;, explaining that the majority of neighborhood residents were living on less than $4,000 a year, and had to rely on some form of public assistance. By the 1980s, the Knickerbocker Avenue shopping district was nicknamed &quot;The Well&quot; for its seemingly unending supply of drugs. Even through the 1990s, it remained a poor and relatively dangerous area, with 77 murders, 80 rapes, and 2,242 robberies in 1990.

===Gentrification===
Since 2000, the rise of real estate prices in nearby Manhattan has made Bushwick more attractive to younger professionals. In the wake of reduced crime rates citywide and a shortage of affordable housing in nearby neighborhoods such as Park Slope and Williamsburg, numerous young professionals and artists have moved into converted warehouse lofts, brownstones, limestone-brick townhouses, and other renovated buildings in Bushwick.

A flourishing artist community has existed in Bushwick for decades and has become more visible in the neighborhood. Dozens of art studios and galleries are scattered throughout the neighborhood. Several open studios programs are conducted that enable the public to visit artist studios and galleries, and several websites are devoted to promoting neighborhood art and events. Bushwick artists display their works in galleries and private spaces throughout the neighborhood. The borough&#x27;s first and only trailer park, a 20-person art collective established by founder, Hayden Cummings and ZenoRadio&#x27;s Baruch Herzfeld, was established within a former nut roasting factory for live/work spaces. A Bushwick-centered news site, entitled &quot;Bushwick Daily&quot;, was founded in 2010 by Katarina Hybenova, and features community issues, events, food, art and culture.

Starting in the mid-2000s, the city and state governments began the Bushwick Initiative, a two-year pilot program spearheaded by the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) and various community projects. The group&#x27;s goal was to improve quality of life in the twenty-three square blocks surrounding Maria Hernandez Park through various programs such as addressing deteriorated housing conditions, increasing economic development opportunities, and reducing drug dealing activities. The group&#x27;s crime-reduction activities included collaboration with the HPD&#x27;s Narcotics Control Unit and the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 83rd Precinct and Narcotics Division to reduce drug-dealing.

To reduce lead hazards in buildings, HPD and DOHMH created a grant program focusing on residential buildings in the initiative&#x27;s coverage area, which resulted in fines for dozens of landlords with lead paint hazards. The Bushwick Initiative&#x27;s economic development efforts were also focused on revitalizing the Knickerbocker Avenue commercial district, and adding a thousand rat-resistant public trash cans to reduce litter.

In 2019, the New York City Department of City Planning released a Bushwick rezoning plan covering 300 city blocks. The plan would allow for high-density development on Broadway and Myrtle and Wyckoff Avenues.

==Demographics==

The entirety of Community Board 4 had 112,388 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 80.4 years. This is lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are middle-aged adults and youth: 24% are between the ages of 0–17, 35% between 25 and 44, and 20% between 45 and 64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 12% and 9% respectively.

As of 2016, the median household income in Community Board 4 was $50,656. In 2018, an estimated 25% of Bushwick residents lived in poverty, compared to 21% in all of Brooklyn and 20% in all of New York City. One in eight residents (13%) were unemployed, compared to 9% in the rest of both Brooklyn and New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 55% in Bushwick, higher than the citywide and boroughwide rates of 52% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Bushwick is considered to be gentrifying.

Though an ethnic neighborhood, Bushwick&#x27;s population is, for a New York City neighborhood, relatively heterogeneous, scoring a 0.5 on the Furman Center&#x27;s racial diversity index, making it the city&#x27;s 35th most diverse neighborhood in 2007. Most residents are Latino American citizens from the island of Puerto Rico and immigrants from the Dominican Republic. Since the turn of the 21st century, the population of native-born Americans has increased, as have other Latino groups, particularly immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador.

In 2008 the neighborhood&#x27;s median household income was $28,802. 32% of the population falls under the poverty line, making Bushwick the 7th-most impoverished neighborhood in New York City. More than 75% of children in the neighborhood are born in poverty. Some 40.3% of students in Bushwick read at grade level in 2007, making it the 49th most literate neighborhood in the city that year. 58.2% of students could work math at grade level in Bushwick, and it ranked as 41st in the city.

Bushwick is the most populous Hispanic-American community in Brooklyn, although Sunset Park also has a large Hispanic population. As in other neighborhoods in New York City, Bushwick&#x27;s Hispanic population is mainly from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. It also has a sizable population from South American nations. As nearly 70% of Bushwick&#x27;s population is Hispanic, residents have created many businesses to support their various national and distinct traditions in food and other items. The neighborhood&#x27;s major commercial streets are Knickerbocker Avenue, Myrtle Avenue, Wyckoff Avenue, and Broadway.

===Neighborhood tabulation areas===

West Bushwick had between 30,000 to 39,999 Hispanic residents and 10,000 to 19,999 White residents, meanwhile the Black and Asian populations were each under 5000 residents. East Bushwick had between 30,000 to 39,999 Hispanic residents, 10,000 to 19,999 White residents, and 5,000 to 9,999 Black residents while the Asian residents were less than 5000. 

=== Puerto Rican and Dominican communities ===
Bushwick and neighboring East New York are the center for the Hispanic community in Brooklyn. In the post-World War II period, Bushwick was still a predominantly Irish and Italian-American community. Puerto Ricans began to migrate to New York for greater opportunities, developing Hispanic enclaves in Brooklyn, East Harlem, the Lower East Side or Loisaida, and the Bronx. Many Puerto Ricans also settled in neighboring Williamsburg, also known as &quot;Los Sures&quot;, due to the proximity to jobs at the now defunct Domino Sugar Refinery as well as at the Brooklyn Navy Yard; they expanded into other parts of Brooklyn as many ethnic Irish and some Italians moved to nearby Queens (such as Ridgewood and Middle Village).

Salsa music, corner bodegas, and Latin cuisine are part of the cultural dynamic of the Bushwick community. The neighborhood contains the largest concentration of Hispanic Americans in the entire borough, followed closely behind by Sunset Park. The Williamsburg and Bushwick communities are home to their own local Puerto Rican Day Parade. The parade board usually meets at the Orocovis Social Club, located off Myrtle Avenue. La Isla Restaurant, located off Myrtle Avenue and Knickerbocker, is popular for its Puerto Rican and Dominican cuisine. On the corner of Broadway, Flushing Avenue and Graham Avenue, where Bushwick, Williamsburg and Bedford–Stuyvesant meet, in the shadow of Woodhull Medical Center, Graham Avenue becomes the Avenue of Puerto Rico.

A campus of Boricua College and a branch of the Puerto Rico-based Popular Community Bank are located within the Bushwick area. Make the Road New York, a Latino community group, has a chapter in the neighborhood. So important is the activism of local Latinos that in 2016, Democratic Party presidential candidate Bernie Sanders campaigned in Bushwick in order to reach Hispanic votes. A web show, &quot;East Willy B&quot;, was created to explore the struggles of the local Latino community.

==Housing==

The United States Postal Service operates three post offices in Bushwick: the Wyckoff Heights Station at 86 Wyckoff Avenue, the Bushwick Station at 1369 Broadway, and the Halsey Station at 805 MacDonough Street.

===Border with Ridgewood===

Bushwick&#x27;s land area lies within Kings County (Brooklyn), but shares a political boundary with Queens to the northeast. Previously, the boundary had caused confusion and debate about whether the Queens neighborhood of Ridgewood was also located partly in Brooklyn. The political dispute dates to the 17th century, when Newtown, Queens (now Elmhurst) was under English rule and Boswijck was under Dutch rule. Disputes over the boundary between the two settlements continued until 1769, when a boundary line was drawn through what later became known as the Arbitration Rock.

The street grid plan in Ridgewood and Bushwick was laid out in the late 19th century. Because the Arbitration Rock lay along a diagonal with this grid plan, numerous houses were built on the Brooklyn-Queens boundary, their owners sometimes subject to taxes from both counties. During the 19th century, this resulted in situations where some houses received water and fire protection from what was then the city of Brooklyn, while their neighbors in Queens had to rely on volunteer firefighting squads and paid exorbitant water bills to private utilities in Elmhurst.

In 1925, the political boundary was adapted to the street grid, resulting in a zig-zag pattern. The change resulted in 2,543 persons&#x27; addresses being reassigned from Queens to Brooklyn, and 135 persons&#x27; addresses reassigned from Brooklyn to Queens. Modern addresses in the two boroughs can be distinguished by the presence or absence of a hyphen in the house number. Queens&#x27;s house numbering system uses a hyphen between the closest cross-street (which comes before the hyphen) and the actual address (which comes after the hyphen). Streets in this area that run northeast–southwest, perpendicular to the county line, are demarcated by a jump in numbering sequence between the two boroughs. However, several avenues running northwest–southeast within Queens, parallel to the county line, follow the Brooklyn house numbering system.

=== ZIP Code changes ===
When ZIP Codes were assigned in 1963, all areas whose mail was routed through a Brooklyn post office were given the 112 prefix. The neighboring areas of Glendale and Ridgewood in Queens were given a Brooklyn mailing address, 11227, shared with Bushwick. In addition, part of Bushwick was in ZIP Code 11237. After the 1977 blackout, the communities of Ridgewood and Glendale expressed a desire to disassociate themselves from Bushwick.

Following complaints from residents, Postmaster General William Bolger proposed that the ZIP Codes would be changed if United States Representative Geraldine Ferraro could produce evidence that 70% of residents supported it. After Ferraro&#x27;s office distributed ballots to residents, 93 percent of the returned ballots voted for the change. The change of the Queens side to ZIP Code 11385 was made effective January 13, 1980. 11237 was reassigned to cover only Bushwick, and 11227 was eliminated.

The Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Evergreen Branch used to run from northwest to southeast through Bushwick. The branch opened in 1878, though passenger service on the branch ended in 1896. However, the Evergreen Branch continued to be used as a freight branch until it was abandoned in 1984. Since then, the route of the former railroad branch have been developed, converted to parking lots, or lain vacant.

During the 1960s, under the direction of Robert Moses, there were plans to build an extension of Interstate 78 through Bushwick, to connect lower Manhattan with the South Shore of Long Island. The extension was to be called the Bushwick Expressway, but was never built, due to then Mayor John V. Lindsay&#x27;s concerns that traffic leaving Manhattan should bypass it via the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and the project was formally killed by Governor Nelson Rockefeller in 1971.

In 2010, 68% of residents used public transportation, up from 59% in 2000. Almost all residents (96%) live within of the subway.

<text>Anzac Cove () is a small cove on the Gallipoli peninsula in Turkey. It became famous as the site of World War I landing of the ANZACs (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) on 25 April 1915. The cove is long, bounded by the headlands of &quot;Arıburnu&quot; to the north and Little Arıburnu, known as Hell Spit, to the south. Following the landing at Anzac Cove, the beach became the main base for the Australian and New Zealand troops for the eight months of the Gallipoli campaign.

==Gallipoli campaign, 1915–1916==
The first objective for soldiers coming ashore in enemy-held territory was to establish a beachhead, a safe section of beach protected from enemy attack where supplies and extra troops could be safely brought ashore.

Anzac Cove was always within of the front-line, well within the range of Turkish artillery, though spurs from the high ground of Plugge&#x27;s Plateau, which rose above Arıburnu, provided some protection. General William Birdwood, commander of Anzac, made his headquarters in a gully overlooking the cove, as did the commanders of the New Zealand and Australian Division and the Australian 1st Division. On 29 April, General Birdwood recommended that the original landing site between the two headlands be known as &quot;Anzac Cove&quot; and that the surrounding, hitherto nameless, area occupied by his corps be known as &quot;Anzac&quot;.

The beach itself became an enormous supply dump and two field hospitals were established, one at either end. Four floating jetties were quickly constructed for the landing of stores, later replaced in July by a permanent structure known as &quot;Watson&#x27;s Pier&quot;. The volume of stores quickly overflowed onto the adjacent beaches; firstly onto Brighton Beach to the south of the cove and later onto North Beach beyond Arıburnu. Three wireless radio stations were established on the beach to maintain contact with the fleet.

While the cove was relatively sheltered from shellfire from across the peninsula, the Chanak forts, as well as the Turkish battleships &quot;Turgut Reis&quot; and &quot;Barbaros Hayreddin&quot; anchored in the Dardanelles, shelled the waters off the cove and it was partially exposed to view from Gaba Tepe to the south and completely open to view from Nibrunesi Point at the southern tip of Suvla Bay to the north. Nibrunesi Point was under the guns of the Royal Navy so was never used to fire on Anzac, however the well-concealed Turkish battery at Gaba Tepe, known as &quot;Beachy Bill&quot;, was a constant menace.

Private Victor Laidlaw wrote of the dangers posed by Beachy Bill in his diary:


Despite the shelling and Turkish snipers, Anzac Cove was a popular swimming beach for the soldiers. At ANZAC it was a struggle to supply sufficient water for drinking and there was rarely any available for washing. Most soldiers disregarded all but the fiercest shelling rather than interrupt the one luxury available to them.

==Commemorations==
On Anzac Day in 1985, the name &quot;Anzac Cove&quot; was officially recognised by the Turkish government. The Anzac Day dawn service was held at Arıburnu Cemetery within the cove until 1999 when the number of people attending outgrew the site. A purpose-built &quot;Anzac Commemorative Site&quot; was constructed nearby on North Beach in time for the 2000 service.

Over the years, Anzac Cove beach has been degraded by erosion, and the construction of the coast road from Kabatepe to Suvla, originally started by Australian engineers just prior to the evacuation of Anzac in December 1915, resulted in the beach being further reduced and bounded by a steep earth embankment. The only way onto the beach was via the Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries at each headland, Arıburnu Cemetery, and Beach Cemetery.

In 2003 the Australian government announced that it was negotiating with Turkey to place Anzac Cove on the National Heritage List, which included Australian sites such as the Eureka Stockade gardens. However this request was dismissed by the Turkish government as the Gallipoli peninsula is Turkish territory and already a national park in the Turkish National Park System. In 2004 the Australian Minister for Veteran&#x27;s Affairs, Danna Vale, made a request to the Turkish authorities that roadworks be carried out in the area. In 2005, the resultant efforts to widen the road to provide a bus parking area for the Commemorative Site covered some of the remaining beach, making it impossible to traverse, and cut into Plugge&#x27;s Plateau, making the path to the summit and Plugge&#x27;s Plateau Cemetery impassable.

On 18 October 2005 the federal minister for veterans affairs, Danna Vale, called for the battlefield to be recreated in Australia, saying that the physical similarity between the end of the Mornington Peninsula, in Victoria, and Anzac Cove, in Turkey, is &quot;uncanny&quot;.

<doc id="742927" wikidata="Q2327110" url="?curid=742927" title="New Spring">
<text>New Spring is a fantasy novel by American author Robert Jordan, a prequel in the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series. &quot;New Spring&quot; consists of 26 chapters and an epilogue.

==Background to publication==
&quot;New Spring&quot; was originally published as a novella in the speculative fiction anthology edited by Robert Silverberg entitled &quot;Legends: Short Novels by the Masters of Modern Fantasy&quot;, released on 25 August 1998, just before the 1998 publication of &quot;The Path of Daggers&quot; (Book 8 of &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot;). Jordan later expanded the novella into a standalone novel (though of significantly shorter length than typical &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; books), which was then published by Tor Books in January 2004, between the 2003 publication of &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot; (Book 10) and the 2005 publication of &quot;Knife of Dreams&quot; (Book 11).

The &quot;New Spring&quot; novel was originally conceived of as the first in a trilogy of prequel novels. The second and third were to focus on Tam serving in the Illianer army and finding Rand, and Moiraine and Lan&#x27;s journeys and discoveries to reach the Two Rivers just before the events of the first novel. Jordan&#x27;s original plan was to write the trilogy before books 11 and 12 of the main series, but he was disappointed with &quot;New Spring&quot;&#x27;s reception and decided to postpone this until after the main series was completed. However, his death on 16 September 2007—before the completion of the final novel in the series—makes this highly unlikely.

The first paperback edition of &quot;New Spring&quot;, released on 13 June 2005, gave readers the first look at &quot;Knife of Dreams&quot; (Book 11), as it featured an advance excerpt of part of the prologue of &quot;Knife of Dreams&quot;.

==Plot summary==

Twenty years before the beginning of the series Gitara Moroso, the Keeper of the Chronicles, foretells that the Dragon has been reborn. Moiraine, Siuan and the Amyrlin Seat Tamra Ospenya are the only people to witness it. Tamra decides to give a bounty to every woman who gave birth in the camps around Tar Valon during the last week to get a list of babies who could possibly be the Dragon Reborn. Initially, Moiraine and Siuan go with the other Accepted to record names of candidates for the bounty, but the following day are told to spend their time copying some of the less-legible lists, which gives them the opportunity to create their own list of babies who could be the Dragon Reborn.

Tamra orders Moiraine to give a letter to Aes Sedai Kerene Nagashi asking her to meet the Amyrlin. Other Aes Sedai receive similar summons, leading Moiraine and Siuan to believe they are being sent out to search for the Dragon Reborn. The sisters who had been summoned leave Tar Valon, and after, Tamra is found dead.

After Moiraine and Siuan are raised to Aes Sedai, Moiraine leaves Tar Valon to search for the Dragon Reborn herself. She travels to the city of Canluun, where she meets Merean Redhill (Tamra’s Mistress of Novices) and the fabled Aes Sedai Cadsuane. Siuan meets her there and informs her that all the Aes Sedai Tamra sent out of the Tower are dead, leading them to believe the Black Ajah is attempting to thwart their hunt for the Dragon Reborn.

As the Aiel War ends, Lan rides to Canluun with his companion Bukama, where he meets a friend of his called Ryne. Ryne tells them that Lan’s carneira (first lover) Edeyn Arrel, intends to raise Malkier’s banner of the Golden Crane, summoning the nation’s remaining people to ride back to try to reclaim their home. The three decide to ride to Edeyn in Chacin to disuade her.

Moiraine, also riding from Canluun to Chacin, encounters Lan’s group on the road. She initially keeps her distance, following them from behind as she is suspicious of them. She meets the group, and claims the right of a woman alone to be escorted to Chacin to meet one of the mothers on her list. They agree, though Lan is suspicious of her and believes that she has been sent by Edeyn.

The group arrive at Chacin. Moiraine meets with Siuan again, who has located the next mother on their list, Ines, in the Aesdaishar Palace. Lan, Bukama and Ryne immediately go to the Aesdaishar Palace where they meet Brys, Prince-Consort to Queen Ethenielle of Kandor. Moiraine enters the palace and uses her noble lineage to get her and Siuan a room there.

Lan meets Edeyn, who attempts to persuade Lan to become the King of Malkier, though she fails, and tells him that she plans for him to marry her daughter Iselle, in which Lan has little choice as, with no living relatives, his carneira has the right to arrange his marriage. 

In the Palace, Moiraine is avoiding encountering Lan. She runs into Merean in the Palace and, suspicious she may be Black Ajah, Moiraine finally talks to Lan and asks him and Bakuma to spy on Merean for her. Iselle asks Moiraine to enroll her at the White Tower but Moiraine dismisses her. Bakuma later tells Siuan that Merean had a meeting with Brys.

Learning that Edeyn intends to marry Lan to Iselle soon, Lan searches for Bukuma so they can flee. As he does so, his feet are pulled from under him with the One Power and he falls down a flight of stairs. A servant then tells Lan that Bakuma has been stabbed, and he finds Bakuma dead in his room. Angry, Lan goes to find Moiraine and tells her what has happened. 

Lan blames Bakuma’s death on Aes Sedai schemes. Moiraine, now sure Merean is of the Black Ajah, realises that everyone’s in danger. They rush to find Merean, and reach a large balcony where they find Ryne and Merean, who has trapped Iselle, Brys and Diryk (the Queen’s son) with Air. They discover Iselle brought the other two to Merean believing she would take her to the White Tower afterwards, that Ryne is a Darkfriend, and that he killed Bakuma for spying on Merean. A fight ensues, and Lan kills Ryne and Moiraine kills Merean, but not before Merean kills Brys, Diryk, and Iselle.

Moiraine incinerates Merean’s and Ryne’s corpses, as the White Tower would be disgraced if the Black Ajah were found to be real. Siuan finds that Ines’ son was born in a farmhouse, and so cannot be the Dragon Reborn. They realise that Merean’s target was Diryk as they thought his luck might be because he was the Dragon Reborn. This gives them hope, as they realise the Black Ajah have less information about the Dragon Reborn’s identity than them.

They decide that Siuan will return to White Tower and use the Blue Ajah’s spy network to gather intel regarding the Black Ajah and the Dragon Reborn’s identity while Moiraine continues searching. Moiraine finds Lan and asks him to be her Warder. Lan agrees, and she bonds him.

==Graphic novel==
It is also the first of Jordan&#x27;s works to be adapted to graphic novel format. Issue #1 was published in July 2005. It ran eight issues total. It was produced by DB Pro, who previously adapted &quot;The Legend of Huma&quot; by Richard A. Knaak and &quot;The Hedge Knight&quot; by George R. R. Martin and published by Red Eagle Entertainment.

The comics are adapted by Chuck Dixon, drawn by Mike S. Miller, colored by Etienne St Laurent, edited by Ernst Dabel, lettered by Artmonkeys, with design by Bill Tortolini.

All eight issues were collected and re-released together as a single graphic novel in January 2011. It includes extra bonus material of developmental art, script pages, and correspondence between Jordan and Dixon.

<text>Robert Shankland (10 October 1887 – 20 January 1968) was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

== Early life ==
Born in Ayr, Scotland, on 10 October 1887, Robert Shankland was the son of a railroad guard, and his first job was that of a clerk in the stationmaster&#x27;s office. He moved to Canada in 1910 where he worked as assistant cashier for the Crescent Creamery Company in Winnipeg. When World War I broke out he joined the 43rd Battalion (Cameron Highlanders of Canada) CEF as a private.

==Victoria Cross==
Awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions at Sanctuary Wood in 1916 as a Sergeant (in charge of a stretcher bearer party), Shankland received a battlefield commission later that year and continued to serve with the 43rd Bn as an officer. On the morning of 26 October, he led his platoon of 40 men from D Company (D Company commanded by Capt. Galt) to the crest of the hill at the Bellevue Spur, the main trench line defending the approach to Passchendaele. Overrunning it and holding the position was critical to capturing the town. Early in the advance, B Company captured and held the Spur.

On the right, the 58th Bn, which was under heavy fire from Snipe Hill, was forced to retire after failing to reach its objective. Some of the men joined Shankland&#x27;s platoon, but this still left his right flank open. For four hours they withstood incessant artillery shelling and German counterattacks, sustaining frightful casualties. By this time the 8th Brigade on the left was forced to withdraw leaving both of Shankland&#x27;s flanks exposed.

He and his men were in danger of being cut off and losing the vital position gained at such fearful cost. The only solution was to bring up reinforcements and counterattack. Shankland turned over his command to another officer and then weaved his way through heavy mud and German shelling to battalion headquarters where he gave a first-hand report of the situation. He also offered a detailed plan on how a counterattack with reinforcements could best be achieved. He then returned to his men to lead the forthcoming attack supported by reinforcements from the 52nd and 58th battalions. For his actions that day Robert Shankland was awarded the Victoria Cross.

His citation reads: 

==Later life==
Following the war, Shankland stayed in the Canadian Militia with the Cameron Highlanders and in his civilian work served as secretary-manager for several Winnipeg firms. He eventually moved to Victoria and joined the Canadian Scottish Regiment. When the Second World War started, he returned to Winnipeg and rejoined the Camerons. Now a Major, he went overseas with the battalion as Officer Commanding Headquarters Company. Due to his age (53) he was too old for combat duty. Promoted to lieutenant colonel, Shankland was appointed camp commandant of the Canadian Army Detention Barracks in England in December 1940.

According to the May/June 2005 issue of the Legion Magazine, &quot;in 1946, Shankland took his discharge and became secretary of a leading securities firm in Vancouver. He died 20 January 1968, at Shaughnessy, Vancouver, and his body was cremated and his ashes (allegedly) scattered in the grounds of Vancouver&#x27;s Mountain View Cemetery.&quot;

==Legacy==
Frederick William Hall, Leo Clarke, and Robert Shankland all lived on Pine Street in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It is believed to be the only street in the world to have three Victoria Cross recipients who lived there. The city later renamed it &quot;Valour Road&quot; in their honour. A bronze plaque is mounted on a street lamp at the corner of Portage Ave and Valour Road to tell this story.

===The medal===

The medal was on public display at the Manitoba Museum in Winnipeg, Manitoba commencing 6 August 2014, on loan from the Canadian War Museum as part of a display celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada. Shankland&#x27;s battledress blouse with ribbons and his miniatures are on display in The Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada Museum at Minto Armoury in Winnipeg.

The medal was placed on auction on 25 May 2009. Despite public outrage of its sale from an anonymous seller, controversy was averted when the Canadian War Museum purchased the medal at auction for $240,000 in order to keep it in Canadian public hands forever.

<doc id="742950" wikidata="Q218312" url="?curid=742950" title="Agami heron">
<text>The agami heron (Agamia agami) is a medium-sized heron. It is a resident breeding bird from Central America south to Peru and Brazil. It is sometimes known as the chestnut-bellied heron, and is the only member of the genus &quot;Agamia&quot;. In Brazil it is sometimes called &quot;Soco beija-flor&quot;, meaning &#x27;hummingbird heron&#x27;, thanks to its unique coloration pattern.

The agami heron is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN, due to predictions of future habitat destruction within its range.

==Taxonomy==
The agami heron was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the herons and cranes in the genus &quot;Ardea&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Ardea agami&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Agami heron&quot; from Cayenne that had been described in 1785 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his book &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Latham had in turn based his description on a specimen owned by the army officer Thamas Davies and the description and illustration of &quot;Le Héron Agami&quot; by the French polymath Comte de Buffon in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot;. The agami heron is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Agamia&quot; that was introduced in 1853 by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach. The name &quot;agami&quot; is the word for Grey-winged trumpeter that&#x27;s used by the indigenous people of French Guiana. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==

This uncommon species is in length. It is short-legged for a heron, and has a thin bill which is considerably longer than the head. The neck and underparts are chestnut, with a white line down the centre of the foreneck, and the wings are shiny green. Wispy pale blue feathers decorate the crown, sides of the foreneck, and lower back. The legs, bill, and bare facial patch are dull yellow. During the breeding season the facial patch can change color to reddish. The sexes are similar, but juveniles are largely brown above with a white foreneck, and streaked brown-and-white underparts. The normal clutch size is two blue eggs.

The species has a 15 cm long bill, which has been described as extremely long, allowing it to strike prey from greater distances from its body than similarly sized heron species sporting shorter bills.

==Distribution and habitat==

The agami heron is a Neotropical species occurring in Central and South America. The distribution area of the species extends from south-east Mexico through central and Caribbean Central America through the Amazon basin in South America, covering the following countries: Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Suriname, Guyana, Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil.

This species is rare in open areas. The agami heron&#x27;s habitat encompasses swamp forests, mangroves, forest streams and freshwater wetlands. They mostly occur at elevations between sea level and , although records exist from as elevations as high as in the Andes. They nest in both single species and mixed species colonies on platforms of sticks in bushes and trees over water. Very few colonies are known to date but some are quite large, up to hundreds or even over a thousand nests. The following locations of colonies are known within the distribution area of the species:on a tiny island at the centre of a lagoon in the middle of the Pacuare Nature Reserve, Costa Rica, in the Tapiche Reserve, Peru, the Marais de Kaw-Roura National Reserve and Amazonian National Park, French Guiana, and other colonies outside of protected areas in Colombia, Mexico and Belize.

==Behavior==

Despite its stunning plumage, this reclusive species&#x27; preference for shade and overhanging vegetation means that it is rarely seen. This is a quiet bird, but pairs and family groups may make various snoring or rattling sounds. Rattling sounds and slow walking away are a typical response to disturbance.

Agami herons stalk their prey (fish, frogs, small reptiles, and snails) in shallow shaded water in forested areas. They often stand still on perches or directly in the water, or moving very slowly. They rarely wade in open water. At Cocha Cashu, a 1985 study found that 52% of their prey during the late dry season consisted of characids, particularly &quot;Triportheus angulatus&quot; and &quot;Astyanax&quot; sp., which are surface-swimming fishes. Prey mostly measured 2-10 cm in length. Less commonly, they have also been known to consume cichlids (&quot;Aequidens&quot;).

Several courtship behaviors have been described and are used by both sexes. Lores can change color to an intense red, and both sexes show a short-lived silver crest. 

== Conservation ==
This species is very discreet and scientifically little known, which is a challenge for conservationists. Its remote habitat and secretive behavior may explain its apparent rarity. However, it is considered as near threatened by the IUCN Red List due to future habitat loss in the Amazon. Conservation efforts should concentrate on protection of important colony sites, developing a better understanding of the range, habitat needs and biology of the species.

<doc id="742964" wikidata="Q3445429" url="?curid=742964" title="List of religious populations">
<text>The list of religious populations article provides a comprehensive overview of the distribution and size of religious groups around the world. This article aims to present statistical information on the number of adherents to various religions, including major faiths such as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and others, as well as smaller religious communities. It also includes the percentage of nonreligious and atheistic populations. 

The data is primarily sourced from organizations like the Pew Research Center, global surveys, census reports, and research studies, offering insights into the demographic composition of religious affiliations across different regions and countries. The list also explores trends in religious growth, decline, and shifts, reflecting the dynamic nature of religious adherence in the global context.

== Current world estimates ==
Pew Research Center made its &quot;Population Growth Projections, 2010–2050&quot; based on 2010 baseline estimates. New estimates for 2020 are still work in progress. Their methodology is published as an appendix.

Data is ranked by mean estimate in parentheses. Irreligious includes agnostic, atheist, secular people, and those having no formal religious adherence. It does not necessarily mean that those of this group don&#x27;t belong to any religion. Some religions have harmonized with local cultures and can be seen as a cultural background rather than a formal religion. Additionally, the practice of officially associating a family or household with a religion, while not formally practicing the affiliated religion, is common in many countries. Thus, over half of this group is theistic and/or influenced by religious principles, but nonreligious/non-practicing and not true atheists or agnostics. See &quot;Spiritual but not religious&quot;.

===Chinese traditional religionists===

As a spiritual practice, Taoism has made fewer inroads in the West than Buddhism and Hinduism. Despite the popularity of its great classics the &quot;I Ching&quot; and the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, the practice of Taoism has not been promulgated in America with much success; these religions are not ubiquitous worldwide in the way that adherents of bigger world religions are, and they remain primarily an ethnic religion. Nonetheless, Taoist ideas and symbols such as &quot;taijitu&quot; have become popular throughout the world through tai chi, qigong, and various martial arts.

The Chinese traditional religion has 184,000 believers in Latin America, 250,000 believers in Europe, and 839,000 believers in North America .

===Ethnic and indigenous religionists===
Indigenous statistics come from the U.S. Department of State&#x27;s International Religious Freedom Act (2009), based on the highest estimate of people identified as indigenous or followers of indigenous religions that have been well-defined. Due to the syncretic nature of these religions, the numbers may not reflect the actual number of practitioners.

The Sikh homeland is the Punjab state, in India, where Sikhs make up approximately 58% of the population. This is the only place where Sikhs are in the majority. Sikhs have emigrated to countries all over the world – especially to English-speaking and East Asian nations. In doing so they have retained, to an unusually high degree, their distinctive cultural and religious identity.
Sikhs are not ubiquitous worldwide in the way that adherents of larger world religions are, and they remain primarily an ethnic religion. But they can be found in many international cities and have become an especially strong religious presence in the United Kingdom and Canada. Sikhism is also the fastest growing religion in New Zealand and Australia.

<text>Cuacuauhtzin (c. 1410–1443) was an Aztec poet, composing in the Nahuatl language, and lord of Tepechpan. Born around the year 1410, Cuacuauhtzin became lord when his father, Tencoyotzin died at a young age.

As lord, he led his people to battle several times. The spoils from these exploits increased the prosperity of his town and were used to decorate his palace more lavishly.

After giving a large gift to an important Mexica named Temictzin, Cuacuauhtzin married that man&#x27;s daughter, Azcalxóchitzin, in the year 12-Flint (1440). Because Azcalxóchitzin was so young, Cuacuauhtzin did not immediately consummate their marriage. After their marriage, Nezahualcoyotl, &quot;tlatoani&quot; of Texcoco, fell in love with Azcalxóchitzin and sent Cuacuauhtzin to the war against Tlaxcala. At Nezahualcoyotl&#x27;s command, Cuacuauhtzin was ordered into the midst of the most dangerous fighting, so that he would be killed and Nezahualcoyotl could marry Azcalxóchitzin. Cuacuauhtzin found out this plot before he left for war and composed what is known as the &quot;Song of Sadness&quot; or &quot;Sad Song.&quot; Addressed to a gathering of close friends, the poem deals with the betrayal of his lord and friend, Nezahualcoyotl, and the certainty of death: &quot;Where would we go/that we never have to die?&quot; He makes apostrophe to Nezahualcoyotl by means of an epithet, Yoyontzin or &quot;Panting One&quot;.

He died in the year 3-Reed (1443) in battle against the Tlaxcalans. His biography is given by Ixlilxochitl. His songs appear in three different places in extant collections of Pre-Columbian work.

<doc id="743006" wikidata="Q270727" url="?curid=743006" title="Masahiko Kimura">
<text>was a Japanese judoka and professional wrestler. He won the All-Japan Judo Championships three times in a row for the first time in history and had never lost a judo match from 1936 to 1950. In submission grappling, the reverse ude-garami arm lock is often called the &quot;Kimura&quot;, due to his famous victory over Gracie jiu-jitsu co-founder Hélio Gracie. In the Japanese professional wrestling world, he is known for being one of Japan&#x27;s earliest stars and the controversial match he had with Rikidōzan.
==Biography==
Kimura was born on September 10, 1917, in Kumamoto, Japan. Masahiko Kimura began training judo at the age of 9 and was promoted to yondan (4th dan) at the age of 15. He had defeated six opponents (who were all 3rd and 4th dan) in a row. In 1935, at age 18 he became the youngest ever godan (5th degree black belt) when he defeated eight consecutive opponents at Kodokan (headquarters for the worldwide judo community).
Kimura&#x27;s remarkable success can in part be attributed to his fanatical training regimen, managed by his teacher, Tatsukuma Ushijima. Kimura
reportedly lost only four judo matches in his lifetime, all occurring in 1935. He considered quitting judo after those losses, but through the encouragement of friends he began training again. He consistently practiced the leg throw osoto gari (large outer reap) against a tree. Daily randori or sparring sessions at Tokyo Police and Kodokan dōjōs resulted in numerous opponents suffering from concussions and losing consciousness. Many opponents asked Kimura not to use his osoto gari.

At the height of his career, Kimura&#x27;s training involved a thousand push-ups and nine hours of practice every day. He won the All-Japan Judo Championships, an openweight competition, for three straight years in 1937, 1938, and 1939. He was promoted to 7th dan at age 30, a rank that was frozen after disputes with Kodokan over becoming a professional wrestler, refusing to return the All Japan Judo Championship flag, and issuing dan ranks while in Brazil.

Kimura also trained in karate, believing that karate would strengthen his hands. First, he trained what today is known as Shotokan Karate under its founder Gichin Funakoshi for two years, then switched to training Goju-Ryu Karate under So-Nei Chu (a pupil of Goju-Ryu founder Chojun Miyagi) and finally became an assistant instructor, along with Gogen Yamaguchi and Masutatsu Oyama in his dōjō (the latter also going to university together with him and aikido master Gozo Shioda). In his autobiography, Kimura attributes the use of the makiwara (a karate training implement) as taught to him by So Neichu and his friend and training partner Masutatsu Oyama, as being a significant contributor to his consequent tournament success. He began using the makiwara daily prior to his first All Japan success and never lost another competition bout.

==Kimura vs. Hélio Gracie==
In 1949, after touring for Hawaii, Kimura and his troupe formed by judoka Toshio Yamaguchi and Yukio Kato went to Brazil after an invitation by the &quot;São Paulo Shimbun&quot;. There they were challenged by Hélio Gracie of the Gracie family. Gracie proposed a match under what would be known as the &quot;Gracie Rules&quot;, in which throws and pins would not count towards victory, with only submission or loss of consciousness. This played against judo rules in which pins and throws can award someone a victory, but they accepted nonetheless.

Kato was the first to accept the challenge, drawing with Hélio Gracie in their match at the Maracana stadium. However, he lost to Gracie by gi choke in the rematch at the Ibirapuera Park in São Paulo. Hélio proposed to continue with the challenge, and Yamaguchi appointed himself the next to fight. Kimura, however, volunteered to fight in his place.

The bout between Gracie and Kimura took place again in the Maracanã Stadium, before an audience of 20,000 people, including president of Brazil Getúlio Vargas. The expectation was such that, according to a source, Kimura had been warned by the Japanese embassy that he would not be welcomed back in Japan if he lost the match. Kimura was received in the arena with raw eggs and insults by the Brazilian crowds, and the Gracie challengers brought a coffin to symbolize Kimura would be dead, just like they had done with Kato.

At the start of the match, Hélio tried to throw him down with osoto gari and ouchi gari, but Kimura blocked them and scored multiple throws by ouchi gari, harai goshi, uchi mata and ippon seoi nage. However, Helio Gracie was able to perform ukemi thanks to the soft mat used in competitions, so Kimura could not subdue him by throwing alone. The judoka started planning a way to win between throw and throw, and at the second round he took the fight to the ground, pinning Gracie with kuzure-kami-shiho-gatame.

After a number of holds by the Japanese, including kesa-gatame, sankaku-jime and do-jime, the Brazilian looked unable to breathe under Kimura, but he persevered until he tried to switch position by pushing with his arm. At that moment, Kimura seized the limb and executed gyaku-ude-garami. Hélio did not surrender, and Kimura rotated the arm until it broke. As Gracie still refused to give up, Masahiko twisted the arm further and broke it again.

Finally, when the judoka was about to twist it a third time, Gracie&#x27;s corner threw the towel, and Kimura was declared winner. A crowd of Japanese came and tossed Kimura high in celebration, while doctors treated Hélio&#x27;s arm. As a tribute to Kimura&#x27;s victory, the armlock technique he used to defeat Gracie has since been commonly referred to as the &quot;Kimura lock&quot;, or simply the &quot;Kimura&quot;, in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and, more recently, mixed martial arts circles.

==Professional wrestling career==
In the early 1950s, Kimura founded Kokusai Pro Wrestling Association. He was also invited by Rikidōzan to compete as a professional wrestler in his Japan Pro Wrestling Association. They performed both as tag team partners and as opponents, but Kimura was not marketed or publicized as much as Rikidōzan. In 1954, their series of matches with the Canadian Sharpe Brothers, who were portraying foreign villains, were the first high-profile pro wrestling matches in Japan and led to a pro wrestling boom.

The Rikidōzan vs. Kimura match on 22 December 1954 for the Japanese Heavyweight Championship was a high-profile match, but, according to Kimura, it didn&#x27;t go as planned, being one of the earliest examples of a shoot in modern professional wrestling. The match was supposed to go to a draw and set up a series of rematches, but they never happened. During its course, in a spot in which Kimura would let Rikidōzan strike him with a karate chop in the chest, Rikidōzan broke the script and attacked Kimura for real, striking him in the neck instead and using full force. According to the judoka, the chop hit his neck arteries and he was rendered unconscious, while his opponent started to kick him on the ground. Rikidōzan won the match by knockout, and Kimura never received a rematch.

On December 8, 1963, while partying in a Tokyo nightclub, Rikidōzan was stabbed with a urine-soaked blade by gangster Katsushi Murata who belonged to the ninkyō dantai Sumiyoshi-ikka. He died a week later of peritonitis on December 15. Kimura&#x27;s participation in the incident was suspected, as he is quoted in his autobiography as saying: &quot;I could not forgive his treachery. That night, I received a phone call informing me that several ten yakuza are on their way to Tokyo to kill Rikidozan.&quot; However, Japanese author Toshiya Masuda would release in 2011 the book &quot;Why Kimura Didn&#x27;t Kill Rikidozan&quot;, in which this theory is dismissed.

Kimura formed the International Pro Wrestling Force (IPWF), a promotion based in his hometown of Kumamoto, as a local affiliate of The Japan Wrestling Association (JWA). Although JWA later took over operations, IPWF is remembered for being the first Japanese promotion to introduce Mexican Lucha Libre wrestlers.

Some biographers note that his professional wrestling career began shortly after his wife was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and it is speculated by some that he began professional wrestling to pay for her medication. Indeed, the predicament was likely beyond the financial means of a police instructor, which was his paying job prior to professional wrestling.

In the Korean film about Rikidozan released in 2004, Kimura is portrayed by Masakatsu Funaki but his surname is written &quot;Imura&quot; rather than Kimura.

==Kimura vs. Waldemar Santana==
Kimura went to Brazil again in 1959 to conduct his last professional wrestling tour, and he was challenged by Waldemar Santana to a &quot;real&quot; (not choreographed) submission match. Santana, a champion in jiu-jitsu and capoeira managed by Carlson Gracie, was 27 years old, 6 feet tall, and weighed 205 lb, 40 lbs more than Masahiko, and had knocked out Hélio Gracie in a fight lasting more than three hours. Carlson and Santana declared they were not afraid of Kimura, which Kimura answered by letting the press witness his trainings at Academia Cinelândia, where he allowed partners to try to choke him and smiled while they failed. The Gracie side proposed a grappling match followed by a rematch under vale tudo rules ten days later, with Kimura accepting both. A match against Carlson was also suggested, but the latter declined due to a hand injury.

The first match was placed on July 1 at Maracanãzinho stadium, and it was fought in judogis and four ten-minute rounds. Expectation was low, as Santana was expected not to be a match for Kimura. Indeed, Santana fought through the match with what newspapers described as a defensive strategy, at one point trying to throw himself and Kimura out of the ring, although he scored one solid takedown at one point. Nonetheless, the judoka threw Santana with seoi nage, hane goshi and osoto gari, and finally applied his famous gyaku-ude-garami. Newspaper &quot;Correio da Manha&quot; described the match as a &quot;cat and mouse affair&quot;, while &quot;Diario de Noite&quot; stated &quot;Kimura won at will&quot;.

The second, on the other hand, attracted much more interest, as Santana was a veteran of vale tudo competition while Kimura was not. Hosted on July 12 at Antônio Balbino arena, it would pit Santana against a Kimura on low physical conditions due to illness, as registered in &quot;Diario de Noite&quot; and Kimura&#x27;s own autobiography. According to the latter, promoters supposedly threatened the judoka with police presence in order to compel him to fight against his doctor&#x27;s orders. The two fighters started trading punches and kicks, but the capoeirista soon showed his superiority on this field, damaging Masahiko with high kicks and open-handed strikes. The judoka headbutted him in the abdomen and took him down, where he punished Santana with elbow strikes and more headbutts. Waldemar escaped, however, and answered with another headbutt from the clinch against the ropes. Kimura tried to execute ippon seoi nage, but he slipped and fell to the ground, where Santana started striking him with punches and headbutts through his guard. Eventually, the judoka caught the Brazilian in the momentum of a headbutt and broke his nose with a punch from the bottom. The competitors, both tired and bleeding, disengaged and returned to standing, where they continued exchanging strikes until the clock marked the end of the match.

==Death==
Kimura died on April 18, 1993, after a long battle with lung cancer. He was 75 years old.

<doc id="743007" wikidata="Q2166429" url="?curid=743007" title="Thermal printing">
<text>Thermal printing (or direct thermal printing) is a digital printing process which produces a printed image by passing paper with a thermochromic coating, commonly known as thermal paper, over a print head consisting of tiny electrically heated elements. The coating turns black in the areas where it is heated, producing an image. 

Most thermal printers are monochrome (black and white) although some two-color designs exist.
Grayscale is usually rasterized because it can only be adjusted by temperature control.

Thermal-transfer printing is a different method, using plain paper with a heat-sensitive ribbon instead of heat-sensitive paper, but using similar print heads.
Thermal transfer printer require the use of wax-based ribbons that adhere to the substrate during the printing process. As a result, users must load both labels and ribbon, essentially using an alternative ink system.
== Design ==

A thermal printer typically contains at least these components:

* Thermal head: Produces heat to create an image on the paper
* Platen: A rubber roller which moves the paper
* Spring: Applies pressure to hold the paper and printhead together

Thermal paper is impregnated with a solid-state mixture of a dye and a suitable matrix, for example, a fluoran leuco dye and an octadecylphosphonic acid. When the matrix is heated above its melting point, the dye reacts with the acid, shifts to its colored form, and the changed form is then conserved in metastable state when the matrix solidifies back quickly enough, a process known as thermochromism.

This process is usually monochrome, but some two-color designs exist, which can print both black and an additional color (often red) by applying heat at two different temperatures.

In order to print, the thermal paper is inserted between the thermal head and the platen and pressed against the head. The printer sends an electric current to the heating elements of the thermal head. The heat generated activates the paper&#x27;s thermochromic layer, causing it to turn a certain color (for example, black).

Thermal print heads can have a resolution of up to 1,200 dots per inch (dpi). The heating elements are usually arranged as a line of small closely spaced dots.

Early formulations of the thermo-sensitive coating used in thermal paper were sensitive to incidental heat, abrasion, friction (which can cause heat, thus darkening the paper), light (which can fade printed images), and water. Later thermal coating formulations are far more stable; in practice, thermally printed text should remain legible for at least 50 days.

== Applications ==

Thermal printers print more quietly and usually faster than impact dot matrix printers. They are also smaller, lighter and consume less power, making them ideal for portable and retail applications. 

=== Commercial use ===
Commercial applications of thermal printers include filling station pumps, information kiosks, point of sale systems, voucher printers in slot machines, print on demand labels for shipping and products, and for recording live rhythm strips on hospital cardiac monitors.

=== Record-keeping in microcomputers ===
Many popular microcomputer systems from the late 1970s and early 1980s had first-party and aftermarket thermal printers available for them, such as the Atari 822 printer for the Atari 8-bit computers, the Apple Silentype for the Apple II, and the Alphacom 32 for the ZX Spectrum and ZX81. They often use unusually-sized supplies (10CM wide rolls for the Alphacom 32 for instance) and were often used for making permanent records of information in the computer (graphics, program listings etc.), rather than for correspondence.

=== Fax machines ===
Through the 1990s, many fax machines used thermal printing technology. Toward the beginning of the 21st century, however, thermal wax transfer, laser, and inkjet printing technology largely supplanted thermal printing technology in fax machines, allowing printing on plain paper.

=== Seafloor Exploration ===
Thermal printers are commonly used in seafloor exploration and engineering geology due to their portability, speed, and ability to create continuous reels or sheets. Typically, thermal printers found in offshore applications are used to print realtime records of side scan sonar and sub-seafloor seismic imagery. In data processing, thermal printers are sometimes used to quickly create hard copies of continuous seismic or hydrographic records stored in digital SEG Y or XTF form.

=== Other uses ===
Flight progress strips used in air traffic control (ACARS) typically use thermal printing technology.

In many hospitals in the United Kingdom, many common ultrasound sonogram devices output the results of the scan onto thermal paper. This can cause problems if the parents wish to preserve the image by laminating it, as the heat of most laminators will darken the entire page—this can be tested beforehand on an unimportant thermal print. An option is to make and laminate a permanent ink duplicate of the image.

The Game Boy Printer, released in 1998, was a small thermal printer used to print out certain elements from some Game Boy games.

== Health concerns ==

Reports began surfacing of studies in the 2000s finding the oestrogen-related chemical bisphenol A (&quot;BPA&quot;) mixed in with thermal (and some other) papers. While , various health and science oriented political pressure organizations, such as the Environmental Working Group, have pressed for these versions to be pulled from market.

== History ==
Thermal printing was first used in the 1930s in electrocardiograph recorders. In 1950, this technology was used by 3M in the Thermofax copy machine. However, the first versions of this process were based on the destruction by temperature of a white dye layer, under which was placed a paper pre-colored in black or other contrasting color. This process was unreliable and was later replaced by a better process based on leucopigments, first introduced by NCR for military communications in the 1960s. 

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Compared to other printing solutions, thermal printer printing is very cost-effective. No ink or consumables required. The main advantages are:
*High print speed
*Durability over time
*They are maintenance free
*High quality printing

Main disadvantages:
*Somewhat high cost of dyeing tape and thermal labels
*Short print life (due to high sensitivity to light)

<text>Hydrotherapy, formerly called hydropathy and also called water cure, is a branch of alternative medicine (particularly naturopathy), occupational therapy, and physiotherapy, that involves the use of water for pain relief and treatment. The term encompasses a broad range of approaches and therapeutic methods that take advantage of the physical properties of water, such as temperature and pressure, to stimulate blood circulation, and treat the symptoms of certain diseases.

Various therapies used in the present-day hydrotherapy employ water jets, underwater massage and mineral baths (e.g. balneotherapy, Iodine-Grine therapy, Kneipp treatments, Scotch hose, Swiss shower, thalassotherapy) or whirlpool bath, hot Roman bath, hot tub, Jacuzzi, and cold plunge.
==Uses==

Water therapy may be restricted to use as aquatic therapy, a form of physical therapy, and as a cleansing agent. However, it is also used as a medium for delivery of heat and cold to the body, which has long been the basis for its application. Hydrotherapy involves a range of methods and techniques, many of which use water as a medium to facilitate thermoregulatory reactions for therapeutic benefit.

Shower-based hydrotherapy techniques have been increasingly used in preference to full-immersion methods, partly for the ease of cleaning the equipment and reducing infections due to contamination. When removal of tissue is necessary for the treatment of wounds, hydrotherapy which performs selective mechanical debridement can be used. Examples of this include directed wound irrigation and therapeutic irrigation with suction.

==Technique==
The following methods are used for their hydrotherapeutic effects:

* Packings, general and local;
* Hot air and steam baths;
* General baths;
* Treadmills
* Sitz (sitting), spinal, head, and foot baths;
* Bandages or compresses, wet and dry; also;
* Fomentations and poultices, , , rubbings, and water potations.

Hydrotherapy which involves submerging all or part of the body in water can involve several types of equipment:
* Full body immersion tanks (a &quot;Hubbard tank&quot; is a large size)
* Arm, hip, and leg whirlpool

Whirling water movement, provided by mechanical pumps, has been used in water tanks since at least the 1940s. Similar technologies have been marketed for recreational use under the terms &quot;hot tub&quot; or &quot;spa&quot;.

In some cases, baths with whirlpool water flow are not used to manage wounds, as a whirlpool will not selectively target the tissue to be removed, and can damage all tissue. Whirlpools also create an unwanted risk of bacterial infection, can damage fragile body tissue, and in the case of treating arms and legs, bring risk of complications from edema.

==History==
The therapeutic use of water has been recorded in ancient Egyptian, Greek and Roman civilizations. Egyptian royalty bathed with essential oils and flowers, while Romans had communal public baths for their citizens. Hippocrates prescribed bathing in spring water for sickness. Other cultures noted for a long history of hydrotherapy include China and Japan, the latter being centred primarily around Japanese hot springs. Many such histories predate the Roman thermae.

===Modern revival===

Hydrotherapy became more prominent following the growth and development of modern medical practices in the 18th and 19th century. As traditional medical practice became increasingly professional in terms of how doctors operated, it was felt that medical treatment became increasingly less personalized, the development of hydrotherapy was believed to be a more personal form of medical treatment that did not necessarily present to patients the alienating scientific language that modern developments of medical treatment entailed.

====1700–1810====
Two English works on the medical uses of water were published in the 18th century that inaugurated the new fashion for hydrotherapy. One of these was by Sir John Floyer, a physician of Lichfield, who, struck by the remedial use of certain springs by the neighbouring peasantry, investigated the history of cold bathing and published a book on the subject in 1702. The book ran through six editions within a few years and the translation of this book into German was largely drawn upon by J. S. Hahn of Silesia as the basis for his book called &quot;On the Healing Virtues of Cold Water, Inwardly and Outwardly Applied, as Proved by Experience&quot;, published in 1738.

The other work was a 1797 publication by James Currie of Liverpool on the use of hot and cold water in the treatment of fever and other illness, with a fourth edition published in 1805, not long before his death. It was also translated into German by Michaelis (1801) and Hegewisch (1807). It was highly popular and first placed the subject on a scientific basis. Hahn&#x27;s writings had meanwhile created much enthusiasm among his countrymen, societies having been formed everywhere to promote the medicinal and dietetic use of water; and in 1804 Professor E.F.C. Oertel of Anspach republished them and quickened the popular movement by unqualified commendation of water drinking as a remedy for all diseases.

The general idea behind hydropathy during the 1800s was to be able to induce something called a crisis. The thinking was that water invaded any cracks, wounds, or imperfections in the skin, which were filled with impure fluids. Health was considered to be the natural state of the body, and filling these spaces with pure water, would flush the impurities out, which would rise to the surface of the skin, producing pus. The event of this pus emerging was called a crisis, and was achieved through a multitude of methods. These methods included techniques such as sweating, the plunging bath, the half bath, the head bath, the sitting bath, and the douche bath. All of these were ways to gently expose the patient to cold water in different ways.

==== Vincenz Priessnitz (1799–1851) ====
Vincenz Priessnitz was the son of a peasant farmer who, as a young child, observed a wounded deer bathing a wound in a pond near his home. Over the course of several days, he would see this deer return and eventually the wound was healed. Later as a teenager, Priessnitz was attending to a horse cart, when the cart ran him over, breaking three of his ribs. A physician told him that they would never heal. Priessnitz decided to try his own hand at healing himself, and wrapped his wounds with damp bandages. By daily changing his bandages and drinking large quantities of water, after about a year, his broken ribs had been cured. Priessnitz quickly gained fame in his hometown and became the consulted physician.

Later in life, Priessnitz became the head of a hydropathy clinic in Gräfenberg in 1826. He was extremely successful and by 1840, he had 1600 patients in his clinic including many fellow physicians, as well as important political figures such as nobles and prominent military officials. Treatment length at Priessnitz&#x27;s clinic varied. Much of his theory was about inducing the above-mentioned crisis, which could happen quickly, or could occur after three to four years. In accordance with the simplistic nature of hydropathy, a large part of the treatment was based on living a simple lifestyle. These lifestyle adjustments included dietary changes such as eating only very coarse food, such as jerky and bread, and of course drinking large quantities of water. Priessnitz&#x27;s treatments also included a great deal of less strenuous exercise, mostly including walking. Ultimately, Priessnitz&#x27;s clinic was extremely successful, and he gained fame across the western world. His practice even influenced the hydropathy that took root overseas in America.

==== Sebastian Kneipp (1821–1897) ====
Sebastian Kneipp was born in Germany and he considered his own role in hydropathy to be that of continuing Priessnitz&#x27;s work. Kneipp&#x27;s own practice of hydropathy was even gentler than the norm. He believed that typical hydropathic practices deployed were &quot;too violent or too frequent&quot; and he expressed concern that such techniques would cause emotional or physical trauma to the patient. Kneipp&#x27;s practice was more all encompassing than Priessnitz&#x27;s, and his practice involved not only curing the patients&#x27; physical woes, but emotional and mental as well.

Kneipp introduced four additional principles to the therapy: medicinal herbs, massages, balanced nutrition, and &quot;regulative therapy to seek inner balance&quot;. Kneipp had a very simple view of an already simple practice. For him, hydropathy&#x27;s primary goals were strengthening the constitution and removing poisons and toxins in the body. These basic interpretations of how hydropathy worked hinted at his complete lack of medical training. Kneipp did have, however, a very successful medical practice in spite of, perhaps even because of, his lack of medical training. As mentioned above, some patients were beginning to feel uncomfortable with traditional doctors because of the elitism of the medical profession. The new terms and techniques that doctors were using were difficult for the average person to understand. Having no formal training, all of his instructions and published works are described in easy to understand language and would have seemed very appealing to a patient who was displeased with the direction traditional medicine was taking.

A significant factor in the popular revival of hydrotherapy was that it could be practised relatively cheaply at home. The growth of hydrotherapy (or &#x27;hydropathy&#x27; to use the name of the time), was thus partly derived from two interacting spheres: &quot;the hydro and the home&quot;.

Hydrotherapy as a formal medical tool dates from about 1829 when Vincenz Priessnitz (1799–1851), a farmer of Gräfenberg in Silesia, then part of the Austrian Empire, began his public career in the paternal homestead, extended so as to accommodate the increasing numbers attracted by the fame of his cures.

At Gräfenberg, to which the fame of Priessnitz drew people of every rank and many countries, medical men were conspicuous by their numbers, some being attracted by curiosity, others by the desire of knowledge, but the majority by the hope of cure for ailments which had as yet proved incurable. Many records of experiences at Gräfenberg were published, all more or less favorable to the claims of Priessnitz, and some enthusiastic in their estimate of his genius and penetration.

===Spread of hydrotherapy===

Captain R. T. Claridge was responsible for introducing and promoting hydropathy in Britain, first in London in 1842, then with lecture tours in Ireland and Scotland in 1843. His 10-week tour in Ireland included Limerick, Cork, Wexford, Dublin and Belfast, over June, July and August 1843, with two subsequent lectures in Glasgow.

Some other Englishmen preceded Claridge to Graefenberg, although not many. One of these was James Wilson, who himself, along with James Manby Gully, established and operated a water cure establishment at Malvern in 1842. In 1843, Wilson and Gully published a comparison of the efficacy of the water-cure with drug treatments, including accounts of some cases treated at Malvern, combined with a prospectus of their Water Cure Establishment. Then in 1846 Gully published &quot;The Water Cure in Chronic Disease&quot;, further describing the treatments available at the clinic.

The fame of the water-cure establishment grew, and Gully and Wilson became well-known national figures. Two more clinics were opened at Malvern. Famous patients included Charles Darwin, Charles Dickens, Thomas Carlyle, Florence Nightingale, Lord Tennyson and Samuel Wilberforce. With his fame he also attracted criticism:
Sir Charles Hastings, a physician and founder of the British Medical Association, was a forthright critic of hydropathy, and Gully in particular.
From the 1840s, hydropathics were established across Britain. Initially, many of these were small institutions, catering to at most dozens of patients. By the later nineteenth century the typical hydropathic establishment had evolved into a more substantial undertaking, with thousands of patients treated annually for weeks at a time in a large purpose-built building with lavish facilities – baths, recreation rooms and the like – under the supervision of fully trained and qualified medical practitioners and staff.
In Germany, France and America, and in Malvern, England, hydropathic establishments multiplied with great rapidity. Antagonism ran high between the old practice and the new. Unsparing condemnation was heaped by each on the other; and a legal prosecution, leading to a royal commission of inquiry, served but to make Priessnitz and his system stand higher in public estimation.

Increasing popularity soon diminished caution whether the new method would help minor ailments and be of benefit to the more seriously injured. Hydropathists occupied themselves mainly with studying chronic invalids well able to bear a rigorous regimen and the severities of unrestricted crisis. The need of a radical adaptation to the former class was first adequately recognized by John Smedley, a manufacturer of Derbyshire, who, impressed in his own person with the severities as well as the benefits of the cold water cure, practised among his workpeople a milder form of hydropathy, and began about 1852 a new era in its history, founding at Matlock a counterpart of the establishment at Gräfenberg.

Ernst Brand (1827–1897) of Berlin, Raljen and Theodor von Jürgensen of Kiel, and Karl Liebermeister of Basel, between 1860 and 1870, employed the cooling bath in abdominal typhus with striking results, and led to its introduction to England by Wilson Fox. In the Franco-German War the cooling bath was largely employed, in conjunction frequently with quinine; and it was used in the treatment of hyperpyrexia.

===Hot-air baths===
Hydrotherapy, especially as promoted during the height of its Victorian revival, has often been associated with the use of cold water, as evidenced by many titles from that era. However, not all therapists limited their practice of hydrotherapy to cold water, even during the height of this popular revival.

The specific use of heat was however often associated with Victorian Turkish baths. These were introduced by David Urquhart into England on his return from the East in the 1850s, and ardently adopted by Richard Barter. The Turkish bath became a public institution, and, with the morning tub and the general practice of water drinking, is the most noteworthy of the many contributions by hydropathy to public health.

===Spread to the United States===

The first U.S. hydropathic facilities were established by Joel Shew and Russell Thacher Trall in the 1840s. Charles Munde also established early hydrotherapy facilities in the 1850s. Trall also co-edited the &quot;Water Cure Journal&quot;.

By 1850, it was said that &quot;there are probably more than one hundred&quot; facilities, along with numerous books and periodicals, including the New York &quot;Water Cure Journal&quot;, which had &quot;attained an extent of circulation equalled by few monthlies in the world&quot;. By 1855, there were attempts by some to weigh the evidence of treatments in vogue at that time.

Following the introduction of hydrotherapy to the U.S., John Harvey Kellogg employed it at Battle Creek Sanitarium, which opened in 1866, where he strove to improve the scientific foundation for hydrotherapy. Other notable hydropathic centers of the era included the Cleveland Water Cure Establishment, founded in 1848, which operated successfully for two decades, before being sold to an organization which transformed it into an orphanage.

At its height, there were over 200 water-cure establishments in the United States, most located in the northeast. Few of these lasted into the postbellum years, although some survived into the 20th century including institutions in Scott (Cortland County), Elmira, Clifton Springs and Dansville. While none were located in Jefferson County, the Oswego Water Cure operated in the city of Oswego.
===Subsequent developments===
In November 1881, the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; noted that hydropathy was a specific instance, or &quot;particular case&quot;, of general principles of thermodynamics. That is, &quot;the application of heat and cold in general&quot;, as it applies to physiology, mediated by hydropathy. In 1883, another writer stated &quot;Not, be it observed, that hydropathy is a water treatment after all, but that water is the medium for the application of heat and cold to the body&quot;.

Hydrotherapy was used to treat people with mental illness in the 19th and 20th centuries and before World War II, various forms of hydrotherapy were used to treat alcoholism. The basic text of the Alcoholics Anonymous fellowship, &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;, reports that A.A. co-founder Bill Wilson was treated by hydrotherapy for his alcoholism in the early 1930s.

===Recent techniques===

A subset of cryotherapy involves cold water immersion or ice baths, used by physical therapists, sports medicine facilities and rehab clinics. Proponents assert that it results in improved return of blood flow and byproducts of cellular breakdown to the lymphatic system and more efficient recycling.
Alternating the temperatures, either in a shower or complementary tanks, combines the use of hot and cold in the same session. Proponents claim improvement in circulatory system and lymphatic drainage. Experimental evidence suggests that contrast hydrotherapy helps to reduce injury in the acute stages by stimulating blood flow and reducing swelling.

==Society and culture==
The growth of hydrotherapy, and various forms of hydropathic establishments, resulted in a form of tourism, both in the UK, and in Europe. At least one book listed English, Scottish, Irish and European establishments suitable for each specific malady, while another focused primarily on German spas and hydropathic establishments, but including other areas. While many bathing establishments were open all year round, doctors advised patients not to go before May, &quot;nor to remain after October. English visitors rather prefer cold weather, and they often arrive for the baths in May, and return again in September. Americans come during the whole season, but prefer summer. The most fashionable and crowded time is during July and August&quot;. In Europe, interest in various forms of hydrotherapy and spa tourism continued unabated through the 19th century and into the 20th century, where &quot;in France, Italy and Germany, several million people spend time each year at a spa.&quot; In 1891, when Mark Twain toured Europe and discovered that a bath of spring water at Aix-les-Bains soothed his rheumatism, he described the experience as &quot;so enjoyable that if I hadn&#x27;t had a disease I would have borrowed one just to have a pretext for going on&quot;.

This was not the first time such forms of spa tourism had been popular in Europe and the U.K. Indeed,

in Europe, the application of water in the treatment of fevers and other maladies had, since the seventeenth century, been consistently promoted by a number of medical writers. In the eighteenth century, taking to the waters became a fashionable pastime for the wealthy classes who decamped to resorts around Britain and Europe to cure the ills of over-consumption. In the main, treatment in the heyday of the British spa consisted of sense and sociability: promenading, bathing, and the repetitive quaffing of foul-tasting mineral waters.
A hydropathic establishment is a place where people receive hydropathic treatment. They are commonly built in spa towns, where mineral-rich or hot water occurs naturally.

Several hydropathic institutions wholly transferred their operations away from therapeutic purposes to become tourist hotels in the late 20th century while retaining the name &#x27;Hydro&#x27;. There are several prominent examples in Scotland at Crieff, Peebles and Seamill amongst others.

==Animal hydrotherapy==

Canine hydrotherapy is a form of hydrotherapy directed at the treatment of chronic conditions, post-operative recovery, and pre-operative or general fitness in dogs.

==Notes==

a. While the second sense, of water as a form of torture is documented back to at least the 15th century, the first use of the term &quot;water cure&quot; as a torture is indirectly dated to around 1898, by U.S. soldiers in the Spanish–American War, after the term had been introduced to America in the mid-19th century in the therapeutic sense, which was in widespread use. Indeed, while the torture sense of &quot;water cure&quot; was by 1900–1902 established in the American army, with a conscious sense of irony, this sense was not in widespread use. &quot;Webster&#x27;s&quot; 1913 dictionary cited only the therapeutic sense, &quot;water cure&quot; being synonymous with &quot;hydropathy&quot;, the term by which hydrotherapy was known in the 19th century and early 20th century.

The late 19th century expropriation of the term &quot;water cure&quot;, already in use in the therapeutic sense, to denote the polar opposite of therapy, namely torture, has the hallmark of arising in the sense of irony. This would be in keeping with some of the reactions to water cure therapy and its promotion, which included not only criticism, but also parody and satire.

<text>Bernardo Tanucci (20 February 1698 – 29 April 1783) was an Italian jurist and statesman, who brought an enlightened absolutism style of government to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies for Charles III and his son Ferdinand IV.

==Biography==
Born of a poor family in Stia, near Arezzo (Tuscany), Tanucci was educated, thanks to a patron, at the University of Pisa. Tanucci was appointed a professor of law there in 1725 and attracted attention by his defence of the authenticity of the &quot;Codex Pisanus&quot; of the Pandects of Justinian. When Charles, Duke of Parma, son of Philip V of Spain, who succeeded him as monarch and became Charles III, passed through Tuscany on his way to conquer the Kingdom of Naples, Cosimo III de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, encouraged him to take Tanucci with him. In Naples Charles appointed him at first councillor of state, then superintendent of posts, minister of justice in 1752, foreign minister in 1754 and finally prime minister and a marquis.

As prime minister Tanucci was most zealous regalist in establishing the supremacy of a modernized State over the Catholic Church, and in abolishing the feudal privileges of Papacy and the nobility in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Governing under the principles of enlightened absolutism, he restricted the jurisdiction of the bishops, eliminated medieval privilege, and closed convents and monasteries, and reduced the taxes to be forwarded to the pontifical Curia. These reforms were sanctioned in a Concordat signed with the Papacy in 1741, the application of which, however, went far beyond the intentions of the Holy See.

For the reform of the laws Tanucci instituted a commission of learned jurists with instructions to create a new legal code, the &quot;Codice Caroline&quot;, which was, however, not put into force. When Charles of Naples became Charles III of Spain in 1759, Tanucci was made president of the council of regency instituted for the nine-year-old Ferdinand IV, who even when he reached his majority preferred to leave the government in Tanucci&#x27;s hands, constantly overseen from Spain by Charles III.

In foreign affairs, Tanucci kept Naples out of wars and entanglements, though in 1742 an English fleet off the coast helped ensure Neapolitan neutrality in the war between Spain and Austria. Following the discovery of the Herculaneum papyri in 1752, per the advice from Bernardo, King Charles VII of Naples established a commission to study them.

Tanucci worked at establishing for Bourbon Naples the kind of controls over the church that were effected by the Gallican church in Bourbon France: revenues of vacant bishoprics and abbeys went to the crown, superfluous convents were suppressed, tithes abolished and the acquisition of new Church property by mortmain was forbidden. Royal assent was required for the publication in Naples of papal bulls and concessions were no longer considered eternal. The status of Naples as a papal fief, dating from the time of the Hohenstaufen, was denied: the king of Naples served at the pleasure of God only. Appeals to Rome were forbidden without the royal permission. Marriage was declared a civil contract. And by the order of Charles III the Jesuits were suppressed and expelled from the Kingdom of Naples in 1767, a move in which Tanucci was in general sympathy with other ministers at the Bourbon courts, as Aranda in Spain, Choiseul in France, du Tillot in Parma, and also with Pombal in Portugal.

Pope Clement XIII responded with excommunication, whereupon Tanucci occupied the monasteries at Benevento and Pontecorvo, which were not returned to the Roman Church until after the pope&#x27;s general order of dissolution of the Society of Jesus in 1773. The protests of the bishops against many of the new teachings in the schools after the expulsion of the Jesuits were dismissed as invalid. His policy in finance and in regard to the food taxes provoked popular revolutions on several occasions.

When, in 1774, Maria Carolina of Austria, the Habsburg queen of Ferdinand IV, joined the Council of State, the power of Tanucci began to decline. In vain he endeavored to neutralize the queen&#x27;s influence, but in 1777 he was dismissed and retired.

He died in Naples in 1783.

<text>Christ&#x27;s College, Canterbury is an independent Anglican secondary day and boarding school for boys, located in the city centre of Christchurch, New Zealand.

Founded in 1850 by Reverend Henry Jacobs in Lyttelton as a school for early settlers, the college is the oldest independent school in the country. The college currently caters for approximately 698 students from Year 9 to Year 13.

Christ&#x27;s College is an International Member of The Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference (HMC).

Christ&#x27;s College is one of only three member schools in New Zealand. Christ&#x27;s College is also member of Round Square, an international network of 230 schools in 50 countries around the world. Christ’s College is one of the three Round Square member schools in New Zealand.

==History==
Christ&#x27;s College (formerly Christ&#x27;s College Grammar School) was established in 1850 and directly modelled on the pedagogic vernacular of English public schools, such as Eton College and Radley College. The school was most likely named Christ&#x27;s College by James FitzGerald, Canterbury&#x27;s first Superintendent, after his old College at Cambridge (Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge). At its foundation, the school was run from two rooms at the immigration barracks at Lyttelton, and the emphasis was on a classical education, including Greek and Latin, Modern languages, Mathematics, English, History and Geography. Students were also expected to conduct scientific experiments, to draw and sing. It used to be closely associated with the Lyttelton Collegiate Grammar School which was also located in the Lyttelton Immigration Barracks.

The school left Lyttelton in 1852 and moved over the hill to the St Michael&#x27;s parsonage in Oxford Terrace with 16 students. Henry Jacobs, the first headmaster, ensured that his school enabled both boarders and day boys to attend.

Christ&#x27;s College moved to its present site in 1856, with 35 pupils and a staff of three. This location, adjacent to the Government Domain (now Hagley Park), provided the college with room to expand, and the school gradually began to acquire additional buildings. The first of these building were wooden, providing homes for the staff and their families and an increasing number of boarders. By 1863, Big School, the first of the stone buildings, had been built on the west side of the quadrangle in which all classes were taught (in present-day it is the school&#x27;s library with additions by Sir Miles Warren and currently the oldest educational building still in use in New Zealand), followed in 1867 by the Chapel. The school developed slowly around this central quadrangle, and today the &#x27;quad&#x27; is treated with reverence, and therefore students are not permitted to walk on it, only staff members and permitted visitors. The Cathedral Grammar School used to be the Lower School of Christ&#x27;s College when it struggled financially from 1895 to 1922.

In its early days, the college taught boys as young as six, with each boy arriving with a different level of education. Subsequently, there was a wide age range in many classes and, until the number of classrooms increased, they were all taught together.

The school motto, &quot;Bene Tradita, Bene Servanda&quot; in Latin translates to &quot;good traditions, well maintained&quot;.
===Campus===
In the original survey of central Christchurch (known as the Black Map), which was undertaken in 1850, it was envisaged for Christ&#x27;s College and ChristChurch Cathedral to be built adjacent to one another in Cathedral Square, modelled on Christ Church, Oxford. The area set aside for the college in Cathedral Square, 3 acres 1 rood and 3 perches (), was found to be insufficient. In a meeting in June 1853 between Henry Sewell, Henry Jacobs, Rev. Robert Bateman Paul, and Thomas Cass, Sewell took the group for a visit of a site earmarked as the Government Domain (i.e. botanical gardens). The group agreed on the site, subject to approval by Bishop Selwyn, which was later obtained. Years later, this land transaction was formalised through &quot;The Cathedral Square Ordinance 1858&quot;, a law passed by the Canterbury Provincial Council in October 1858. The compensation paid for the transfer of land to the Provincial Council was £1,200, but with , the college was also given a much larger piece of land.

The Christ&#x27;s College grounds have a collection of nineteenth century, and turn-of-the-century buildings, as well as newly built buildings such as the Old Boys Theatre and the Fine Arts Building. The neogothic style is dominant, as was the case for most notable colonial-period buildings in Christchurch, such as the cathedral, and the original buildings of Canterbury University (formerly Canterbury College), which is now the Christchurch Arts Centre. &#x27;Big School&#x27;, built in 1863, is the original classroom for the Christchurch site of the school, and is one of the oldest surviving buildings of its type in New Zealand.

=== Upper department (College House, University of Canterbury) ===
College House was created as part of Christ&#x27;s College in 1850. According to College House: The upper department became a residential college of the university after it was founded, and soon it was referred to as College House. The upper and lower departments (tertiary and secondary departments) separated in 1957, and College House became independent.

== Enrolment ==
As a private school, Christ&#x27;s College charges tuition fees to cover costs. For the 2025 school year, tuition fees for New Zealand residents are $34,190 per year. Boarding fees are an additional $22,250 per year.

As of , Christ&#x27;s College has roll of students, of which (%) identify as Māori. As a private school, the school is not assigned an Equity Index.

==College life==
===Chapel===

The chapel is an integral part of the school with compulsory religious education being undertaken until Year 11. Every Wednesday congregational practice takes place, in which the whole school sings, and practises hymns, psalms, prayers and chapel routine. Boys are also required to attend chapel on Monday and Friday mornings and usually alternative Sundays, even if it coincides with their own church service outside the school. The school chapel service takes priority and compulsory two services each term are required. Parents and family are welcome to attend Sunday chapel. Music is an integral part of school life, the Christ&#x27;s College Chapel Choir consists of approximately eighty boys though changes yearly with the incoming year 9 group and leaving year 13&#x27;s. The choir sings at chapel services, public and private events and takes part in several singing competitions such as the Big Sing, and in 2007 the international Summa Cum Laude Festival in Vienna (attaining second place).

===Curriculum===

The school offers students NCEA Levels 2 and 3 and scholarship examinations through NZQA. From 2022, they have discontinued NCEA Level 1 and replaced it with &#x27;the College Diploma&#x27;, a two-year course from Year 10–11. There are many academic disciplines offered at the school as subjects, varying from the standard English and Mathematics to French, drama, classical studies, physical education, art history, sciences and many other subjects. Mathematics is compulsory up to and including year 11. Year 9, 10, and 11 classes consist of a wide array of subjects to introduce students to different subject to see what they enjoy before having to select subjects in year 12 which go towards NCEA level 2.

===Extra-curricular===

Christ&#x27;s College also places a strong emphasis on extra-curricular activities. Throughout the year there are opportunities in many areas; speech and drama, kapa haka, music, debating, model United Nations and several other activities. Performing arts are a large aspect of college life, with all boys expected to participate in at least one part; there is a Junior and Senior production each year (in collaboration with Rangi Ruru Girls&#x27; School or St Margaret&#x27;s College), an annual House Singing competition and the REACTION House Play festival, where each house forms a group of students to perform a play for the Tothill Cup Interhouse Drama Trophy. Students are encouraged to partake in areas they have not attempted before, especially within these inter-house arts competitions.

===Sport===
Sport is compulsory for all boys; there is an extensive selection of sports available with boys choosing both a summer and winter option each year. As well as school sports, there are ongoing inter-house sports competitions, where all students are expected to participate in, or to come and support their houses. Extra sporting activities are also available: for example, the school ski club buses to the ski fields on weekends during winter terms. Sports facilities on site include Upper, the school playing field, an all weather facility, a 5-lane indoor 25-metre heated swimming pool, gymnasium and weights room. Offsite facilities include the nearby Christ&#x27;s College cricket ground (which also has football and rugby fields) which consists of four hectares of South Hagley Park, and Kerr&#x27;s Reach on the Avon River which is home to the Christ&#x27;s College rowing club, consisting of a boat house which houses top quality rowing equipment.
It is claimed that a form of rugby was being played at the school as early as 1853. Each year its rugby team plays with Wanganui Collegiate School, Wellington College and Nelson College in a tournament known as the &quot;Quadrangular&quot;. It also has a long-running rivalry with Christchurch Boys&#x27; High School, and an annual rugby match between the two schools is fiercely contested. 
==House system==
In keeping with the tradition of English public schools, Christ&#x27;s College has ten Houses accommodating around 700 students. There are three boarding houses and the dayboys are organised into seven more houses. Each house has a housemaster responsible for the care of the boys.

From the school&#x27;s early days, Houses were a base for boarders within the school, and these changed their names as Masters came and went. The name Jacobs has been retained, while others have been replaced by School, Richards and Flower&#x27;s. It was not until 1909 that the first two day-boy Houses were established. They were named &#x27;North Town&#x27; and &#x27;South Town&#x27;, and students were allocated to them depending on whether their homes were north or south of Gloucester Street. In 1924, these Houses were named Harper and Julius – Condell&#x27;s, Corfe, Rolleston and Somes have also been added over the years.

The year groups within the Houses are encouraged to build House spirit and to compete in sporting and cultural competitions. Cricket and football games were established as soon as there were enough boarders to compete against each other, and gradually music and drama competitions have been added.

===Day Houses===
*Condell&#x27;s
*Corfe
*Harper
*Julius
*Rolleston
*Somes
*Jacobs (Transitioned to a day house end of 2016)

Houses for dayboys provide a place for study and recreation, a Common Room, showers and changing facilities, and areas for storing books and sports clothing. Boys meet here at the beginning of each day for House Assembly where they receive notices for the day and reminders of forthcoming events to prepare for from their Housemaster.

===Boarding Houses===

*Flower&#x27;s
*Richards
*School

In the boarding environment, the facilities and support systems are more comprehensive. Assisting the Housemaster are an assistant housemaster, a matron, and two live-in tutors who are also studying at university. Most of the school facilities, such as the library, computer room, gymnasium, pool, music and art rooms, and the workshop, are open for use by boarding boys out of school hours. Evening activities during the week include set times for homework, but recreational activities are also encouraged.

The Christ&#x27;s College Boarding Programme keeps boarders busy in the weekends. With age-appropriate activities tailored to each year group&#x27;s needs, boarders are given a number of opportunities that may not be available to dayboys.

==Uniform==

The black and white striped blazers and ties Christ&#x27;s College boys wear are recognisable and well known especially within Christchurch. There are two types of uniform: Sport&#x27;s Uniform, Dress Uniform (known by the boys as stripes or suits). During Winter terms dress uniform is worn on Mondays and Fridays, and sports uniform is worn on Tuesday, Wednesdays and Thursdays. Dress uniform is required for chapel services and other formal occasions. A high standard of dress is expected at all times and boys are punished for incorrect or incorrectly worn uniform, boys must always wear their blazers when in town, even with summer uniform.

Each house has a different uniform for inter house sporting events and is made up of a rugby jersey or singlet in the house colour and black or white shorts, depending on the house. Each different sport also has its own uniform for games, a black tracksuit with College crest is required for travelling to and from games venues and for field trips where the uniform of the day is not suitable.

==Governance==
The Christ&#x27;s College governing body comprises a chairman, Warden and Fellows. The Bishop of Christchurch is &quot;ex officio&quot; Warden.

=== Current ===
* Warden: Bishop of Canterbury, Peter Carrell
* Executive principal: Joe Eccleton

<text>Achaemenes ( ; ; ) was the progenitor (apical ancestor) of the Achaemenid dynasty of rulers of Persia.

Other than his role as an apical ancestor, nothing is known of his life or actions. It is quite possible that Achaemenes was only the mythical ancestor of the Persian royal house, but if Achaemenes was a historical person, he would have lived around the end of the 8th century and the beginning of the 7th century BC.

== Name ==
The name used in European languages ( (&#x27;), ) ultimately derives from Old Persian &#x27; (), as found together with Elamite (&quot;Ha-ak-ka-man-nu-iš&quot; or &quot;Hâkamannuiš&quot;) and Akkadian (&quot;A-ḫa-ma-ni-iš-ʾ&quot;) in the non-contemporaneous trilingual Behistun Inscription of Darius I. The Old Persian proper name is traditionally derived from &#x27; &quot;friend&quot; and &#x27; &quot;thinking power&quot;, yielding &quot;having a friend&#x27;s mind.&quot; A more recent interpretation reads &quot;&quot; as &quot;follower&quot;, giving &quot;characterized by a follower&#x27;s spirit.&quot; The name is spelled (&quot;Haxâmaneš&quot;) in Modern Persian.

== Historicity ==
In the Behistun inscription (&quot;c.&quot; 520 BC), Darius I portrays Achaemenes as the father of Teispes, ancestor of Cyrus II (Cyrus the Great) and Darius I. The mid-5th century BC &quot;Histories&quot; (7.11) of Herodotus has essentially the same story, but fuses two parallel lines of descent from &quot;Teispes son of Achaemenes&quot;. Beyond such brief mentions of the name, nothing is known of the figure behind it, neither from indigenous sources nor from historiographic ones. It may be that Achaemenes was just a mythical ancestor, not a historical one. Many scholars believe he was a ruler of Parsumash, a vassal state of the Median Empire, and that from there he led armies against the Assyrian king Sennacherib at the Battle of Halule in 691 BC.

=== Behistun inscription ===
It may be that the Behistun inscription&#x27;s claim of descent from Achaemenes was an invention of Darius I, in order to justify the latter&#x27;s seizure of the throne. Cyrus II does not mention Achaemenes at all in the detailed genealogy given in the Cyrus cylinder. While the patronym &quot;haxāmanišiya&quot;—&quot;of [the clan of] Achaemenes&quot;—does appear in an inscription at Pasargadae attributed to Cyrus II, this inscription may have been written on the order of Darius I after Cyrus&#x27; death. As such, Achaemenes could be a retrograde creation of Darius the Great, made in order to legitimize a dynastic relationship to Cyrus the Great. Darius certainly had much to gain in having an ancestor shared by Cyrus and himself, and may have felt the need for a stronger connection than that provided by his subsequent marriage to Cyrus&#x27; daughter Atossa.

=== Greek writers ===
The Greek writers of antiquity preserve several legends surrounding the figure: The Pseudo-Platonic dialogue &quot;First Alcibiades&quot; (120e), written in the late 4th-century BC, portrays Achaemenes as the hero-founder of the Persái in the same way that the Greeks are descended from Heracles, and that both Achaemenes and Hercules were descendants of Perseus, son of Zeus. Another version of the tale makes Achaemenes the son of Aegeus, yet another founder-hero of legend. The 3rd-century Aelianus (&quot;De nat. anim.&quot; 12.21) says Achaemenes was bred by an eagle.

<text>Singkawang (Dayak Salako: &quot;Sakawokng&quot;), or San-Khew-Jong (; Pha̍k-fa-sṳ: ), is a coastal city and port located in the province of West Kalimantan, on the island of Borneo in Indonesia. It is located at about 145 km north of Pontianak, the provincial capital, and is surrounded by the Pasi, Poteng, and Sakkok mountains. Singkawang is derived from the Salako language, which refers to a very wide area of swamps (all swamps). In addition, the ancestors of the Hakka Chinese community in Sakawokng also named this area in Hakka as &quot;San-Khew-Jong&quot; (Mount-Mouth-Sea), which means &quot;A city located at the foot of a mountain near the sea and has a river that flows up to the mouth of the river (estuary).&quot;

The city was created on 21 June 2001 by separation from Bengkayang Regency. It is bordered to the east and south by Bengkayang Regency, to the west by the South China Sea, and to the north by Sambas Regency. It covers an area of 504 km2 and had a population of 186,462 at the 2010 Census and 235,064 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 246,112 (comprising 125,788 males and 120,324 females).

==History==
Singkawang ( in chinese : 山口洋 ) name came from one of chinese language ( Hakka language)The word &quot;San&quot; (山) which means Mountain and Forest, the word &quot;Khew&quot; (口) which means the mouth of the river, and the word &quot;Jong&quot; (洋) which means the sea. The miners and traders who came mostly from China, before they headed towards Monterado, first rested in Singkawang, while gold miners from Monterado often rested in Singkawang to remove their tiredness, while Singkawang also served as the transit point for the transportation of gold dust. At that time, they called Singkawang with the word Sakawokng (Salakko Dayak language), which means a very wide swampy swamp area located on the beach. Dayak Salako are part of the soldiers and intelligence of the Sultanate of Sambas which was given territorial territory in Binua Sarauntung Sakawokng.

Basically the Salako Dayak tribe has long inhabited the Sakawokng area before it became a bustling trading area. The Hakka Chinese who came from South China, who were mostly farmers, traders, and gold miners at that time entered the Sakawokng area through small rivers in the Sado (Sedau) area. At first, the Singkawang area was still a vast wilderness filled with swamps. Due to its geographical location, the Hakka Chinese immigrants named this area in Hakka as &quot;San Khew Jong&quot; (山口洋).

These three syllables really describe the geographical location of Singkawang which is surrounded by mountains and adjacent to the sea and has a river that flows from upstream to downstream and empties into the mouth of the river (estuary). Coincidentally or not, the name San Khew Jong given by the Hakka Chinese immigrants has the same sound and meaning as the name Sakawokng, which was first named by the Salako Dayak ancestors. This shows that there has been a well-established interaction since time immemorial between the Chinese Hakka community and the indigenous Dayak Salako Sakawokng, especially in terms of language and culture.

Singkawang was previously used to be as the administrative centre of Sambas Regency under the status of Singkawang district. On 12 December 1981, Singkawang became administrative city within that regency. On 27 April 1999, when Bengkayang Regency was established, Singkawang became part of that regency, while the administrative centre of Sambas Regency was moved back to Sambas from the city on 15 July. The city was formed as an autonomous city on 21 June 2001 by separation from Bengkayang Regency.

==Administrative districts==
Prior to decentralization in which time during Singkawang as an administrative city within Sambas Regency before it established as an independent city in 2001, the city had three administrative districts, Roban, Pasiran and Tujuhbelas. These three districts were previously part of undivided Singkawang district until 1981. In 2003, the districts later reorganized by splitting the Tujuhbelas district into three new districts (East Singkawang and North Singkawang, while Tujuhbelas district renamed as South Singkawang), while residual districts of Roban and Pasiran were renamed as Central Singkawang and West Singkawang, respectively.

The city is divided into five administrative districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;), listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and the 2020 Census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023. The table also includes the number of urban villages (&quot;kelurahan&quot;) in each district, and its post codes.

Note: (a) including offshore island of &quot;Pulau Simping&quot;.

==Climate==
Singkawang has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with heavy to very heavy rainfall year-round.
==Demographics==

Most of the population are of Chinese descent (around 42% of whole population). The largest group of Chinese descent is Hakka people (locally called as &quot;Hakka-nyin&quot; who speak -the local Hakka dialect). The other major group of Chinese descent is Chaozhou People which is better known as Teochew. The rest are Malay, Dayak, Javanese, and other ethnicities. The total population was 235,064 at the 2020 Census.

The distribution of the religion practically follows the distribution of the ethnic groups; the largest groups are Islam followed by Buddhism, Catholic, Protestant and Confucianism.

==Food ==
Chinese food especially Hakka style dominates the food stalls or small restaurants, but Teochew style is also available. Minang style food can also be found here. Unique food like &quot;Rujak Ju Hie&quot; (鱿鱼炒; rojak with dried squid) is one of delicacies in Singkawang. Tofu (bean curd) Singkawang is famous in West Kalimantan, also &quot;Kembang Tahu&quot; (腐皮; silky smooth tofu with sugar gravy) is very popular in this city. Singkawang is also famous for its cakes. The variety of cakes is surprising and available from early morning till midnight. &quot;Choi Pan&quot; (菜粄:Steamed vegetable dumplings) is one of the many special traditional Chinese delicacies. Believed to be of Hakka origin, it consists mainly of fragrantly stir-fried yam bean wrapped in a slightly chewy translucent skin and is steamed to perfection. There are also have several Malay food such as Bubur Paddas (Malay&#x27;s spicy porridge), &quot;Pedak&quot; (fermented shrimp paste) and Nasi Lemak. &quot;Kopi tiam&quot; (咖啡店; local coffee shop) with strong bitter &quot;robusta&quot; coffee can be found every where.

One may enjoy various food in &quot;Pasar Hongkong&quot; from porridge, kwetiau, fried rice, nasi lemak, rujak (fruit &amp; vegetables salad), cakes coffee stall. And the prices of the food are surprisingly cheap. Local people enjoy the night with their friends discussing the local hottest issues, singing, or playing cards.

==Chinatown==
Besides being well known as the City of Thousands Temples, as there are many small and large temples in any part of the Singkawang region, Singkawang is also known as one of the Indonesian Chinatowns since the majority of the population is of Chinese descent, consisting of mostly Hakka and some other sub-group of Han Chinese. Theye reside in all areas in the city. They still practice their culture in any ceremony or official events, from weddings to funeral ceremonies. The culture is seen as the closest to the original tradition of Chinese people (mostly refers to Hakka), making Singkawang known as the Indonesian Chinatown.

==Languages==
Because over 70% of the population of this city is of Chinese Indonesian descent, most people in this city speak Chinese (Hakka). Singkawang people use Indonesian as the primary language in conversation or trading and also use their own mother tongue. As Singkawang consists of three major ethnic groups, Chinese, Malays and Dayaks, the majority of Singkawang people use either Indonesian or Hakka Chinese for conversation. The Indonesian used in Singkawang commonly for daily conversation is not standard Indonesian, but has some Malay influence on vocabulary as Malay is the closest language to Indonesian and the Singkawang people have for years been accustomed to Malay.

==Transportation==
As of today, there is no airport at Singkawang, and is instead served by Supadio International Airport. It is connected by road and can be reached by bus or taxi from Pontianak covering a distance of 150 km. It is also connected by road to Kuching in Malaysia via the Aruk/Biawak border and Sambas. A toll road to Pontianak is under consideration.

==Mail order bride scandal==
There have been allegations of human trafficking in Singkawang, based upon the town&#x27;s mail order bride illegal business. Most of the men who travel to Singkawang looking for young women to marry are from Taiwan, Mainland China, or Singapore. These men arrive and get in touch with brokers, these brokers then approach families with suitably aged daughters and generally offers these parents about 6 million rupiahs (about US$450) for each girl.

It is most normal for a majority of these foreign clients to pay an amount exceedingly more than what is requested by the brokers and most payments are at an average of 30 million rupiahs (about US$2,250). Contracts are often drawn between the brokers and the clients. It is a fact that each contract includes a time period clause and most of these marriages are contractually bound for 2 to 4 years, some for even shorter periods of time. It is also common for these relationships to not be legally bound marriages.

Indonesian police actively arrest the offender of mail order bride.

<text>The Ford Torino Talladega is a muscle car that was produced by Ford only during the first few weeks of 1969. It was named for the Talladega Superspeedway, which opened the same year. The Talladega was a special, more aerodynamic version of the Torino / Fairlane produced specifically to make Ford even more competitive in NASCAR racing, and it was sold to the public only because homologation rules required a certain minimum number of cars (500 in 1969) be produced and made available.

A largely equivalent vehicle was also sold under the Mercury marque as the Cyclone Spoiler II.

==Design==
The 1969 Torino Talladega was based on the Fairlane &quot;Sportsroof&quot; (Ford&#x27;s trade name for a fastback) 2-door hardtop. To make the car more aerodynamic at high speeds, a sleeker front section (whose design and construction is often attributed to the Holman-Moody race team&#x27;s shop) was added. Regular production Fairlanes and Torinos had a then-fashionable inset grille and headlights, which fared poorly in the wind tunnel. The Torino Talladega replaced this nose with one that extended the car&#x27;s length by about six inches, with a flush-mounted grille on a more aerodynamic front end. The close-fitting bumper was actually a rear bumper that had been cut, narrowed, V&#x27;ed in the center, and filled on the ends to create a crude air dam, further improving the aerodynamics of the car at high speeds.
In another well kept secret design move, the rocker panels of the Talladega were reshaped and rolled to allow Ford teams to run their racing cars about an inch closer to the ground while staying within NASCAR rules; this also greatly enhanced the top speed of the car by lowering its center of gravity, and further reducing its wind resistance. The cars were also equipped with an engine oil cooler, a power steering oil cooler, staggered shocks, a 3.25:1 Ford 9 inch 31 spline nodular open rear end, and most surprisingly: a heavy duty C-6 (cast iron tailshaft) automatic transmission that was column shifted. These other special performance parts were normally only available when ordering a &quot;drag pack car&quot; which would have been equipped with a 4-speed and a limited-slip rear end.

Also unique to the Talladega was the presence of competition black hoods and rear tail panels on all production cars, as well as the only interior offered: black vinyl and cloth with a front bench seat.

==Racing involvement==

Racing versions of the car were initially fitted with the FE 427 side oiler engine that had been Ford&#x27;s main racing engine since 1963. Later in the season, the Boss 429 engine was used by many of the teams, after it had finally been declared &quot;officially homologated&quot; by NASCAR president Bill France. The Boss 429 engine was homologated in the 1969 Ford Mustang Boss 429. In a very unusual move, Ford homologated the engine separately from the car in which it was to race. Many experts think this may have been done in order to get the bodywork of the Talladega officially homologated at the beginning of the 1969 race season, as the Boss 429 was not yet in production in sufficient numbers to homologate it. All production Talladegas were actually equipped with the new 428 Cobra Jet, which, while very powerful and reliable, was intended as a street engine for Ford&#x27;s muscle cars, as it developed high torque at low RPMs, rather than being a high-revving race engine.

===Accolades===
The Torino Talladega did exactly what Ford hoped it would do on the racing circuit: it won 29 Grand National races during the 1969 and 1970 NASCAR seasons - far more than any other model. Further, it won the 1969 NASCAR Manufacturer&#x27;s Championship with David Pearson winning the Driver&#x27;s Championship, and it won the 1969 ARCA Manufacturer&#x27;s Championship with Benny Parsons winning that Driver&#x27;s Championship. Chrysler&#x27;s initial competitor was the Dodge Charger 500, which proved to be aerodynamically inferior to the Talladega, especially on NASCAR&#x27;s super speedways (tracks of a mile or more in length).

After realizing that Ford&#x27;s Talladega (and its sister ship, the Mercury Spoiler II) were much more effective as race cars, Dodge went back to the drawing board to create the Dodge Charger Daytona, which managed to win a total of 6 races during the 1969 and 1970 NASCAR seasons. Richard Petty finished second in NASCAR&#x27;s Grand National points race in 1969, driving a Talladega.

===Abandonment===
1969 was Ford&#x27;s last year of factory involvement in racing of any kind for several years. Following Congressional hearings in which they were questioned about the R&amp;D costs of racing vs. improving fuel economy and safety, Ford completely abandoned all of their racing programs, starting with the 1970 season. Subsequently, most of the NASCAR and ARCA race teams that were running Fords continued to run their 1969 Talladegas in 1970 without any factory support, when it became apparent that their Talladegas were aerodynamically superior to the 1970 Torinos Ford had intended to be the Talladega&#x27;s replacement. After the 1970 season, NASCAR effectively banned the &quot;aero cars&quot; by restricting all five of these &quot;production&quot; cars to having to compete with engines no larger than 305 cubic inches of displacement (vs. the 426, 427, &amp; 429 cubic inches other cars could use), and the competitive history of the Talladega (and its aerodynamically developed rivals) was essentially over.

==Production numbers==

It is believed a total of 754 Talladegas may have been built, although the Talladega/Spoiler Registry can only account for 750. This number includes all prototypes, pilot cars, and production cars built, plus a special post-production car for the president of Ford Motor Company, Semon &quot;Bunkie&quot; Knudsen, in March 1969. The Knudsen car was significantly different from all of the homologation cars with regard to options and color, and was even built at a different plant: Ford&#x27;s Lorain, Ohio plant on March 20, 1969.

All production examples were constructed during January and February 1969 at Ford&#x27;s Atlanta Assembly plant in Atlanta, Georgia, and all homologation cars between January 21 and February 28. (According to the Talladega/Spoiler Registry&#x27;s records, Talladega number 502 was actually completed on January 31, and then the last 247 homologation cars were built between February 14 and February 28, following a 2-week break in production.) It is unknown as to why Ford built an &quot;extra&quot; 247 homologation cars, once the homologation requirements had been met during the initial run, as it is thought that Ford lost several thousand dollars on every Talladega that was built.

The only options offered on the production vehicles (besides the three color choices, including Wimbledon White (286 built), Royal Maroon (258 built) or Presidential Blue (199 built)) were power steering, power brakes, color keyed racing mirrors, AM radio and argent styled steel wheels with F70 X 14 wide oval tires. All production Talladegas received the same options with no substitutions including the C6 automatic transmission and Code 9 3.25 ratio conventional rear axle.

==Collectors==

Today, a Torino Talladega is a very collectible car. It was a special purpose built vehicle (some have even called it a &quot;showroom race car&quot;) with a very strong racing history, with major links to the NASCAR teams of 1969, that achieved great success during the Aero Wars. Those few examples that still exist today, do so in very limited numbers. Until recently, their values had not risen nearly as high as the Mopar &quot;aero cars&quot; in spite of their rarity and their great track successes during the pinnacle of stock car racing (the aero wars years). Some experts have assumed that this was due to the sheer outrageousness of the Dodge Charger Daytona and the Plymouth Superbird, with their bolted on huge rear wings and nose cones; as the MOPAR winged cars&#x27; prices had eclipsed the far more subtle, and aerodynamically integrated, bodywork of the Ford Torino Talladega and its sibling, the Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II. Regardless, most experts still consider the Talladegas and the Spoiler IIs to be very undervalued; but, in 1969 (and overall during the two years of the Aero Wars) Ford&#x27;s Talladegas (and Spoiler IIs) owned the high banks of NASCAR and ARCA.

<text>Slaughter is an American hard rock band that formed in Las Vegas, Nevada in 1988. The group was founded by lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Mark Slaughter and bassist Dana Strum, who previously played together in the band Vinnie Vincent Invasion. The addition of guitarist Tim Kelly and drummer Blas Elias allowed Slaughter to quickly gain attention for their lively performances, catchy hooks, and melodic guitar solos.

Following Tim Kelly&#x27;s death in a car accident in 1998, Slaughter added Jeff Blando as their new guitarist, who has remained an essential part of the band&#x27;s lineup ever since. Blando also contributed to the band&#x27;s most recent studio album.

Slaughter&#x27;s music was heavily influenced by the hard rock and heavy metal scene of the 1980s, with an aggressive yet melodic sound. To date, Slaughter has released five studio albums, two live albums, and one compilation album. Their debut album &quot;Stick It to Ya&quot;, released in 1990, has sold over two million copies worldwide and went double platinum, producing hit singles such as &quot;Up All Night&quot; and &quot;Fly to the Angels&quot;. Their follow-up album, &quot;The Wild Life&quot;, has sold over 500,000 copies, receiving a gold certification.

In addition to their commercial success, Slaughter has also received critical acclaim for their music, including winning the American Music Award for Favorite &quot;Heavy Metal/Hard Rock New Artist&quot; in 1991, beating out other popular hard rock and heavy metal acts of the time.

Despite changes in the music industry in the early 1990s, Slaughter has continued to release new music and tour regularly, becoming a staple of the rock and metal festival circuit since their inception. Over the years, Slaughter has taken part in a number of renowned festivals, including the Monsters of Rock Cruise, the M3 Rock Festival, and Rocklahoma. They have also played numerous headline shows and tours throughout the United States and abroad. The band&#x27;s high-energy live performances and dedication to their fans have helped them maintain a strong and loyal following for over three decades.

==History==
Slaughter formed in Las Vegas, Nevada in late 1988. Previously, lead vocalist Mark Slaughter and bassist Dana Strum had been in Vinnie Vincent Invasion. Vinnie Vincent Invasion&#x27;s record company, Chrysalis Records, took the $4 million contract away from Vinnie Vincent for exceeding his credit line with the label, and transferred the contract to former members Slaughter and Strum. By 1989, Slaughter and Strum completed the lineup by recruiting lead guitarist Tim Kelly and drummer Blas Elias.

Slaughter&#x27;s debut album &quot;Stick It to Ya&quot; had three singles released that hit the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100: the hit &quot;Fly to the Angels&quot; (US#19), and the moderate hits &quot;Up All Night&quot; (US#27) and &quot;Spend My Life&quot; (US#39). During this time, a song was released from the soundtrack to the film &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot;. That song, titled &quot;Shout It Out&quot;, was accompanied by a music video but failed to make the US Hot 100.

In 1992, the band released their second album, titled &quot;The Wild Life&quot;. It reached number eight on the US Billboard Top 200 Album Chart and was certified gold, but did not produce any Top 40 hits on the US Hot 100. The only single to reach the Hot 100 was the first single &quot;Real Love&quot; (US#69).

The band planned to record their third album in early 1994. However, in 1993 guitarist Tim Kelly was arrested for charges of drug trafficking, while bassist Dana Strum had a motorcycle accident that injured his playing hand. The delayed album was completed in February 1994 and the first single &quot;Searchin&#x27;&quot; was released. However, following Chrysalis Records absorption into EMI Records, Slaughter was dropped from EMI.

The band subsequently signed with CMC International, a new label at the time that signed many hard rock and metal bands in the face of the new grunge popularity. The label had major distribution through BMG. In 1995, Slaughter released the album &quot;Fear No Evil&quot;. The album did not have much success in North America, Europe, or much of Asia but performed well in Japan. Guitarist Dave Marshall (ex-Vince Neil band) had to fill in for Kelly at times, due to his legal problems.

Kelly&#x27;s legal troubles ended and the band committed to their next album. In 1997, &quot;Revolution&quot; was released. The album featured a more eclectic and psychedelic sound, but failed to make an impact. On February 5, 1998, tragedy struck when guitarist Tim Kelly was killed in an auto accident in the Arizona desert. This deeply affected the group, but they were committed to continue with the band. Dave Marshall briefly performed as a touring guitarist for Slaughter in Japan. In 1998, they hired Jeff Blando as Kelly&#x27;s replacement and began working on their next album. A live album titled &quot;Eternal Live&quot; was released featuring some of the band&#x27;s last performances with Kelly.

In 1999, they released the album &quot;Back to Reality&quot;, featuring Blando as the new guitarist. Blando was previously in Left For Dead and Saigon Kick. Slaughter continues to play many rock package tours with other acts that saw prominence during the glam era of the 1980s and early 1990s. During the summer of 1999, while on the &quot;Rock Never Stops Tour&quot; (which included Ted Nugent and Night Ranger), Slaughter saw some of their previous singles on compilation albums. The VH-1 album &quot;Power Ballads&quot; included &quot;Fly To The Angels&quot;; &quot;Up All Night&quot; was included on Rhino Records &quot;Hard Hitters&quot;. Slaughter also took part in the Summer 2000 &quot;Poison, Cinderella, Dokken and Slaughter&quot; tour.

In 2001, Slaughter was a part of the &quot;Voices of Metal&quot; tour featuring Vince Neil of Mötley Crüe, Ratt, and Vixen. Mark Slaughter and Dana Strum&#x27;s former Vinnie Vincent Invasion bandmate Bobby Rock played as a touring drummer for Slaughter, filling in for Blas Elias on some shows of the Rock Never Stops Tour. In April 2004, Slaughter released a DVD-A entitled &quot;Then and Now&quot; that features 12 songs and 50 photos of the band over the years. Slaughter also released a DVD that features all of the music videos and behind the scenes footage during the 2004 season.

On July 13, 2007, Slaughter performed at glam metal festival Rocklahoma. However, Strum and Blando were not present during the band&#x27;s performance, though they did perform with Vince Neil the following night. At the end of January 2008 Slaughter performed a show at Motley Cruise, a four-day cruise in the Caribbean with Vince Neil, Skid Row, Ratt, Endeverafter, Lynam.

Slaughter continues to tour and in 2017 they are scheduled to appear on the Monsters of Rock cruise and at Rocklahoma along with several other scheduled concerts.

<text>A scrip (or &quot;&quot; in India) is any substitute for legal tender. It is often a form of credit. Scrips have been created and used for a variety of reasons, including exploitative payment of employees under truck systems; or for use in local commerce at times when regular currency was unavailable, for example in remote coal towns, military bases, ships on long voyages, or occupied countries in wartime. Besides company scrip, other forms of scrip include land scrip, vouchers, token coins such as subway tokens, IOUs, arcade tokens and tickets, and points on some credit cards.

Scrips have gained historical importance and become a subject of study in numismatics and exonumia due to their wide variety and recurring use. Scrip behaves similarly to a currency, and as such can be used to study monetary economics.

==History==
A variety of forms of scrip were used at various times in the 19th and 20th centuries.

=== Company scrip ===

Company scrip is a substitute for currency to pay a company&#x27;s employees. 

In United States mining or logging camps where everything was owned and operated by a single company, scrip provided the workers with credit when their wages had been depleted. These remote locations were cash poor. Workers had very little choice but to purchase food and other goods at a company store. In this way, the company could charge enormous markups on goods, making workers completely dependent on the company, thus enforcing a form of loyalty to the company. Additionally, while employees could exchange scrip for cash, this could rarely be done at face value. This kind of scrip was valid only within the settlement where it was issued. While store owners in neighboring communities could accept the scrip as money, they rarely did so at face value, as it was worth less.

When U.S. President Andrew Jackson issued his Specie Circular of 1836 due to credit shortages, Virginia Scrip was accepted as payment for federal lands.

In the 19th century, the federal government in Western Canada offered money scrip (valued at $160 or $240) or land scrip, valued at or , to Métis people in exchange for their Aboriginal rights.

During the Great Depression, at the height of the crisis, many local governments paid employees in scrip. Vermilion, Alberta was just one example.

In the U.S., payment of wages in scrip became illegal under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.

The expression &quot;scrip&quot; is also used in the stock market where companies can sometimes pay dividends in the form of additional shares/stock rather than in money. It is also a written document that acknowledges debt.

After World War I and World War II, scrip was used as &quot;notgeld&quot; (&quot;emergency money&quot;) in Germany and Austria.

Scrip was used extensively in prisoner-of-war camps during World War II, at least in countries that complied with the Third Geneva Convention. Under the Geneva Conventions, enlisted prisoners of war could be made to work and had to be paid for their labor, but not necessarily in cash. Since ordinary money could be used in escape attempts, they were given scrip that could only be used with the approval of camp authorities, usually only within the camps. 

Poker chips, also referred to as casino tokens, are commonly used as money with which to gamble. The use of chips as company money in the early 19th century in Devon, England, in the Wheal Friendship copper mine gave its name to a local village of Chipshop.
=== Stamp scrip ===
Stamp scrip was a type of local money designed to be circulated and not to be hoarded. 

One type of this worked this way. Each scrip certificate had printed boxes; every month a stamp costing a certain amount (in a typical case, 1% of the face value) had to be purchased and recorded in a box, otherwise the scrip lost all its value. This provided a great incentive to spend the scrip quickly. The scheme was used successfully in Germany and Austria in the early 1930s, after national currencies collapsed. National governments considered themselves threatened by the success of stamp scrip projects, and shut them down; similar misgivings discouraged their later use elsewhere.

The Alberta Social Credit Party government in 1937 issued prosperity certificates, a form of provincial currency, in an effort to encourage spending. This scrip had boxes in which a stamp equal to 2% of the value had to be affixed each week. Thus, the value of the certificate was covered by the cost of the stamps at the year&#x27;s end when it matured.

==Modern usage==
Scrip survives in modern times in various forms.

===Community-issued scrip===

The use of locally issued scrip accepted by multiple businesses within a community increased during the late-2000s recession. Community-wide scrip usage has begun or is on the rise in Ithaca, New York; Detroit; The Berkshires; Pittsboro, North Carolina; Traverse City, Michigan; Lamar, Colorado; Calgary, Canada; Bristol, UK; and Hagen, Germany.

Breadcoin scrip was created in Washington DC in 2016 to address food insecurity.

Thailand&#x27;s township Amphoe Kut Chum once issued its own local scrip called &quot;Bia Kut Chum&quot;: Bia is Thai for cowry shell, which was once used as small change, and still so used in metaphorical expressions. To side-step implications that the community intended their scrip as an unlawful substitute for currency, it now issues exchange coupons called &quot;Boon&quot; Kut Chum.

===Company-issued customer scrip===
Some companies still issue scrip notes and token coin, good for use at company points of sale. Among these are the Canadian Tire money for the Canadian Tire stores and gasbars in Canada, and Disney Dollars (no longer printed, but still accepted), in circulation at The Magic Kingdoms and at other establishments owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company.

===Scrip gift cards and gift certificates===

In the retail and fundraising industries, scrip is now issued in the form of gift cards, eCards, or less commonly paper gift certificates. Physical gift cards often have a magnetic strip or optically readable bar code to facilitate redemption at the point of sale.

In the late 1980s, the term scrip evolved to include a fundraising method popular with non-profit organizations like schools, bands and athletic groups. With scrip fundraising, retailers offer the gift certificates and gift cards to non-profit organizations at a discount. The non-profit organizations sell the gift cards to member&#x27;s families at full face value. The families redeem the gift cards at full face value, and the discount or rebate is retained by the non-profit organization as revenue.

===Commercial gift cards===

Visa, Mastercard and American Express gift cards are initially funded by a credit card or bank account, after which the funding account and gift card are not connected to one another. Once the predetermined funds are consumed, the card number expires. A gift of a gift card, maybe in an attractive wrapper, may be seen as more socially acceptable than a gift of cash. It also prevents the gift being spent on something the giver views as undesirable (or used as savings).

However, unless the gift card is obtained at a discount (paying less than the actual value of the card), buying scrip with ordinary money is arguably pointless, as it then ties up the money until it is used, and usually it may only be used at one store. Furthermore, not all gift cards issued are redeemed. In 2006, the value of unredeemed gift cards was estimated at almost US$8 billion.

Another disadvantage of gift cards is that some issuers charge &quot;maintenance fees&quot; on the cards, particularly if they are not used after a certain period of time; or the card will expire after a given period of time. Some provinces and states in North America (e.g. California, Ontario, Massachusetts, Ohio, Washington) have enacted laws to eliminate non-use fees or expirations, but because the laws often only apply to single-merchant cards buyers have to review the gift card conditions prior to purchase to determine exact restrictions and fees. Additionally, if a retailer goes bankrupt, gift cards can suddenly become worthless. Even if stores do not close immediately, the company may stop accepting the cards. This became a significant issue during the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, prompting the Consumers Union to call upon the Federal Trade Commission to regulate the issue.

==Land scrip (United States)==
Land scrip was a right to purchase federal public domain land in the United States, a common form of investment in the 19th century. As a type of federal aid to local governments or private corporations, Congress would grant land in lieu of cash. Most of the time the grantee did not seek to acquire any actual land but rather would sell the right to claim the land to private investors in the form of scrip. Often the land title was finalized only after the scrip was resold several times utilizing land agents also called warrant brokers. These grants came in the form of railroad land grants, university land grants, and grants to veterans for war service.

== Land scrip (Canada) ==
In 19th-century Western Canada, the federal government devised a system of land grants. Notes in the form of money scrip (valued at $160 or $240) or land scrip, valued at or , were offered to Métis people in exchange for their Aboriginal rights. Scrip was also issued to white settlers and members of the North-West Mounted Police. Land was claimed at a Dominion Lands Act office, often being far from where the Métis lived. The available land was located in northern Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Manitoba as opposed to the Métis&#x27; more southern homeland. Monetary scrip was also issued. Many Métis sold their scrip to land speculators at prices far below their actual worth, with estimates placing the amount of scrip sold as high as 12,560 (out of 14,849).

<text>A gift card, also known as a gift certificate in North America, or gift voucher or gift token in the UK, is a prepaid stored-value money card, usually issued by a retailer or bank, to be used as an alternative to cash for purchases within a particular store or related businesses. Gift cards are also given out by employers or organizations as rewards or gifts. They may also be distributed by retailers and marketers as part of a promotion strategy, to entice the recipient to come in or return to the store, and at times such cards are called cash cards. Gift cards are generally redeemable only for purchases at the relevant retail premises and cannot be cashed out, and in some situations may be subject to an expiry date or fees. American Express, MasterCard, and Visa offer generic gift cards which need not be redeemed at particular stores, and which are widely used for cashback marketing strategies. A feature of these cards is that they are generally anonymous and are disposed of when the stored value on a card is exhausted.

From the purchaser&#x27;s point of view, a gift card is a gift, given in place of an object which the recipient may not need, when the giving of cash as a present may be regarded as socially inappropriate. In the United States, gift cards are highly popular, ranking in 2006 as the second-most given gift by consumers, the most-wanted gift by women, and the third-most wanted by males. Gift cards have become increasingly popular as they relieve the donor of selecting a specific gift. In 2012, nearly 50% of all US consumers claimed to have purchased a gift card as a present during the holiday season. In Canada, $1.8 billion was spent on gift cards, and in the UK it is estimated to have reached £3 billion in 2009, whereas in the United States about US$80 billion was paid for gift cards in 2006. The recipient of a gift card can use it at their discretion within the restrictions set by the issue, for example as to validity period and businesses that accept a particular card.

Gift card sales are not limited to banks or retailers; such other companies as airlines, cruise ships, hotels, barber shops, train companies, theme parks, restaurants and other type of companies may offer gift cards as well.

==History==

In 1932 the Book Tokens scheme was established in UK by publisher Harry Raymond. The original format of the tokens was as &quot;lick-and-stick&quot; stamp-like vouchers, which were glued into gift cards and had to be removed by the bookseller redeeming the token. In the 1990s, this design was changed to a &quot;currency-style&quot; voucher, available in a number of different denominations.

In 1994 Neiman Marcus introduced the gift card system in US using a payments infrastructure in late 1994, though Blockbuster Entertainment was the first company to do so on a wide scale, test-marketing them in 1995 and launching them around the country the next year. In the beginning, the Blockbuster gift card replaced gift certificates that were being counterfeited with recently introduced color copiers and color printers. Blockbuster&#x27;s first gift card transactions were processed by what was then Nabanco of Sunrise, Florida. Nabanco was the developer of the first third-party platform for the processing of gift cards using existing payment infrastructure.

Neiman Marcus and Blockbuster were later followed by the Mobil gas card, which initially offered prepaid phone value provided by MCI. Kmart was next with the introduction of the Kmart Cash Card, which in the early generations provided prepaid phone time with AT&amp;T. Later Kmart and Mobil dropped this feature, as it was not profitable for them. The Kmart Cash Card was the first replacement for cash returns when a shopper did not have a receipt for a gift. This practice of giving a cash card in place of cash for non-receipted returns is commonplace today with most merchants. From these early introductions, other retailers began to adapt a giftcard program to replace their gift certificate programs.

==Function and types==

A gift card may resemble a credit card or display a specific theme on a plastic card the size of a credit card. The card is identified by a specific number or code, not usually with an individual name, and thus could be used by anybody. They are backed by an on-line electronic system for authorization. Some gift cards can be reloaded by payment and can be used thus multiple times.

Cards may have a serial number, barcode, magnetic strip, which is read by an electronic credit card machine. Many cards have no value until they are sold, at which time the cashier enters the amount which the customer wishes to put on the card. This amount is rarely stored on the card but is instead noted in the merchant&#x27;s database, which is cross linked to the card ID. Gift cards thus are generally not stored-value cards as used in many public transport systems or library photocopiers, where a simplified system with no network stores the value only on the card itself. To thwart counterfeiting, the data is encrypted. The magnetic strip is also often placed differently than on credit cards, so they cannot be read or written with standard equipment. Other gift cards may have a set value and need to be activated by calling a specific phone number.

Gift cards can also be individually custom tailored to meet specific needs. By adding a custom message or name on the front of the card, it can make for an individualized gift or be used as a gesture of appreciation towards an employee.

Gift cards are divided into open loop or network cards and closed loop cards. The former are issued by banks or credit card companies and can be redeemed by different merchants, the latter by a specific store or restaurant and can be only redeemed by the issuing provider. The latter, however, tend to have fewer problems with card value decay and fees. Card value decay is less of an issue since the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act was passed by the US Congress in 2009. Inactivity fees and card expirations are both limited by the new law.

In either case the giver would buy the gift card and may have to pay an additional purchase or activation fee, and the recipient of the card would use the value of the card at a later transaction. A third form is the hybrid closed loop card whose issuer has bundled a number of closed loop cards; an example is free gift cards for a specific shopping mall.

Gift cards differ from scrip gift certificates, in that the latter are usually sold as a paper document with an authorized signature by a restaurant, store, or other individual establishment as a voucher for a future service; there is no electronic authorization. A gift certificate may or may not have an expiration date and generally has no administrative fees.

Bank issued gift cards may be used in lieu of checks as a way to disburse rebate funds. Some retailers use the gift card system for refunds in lieu of cash thereby assuring that the customer will spend the funds at their store.

A charity gift card allows the gift giver to make a charitable donation and the gift recipient to choose a charity that will receive the donation.

Gift cards can also be country-specific, and can be used to access USA-specific programming and media when outside the United States.

===Mobile and virtual gift cards===
Mobile gift cards are delivered to mobile phones via email or SMS, and phone apps allow users to carry only their cell phone. 

Virtual gift cards are delivered via email to the recipient, the benefits being that they cannot be physically lost and that the consumer does not has to spend the additional time needed to buy a physical gift card in a brick and mortar store making it more convenient. Gift cards of this type can also be purchased quicker, which is especially attractive if a gifting occasion is on the horizon. 

Other companies have introduced virtual gift cards that users redeem on their smartphones. As the merchant is not involved in the loop, it is considered a cash transfer rather than a traditional gift card.

==Gift card collecting==
Gift cards can have many different designs, including for, holidays, special occasions, sports teams, cartoons, and more. Some hardcore collectors collect different variations of each card, and or prefer where the pin number is not scratched off. Even more desirable are brand new unused gift cards even ones still attached to the retail backers. Most gift cards are plastic, some variances include clear plastic, shaped cards, and paperboard cards. Recently most Starbucks and Chipotle gift cards are now paperboard instead of plastic. A partial list of popular retailers with collectors who have released gift cards worldwide with many different designs and or variations include:

* Aldi
* Applebee&#x27;s
* Barnes &amp; Noble
* Best Buy
* Burger King
* Chick-fil-A
* Chili&#x27;s
* Chipotle
* CVS
* Dollar Tree
* Dunkin&#x27; Donuts
* Firehouse Subs
* GameStop
* Home Depot
* IHOP
* In-N-Out Burger
* Jack in the Box
* JCPenney
* Kmart
* Krispy Kreme
* McDonald&#x27;s
* Olive Garden
* Panera Bread
* Perkins
* Qdoba
* Red Lobster
* Red Robin
* Schlotzsky&#x27;s
* Sears
* Sonic
* Starbucks
* Steak &#x27;n Shake
* Subway
* Target
* Tim Hortons
* Toys &quot;R&quot; Us
* Walmart
* Wendy&#x27;s
According to the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, the largest gift card collection in the world, as of 2021, belonged to Canadian-American brothers Aaron and David Miller of Scarsdale, New York. By 2013, the brothers had amassed an estimated 3,125 different cards.

In addition, some online collecting websites have pages dedicated to gift card listings for collectors.

==Pitfalls==
It has been argued that holiday giving destroys value due to mismatching gifts. The most efficient way to keep value in gifting would be to give cash; however, giving cash in most cultures is not socially acceptable, except with children. Gift cards, to a degree, may overcome this problem, but have certain pitfalls. Some feel that the absence of the thought of selecting a specific gift makes a gift card a worse choice than a poorly executed but individual gift. New products in the gift card industry are evolving to tackle this &quot;impersonal&quot; pitfall of gift cards; new services launched by some service providers allows for customization and personalization of gift cards.

Gift cards have been criticized for the issuers ability to set rules that are detrimental to the purchaser or card recipient. For example, gift cards may be subject to an expiry date, administrative fees, restrictions on use, and absence of adequate protection in case of fraud or loss. Over time fees may render the value of a gift card zero. However, these issues have been addressed in recent years in some jurisdictions. In the United States, many jurisdictions limit or prohibit all fees or expiration dates for gift cards. Furthermore, because of the negative impact on sales that such policies can have, most merchants have adopted and even advertise a no fee, no expiration policy for their gift cards, whether or not state laws require it. In 2011, an estimated 2.5% of gift cards were subject to an expiration date and 2.7% to post sale fees.

A quarter of gift card recipients still have not spent gift cards a year after receiving them, according to a Consumer Reports survey, and a majority of people say they end up spending more than the value of the card once they get to the store. On the other hand, consumers may try to use as much of a gift card as possible while avoiding spending money out of pocket, usually resulting in small values remaining on the card. Consumer laws in some places have addressed this. In Australia, a gift card can be exchanged for cash if there is a remaining amount that the business believes can&#x27;t be &quot;conveniently used.&quot;

In the event of the bankruptcy of the issuing retailer, the outstanding value on gift cards is considered unsecured debt, and as such gift cards may become valueless. If the company intends to continue trading, gift cards may be honoured even in bankruptcy.

===Use in fraud===
Another issue regarding gift cards is the growing concerns from retailers and other businesses about what can be done to prevent gift cards from being exploited by fraudsters. Gift card information can either be stolen from their rightful owners by fraudsters or they can be purchased with stolen credit card information. In recent years, cyber criminals have increased their efforts to take advantage of fraudulent gift cards as they are simple to exploit with automated brute-force bot attacks. The most common form of gift card fraud is committed through the act of stealing card information for activated cards with an existing balance by attacking a retailer&#x27;s systems which store gift card data. Once a gift card has been compromised, the fraudster will then check the balance through online customer portals before using the funds or reselling on the secondary gift card market.

Digital scammers sometimes trick victims into buying gift cards, which are then stolen. For the scammer, they have the advantage of being completely untraceable.

In 2023, the Federal Bureau of Investigation warned the public regarding gift cards which appear to have a sticker placed over the barcode. The United States Department of Homeland Security launched Project Red Hook due to the billions of dollars of gift card losses generated by Chinese organized crime.

==Redemption rate==

Not all gift cards are redeemed. The card may be lost, there may be time decay expiration and fees or complex rules of redemption, or the recipient may not be interested in the store that accepts the card or be under the false assumption that not using it will save money for the giver. It has been estimated that perhaps 10% of cards are not redeemed, amounting to a gain for retailers of about $8 billion in the United States in 2006.

In 2012, over $100 billion in gift cards were expected to be purchased in the United States, where over 20% of those gift cards expected to go unredeemed or unused. This has amassed a large opportunity in the secondary market, similar to the secondary ticket market in the early 2000s. Some companies have created a business in the secondary gift card market that allow consumers to sell their unused gift cards or buy discounted gift cards to their favorite brands. This has helped their users recoup their share of some $55 million per day that goes unredeemed in the United States every year.

==Regulations==

=== Canada ===
All Canadian provinces have legislations passed to ban expiry dates and fees collected on gift cards. However, provincial gift card legislations do not apply to sectors that are regulated under federal laws. For example, gift cards that resemble credit cards i.e. with American Express, MasterCard, or Visa branding and phone cards are regulated by the federal government. Under the federal &quot;Prepaid Payment Products Regulations&quot;, effective 1 May 2014, federally regulated gift cards may only charge maintenance fees under certain conditions and may not set an expiry date for funds on those cards.

=== United States ===
In the past, uniform standards concerning gift cards did not exist. This was set to change as an addendum to the Credit CARD Act of 2009 directs the federal government to create consumer-friendly standards pertaining to gift cards. Most notably, the new regulations prohibit retailers from setting expiration dates unless they are at least five years after the card&#x27;s date of issue or the date on which funds were last added to the card. In addition, retailers are no longer able to assess dormancy, inactivity, or service fees unless the card has been inactive for at least 12 months, and if fees are added after that period, the details of such fees must be clearly disclosed on the card. Additionally, retailers are unable to levy more than one fee per month. The new provisions took effect on 22 August 2010.

Open loop cards are governed by rules of the Comptroller of the Currency; however, oversight has been criticized. Closed loop gift cards are subject to rules set by different state regulations, and issuing authorities vary widely in the rules they set for the consumer. Moreover, rules can be changed by the issuer without notifying the consumer.

<doc id="743077" wikidata="Q303172" url="?curid=743077" title="White-throated treecreeper">
<text>The white-throated treecreeper (Cormobates leucophaea) is an Australian treecreeper found in the forests of eastern Australia. It is unrelated to the northern hemisphere treecreepers. It is a small passerine bird with predominantly brown and white plumage and measuring some 15 cm (6 in) long on average. It is insectivorous, eating mainly ants. Unlike treecreepers of the genus &quot;Climacteris&quot;, the white-throated treecreeper does not engage in cooperative breeding, and wherever it overlaps with species of that genus, it feeds upon much looser bark besides typically using different trees.

==Taxonomy==
It was first described by ornithologist John Latham in 1801 as &quot;Certhia leucophaea&quot;. For many years it was classified in the genus &quot;Climacteris&quot;.

The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;kormos&quot; &#x27;trunk of a tree&#x27;, and &#x27;batēs&#x27; from the verb &#x27;to go&#x27; or &#x27;to travel&#x27;, and refers to its mode of walking up and down trees. Its specific name is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;leuko-&quot; &#x27;white&#x27; and &quot;phaios&quot; &#x27;dun&#x27; or &#x27;dusky&#x27;, and refers to its plumage. Some guidebooks have the binomial name written as &quot;Cormobates leucophaeus&quot;, however a review in 2001 rules that the genus name was feminine, hence &quot;leucophaea&quot; is the correct specific name.

The Papuan treecreeper (&quot;Cormobates placens&quot;) was previously considered a subspecies but is now recognized as a separate species, although molecular studies have yet to be done on the two taxa.

===Subspecies===
Five subspecies are recognised:

*&quot;C. l. leucophaea&quot;, the nominate subspecies, occurs in southeastern Australia, from southeastern South Australia, through Victoria to south and central eastern New South Wales.
*&quot;C. l. grisescens&quot; is found in the Mount Lofty Ranges of South Australia.
*&quot;C. l. intermedius&quot;, described in 1983 by Walter Boles and Wayne Longmore, is restricted to the Clark and Connors Ranges in Central Queensland.
*&quot;C. l. metastasis&quot;, described by Richard Schodde in 1989, is found in southeastern Queensland and northeastern New South Wales.
*&quot;C. l. minor&quot; occurs in northern Queensland. It was originally described by Edward Pierson Ramsay in 1891 after being collected near Cairns.

==Description==

Measuring 13–17 cm (5–7 in) in length with a wingspan of , averaging , and averaging 22 g (0.8 oz) in weight, it has a white throat and breast and barred dark-brown and white belly and flanks. The upperparts and wings are a dark greyish brown, with a buff patch visible on the wings. Unlike other treecreepers, it does not have a pale eyebrow. The bill and feet are black. The female has a pale orange-brown patch on the cheek. Immature birds have an orange-brown rump and white markings on the scapulars. 
The call is a shrill peeping.

==Distribution and habitat==
The white-throated treecreeper is found from the Gulf St Vincent in South Australia, through Victoria, and eastern New South Wales and southeastern Queensland, with an area further north from Mount Spec to Cooktown. Wet sclerophyll forest and rainforest is the preferred habitat.

It is Protected in Australia under the National Parks and Wildlife Act, 1974.

==Feeding==
The white-throated treecreeper is predominantly insectivorous, eating mainly ants, although will eat also nectar. A 2007 study in the Australian Capital Territory showed the white-throated treecreeper preferred foraging on the rough-barked eucalypt, the red stringybark (&quot;Eucalyptus macrorhyncha&quot;), rather than the smooth barked species, the inland scribbly gum (&quot;Eucalyptus rossii&quot;). Birds would glean (take prey while bird is perched) and peer, as well as drill in dead wood, for insects. A female was observed feeding on white punk (&quot;Laetiporus portentosus&quot;), a bracket fungus.

==Breeding==

Unlike treecreepers of the genus &quot;Climacteris&quot;, the white-throated treecreeper does not engage in cooperative breeding. The breeding season is August to December with one brood laid. The cup-shaped nest is composed of fur, hair, feathers, and moss in a hollow in a tree above the ground. A clutch of two or three creamy-white oval eggs is laid. Sparsely spotted with dark purple- or red-brown, they measure 23 x 18 mm.

<text>The Achelous (, &quot;Akhelôios&quot;), also Acheloos, is a river in Epirus, western Greece. It is long. It formed the boundary between Acarnania and Aetolia of antiquity. It empties into the Ionian Sea. In ancient times its spirit was venerated as the river god Achelous.

Herodotus, taking notice of the shoreline-transforming power of the Acheloos River, even compared it to the Nile in this respect:
:&#x27;There are other rivers as well which, though not as large as the Nile, have had substantial results. In particular (although I could name others), there is the Achelous, which flows through Acarnania into the sea and has already turned half the Echinades islands into mainland.&#x27; (2.10, trans. Waterfield)

It is said to have been called more anciently &quot;Thoas&quot;, &quot;Axenus&quot; and &quot;Thestius&quot;.

==Course==

The river Achelous begins at about elevation on the eastern slope of Lakmos mountain in the Pindus range, near the village Anthousa in the westernmost part of the Trikala regional unit. One of its first tributaries is the Aspropotamos, meaning the white river.

The river flows generally southwards, and forms part of the boundary between the regional units of Arta and Trikala, which is also the boundary between Epirus and Thessaly. Further downstream, it forms the boundary of Arta and Karditsa, and further of Aetolia-Acarnania and Evrytania. The river runs into the Kremasta reservoir, which is also fed by the rivers Agrafiotis and Megdovas.

On exiting the Kremasta reservoir, the river flows southwest into Aetolia-Acarnania, feeding the Kastraki reservoir, west of the Panaitoliko range. downstream from this lake, it flows into the Stratos reservoir. Further downstream, it runs through the lowlands west of Agrinio. It finally empties into the Ionian Sea, west of Missolonghi.

== Settlements ==
In order from upstream to downstream:
* Katafyto
* Gardiki
* Mesochora
* Koryfi
* Myrofyllo
* Petroto
* Grimpiana
* Mesopyrgos
* Neo Argyri
* Tripotamo
* Kastraki
* Stratos
* Palaiomanina
* Gouria
* Neochori

===Dams===
There are five dams on the river. From upstream to downstream there is the Mesochora Dam which was completed in 2001 but has not impounded its reservoir. Below that is the Sykia Dam which is partly constructed. Further down is the Kremasta (1965), Kastraki (1969) and Stratos Dams (1989).

==Acheloos River in mythology==

==History==
In antiquity, the Achelous was the largest and most celebrated river in Greece, rising in Mount Pindus, and after flowing through the mountainous country of the Dolopians and Agraeans, entered the plain of Acarnania and Aetolia near Stratus, and discharged itself into the Ionian Sea, near the Acarnanian town of Oeniadae. It subsequently formed the boundary between Acarnania and Aetolia, but in the time of Thucydides the territory of Oeniadae extended east of the river. It is usually called a river of Acarnania, but it is sometimes assigned to Aetolia. Its general direction is from north to south. Its waters are of a whitish yellow or cream colour, whence it derives a later name of &quot;Aspropotamo&quot; or the White river, and to which Dionysius Periegetes probably alludes in the epithet ἀργυροδίνης. Periegetes places the sources of the river near a place called Chalcis. It is said to have been called more anciently Thoas, Axenus and Thestius. In the lower part of its course, the plain through which it flows was called in antiquity Paracheloitis after the river. This plain was celebrated for its fertility, though covered in great part with marshes, several of which were formed by the overflowings of the Achelous.

In 1359 the Battle of Achelous between Albanian forces under Peter Losha and the Despotate of Epirus under Nikephoros II Orsini took place near the river Achelous. Nikephoros II was defeated and killed during the battle, and two new states were established in the area, the Despotate of Arta and the Despotate of Angelokastron and Lepanto.

In the 1960s, the Kremasta Dam in the Aitoloacarnania-Evrytania boundary was under construction. The area is not forested. The dam, made of concrete, took years to complete, eventually flooding a portion of the western part of the prefecture of Eurytania. The dam includes a power station with transformer lines in the east. The dam powers electricity for the western part of Greece and the central part. It caused some soil erosion in some flooded valleys. The Kastraki Dam is downstream and was completed in 1969. Downstream of Katsiki, the Stratos Dam was completed in 1989. The arch bridges includes the Karafilio and the Ardanovo.

The Acheloos River Diversion project has been the center of debate since the 1980s. It calls for four large dams, the Sykia, Mesochora, Mouzaki and Pyli, along with a channel. The goal of the project is to divert annually from the river west towards the Thessaly plains in order to help irrigate of mostly cotton crops. Construction on the project has been stalled several times, the latest in 2005, because of environmental and social concerns.

<text>The cheroot is a filterless cylindrical cigar with both ends clipped during manufacture. Since cheroots do not taper, they are inexpensive to roll mechanically, and their low cost makes them popular.

The word &#x27;cheroot&#x27; probably comes via Portuguese &quot;charuto&quot;, originally from Tamil &quot;curuttu/churuttu/shuruttu&quot; (சுருட்டு), &quot;roll of tobacco&quot;. This word could have been absorbed into the French language from Tamil during the 18th century, when the French were trying to stamp their presence in South India. The word could have then been absorbed into English from French. Cheroots are originated from the city of Tiruchirappalli in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Cheroot are longer than another filter-less Indian-origin product, the beedi.

==Asia==

Cheroots are traditional in Myanmar and India, and consequently were popular among the British during the days of the British Empire. They are often associated with Myanmar in literature:

Apparently, cheroot smoking was also associated with resistance against tropical disease in India. Verrier Elwin wrote in a foreword (1957) to &quot;Leaves from the Jungle: Life in a Gond Village&quot;:

Although a cheroot is defined as cylindrical, home-rolled cheroots in Myanmar are sometimes conical.

<text>In Scientology, an implant is a form of thought insertion, similar to an engram but done deliberately and with evil intent. It is &quot;an intentional installation of fixed ideas, contra-survival to the thetan&quot;.

The intention in the original engram or incident is to implant an idea or emotion or sensation, regarding some phenomenon etc. The intention in Scientology and Dianetics is to erase the compulsive or command effect of the idea, emotion, sensation, etc. so that the person can make a rational judgment and decision in the affected areas of life.

Scientology practices often have to do with addressing implants prior to the current lifetime — one of the most notable is the &quot;R6 implant&quot;; but in some cases current life implants are addressed. Examples of implants according to Scientology include Aversion therapy, Electroconvulsive therapy, hypnosis, various attempts at brainwashing, and the inducing of fear or terror. Note that this is not a complete list, as many kinds of incidents can include implants as an element.

Other important implants in Scientology doctrine include the Helatrobus implants, which Hubbard claimed occurred 382 trillion years ago to 52 trillion years ago by an alien nation called the Helatrobans, who sought to restrain human minds by capturing and brainwashing thetans. These implants are said to be responsible for the concept of Heaven.

<text>The Aconcagua River is a river in Chile that rises from the conflux of two minor tributary rivers at above sea level in the Andes, Juncal River from the east (which rise in the Nevado Juncal) and Blanco River from the south east. The Aconcagua river flows westward through the broad Aconcagua valley and enters the Pacific Ocean near the city of Concon, north of Valparaíso.

The river has a course of about , and its waters irrigate the most populous sections of the Chilean provinces of San Felipe de Aconcagua and Los Andes, being the most important economic resource of those regions. During the course of the Aconcagua river, it receives contributions from many others rivers and swamps, reaching a mean flow of .

The Aconcagua River valley was used as the route of the Transandine Railway on the Chilean side. The river flows alongside Chile Route 5 from Llaillay to La Calera. For much of their lengths, the two separate stretches of Chile Route 60 follow the course of the river.

Although it has the same name, the Aconcagua river does not rise in the slopes of Aconcagua, which is entirely in Argentina about from the beginning of the river, in Chilean territory.

The invasive plant species &quot;Limnobium laevigatum&quot; is present in the river.

<text>Louis Augustin Guillaume Bosc (or Louis-Augustin Bosc d&#x27;Antic) (29 January 1759 – 10 July 1828) was a French botanist, invertebrate zoologist, and entomologist.

==Biography==
Bosc was born in Paris, the son of Paul Bosc d’Antic, a medical doctor and chemist. He studied at Dijon, where he was the pupil of botanist Jean-François Durande and chemist Louis-Bernard Guyton-Morveau. Being unable to become an artilleryman, he worked initially for the office of the controller general and then for the comptroller of the postal service. In time he took courses in botany under Antoine-Laurent de Jussieu and met botanist René Desfontaines and naturalist Pierre Marie Auguste Broussonet. He also took up with Jean Marie Roland and Madame Roland and formed a lasting relationship with Danish entomologist Johan Christian Fabricius. While working for the postal service he carried out work on natural history, publishing a description of a new species of bug, &quot;Orthezia characias&quot;, and a method of preserving insect larvae.

In 1785 Bosc was invited to join the Lapérouse round the world expedition as a naturalist, but declined. This was fortunate for him, as the expedition was lost after leaving Botany Bay in March 1788. Together with André Thouin, Pierre Marie Auguste Broussonet, Aubin-Louis Millin de Grandmaison and Pierre Willemet, Bosc participated, in 1787, in the founding of the first Linnean society in the world, the &quot;Société linnéenne de Paris&quot;. They were soon joined by other naturalists. This society was dissolved in 1789, in part due to hostility from the established Académie Royale des Sciences. Both Bosc and Broussonet were among the first foreign members of the Linnean Society of London.
After the Storming of the Bastille in 1789, new laws in France permitted freedom of the press and assembly, allowing the formation of new societies, newspapers and journals. Among these was the Société d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle, founded in 1790 in Bosc&#x27;s Home. Its journal, &quot;Actes de la société d&#x27;histoire naturelle de Paris&quot; was short-lived, but included a number of items by Bosc.. Both Bosc and the Society were politically active, with Republican leanings. Bosc was a member of the Jacobin Club. He was also an active member of the Philomatic Society of Paris.

His friendship with Roland allowed Bosc to rise to a substantial position, but when that minister fell into disgrace he was dismissed on 31 May 1793. Bosc left Paris, and lived as a country former in the forest of Montmorency. He sheltered several people persecuted by the Terror, including Roland and Louis-Marie de La Révellière-Lépeaux. It was at this time he became tutor to Eudora Roland, Roland&#x27;s daughter. La Réveliière-Lépeaux, having become a member of the &quot;Directoire&quot;, allowed Bosc to leave for the United States, first as vice-consul to Wilmington in 1797, then as consul to New York in 1798. Upon his return to France, he published &quot;Memoire sur quelques especes des champignons des parties meridionales de l&#x27;Amerique septentrionale&quot; (1811). This work was the first-ever systematic examination of the mushrooms of the southern United States, and established Bosc as the founder of mycology in that region.

Bosc was brought back to France, where he served for a time as administrator of hospitals and prisons and obtained, in 1803, after a sojourn in Switzerland and Italy courtesy of Georges Cuvier, a position in the gardens and nurseries of Versailles. He gave his collections to his naturalist friends. Thus, Fabricius and Guillaume-Antoine Olivier received his insects; François Marie Daudin, his birds; Pierre André Latreille, his reptiles; and the comte de Lacépède, his fish. He was also the friend and protector of naturalists Jean-Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent and Jean-Marie Léon Dufour.

In 1806, he was elected to membership in the &quot;Académie des sciences&quot; in the rural husbandry section. In 1825, he succeeded André Thouin to the chair of plant culture at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris.

He died unexpectedly not many years later in Paris, in 1828.

==Legacy==
Bosc&#x27;s legacy lies mainly in the fields of agronomy and natural history. He was the author of three volumes of &quot;Suites à Buffon&quot;, edited by René Richard Louis Castel: &quot;Histoire naturelle des Coquilles&quot; (Paris, 5 volumes, 1802); &quot;Histoire naturelle des Vers&quot; (Paris, 3 volumes, 1802); and &quot;Histoire naturelle des Crustacés&quot; (Paris, 2 volumes, 1802).

Bosc participated in the editing of the &quot;Nouveau Dictionnaire d&#x27;histoire naturelle appliquée aux arts, principalement à l&#x27;agriculture, à l&#x27;économie rurale et domestique&quot;, under the direction of Jean-François-Pierre Deterville and Sonnini de Manoncourt (Paris, 24 volumes, 1803–1804, re-edited in 36 volumes, 1816–1819), and the &quot;Nouveau Cours complet d&#x27;agriculture théorique et pratique&quot;, also directed by Deterville (Paris, 13 volumes, 1809, re-edited in 16 volumes, 1821–1823). Bosc also supervised the editing and republication of the agricultural classic, &quot;Théâtre d&#x27;agriculture&quot; (1600) by Olivier de Serres, published by the &quot;Société centrale d&#x27;agriculture de Paris&quot;, whose &quot;Annales&quot; he also published.

Notton (2007) provides a catogue of parasitic wasps with reference to Bosc&#x27;s collection. Dolan (2020) gives a full bibliography of Bosc&#x27;s publications, and a list of all the species described by him.

Bosc&#x27;s grave lies in a little cemetery in the forest of Montmorency, a National Forest open to the public, in the commune of Saint-Prix in the Val-d&#x27;Oise.

Bosc&#x27;s insect collection is shared between the Natural History Museum of Geneva, Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle in Paris, and the Natural History Museum in London (Louis Alexandre Auguste Chevrolat collection).

Bosc is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of lizard, &quot;Acanthodactylus boskianus&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, given two partially ordered sets &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;, a function &quot;f&quot;: &quot;P&quot; → &quot;Q&quot; between them is Scott-continuous (named after the mathematician Dana Scott) if it preserves all directed suprema. That is, for every directed subset &quot;D&quot; of &quot;P&quot; with supremum in &quot;P&quot;, its image has a supremum in &quot;Q&quot;, and that supremum is the image of the supremum of &quot;D&quot;, i.e. formula_1, where formula_2 is the directed join. When formula_3 is the poset of truth values, i.e. Sierpiński space, then Scott-continuous functions are characteristic functions of open sets, and thus Sierpiński space is the classifying space for open sets.

A subset &quot;O&quot; of a partially ordered set &quot;P&quot; is called Scott-open if it is an upper set and if it is inaccessible by directed joins, i.e. if all directed sets &quot;D&quot; with supremum in &quot;O&quot; have non-empty intersection with &quot;O&quot;. The Scott-open subsets of a partially ordered set &quot;P&quot; form a topology on &quot;P&quot;, the Scott topology. A function between partially ordered sets is Scott-continuous if and only if it is continuous with respect to the Scott topology.

The Scott topology was first defined by Dana Scott for complete lattices and later defined for arbitrary partially ordered sets.

Scott-continuous functions are used in the study of models for lambda calculi and the denotational semantics of computer programs.

==Properties==
A Scott-continuous function is always monotonic, meaning that if formula_4 for formula_5, then formula_6.

A subset of a directed complete partial order is closed with respect to the Scott topology induced by the partial order if and only if it is a lower set and closed under suprema of directed subsets.

A directed complete partial order (dcpo) with the Scott topology is always a Kolmogorov space (i.e., it satisfies the T0 separation axiom). However, a dcpo with the Scott topology is a Hausdorff space if and only if the order is trivial. The Scott-open sets form a complete lattice when ordered by inclusion.

For any Kolmogorov space, the topology induces an order relation on that space, the specialization order: if and only if every open neighbourhood of &quot;x&quot; is also an open neighbourhood of &quot;y&quot;. The order relation of a dcpo &quot;D&quot; can be reconstructed from the Scott-open sets as the specialization order induced by the Scott topology. However, a dcpo equipped with the Scott topology need not be sober: the specialization order induced by the topology of a sober space makes that space into a dcpo, but the Scott topology derived from this order is finer than the original topology.

==Examples==
The open sets in a given topological space when ordered by inclusion form a lattice on which the Scott topology can be defined. A subset &quot;X&quot; of a topological space &quot;T&quot; is compact with respect to the topology on &quot;T&quot; (in the sense that every open cover of &quot;X&quot; contains a finite subcover of &quot;X&quot;) if and only if the set of open neighbourhoods of &quot;X&quot; is open with respect to the Scott topology.

For CPO, the cartesian closed category of dcpo&#x27;s, two particularly notable examples of Scott-continuous functions are curry and apply.

Nuel Belnap used Scott continuity to extend logical connectives to a four-valued logic.

<text>Ramsar () is a city in the Central District of Ramsar County, Mazandaran province, Iran, serving as capital of both the county and the district.

==History==
In 1971, Ramsar hosted the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, also known as the Convention on Wetlands. This international treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of designated wetlands (which under the treaty are known as Ramsar sites) was signed in and named after the city of Ramsar.

==Overview==
Ramsar lies on the Caspian Sea. It was also known as Sakhtsar in the past. The climate of Ramsar is hot and humid in summer and mild in winter. The proximity of the forest and the sea in this city attracts tourists in all seasons. Ramsar has an airport. The city of Ramsar was a small village in western Mazandaran until the Qajar period, and during the first Pahlavi period, with the rule of Reza Shah and with the support of the government, it became a city with many tourist facilities.

Ramsar is the westernmost county and city in Mazandaran. It borders the Caspian Sea to the north, Rudsar county of Gilan province to the west, Qazvin Province to the south, and Tonekabon to the east.

==Demographics==
===Language and ethnicity===
The Gilaks form the majority of the city&#x27;s population. Their dialect of Gilaki is similar to that found in eastern Gilan and belongs to the Eastern or Bie-Pish branch.

===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 31,659 in 9,241 households. The following census in 2011 counted 32,294 people in 10,432 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 35,997 people in 12,153 households.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Ramsar has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;Cf&quot;), with warm, humid summers and cool, damp winters. Ramsar is the cloudiest city in Iran, as well as one of the cloudiest cities of this latitude, with annual sunshine of around 1582 hours. Northern Iran, as well as most portions of Iran, is separated by mountains. As a result, the air in Tehran is very dry. When driving to Ramsar from Tehran, one drives up the mountains until arriving at a tunnel. On passing through this tunnel and coming out the other side, the environment is very different; it is more humid and green due to moisture from the Caspian Sea, and this abundance of mist and rain is part of the attraction for tourists from the desert zones of Iran.


===Radioactivity===

Ramsar&#x27;s Talesh Mahalleh district is the most radioactive inhabited area known on Earth, due to nearby hot springs and building materials originating from around them. A combined population of 2,000 residents from this district and other high radiation neighborhoods receive an average radiation dose of 10 mSv per year, ten times more than the ICRP-recommended limit for exposure to the public from artificial sources.

Record levels were found in a house where the effective radiation dose due to external radiation was 131 mSv/a, and the committed dose from radon was 72 mSv/a. This unique case is over 80 times higher than the world average background radiation.

One of the most commonly used models of radiation-induced cancer posits that the risk rises linearly with dose at a rate of 5% per Sv. If this linear no-threshold model is correct, it should be possible to observe an increased incidence of cancer in Ramsar through careful long-term studies currently underway. Early anecdotal evidence from local doctors and preliminary cytogenetic studies suggested that there may be no such harmful effect, and possibly even a radio-adaptive effect. More recent epidemiological data show a slightly reduced lung cancer rate and non-significantly elevated morbidity, but the small size of the population (only 1800 inhabitants in the highest-irradiated areas) will require a longer monitoring period to draw definitive conclusions.

Furthermore, there are questions regarding possible non-cancer effects of the radiation background. An Iranian study has shown that people in the area have a significantly higher expression of the CD69 gene and a higher incidence of stable and unstable chromosomal aberrations. Chromosomal aberrations have been found in other studies. Pending further study, the potential health risks had moved scientists in 2001–02 to call for relocation of the residents and regulatory control of new construction.

The radioactivity is due to the local geology. Underground water dissolves radium in uraniferous igneous rock and carries it to the surface through at least nine known hot springs. These are used as spas by locals and tourists. Some of the radium precipitates into travertine, a form of limestone, and the rest diffuses into the soil, where it is absorbed by crops and mixes with drinking water. Residents have unknowingly used the radioactive limestone as a building material for their homes. The stone irradiates the inhabitants and generates radon gas which typically promotes lung cancer. Crops contribute 72 μSv/yr to a critical group of 50 residents.

===Environmental protection===
The Convention on Wetlands, signed in Ramsar in 1971, is an intergovernmental treaty which provides the framework for national action and international cooperation for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources. There are presently 160 contracting parties to the convention, with 1920 wetland sites, totaling , designated for inclusion in the Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance. 
Presently, there are 160 contracting parties, up from 119 in 2000 and from 18 initial signatory nations in 1971. Signatories meet every three years as the Conference of the Contracting Parties (COP), the first held in Cagliari, Italy, in 1980. Amendments to the original convention have been agreed to in Paris (in 1982) and Regina, Canada (in 1987).

==Tourism==

Ramsar is a popular sea resort for Iranian tourists. The town also offers hot springs, the green forests of the Alborz Mountains, the vacation palace of the last Shah, and the Hotel Ramsar. south of Ramsar and above sea level in the Alborz mountains is Javaher Deh village, which is an important tourist attraction in Ramsar county. The road from Ramsar to Javaher Deh connects the city to Safarood forest park.

==Twin towns and sister cities==
Ramsar is twinned with:
* Puerto Montt, Chile (since 28 January 2009)
* Al Wakrah, Qatar (since 14 June 2010)
* Shiraz, Iran (since 9 January 2013)

<doc id="743142" wikidata="Q7991632" url="?curid=743142" title="What the Papers Say">
<text>What The Papers Say is a British radio and television series. It consists of quotations from headlines and comment pages in the previous week&#x27;s newspapers, read in a variety of voices and accents by actors. The quotes are linked by a script read by a studio presenter, usually a prominent journalist. The show did not have a regular host, and was intended as a wry look at how British broadsheets and tabloids covered the week&#x27;s news stories. The programme was most recently broadcast on BBC Radio 4.

&quot;What The Papers Say&quot; originally ran for many years on television – its first incarnation (1956–2008) was the second longest-running programme on British television after &quot;Panorama&quot;. Having begun in 1956 on Granada Television and ITV, the television series moved to newly launched Channel 4 in 1982 and being shown to the network before briefly returning to ITV as part of the new night service in 1988 and then to BBC2 in 1990 before being discontinued in 2008. The programme was revived on Radio 4 in the run-up to the 2010 general election, and continued until 27 March 2016, when it was announced that that was its last Radio 4 episode.

The programme&#x27;s format was the same for both television and radio. On TV, while quotes were being read, they would appear on-screen as newspaper cuttings under the relevant newspaper&#x27;s masthead, and the presenter would read a script from the auto-prompt operator.

== History ==
Throughout its history, the television series was editorially based in Manchester by Granada Television. For the first 26 years of its run, the series was broadcast on ITV in London and the north-west, and carried at different times in its history by certain other regional ITV stations; it was never networked nationally.

The first programme, on 5 November 1956, was presented by Brian Inglis, then deputy editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot;; the following week Kingsley Martin, editor of the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, presented the show. Martin presented the show on six occasions; Inglis became the most frequent presenter with about 170 programmes. Originally the programme ran for 25 minutes, which was later reduced to 20.

In 1969, the programme was briefly relaunched as &quot;The Papers&quot;, with sociologist Stuart Hall as the first presenter. This version of the programme lasted for only 10 weeks, after which it reverted to its original title, and took on the format it retained, with a different presenter (almost always a journalist) each week.

The show moved from ITV to Channel 4 when the latter was launched in 1982, but dropped the series on 2 September 1988. It returned to ITV, although during the night-time slot, less than a week later until December 1989. In March 1990 BBC2 commissioned the series from Granada in May 1990, broadcasting it on Friday evening before switching to Saturday afternoons. The programme&#x27;s running time was cut to 15 minutes, and later to 10. (&quot;What the Papers Say&quot; was the first ever Granada TV commission for the BBC, and had been the only surviving programme from the Manchester-based broadcaster&#x27;s inception in 1956).

The BBC decided in 2008 not to recommission the series, also dropping coverage of the annual &quot;What the Papers Say&quot; Awards. ITV Productions stated it hoped to find a &quot;new home&quot; for the show. In October 2008, the same format made a partial return to screens during Granada&#x27;s own regional political programme &quot;Party People&quot;, where it was usually introduced as &quot;a look at what the papers say&quot;. The programme was revived by BBC Radio 4 in April 2010.

On 17 February 2010, the BBC announced &quot;What the Papers Say&quot; would be revived on BBC Radio 4, with 12 editions being broadcast under the working title &quot;What the Election Papers Say&quot; in the run-up to the 2010 general election. The 12-part revival was regarded a success by former Radio 4 controller Mark Damazer, who commissioned the programme as a permanent addition to the station&#x27;s schedule at 22.45 on Sundays as the last segment of &quot;The Westminster Hour&quot;.

The radio programmes were recorded at the Westminster BBC&#x27;s New Broadcasting House studios. Presenters of the BBC Radio 4 programme included &quot;The Spectator&quot;&#x27;s editor Fraser Nelson, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;&#x27;s Kevin Maguire, &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Michael White, &quot;The Observer&quot;&#x27;s Andrew Rawnsley and John Kampfner.

== Critical acclaim ==
In its most recent incarnation, the programme received a warm reception from critics, including &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s Gillian Reynolds, who wrote, &quot;Three cheers for whoever thought of rescuing &quot;What the Papers Say&quot;. The old essay format, where the presenter writes a script linking illustrative extracts from the week&#x27;s press, still bursts with life. All the presenters so far have kept it sharp and spiky, the extract readers are full of gusto, production and editing are first-rate. It&#x27;s an espresso in a Horlicks world&quot;.

David Brockman wrote: &quot;What is universally accepted is that Granada&#x27;s What The Papers Say Awards, decided annually and first established in 1957, are among the most prestigious in the entire world of journalism&quot;.

== Music ==
The show&#x27;s theme music was originally &quot;The Procession of the Sardar&quot;, by Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov, a student of Rimsky-Korsakov. Later, it was replaced by &quot;Allegro Non Troppo&quot;, the first movement from Malcolm Arnold&#x27;s Second Set of &quot;English Dances&quot; Opus 33. The ten programmes titled &quot;The Papers&quot; used the Gershwin Piano Concerto in F as opening and closing music; when it reverted to the original title, it was replaced again by the Arnold work, which was also used for the revived programme on radio.

== Voices ==
In its original television format, actors reading the excerpts from the papers, out of vision, included Peter Wheeler (who narrated the introduction to Granada Television&#x27;s &quot;Crown Court&quot; series), Daphne Oxenford, Ray Moore and Barrie Hesketh.

The regular voices of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;What the Papers Say&quot; were:
* Frances Jeater, whose long and varied career has included performances with the Royal Shakespeare Company and National Theatre, as well as theatres across the UK and USA. Her television credits include roles in &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot;, &quot;Wycliffe&quot; and &quot;A Wing and A Prayer&quot;. She is a past member of the BBC Radio Drama Company.
* Steve Hodson, veteran stage and screen actor, who may be best known for his role as Steve Ross on the 1970s children&#x27;s television series &quot;Follyfoot&quot;. In addition to his vast stage and radio acting credentials, Hodson has recorded around 250 audio books.
* Rachel Atkins, who has worked extensively in theatre and television with credits ranging from &quot;EastEnders&quot; to BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Doctors&quot;. She has also been a member of the BBC Radio Drama Company. Atkins can currently be heard as the voice of Vicky Tucker on &quot;The Archers&quot;.
* Laurence Dobiesz made his radio debut in &quot;What the Papers Say&quot;. Having graduated from the Oxford School of Drama in 2008, Dobiesz has built up a portfolio of theatre credits including &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; with the Royal Shakespeare Company, &quot;Mad Forest&quot; and &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; at Southwark Playhouse.

<text>Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe, 530 U.S. 290 (2000), was a case heard before the United States Supreme Court. It ruled that a policy permitting student-led, student-initiated prayer at high school football games violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Oral arguments were heard March 29, 2000. The court announced its decision on June 19, holding the policy unconstitutional in a 6–3 decision.

==Background of the case==
Santa Fe Independent School District (SFISD) is a rural school district in Texas between the cities of Houston and Galveston. Two sets of students and their mothers — one a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the other Catholic —filed suit against the school district. The lawsuit alleged various violations of the Establishment Clause and asked for an injunction to prevent prayers from being offered at the graduation ceremony. In his decision, Judge Samuel B. Kent of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas ordered the school to eliminate all denominational activity in the classroom. Religion may only be discussed in a &quot;non-denominational and non-judgmental&quot; manner. He also permitted students to offer a non-denominational prayer at graduation ceremonies and football games. In allowing prayer at certain school functions, Judge Kent relied on &quot;Jones v. Clear Creek ISD&quot;, another school prayer case in a Houston area school district.

The school then adopted a policy in which the students would first vote by secret ballot whether to have a benediction at the graduation. If they voted yes, then they would elect students to deliver &quot;nonsectarian, nonproselytizing invocations and benedictions.&quot; The students voted in favor of school prayer, and two students delivered nonsectarian benedictions at the graduation ceremony. Following the ceremony, the school removed the requirement that the prayer be nonsectarian and non-proselytizing. A similar policy was adopted for football games.

===Fifth Circuit decision===
Both the SFISD and Doe appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The SFISD appealed because it claimed the words &quot;nonsectarian and non-proselytizing&quot; should not be necessary. The Does wanted prayer at school events to be found unconstitutional altogether.

In a 2–1 decision, Jacques L. Wiener, Jr., and Carl E. Stewart agreed with the District Court that &quot;the words &#x27;nonsectarian, non proselytizing&#x27; are constitutionally necessary components&quot; of a policy governing prayer at graduations. However, the Appeals Court struck down the part of the decision that permitted prayer at football games. Graduation was a once-in-a-lifetime event that deserved to be solemnized with prayer, while football games were &quot;far less solemn and extraordinary.&quot; E. Grady Jolly dissented, objecting that now &quot;the majority expressly exerts control over the content of its citizens&#x27; prayers.&quot;

The Supreme Court granted certiorari, limited to the following question: &quot;Whether petitioner&#x27;s policy permitting student-led, student-initiated prayer at football games violates the Establishment Clause.&quot;

==Opinion of the Court==

It held that these pre-game prayers delivered &quot;over the school’s public address system, by a speaker representing the student body, under the supervision of school faculty, and pursuant to a school policy that explicitly and implicitly encourages public prayer&quot; are not private, but public speech. &quot;Regardless of the listener&#x27;s support for, or objection to, the message, an objective Santa Fe High School student will unquestionably perceive the inevitable pregame prayer as stamped with her school&#x27;s seal of approval.&quot;

A dissenting opinion was written by Chief Justice Rehnquist, joined by Justices Scalia and Thomas. His dissent asserted that the majority opinion &quot;bristles with hostility to all things religious in public life&quot;. His material objections were, first that the policy on which the Court has now ruled had not yet been put into practice. &quot;[T]he question is not whether the district&#x27;s policy may be applied in violation of the Establishment Clause, but whether it inevitably will be.&quot; Second, Rehnquist also stated that the speech in question would be private, chosen and delivered by the speaker, rather than public, school-sponsored speech.

<text>Scenes from a Marriage () is a 1973 Swedish television miniseries written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. Over the course of six hour-long episodes, it explores the disintegration of the marriage between Marianne (Liv Ullmann), a divorce lawyer, and Johan (Erland Josephson), a reader in psychology. The series spans a period of 10 years. Bergman&#x27;s teleplay draws on his own experiences, including his relationship with Ullmann. It was shot on a small budget in Stockholm and Fårö in 1972.

After initially airing on Swedish TV in six parts, the miniseries was condensed into a theatrical version and received positive reviews in Sweden and internationally. &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot; was also the subject of controversy for its perceived influence on rising divorce rates in Europe. The film was ineligible for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but won the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film and several other honours. The miniseries and film version influenced filmmakers such as Woody Allen and Richard Linklater. It was followed by a sequel, &quot;Saraband&quot;, in 2003, and stage adaptations. It was also adapted into an HBO miniseries in 2021.

==Episodes==
The TV miniseries&#x27; six episodes ran between 11 April and 16 May 1973. At about 50 minutes per episode, the miniseries totals 282 minutes.

Scenes from each episode appear in the film version, which is 168 minutes long. The episode titles appear in the film version as chapter titles.

==Cast==
==Production==
Bergman wrote the teleplay for &quot;Scenes From a Marriage&quot; over three months. He drew on his personal experiences, including his relationship with Ullmann; his unhappy, eventually dissolved marriages to Käbi Laretei and Gun Hagberg; and the marriage of his parents, Karin and Erik Bergman. As a boy, he had witnessed his parents violently wrestling, with Karin slapping Erik and Erik pushing her against a wall. Ingmar also found his mother could be manipulative.

The budget for &quot;Scenes From a Marriage&quot; was approximately a third that of Bergman&#x27;s previous film, &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot;. Half was covered by Swedish Television and half by foreign companies. It was filmed in Stockholm and Fårö between July and October 1972. Cinematographer Sven Nykvist emphasized close-ups and employed small indoor film sets. Nykvist later regretted not using more tracking shots when he learned the miniseries would have a theatrical release. The filming schedule was one week per episode.

Ullmann compared performing in &quot;Scenes From a Marriage&quot; to appearing in a documentary, saying she &quot;felt very connected to the role.&quot; She said she was becoming more involved in the feminist movement while making the miniseries. Due to Ullmann and Erland Josephson&#x27;s comfort with their parts, the crew saved time by not having rehearsals.

==Release==
&quot;Scenes From a Marriage&quot; was broadcast as a miniseries in Sweden by SVT2 beginning on 11 April 1973. Polls indicated most of the viewers were women. A 169-minute theatrical version was screened in Sweden on 28 October 1974.

In the United States, a 167-minute version of the miniseries was released in cinemas, with the 16 mm film modified to 35 mm. It opened in New York City on 21 September 1974. The full miniseries was later aired in the U.S. by PBS in March and April 1977, and numerous times in 1979. The Criterion Collection released the miniseries and theatrical version on a three-disc DVD in Region 1 in 2004, complete with interviews and an essay by Phillip Lopate.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
In Sweden, &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot; received positive reviews for its dialogue and realism, with Mauritz Edstrom calling it &quot;one of Bergman&#x27;s finest human portrayals&quot;. Åke Janzon said that while the miniseries was not a masterpiece, it demonstrated psychological tension. Swedish director Maj Wechselmann criticized it on feminist grounds, saying it failed to criticize marriage roles. Bergman replied that the miniseries was meant to depict &quot;Marianne&#x27;s liberation&quot; and female &quot;suppressed aggressions&quot;. One controversy revolved around allegations that &quot;Scenes From a Marriage&quot; led to higher divorce rates in Sweden and around Europe by teaching couples to communicate their conflicts. Swedish divorce rates allegedly doubled one year after the miniseries was broadcast in 1973. In 2013 Rachel Halliburton disputed these allegations in &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine, remarking that sexual and women&#x27;s liberation were gaining prominence at the time and that the miniseries &quot;as such was as much a symptom of what was happening to modern marriage as a cause&quot;.

In the United States, Roger Ebert gave the theatrical version a full four stars, calling it &quot;one of the truest, most luminous love stories ever made&quot; and &quot;the best film of 1974&quot;. Vincent Canby, chief critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called the theatrical version &quot;a movie of such extraordinary intimacy that it has the effect of breaking into mysterious components many things we ordinarily accept without thought, familiar and banal objects, faces, attitudes, and emotions, especially love. [...] Ullmann again establishes herself as one of the most fascinating actresses of our time.&quot; Canby also wrote that &quot;Josephson gives an equally complex performance&quot; but found the character less admirable. Don Druker of &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; criticized the editing for the cinema, saying that the film &quot;shows its reassembled status rather badly&quot; and that &quot;moments of searing insight&quot; were provided mainly by Ullmann.

The film was included in &quot;&quot;The New York Times&quot; Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made&quot; in 2002. In 2004, essayist Phillip Lopate wrote that &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot; showed Bergman moving on from exploration of God&#x27;s silence to the subject of men, women, love and intimacy. Lopate found the film version &quot;more harrowing and theatrical,&quot; while the miniseries &quot;has the tendency to intersect with and form a more quotidian relationship to viewers’ lives; its characters become members of the family, and their resilience over time, regardless of the incessant crises thrown them by the script, induces a more good-humored, forgiving atmosphere.&quot; In 2007, Kristi McKim of &quot;Senses of Cinema&quot; wrote that the film &quot;stunningly exemplified&quot; the &quot;tension&quot; in &quot;the emotional causes and effects of feeling incompatible desires within the modern world.&quot; The film has a 88% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 24 reviews, and an average rating of 8.6/10. It was included on BBC&#x27;s 2018 list of the 100 greatest foreign-language films.

===Accolades===
The National Board of Review named &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot; one of the top foreign-language films of 1974. It sparked controversy when its ineligibility for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was questioned. The supposed reason was that it aired on television before it played in cinemas, but at the time that did not necessarily render a film ineligible. In this case, it was because the TV broadcast occurred the year before its theatrical debut in 1974. The film&#x27;s ineligibility prompted 24 filmmakers, including Frank Capra and Federico Fellini, to write an open letter demanding the rules for eligibility be revised.

==Legacy==
Bergman&#x27;s 1980 television film &quot;From the Life of the Marionettes&quot; centres on a couple named Peter and Katarina, loosely based on the supporting characters of those names in &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot;. Bergman also wrote the first stage adaptation of &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot; for the Residenztheater in Munich in 1981. &quot;Saraband&quot;, a quasi-sequel set decades after the original miniseries, aired on Swedish television in 2003. In 2008, a theatrical adaption by Joanna Murray-Smith was performed at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry, directed by Trevor Nunn and starring Imogen Stubbs and Iain Glen.

&quot;Knots Landing&quot; creator David Jacobs based the series on &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot;. Shashi Deshpande informally adapted it into the screenplay for Govind Nihalani&#x27;s &quot;Drishti&quot; in 1990. In 1991, Woody Allen costarred in Paul Mazursky&#x27;s &quot;Scenes from a Mall&quot;, a dark comedy about a deteriorating marriage. Allen&#x27;s similarly realist 1992 film &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; is also influenced by &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot;. Some critics compared Allen&#x27;s &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (1977) to &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot;.

In an April 2011 &quot;New York Times&quot; Opinionator article titled &quot;Too Much Relationship Vérité&quot;, Virginia Heffernan compares &quot;An American Family&quot; to &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot;: 

In June 2013, actor Ethan Hawke and director Richard Linklater said &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot; was the standard by which their &quot;Before Midnight&quot; must be judged. Russian director Andrey Zvyagintsev initially conceived &quot;Loveless&quot; (2017) as a remake of &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot;, with critics also comparing Zvyagintsev&#x27;s finished product to Bergman&#x27;s miniseries. Noah Baumbach&#x27;s &quot;Marriage Story&quot; (2019) also contains references to &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot;.

<text>PERM () is a stored-program-controlled electronic computer, built in Munich under the auspices of Hans Piloty and Robert Sauer 1952–1956. Some jokingly called it &quot;Pilotys erstes RechenMonster&quot; (&#x27;Piloty&#x27;s first calculating monster&#x27;). It weighed several tons.

The machine is now displayed in the informatics (computer science) exhibition of the Deutsches Museum München.

<text>H.245 is a control channel protocol used with[in] e.g. H.323 and H.324 communication sessions, and involves the line transmission of non-telephone signals. It also offers the possibility to be tunneled within H.225.0 call signaling messages. This eases firewall traversing.

H.245 is capable of conveying information needed for multimedia communication, such as encryption, flow control, jitter management, preference requests, as well as the opening and closing of logical channels used to carry media streams. It also defines separate &quot;send&quot; and &quot;receive&quot; capabilities and the means to send these details to other devices that support H.323.

==Handshake issues==
One major drawback within the initial version of H.323 was the lengthy, four-way H.245 protocol handshake required during the opening up of the logical channels of a telephony session. Later versions of H.323 introduced the &quot;Fast Connect&quot; procedure, using the fastStart element of an H.225.0 message. Fast Connect brought the negotiation down to a two-way handshake. Another recommendation, H.460.6, Extended Fast Connect Feature, exists that defines a one-way handshake.

<text>A multi-field dictionary is a specialized dictionary that has been designed and compiled to cover the terms within two or more subject fields. Multi-field dictionaries should be contrasted with single-field dictionaries and sub-field dictionaries. The typology consisting of these three dictionaries is important for a number of reasons. First of all, a multi-field dictionary is an example of the ordinary technical dictionary, covering numerous subject fields, e.g. banking, economics, finance, insurance and marketing.

The main problem with multi-field dictionaries is that they tend to cover one or two subjects extensively, whereas the vast majority of subject are only represented by a limited number of terms.

Secondly, the typical multi-field dictionary tends to be a minimizing dictionary, i.e. it covers only a limited number of terms within the subjects covered.

Thirdly, if the lexicographers intend to make a bilingual, maximizing multi-field dictionary they run into problems with the large amount of data that has to be included in the dictionary.

Consequently, the best coverage of linguistic and extra-linguistic aspects within the subject field covered by a dictionary will be found in a single-field dictionary.

<doc id="743173" wikidata="Q1434344" url="?curid=743173" title="Nepean Highway">
<text>Nepean Highway is a major highway in Victoria, running south from St Kilda Junction in inner-southern Melbourne to Portsea, tracing close to the eastern shore of Port Phillip for the majority of its length. It is the primary road route from central Melbourne through Melbourne&#x27;s southern suburbs. This name covers a few consecutive roads and is not widely known to most drivers except for its central section, as the entire allocation is still best known by the names of its constituent parts: [[St Kilda Road]], Brighton Road and Nepean Highway proper, and Point Nepean Road. This article will deal with the entire length of the corridor for sake of completion.

==Route==
===St Kilda Junction to Mornington===
Historically starting at the Melbourne CBD at Princes Bridge as St Kilda Road and heading south through the Melbourne Arts Precinct, today Nepean Highway is declared to commence at St Kilda Junction as St Kilda Road and heads in a southerly direction until it reaches the intersection with Carlisle Street (prior to the widening in the late 1960s this section was formerly known as High Street), where it changes name to Brighton Road and heads in a south-easterly direction until it reaches the intersection with Glen Huntly Road in Elsternwick, where it changes name again to become Nepean Highway proper. Tram route 67 runs down the middle of the highway until it turns into Glen Huntly Road. In 1984 conversion of the seven kilometre section between Cochrane Street, Elsternwick and South Road, Moorabbin to a dual carriageway was completed. At Glen Huntly Road, the speed limit increases to 80 km/h and the road widens to become an eight-lane dual carriageway. It is reduced to six lanes at Moorabbin, passing through Cheltenham and Mentone, and then to the 60 km/h or 70 km/h four-lane single carriageway after the roundabouts at Mordialloc. The highway then travels virtually along the foreshore of Port Phillip Bay to Frankston, with several stretches of dual carriageway, and then up Olivers Hill, from which there are good views across Frankston and the bay.

===Mornington Peninsula===
In the late 1960s a bypass road was constructed in the suburb of Mount Eliza. Previously the highway travelled through the main shopping village: this section is now known as Mount Eliza Way.

After passing through Mount Martha, the highway runs parallel to the Mornington Peninsula Freeway, before turning toward the town of Dromana. Here the highway changes name again, to become Point Nepean Road, its former name in the early years of settlement. From here, Arthurs Seat is accessible, which gives views across the bay, and on a clear day, the skyscrapers of Melbourne are visible. Anthonys Nose is a point, or escarpment located on the southern shore of Port Phillip Bay, between Dromana and McCrae. The highway passes between &quot;The Nose&quot; and the shores of the bay. It was named by Charles La Trobe in 1839. In the 1920s &quot;The Nose&quot; was modified in order to combat the daily tides that blocked the highway.

Route B110 leaves the highway at Sorrento to cross the bay to Queenscliff, via the ferry where it continues to Geelong, via Bellarine Highway, but the highway continues as a two lane road down to the seaside resort of Portsea. The end of the highway is the very nondescript painted turning circle, before the gates of the former Commonwealth quarantine and defence station of Point Nepean, a humble ending to Melbourne&#x27;s main southern highway.

==History==
Originally known as Arthurs Seat Road, it was built in the 1850s to provide a road (originally a crude sandy track) from the farms (owned by Jude Roberts) south of Melbourne and link the city with its southern bay settlements and sea defences at Point Nepean.

The passing of the &quot;Country Roads Act of 1912&quot; through the Parliament of Victoria provided for the establishment of the Country Roads Board (later VicRoads) and their ability to declare Main Roads, taking responsibility for the management, construction and care of the state&#x27;s major roads from local municipalities. Point Nepean Road was declared a Main Road on 1 December 1913, from Moorabbin through Mordialloc and Frankston to Mount Martha, and Dromana-Sorrento Road was declared a Main Road on 24 January 1916, from Dromana to Rye.

The passing of the &quot;Highways and Vehicles Act of 1924&quot; provided for the declaration of State Highways, roads two-thirds financed by the State government through the Country Roads Board. Nepean Highway was declared a State Highway in the 1947/48 financial year, from Glenhuntly Road in Elsternwick via Frankston to Portsea (for a total of 55 miles), subsuming the original declarations of Point Nepean Road and Dromana-Sorrento Roads as Main Roads. It was named after Point Nepean, itself named after the British politician and Colonial Administrator, Sir Evan Nepean, 1st Baronet PC.

The passing of the &quot;Transport Act of 1983&quot; updated the provision for the declaration of State Highways through VicRoads. The portion of Nepean Highway between Marine Drive in Dromana and the end of the road in Portsea was renamed back to Point Nepean Road and declared a Tourist Toad in May 1991; however the road was still known (and signposted) as Nepean Highway.

The passing of the &quot;Road Management Act 2004&quot; granted the responsibility of overall management and development of Victoria&#x27;s major arterial roads to VicRoads: in 2004, VicRoads re-declared the road as Nepean Highway (Arterial #6660), beginning at St Kilda Road at St Kilda (this declaration formally includes today&#x27;s St Kilda Road from St Kilda Junction and Brighton Road, but signposts along this section have kept its original name) and ending at Mornington-Flinders Road (sign-posted as Nepean Highway) in Dromana (better known as the Mount Martha interchange with Mornington Peninsula Freeway), and the renaming of Nepean Highway as Point Nepean Road (Arterial #4034) between Mornington-Dromana Road (known as Marine Drive) between Dromana and the end of the road in Portsea. The remnant between the intersection with Marine Parade and the Mount Martha interchange with the Mornington Peninsula Freeway have been declared as Bittern-Dromana Road (Arterial #5754) between Marine Parade and Bittern-Dromana Road proper, and Mornington-Flinders Road (Arterial #5751) between Mornington-Flinders Road proper and the Mount Martha interchange; these sections are still sign-posted as Nepean Highway.

Nepean Highway was signed as Metropolitan Route 3 between Melbourne and Portsea in 1965; with Victoria&#x27;s conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in the late 1990s, the southern half of the highway from Mornington to Sorrento was replaced by route B110, which continues on the other side of the bay at Queenscliff to run along Bellarine Highway until Geelong.

Between the 1950s and about 1980, the road was progressively upgraded to a divided highway between the City and Mordialloc. From Mordialloc to Frankston, the highway is an undivided four lane road. The widening of the Mordialloc Bridge, the last section of less than four lanes, was completed in early 2009.

===Possible future north–south connection===
Transurban, in their &quot;Response to the Eddington Report&quot;, July 2008, believe a north–south corridor from the Hume Freeway and Metropolitan Ring Road to the Nepean Highway south of Glen Huntly Road, Elsternwick, generally via the Hoddle Highway corridor, deserves attention.

This alignment would follow the original F2 Freeway corridor as proposed in the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan.

<text>A single-field dictionary is a specialized dictionary that has been designed and compiled to cover the terms of one particular subject field. Single-field dictionaries should be contrasted with multi-field dictionaries and sub-field dictionaries.

Examples of single-field dictionaries are a dictionary of law, a dictionary of economics and a dictionary of welding.

The main advantage of single-field dictionaries is that they can easily be maximizing dictionaries, i.e. attempt to cover as many terms of the subject field as possible without being a dictionary in several volumes.

<text>Rudolf IV (1 November 1339 – 27 July 1365), also called Rudolf the Founder (), was a scion of the House of Habsburg who ruled as duke of Austria (self-proclaimed archduke), Styria and Carinthia from 1358, as well as count of Tyrol from 1363 and as the first duke of Carniola from 1364 until his death. After the Habsburgs received nothing from the decree of the Golden Bull in 1356, he gave order to draw up the &quot;Privilegium Maius&quot;, a fake document to empower the Austrian rulers.

==Early life==
Born in Vienna, Rudolf was the eldest son of Duke Albert II of Austria and Joanna of Pfirt. One of the third generation of Habsburg dukes in Austria, he was the first to be born within the duchy. Therefore, he considered Austria his home, a sentiment that no doubt communicated itself to his subjects and contributed to his popularity. Faced with the Habsburgs&#x27; loss of the Imperial crown upon the assassination of his grandfather King Albert I of Germany in 1308, Rudolf was one of the most energetic and active rulers of Austria in the late Middle Ages, and it was said of him that as a young man he already had the air of a king.

== Rule ==

In 1357 he was married to Catherine of Bohemia, daughter of Emperor Charles IV. Eager to compete with his mighty father-in-law, who had made the Kingdom of Bohemia and its capital Prague a radiant center of Imperial culture, Rudolf desired to raise the importance of his residence Vienna to a comparable or greater height.
For more than a century, the Habsburg dukes had chafed at the popes&#x27; failure to make Vienna the seat of its own diocese, a status that they considered appropriate for the capital of a duchy. Instead the city parish was subordinate to the bishops of Passau, who had excellent connections to the pope, apparently dooming Vienna&#x27;s prospects in this regard. Rudolf, however, resorted to something which could be considered imposture: He initiated the creation of a &quot;metropolitan cathedral chapter&quot; at the church of St. Stephen (which, according to the name, should be assigned to a bishop), whose members wore red garments as cardinals do. The provost of the chapter received the title of an &quot;archchancellor of Austria&quot;.

Rudolf extended St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral, with the construction of its gothic nave being started under Rudolf&#x27;s rule. The construction efforts can be seen as an attempt to compete with St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague. Rudolf had himself and his wife depicted on a cenotaph at the cathedral&#x27;s entrance.

Similarly, by founding the University of Vienna in 1365, Rudolf sought to match Charles IV&#x27;s founding of the Charles University of Prague in 1348. Still known as &quot;Alma Mater Rudolphina&quot; today, the University of Vienna is the oldest continuously operating university in the German-speaking world. However, a faculty of theology, which was considered crucial for a university at that time, was not established until 1385, twenty years after Rudolf&#x27;s death.

To improve the economy of Vienna, Rudolf introduced many other measures, including the supervision by the mayor of sales of real property, instituted to prevent sales to the &quot;dead hand&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot;, to prevent economically unproductive ownership by the Church. Rudolf also managed to establish a relatively stable currency, the so-called &quot;Wiener Pfennig&quot; (Vienna Penny).

Rudolf is best known for another bluff, the forgery of the Privilegium Maius, which &quot;de facto&quot; put him on par with the seven Prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire, compensating for Austria&#x27;s failure to receive an electoral vote in the Golden Bull of 1356 issued by Emperor Charles IV. The title of Archduke (&quot;Erzherzog&quot;), invented by Rudolf, became an honorific title of all males of the House of Habsburg from the 16th century.

In 1363, Rudolf entered into a contract of inheritance with Countess Margaret of Gorizia-Tyrol upon the death of her only son, Meinhard III. The County of Tyrol came under Austrian rule after her death in 1369 since Margraret&#x27;s brother-in-law Duke Stephen II of Bavaria had invaded the country. In 1364, Rudolf declared the Carinthian March of Carniola a duchy and the next year established the town of Novo Mesto in the Windic March (in what would later be known as Lower Carniola, in present-day Slovenia), whose German name &quot;Rudolfswert&quot; was given in his honor. In the same time, he concluded another contract of inheritance with his father-in-law Emperor Charles IV, providing for mutual inheritance between the Habsburg and Luxembourg dynasties.

== Death ==
In spite of the high-flying and sometimes megalomaniac character of his plans, he managed to modernize his territories and his city, the prominence of which considerably increased. Rudolf died suddenly at Milan in 1365 aged 25. His and his wife&#x27;s remains are buried at the Ducal Crypt underneath the &quot;Stephansdom&quot; in Vienna.

His untimely death without issue halted further progress, however. His younger brothers Albert III and Leopold III, who were to rule jointly under the &quot;Rudolfinische Hausordnung&quot; (Rudolfinian House Rules), began to quarrel ceaselessly and ultimately agreed to divide the Habsburg territories between them according to the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg. It was Leopold&#x27;s descendant Frederick V of Austria, elected King of the Romans in 1440 and sole ruler over all Austrian lands from 1457, who reaped the fruit of Rudolf&#x27;s efforts and laid the foundations of the Habsburg monarchy.

<doc id="743205" wikidata="Q725012" url="?curid=743205" title="Michael Lou Martin">
<text>Michael Lou Martin (February 3, 1932 – May 27, 2015) was an American philosopher and former professor at Boston University. Martin specialized in the philosophy of religion, although he also worked on the philosophies of science, law, and social science. He served with the US Marine Corps in Korea.

== Biography ==

=== Life and academic career ===
Martin completed a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration in 1956 at Arizona State University. He was awarded an MA in philosophy at the University of Arizona in 1958 and in 1962 he was awarded a Ph.D. in philosophy from Harvard University. He was appointed assistant professor at University of Colorado in 1962 and in 1965 he moved to Boston University. He was appointed Professor of Philosophy Emeritus after a lifelong career at Boston University. Martin died on 27 May 2015, aged 83.

He is the author or editor of a number of books, including &quot;Atheism: A Philosophical Justification&quot; (1989), &quot;The Case Against Christianity&quot; (1991), &quot;Atheism, Morality, and Meaning&quot; (2002), &quot;The Impossibility of God&quot; (2003), &quot;The Improbability of God&quot; (2006), and &quot;The Cambridge Companion to Atheism&quot; (2006). He sat on the editorial board of the philosophy journal &quot;Philo&quot; and wrote many reviews and articles for journals and magazines including &quot;Free Inquiry&quot;.

===Atheism===
In his &quot;Atheism: A Philosophical Justification&quot;, Martin cites a general absence of an atheistic response to contemporary work in philosophy of religion, and accepts the responsibility of a rigorous defense of non belief as his &quot;cross to bear:&quot;

The aim of this book is not to make atheism a popular belief or even to overcome its invisibility. My object is not utopian. It is merely to provide good reasons for being an atheist. … My object is to show that atheism is a rational position and that belief in God is not. I am quite aware that atheistic beliefs are not always based on reason. My claim is that they should be.Martin used the concepts of negative and positive atheism as proposed by Antony Flew rather than the terms weak or soft atheism (negative) and strong or hard atheism (positive).

=== Debates ===
Martin took part in a number of written and internet debates with Christian philosophers.
* In 1991 Martin and Keith Parsons (founder of Georgia Skeptics and teacher of philosophy at Berry College (Rome, Georgia)) provided atheistic critiques to Douglas Jones&#x27; propositions on The Futility of Non Christian Thought in a written debate, &quot;Is Non-Christian Thought Justifiable?&quot;, originally published in &quot;Antithesis&quot; magazine.
*On November 26, 1994 Martin withdrew from a debate with Christian apologist Greg Bahnsen at Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee. The sponsor of the debate Marty Fields, the director of College Ministries at Second Presbyterian Church, explained to a school reporter that &quot;Martin refused to debate upon learning that Bahnsen would tape the event and sell copies through his Christian ministry. ...Martin was reluctant to participate in anything that would raise money for a religious organization.&quot; Bahnsen framed the withdraw as Martin lacking &quot;confidence in the public defense of atheism.&quot; And that &quot;sightings of Elvis are more common than sightings of my opponent.&quot; He set up an empty chair for Martin, and went on to record a lecture entitled the &quot;Debate that Never Was&quot;.
* He conducted a debate with John M. Frame over the internet in a series of articles and responses around Martin&#x27;s 1996 article, &quot;The Transcendental Argument for the Nonexistence of God&quot;.
* An internet debate with Christian philosopher Phil Fernandes in 1997 over the existence of God was published as a book in 2000 titled: &quot;Theism vs. Atheism: The Internet Debate&quot;.

<text>A sub-field dictionary is a specialized dictionary that has been designed and compiled to cover the terms of one (or possibly more) sub-fields of a particular subject field. It is therefore a sub-division of the class of dictionary called a single-field dictionary. Sub-field dictionaries should be contrasted with multi-field dictionaries and single-field dictionaries.

The typology consisting of these three dictionaries is important for a number of reasons. First of all a sub-field dictionary is an example of a very specialized dictionary in that it covers only a limited part of one single subject field. Examples of sub-field dictionaries are a dictionary of contract law (as opposed to the single-field dictionary of law) and a dictionary of fusion welding (as opposed to a dictionary of welding), or a dictionary of ethical philosophy (as opposed to a dictionary of philosophy).

The main advantage of sub-field dictionaries is that they can easily be maximizing dictionaries, i.e. deep rather than broad, attempting to cover as many terms of the sub-field as possible without expanding into several volumes. Consequently, sub-field dictionaries are ideal for extensive coverage of the linguistic and extra-linguistic aspects within a particular subject field.

Secondly, if the lexicographers intend to make a bilingual, maximizing sub-field dictionary they will not run into the same problems with the space available for presenting the large amount of data that has to be included in the dictionary, cf. a multi-field dictionary.

Consequently, the best coverage of linguistic and extra-linguistic aspects within the subject field covered by a dictionary will be found in a sub-field dictionary. The best coverage of a subject field will then be to compile a number of sub-field dictionaries that together cover the entire subject.

<doc id="743222" wikidata="Q122607" url="?curid=743222" title="Bow, London">
<text>Bow () is a district in East London, England and is in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It is an inner-city suburb located east of Charing Cross.

Historically in Middlesex, it became part of the County of London in 1888. &quot;Bow&quot; is an abbreviation of the medieval name Stratford-at-Bow, in which &quot;Bow&quot; refers to the bow-shaped bridge built here in the early 12th century. Bow contains parts of both Victoria Park and the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Old Ford and Fish Island are localities within Bow, but Bromley-by-Bow immediately to the south is a separate district. These distinctions have their roots in historic parish boundaries.

Bow underwent extensive urban regeneration including the replacement or improvement of council homes, with the impetus given by the staging of the 2012 Olympic Games at nearby Stratford.

==History==

Bow formed a part of the medieval parish of Stepney until becoming an independent parish in 1719. The parish vestry then undertook this responsibility until a rising population created the need for the Poplar Board of Works in 1855. This was superseded by the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar in 1900 until it was absorbed into the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in 1965. The council offices in Poplar High Street became Poplar Town Hall on the formation of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar in 1900.

===Bridges===
Stratforde was first recorded as a settlement in 1177, the name derived from its Old English meaning of &quot;paved way to a ford&quot;. The ford originally lay on a pre-Roman trackway at Old Ford about to the north, but when the Romans decided on Colchester as the initial capital for their occupation, the road was upgraded to run from the area of London Bridge, as one of the first paved Roman roads in Britain. The &#x27;paved way&#x27; is likely to refer to the presence of a stone causeway across the marshes, which formed a part of the crossing.

In 1110 Matilda, wife of Henry I, reputedly fell into the water at the ford on her way to Barking Abbey, and consequently ordered a distinctively bow-shaped, three-arched bridge to be built over the River Lea, &quot;The like of which had not been seen before&quot;. The area became known variously as &quot;Stradford of the Bow&quot;, &quot;Stratford of the Bow&quot;, &quot;Stratford the Bow&quot;, &quot;Stratforde the Bowe&quot;, and &quot;Stratford-atte-Bow&quot; (at the Bow) which over time was shortened to Bow to distinguish it from Stratford Langthorne on the Essex bank of the Lea. Land and Abbey Mill were given to Barking Abbey for maintenance of the bridge, who also maintained a chapel on the bridge dedicated to St Katherine, occupied until the 15th century by a hermit. This endowment was later administered by Stratford Langthorne Abbey. By 1549, this route had become known as &quot;The Kings Way&quot;, and later became known as the &quot;Great Essex Road&quot;.
Responsibility for maintenance of the bridge was always in dispute, no more so than with the Dissolution of the Monasteries, when local landowners who had taken over the Abbey lands were found responsible. The bridge was widened in 1741 and tolls were levied to defray the expense, but litigation over maintenance lasted until 1834, when the bridge needed to be rebuilt and landowners agreed to pay half of the cost, with Essex and Middlesex sharing the other. The bridge was again replaced in 1834, by the &quot;Middlesex and Essex Turnpike Trust&quot;, and in 1866 West Ham took responsibility for its upkeep and that of the causeway and smaller bridges that continued the route across the Lea.

In 1967 that bridge was replaced by a new modern bridge by the Greater London Council who also installed a two-lane flyover above it (designed by Andrei Tchernavin, son of Gulag escapee Vladimir V. Tchernavin) spanning the Blackwall Tunnel approach road, the traffic interchange, the River Lea and some of the Bow Back Rivers. This has since been expanded to a four-lane road.

===Church and parish===

Bow was an isolated hamlet by the early 14th century, some distance from its parish church of St Dunstan&#x27;s, Stepney. In 1311 permission was granted to build St Mary&#x27;s Church, Bow as a chapel of ease to allow the residents a more local and convenient place of worship. The land was granted by Edward III, on an &#x27;island site&#x27; surrounded by the King&#x27;s highway. 

Bow was made an Anglican parish of its own in 1719, with St Mary&#x27;s as its parish church. The new parish included the Old Ford area, which has also been known as North Bow.

===Historic literature and song===
There was a nearby Benedictine nunnery from the Norman era onwards, known as St Leonard&#x27;s Priory and immortalized in Chaucer&#x27;s description of the Nun Prioress in the General Prologue to his &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;. 

And Frenssh she spak ful faire and fetisly,
After the scole of Stratford atte Bowe,
For Frenssh of Parys was to hire unknowe.

The area was mentioned in the popular Tudor (or earlier) ballad, the Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green. In the ballad, the beautiful Bess, daughter of the blind beggar, leaves Bethnal Green to find a husband, follows the main road to Bow and then proceeds to Romford, where she finds many suitors.

===Goose fair===
Fairfield Road commemorates the Green Goose fair, held there on the Thursday after Pentecost. A &quot;Green Goose&quot; was a young or mid-summer goose, and a slang term for a cuckold or a &#x27;low&#x27; woman. In 1630, John Taylor, a poet, wrote &quot;At Bow, the Thursday after Pentecost, There is a fair of green geese ready rost, Where, as a goose is ever dog-cheap there, The sauce is over somewhat sharp and deare&quot;, taking advantage of the double entendre and continuing with other verses describing the drunken rowdy behaviour of the crowds. By the mid-19th century, the authorities had had enough and the fair was suppressed.

===Bow porcelain===
During the 17th century Bow and the Essex bank became a centre for the slaughter and butchery of cattle for the City market. Additionally the piggery which used the mash residue produced by the gin mills at Three Mills meant a ready supply of animal bones, and local entrepreneurs Thomas Frye and Edward Heylyn developed a means to mix this with clay and create a form of fine porcelain, said to rival the best from abroad, known as &quot;Bow Porcelain&quot;. In November 1753, in &quot;Aris&#x27;s Birmingham Gazette&quot;, the following advertisement appeared:
&quot;This is to give notice to all painters in the blue and white potting way and enamellers on chinaware, that by applying at the counting-house at the china-house near Bow, they may meet with employment and proper encouragement according to their merit; likewise painters brought up in the snuff-box way, japanning, fan-painting, &amp;c., may have an opportunity of trial, wherein if they succeed, they shall have due encouragement. N.B. At the same house, a person is wanted who can model small figures in clay neatly.&quot;

The &quot;Bow China Works&quot; prospered, employing some 300 artists and hands, until about 1770, when one of its founders died. By 1776 all of its moulds and implements were transferred to a manufacturer in Derby. In 1867, during drainage operations at the match factory of Bell &amp; Black at Bell Road, St. Leonard&#x27;s Street, the foundations of one of the kilns were , with a large quantity of &#x27;wasters&#x27; and fragments of broken pottery. The houses close by were then called China Row, but now lie beneath modern housing. Chemical analysis of the firing remains showed them to contain high quantities of bone-ash, pre-dating the claim of Josiah Spode to have invented the &quot;bone china&quot; process. More recent investigations of documentary and archaeological evidence suggests the concern was to the north of the High Street and across the river.

===19th century (pre-1837)===

Grove Hall Private Lunatic Asylum was established on the plot in 1820. This establishment primarily catered for ex-servicemen and was featured in Charles Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; (1839). It was replaced after it was shut and turned into Grove Hall Park was opened in 1909 following its purchase by the local authority in an auction in 1906. In 1878 it was the largest asylum in London with capacity for 443 inmates.

===Victorian period (1837 to 1901)===

In 1843 the engineer William Bridges Adams founded the Fairfield Locomotive Works, where he specialized in light engines, steam railcars (or railmotors) and inspection trolleys, including the Fairfield steam carriage for the Bristol and Exeter Railway and the &quot;Enfield&quot; for the Eastern Counties Railway. The business failed and the works closed , later becoming the factory of Bryant and May.
Bow was the headquarters of the North London Railway, which opened its locomotive and carriage workshops in 1853. There were two stations, Old Ford and Bow. During World War 2 the North London Railway branch from Dalston to Poplar through Bow was so badly damaged that it was abandoned.

Bow station opened in 1850 and was rebuilt in 1870 in a grand style, designed by Edwin Henry Horne and featuring a concert hall that was and . This became &quot;The Bow and Bromley Institute&quot;, then in 1887 the &quot;East London Technical College&quot; and a Salvation Army hall in 1911. From the 1930s it was used as the &quot;Embassy Billiard Hall&quot; and after the war became the &quot;Bow Palais&quot;, but was demolished in 1956 after a fire.

The London E postcode area was formed in 1866, with the E3 sub-division in 1917:

A statue of William Ewart Gladstone stands outside Bow Church. It was donated in 1882 by Theodore H. Bryant, part-owner of the Bryant and May match factory.

===Women&#x27;s rights, the matchgirls&#x27; strike, and Emmeline Pankhurst of the Suffragettes===

In 1888, the &quot;matchgirls&#x27; strike&quot; occurred at the Bryant and May match factory in Fairfield Road. This was a forerunner of the suffragette movement fight for women&#x27;s rights and also the trade union movement. The factory was rebuilt in 1911 and the brick entrance includes a depiction of Noah&#x27;s Ark and the word &#x27;Security&#x27; used as a trademark on the matchboxes. Match production ceased in 1979 and the building is now private apartments known as the Bow Quarter.

Emmeline Pankhurst began the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1903 with her daughters Christabel and Sylvia. Sylvia became increasingly disillusioned with the Suffragette movement&#x27;s inability to engage with the needs of working-class women like the match girls. Sylvia formed a breakaway movement, the East London Federation of Suffragettes, and based at 198 Bow Road, by the church, in a baker&#x27;s shop. This was emblazoned with &quot;Votes for Women&quot; in large gold letters and opened in October 1912. The local Member of Parliament, George Lansbury, resigned his seat to stand on a platform of women&#x27;s enfranchisement. Sylvia supported him and Bow Road became the campaign office, culminating in a huge rally in nearby Victoria Park, but Lansbury was narrowly defeated and support for the project in the East End was withdrawn.

Sylvia refocused her efforts from Bow, and with the outbreak of World War I began a nursery, clinic and cost price canteen for the poor at the bakery. A paper, the Women&#x27;s Dreadnought, was published to bring her campaign to a wider audience. At the close of war, the Representation of the People (Amendment) Act 1918 gave limited voting rights to property-owning women over the age of 30, and equal rights were finally achieved ten years later.

Pankhurst spent 12 years in Bow fighting for women&#x27;s rights. She risked constant arrest and spent a lot of time in Holloway Prison, often on hunger strike. She finally achieved her aim, and along the way had alleviated some of the poverty and misery and improved social conditions for all in the East End.

===20th century (1901 to 1999)===
Poplar Town Hall was built for the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar (which was formed from Poplar, Bow and Bromley-by Bow) in the mid-1930s at the corner of Bow Road and Fairfield Road; it is now used as commercial offices. It contains the &quot;Poplar Assembly Rooms&quot;, now no longer used. &quot;The Builders&quot;, by sculptor David Evans is a frieze on the face of the building, unveiled by George Lansbury, MP for Bow and Bromley, on 10 December 1938: the Portland Stone panels commemorate the trades constructing the Town Hall and symbolise the borough&#x27;s relationship with the River Thames and the youth of Poplar.

A memorial to Lansbury stands on the corner of Bow Road and Harley Grove, near 39 Bow Road which was his family home in the constituency until it was destroyed in the Blitz. It describes him as &quot;A great servant of the people&quot;. Lansbury was twice Mayor of Poplar and MP for Bromley and Bow. In 1921, he led the Poplar Rates Rebellion. His daughter-in-law, Minnie Lansbury, was one of the 30 Poplar councillors sent to prison, and died six weeks after leaving prison. A memorial clock to her is over a row of shops on Bow Road, near the junction with Alfred Street.

Ownership of Bow Road railway station passed from British Rail to the London Transport Executive in 1950.
The station building was placed as a Grade II listed building on 27 September 1973.

The Metropolitan Borough of Poplar was absorbed along with the boroughs of Stepney and Poplar into the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in 1965 as part of the newly formed Greater London.

Victoria Park became known for its open air music festivals, often linked with a political cause in the 1970/80s. In 1978, Rock Against Racism organised a protest event against growth of far-right organisations such as the National Front. The concert was played by The Clash, Steel Pulse, X-Ray Spex, The Ruts, Sham 69, Generation X, and the Tom Robinson Band.

In 1975, the Baroness Burdett Coutts Drinking Fountain was given Grade II* listed status by Historic England.

&quot;Bromley Public Hall&quot;, the old vestry hall for neighbouring Bromley-by-Bow (St Leonard&#x27;s Parish), can be seen on the south side of the Bow Road boundary, near the DLR station. It continues in use for registrations of births and marriages.

In 1986 the Greater London Council transferred responsibility for the park to the London borough of Tower Hamlets and the London Borough of Hackney, through a joint management board. Since 1994 Tower Hamlets has run the park alone.

Between 1986 and 1992 the name &quot;Bow&quot; applied to one of seven neighbourhoods to whom power was devolved from the council. This resulted in replacement of much of the street signage. Bow West and Bow East are two wards formed in 2002 that incorporate Old Ford and parts of Bethnal Green and Mile End. 

In 1991, St Paul&#x27;s, Old Ford was closed due to poor maintenance and safety concerns. This led to a successful campaign to raise more than £3,000,000 to renovate the church, so that it could continue to be used as a church, and also to better serve the local community.

Channel 4’s The Big Breakfast was broadcast live from a former lockkeeper&#x27;s cottages located on Fish Island, in Old Ford, from 28 September 1992 until 29 March 2002.

Rachel Whiteread&#x27;s temporary public sculpture &quot;House&quot; was created on Grove Road, being completed on 25 October 1993 and demolished eleven weeks later on 11 January 1994. The work won her the Turner Prize and K Foundation art award in November 1993.

Bow Arts was set up in 1994 by Marcel Baettig and Marc Schimmel, the owner of the then new premises. It became an artist studio supporting over 100 working artists. In 1995, the Trust became a registered arts and education charity. In 1996, after an Arts Council England grant, they were able to build the Nunnery Gallery on Bow Road.

===21st century (from 2000)===
An annual fête and music festival held on Wennington Green in Mile End Park initiated by the vicar of St Barnabas Bethnal Green and called the St Barnabas Community Fete (or Bowstock) ran from 2003 to 2010, with the 2007 fete being part of a case study in the &#x27;Community&#x27; section of the &quot;Living Britain&quot; report published by Zurich and The Future Laboratory.

In 2003, H. Forman and Son learned of London&#x27;s bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics. The company would have had to relocate from Stratford following a Compulsory Purchase Order. Then Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, officially opened the newly finished smokehouse in Old Ford in 2009. Following the compulsory purchase, the company rebuilt its premises near to the Olympic Park, on the banks of the River Lee.

In 2010 the National Lottery Big Lottery Fund awarded the London Borough of Tower Hamlets a £4.5 million grant towards a £12 million programme of major improvements to Victoria Park.
Fish Island has a long history as a home to artists and art spaces, having one of the highest densities of fine artists, designers and artisans in Europe according to a 2009 study which found around 600 artists&#x27; studios. In September 2014 Bow School moved from the old site off Fairfield Road to a new site in Bromley-by-Bow 1 mile to the south-east by Bow Locks, in a new building designed by van Heyningen and Haward Architects.

In 2014 local residents organized the first Roman Road Festival, a celebration of local life, business, and art. This grew to encompass dozens of events and hundreds of volunteers and led to the creation of the Roman Road Trust. In 2015, Roman Road was a top three finalist within the London category of for that year&#x27;s Great British High Street awards.

Cycle Superhighway 2 was upgraded between Bow and Aldgate and was completed in April 2016, with separated cycle tracks replacing cycle lanes along the majority of the route. A street party was held on Roman Road to mark the Queen Official Birthday on 11 June 2016, all profits from the stalls sales being shared with Bow Foodbank.

An orchard project was designed to celebrate the public green spaces in the Old Ford Estate in 2017, it was launched in response to feedback from local residents who wished to make better use of green space.

The Palm Tree pub building was Grade II listed in 2015 by Historic England.

As part of the Bow town centre scheme, it was announced in 2019 that money had been given to Tower Hamlets Council as part of GLA liveable neighbourhoods programme.

==Geography==
Bow has not been an administrative unit for nearly 100 years, and this makes definitions of the extent of the area difficult. There are two principal influences on perceptions of the extent of Bow: the historic hamlet which became an ancient parish, and the E3 postal area. The former common known as Bow Common lay far to the south of either of these defined areas, just beyond the southern boundary of the Bromley-by-Bow area.

===Ancient parish===
Bow was originally a hamlet of the Ancient Parish of Stepney; in this context, &quot;hamlet&quot; refers to a district, a sub-division of a parish with delegated responsibilities, rather than a small village. It is not clear when the Hamlet of Bow was established.

Bow became an independent parish when the pre-existing hamlet separated from Stepney in 1719, to become a late formed ancient parish, the area being a basis for both civil and ecclesiastical administration. The boundaries of the hamlet, which later became the parish, are the only formally defined boundaries the area has had.

The new parish took the Hamlet&#x27;s boundaries, in this way it inherited Stepney&#x27;s boundaries with Hackney to the north and the Stratford area of the parish of West Ham over the Lea to the east. The boundary with Bromley by Bow to the south ran along Bow Road, though it arced a little to the south near Bow Church and Bow Bridge. The western boundary, with what remained of Stepney ran in the vicinity of Coborn, Lyal and Driffield Roads, with further fission of the parish meaning the areas to the west become the independent parishes of Bethnal Green and Mile End Old Town.

The area was part of the historic (or ancient) county of Middlesex, but military and most (or all) civil county functions were managed more locally, by the Tower Division (also known as the Tower Hamlets).

The role of the &quot;Tower Division&quot; ended when Bow became part of the new County of London in 1889. The County of London was replaced by Greater London in 1965.

In 1900 Bow merged into the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, together with Poplar and Bromley-by-Bow. The new Borough preserved the identities of the constituent areas through the names and boundaries of its electoral wards. The Civil Parish of Bow continued to operate until the abolition of the Poor Law in 1930, though London&#x27;s Civil Parishes weren&#x27;t formally abolished until the creation of the modern London Boroughs in 1965.
The Metropolitan Boroughs of Poplar, Stepney and Bethnal Green united to form the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in 1965, meaning that Bow came to form the north-east part of the new borough.

===E3 postal area===
Bow is closely associated with the E3 postcode area, formed in 1917, but post code areas were never intended to define districts. E3 excludes parts of the Bow parish area north of the Hertford Union Canal and extends far to the south of Bow Road to include most of Bromley by Bow – as far south as the Limehouse Cut. It reaches as far west as the Regents Canal to take in parts of Bethnal Green and Mile End, and stretches over the Lea to take in Three Mills and the Twelvetrees Business Park in the old parish of West Ham.

==Governance and representation==

Bow is the north-east part of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.

For Planning Policy purposes, a Neighbourhood Plan is being prepared for an area referred to as &quot;Roman Road Bow&quot;. This area affected includes much of Bow and part of Mile End. The Neighbourhood Plan is intended to produce locally specific policies to complement the Tower Hamlets Local Plan.
Roman Road Bow Neighbourhood Plan has been initiated by Roman Road Trust, who are a community development organisation which is developing a community led vision for a flourishing high street and community in the area. The Steering Committee for the Roman Road Bow Neighbourhood Plan led the neighbourhood forum who currently meets every three weeks.

Since 2010 Rushanara Ali of the Labour Party is the local MP for the Bethnal Green and Bow constituency.

==Community==
The first Idea Store, a chain of educational community centres initiated by the Tower Hamlets Council, opened in Bow in 2002.

Roman Road Community Land Trust is an initiative that seeks to protect the diverse community by providing truly affordable housing and aims to create an alternative solution for residents who are being forced out of the area due to increased property prices.

Roman Road LDN is a hyperlocal magazine covering Bow as well as Old Ford and Globe Town and launched as a full-time publication in 2018. In 2019 the magazine had 2,500 subscribers, 10,000 followers on social media, and nearly 100,000 unique readers a year.

The Bow Arts Trust operates a Low Cost Accommodation scheme throughout the area. This provides housing for artists who have an interest in community work to have an affordable working space.

Ability Bow is a specialised gym for those with disabilities or long-term health conditions and offers one-to-one exercise sessions, it has specialist gym equipment with tailored fitness programmes for each member.

==Churches==
Bow Church (St Mary and Holy Trinity) is the historic parish church. It forms part of the Bow Group of Anglican churches, together with St Paul&#x27;s, Bow Common; All Hallows, Bow; St Paul&#x27;s, Old Ford and St Barnabas Bethnal Green. Other local churches include the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady and St Catherine of Siena, built in 1870, and Victoria Park Baptist Church, built 1872.

==Services==
A delivery office called the Bow Delivery Office is located in north Bow on Tredegar Road. with mail services provided by Royal Mail. Bow is in the Bow district but also recently partly in the Olympic Park district E20. Since the closure of the East London mail centre in 2012, all inward mail for the E postcode area is now sorted at Romford Mail Centre.

The Bow PDSA Pet Hospital is located on Malmesbury Road.

==Education==
St Agnes, Chisenhale Olga and Malmesbury primary schools are located in Bow, as is Central Foundation Girls School on Bow Road. Cherry Trees School is a specialist primary school located at Campbell Road in Bow.

==Transport==

===Rail===

Bow is connected to the London Underground at Bow Road tube station on the District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines and also the Docklands Light Railway Stratford-Canary Wharf line at Bow Church DLR Station.

===Buses===
London Buses routes 8, 25, 108, 205, 276, 309, 323, 425, 488, D8, N25 and N205 all operate within the area.

===Roads===

The A11 (Bow Road) passes east–west in south Bow, linking the area to Aldgate in the west and Stratford in the east. At Stratford, the road meets the A12 where eastbound traffic can continue towards Ilford, the M11 (for Stansted Airport) and destinations in Essex.

Bow is part of the council controlled parking zone and is covered by Zone B and includes all mini zones (B1/2/3) within the district boundaries. Additionally Saturday controls are enforced in north Bow.

=== Cycling ===
Bow is on London-wide and National and cycle networks. Public cycling infrastructure in the locale is provided by both Transport for London (TfL) and the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. Routes include:

* National Cycle Route 1 (NCR 1) - a long-distance leisure cycle route between Dover, Kent and the Shetland Islands, Scotland and forms part of the National Cycle Network. The route passes through Victoria Park and Mile End Park on traffic-free shared use paths. In North London, the route runs from Canary Wharf to Enfield Lock.
*Cycle Superhighway 2 (CS2) - a commuter cycling route from Aldgate in the City to Stratford in the east. The route runs signposted, unbroken and traffic-free on cycle track for the majority of the route. The route follows (Bow Road) through Bow, and the track is coloured blue. 
* Cycleway between Hackney and the Isle of Dogs - a proposed commuter cycle route made in 2019.

== Industry ==

=== Bow power station ===
Bow power station was a major 51.5 MW electricity generating station located in Marshgate Street, Bow. It was constructed by the Charing Cross and Strand Electricity Supply Corporation  which had obtained legal powers in 1899 to supply electricity to the City of London in competition with the City of London Electric Lighting Company. It was the first three-phase generating plant in the UK when it opened in 1902. The station transmitted electricity at 10,000 V through underground cables through the districts of Poplar, Mile End and Whitechapel to substations in the City and West End. A characteristic of the station were the 16 circular steel cooling towers, 30 ft (11 m) in diameter and 85 ft (26 m) high. Coal was delivered to the power station along the River Lea and its channels.

In 1925 Bow became part of the London Power Company (LPC). The LPC wished to consolidate electricity generation in a small number of high output station including Bow. The other stations were Deptford Power Station started in 1925 and completed in 1929 and Battersea A Power Station started in 1929 and completed in 1934. Bow power station was rebuilt and re-equipped several times. Upon nationalisation of the electricity industry in 1948 ownership of Bow power station was transferred to the British Electricity Authority (1948–55), and finally to the Central Electricity Generating Board (1958–69).

Bow power station closed in 1969 and was subsequently demolished.

<text>The Oxford Book of Modern Verse 1892–1935 is a poetry anthology edited by W. B. Yeats and published in 1936 by Oxford University Press. A long introductory essay starts from the proposition that the poets included should be all the &quot;good&quot; ones (implicitly the field is Anglo-Irish poetry, though notably a few Indian poets are there) active since the death of Tennyson. In fact, the selection of poets is idiosyncratic: late Victorians are strongly represented, while the war poets of the First World War are not. The modernist tendency does not predominate, though it is not ignored; Georgian poetry is covered quite thoroughly; and Oliver St. John Gogarty is given space and praised in the introduction as a great poet.

Yeats was influenced by his personal feelings, including poems by friends (e.g. Gogarty, Shri Purohit Swami), as well as Margot Ruddock, with whom he was having a relationship. He notes that Rudyard Kipling and Ezra Pound are under-represented because paying their royalties would have cost too much, though he did not say which of their poems he would have included.

<doc id="743227" wikidata="Q1432702" url="?curid=743227" title="Salgado Filho Porto Alegre International Airport">
<text>Porto Alegre–Salgado Filho International Airport is the airport serving Porto Alegre and the region of Greater Porto Alegre, Brazil. Since October 12, 1951, it is named after the Senator and first Minister of the Brazilian Air Force Joaquim Pedro Salgado Filho (1888–1950).

It is operated by Fraport Brasil.

==History==
Salgado Filho was originally called São João Federal Airport, after the neighborhood where it is located. In the beginning it was an air club, where the first flights landed on May 31, 1923.

In 1932, needing a facility for the fixed-gear aircraft which were replacing its seaplanes, Varig started using São João Airport as an operational base. However, it was only in 1940 that the first passenger terminal was commissioned.

On October 12, 1951, São João Federal Airport was renamed Salgado Filho Airport, after the Senator and Minister who died the year before in a crash involving a SAVAG aircraft that departed from Porto Alegre. On July 21, 1953, within a law prescribing rules for the naming of airports, the name of the facility was officially and exceptionally maintained as Salgado Filho Airport.

In 1953, the old terminal was incorporated into the maintenance facilities of Varig, a new passenger terminal was opened, and runways were paved. Until that year, larger aircraft such as Lockheed L-049 Constellations had to land at Canoas Air Force Base. This new terminal is known today as Passenger Terminal 2. It underwent major renovations and enlargements between 1969 and 1971; but unable to cope with the increasing traffic, another brand new facility was built. This new facility was named Passenger Terminal 1 and opened on September 11, 2001. Terminal 2 became underused by general aviation and cargo services.

However, in order to cope with the increasing passenger traffic at the airport, on September 8, 2010, a decision was made to renovate Terminal 2 and bring it back into passenger use. It became operational on December 4, 2010. This terminal 2 was again closed for air traffic on September 15, 2019, and it became the administration center of Fraport Brasil S.A.- Aeroporto de Porto Alegre.

Responding to critiques to the situation of its airports, on May 18, 2011, Infraero released a list evaluating some of its most important airports according to its saturation levels. According to the list, Porto Alegre was considered to be in good situation, operating with less than 70% of its capacity.

Previously operated by Infraero, in January 2018, the airport&#x27;s operations and administration were taken over by the German private airport operator Fraport, which in the previous year had been the winning bidder in an B3 (stock exchange) auction conducted by the Brazilian government for the concession of the airport for 25 years. Since the airport concession, Fraport has been expanding the runway from the current 2,280 meters (7,481 ft) to 3,200 meters (10,499 ft), allowing the landing of large aircraft and allowing the landing of flights from North America and Europe. It is expected that the expansion works will be concluded at the end of 2021.

The total area of the Salgado Filho Airport is about (940 acres) with of ramp area. Terminal 1 has and 16 gates with jetways. Terminal 2 has . In front of Terminal 1 there is a carpark with 1,440 places. Terminal 1 is the first facility in Latin America with a shopping mall.

One of the two TAP Maintenance &amp; Engineering centers in Brazil is located at Salgado Filho International Airport.

As of May 2022, the airport&#x27;s expanded 3,200 m (10,499 ft) runway has come into operation. With the runway expansion, larger aircraft such as the Boeing 747-400, Boeing 777-300 and Airbus 330-900 can operate at the airport, allowing direct flights to Europe and the United States.

===Closure Due to Flooding===

On May 3, 2024 due to catastrophic flooding affecting the State of Rio Grande do Sul and in particular to the flooding of the airport, all operations were suspended indefinitely. 

Operations to selected destinations resumed exceptionally at Canoas Air Force Base in the city of Canoas using a makeshift check-in facility at ParkShopping Canoas shopping mall. On July 15, 2024, all departure and arrival procedures restarted taking place at the Salgado Filho airport terminal, but with the passengers driven by bus directly to and from the Air Force Base apron. On this same day, the makeshift check-in facility was closed.

The full airport resumption of services was done in two phases: the first using a runway length of 1,730 m (5,676 ft) least affected by the flooding and restricted to 128 flights a day between 08:00 and 22:00. This first phase happened on October 21, 2024. The second phase, with full resumption of operations took place on December 16, 2024.

<text>Controlled foreign corporation (CFC) rules are features of an income tax system designed to limit artificial deferral of tax by using offshore low taxed entities. The rules are needed only with respect to income of an entity that is not currently taxed to the owners of the entity. Generally, certain classes of taxpayers must include in their income currently certain amounts earned by foreign entities they or related persons control.

A set of rules generally defines the types of owners and entities affected, the types of income or investments subject to current inclusion, exceptions to inclusion, and means of preventing double inclusion of the same income. Countries with CFC rules include the United States (since 1962), the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Russia (since 2015), Sweden, and many others. Rules in different countries may vary significantly.

==Motivations==
The tax law of many countries, including the United States, does normally not tax a shareholder of a corporation on the corporation&#x27;s income until the income is distributed as a dividend. Prior to the first U.S. CFC rules, it was common for publicly traded companies to form foreign subsidiaries in tax havens and shift &quot;portable&quot; income to those subsidiaries. Income shifted included investment income (interest and dividends) and passive income (rents and royalties), as well as sales and services income involving related parties (see transfer pricing). U.S. tax on this income was avoided until the tax haven country paid a dividend to the shareholding company. This dividend could be avoided indefinitely by loaning the earnings to the shareholder without actually declaring a dividend, because interest on the loans could be deducted and such interest payments would not be considered income. The CFC rules of Subpart F, and later of other countries&#x27; provisions, were intended to cause current taxation to the shareholder where income was of a sort that could be artificially shifted or was made available to the shareholder. At the same time, such rules were intended not to interfere with active business income or transactions with unrelated parties.

==Basic mechanisms==

The rules vary, so this paragraph may not exactly describe a particular tax system. However, the features listed are prevalent in most CFC systems. A domestic person who is a member of a foreign corporation (a CFC) that is controlled by domestic members must include in such person&#x27;s income the person&#x27;s share of the CFC&#x27;s subject income. The includible income (often determined net of expenses) generally includes income received by the CFC:

:* From investment or passive sources, including
:** Interest and dividends from unrelated parties,
:** Rents from unrelated parties, and
:** Royalties from unrelated parties;
:* From purchasing goods from related parties or selling goods to related parties where the goods are both produced and for use outside the CFC&#x27;s country;
:* From performing services outside the CFC&#x27;s country for related parties; 
:* From non-operating, insubstantial, or passive businesses, or
:* Of a similar nature through lower-tier partnerships and/or corporations.

In addition, many CFC rules treat as a deemed dividend earnings of the CFC loaned by the CFC to domestic related parties. Further, most CFC rules permit exclusion from taxable income of dividends paid by a CFC from earnings previously taxed to members under the CFC rules.

CFC rules may have a threshold for domestic ownership, below which a foreign entity is not considered a CFC. Alternatively or in addition, domestic members of a foreign entity owning less than a certain portion or class of shares may be excluded from the deemed income regime.

== Belgian law ==
The Belgian CFC legislation is incorporated in article 185/2 of the Belgian Income Tax Code. Belgium has chosen the transactional approach rather than the entity approach.

However, Belgian CFC legislation is obsolete in practice given that the application of Belgian transfer pricing rules (i.e. article 185, § 2 of the Belgian Income Tax Code, allowing the Belgian tax authorities to implement an upwards adjustment of the profits in case of a breach of the arm&#x27;s length principle) take precedence over CFC legislation.

==United States Subpart F rules==

Enacted in 1962, these rules incorporate most of the features of CFC rules used in other countries. Subpart F was designed to prevent U.S. citizens and resident individuals and corporations from artificially deferring otherwise taxable income through use of foreign entities. The rules require that:

* A &quot;U.S. Shareholder&quot;
* of a &quot;Controlled Foreign Corporation&quot; (&quot;CFC&quot;)

must include in their/its income currently

* Their/its share of Subpart F Income of the CFC (&quot;Subpart F income&quot;),
* Their/its share of aggregate income of 10% owned foreign corporations in excess of an aggregate return on depreciable tangible property of such 10% owned foreign corporations (&quot;§951A&quot;), and 
* Their/its share of earnings and profits (&quot;E&amp;P&quot;) of the CFC that are invested in &quot;United States Property&quot; (&quot;§956&quot;),

and further exclude from his/its income any dividends distributed from such previously taxed income.

Each of the italicized terms above is defined:

:* A &quot;Controlled Foreign Corporation&quot; is any corporation organized outside the U.S. (a foreign corporation) that is more than 50% owned by &quot;U.S. Shareholders&quot;.
:* A &quot;U.S. Shareholder&quot; is any U.S. person (individual or entity) that owns 10% or more of the foreign corporation. Complex rules apply to attribute ownership of one person to another person.
:* &quot;United States Property&quot; specifically includes obligations of or investments in related parties, tangible property with a physical situs in the U.S., and stock of a domestic corporation. It does not include bank deposits or obligations of unrelated persons.

Subpart F income includes the following:

:* Foreign personal holding company income (FPHCI), including dividends, interest, rents, royalties, and gains from alienation of property that produces or could produce such income. Exceptions apply for dividends and interest from related persons organized in the same country as the CFC, active rents and royalties, rents and royalties from related persons in the same country as the CFC, and certain other items.
:* Foreign base company sales income from buying goods from a related party and selling them to anyone or buying goods from anyone and selling them to a related party, where such goods are both made and for use outside the CFC&#x27;s country of incorporation. A branch rule may cause transfers between a manufacturing branch of a CFC in one country and a sales branch in another country to trigger Subpart F income.
:* Foreign base company services income from performing services for or on behalf of a related person. A substantial assistance rule can cause services performed for unrelated parties to be treated as performed for or on behalf of a related party.
:* Foreign base company oil-related income from oil activities outside the CFC&#x27;s country of incorporation.
:* Insurance income from insurance or annuity contracts related to risks outside the CFC&#x27;s country of incorporation.

but it does not include:

:* Items of income which (after considering deductions, etc., under U.S. concepts) were subject to foreign income tax in excess of 90% of the highest marginal U.S. tax rate for the type of shareholder;
:* &quot;De minimis&quot; amounts of Subpart F income in absence of other Subpart F income in the period;
:* Such income if the CFC has a deficit in E&amp;P, in which case it is deferred from recognition until the CFC has positive E&amp;P.
:* Any dividend received which is considered paid from amounts previously taxed under Subpart F.

In addition, after 2017 10% U.S. shareholders of CFCs must include in their income currently their share of aggregate return on depreciable tangible assets in excess of 10% for CFCs in which they are shareholders. Corporations that are U.S. shareholders get to deduct 50% of this inclusion.

Corporate U.S. shareholders are entitled to a foreign tax credit for their share of the foreign income taxes paid by a CFC with respect to E&amp;P underlying a Subpart F inclusion. Creditable taxes are reduced by 20% for §951A inclusions.

To prevent avoidance of Subpart F, U.S. shareholders of a CFC must recharacterize gain on disposition of the CFC shares as a dividend. In addition, various special rules apply.

==United Kingdom rules==
Controlled foreign company rules in the UK do not apply to individual shareholders, but otherwise they are similar to the U.S. rules. UK resident companies are subject to a charge for tax on undistributed income of low tax controlled foreign companies of which they are shareholders. Control for this purpose is not a mechanical test, rather one of factual control. However, control is considered to exist if the shareholder (or shareholder group of companies) owns 40% or more of voting interests.

A controlled company is a controlled foreign company if it is tax resident outside the UK and it is subject to a charge to tax less than it would have been were it a UK resident company. This is determined by comparing the actual charge to tax to a corresponding UK tax. In computing the corresponding tax, lower UK rates of tax on small companies are considered. Further, there are taken into account certain adjustments to income and fiscal years.

Certain exemptions apply. Generally, a foreign company will not be considered a controlled foreign company if it meets any of the following tests:
*It is tax resident in a &quot;white list&quot; of countries not considered to be tax havens, as maintained by HMRC . The list of exempt jurisdictions has 103 states and territories, including 20 of the 27 EU Member States. The 7 EU countries not on the list are Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia and Lithuania. Countries on the exempt list include Panama and Belize, which are on the EU&#x27;s list of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions. 
*The foreign company maintains a policy whereby it distributed 90% or more of its available earnings each year (no longer applicable since 1 July 2009),
*The company qualifies for a De Minimis level of accounting profits being less than £200,000. This level of income has been in place since 1 January 2011. Previously the level was set at £50,000 of profits that would be chargeable to UK corporation tax if the company were UK resident (not necessarily the same as accounting profits).
*The foreign company meets an active business test,
*The foreign company is publicly quoted on a recognized securities exchange, or
*The group meets a no-tax-reduction motive test.
*The CFC’s profits are taxable in the jurisdiction of its tax residency at a rate not less than 75 per cent of UK corporation tax. For example, if the current corporation tax rate in the UK is 19%, the CFC&#x27;s profits must be taxed at a rate not less than 14.25% in its jurisdiction in order to be exempt from taxation in the UK .

==German rules==
The CFC provisions in Germany (§§ 7-14 AStG, Foreign Tax Act) apply to both individual and corporate shareholders of a controlled foreign company. Such shareholders must include in their currently taxable income as a deemed dividend their share of passive income if two tests are met:
*German residents control the non-German corporation and
*That corporation is taxed at a rate of less than 25% on the passive income.

Control in this case is ownership by all German residents of more than 50% of the vote or capital of the foreign corporation. Such ownership includes both direct ownership and ownership through related persons. In determining the 50% threshold, all German residents are considered, even those owning very minor amounts.

Passive income is all income which is not active income, as extensively defined. Active income, however, excludes income where there has been substantial assistance by a German related party in earning the income. Active income also excludes all income of a foreign corporation lacking sufficient substance. Generally, passive income resembles U.S. foreign personal holding company income (discussed above). However, deemed dividends may be exempted under some treaties.

== India ==

The CFC Rules were first introduced in Indian taxation as part of the proposed Direct Tax Code 2010. The CFC provisions was also retained in revised draft of Direct Tax Code, 2013. However, Direct Tax Code is yet to become law in India and consequently, there are no statutory provisions in existing Income Tax Act (Income Tax Act 1961) for the enactment of CFC Rules.

==Other countries==
Japan taxes shareholders of foreign corporations where the operation of such corporation results in no or minimal foreign tax. However, there is a waiver where the foreign corporation conducts a substantial business.

New Zealand and Sweden each have CFC rules, following a &quot;grey list&quot; and a &quot;white list&quot; approach, respectively.

Australia has CFC rules similar to UK rules, but relies more on a &quot;white list&quot; of safe countries.

==Other anti-deferral measures==
Several countries have adopted other measures aimed at preventing artificial deferral of passive or investment income. U.S. passive foreign investment companies (PFICs) require that shareholders in foreign mutual funds must include in their current taxable income their share of ordinary income and capital gains, or face a tax-and-interest regime.

==Avoiding CFC status==
Under U.S. tax rules, a foreign entity may be classified for U.S. tax purposes as a corporation or a flow-through entity somewhat independently of its classification for foreign purposes. Under these &quot;check-the-box&quot; rules, shareholders may be able to elect to treat their shares income, deductions, and taxes of a foreign corporation as earned and paid by themselves. This permits U.S. individuals to obtain credits for foreign taxes paid by entities they own, which credits might otherwise not be available.

Artificial arrangements to avoid CFC status may be ignored in some jurisdictions under legislative provisions or court-developed law, such as substance over form doctrines.

European civil law may provide opportunities for formalistic agreements whereby practical control is maintained but formal definitions of control are not met.

<text>Étienne Marcel (between 1302 and 131031 July 1358) was provost of the merchants of Paris under King John II of France, called John the Good (Jean le Bon). He distinguished himself in the defence of the small craftsmen and guildsmen who made up most of the city population.

As a delegate of the Third Estate, he played an important role in the general assemblies held during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. In 1357, he found himself at the head of a reform movement that tried to institute a controlled French monarchy, confronting the royal power of the Dauphin or heir to the throne.

==Personal life==

Étienne Marcel was born into the wealthy Parisian bourgeoisie, the son of the clothier Simon Marcel and Isabelle Barbou. Like Jacob van Artevelde in Flanders, his upbringing in the urban upper class brought him close to the powerful; he grew up at a time when towns were becoming a political force, especially Paris, which was the largest city in western Europe (its population in about 1328 is estimated at 200,000 people).

Étienne Marcel first married Jeanne de Dammartin, and then Marguerite des Essars, who survived him.

==Political career==

Marcel is mentioned as provost of the in 1350. In 1354 he succeeded Jean de Pacy as provost of the Parisian merchants, representing the mercantile leaders of the Third Estate of the Estates General, at a time of great change; one of his earliest assemblies – that of 1355 – aimed at controlling the kingdom&#x27;s finances.

In 1356, King John was taken prisoner by the English after the Battle of Poitiers. On 17 October, his heir, the Dauphin Charles, called together the Estates General. In conjunction with Robert le Coq, Bishop of Laon, Marcel played a leading part; a committee of eighty members, formed by the two, pressed their demands for new taxes with such insistence that the Dauphin dismissed the body. Meanwhile, to protect the eastern approach to Paris, Marcel constructed a fortified gateway (the original Bastille).

Financial straits, not least dealing with the ransom for King John, obliged the Dauphin to summon them once more on 3 February 1357, with the consequence being the promulgation of a great edict of reform. John the Good forbade its being put into effect, whereupon a conflict ensued between Marcel and the Dauphin, Marcel endeavouring to set up Charles the Bad, King of Navarre, in opposition to John. The Estates General assembled again on 13 January 1358, and on 22 February the populace of Paris, led by Marcel, invaded the palace and murdered the marshals of Champagne Jean de Conflans, and of Normandy, Robert de Clermont, before the prince&#x27;s eyes.

The assemblies had proven incapable of resolving the crisis in the kingdom. The murder of the nobles undermined Marcel&#x27;s support from the aristocracy. The Dauphin, Charles, was now able to take power and save the crown for the Valois line.

Thenceforth, Marcel was openly hostile to the throne. After vainly hoping that the insurrection of the Jacquerie might turn to his advantage, he next supported the King of Navarre, whose armed bands infested the neighbourhood of Paris. On the night of 31 July, Marcel was about to open the gates of the capital to them, but Jean Maillart prevented the execution of this design. Marcel was assassinated by the guards at the Porte Saint-Antoine; the Parisian bourgeoisie believed he had gone too far in opposing the king, and thought he might hand over the city to the English. During the following days, his adherents were likewise put to death, and the Dauphin was able to re-enter Paris.

<doc id="743247" wikidata="Q7663057" url="?curid=743247" title="Syracuse Salty Dogs">
<text>The Syracuse Salty Dogs (formally Syracuse Football Club) were a professional men&#x27;s soccer team based in Syracuse, New York. The name of the club originates from &quot;Salty Dog&quot; which is nautical slang for an experienced sailor who has spent much of his life aboard a ship at sea and thus generally given increased credibility by ship mates in matters pertaining to ship-board life and duties. The club was a member of the USL A-League, playing only two seasons from 2003–2004. The club was owned and operated by the Syracuse Pro Sports Group and played most home games at P&amp;C Stadium. The team suspended operations in October 2004 due to financial difficulties and has not played since. However, groups have been working to return pro soccer to Syracuse.

==History==
The Salty Dogs debuted in their first season in 2003, where they ended with a record of 11–12–5 (W–L–D) under coach Laurie Calloway. The club improved their record to 15–8–5 in their second season and averaged the third highest attendance in the A-League during both years of play.

===Financial difficulties &amp; dissolution===
Despite high attendance in the A-League over both years of play and reasonable success on the field, the team faltered financially. The club&#x27;s budget had been strained as a result of using P&amp;C Stadium (now known as NBT Bank Stadium), which is run by the SkyChiefs. During their first season, the team was forced to play several home games at the Liverpool Athletic Complex at Liverpool High School, which was primarily a football field in Liverpool, NY (also shared by the CNY Express, an amateur American football team). During its second season, the team&#x27;s playoff home games were in Cortland, NY for similar reasons.

During the 2004 season, there were proposals to build a downtown soccer stadium near Armory Square. After the team&#x27;s folding, Matt Driscoll, Syracuse&#x27;s mayor, stated that realization of such a stadium is only feasible if a team returns. The Syracuse Pro Sports group filed for bankruptcy and folded the team in October 2004.

===Future soccer expansion in Syracuse===
The Syracuse-based Monolith Athletic Club had been working to return professional soccer to Syracuse. After over a year of negotiations, the group has cleared two out of the four hurdles necessary to bring USL soccer back to Syracuse. The second hurdle, seen as the pivotal one, involving the Chiefs baseball team, was cleared in April 2006. The final two steps involved a settlement on territorial rights with the Rochester Raging Rhinos and expansion approval from the USL.

In September 2007, Matt Michael of the Syracuse Post-Standard reported that Monolith Athletic Club owner, Vito William Lucchetti, was no longer involved with bringing pro soccer to Syracuse, citing his intent to focus on his other business dealings.

Professional soccer did return to Syracuse in 2011 when the expansion Syracuse Silver Knights began play in the Major Indoor Soccer League.

<text>Hluhluwe–Imfolozi Park, formerly Hluhluwe–Umfolozi Game Reserve, is the oldest proclaimed nature reserve in Africa. It consists of 960 km² (96,000 ha) of hilly topography north of Durban in central KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa and is known for its rich wildlife and conservation efforts. Operated by Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, the park is the only state-run park in KwaZulu-Natal where each of the big five game animals can be found.

Thanks to conservation efforts, the park now has one of the largest populations of white rhinoceros in the world, although this population remains severely threatened by the poaching of hundreds of rhinos every year in the park.

==History==

Throughout the park there are many signs of stone age settlements and iron smelting sites. The area is claimed to have been declared a royal hunting ground for the Zulu kingdom in the time of Shaka.

The southern white rhino, first identified by Western naturalist William John Burchell in 1812, was virtually eliminated during the 19th century by European hunters, and by 1895 was believed to be extinct. A population of between 20 and 100 was identified in South Africa and preserved by establishing the Umfolozi Junction Reserve and Hluhluwe Reserve, which are now parts of the Hluhluwe–Imfolozi Park.

Historically, tsetse flies carrying the nagana disease protected the area from colonial hunters. Later, as the Zululand area was settled by white farmers, wildlife in the reserves was blamed for the prevalence of the tsetse fly, and the reserves became experimental areas in the efforts to eradicate the fly. Farmers called for the slaughter of game and over 100,000 animals were killed in the reserves between 1919 and 1950, although the rhino population was spared. The introduction of DDT spraying in 1945 virtually eliminated the tsetse fly from the reserves, although subsequent outbreaks have occurred.

By the 1950s the white rhino population of the reserve had recovered to around 400, and the park&#x27;s warden, Ian Player, established Operation Rhino in the 1950s and 60s, with the park&#x27;s Rhino Capture Unit relocating hundreds of rhinos to establish populations in other reserves across their historic range.

In 1989, the corridor between the Hluhluwe and Imfolozi reserves was added in order to join the separate reserves into the current single park.

==Geography and climate==

The park is located in the province of KwaZulu-Natal on the east coast of South Africa. The park is closest to the town of Mtubatuba, Hluhluwe village and Hlabisa village. The geography of the area differs from the north, or Hluhluwe area, to the south, or Umfolozi area. Hluhluwe–Imfolozi Park is partly in a low-risk malaria area.

===Umfolozi===
This area is situated between the two Umfolozi Rivers where they divide into the Mfolozi emnyama (&#x27;Black Umfolozi&#x27;) to the north and the Mfolozi emhlophe (&#x27;White Umfolozi&#x27;) to the south. This area is to the south of the park and is generally hot in summer, and mild to cool in winter, although cold spells do occur.
The topography in the Umfolozi section ranges from the lowlands of the Umfolozi River beds to steep hilly country, which includes some wide and deep valleys. Habitats in this area are primarily grasslands, which extend into acacia savannah and woodlands.

===Hluhluwe===
The Hluhluwe region has hilly topography where altitudes range from above sea level. The high ridges support coastal scarp forests in a well-watered region with valley bushveld at lower levels. The north of the park is more rugged and mountainous with forests and grasslands and is known as the Hluhluwe area, while the Umfolozi area is found to the south near the Black and White Umfolozi rivers where there is open savanna.

==Biodiversity==
===Fauna===
The park is home to Africa&#x27;s big five game: African bush elephant, south-central black rhinoceros and southern white rhinoceros, African buffalo, lion and African leopard. It is home to 86 species including: Nile crocodile, hippopotamus, south African cheetah, spotted hyena, blue wildebeest, jackal, South African giraffe, Burchell&#x27;s zebra, waterbuck, nyala, common eland, greater kudu, impala, duiker, suni, reedbuck, common warthog, bushpig, mongoose, baboon, monkeys, a variety of tortoises, terrapins, snakes and lizards. It is one of the world&#x27;s top spots for viewing nyala. The park is a prime birding destination and is home to 340 bird species. The Hluhluwe River floodplain is one of the few areas in South Africa where yellow-throated longclaw, rosy-throated longclaw and Cape longclaw co-occur. Birdlife include black-crowned night heron,Wahlberg&#x27;s eagle, Shelley&#x27;s francolin, black-bellied bustard, Temminck&#x27;s courser, Klaas&#x27;s cuckoo, little bee-eater and crested barbet.

===Flora===
The park has a diverse floral community.

==Conservation efforts==
===Rhinoceros===

The park is the birthplace of rhino preservation, having been responsible for breeding the southern white rhinoceros back from near extinction in the first half of the 20th century. There are reportedly 1,600 white rhino in the reserve.

The rhino population remains severely threatened by poaching, with 222 rhinos poached in the province in 2017, most of them in the park. Hluhluwe–Imfolozi has implemented Smart Park which facilitates the integration of systems, including drone technology, for early detection and rapid response of reaction units. On 6 March 2020 two of three suspected rhino poachers were killed in a shootout after they were detected by infrared cameras. In 2022, 244 rhinos were poached in the province, 228 of them in the park. In 2023, the reserve was the worst hit in South Africa; The Minister of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries, Barbara Creecy, said &quot;We have to be concerned that almost every single day this year a rhino has been killed in Hluhluwe Imfolozi.&quot;

===African wild dog===
In 1981, the Natal Parks board (now Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife) attempted to reintroduce African wild dogs into the park. Twenty-three dogs were released in the reserve, most of which had been bred in zoos. However this met with limited success and by 2015, the population had fluctuated between 3 and 30 individuals. Further dogs were released into the park in 2022.

==Facilities==
The first visitor camp was built at Hilltop in 1934, and is now the main camp in the northern (Hluhluwe) section of the park. The main camp in the southern (Umfolozi) section is Mpila. The reserve has a road network.

==Impact of coal mining==

The park ecosystems are threatened by the proximity of coal mines, with ongoing applications for prospecting and mine expansions on the western and southern edges of the park.

<doc id="743257" wikidata="Q2432106" url="?curid=743257" title="Scaled Composites Tier One">
<text>Tier One was a Scaled Composites&#x27; 1990s–2004 program of suborbital human spaceflight using the reusable spacecraft SpaceShipOne and its launcher White Knight. The craft was designed by Burt Rutan, and the project was funded 20 million US Dollars by Paul Allen. In 2004 it made the first privately funded human spaceflight and won the 10 million US Dollars Ansari X Prize for the first non-governmental reusable crewed spacecraft.

The objective of the project was to develop technology for low-cost routine access to space. SpaceShipOne was not itself intended to carry paying passengers, but was envisioned that there would be commercial spinoffs, initially in space tourism. The company Mojave Aerospace Ventures was formed to manage commercial exploitation of the technology. A deal with Virgin Galactic could see routine space tourism in the late 2010s using a spacecraft based on Tier One technology. This led to Virgin Galactic&#x27;s SpaceShipTwo program, which has concluded in June 2024 with only a few flights with tourists having taken place starting in 2023.

==Design==

===Program components===
The design concept of Tier One was to air launch a three-person piloted spacecraft which climbs to slightly above altitude using a hybrid rocket motor and then glides to the ground and lands horizontally. Scaled Composites lists the following components of the program:


===Mission control===
In addition to an office-based mission control, Tier One has a mobile mission control center. This is relatively small, built into a large road-going truck. It bears the Scaled Composites logo, but no other overt indication of its link to Tier One. The vehicle performs a combination of support functions:
*telemetry monitoring and recording
*telecommunications
*auxiliary environment control for White Knight and SpaceShipOne

This control center is used to support both rocket motor ground tests and all flight tests of White Knight and SpaceShipOne. Its primary function is to monitor and record test data, and to this end it is equipped with computers and radio communication gear. SpaceShipOne&#x27;s avionics displays are duplicated in mission control. Telemetry data is received on a data reduction system (DRS), which automatically directs radio antennas to point at the craft being monitored. The telemetry system has a range of about .

The control center is equipped to communicate with Scaled Composites&#x27; offices, as well as the aircraft and spacecraft.

The control center maintains a temperature-controlled atmosphere for its staff, and can be hooked up to provide temperature control for the White Knight and SpaceShipOne cabins. The physical structure of mission control also provides easier access to the White Knight cabin.

===Nitrous oxide delivery===
Unlike the solid fuel, the nitrous oxide oxidiser is handled as a bulk commodity and pumped into the spacecraft&#x27;s oxidiser tank in the field. Tier One therefore has a mobile delivery system for nitrous oxide, which they call &quot;MONODS&quot; (mobile nitrous oxide delivery system).

The MONODS is built on an open trailer, which can be carried by road in conventional manner. It consists principally of a tank, a temperature control unit, and a generator to power the temperature control unit. The nitrous oxide is stored at room temperature, at a pressure of .

The MONODS is refilled from a commercial supplier, which uses tankers and delivers the nitrous oxide at about and . The MONODS heats the nitrous oxide to room temperature, increasing its pressure.

===Propulsion testing===
Tier One has a mobile thrust test stand, known as the &quot;test stand trailer&quot; (TST). The advantage of making it mobile is that all the mounting and instrumentation work can be done in the hangar, so that at the test site all that needs to be done is to fill the oxidiser tank (from the MONODS) and conduct the firing.

The test stand replicates the essential structural components of the spacecraft. It has an oxidiser tank and associated fittings identical to the one used in flight. This means that the motor test also automatically performs appropriate vibration, stress, and heat tests of the spacecraft structure. The crew cabin, however, is not replicated.

For ground-based thrust tests, a rocket nozzle with an expansion ratio of 10:1 is used, differing from the 25:1 nozzle used at altitude during actual flight.

The test stand is instrumented to record not only thrust but also side force and temperature and strain experienced by components. Data is recorded on a computer in a bunker at the test site. The data acquisition computer is remotely controlled from mission control.

===Flight simulator===
The SpaceShipOne flight simulator consists of a simulator program and a cockpit.

The flight simulator program aims to accurately simulate SpaceShipOne&#x27;s behaviour under any circumstances and in all phases of flight. Rather than having a model of SpaceShipOne&#x27;s overall flight behaviour, it uses computational fluid dynamics to model the air around the craft. It calculates the aerodynamic and other forces operating on the craft, taking into account the positions of its control surfaces. This simulation is based on the computer modelling that was used during the design process and refined using data from flight tests. This yields a highly accurate image of craft behaviour, even in unanticipated modes of flight. (This is one of the first modern aircraft to be designed without wind tunnel testing.)

The cockpit replica is on a static base, and so cannot accurately reproduce the equilibrioceptive and accelerative aspects of flight. However, White Knight is equipped to operate as a high-fidelity moving-base simulator. The simulator cockpit is an accurate copy of the SpaceShipOne cabin, including its avionics. It is the system of pilot plus avionics, not just the pilot, that is being simulated to. The flight simulator program drives the sensor inputs that are used by the avionics, and also drives twelve display computers which use commercial graphics software to generate high-resolution images of the outside view for the pilot. These views appear on eleven monitors and one projector screen. Stick force feedback is not simulated in real time.

Ground-based flight simulation is not only used for pilot training. It is also used to train ground crew, develop procedures, and test the avionics software and hardware.

==History and status==
According to Scaled Composites, the concept for the program originated in April 1996, preliminary development began in 1999, and full development began in April 2001. It was initially kept secret, even after White Knight first flew on August 1, 2002. The program was announced to the public on April 18, 2003, when the program was ready to flight-test SpaceShipOne. Its first flight test, SpaceShipOne flight 01C, took place on May 20, 2003.

After months of glide tests, the first powered flight, SpaceShipOne flight 11P, was made on December 17, 2003. Further powered tests followed, reaching increasing altitudes, culminating on June 21, 2004 with the first privately funded human spaceflight, SpaceShipOne flight 15P. Ansari X Prize competitive flights followed. SpaceShipOne flight 16P on September 29, 2004 and SpaceShipOne flight 17P on October 4, 2004 were successful competitive flights, winning the X Prize.
The Tier One program run by Scaled Composites concluded after the retirement of SpaceShipOne, transitioning to a successor program for customer Virgin Galactic.

==Funding==

The costs of development, construction, and operation of Tier One, although not publicly released, are estimated to be in the range of 20 million to 30 million US dollars, roughly two to three times the value of the Ansari X Prize award. The sole sponsor, initially secret, was revealed to be Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft and the 48th richest person in the world. The revelation, on December 17, 2003, the same day as the program&#x27;s first powered flight test, followed speculation that Allen was involved.

Some commentators have drawn comparisons between the relative inexpense of the Tier One program and the high cost of the Space Shuttle program, though the technological difficulties of the two programs are completely different. SpaceShipOne, because it flies suborbitally, does not need to reach the high speeds of the Space Shuttle (Mach 3 vs. Mach 25), nor the same altitude ( suborbital vs. orbit). SpaceShipOne also does not carry the same crew (3 members vs. 7) or payload (negligible vs. 25 tons), and makes much shorter flights (a few minutes vs. several days). The SpaceShipOne program is a technical achievement more on a par with the X-15 than the Shuttle.

Inflation adjusted comparisons of the SpaceShipOne program with that of the X-15 budget, indicate that the Tier One program cost 1/100 that of the X-15 program, although the three X-15 aircraft made almost 200 test flights in their entire test program, typically exploring hypersonic flight between mach 4-7. Only a few dozen X-15 flights specifically sought to reach peak altitudes rather than achieve top speeds, though only two flights ever reached altitudes near those achieved by SpaceShipOne. On the other hand, the Tier One project also paid for construction of the White Knight mothership within its budget, while NASA had nearly free use of a pre-existing USAF B-52 bomber modified to perform drop tests of experimental aircraft of many kinds (currently in use for PegasusXL launches).

==Publicity==
Tier One was initially developed secretly, as is Scaled Composites&#x27; policy with new programs. On April 18, 2003 the program was publicly announced, and SpaceShipOne and White Knight were demonstrated to the media at a rollout attended by between 550 and 600 people. Media interest was so intense that what had been intended as a Family and Friends Day on April 24, 2003 was turned into a second media day.

Scaled Composites again courted publicity by announcing in advance the final test flight, SpaceShipOne flight 15P, intended to be the program&#x27;s first spaceflight. About 11,000 people went to Mojave Spaceport to watch the flight, which was also televised. The flight was run as an airshow, with both the principal craft and the chase planes making takeoffs and landings in front of the crowd, and celebratory flybys when the test succeeded. The flight was not only a technical success but also a popular success, stimulating intense public interest in spaceflight.

==Future==
During an interview in the documentary Black Sky: The Race For Space, Rutan stated that Tier One will cover suborbital flights, Tier Two will cover orbital flights, and Tier Three will cover flights beyond Earth&#x27;s orbit (including flights to the moon and other planets). In the same documentary he displayed designs for an orbital craft based on SpaceShipOne, which had a rocket roughly twice SpaceShipOne&#x27;s length mounted to the ship&#x27;s rear.

==Commercial aspects==

The stated objective of the Tier One program is to demonstrate suborbital human spaceflight operations at low cost. Before Burt Rutan began considering this project, there were three major barriers to the goal of affordable suborbital spaceflight:
*the dangers and costs of liquid propulsion fuels (they explode);
*the uncontrollable nature of solid fuel rocket motors (can not be turned off);
*the difficulties in getting back without burning up in the atmosphere.

Tier One itself is not intended to carry paying passengers, and US Government permits would be required if it did intend to do so. It is a technology testbed, and it is expressly intended that the technology developed in the program will later be used in commercial spaceflights. To that end, Allen and Rutan created a company, Mojave Aerospace Ventures, which owns the project&#x27;s intellectual property and manages all commercial exploitation of it.

Scaled Composites initially expressed a hope that by about 2013 it would be possible for members of the public to experience a suborbital flight for about the price of a luxury cruise. On September 25, 2004, a deal was struck with Virgin Galactic to develop the Virgin SpaceShip based on a scaled-up version of SpaceShipOne. These spacecraft are to be built by The Spaceship Company.

<doc id="743265" wikidata="Q33509" url="?curid=743265" title="Ingush language">
<text>Ingush (; , , pronounced ) is a Northeast Caucasian language spoken by about 350,000 people, known as the Ingush, across a region covering the Russian republics of Ingushetia, Chechnya, North Ossetia, as well as the countries Turkey, Kazakhstan, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, et al.

==Classification==
Ingush and Chechen, together with Bats, constitute the Nakh branch of the Northeast Caucasian language family. There is pervasive passive bilingualism between Ingush and Chechen.

==Dialects==
Ingush is not divided into dialects with the exception of (native name: Галай-Чӏож/Галайн-Чӏаж), which is considered to be transitional between Chechen and Ingush.

==Geographic distribution==
Ingush is spoken by about 350,000-400,000 people (2020) in Russia, primarily in the North Caucasian republics of Ingushetia, North Ossetia and Chechnya. Speakers can also be found in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Belgium, Norway, Turkey and Jordan.

===Official status===
Ingush is, alongside Russian, an official language of Ingushetia, a federal subject of Russia.

==Phonology==
=== Vowels ===

The diphthongs are иэ /ie/, уо /uo/, оа , ий /ij/, эи /ei/, ои /oi/, уи /ui/, ов /ow/, ув /uw/.

=== Consonants ===

The consonants of Ingush are as follows, including the Latin orthography developed by Johanna Nichols:

Single consonants can be geminated by various morphophonemic processes.

==Writing system==

It is possible that during the period of 8–12th century, when the Temples like Tkhaba-Yerdy emerged in Ingushetia, a writing system based on a Georgian script emerged. This is attested by the fact that a non-Georgian name, &#x27;Enola&#x27;, was found written on the arc of Tkhaba-Yerdy. Furthermore, Georgian text was found on archaeological items in Ingushetia that could not be deciphered.

Ingush became a written language with an Arabic-based writing system at the beginning of the 20th century. After the October Revolution it first used a Latin alphabet, which was later replaced by Cyrillic.
==Grammar==
Ingush is a nominative–accusative language in its syntax, though it has ergative morphology.

===Case===
The most recent and in-depth analysis of the language shows eight cases: absolutive, ergative, genitive, dative, allative, instrumental, lative and comparative.


===Tenses===
===Numerals===
Like many Northeast Caucasian languages, Ingush uses a vigesimal system, where numbers lower than twenty are counted as in a base-ten system, but higher decads are base-twenty.

# Note that &quot;four&quot; and its derivatives begin with noun-class marker. &quot;d-&quot; is merely the default value.

===Pronouns===
===Word order===
In Ingush, &quot;for main clauses, other than episode-initial and other all-new ones, verb-second order is most common. The verb, or the finite part of a compound verb or analytic tense form (i.e. the light verb or the auxiliary), follows the first word or phrase in the clause&quot;.

<text>John Caspar Dreier (December 27, 1906 – March 10, 1994) was an American diplomat and teacher.

He served as United States Ambassador to the Organization of American States (OAS) between 1951 and 1960. He then taught for a number of years at the School of Advanced International Studies (part of Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C.). 

== Biography ==
Born in Brooklyn, New York City, Dreier attended Harvard College. He began working for the Department of State in 1941. In this role, he witnessed the Bogotazo riots in Bogotá, Colombia in 1948. Appointed to be Ambassador to the OAS by President Harry S. Truman, he served from January 2, 1951 until November 12, 1960. Dreier primarily saw the OAS as a way to limit the spread of communism in Latin America during the Cold War, with his tenure including events such as the 1954 Guatemalan coup d&#x27;état and the Cuban Revolution. Furthermore, he believed that the OAS needed to address social and economic concerns in order to succeed.

Dreier retired in 1972. After retirement, he played an active role as a teacher and trustee of the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine, and was involved in conservation projects. Two annual scholarships exist at the College in honor of him and his wife.

=== Personal life ===
Dreier was married to Louisa Cabot Richardson Dreier for 51 years and had three children. He died in Cambridge, Massachusetts of complications resulting from congestive heart failure.

<text>The Zaporozhian Cossacks, also known as the Zaporozhian Cossack Army or the Zaporozhian Host (), were Cossacks who lived beyond (that is, downstream from) the Dnieper Rapids. Along with Registered Cossacks and Sloboda Cossacks, Zaporozhian Cossacks played an important role in the history of Ukraine and the ethnogenesis of Ukrainians.

The Zaporozhian Sich grew rapidly in the 15th century from serfs fleeing the more controlled parts of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. It became established as a well-respected political entity with a parliamentary system of government. During the course of the 16th, 17th and well into the 18th century, the Zaporozhian Cossacks were a strong political and military force that challenged the authority of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Tsardom of Russia, and the Crimean Khanate.

The host went through a series of conflicts and alliances involving the three powers, including supporting an uprising in the 18th century. Their leader signed a treaty with the Russians. This group was forcibly disbanded in the late 18th century by the Russian Empire, with much of the population relocated to the Kuban region on the south edge of the Russian Empire, while others founded cities in southern Ukraine and eventually became state peasants. The Cossacks served a valuable role of conquering the Caucasian tribes and in return enjoyed considerable freedom granted by the Tsars.

The name comes from the location of their fortress, the Sich, in &quot;land beyond the rapids&quot;, from Ukrainian &quot;beyond&quot; and &quot;rapids&quot;.

==Origins==

It is not clear when the first Cossack communities on the Lower Dnieper began to form. There are signs and stories of similar people living in the Eurasian Steppe as early as the 12th century. At that time they were not called Cossacks, since &quot;cossack&quot; is a word that also in Turkic language means a &quot;free man&quot; which shares its etymology with the ethnic name &quot;Kazakh&quot;. It later became a Ukrainian and Russian word for &quot;freebooter.&quot; The steppes to the north of the Black Sea were inhabited by nomadic tribes such as the Cumans, Pechenegs and Khazars. The role of these tribes in the ethnogenesis of the Cossacks is disputed, although later Cossack sources claimed a Slavicised Khazar ancestry.

There were also groups of people who fled into these wild steppes from the cultivated lands of Kievan Rus&#x27; in order to escape oppression or criminal pursuit. Their lifestyle largely resembled that of the people now called Cossacks. They survived chiefly from hunting and fishing and raiding Asiatic tribes for horses and food, but they also mixed with these nomads as well adopting a lot of their cultural traits. In the 16th century, a great organizer, Dmytro Vyshnevetsky, a Ukrainian noble, united these different groups into a strong military organization.

The Zaporozhian Cossacks had various social and ethnic origins but were predominantly made up of escaped serfs who preferred the dangerous freedom of the wild steppes, rather than life under the rule of Polish aristocrats. However, townspeople, lesser noblemen and even Crimean Tatars also became part of the Cossack host. They had to accept Eastern Orthodoxy as their religion and adopt its rituals and prayers.

The nomadic hypothesis was that the Cossacks came from one or more nomadic peoples who at different times lived in the territory of the Northern Black Sea. According to this hypothesis the Cossacks&#x27; ancestors were the Scythians, Sarmatians, Khazars, Polovtsy (Cumans), Circassians (Adygs), Tatars, and others. The nomadic hypothesis of the origin of the Cossacks was formed under the influence of the Polish historical school of the 16th-17th centuries and was connected with the theory of the Sarmatian origin of the gentry. According to the tradition of deriving the origin of the state or people from a certain people of antiquity, the Cossack chroniclers of the 18th century advocated the Khazar origin of the Cossacks. In the 20th century, the Russian scientist Gumilyov was an apologist for the Polovtsian origin of the Cossacks.

==Within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth==

In the 16th century, with the dominance of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth extending south, the Zaporozhian Cossacks were mostly, if tentatively, regarded by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as their subjects. Registered Cossacks were a part of the Commonwealth army until 1699.

Around the end of the 16th century, relations between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire, which were not cordial to begin with, were further strained by increasing Cossack aggression. From the second part of the 16th century, the Cossacks started raiding Ottoman territories. The Polish government could not control the fiercely independent Cossacks but, since they were nominally subjects of the Commonwealth, it was held responsible for raids by their victims. Reciprocally, the Tatars living under the Ottoman rule launched raids in the Commonwealth, mostly in the sparsely inhabited south-east territories of Ukraine. Cossacks, however, were raiding wealthy merchant port cities in the heart of the Ottoman Empire, which were just two days away by boat from the mouth of the Dnieper River.

By 1615 and 1625, Cossacks had managed to raze townships on the outskirts of Constantinople, forcing the Ottoman Sultan Murad IV to flee his palace. His nephew, Sultan Mehmed IV, fared little better as the recipient of the legendary Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, a ribald response to Mehmed&#x27;s insistence that the Cossacks submit to his authority. Consecutive treaties between the Ottoman Empire and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth called for both parties to keep the Cossacks and Tatars in check, but enforcement was almost non-existent on both sides. In internal agreements, forced by the Poles, the Cossacks agreed to burn their boats and stop raiding. However, boats could be rebuilt quickly, and the Cossack lifestyle glorified raids and looting.

During this time, the Habsburg monarchy sometimes covertly employed Cossack raiders to ease Ottoman pressure on their own borders. Many Cossacks and Tatars shared an animosity towards each other due to the damage done by raids from both sides. Cossack raids followed by Tatar retaliation, or Tatar raids followed by Cossack retaliation, were an almost regular occurrence. The ensuing chaos and string of conflicts often turned the entire south-eastern Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth border into a low-intensity war zone and led to an escalation of Commonwealth–Ottoman warfare, from the Moldavian Magnate Wars to the Battle of Cecora (1620) and wars in 1633–34.

Cossack numbers expanded, with Ukrainian peasants running from serfdom in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Attempts by the szlachta to turn the Zaporozhian Cossacks into serfs eroded the Cossacks&#x27; once fairly strong loyalty towards the Commonwealth. Cossack ambitions to be recognised as equal to the szlachta were constantly rebuffed, and plans for transforming the Polish–Lithuanian Two-Nations Commonwealth into a Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth (with the Ukrainian Cossack people) made little progress, owing to the Cossacks&#x27; unpopularity. The Cossacks&#x27; strong historic allegiance to the Eastern Orthodox Church put them at odds with the Catholic-dominated Commonwealth. Tensions increased when Commonwealth policies turned from relative tolerance to the suppression of the Orthodox church, making the Cossacks strongly anti-Catholic, which at that time was synonymous with anti-Polish.

The waning loyalty of the Cossacks and the szlachta&#x27;s arrogance towards them resulted in several Cossack uprisings against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the early 17th century. Finally, the King&#x27;s adamant refusal to bow to the Cossacks&#x27; demand to expand the Cossack Registry was the last straw that prompted the largest and most successful of these: the Khmelnytsky Uprising, which started in 1648. The uprising became one of a series of catastrophic events known as the Deluge, which greatly weakened the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and set the stage for its disintegration one hundred years later. Even though Poland probably had the best cavalry in Europe, their infantry was weak. Since Poland recruited most of its infantry from Ukraine, once this became free from Polish rule, the army of the Commonwealth suffered greatly.

==Organization==
The Zaporozhian Host as a military-political establishment developed based upon unique traditions and customs called the Cossack Code, which was formed mostly among the cossacks of Zaporozhian Host over decades. The host had its own military and territorially administrative division: 38 kurins (sotnia) and five to eight &quot;palanka&quot;s (territorial districts) as well as an original system of administration with three levels: military leaders, military officials, leaders of march and palankas. All officership (military starshyna) was elected by the General Military Council for a year on January 1. Based on the same customs and traditions the rights and duties of officers were explicitly codified. The Zaporozhian Host developed an original judicial system, at the base of which lay the customary Cossack Code. The norms of the code were affirmed by those social relations that have developed among cossacks. Some sources refer to the Zaporozhian Sich as a &quot;cossack republic&quot;, as the highest power in it belonged to the assembly of all its members, and because its leaders (&quot;starshina&quot;) were elected.

Officially the leader of Zaporozhian Host never carried the title of hetman, while all leaders of cossacks formations were unofficially referred to as one. The highest body of administration in the Zaporozhian Host was the &quot;Sich Rada&quot; (council). The council was the highest legislative, administrative, and judicial body of the Zaporozhian Host. Decisions of the council were considered the opinion of the whole host and obligated to its execution each member of the cossack comradeship. At Sich Rada were reviewed issues of internal and foreign policies, conducted elections of military &quot;starshina&quot;, division of assigned land, punishment of criminals who committed the worst crimes etc.

The Zaporozhian Host, while being closely associated with the Cossack Hetmanate, had its own administration and orders. For military operations, cossacks of the host organized into &quot;Kish&quot;. Kish is an old term for a reinforced camp that was used in the 11th-16th centuries and later adopted by cossacks. Kish was the central body of government in Sich under jurisdiction of which were administrative, military, financial, legal, and other affairs. Kish was elected on annual bases at the Sich Rada (Black Rada). Black Rada was a council of all cossacks. Kish election were taken place either on 1 January, 1 October (Intercession of the Theotokos holiday - Pokrova), or on the 2nd-3rd day of Easter.

There was a cossack military court, which severely punished violence and stealing among compatriots, bringing women to the Sich, consumption of alcohol in periods of conflict, etc. There were also churches and schools, providing religious services and basic education. Principally, the Eastern Orthodox Church was preferred and was a part of the national identity.

In times of peace, Cossacks were engaged in their occupations, living with their families, studying strategy, languages and educating recruits. As opposed to other armies, Cossacks were free to choose their preferred weapon. Wealthy Cossacks preferred to wear heavy armour, while infantrymen preferred to wear simple clothes, although they also occasionally wore mail.

At that time, the Cossacks were one of the finest military organizations in Europe, and were employed by Russian, Polish, and French empires.

Beside the above-mentioned kurins there also was a great number of other kurins outside the Host.

===Cossack Regalia (&quot;Kleinody&quot;)===
The most important items of the host were the Cossack &quot;Kleinody&quot; (always in plural; related to Imperial Regalia) that consisted of valuable military distinctions, regalia, and attributes of the Ukrainian Cossacks and were used until the 19th century. Kleinody were awarded to Zaporozhian Cossacks by the Polish king Stephen Báthory on 20 August 1576 to Bohdan Ruzhynsky, among which were khoruhva, bunchuk, bulawa &quot;mace&quot; and a seal with a coat of arms on which was depicted a cossack with a &quot;samopal&quot; &quot;rifle&quot;. The kleinody were assigned to hetman&#x27;s assistants for safekeeping, thus there have appeared such ranks as &quot;chorąży&quot; (&quot;flag-bearer&quot;), &quot;bunchuzhny&quot; (&quot;staff-keeper&quot;), etc. Later part of Cossack kleinody became pernaches, timpani (&quot;lytavry&quot;), kurin banners (badges), batons, and others.

The highest symbol of power was the &quot;bulawa&quot; or mace carried by hetmans and kish-otamans. For example, Bohdan Khmelnytsky already from 1648 carried a silver gold-covered bulawa decorated with pearls and other valuable gem stones. The cossack colonels had pernachs (&quot;shestoper&quot;s) - smaller ribbed bulawas which were carried behind a belt.

The seal of the Zaporozhian Host was produced in a round form out of silver with a depiction of cossack in a gabled cap on a head, in kaftan with buttons on a chest, with a sabre (&quot;shablya&quot;), powder flask on a side, and a self-made rifle (&quot;samopal&quot;) on the left shoulder. Around the seal was an inscription «Печать славного Війська Запорізького Низового» (&quot;Seal of the glorious Zaporozhian Host&quot;). Palanka&#x27;s and kurin&#x27;s seals were either round or rectangular with images of lions, deers, horses, moon, stars, crowns, lances, sabers, and bows.

Khoruhva was mostly of a crimson color embroidered with coats of arms, saints, crosses, and others. It was always carried in front of the army next to the hetman or otaman. A badge (&quot;znachok&quot;) was a name for a kurin&#x27;s or company&#x27;s (sotnia) banners. There was a tradition when the newly elected colonel was required at his own expense prepare palanka&#x27;s banner. One of the banners was preserved until 1845 in Kuban and was made out of tissue in two colors: yellow and blue. Kettledrums (lytavry) were large copper boilers that were fitted with a leather which served for transmission of various signals (calling cossacks to a council, raising an alarm etc.).

Each item of kleinody was granted to a clearly assigned member of cossack &quot;starshina&quot; (officership). For example, in the Zaporozhian Host, the bulawa was given to the otaman; the khoruhva - to the whole host although carried by a khorunzhy; the bunchuk also was given to otaman, but carried by a bunchuzhny or bunchuk comrade; the seal was preserved by a military judge, while the seals of the kurin - to the kurin otaman, and the seals of the palanka - to the colonel of a certain palanka; the kettledrums were in possession of a dovbysh (drummer); the staffs - to a military osavul; the badges were given to all the 38 kurins in possession to the assigned badge comrades. All kleinody items (except for the kettledrum sticks) were stored in the Sich&#x27;s Pokrova church treasury and were taken out only on a special order of kish otaman. The kettledrum sticks were kept in the kurin with the assigned dovbysh. Sometimes, part of kleidony was considered a great silver inkwell (&quot;kalamar&quot;), an attribute of a military scribe (&quot;pysar&quot;) of the Zaporozhian Host. Similar kleinods had the officership of the Cossack Hetmanate, cossacks of Kuban, Danube, and other cossack societies.

Upon the destruction of the Sich and liquidation of Ukrainian Cossacks the kleinody were gathered and given away for storage in Hermitage and Transfiguration Cathedral in Saint Petersburg, Kremlin Armoury in Moscow as well as other places of storage. By the end of 19th century the Hermitage stored 17 kurin banners and one khoruhva, the Transfiguration Cathedral contained 20 kurin banners, three bunchuks, one silver bulawa, and one silver gold-covered baton. Today the fate of those national treasures of Ukrainian people is unknown. After the February Revolution in 1917 the Russian Provisional Government adopted the decisions of returning them to Ukraine, however, due to the events of the October Revolution of the same year the decision was not executed. With the proclamation of independence, the Ukrainian government has raised the issue of returning the national cultural valuables before the leadership of Russia; no specific agreements have ever been reached, however.

==Alliance with Russia==
After the Treaty of Pereyaslav in 1654, the Zaporozhian Host became a suzerainty under the protection of the tsar of Russia, although for a considerable period of time it enjoyed nearly complete autonomy. After the death of Bohdan Khmelnytsky in 1657, his successor Ivan Vyhovsky initiated a turn towards Poland, alarmed by the growing Russian interference in the affairs of the Hetmanate. An attempt was made to return to the three-constituent Commonwealth of nations with the Zaporozhian cossacks joining the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth by signing the Treaty of Hadiach (1658). The treaty was ratified by the Sejm but was rejected at the Hermanivka Rada by the Cossack rank and file, who would not accept a union with Catholic Poland, which they perceived as an oppressor of Orthodox Christianity. The angered cossacks executed &quot;Polkovniks&quot; Prokip Vereshchaka and Stepan Sulyma, Vyhovsky&#x27;s associates at the Sejm, and Vyhovsky himself narrowly escaped death.

The Zaporozhians maintained a largely separate government from the Hetmanate. The Zaporozhians elected their own leaders, known as Kish otaman, for one-year terms. In this period, friction between the cossacks of the Hetmanate and the Zaporozhians escalated.

The Cossacks had fought in the past for independence from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and they were later involved in several uprisings against the tsar, in fear of losing their privileges and autonomy. In 1709, for example, the Zaporozhian Host led by Kost Hordiienko joined Hetman Ivan Mazepa against Russia. Mazepa was previously a trusted adviser and close friend to Tsar Peter the Great but allied himself with Charles XII of Sweden against Peter I. After the defeat at the Battle of Poltava Peter ordered a retaliatory destruction of the Sich.

With the death of Mazepa in Bessarabia in 1709, his council elected his former general chancellor, Pylyp Orlyk, as his successor. Orlyk issued the project of the Constitution, where he promised to limit the authority of the Hetman, preserve the privileged position of the Zaporozhians, take measures towards achieving social equality among them, and steps towards the separation of the Zaporizhian Host from the Russian State—should he manage to obtain power in the Cossack Hetmanate. With the support of Charles XII, Orlyk made an alliance with the Crimean Tatars and Ottomans against Russia, but following the early successes of their 1711 attack on Russia, their campaign was defeated, and Orlyk returned into exile. The Zaporozhians built a new Sich under Ottoman protection, the Oleshky Sich on the lower Dnieper.

Although some of the Zaporozhian cossacks returned to Moscow&#x27;s protection, their popular leader Kost Hordiienko was resolute in his anti-Russian attitude and no rapprochement was possible until his death in 1733.

==Within the Russian Empire==
Over the years the friction between the Cossacks and the Russian tsarist government lessened, and privileges were traded for a reduction in Cossack autonomy. The Ukrainian Cossacks who did not side with Mazepa elected as Hetman Ivan Skoropadsky, one of the &quot;anti-Mazepist&quot; polkovniks. While advocating for the preservation for the Hetmanate autonomy and privileges of the starshina, Skoropadsky was careful to avoid open confrontation and remained loyal to the union with Russia. To accommodate Russian military needs, Skoropadsky allowed for stationing of ten Russian regiments in the territory of the Hetmanate. At the same time, Cossacks took part in construction, fortification and channel development projects in Saint Petersburg, as part of the effort by Peter the Great to establish the new Russian capital. Many did not return, and it is often stated that St. Peterburg &quot;was built on bones&quot;.

In 1734, as Russia was preparing for a new war against the Ottoman Empire, an agreement was made between Russia and the Zaporozhian cossacks, the Treaty of Lubny. The Zaporozhian Cossacks regained all of their former lands, privileges, laws and customs in exchange for serving under the command of a Russian Army stationed in Kiev. A new &quot;sich&quot; (&quot;Nova Sich&quot;) was built to replace the one that had been destroyed by Peter the Great. Concerned about the possibility of Russian interference in Zaporozhia&#x27;s internal affairs, the Cossacks began to settle their lands with Ukrainian peasants fleeing serfdom in Poland and Russia proper. By 1762, 33,700 Cossacks and over 150,000 peasants populated Zaporozhia.

By the late 18th century, much of the Cossack officer class in Ukraine was incorporated into the Russian nobility, but many of the rank and file Cossacks, including a substantial portion of the old Zaporozhians, were reduced to peasant status. They were able to maintain their freedom and continued to provide refuge for those fleeing serfdom in Russia and Poland, including followers of the Russian Cossack Yemelyan Pugachev, which aroused the anger of Russian Empress Catherine II. As a result, by 1775 the number of runaway serfs from the Hetmanate and Polish-ruled Ukraine to Zaporizhiya rose to 100,000.

The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca (1774) annexed the Crimean Khanate into Russia, so the need for further southern frontier defence (which the Zaporozhians carried out) no longer existed. Colonisation of Novorossiya began; one of the colonies, located just next to the lands of the Zaporozhian Sich, was New Serbia. This escalated conflicts over land ownership with the Cossacks, which often turned violent.

==The end of the Zaporozhian Host (1775)==
The decision to disband the Sich was adopted at the court council of Catherine the Great on 7 May 1775. General Peter Tekeli received orders to occupy and liquidate the main Zaporozhian fortress, the Sich. The plan was kept secret and regiments returning from the Russo-Turkish war, in which Cossacks also participated, were mobilized for the operation. They included 31 regiments (65,000 men in total). The attack took place on 15 May and continued until 8 June. The order was given by Grigory Potemkin, who had formally become an honorary Zaporozhian Cossack under the name of Hrytsko Nechesa a few years prior. Potemkin was given a direct order from Empress Catherine II, which she explained in her Decree of 8 August 1775:

On 5 June 1775 General Tekeli&#x27;s forces divided into five detachments and surrounded the Sich with artillery and infantry. The lack of southern borders and enemies in the past years had a profound effect on the combat-ability of the Cossacks, who realised the Russian infantry would destroy them after they were surrounded. To trick the Cossacks, a rumour was spread that the army was crossing Cossack lands en route to guard the borders. The surprise encirclement was a devastating blow to the morale of the Cossacks.

Petro Kalnyshevsky was given two hours to decide on the Empress&#x27;s ultimatum. Under the guidance of a &quot;starshyna&quot; Lyakh, behind Kalnyshevky&#x27;s back a conspiracy was formed with a group of 50 Cossacks to go fishing in the river Inhul next to the Southern Bug in Ottoman provinces. The pretext was enough to allow the Russians to let the Cossacks out of the siege, who were joined by five thousand others. The fleeing Cossacks traveled to the Danube Delta, where they formed the new Danubian Sich, under the protectorate of the Ottoman Empire.

When Tekeli became aware of the escape, there was little left to do for the remaining 12,000 Cossacks. The Sich was razed to the ground. The Cossacks were disarmed in a mostly bloodless operation, while their treasury and archives were confiscated. Kalnyshevsky was arrested and exiled to the Solovki, where he lived in confinement to 112 years of age. Most upper level Cossack Council members, such as Pavlo Holovaty and Ivan Hloba, were repressed and exiled as well, although lower level commanders and rank and file Cossacks were allowed to join the Russian hussar and dragoon regiments.

==Aftermath==
The destruction of the Sich created difficulties for the Russian Empire. Supporting the increase in the privileges gained by the higher ranking leadership put a strain in the budget, whilst the stricter regulations of the regular Russian Army prevented many other Cossacks from integrating. The existence of the Danubian Sich, which would support the Ottoman Empire in the next war, was also troublesome for the Russians. In 1784 Potemkin formed the &quot;Host of the Loyal Zaporozhians&quot; (Войско верных Запорожцев) and settled them between the Southern Bug and Dniester rivers. For their invaluable service during the Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792), they were rewarded with the Kuban land and migrated there in 1792.

In 1828, the Danubian Sich ceased to exist after it was pardoned by Emperor Nicholas I, and under amnesty its members settled on the shores of the Northern Azov between Berdyansk and Mariupol, forming the Azov Cossack Host. Finally in 1862 they too migrated to the Kuban and merged with the Kuban Cossacks. The Kuban Cossacks served Russia&#x27;s interests right up to the October Revolution, and their descendants are now undergoing active regeneration both culturally and militarily. The 30,000 descendants of those Cossacks who refused to return to Russia in 1828 still live in the Danube delta region of Ukraine and Romania, where they pursue the traditional Cossack lifestyle of hunting and fishing and are known as &quot;Rusnaks&quot;.

==Legacy==
Although in 1775 the Zaporozhian Host formally ceased to exist, it left a profound cultural, political and military legacy on Ukraine, Russia, Poland, Turkey and other states that came in contact with it. The shifting alliances of the Cossacks have generated controversy, especially during the 20th century. For Russians, the Treaty of Pereyaslav gave the Tsardom of Russia and later Russian Empire the impulse to take over the Ruthenian lands, claim rights as the sole successor of the Kievan Rus&#x27;, and for the Russian Tsar to be declared the protector of all Russias, culminating in the Pan-Slavism movement of the 19th century.

Today, most of the Kuban Cossacks, modern descendants of the Zaporozhians, remain loyal towards Russia. Many fought in the local conflicts following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and today, just like before the revolution when they made up the private guard of the Emperor, the majority of the Kremlin Presidential Regiment is made up of Kuban Cossacks.

For the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Khmelnytsky Uprising and the fall of the Zaporozhian Cossacks effectively marked the beginning of its end with the Deluge, which led to the gradual demise of the Commonwealth ending with the Partitions of Poland in the late 18th century. A similar fate awaited both the Crimean Khanate and the Ottoman Empire; having endured numerous raids and attacks from them both, the Zaporozhian Cossacks aided the Russian Army in ending Turkey&#x27;s ambitions of expanding into northern and Central Europe, and like Poland, after the loss of Crimea, the Ottoman Empire began to decline.

The historical legacy of the Zaporozhian Cossacks shaped and influenced the idea of Ukrainian nationalism in the latter half of the 19th century. Ukrainian historians, such as Adrian Kashchenko (1858–1921), Olena Apanovich and others suggest that the final abolishment of the Zaporozhian Sich in 1775 was the demise of a historic Ukrainian stronghold. After the Revolution of 1917, corps of Free Cossacks were organized in Ukraine to defend the newly proclaimed Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. During the Soviet era, the nationalist aspect was officially discouraged in order to quell the rise of nationalist sentiment and Zaporozhian Cossacks&#x27; historical role of defending Muscovy from Turks was celebrated instead. In 1990, the Soviet government and Ukrainian independence movement cooperated to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the Zaporozhian Sich.

Zaporozhian attire, songs, and music found their way into official state dance and music ensembles, and influenced the image of Ukraine in the years to come. Since the Independence of Ukraine in 1991, attempts at restoring the Cossack lifestyle have concentrated on politics, horsemanship and cultural endeavours. In November, 2016, Cossack&#x27;s songs of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast were inscribed on the UNESCO List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding.

Currently the Zaporozhian Cossack stronghold Khortytsia is perceived to be a symbol of Ukrainian statehood.

<text>Nelson Orlando Oduber (born 7 February 1947) is a retired Aruban politician who served as the 2nd Prime Minister of Aruba. Following his defeat in the 2009 Aruban general election, Oduber retired from politics.

== Early life ==
Oduber was born on 7 February 1947, at the Lago Hospital in San Nicolaas, Aruba to Urbano Oduber and Carmen Felepina Croes. He was raised in a Catholic household and had a big family, consisting of 9 sons and 4 sisters. They lived in the Siribana neighborhood in a regular well mannered home. His father worked for Lago Oil and Transport Company and his mother took care of the children. Tragedy struck the family of 15 when his father, who was working for W.E.B at the time, was struck by a high voltage of electricity and received severe burns to the skin, and died on 14 January 1964, leaving behind his wife and 13 children. Oduber was 16 years of age at the time of his father&#x27;s death.

After attending St Joseph Primary school, Oduber attended St Anthony secondary school. He was a disciplined student and always finished his work on time. He graduated M.U.L.O at St. Anthony in 1965. After finishing M.U.L.O, Oduber tried to get a scholarship so he could study abroad, but ultimately did not get it. After being disappointed about the scholarship, he sparked the interest of Dr. Gustavo Oduber, who at the time was Deputy of the insular territory of Aruba and offered Oduber a job as Island Receiver. In 1967, Oduber got the opportunity to move to the Netherlands on a study assignment and lived in Tilburg. In 1970 he finished Public administration at Brabantian Administrative Academy in Tilburg and in 1972 he finished his studies in Constitutional Science.

Oduber&#x27;s tenure as prime minister was plagued with his decision to cancel Aruba&#x27;s exit from the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which subsequently led to his party&#x27;s defeat in the 1994 Aruban general election. following his defeat, Oduber served as Leader of the Opposition within the Parliament of Aruba. following the 2001 Aruban general election Oduber&#x27;s party gained back its majority in parliament and subsequently formed a new government.

<text>Destiny USA (stylized as destiny usa and also known by its former name Carousel Center) is a six-story super-regional shopping, dining, and entertainment complex on the shore of Onondaga Lake in the city of Syracuse, New York. It is the largest shopping mall in the state of New York and the 9th largest in the country. In 2021, Destiny USA was included among the top 20 most visited shopping centers in America, attracting over 26 million visitors a year.

Destiny USA opened on October 15, 1990, as Carousel Center. The mall has six aboveground floors and one underground floor. The lower three floors and the underground floor are used for retail shops. The first and second floors span the length of the mall and house the various shops, vendors, restaurants, and entertainment venues, with the major food court and namesake carousel located on the second floor. The third floor includes a 19-screen Regal Cinemas, restaurants, and entertainment options. The fourth floor is primarily administrative offices. The underground floor, known as the Commons floor, houses medium-sized stores, a chapel, kiosks, and two underground parking garages. The Commons floor does not span the full length of the mall, and is contained within the original mall structure built in 1990.

Destiny USA has outside parking surrounding the mall on nearly all sides. On the Hiawatha Boulevard side, additional parking lots are located across the street from the mall and a pedestrian bridge was built to connect the parking lot to the second floor of the 2012 addition. Parking includes one aboveground and two underground parking garages. The mall is served by CENTRO buses. There are main entrances on nearly all sides of the mall. Other entrances are located through the anchor stores and from the underground parking lots.

In response to a streak of crime starting in 2021, Destiny USA increased security and changed their visitor policy.

==History==
===Background and construction===
The site of Destiny USA was originally a landfill named Marley Scrap Yard, surrounded by several square blocks of oil tanks, collectively named &quot;Oil City&quot;. South of these oil tanks sat the Franklin Square industrial neighborhood. In 1987, The Pyramid Companies studied redevelopment of the neighborhood. In July 1987, The Pyramid Companies announced plans for a shopping center at the scrap yard site. The plan caused controversy with other local shopping centers and malls. The Galleries of Syracuse, a smaller mall (now offices) had recently finished construction in Downtown Syracuse and there was concern that the mall at Oil City would put an end to downtown retail.

Two of the biggest opponents to the project were the competing mall developers in the area, Wilmorite Corp. and Eagan Real Estate Inc, which both operated several malls in Syracuse&#x27;s suburbs. Wilmorite, which was building the Great Northern Mall in the nearby town of Clay, was accused by the Syracuse city government of using associates in Connecticut to form the &quot;Citizen&#x27;s League for an Environmentally Acceptable Northeast,&quot; which lobbied against construction of the Carousel Center mall at Oil City. Eagan meanwhile filed criticism of the mall, claiming that a 25-percent drop in downtown retail sales would occur if the mall were built. It proposed an additional downtown mall with a &quot;Walt Disney-like attraction.&quot;

During construction the mall faced several delays, primarily around environmental cleanup, as the site is a brownfield cleanup site. The mall opened on October 15, 1990, as Carousel Center, named for the 1908 Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters (PTC) carousel, PTC #18 operating within the mall.

===1990s===
When it opened, Carousel Center featured a range of upscale and popular chains. Anchors included Bonwit Teller, Kaufmann&#x27;s, Chappell&#x27;s, Steinbach, JCPenney, Lechmere, and Hills. A basement &quot;Commons&quot; area featured covered parking and additional junior anchors, including The Rx Place and Filene&#x27;s Basement.

Another unique feature of the mall was the Skydeck, which was on the top levels of the central tower. This offered an events space that would be used for fundraisers, proms, fashion shows, concerts, and other public and private uses.

In 1990, The Pyramid Companies began clearing oil tanks south of the mall for a strip center called Carousel Landing, which would feature 650,000 square feet of additional retail.

In 1992, Chappell&#x27;s became The Bon Ton because of a merger with the parent company.

An additional anchor space was built for Lord &amp; Taylor in 1994.

By 1995, Carousel Landing had still not been built due to its potential environmental impact. By 1996, The Pyramid Companies finally got approval to condemn the oil tanks.

In 1996, Steinbach was replaced with Home Place, a Northeast-based upscale home furnishings store. Nobody Beats the Wiz also opened in 1996 in the Commons level.

In November 1997, less than a month after Lechmere closed as a result of parent company Montgomery Ward eliminating the chain, the Pyramid Companies announced they would build an expansion to Carousel Center that would double the mall size instead of building Carousel Landing. Under this plan, the expansion would house about 150 new stores and three anchors, with many of the stores new to the market. The Pyramid Companies officials claimed the expansion would be complete by the year 2000.

In 1998, CompUSA store and a Kahunaville restaurant opened in the Commons Level and Best Buy opened in part of the former HomePlace/Steinbach location.

In 1999, Hills was acquired and rebranded by Ames Department Stores. In March 1999, DSW Shoe Warehouse opened in part of the former Lechmere. In October 1999, Bally Total Fitness opened with a grand opening featuring the cast of &quot;Baywatch&quot;. The Bally Total Fitness filled in the remaining part of HomePlace/Steinbach location that wasn&#x27;t occupied by Best Buy.

===2000s and potential expansions===
In March 2000, Bonwit Teller shuttered their location at the mall as the chain filed for bankruptcy. In the same year, the space became the first American outpost and mall location for H&amp;M. In May, Kaufmann&#x27;s Furniture Galleries opened in the mall.

In 2001, The Pyramid Companies announced an expansion project which would triple the size of the mall, rather than doubling it as previously planned. The new project proposed to rename the mall from Carousel Center to &quot;Destiny USA&quot;. The Skydeck was closed for new administrative offices for the complex. It would also create a large Central New York Visitors Center inside the mall. However, The Pyramid Companies needed public funds and tax breaks to make the project possible and people worried the mall would be obsolete before all of it was recompensated. Despite this, The Pyramid Companies continued to unveil further plans for Destiny USA. Eventually, the large tax breaks and the magnitude of the project would cause much controversy.

In 2004, DSW moved down into the Commons Level while Circuit City took its place. Circuit City previously operated a pocket store in the mall before closing in 2009, after the company failed to find a buyer for itself.

In August 2005, Sports Authority moved in as a new anchor store.

In September 2006, Kaufmann&#x27;s became Macy&#x27;s.

In 2007, The Pyramid Companies proposed the first phase of Destiny USA: a new addition that would add to Carousel Center. This would make Destiny USA the largest mall in New York and the 6th largest in the country. The project was planned to be a green building, powered entirely by renewable resources.

In late 2009, it was announced that Destiny USA would use RFID technology, but would require tenants to turn over profits from the data tracking to Pyramid.

===2010s: Expansion and name change===
In May 2011, an agreement between Citigroup and The Pyramid Companies was finalized and the addition continued. Destiny USA was set to feature a retail mix including entertainment, luxury, and outlet stores. Documents from the trial showed several stores leased in the new expansion. In June 2011, the Syracuse Post-Standard asked people to email ideas of what people would like to see in Destiny USA to the newspaper, with Destiny officials following along. Residents listed several ideas, including entertainment venues like Dave &amp; Buster&#x27;s, and upscale restaurants like P.F. Changs, but nothing was officially announced.

In November 2011, Destiny USA became the largest mall in New York and the 6th largest in the country. Parts of the new addition opened, mostly featuring temporary holiday stores and signs advertising more stores planned for the future.

By late summer of 2012, the CarouselCenter.com webpage merged in with the DestinyUSA.com webpage, as new signage went up. In August 2012, the mall&#x27;s name officially changed to &quot;Destiny USA&quot;, ending all references to Carousel Center. New major stores in the mall included Burlington Coat Factory in the Commons level, Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods, and a P.F. Chang&#x27;s restaurant. New amusement activities opened including WonderWorks, Dave and Buster&#x27;s, Billy Beez Indoor Play Park, APEX Entertainment, a bowling and restaurant venue with a bar and dance area, RPM Raceway Indoor Karting, and Canyon Climb, the world&#x27;s largest indoor rope course.

On June 14, 2013, Regal Cinemas opened their IMAX &amp; RPX screens featuring &quot;Man of Steel&quot; in 3D. The IMAX &amp; RPX feature a separate entrance and concession stand.

On January 4, 2015 it was announced via the Destiny USA website that Nordstrom Rack would be opening. The 33,357-square-foot store, located on the first level, opened in fall of 2015.

In October 2016, At Home opened as a new anchor, replacing Sports Authority, which closed as a result of the company’s bankruptcy.

A $48 million, seven story, 209-room Embassy Suites hotel opened at the Destiny complex in September 2017.

On October 9, 2019, A new LEGO store opened.

===2020s and store number downfall===
The dawn of the early 2020&#x27;s saw several traditional department store retailers update their brick-and-mortar formats in response to the success of digital retailers during this time period.

In June 2020, JCPenney announced that it would close its Destiny USA location.

In August 2020, Lord &amp; Taylor went bankrupt and closed all of its brick-and-mortar stores, as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2021, a new Regal Cinemas 4DX theater was announced, along with renovations to the theaters. An indoor trampoline park called Get Air was also announced.

An upstate New York mall manager said &quot;Retailers were hesitant to sign deals during the pandemic, but as business is beginning to return to normal, leasing activity is picking up&quot;.

By 2023, Destiny USA also announced several newest additions, which include Anthropologie, Ardene, Cuse Ink, Dry Goods Earthbound Trading Co, FYE, Hugo Boss, Offline by Aerie, Lovisa, LoveSac, Hobby Lobby, Rue 21, Untuckit, and Urban Outfitters.

Between May and June 2023, Banana Republic and Sephora closed their stores in Destiny USA. In September of the same year, a representative of Newbury Comics revealed that the collectibles chain would open another location in Destiny USA in October. In the same month, Dry Goods USA, a national retailer that sells clothes for young women, opened on the second level of the mall.

In February 2024, it was announced that Forever 21 will be closing on March 31, 2024.

In March 2024, it was announced that Museum Of Intrigue would be closing the end of April which has been at the mall for 7 years.

On May 7, 2024, it was announced that At Home would be closing in August.

On Thursday, October 24, restaurant chain T.G.I. Fridays announced the closure of its Destiny USA location

On October 29, 2024, it was announced that Nordstrom Rack would be closing on February 1, 2025

On January 22, 2025, the Margaritaville restaurant closed after 10 years.

In spring 2025, a Wetzel&#x27;s Pretzels will be opening.

== Crime and Safety ==

Beginning in 2021, a series of crimes inside and outside the mall led to increases in security.

On January 23, 2021, a 14-year-old boy was stabbed in the back near the Destiny USA parking lot. Two weeks later, Destiny USA announced a change to its parental escort policy. Before the change, minors only had to be accompanied by an adult from 4 p.m. to closing on Fridays and Saturdays. After the change, minors had to be accompanied by an adult at all times, every day. Destiny USA also gave the Syracuse Police Department (SPD) more space on the fifth floor so officers could have a &quot;more expansive, functional work area.&quot;

On December 20, 2021, an unnamed man was shot in the leg at the upper parking lot of Destiny USA. Two months later, a gun was fired in a bathroom during an attempted robbery. Following this incident, Destiny USA hired two to five officers to work as security each day. After Juli Boeheim, wife to former basketball coach Jim Boeheim, had her purse stolen at gunpoint by a 12-year-old, Destiny USA hired more SPD officers to patrol the mall and its parking lots. In addition, probation officers were hired to make sure that individuals on probation weren&#x27;t at the mall.
On February 24, 2023, a 14-year-old shot at &quot;a group he was in a dispute with.&quot; Four months later, an argument inside the mall escalated into a shooting outside one of the entrances of the mall.

These two shootings contributed to the 706 times that Syracuse police were called to the mall from the beginning of 2023 to June 13, 2023. Police were called the most for larceny with 147 calls. Following larceny, 24 calls were for nonviolent abuse toward family and 20 calls were for burglary. The number of police calls since January to June 13 was &quot;nearly 200 higher than the call numbers in 2020, 2021, and 2022.&quot; Sergeant Matthew Malinowski, lieutenant at the time, said that the increase in crime was a result of more people coming to the mall after COVID-19.

By August 9, 2023, Destiny USA installed Flock Safety cameras at every vehicular entrance. The cameras track license plates and alert the police if a wanted or stolen vehicle arrives at the mall.

<text>Patrick Califia (born 1954), formerly also known as Pat Califia and by the last name Califia-Rice, is an American writer of non-fiction essays about sexuality and of erotic fiction and poetry. Califia is a bisexual trans man. Prior to transitioning, Califia identified as a lesbian and wrote for many years a sex advice column for the gay men&#x27;s leather magazine &quot;Drummer&quot;. His writings explore sexuality and gender identity, and have included lesbian erotica and works about BDSM subculture. Califia is a member of the third-wave feminism movement.

==Early life==
Califia was born in Corpus Christi, Texas in 1954 and assigned female at birth. He grew up in Utah in a Latter-day Saint family, the eldest of six children. His father was a construction worker and his mother a housewife. Califia has said he did not have a good childhood, claiming that his father was an angry and violent man and his mother a pious woman.

Califia recalled one incident where he told his parents he wanted to be a train engineer, and they told him he couldn&#x27;t because he was a girl. He replied that he wasn&#x27;t a girl.

In the 1970s, Califia&#x27;s parents had him admitted to a psychiatric hospital, and he dropped out of the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, due to his mental state. Califia came out as a lesbian in 1971 while attending college. He began using the last name &quot;Califia,&quot; after the mythical female warrior Amazon. Califia began to evade his parents, and became involved in the women&#x27;s liberation and anti-war movements. After getting involved in consciousness raising in the area, he moved to San Francisco in 1973, bringing an interest in sex education to work on the San Francisco Sex Information switchboard. After moving to San Francisco he began writing for a magazine and joined a lesbian separatist movement. In 1975 he spoke in favor of sadomasochism and found himself excluded from the lesbian feminist community. He was not only excluded from his nuclear family by coming out as a lesbian but also lost his gay family when speaking his opinions. Califia became increasingly involved in S/M activities not only with lesbians but also with gay men. He co-founded the first lesbian BDSM group in the United States, Samois, in 1978.

==Education==
Califia began attending the University of Utah in Salt Lake City in 1971. In 1981, he graduated from San Francisco State University (SFSU) with a bachelor of arts degree in psychology. He has also said he has a master&#x27;s degree.

==Career and honors==
In 1980, Califia published his first book—&quot;Sapphistry: The Book of Lesbian Sexuality&quot;, a non-fiction work for lesbians which described, in a non-judgmental tone, butch-femme sexuality, and BDSM safety and practice. Subsequently, he published work in lesbian, gay and feminist magazines, including a long-running sex advice column in &quot;The Advocate&quot;.

Califia is &quot;one of [the] earliest champions of lesbian sadomasochistic sex&quot; whose &quot;work has been taught on college campuses across the country and abroad.&quot; He has a long history of transgression, identifying as a feminist, lesbian, and transgender while also at times finding rejection from those communities &quot;for various infractions.&quot; He played what some observers termed a &quot;notable role&quot; in the Feminist Sex Wars of the 1970s/1980s. The sides were characterized by anti-porn feminist and sex-positive feminist groups with disagreements regarding sexuality, pornography and other forms of sexual representation, prostitution, the role of trans women in the lesbian community, lesbian sexual practices, sadomasochism, and other sexual issues. Califia rejected the &quot;essentialist, feminist ideology—that women are better, more nurturing, more peaceful, more loving, more relationship-oriented and less raunchy in bed,&quot; instead advocating for BDSM, &quot;the consensual integration of power, pain, domination and submission into sex.&quot; According to the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, many feminists were won over to Califia&#x27;s views on S/M not from his arguments, but from his erotic fiction: &quot;they read Califia-Rice&#x27;s S/M fantasies, got turned on and got over it.&quot;

In 1979, as a student in psychology at San Francisco State University, his research was published in the &quot;Journal of Homosexuality&quot;.

Califia co-founded Samois, a lesbian-feminist BDSM organization based in San Francisco that existed from 1978 to 1983, and shifted his focus to the lesbian experience of BDSM. The Samois Collective produced, with Califia&#x27;s contributions, the book &quot;Coming to Power&quot;, published by Alyson Publications. &quot;Coming To Power&quot;, according to Heather Findlay, editor-in-chief of lesbian magazine &quot;Girlfriends&quot;, was &quot;one of the most transformative lesbian books, [foretelling] the end of a certain puritanism that had dominated the community. It was the first articulate defense of lesbian S/M, and that was the end of it.&quot; Another book, the &quot;Lesbian S/M Safety Manual&quot;, won the 1990 Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year.

In 1989, Califia and Geoff Mains received the Steve Maidhof Award for National or International Work from the National Leather Association International.

In 1992, Califia received the Woman of the Year award as part of the Pantheon of Leather Awards.

Also in 1992, Califia founded the leatherwomen&#x27;s quarterly &quot;Venus Infers&quot; and published &quot;Feminism, Paedophilia, and Children&#x27;s Rights&quot; in a special women&#x27;s issue of the pro-pedophile scholarly journal &quot;Paidika&quot;. Califia has asserted that he &#x27;support[s] &quot;Paidika&quot; and enjoyed working with the editors of this special issue&#x27;. Califia has asserted that all age of consent laws should be repealed, describing pedophilia as &#x27;erotic initiation&#x27;. In &#x27;Public Sex: The Culture of Radical Sex&#x27;, Califia criticized anti child abuse / anti child pornography laws because they are applied disproportionately to gay men, commenting that he &#x27;knew several gay men who proudly called themselves boy-lovers&#x27;, and criticized federal laws against child abuse imagery because they would have &#x27;guaranteed that it [child abuse imagery] would disappear from the shelves of adult book stores&#x27;. Califia additionally supported the pedophilia advocacy organization North American Man/Boy Love Association. After becoming a parent, Califia reconsidered his stance on the age of consent and adult / child sex: &#x27;I was naive about the developmental issues that make sex between adults and prepubescent children unacceptable,&#x27;; &#x27;I&#x27;ve become much more cynical about the ability of adults to listen to children&#x27;; &#x27;Perhaps because I am a parent now, I am less idealistic about the possibilities for an equal adult / child relationship&#x27;.

In 1996, he was co-editor, with Robin Sweeney, of &quot;The Second Coming: A Leatherdyke Reader&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Coming to Power&quot;. Califia was writing about queer studies and gender identity, and coming to terms with these issues on a personal level. At age 45, Califia transitioned, taking the name Patrick.

In 2000, Califia received the Forebear Award as part of the Pantheon of Leather Awards.

In a 2000 interview, Califia explained that the inspiration for his erotic writings varies; sometimes it is just about having fun, or it can be satire, or exploring a sexuality issue like HIV-positive people barebacking with the intention of infecting the other person with the virus. In the interview with Rona Marech, Califia is quoted as saying:
It&#x27;s about me trying to put a human face on that and understand that from the inside out. ...It&#x27;s about being thought-provoking, hopefully. And I like (presenting issues) that challenge the reader; that are maybe a little scary, maybe hard to think about. ...It&#x27;s also a way to top a lot of people. In some ways, I get to do a scene with everyone who reads one [sic] my books.

Janet Hardy, of Greenery Press, admires Califia&#x27;s tenacity, stating, &quot;He&#x27;s got a phenomenal mind... He&#x27;s willing to get a hold of a thought and follow it through to the end, even if it doesn&#x27;t feel comfortable.&quot;

Califia was nominated for the Lambda Literary Awards for his short-story collection, &quot;Macho Sluts&quot; (1988), his novel, &quot;Doc and Fluff: The Dystopian Tale of a Girl and Her Biker&quot; (1990), and a compilation of his columns, &quot;The Advocate Adviser&quot; (1991). He is working on a book that discusses the topic of FTM sexuality, and is working on a new set of essays surrounding the topic of BDSM. He has also written vampire books.

Califia presented a paper for the American Academy of Religion conference in Montréal, November 19–22, 2009, on the gay marriage debate, and how arguments about monogamy and S/M have been used to try to control the argument.

When Califia would travel to Canada, his pornographic works were often seized by Canadian customs, until he fought a court case to allow them to be accepted. Afterwards, he wrote of his amusement at finding that anti-porn feminist Catherine Itzin&#x27;s book &quot;Pornography: Women, Violence and Civil Liberties&quot; was seized under the very law he had helped to establish, while Califia&#x27;s books were recognized as acceptable by that law. Califia fought against anti-pornography legislation co-authored by Catharine MacKinnon.

In 2013, he was named by Equality Forum as one of their 31 Icons of the LGBT History Month.

From 2001 to 2011, Califia was licensed in California as a marriage and family therapist (MFT).

Califia is an inductee of the Society of Janus Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Califia has a son, Blake Califia-Rice (born October 1999), to whom his ex-partner, Matt Rice, a trans man, gave birth.

Califia has said that, since the 1990s, he has had fibromyalgia.

Califia has said he incorporates elements of Mormonism in his approach to life. One tenet of Mormonism he said he believes in is &quot;if the truth has been revealed to you and you don&#x27;t speak out, you are culpable for any wrongs that are committed in those realms of life.&quot;

===Transition===
In 1999, Califia decided to begin hormone replacement therapy as a part of his transition. Califia had considered sex reassignment in his twenties, but had been hesitant, for one reason, because there were many dangers to the surgery at that time. He also hesitated because his career had been built around a reputation as a lesbian writer and activist. Califia had entered age-related perimenopause when he began his transition. He has stated that being a man or a woman was never a good fit for him but sex reassignment seemed to be the most reasonable option.

<text>Clarence Addison Dykstra ( ; February 25, 1883 – May 6, 1950) was a U.S. government administrator. He served as city manager in Cincinnati, Ohio, after teaching government at the University of Chicago. He then became president of the University of Wisconsin (1937–1945) as well as the 1st Director of the Selective Service System between 1940 and 1941. He then became provost of UCLA from 1945 to 1950.

He also served as the efficiency director of the city&#x27;s Department of Water and Power for Los Angeles before World War II. He argued that the city needed to be further decentralized by expanding highways and creating suburban communities.

Dykstra was appointed by President Roosevelt to chair the 11-member National Defense Mediation Board, an effort to settle wartime disputes. He served from March 19 to July 1, 1941.

Because Dykstra had already served as a university president before coming to UCLA, he &quot;was incensed at what he considered demeaning treatment of the provost by UC’s universitywide administration&quot;. During his five years at UCLA, he was popular and loved by the UCLA community. His &quot;death on the job was a galvanizing event at UCLA and among the southern regents&quot; which fueled political momentum towards decentralization of the university bureaucracy.

Dykstra was also the first to advocate for and bring about the construction of student housing at UCLA. Dykstra Hall, which opened in 1959, was the first structure in UCLA&#x27;s current undergraduate residential community. It was also the first co-ed residence hall in the country.

<text>Jóannes Dan Eidesgaard (born 19 April 1951) is a former Faroese politician. He was the prime minister of the Faroe Islands from 2004, starting shortly after the general election of 20 January 2004, until 26 September 2008, when a new coalition took office. He served as finance minister from 1996 to 1998 and again from 2008 to 2011. He was a member of the Danish Folketing representing the Faroe Islands from 11 March 1998 until 20 November 2001.

== Life and political career ==
Jóannes Eidesgaard was born on 19 April 1951, in Tvøroyri on the island of Suðuroy, where he later became a senior-school teacher.

Eidesgaard was first elected to the Løgting, the Faroese parliament, in 1990. Between 1991 and 1996 he was a Minister under different coalition governments, and from 1994 to 1996 he became Deputy Prime Minister. In 1996 Eidesgaard became Party Chairman of the Javnaðarflokkurin.

In 1998, up until 2001, Eidesgaard was one of the two Faroese delegates in the Parliament of Denmark.

On 3 February 2004 Jóannes Eidesgaard was elected prime minister and therefore became head of the government in the Faroe Islands. He led a coalition government between the Unionist Party, the People’s Party and the Social Democratic Party.

After the 2008 elections, he led a centre-left separatist government consisting of his Social Democratic Party, the pro-independence Republic and the Centre Party.

In September the coalition collapsed, and a new coalition between Unionist Party, the People’s Party and the Social Democratic Party was re-established on 24 September. As a result of the ongoing debates about who should be the new prime minister, Jóannes Eidesgaard decided to step down as prime minister to allow Kaj Leo Johannesen of the Unionist Party to assume that office as a compromise. Kaj Leo Johannesen assumed the office on 26 September.

On 30 September 2008 shortly after making the 2009 Faroese budget public, Jóannes Eidesgaard was admitted to hospital after feeling chest pains. He recovered and continued his political work, but in 2011 he ended his political career.

<text>Richard Dybeck (1 September 1811 – 28 July 1877) was a Swedish jurist, antiquarian, and lyricist. He is mainly remembered as the author of the lyrics to what is now the de facto Swedish national anthem, &quot;Du gamla, Du fria&quot;.

==Biography==
Dybeck was born in the rectory of Odensvi parish, just outside the town of Köping in Västmanland, Sweden. He was the son of a clergyman, went to gymnasium in Västerås, and later matriculated at Uppsala University in 1831 with a law degree. He completed his civil service degree in law () in 1834 and entered the Svea Court of Appeal (). He held a number of positions in the court system during the following years, but eventually began to spend all his time on his antiquarian and historical research, not least in the field of runestones.
Dybeck wrote many poems. He was also known to have a keen interest in Asian culture, as was seen by his collection of historic prints and lithographs which originated from places such as Myanmar and China. Dybeck died in 1877 at Södertälje and was buried at Norra begravningsplatsen in Stockholm.

At Dybecksgården in Odensvi, Richard Dybeck&#x27;s bust is in bronze by Signe Ehrenborg-Lorichs, which was unveiled by Prince Wilhelm in 1937.

<text>Coconut milk is an opaque, milky-white liquid extracted from the grated pulp of mature coconuts. The opacity and rich taste of coconut milk are due to its high oil content, most of which is saturated fat. Coconut milk is a traditional food ingredient used in Southeast Asia, Oceania, South Asia, and East Africa. It is also used for cooking in the Caribbean, Central America, northern parts of South America and West Africa, where coconuts were introduced during the colonial era.

Coconut milk is differentiated into subtypes based on fat content. They can be generalized into coconut cream (or thick coconut milk) with the highest amount of fat; coconut milk (or thin coconut milk) with a maximum of around 20% fat; and coconut skim milk with negligible amounts of fat. This terminology is not always followed in commercial coconut milk sold in Western countries.

Coconut milk can also be used to produce milk substitutes (differentiated as &quot;coconut milk beverages&quot;). These products are not the same as regular coconut milk products which are meant for cooking, not drinking. A sweetened, processed, coconut milk product from Puerto Rico is also known as &quot;cream of coconut&quot;. It is used in many desserts and beverages like the piña colada, though it should not be confused with coconut cream.

==Nutrition==
In a 100 milliliter (ml) portion, coconut milk contains 230 kilocalories and is 68% water, 24% total fat, 6% carbohydrates, and 2% protein (table). The fat composition includes 21 grams of saturated fat, half of which is lauric acid (table).

Coconut milk is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of manganese (40% DV per 100 g), with no other micronutrients in significant content (table for USDA source).

==Definition and terminology==
Coconut milk is a relatively stable oil-in-water emulsion with proteins that act as emulsifiers and thickening agents. It is opaque and milky white in color and ranges in consistency from watery to creamy. Based on fat content, coconut milk is divided into different subtypes generally simplified into &quot;coconut cream&quot;, &quot;coconut milk&quot;, and &quot;coconut skim milk&quot;, from highest to lowest respectively. Coconut milk and coconut cream (also called &quot;thin coconut milk&quot; and &quot;thick coconut milk&quot;, respectively) are traditionally differentiated in countries where coconuts are native based on the stages of extraction. They are also differentiated in modern standards set by the Asian and Pacific Coconut Community (APCC) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). However, the terminologies are not always followed in commercial coconut milk (especially in western countries) because these standards are not mandatory. This can cause confusion among consumers.

The Asian and Pacific Coconut Community standardizes coconut milk and coconut cream products as:

The Codex Alimentarius of the FAO standardizes coconut milk and coconut cream products as:

Coconut milk can also sometimes be confused with coconut water. Coconut water is the clear fluid found within the coconut seed, while coconut milk is the extracted liquid derived from the manual or mechanical crushing of the white inner flesh of mature coconuts. Coconut cream should also not be confused with creamed coconut, which is a semi-solid paste made from finely ground coconut pulp, and cream of coconut, which is a processed product made from heavily sweetened coconut cream.

==Traditional preparation==

Coconut milk is traditionally made by grating the white inner flesh of mature coconuts and mixing the shredded coconut pulp with a small amount of hot water in order to suspend the fat present in the grated pulp. The grating process can be carried out manually or by machine. Polynesians may use special bundles of fibre from sea hibiscus, heliconia or the coconut itself called &quot;tauaga&quot; to wring the milk from the meat.
Coconut milk is traditionally divided into two grades: coconut cream (or thick coconut milk) and thin coconut milk. Coconut cream contains around 20% to 50% fat; while thin coconut milk contains 5% to 20% fat.
Coconut cream is extracted from the first pressings of grated coconut pulp directly through cheesecloth. Sometimes a small amount of hot water may also be added, but generally coconut cream is extracted with no added water. Thin coconut milk, on the other hand, is produced by the subsequent pressings after soaking the squeezed coconut pulp with hot water.

Gravity separation can also be used to derive a top layer of coconut cream and a bottom layer of coconut skim milk. This is achieved by simply allowing the extracted liquid to stand for an hour. Conversely, coconut cream can be diluted into thinner coconut milk by simply adding water.
Traditionally prepared coconut milk is utilized immediately after being freshly extracted because it spoils easily when exposed to air. It becomes rancid after a few hours at room temperatures due to lipid oxidation and lipolysis. Rancid coconut milk gives off a strong unpleasant smell and has a distinctive soapy taste.
As coconut cream contains a higher amount of soluble, suspended solids, it works well as a good ingredient for desserts and rich and dry sauces. On the other hand, thin milk contains less amount of these soluble solids. Thus, it is mainly used in general cooking. The distinction between coconut cream and thin coconut milk is not usually made in western nations due to the fact that fresh coconut milk is uncommon in these countries and most consumers buy coconut milk in cartons or cans.

Coconut milk is also an intermediate step in the traditional wet process methods of producing virgin coconut oil by gradual heating, churning, or fermentation. These methods, however, are less efficient than coconut oil production from copra.

===Coconut graters===

Coconut graters (also called &quot;coconut scrapers&quot;), a necessary tool for traditionally extracting coconut milk, were part of the material culture of the Austronesian peoples. From Island Southeast Asia, it was carried along with the sea voyages of the Austronesian expansion both for colonization and trade, reaching as far as Polynesia in the east, and Madagascar and the Comoros in the west in prehistoric times. The technology also spread to non-Austronesian cultures in coastal East Africa by proximity. Manual coconut graters remain a standard kitchen equipment in households in the tropical Asia-Pacific and Eastern Africa, underscoring the importance of coconut milk and coconut oil extraction in the Indo-Pacific. 

The basic design of coconut graters consists of a low bench or stool with a horizontal serrated disk (made of metal in Asia and Africa, and stone or shell in Oceania) attached on one end. A person sits on the bench and repeatedly scrapes the inner surface of halved coconut shells with both hands over the metal disk. The scrapings are gathered by a container placed below.

More modern mechanical coconut graters dating back to the mid-1800s consist of serrated blades with a hand crank. This version is believed to be a British invention.

==Processed coconut milk products==

Commercially processed coconut milk products use largely the same processes to extract coconut milk from pulp, though they use more mechanical equipment like deshelling machines, grinders and pulverizers, motorized coconut shredders, and coconut milk extractors.
They differ significantly in the bottling or canning process, however. Processed coconut milk products are first filtered through a 100 mesh filters. They are pasteurized indirectly by double boiling at around , carefully not exceeding , the temperature at which coconut milk starts to coagulate. After pasteurization, they are immediately transferred to filling vessels and sealed before being cooled down. They are then packed into bottles, cans, or pouches and blast frozen for storage and transport.

Manufacturers of canned coconut milk typically combine diluted and comminuted milk with the addition of water as a filler. Depending on the brand and age of the milk itself, a thicker, more paste-like consistency floats to the top of the can (a gravity separation, similar to traditional methods), and is sometimes separated and used in recipes that require coconut cream rather than coconut milk. Some brands sold in Western countries undergo homogenization and contain additional thickening agents and emulsifiers to prevent the milk from separating inside the can.

Due to factors like pasteurization and minimal contact with oxygen, processed coconut milk generally has a longer shelf life than traditionally prepared coconut milk. It is also more efficient than traditional methods at extracting the maximum amount of coconut milk from grated coconut.

===Coconut milk powder===

Coconut cream can be dehydrated into coconut milk powder which has a far longer shelf life. It is produced by adding maltodextrin and casein to coconut cream to improve fluidity and then spray drying the mixture. The powder is packaged in moisture-proof containers. To use, water is simply added to the coconut milk powder.

===Coconut skim milk===
Coconut skim milk is coconut milk with very low levels of fat (0% to 1.5%). It is a byproduct of coconut cream and coconut oil production and is usually discarded. However, it is increasingly being used as a food ingredient for products which require coconut flavoring without the fats (including coconut powder, coconut honey, and coconut jam). It can also be used as a base in the production of coconut milk beverages used as milk substitutes, as it does not contain the high levels of fat characteristic of regular coconut milk while still being a good source of soluble proteins.

===Milk substitutes===

Processed coconut milk can be used as a substitute for milk beverages, usually marketed as &quot;coconut milk beverage&quot;. They are sometimes confusingly also simply labeled as &quot;coconut milk&quot;, though they are not the same product as coconut milk used for cooking (which is not meant for drinking). Milk substitutes from coconut are basically coconut milk diluted with water or coconut skim milk with additives. They contain less fat and fewer calories than milk, but also less protein. They contain high amounts of potassium and are good sources of fiber and iron. They are also commonly fortified with vitamin D and calcium.

===Filled milk===

Coconut milk is also used widely for filled milk products. It is blended with milk (usually skim milk or powdered milk) for its vegetable oils and proteins which act as substitutes for expensive butterfat in some processed milk products. They include low-fat filled milk, evaporated reconstituted milk, and sweetened condensed milk.

===Cheese and custard production===
Coconut milk can also be used in cheese and custard production, substituting at most 50% of milk without lowering the overall quality of the products. By mixing skim milk with coconut milk, one procedure develops cheeses – including a garlic-spiced soft cheese called &quot;queso de ajo&quot;, a Gouda cheese substitute, and a Roquefort substitute called &quot;Niyoblue&quot; (a portmanteau of , &quot;coconut&quot;, and &quot;blue&quot;).

===Soy milk enrichment===
Coconut milk can be used to enrich the fat content of soy milk, improving its texture and taste to be closer to that of real milk. Coconut cream can also be added to soy milk in the production of tofu to enrich its caloric density without affecting its palatability.

===Cream of coconut===
Cream of coconut is a thick, heavily sweetened, processed coconut milk product resembling condensed milk. It was originally produced by the Puerto Rican company Coco López and is used most notably in piña coladas in the United States. It can also be used for other cocktail drinks and various desserts. It should not be confused with or used as a substitute for coconut cream.

==Cuisine==
===Coconut milk derivatives===

In the Philippines, coconut milk can also be further processed into coconut caramel and coconut curds, both known as &quot;latík&quot;. The coconut caramel &quot;latík&quot; made from a reduction of muscovado sugar and coconut milk has been developed into a commercial product marketed as coconut syrup (not to be confused with coconut sugar derived from coconut sap).
A similar product found throughout Southeast Asia is coconut jam. It is known as &quot;matamís sa báo&quot; in the Philippines and uses only coconut milk and sugar. However, the coconut jam versions from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore (&quot;kaya&quot;); Thailand (&quot;sangkhaya&quot;); Cambodia (&quot;sankiah&quot;); and Vietnam (&quot;banh gan&quot;), add eggs in addition to sugar. The latter versions are sometimes anglicized as &quot;coconut custard&quot; to distinguish them from the version without egg. Coconut jam and coconut custard have a thicker, jam-like consistency and are used as ingredients or fillings in various traditional desserts.

===Food===

Coconut milk can be used in both sweet and savory dishes. In many tropical and Asian cuisines, it is a traditional ingredient in curries and other dishes, including desserts.

====Southeast Asia====
In Indonesia, coconut milk is used in various recipes ranging from savoury dishes – such as , , , , , , , and to sweet desserts, such as , and . Soto is ubiquitous in Indonesia and considered one of Indonesia&#x27;s national dishes. It is also used in coconut rice, a widespread Southeast Asian dish of rice cooked in coconut milk, including the of Malaysia and the of Indonesia.

In Malaysia, coconut milk is one of the essential ingredients in a lot of the dishes, this includes a few of the popular dishes in the region, such as the ubiquitous and , , , and Tamil and Mamak style-curry, it is also used in dessert-making such as , and .

In the Philippines, diverse dishes cooked in coconut milk are called . They can range from savoury dishes to desserts. Coconut milk is widely used to make traditional Filipino (the generic term for rice pastries), including and , among others.

In Thailand, coconut milk is used in dishes such as &quot;tom kha kai&quot;, &quot;khao tom mat&quot;, &quot;mango sticky rice&quot;, and &quot;tom yum&quot;.

====Latin America and the Caribbean====
In Brazil, coconut milk is mostly used in northeastern cuisine, generally with seafood stews and desserts. In Venezuela, pulp dishes are prepared with coconut milk and shredded fish in a dish called . In Colombia and Panama, the grated flesh of coconut and coconut milk are used to make sweet , a key ingredient in making (coconut rice).

Coconut milk is used to make traditional Venezuelan dishes, such as (a typical Venezuelan dessert), and (the Venezuelan version of coconut rice).

===Drink===

In Southeast Asia, coconut milk is used to make many traditional drinks. &quot;Cendol&quot; is a popular iced drink from this region containing chilled coconut milk and green jellies made of rice flour. Coconut milk is also used in hot drinks such as &quot;bandrek&quot; and &quot;bajigur&quot;, two popular drinks from Indonesia. Sweetened coconut milk, and coconut milk diluted with water are two popular coconut beverages in southern China and Taiwan.

The jelly-like pulp from the inside of the coconut is often added to coconut water to make a tropical drink. In Brazil, for example, coconut milk is mixed with sugar and &quot;cachaça&quot; to make a cocktail called . Puerto Rico is also popular for tropical drinks containing coconut, such as &quot;piña colada&quot; and &quot;coquito&quot;, which typically contain coconut milk or coconut cream.

==Saturated fat and health risk==
One of the most prominent components of coconut milk is coconut oil, which many health organizations discourage people from consuming in significant amounts due to its high levels of saturated fat. Excessive coconut milk consumption can also raise blood levels of cholesterol due to the amount of lauric acid, a saturated fat that contributes to higher blood cholesterol.

==Horticulture==
In 1943, it was discovered that coconut milk could actively encourage plant growth. Although there are many factors that attribute coconut milk to plant growth, the main cause is the existence of a cytokinin known as zeatin found in coconut milk. While the zeatin in coconut milk speeds up plant growth in general, it does not speed up growth in certain plants such as radishes. However, when 10% coconut milk is added to the substrate on which wheat is grown, substantial improvements have been noted.

==Commerce==
Coconuts are widely produced in tropical climates and exported globally as canned products, most frequently to North America and Europe.

<text>Frankie Billy Randall (September 25, 1961 – December 23, 2020) was an American professional boxer who competed from 1983 to 2005. He was a three-time light welterweight world champion, having held the WBA and WBC titles between 1994 and 1997. Randall is best known for being the first boxer to defeat Julio César Chávez, whose record at the time of their 1994 fight stood at 89 wins and a draw.

==Professional career==
Randall was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and grew up in Morristown, Tennessee. He turned pro in 1981 after a career as an amateur boxer. He won his pro debut in June of that year, but was inactive in 1982 and did not fight again until February 1983.

Randall fought and won 23 times between 1983 and June 1985, when he fought former and future champ Edwin Rosario and lost a unanimous decision over 10 rounds.

On July 4, 1986, Randall drew with Freddie Pendleton for the USBA regional lightweight title, then watched Pendleton get a title shot instead of him. In October 1987, Randall was knocked out by Mexican lightweight champion Primo Ramos for the NABF regional belt.

Randall then signed with promoter Don King and spent the next six and a half years fighting on the undercards of various championship fights promoted by King. He won all 17 of those fights, and on January 30, 1993, earned another title shot when he knocked out Rosario in the seventh round of a rematch.

===Randall vs. Chávez===

On January 29, 1994, Randall fought for the title against champion Julio César Chávez, in the grand opening of the MGM Grand Garden in Las Vegas. Chávez came into the fight with an 89-0-1 record and was an 18-to-1 favorite.
Randall won the early rounds, and in the middle of the fight began to build a large lead on the scorecards. Chávez then rallied, and by the 10th round, Randall held a narrow lead. Chávez made an illegal low blow that cost Chávez a point. In the 11th round, Randall knocked Chávez down for the first time in his career. Randall was named WBC light welterweight champion on a split decision. Chavez disputed the decision and demanded a rematch. Though clearly beaten, Chávez blamed his loss on the referee who deducted two points from Chávez for low blows. This included one in the eleventh round that made the difference on judge Angel Guzman&#x27;s card, making the ultimate difference on the scorecards. (Guzman scored the bout 114–113 for Randall, meaning that the fight would have ended in a draw as Chuck Giampa had Randall winning by a 116–111 margin and Abraham Chavarria scored it 114–113 for Chavez.)

===Rematch against Chávez===

Chávez got a rematch on May 7 of the same year and regained the title from Randall on an eight-round technical split decision. As before, a deducted point played a part in the outcome of the fight. Chavez was injured in an accidental clash of heads and unable to continue. Randall was docked a point for the incident. Judge Dalby Shirley&#x27;s scorecard read 76–75 for Chavez; with judge Ray Solis having Chavez winning by a 77–74 margin on his card and judge Tamotsu Tomihara had the fight 76–75 in Randall&#x27;s favor.

On September 17, Randall was given a shot at the WBA version of the light welterweight title held by Juan Martin Coggi. He beat Coggi, defended his title twice, then lost a rematch to Coggi in January 1996 in a four-round decision in a fight ended early by a clash of heads.

Seven months later, Randall regained the WBA title, beating Coggi by unanimous decision in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He lost it in his first defense, against Khalid Rahilou on January 11, 1997.

After taking 18 months off, Randall came back in an attempt to become a four-time world champ. He won a pair of tune-up fights, then faced contender Oba Carr in February 1999 where Carr beat him on a 10-round unanimous decision.

===Third fight against Chávez===
On May 22, 2004, Chávez chose Randall for his last fight before going into retirement. Randall lost a 10-round decision to Chávez in Mexico City.

===PED allegations===
Frankie Randall tested positive for drugs after his fight against Argentine boxer Juan Martin Coggi. The Argentine Boxing Federation claimed that Randall tested positive for multiple drugs, some of the drugs included cocaine and theophylline.

===Retirement===
Randall announced his retirement on January 1, 2005, after losing a fight to light-middleweight Marco Antonio Rubio. He lost a bout the following month to Mauro Lucero, and another bout later in the year. Randall&#x27;s final career record is 58 wins, 18 losses and one draw, with 42 wins by way of knockout.

===Death===
Randall died on December 23, 2020, in his hometown of Morristown, Tennessee. The cause of death was reportedly of dementia pugilistica

<doc id="743332" wikidata="Q953999" url="?curid=743332" title="California gull">
<text>The California gull (Larus californicus) is a medium-sized gull, smaller on average than the herring gull, but larger on average than the ring-billed gull (though it may overlap in size with both). Although named after California, it can be found annually across most of western North America, from the Canadian prairie provinces in the northeast and south through western Mexico.

==Description==
Adults are similar in appearance to the herring gull, but with brown eyes, yellow legs, and a more rounded head. The body is mainly white with grey back and upper wings. The bill is yellow with a black ring and red spot near the tip. They have black primaries with white tips. Immature birds are also similar in appearance to immature herring gulls, with browner plumage than immature ring-billed gulls. Length can range from , the wingspan and body mass can vary from .

== Distribution and habitat ==

The breeding habitat of the California gull are lakes and marshes in interior western North America from the Northwest Territories, Canada south to eastern California and Colorado. They nest in colonies, sometimes with other birds. The nest is a shallow depression on the ground lined with vegetation and feathers. The female usually lays 2 or 3 eggs. Both parents take turns feeding their chicks.

California gulls are migratory, with most moving to the Pacific coast in winter, during which time they can regularly be found in western California.

== Behavior ==
These birds forage in flight or pick up objects while swimming, walking or wading. They mainly eat insects, fish and the eggs and young of other birds, especially ducklings. Opportunistic feeders, California gulls often can be seen scavenging at garbage dumps, marinas and docks. They may follow fishing boats and plows in fields for insects stirred up by this activity. They frequently beg for food at public beaches, parks and other locations where people will hand feed them. They have been known to steal food from people at picnics and outdoor restaurants.

California gulls are also known to eat various vegetables and fruits, particularly cherries. As a result, in some areas it may be regarded as a crop pest.

== State bird ==
The California gull is the state bird of Utah, remembered for assisting Mormon settlers in dealing with a plague of Mormon crickets. A monument in Salt Lake City commemorates this event, known as the &quot;Miracle of the Gulls&quot;.

==Subspecies==
There are two subspecies recognized, the nominate from the Great Basin to central Montana and Wyoming, and the slightly larger, paler &quot;L. c. albertaensis&quot; with a more northerly distribution, ranging from Great Slave Lake onto the Great Plains of western Manitoba and South Dakota. Although these subspecies are not well distinguishable by mtDNA allozyme variation, they breed true and the low genetic divergence can be explained by separation during the Pleistocene and renewed contact in Montana during more recent times.

==Status in California==
In California, the California gull at one time held the protected status California Species of Special Concern due to declining numbers at their historic California breeding colony at Mono Lake. However, in recent decades this species has begun to breed in the southern portion of San Francisco Bay, where it did not historically breed, and has undergone exponential population growth. These California gulls now inhabit large, remote salt-production ponds and levees and have a very large food source provided by nearby landfills from San Francisco, San Jose and other urban areas, all the way up into the Sacramento area. The South Bay California gull population has grown from less than 1,000 breeding birds in 1982 to over 33,000 in 2006. This population boom has resulted in large resident flocks of gulls that will opportunistically prey on other species, particularly the eggs and nestlings of other birds. Seriously threatened birds that share the same South Bay habitat include the snowy plover and California least tern, while less-threatened birds, including black-necked stilts, American avocets, Forster&#x27;s terns, and Caspian terns, are also preyed upon by the abnormally large flocks of California gulls. Efforts are underway to reduce habitat for this species and find other ways to disperse the large numbers of gulls.
