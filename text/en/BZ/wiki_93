<text>Allen Fieldhouse is an indoor arena on the University of Kansas (KU) campus in Lawrence, Kansas. It is home of the Kansas Jayhawks men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams. The arena is named after Phog Allen, a former player and head coach for the Jayhawks whose tenure lasted 39 years. The arena&#x27;s nickname, The Phog also pays homage to Allen. Allen Fieldhouse is one of college basketball&#x27;s most historically significant and prestigious buildings. 37 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Tournament games have been hosted at the arena. The actual playing surface has been named &quot;James Naismith Court&quot;, in honor of basketball&#x27;s inventor, who established KU&#x27;s basketball program and served as the Jayhawks&#x27; first coach from 1898 to 1907.

Allen Fieldhouse has also hosted several NCAA tournament regionals, an NBA exhibition game, and occasional concerts such as The Beach Boys, Elton John, James Taylor, Sonny and Cher, Leon Russell, Alice Cooper, ZZ Top, Tina Turner, Harry Belafonte, Henry Mancini, The Doobie Brothers, Kansas, and Bob Hope, as well as speakers, including former President Bill Clinton in 2004, Senator Robert F. Kennedy (which drew over 20,000) in March 1968, and anarchist Abbie Hoffman in 1970. Additional free musical performances occasionally occur during the Jayhawks Late Night In The Phog, musical artists that have performed for this include Tech N9ne, Lil Yachty, 2 Chainz, Snoop Dogg, Run-DMC, and DIESEL. Allen Fieldhouse was the filming location for a climactic hospital scene in the 1983 ABC-TV movie &quot;The Day After&quot;, one of the most-watched made-for-TV movies of all-time.

&quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot; named Allen Fieldhouse the loudest college basketball arena in the country. The arena broke the Guinness World Record for loudest roar on February 13, 2017, against West Virginia at 130.4 dB. The prior record of 126.4 dB at Kentucky&#x27;s Rupp Arena which lasted less than three weeks also had many Kansas fans present as the Jayhawks beat the No. 4 Wildcats 79–73 in the Big 12/SEC Challenge. Arrowhead Stadium, which is only 42 miles away, owns the record for loudest outdoor stadium.

Allen Fieldhouse is often considered one of the best home court advantages in men&#x27;s college basketball. Despite the venue being open for almost 70 years, entering the 2023-24 season, Kansas men&#x27;s team has only lost 117 games at Allen Fieldhouse and only 19 under head coach Bill Self. Their most recent loss at home came on January 25th, 2025 to the University of Houston Cougars. The Jayhawks entered the 2023-24 season with 352 consecutive sellouts dating back to the 2001–02 season. Twenty times since the venue opened, the Jayhawks have finished the season undefeated at home.

==History==

The construction of Allen Fieldhouse began in 1952, but quickly ground to a halt because of a federal mandate restricting steel consumption following the Second World War and during the Korean War. However, university officials were able to find a loophole: by adding some rooms for gun and weapons storage, construction of the building was able to continue under the guise of an &quot;armory.&quot;
Allen Fieldhouse was dedicated on March 1, 1955, a ten-point victory over rival Kansas State. Renovations have included minor seating expansions in 1986 and 1994, as well as accessibility upgrades in 1999 to modernize concession stands and restroom facilities, and to install an elevator in the south end. Handicapped seating was moved courtside behind both baskets in 2001.

The concourse was originally an indoor track. At times the Fieldhouse has been home to men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, indoor track and field, volleyball, and practice facilities for the American football and softball teams. Since additional facilities were constructed to accommodate many of those needs, it is now used primarily for basketball.

Max Falkenstien was a stalwart figure in the radio booth, working every home game in Allen Fieldhouse from its construction to his retirement in 2006, 51 years later.

Renovations completed in 2005 include a thorough cleaning of the exterior, and the creation of a new Booth Family Hall of Athletics facility on the east side of the Fieldhouse, funded by David G. Booth and his family. Interior renovations include a new hardwood court, new windows, and a multimillion-dollar video board and sound system. After 2006, new banners for the retired jerseys and conference and national championships were installed.

Renovations completed in 2009 include an expansion of the Booth Family Hall of Athletics and the creation of a donor atrium, as well as improved concessions, wider concourses, and restroom upgrades. The building also received brand new locker rooms, training rooms, film rooms, and player lounges. A pedestrian bridge connecting the Fieldhouse to the existing facility parking garage was also constructed. The improvements cost approximately $7.8 million.

In December 2010, the Booth family announced they had purchased the founding document of the game of basketball, Naismith&#x27;s original 13 Rules of Basketball. The document will be permanently housed in an addition to Allen Fieldhouse called the &quot;DeBruce Center&quot;. The story behind the Booth family purchasing the document from a Sotheby&#x27;s auction from the Naismith family was featured in an ESPN &quot;30 for 30&quot; documentary, including fending off a rival bidder who wanted to donate the document to his alma mater Duke University for a similar display at Cameron Indoor Stadium.

On September 24, 2011, an exhibition event called &quot;Legends of the Phog&quot; was held, in which various Kansas Jayhawks Basketball alumni played an exhibition game during the 2011 NBA lockout, including various former players such as Darnell Valentine, Paul Pierce, Nick Collison, Julian Wright, Mario Chalmers, Brandon Rush, Cole Aldrich, Marcus Morris and Markieff Morris. Former Kansas coaches Larry Brown and Ted Owens coached the opposing blue and white teams in front of a sold out crowd. The scrimmage ended with a tie of 111-111, without an overtime, with Chalmers scoring a three-pointer in the final seconds for the white team, which was compared to his famous shot in the 2008 championship game.

==Capacity==
Allen Fieldhouse was built with a capacity of 17,000. During Ted Owens&#x27; coaching period (1964–83), the capacity was reduced to 15,200 to improve fire code-mandated egress routes. It was raised to 15,800 in the 1986 offseason, and to 16,300 in 1993. In 2024, renovations to include corner video boards and additional chair back seats reduced the capacity to 15,300.

There are 4,000 seats dedicated to KU students, with most of the remainder taken by season-ticket-holding members of the Williams Educational Fund, the fundraising arm of KU Athletics, named after Lawrence banker Dick Williams and his sons, Skipper and Odd. The largest crowd in Allen Fieldhouse for a basketball game was 17,228 on March 1, 1955, when the building was dedicated. Barring another expansion of seating, it is unlikely this record will ever be broken; in addition to the reduced capacity, more stringent fire codes have forced KU to strictly enforce the building&#x27;s capacity since the mid-1980s.

==Banners==
In lieu of retiring numbers, banners hang on the south wall of the fieldhouse to honor former men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball players including Wilt Chamberlain, Clyde Lovellette, Jo Jo White, Danny Manning, Paul Pierce, Lynette Woodard, Drew Gooden, Nick Collison, Kirk Hinrich, among others. The banners display the player&#x27;s surname over his/her number, but the numbers themselves are reused. There is also a banner to honor Max Falkenstien, a former Jayhawks radio announcer, who was given the &quot;number&quot; 60 to commemorate his 60 years of service to the university. To date he is the only non-athlete to be so honored at Allen Fieldhouse. The east and west rafters are devoted to KU&#x27;s multiple Final Fours and conference championships.

On the north wall hang banners for KU&#x27;s four national championships: their two championships awarded by the Helms Foundation for KU&#x27;s 1922 and 1923 seasons, as well as their four NCAA tournament titles in 1952, 1988, 2008, and 2022. On the south wall hang banners for the Kansas women&#x27;s basketball team&#x27;s WNIT championship in 2023.

Above these championship banners hangs a banner reading &quot;Pay Heed, All Who Enter: Beware of the Phog&quot;, in reference to the intimidating atmosphere and the team&#x27;s home court dominance. The original &quot;Pay Heed&quot; banner was constructed out of dormitory shower curtains by a group of KU students before a late-season game against the Duke Blue Devils in 1988 and is now on display in the Booth Family Hall of Athletics museum. The slogan was inspired in part by advertisements for the 1980s horror movie The Fog. It hung on the north wall until 1999, by which time it had deteriorated to the point where it was about to fall. The university replaced the banner with a much more regular-looking design, which met with negative reaction from the public. The current banner was redesigned to be more faithful to the look of the original.

A banner reading &quot;Just Load the Wagon&quot; was hung on the west side of Allen Fieldhouse in 2022 to honor the father of Kansas head coach Bill Self after his passing that year. The phrase &quot;just load the wagon&quot; was a common word of encouragement that Self&#x27;s father would say to him throughout his life.

<text>In physics, circulation is the line integral of a vector field around a closed curve embedded in the field. In fluid dynamics, the field is the fluid velocity field. In electrodynamics, it can be the electric or the magnetic field.

In aerodynamics, it finds applications in the calculation of lift, for which circulation was first used independently by Frederick Lanchester,Ludwig Prandtl, Martin Kutta and Nikolay Zhukovsky. It is usually denoted (uppercase gamma).

==Definition and properties==

If is a vector field and is a vector representing the differential length of a small element of a defined curve, the contribution of that differential length to circulation is :
formula_1

Here, is the angle between the vectors and .

The circulation of a vector field around a closed curve is the line integral:
formula_2

In a conservative vector field this integral evaluates to zero for every closed curve. That means that a line integral between any two points in the field is independent of the path taken. It also implies that the vector field can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar function, which is called a potential.

== Relation to vorticity and curl ==

Circulation can be related to curl of a vector field and, more specifically, to vorticity if the field is a fluid velocity field,
formula_3

By Stokes&#x27; theorem, the flux of curl or vorticity vectors through a surface &quot;S&quot; is equal to the circulation around its perimeter,
formula_4

Here, the closed integration path is the boundary or perimeter of an open surface , whose infinitesimal element normal is oriented according to the right-hand rule. Thus curl and vorticity are the circulation per unit area, taken around a local infinitesimal loop.

In potential flow of a fluid with a region of vorticity, all closed curves that enclose the vorticity have the same value for circulation.

== Uses ==

=== Kutta–Joukowski theorem in fluid dynamics ===
In fluid dynamics, the lift per unit span (L&#x27;) acting on a body in a two-dimensional flow field is directly proportional to the circulation, i.e. it can be expressed as the product of the circulation Γ about the body, the fluid density formula_5, and the speed of the body relative to the free-stream formula_6:
formula_7

This is known as the Kutta–Joukowski theorem.

This equation applies around airfoils, where the circulation is generated by &quot;airfoil action&quot;; and around spinning objects experiencing the Magnus effect where the circulation is induced mechanically. In airfoil action, the magnitude of the circulation is determined by the Kutta condition.

The circulation on every closed curve around the airfoil has the same value, and is related to the lift generated by each unit length of span. Provided the closed curve encloses the airfoil, the choice of curve is arbitrary.

Circulation is often used in computational fluid dynamics as an intermediate variable to calculate forces on an airfoil or other body.

=== Fundamental equations of electromagnetism ===
In electrodynamics, the Maxwell-Faraday law of induction can be stated in two equivalent forms: that the curl of the electric field is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic field,
formula_8

or that the circulation of the electric field around a loop is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic field flux through any surface spanned by the loop, by Stokes&#x27; theorem
formula_9

Circulation of a static magnetic field is, by Ampère&#x27;s law, proportional to the total current enclosed by the loop
formula_10

For systems with electric fields that change over time, the law must be modified to include a term known as Maxwell&#x27;s correction.

<text>Kenneth Wayne Jennings III (born May 23, 1974) is an American game show host, former contestant, and author. He is best known for his work on the syndicated quiz show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; as a contestant and later its host. Jennings was born in Seattle, Washington but grew up in South Korea and Singapore. He worked as a computer programmer before he tried out for &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; in 2004. During his initial run, Jennings secured a consecutive 74 wins, setting the record as the highest-earning American game show contestant and bringing significant media attention and viewership.

Afterwards, Jennings pursued a career as an author, writing about his experience and exploring American trivia history and culture in a series of best-selling books. He also appeared on other game shows, including &quot;The Chase&quot;, and hosted the &quot;Omnibus&quot; podcast. He returned to &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; in 2020 as a producer, and later guest-hosted the program after the death of host Alex Trebek the same year. He split full-time hosting duties initially with actress Mayim Bialik until 2023, when he was made the sole host.

Jennings holds numerous game show records: he is the highest-earning American game show contestant, having won money on five different programs, including $4,522,700 on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;. His original appearance on the program marks the longest winning streak, and he also holds the record for the highest average correct responses per game. Additionally, Jennings was awarded the first-place prize in &quot;Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time&quot; (2020).

==Early and personal life==
Kenneth Wayne Jennings III was born on May 23, 1974, in Edmonds, Washington, a suburb of Seattle. His father was an international lawyer and moved the family to South Korea when Ken was in the first grade. His mother was a school teacher and worked for the Department of Defense in that capacity overseas. Jennings grew up viewing &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; on the American Forces Network. Jennings spent 11 years living in Korea and Singapore; he graduated from the Seoul Foreign School.

Upon returning to the United States, Jennings attended the University of Washington. He is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and spent two years as a volunteer missionary, serving in Madrid, Spain. In 1996, he transferred to Brigham Young University (BYU). One of his roommates was author Brandon Sanderson. He also played on the school&#x27;s quizbowl team, at one point serving as captain, and graduated in 2000 with a double major in English and computer science. He met his wife, Mindy, at BYU; they have two children.

After college, Jennings lived in Salt Lake City and was a software engineer for CHG Healthcare Services, a healthcare-placement firm in Holladay, Utah. Following his success on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, Jennings and his family later moved to Seattle, where he splits his time between his career as an author and &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; host. Though &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; tapes in Los Angeles, Jennings said he does not have any plans in the immediate future to relocate there full-time, but he owns a small residence in the city where he stays during taping sessions.

Jennings is a teetotaler.

==&quot;Jeopardy!&quot;==
===Original streak===
Before 2003, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; contestants were limited to five consecutive wins. At the beginning of the show&#x27;s 20th season in 2003, the rules were changed to allow contestants to remain on the show as long as they continued to win. After this rule change, and until Jennings&#x27;s run, the record winning streak was set by Tom Walsh, who won $186,900 in eight games in January 2004. Jennings took the contestant exam for &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; in 2003, but did not hear back from the show for a year. He was given three weeks to prepare for his taping, and he prepared extensively, using a couch as a podium, his young child&#x27;s toy as a buzzer, and having his wife use flash cards and keep score.

Jennings&#x27;s run began during &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; 20th season with the episode aired on June 2, 2004, in which he unseated two-time returning champion Jerry Harvey, and continued into season 21. In that first episode, Jennings&#x27;s entire winning streak nearly ended before it even began. The Final Jeopardy! answer was, &quot;She&#x27;s the first female track and field athlete to win medals in five different events at a single Olympics.&quot; Jennings responded with &quot;Who is Jones?&quot; using only the last name of Marion Jones (who was not stripped of her medals until December 2007). Host Alex Trebek said, &quot;We will accept that, in terms of female athletes, there aren&#x27;t that many.&quot; If the response had not been accepted, Jennings would have finished in third place, and challenger Julia Lazarus would have won the game instead. 

His historic streak then underway, Jennings had taped 48 episodes before a single one made it to air.

His last program was taped in September, but did not air until November 30, 2004, timed to coincide with the end of television sweeps month. On his last show, aired November 30, 2004, his reign as &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; champion ended when he lost his 75th game to challenger Nancy Zerg. Jennings responded incorrectly to both Double Jeopardy! Daily Doubles, causing him to lose a combined $10,200 ($5,400 and $4,800, respectively) and leaving him with $14,400 at the end of the round. As a result, for only the 10th time in 75 games, Jennings did not have an insurmountable lead going into the Final Jeopardy! round. Only Jennings and Zerg, who ended Double Jeopardy! with $10,000, were able to play Final Jeopardy! as third-place contestant David Hankins failed to finish with a positive score after the Double Jeopardy! round. The Final Jeopardy! category was Business &amp; Industry, and the clue was, &quot;Most of this firm&#x27;s 70,000 seasonal white-collar employees work only four months a year.&quot; Jennings appeared perplexed during the time allowed to write a response, while Zerg finished her response quickly. Zerg responded correctly with &quot;What is H&amp;R Block?&quot; and wagered $4,401 of her $10,000, giving her a $1 lead over Jennings with his response still to be revealed. Jennings incorrectly responded with &quot;What is FedEx?&quot; and lost the game with a final score of $8,799 after his $5,601 wager was deducted from his score. After his response was revealed to be incorrect, the audience audibly gasped, and Zerg appeared to be shocked after realizing that she won. Jennings was awarded $2,000 for his second-place finish, which gave him a final total of $2,522,700 for his &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; run. Zerg, whom Jennings called a &quot;formidable opponent&quot;, finished in third place on the next show. The audience gave a standing ovation in honor of both contestants, and Alex Trebek called Zerg a &quot;giant killer&quot; as Jennings embraced her.

Overall, Jennings answered over 2,700 questions correctly on the program. Jennings&#x27;s run was interrupted by the off-season break (July until September), 2004 Kids&#x27; Week, the Tournament of Champions (aired from September 20, 2004, through October 1, 2004), the 2004 United States presidential election (Tuesday, November 2, 2004, when no first-run episode was scheduled; the remaining episodes of the week aired from that Wednesday to Saturday), and the College Championship (aired from November 10, 2004, to November 23, 2004). As a result, he went the entire five months without a loss. Jennings did not participate in the Tournament of Champions, as invitations are extended only to champions (4 wins or more) who have been defeated (with the exception of the winner[s] of the College Championship). On December 1, 2004, the day after his defeat, Jennings made a guest appearance at the start of the broadcast, during which host Alex Trebek acknowledged his success and enumerated the various game show records he had broken.

====Impact and television ratings====
It took a span of 182 calendar days to broadcast Jennings&#x27;s 75 matches. His run on the show brought significant media attention and television ratings. According to the Nielsen TV National People Meter, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; ratings were 22 percent higher during Jennings&#x27;s run than they were during the same period the previous year. For several weeks of the winnings&#x27; streak, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; was ranked as TV&#x27;s highest-rated syndicated program, with ratings 30 percent higher than before his appearance. By the end of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; 20th season several weeks later, the show had surpassed sister program &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; in the ratings, though &quot;Wheel&quot; still benefited from the streak in markets where &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; is its lead-in in the common scheduling tactic for both shows. Jennings was credited with boosting the program&#x27;s popularity as a whole, which at that point had been on the air for two decades but primarily attracted an older demographic.

The attention changed Jennings&#x27;s life overnight, turning him into a household name. Jennings guested on several television programs, including &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, &quot;Nightline&quot;, &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, and the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, where he read the Top Ten List of Ways To Irritate Alex Trebek. Publicists for the program reportedly divided his appearances evenly between ABC and CBS—the former a frequent affiliate for the show and the latter a sister company to the show&#x27;s syndicator. Taking advantage of the notoriety of Jennings&#x27;s losing Final Jeopardy! answer, H&amp;R Block offered Jennings free tax planning and financial services for the rest of his life, with a senior vice president for the company estimating that he owed about $1.04 million in taxes on his winnings. BBDO created an advertisement for FedEx in the &quot;USA Today&quot; newspaper three days after his final game, stating &quot;There&#x27;s only one time FedEx has ever been the wrong answer&quot; and congratulating Jennings for his streak. Barbara Walters named him one of her 10 Most Fascinating People of 2004. In a 2011 Reddit AMA, Jennings recalled how in 2004 the Democratic politicians Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid unsuccessfully asked Jennings to run for the United States Senate from Utah. He commented, &quot;That was when I realized the Democratic Party was [screwed] in &#x27;04&quot;. At the end of the decade, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; put his run on its &quot;best of&quot; list: &quot;Answer: A software engineer from Utah, he dominated the quizfest for a record 74 shows in 2004, amassing $2,520,700. Question: Who is Ken Jennings?&quot;

Jennings donated ten percent of his winnings to the LDS Church. His streak made an impact backstage at the show as well, with the producers implemented some changes during his run. Normally, players only get a short time to practice, but more rehearsal time was added so that the new players could get comfortable with the buzzers. Additionally, the person who managed the buzzer system was changed. In his book &quot;Brainiac&quot;, Jennings says that the consistency of the original manager&#x27;s timing had given an increasing advantage to continuing players, and that the change made a noticeable difference in the second season that he was on the show. At one point, announcer Johnny Gilbert stopped announcing Jennings&#x27;s total wins during the show&#x27;s opening.

His losing episode can be seen on the 2005 DVD release of &quot;Jeopardy!: An Inside Look at America&#x27;s Favorite Quiz Show&quot;. In 2023, Jennings&#x27;s entire run was made available for the first time, streaming on Pluto TV.

===Tournaments===

Jennings returned to the program several times over the years as a contestant in its tournaments. He first rejoined the show for the 15-week, 75-show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; Ultimate Tournament of Champions in 2005. The field totaled 145 players including Jennings, who, unlike the other competitors, was automatically placed in the finals. In the final round, Brad Rutter decisively defeated Jennings and Jerome Vered, with respective final scores of $62,000, $34,599, and $20,600. Jennings won the $500,000 prize for second place, but as a result of the Ultimate Tournament, Rutter temporarily displaced him as the highest overall winner of money on game shows.

He returned for the 2011 &quot;Jeopardy&quot;″s &quot;IBM Challenge&quot;, which featured the company&#x27;s Watson against Jennings and Rutter in two matches played over three days, the first man-versus-machine competition in the show&#x27;s history. The winner of the competition was Watson, winning $1,000,000 for two charities, while Jennings was second and Rutter was third, receiving $300,000 and $200,000, respectively. Jennings and Rutter each pledged to donate half of their winnings to charity. At the end of the first episode, in which only the first match&#x27;s &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; round was aired, Rutter was tied with Watson at $5,000, while Jennings was in third with $2,000. After the second episode in which the first game was completed, Jennings remained at third with $4,800 while Rutter at second had $10,400. The competition ended with Watson with $77,147, Jennings with $24,000, and Rutter with $21,600. Below his response during the Final Jeopardy! round, Jennings wrote on his screen &quot;I for one welcome our new computer overlords.&quot; It was the first time Rutter had been defeated against any human player, although the defeat is not on Rutter&#x27;s &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; official record, as the competition was deemed an exhibition. Jennings wrote about playing against Watson for &quot;Slate&quot;.

He participated in the 2014 &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; Battle of the Decades tournament, where he made it to the finals along with Brad Rutter and Roger Craig. Jennings placed second, winning a $100,000 prize, and Rutter won first place, securing a $1,000,000 prize. In the 2019 &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; All-Star Games, with 18 former champions, Jennings was one of six captains, choosing 2015 Tournament of Champions runner-up Matt Jackson and 2012 &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; College Champion Monica Thieu (who coincidentally eliminated Jennings in a 2016 episode of &quot;500 Questions&quot;) to complete his three-person &quot;Team Ken.&quot; Team Ken finished second to the team captained by Rutter, with Jennings winning $100,000, one-third of the $300,000 second-place prize. In January 2020, ABC aired the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; Greatest of All Time tournament between Jennings, Rutter, and James Holzhauer. Jennings won the championship to be crowned with the &quot;Greatest of All Time&quot; title and a first-place prize of $1,000,000, bringing his lifetime &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;-related winnings to $3,522,700.

===Hosting===

In September 2020, Jennings signed on as a consulting producer of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; for the show&#x27;s 37th season, a job that included reading on-air categories. Alex Trebek, the longtime host of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, had been diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer the previous year. Trebek taped his final episode of the program on October 29, 2020. Contingency plans were made for him to miss the next taping, scheduled for November 9–10, as he planned to have a surgery. Supervising producers Lisa Broffman and Rock Schmidt had named Ken Jennings the interim host for the taping and Jennings had a final conversation with Trebek days before the rehearsal was set to commence. The rehearsal was scheduled for November 8, 2020, but was subsequently cancelled when Schmidt gave the staff the news that Trebek had died that day from his cancer.

Jennings was widely viewed as an heir to the role as host; Trebek had also reportedly considered Jennings his rightful successor. Trebek&#x27;s widow Jean gave Jennings a pair of cufflinks Trebek wore as a gift prior to his first taping as host. Jennings was announced as the first in a series of guest hosts of the program in November 2020. His episodes aired from January 11 to February 19, 2021. Later, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported Jennings was indeed intended to be sole host, but controversy over his remarks on social media hurt his standing, with poor ratings from focus groups and Sony executives fearing his selection could cause backlash.

After a brief period in which presenter Mike Richards was named as host and quickly dismissed due to controversy, Jennings resumed hosting the daily syndicated program alongside actress Mayim Bialik, who had also guest-hosted over 2021. The next year, it was announced that Jennings, along with Bialik, would split hosting duties full-time beginning with the show&#x27;s 39th season. Jennings also began hosting the new &quot;Jeopardy! Masters&quot; series, a primetime tournament featuring six recent notable &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; champions competing against each other in a &quot;Champions League-style&quot; format, on ABC in 2023. The program premiered on May 8, 2023.

Following Bialik&#x27;s withdrawal from &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; on May 11, 2023 due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes, the last 20 episodes of season 39 were hosted by Jennings. Five days later, it was announced that Jennings would host the second season of &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy!&quot;. In September of that year, Jennings received a nomination for Outstanding Host For A Game Show at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards. After the strikes were resolved, Jennings became the permanent sole host of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; starting with the 40th season. According to reporter Claire McNear, &quot;Many &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; staff members came to believe that Jennings had become the technically superior host, according to a source close to production, who says that Jennings&#x27;s improvement was the key factor that spelled the end for Bialik.&quot;

==Writing career==
After his initial success on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, Jennings secured a book deal, and left his career as a programmer to pursue his original love of writing. &quot;Brainiac: Adventures in the Curious, Competitive, Compulsive World of Trivia Buffs&quot; details his experiences on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and his research into trivia culture conducted after the completion of his run, and was published in 2006. &quot;Ken Jennings&#x27; Trivia Almanac: 8,888 Questions in 365 Days&quot;, a hardcover book, is a compilation of trivia questions—with three categories and about 20 questions per day of the year. &quot;Maphead: Charting the Wide, Weird World of Geography Wonks&quot; explores the world of map and geography enthusiasts. &quot;Because I Said So!&quot; is a humorous examination of &quot;the myths, tales &amp; warnings every generation passes down to its kids&quot;. He also has written five books for his children&#x27;s series, &quot;Junior Genius Guides.&quot; 

Jennings has written and edited literature and mythology questions for the National Academic Quiz Tournaments (NAQT), a quiz bowl organization. He has read questions as a moderator at the 2005, 2006, and 2009 NAQT High School National Championship Tournaments in Chicago. Jennings had a weekly trivia column, Ken&quot;nections,&quot; in &quot;Parade&quot; magazine. In it, five questions were posed whose answers were connected to a mystery topic, which the readers had to guess. &quot;Parade&quot; ceased the quiz in early 2015, and removed links to archived quizzes in March 2015. &quot;Kennections&quot; now appears in the online version of &quot;Mental Floss&quot; magazine. Jennings also had a column in &quot;Mental Floss&quot; magazine called &quot;Six Degrees of Ken Jennings&quot;, where readers submitted two wildly different things that Jennings had to connect in exactly six steps, in the style of the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon game. The column ran from November 2005 to the September–October 2010 issue.

Jennings also wrote a trivia newsletter called Trivia Tuesday, which ran from 2006 to 2021. Every Tuesday, beginning on July 4, 2006, Jennings sent out an email containing seven questions. The seventh, a question asking what several items have in common, was designed to be Google-resistant. Subscribers responded with the answers to all seven questions and the results are maintained on a scoreboard on Jennings&#x27;s blog. Every 10 weeks, the respondent with the most seventh questions correct was awarded a signed copy of his newest book. After 800 quizzes, as of November 16, 2021, due to an ever-increasing amount of commitments related to &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, book tours, and simply starting to run out of material for the seventh question, Jennings decided to discontinue the email.

Outside of his writing career, Jennings won the rookie division of the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament in 2006. He was an active member of the trivia app FleetWit, regularly playing in the live trivia races. As of March 2018, on average, he had answered 89 percent of questions correctly and has won over $2,000. He also competed regularly in LearnedLeague under the name &quot;JenningsK&quot;. His last active season was LL85 (May 2020), where he played in the A Rundle of the Laguna league and finished the season in 5th place.

==Other television and game show appearances==

In the aftermath of his &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; fame, Jennings signed with the United Talent Agency, which hoped to expand him into a commercial pitchman or TV host. In 2005 and 2006, he engaged in several endorsements, including a deal with Microsoft to promote its &quot;Encarta&quot; encyclopedia software, and Cingular Wireless (now AT&amp;T) featured Jennings in commercials portraying him as having lots of &quot;friends and family&quot; (coming out of the woodwork once he began winning on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;). He was also involved in speaking deals through the Massachusetts-based speakers&#x27; agency American Program Bureau. University Games produced a &quot;Can You Beat Ken?&quot; board game, in which players vie against each other and Jennings in an attempt to earn $2.6 million first. Each question in the game was asked to Jennings, and his answers, both correct and incorrect, are recorded on the cards.

According to &quot;Variety&quot;, Jennings was slated to host a new game show for Comedy Central set to premiere in 2005 or 2006, but the project later stalled in development. Michael Davies was attached to produce the project. Jennings explained on his website that &quot;Stephen Colbert&#x27;s show was doing so well in its post-&quot;Daily Show&quot; spot that Comedy Central decided they weren&#x27;t in the market for a quiz show anymore.&quot; As of mid-2006, he was still shopping a potential game show titled &quot;Ken Jennings vs. the Rest of the World&quot;. Davies later joined &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; in the 2020s and became its executive producer and showrunner as Jennings assumed the role as host.

In the interim years between his stint as contestant and host of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, Jennings appeared of dozens of other game shows. He taped a pilot for a proposed CBS revival of &quot;Pyramid&quot;, titled &quot;Million Dollar Pyramid&quot;, and was a contestant on other game shows including &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; and &quot;1 vs. 100&quot; in 2006, &quot;Grand Slam&quot; in 2007, &quot;Stump the Master&quot; in 2008–09, &quot;500 Questions&quot; in 2016, and &quot;@midnight&quot; in 2017. His appearance on &quot;Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?&quot; in 2008 held the possibility of exceeding Brad Rutter&#x27;s total game show winnings, had Jennings decided to risk the million dollar question. He also appeared on &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,&quot; as a frequent expert for the lifeline &quot;Ask the Expert&quot;. Jennings appeared on &quot;Millionaire&quot; in 2014 as a contestant during Guinness World Records Edition themed week, where he won $100,000 after deciding to walk away on his $250,000 question. If he had gone for it, Jennings would have been right and would have won $250,000. Jennings was one of eight recurring &quot;Trivia Experts&quot; for &quot;Best Ever Trivia Show&quot;, which debuted in 2019; he was also one of the six trivia experts on &quot;Best Ever&quot; successor, &quot;Master Minds&quot;, from 2020.

In November 2020, it was announced that Jennings would be one of the three chasers on the ABC revival of &quot;The Chase&quot;, hosted by Sara Haines with Rutter and Holzhauer as the other chasers, joined by Mark Labbett in season 2. Jennings left after the second season. In May 2023, he competed against Mayim Bialik and Vanna White on an episode of &quot;Celebrity Wheel of Fortune&quot;, winning $72,800 for the Equal Justice Initiative.

Outside of game shows, Jennings appeared on multiple episodes of &quot;Doug Loves Movies&quot;, hosted by Doug Benson. On September 7, 2017, HowStuffWorks unveiled a new show entitled &quot;Omnibus&quot;, co-hosted by Jennings and John Roderick, frontman of the indie-rock band The Long Winters. They pick topics they fear might be lost to history and discuss them. Jennings also narrated the audiobook version of Alex Trebek&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Answer Is...&quot;. His rendition was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album at the 63rd Grammy Awards.

==Records==
He is the highest-earning American game show contestant, having won money on five different game shows, including $4,522,700 on the American game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;. Jennings holds the record for the longest winning streak on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; with 74 consecutive wins. He also holds the record for the highest average correct responses per game in &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; history (for those contestants with at least 300 correct responses) with 35.9 during his original run (no other contestant has exceeded 30) and 33.1 overall, including tournaments and special events. 

In 2004, Jennings won 74 consecutive &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; games before he was defeated by challenger Nancy Zerg in his 75th appearance. Jennings&#x27;s total earnings on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; are $4,522,700, consisting of: $2,520,700 over his 74 wins; a $2,000 second-place prize in his 75th appearance; a $500,000 second-place prize in the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; Ultimate Tournament of Champions (2005); a $300,000 second-place prize in &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;″s IBM Challenge (2011), when he lost to the Watson computer but became the first person to beat third-place finisher Brad Rutter; a $100,000 second-place prize in the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; Battle of the Decades (2014); a $100,000 second-place prize (his share of his team&#x27;s $300,000 prize) in the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; All-Star Games (2019); and a $1,000,000 first-place prize in &quot;Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time&quot; (2020).

During his first run of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; appearances, Jennings earned the record for the highest American game show winnings. His total was surpassed by Rutter, who defeated Jennings in the finals of the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; Ultimate Tournament of Champions, adding $2 million to Rutter&#x27;s existing &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; winnings. Jennings regained the record after appearances on several other game shows, culminating with his results on an October 2008 appearance on &quot;Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?&quot;, though Rutter retained the record for highest &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; winnings and once again passed Jennings&#x27;s total after his victory in the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; &quot;Battle of the Decades&quot; tournament. In 2020, he once again faced off with and won against Rutter, as well as James Holzhauer, in a special primetime series, &quot;Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time&quot;.

===Recognition===
On March 3, 2020, the Washington State Legislature approved Senate Resolution 8704, congratulating Jennings for his achievements on game shows.

== Controversies ==
=== Controversial tweets ===
Jennings was an active Twitter user, and some of his tweets have been subjects of controversy. On September 22, 2014, Jennings received criticism after tweeting, &quot;Nothing sadder than a hot person in a wheelchair.&quot; The tweet reignited controversy after resurfacing in 2020, which led to condemnation from noted disability rights activists such as Rebecca Cokley.

On November 10, 2015, Jennings was criticized when he tweeted a joke about the death of Daniel Fleetwood, a lifelong &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan who died of cancer. Fleetwood&#x27;s dying wish was to see &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;, fearing he likely would not live to see the film when it opened in theaters in December 2015. An online campaign was started on his behalf and his wish was granted only days before he died. Jennings said, &quot;It can&#x27;t be a good sign that every fan who has seen the new Star Wars movie died shortly thereafter.&quot;

Jennings again faced controversy when on May 31, 2017, he tweeted a joke involving Barron Trump, the youngest child of U.S. President Donald Trump. After 11-year-old Barron saw an image of Kathy Griffin holding a bloody mask modeled after his father, he believed it was real and screamed. Jennings wrote, &quot;Barron Trump saw a very long necktie on a heap of expired deli meat in a dumpster. He thought it was his dad &amp; his little heart is breaking.&quot; After the tweet garnered controversy, Jennings said, &quot;The joke doesn&#x27;t mock Barron. It mocks using him for political cover.&quot;

In August 2018, he was criticized for his description of an elderly woman tweeting about her deceased son. When she tweeted about her son&#x27;s love for the 1980s television character ALF, Jennings responded with &quot;This awful MAGA grandma is my favorite person on Twitter.&quot;

In December 2020, Jennings offered an apology on Twitter for some of his past comments, and subsequently deleted said comments.

In January 2021, Jennings faced controversy again when his friend and podcast co-host John Roderick posted a Twitter thread where he discussed preventing his nine-year-old daughter from eating until she learned to open a can of baked beans using a manual can opener, which he approximated took six hours. The incident caused controversial past tweets to resurface in which Roderick made comments that were seen as using anti-semitic, homophobic, racist, and other derogatory language. Jennings defended Roderick, saying he was &quot;a loving and attentive dad who ... tells heightened-for-effect stories.&quot;

=== 2023 Writers Guild of America strike ===

In May 2023, the Writers Guild of America announced that its unionized writers would go on strike, as part of negotiations largely related to increases in pay, benefits, and protections against artificial intelligence. Jennings&#x27;s then co-host on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, Mayim Bialik, refused to participate in the show&#x27;s final week of filming as a result. Jennings was reportedly brought in as the host for filming &quot;as a result of Bialik&#x27;s decision&quot;; some assumed this meant he had crossed the Writers Guild of America West picket line, but a rep from SAG-AFTRA clarified that since &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; is a Network Television Code show, it was not under the same contract as other shows on strike and therefore Jennings was not crossing the picket line and was clear to work. The show returned for season 40 in late 2023, using a mix of recycled material and newly-written questions made before the strike; the program had also made a similar move during the 2007–08 strike.

<text>Cameron Indoor Stadium is an indoor arena located on the campus of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. The 9,314-seat facility is the primary indoor athletic venue for the Duke Blue Devils and serves as the home court for Duke men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball and women&#x27;s volleyball. It opened in January 1940 and was known as Duke Indoor Stadium until 1972, when it was named for Eddie Cameron, who served at Duke as men&#x27;s basketball coach from 1928 to 1942, as football coach from 1942 to 1945, and as athletic director from 1951 to 1972. The arena is located adjacent to its predecessor, Card Gymnasium, which opened in 1930.

==History==
The plans for the stadium were drawn up in 1935 by basketball coach Eddie Cameron. The stadium was designed by Julian Abele, who studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, France. The same architectural firm that built the Palestra was brought in to build the new stadium. The arena was dedicated on January 6, 1940, having cost $400,000. At the time, it was the largest gymnasium in the country south of the Palestra at the University of Pennsylvania. Originally called &quot;Duke Indoor Stadium&quot;, it was renamed for Cameron on January 22, 1972; that day the Blue Devils beat archrival North Carolina 76–74. The first nationally televised game took place on January 28, 1979, against Marquette; the 69–64 Duke win was broadcast by NBC. Regionally televised games in the Atlantic Coast Conference, including from the (then) Duke Indoor Stadium, had begun in the late 1950s.

The building originally included seating for 8,800, though standing room was sufficient to ensure that 9,500 could fit in on a particularly busy day. Then, as now, Duke students were allocated a large number of the seats, including those in the lower sections directly alongside the court. Renovations in 1987–1988 removed the standing room areas, added an electronic scoreboard and display over center court, wood paneling, brass railings and student seats, bringing capacity to 9,314, though now there is sufficient standing room to ensure 10,000 could fit. For high-profile games, students are known to pack in as many as 1,600 into the student sections, designed for a maximum of 1,100. Prior to the 2002–2003 basketball season, air conditioning units were installed in Cameron for the first time as a response to health and odor concerns for players and fans alike. Prior to the 2008–09 season, a new video scoreboard replaced the electronic board over center court. Before the 2009–10 season, additional changes were made, including installing LED ribbon boards to the front of the press table and painting the upper seats Duke blue. Cameron is one of two major arenas that use backboards suspended from the ceiling instead of anchored on the floor, the other being the CU Events Center in Boulder, Colorado.

== Concerts ==
The Faces performed at Cameron on September 17, 1973.

The Grateful Dead played four shows here between 1973 and 1982 (December 8, 1973; September 23, 1976; April 12, 1978; April 2, 1982).

==Atmosphere==
The students and fans are known as &quot;Cameron Crazies&quot; for their support of the team and loud cheering that has been recorded as high as 121.3 dB, which is louder than a power saw at 3 feet or a jackhammer.

For access to major games, including those against the University of North Carolina, students reside in tents for months in an area outside of Cameron known as &quot;Krzyzewskiville&quot;, named after head coach Mike Krzyzewski. The hardwood floor was dedicated and renamed Coach K Court in November 2000 following a Duke victory over Villanova in the Preseason NIT that was Krzyzewski&#x27;s 500th win as Duke head coach.


==Media coverage==
&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; ranked it fourth on its list of the top 20 sporting venues of the 20th century, and &quot;USA Today&quot; referred to it as &quot;the toughest road game in the ACC.&quot;

==Milestone games==

Additionally, the facility hosted the Southern Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament from 1947 to 1950 and the MEAC men&#x27;s basketball tournament in 1972 and 1973.

==Home court advantage==
Records at Cameron Indoor StadiumAll-Time: 946–171 ()Coach K: 572–76 ()Since 1997–98: 396–37 ()

Duke is 284–30 () at home since the 2004–05 season, second only to Allen Fieldhouse in winning percentage at home.

===Non-conference win streaks===
On November 26, 2019, the Duke men&#x27;s team non-conference home winning streak of 150 games ended with an overtime loss to Stephen F. Austin, 85–83. It had been at that point the longest active non-conference home winning streak in college basketball, with Duke&#x27;s last non-conference home loss coming against St. John&#x27;s almost 19 years earlier on February 26, 2000, when the then #2 Blue Devils lost 83–82.

The streak was the longest non-conference home win streak in Duke men&#x27;s basketball history, breaking the previous record, which lasted 95 games, from February 2, 1983, to December 2, 1995, beginning with a 73–71 win over William &amp; Mary and ending with a 65–75 loss to Illinois.

Duke is now 274–7 in non-conference home games since 1983, starting with the win over William and Mary, having gone 32–3 in home non-conference games between the original and last winning streak. Duke lost to Illinois and St. John&#x27;s during that span, as well as at the hands of Michigan 61–62 on December 8, 1996. Duke also lost to Michigan State and Illinois in 2021.

<doc id="753980" wikidata="Q368192" url="?curid=753980" title="John A. Volpe">
<text>John Anthony Volpe ( ; December 8, 1908November 11, 1994) was an American businessman, diplomat, and politician from Massachusetts. A son of Italian immigrants, he founded and owned a large construction firm. Politically, he was a Republican in increasingly Democratic Massachusetts, serving as its 61st and 63rd Governor from 1961 to 1963 and 1965 to 1969, as the United States Secretary of Transportation from 1969 to 1973, and as the United States Ambassador to Italy from 1973 to 1977. As Secretary of Transportation, Volpe was an important figure in the development of the Interstate Highway System at the federal level.

==Early life and education==
Volpe was born on December 8, 1908, in Wakefield, Massachusetts. He was the son of Italian immigrants Vito and Filomena (née Benedetto) Volpe, who had come from Pescosansonesco, Abruzzo to Boston&#x27;s North End on the SS Canopic in 1905; his father was in the construction business.

Volpe attended the Wentworth Institute (later known as the Wentworth Institute of Technology) in Boston where he majored in architectural construction and entered the construction business, building his own firm in 1930. By the outbreak of World War II, it was one of the USA&#x27;s leading construction companies.

==Personal life==
In 1934, Volpe married Giovannina Benedetto, with whom he had two children, John Anthony, Jr. and Loretta Jean Volpe Rotondi. During World War II, he volunteered to serve stateside as a United States Navy Seabees training officer, enlisting with the rank of lieutenant commander. He was a Knight of Malta and a member of the Knights of Columbus.

== Early political career ==
Volpe&#x27;s first political post was in 1951, when he served as the deputy chair of the Massachusetts Republican Party. In 1953, Governor Christian Herter appointed him the Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Works, and in 1956 he was appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower as the first administrator of the Federal Highway Administration. In this position he oversaw the early phases of the development of the Interstate Highway System.

== Governor of Massachusetts ==
In 1960, Volpe was elected Governor of Massachusetts, defeating Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth Joseph D. Ward. He served as governor from 1961 to 1963. In 1962, Volpe was narrowly defeated for reelection, losing to former Governor&#x27;s Councillor and JFK friend Endicott Peabody. In 1964, Volpe ran again for governor and was able to capitalize on disarray within the Massachusetts Democratic Party when Lieutenant Governor Francis X. Bellotti defeated Peabody for the Democratic nomination for governor. Despite the Democratic landslide nationwide that year, Volpe defeated Bellotti in a close race. In 1966, Volpe was elected to the first four-year term in Massachusetts history, defeating former Massachusetts Attorney General Edward J. McCormack, Jr.

During his administrations, Volpe signed legislation to ban racial imbalances in education, reorganize the state&#x27;s Board of Education, liberalize birth control laws, and increase public housing for low-income families. Governor Volpe also raised revenues, engaging in a long and ultimately successful fight to institute a three percent state sales tax. He served as president of the National Governors Association from 1967 to 1968. In 1962, Volpe signed into law the bill passed by 162nd Massachusetts General Court that established the University of Massachusetts Medical School. On April 22, 1965, Volpe received a visit from Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at the Massachusetts State House, after which King delivered an address to a joint session of the 164th Massachusetts General Court.

On April 1, 1965, a special committee appointed by Massachusetts Education Commissioner Owen Kiernan released its final report finding that more than half of black students enrolled in Boston Public Schools (BPS) attended institutions with enrollments that were at least 80 percent black and that housing segregation in the city had caused the racial imbalance. From its creation under the National Housing Act of 1934 signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Federal Housing Administration used its official mortgage insurance underwriting policy explicitly to prevent school desegregation, while the Boston Housing Authority actively segregated the city&#x27;s public housing developments since at least 1941 and continued to do so despite the passage of legislation by the 156th Massachusetts General Court prohibiting racial discrimination or segregation in housing in 1950 and the issuance of Executive Order 11063 by President John F. Kennedy in 1962 that required all federal agencies to prevent racial discrimination in federally-funded subsidized housing in the United States.

In response to the report, on April 20, 1965, the Boston NAACP filed a lawsuit in federal district court against the city seeking the desegregation of the city&#x27;s public schools. Volpe filed a request for legislation from the state legislature that defined schools with nonwhite enrollments greater than 50 percent to be imbalanced and granted the State Board of Education the power to withhold state funds from any school district in the state that was found to have racial imbalance, which Volpe would sign into law the following August. Also in August 1965, along with Boston Mayor John F. Collins (1960–1968) and BPS Superintendent William H. Ohrenberger, Volpe opposed and warned the Boston School Committee that a vote that they held that month to abandon a proposal to bus several hundred black students from Roxbury and North Dorchester from three overcrowded schools to nearby schools in Dorchester and Brighton, and purchase an abandoned Hebrew school in Dorchester to relieve the overcrowding instead, could now be held by a court to be deliberate acts of segregation. Pursuant to the Racial Imbalance Act, the state conducted a racial census and found 55 imbalanced schools in the state with 46 in Boston, and in October 1965, the State Board required the School Committee to submit a desegregation plan, which the School Committee did the following December.

In April 1966, the State Board found the plan inadequate and voted to rescind state aid to the district, and in response, the School Committee filed a lawsuit against the State Board challenging both the decision and the constitutionality of the Racial Imbalance Act the following August. In January 1967, the Massachusetts Superior Court overturned a Suffolk Superior Court ruling that the State Board had improperly withdrawn the funds and ordered the School Committee to submit an acceptable plan to the State Board within 90 days or else permanently lose funding, which the School Committee did shortly thereafter and the State Board accepted. In June 1967, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld the constitutionality of the Racial Imbalance Act and the U.S. Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren (1953–1969) declined to hear the School Committee&#x27;s appeal in January 1968.

Supportive of civil rights for African-Americans, Volpe saw the discrimination of African-Americans as similar to his own experience with discrimination due to his Italian ancestry.

In 1968, Volpe stood unsuccessfully as a &quot;favorite son&quot; candidate in the Massachusetts Republican presidential primary. Though he was the only person on the ballot, he was defeated by a spontaneous write-in campaign for New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller. Volpe endorsed Richard Nixon. Volpe was one of the finalists in Richard M. Nixon&#x27;s decision concerning a running mate; he was considered acceptable to most wings of the party, but Nixon ultimately selected Spiro Agnew instead.

== Secretary of Transportation ==

Following the election, President Nixon rewarded Volpe for his support by appointing him Secretary of Transportation. He resigned as governor to assume the cabinet post, and served in that position from 1969 to 1973.

During his tenure, Volpe abandoned previous positions supportive of unfettered highway construction, instead pushing for a more balanced approach to the nation&#x27;s transportation infrastructure. He was notably instrumental in effectively ending attempts to revive Boston&#x27;s failed Inner Belt project, which he had promoted as highway administrator. Likewise, Volpe&#x27;s 1969 decision to kill the proposed Riverfront Expressway saved New Orleans&#x27;s historic French Quarter and marked a substantial victory for preservationists, who were able to convince Volpe that an expressway that cut the Quarter off from the riverfront would have been disastrous. Amtrak was established during his time in office. An avid cyclist who biked to work on a folding bike, he used his position - and the energy crisis - to encourage more Americans to bike.

Volpe was the second to serve in this role following the position becoming a Cabinet-level appointment. He received the Award of Excellence in 1970 from &quot;Engineering News-Record&quot; for his service as Secretary of Transportation.

== Ambassador to Italy ==
Volpe had a long and abiding interest in the homeland of his parents, and visited it many times. In 1969, he was awarded the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.

In 1973, Volpe was nominated by President Nixon and confirmed by the United States Senate as United States Ambassador to Italy, a position he held until 1977. Volpe was snubbed by elements of the Italian elite/political establishment, due to his roots in southern Italy, and he upset leftist elements by making strong statements against the inclusion of the Italian Communist Party in its government. He was accused by the Italian Communist press of being &quot;neo-Fascist&quot; for his views.

== Death and legacy ==
Volpe died in Nahant, Massachusetts, on November 11, 1994, at the age of 85. He was buried at Forest Glade Cemetery in Wakefield, Massachusetts.

The John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center in Cambridge was named in his memory, as well as the Governor John A. Volpe Library at Wakefield High School in Wakefield. Volpe&#x27;s papers are stored in the Archives and Special Collections of the Northeastern University Libraries, in Boston. Terminal E at Logan International Airport is also dedicated in his honor.

<doc id="753992" wikidata="Q1126193" url="?curid=753992" title="Pauley Pavilion">
<text>Edwin W. Pauley Pavilion, commonly known as Pauley Pavilion, is an indoor arena located in the Westwood Village district of Los Angeles, California, on the campus of UCLA. It is home to the UCLA Bruins men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s volleyball and women&#x27;s gymnastics teams also compete here. All teams compete in the Big Ten Conference.

The building, designed by architect Welton Becket, was dedicated in June 1965, named for University of California Regent Edwin W. Pauley, who had matched the alumni contributions. Pauley donated almost one fifth of the more than $5 million spent in constructing the arena. The arena was renovated in 2010–12 and was reopened on November 9, 2012, when it hosted a men&#x27;s basketball game against Indiana State.

==Features==
Pauley Pavilion contains 11,307 permanent theater-style upholstered seats, plus retractable seats for 2,492 spectators (466 seats without backs used by the band and students), making a total basketball capacity of 13,800. The capacity prior to the renovation (12,829) had been exceeded several times for several men&#x27;s basketball games by adding portable seating alongside the retractable seats. The Bruins reopened the newly renovated Pauley Pavilion on November 9, 2012, in front of a record crowd of 13,513. Then a new record was set when 13,727 fans watched the Bruins defeat the Arizona Wildcats 74–69 on March 2, 2013.

When the floor seats are retracted, there is space for three full-sized basketball courts. These courts are used for team practice, intramural games, and pickup basketball games. It can also serve as a convention hall or large dining area when in this configuration.

When used for men&#x27;s volleyball, the basketball court is striped with colored tape. The volleyball net is erected at the half court line. The women&#x27;s team uses blue and yellow Sport Court lined up perpendicularly to the basketball court tucked up to the east end of the court.

There is a tunnel on the south side through which trucks and service vehicles may enter. This is also the &quot;backstage&quot; entrance for players, performers, and broadcast personnel.

The floor is called &quot;Nell and John Wooden Court&quot; in honor of former UCLA Men&#x27;s Basketball Coach John Wooden and his wife Nell.

==UCLA Men&#x27;s Basketball seating==
From the opening of the building until 1987, the extra press not involved in the radio or television broadcasts sat behind the south side (team bench side) press table. The working press then moved to sit courtside at &quot;press row&quot; on the northern side of the court, as the south courtside seats were opened up to influential and affluent boosters. In 2003, the UCLA Athletic Department made available north side courtside seats to affluent donors. The media now sit higher up in permanent seating dead-center in the north side of the bleachers. The press move to the north side in 1987 was as controversial as the 2003 move, in that the student section was now behind the press table and big donors had taken the south side courtside seats.

The student section has moved several times as well. Since 2014, the student section occupies the 100 level south side seats, as well as the west corner with overflow in the 200 level.

The UCLA Varsity Band has also moved to accommodate seating changes. Originally, they were located on the north courtside directly across from the UCLA bench. In 1984, they moved to the northeast corner courtside. In 1990 they moved to the north courtside directly across from the visitors bench. In 1996 they moved to the north side above the student section. In 2003, they moved to the west side of the arena to be courtside.

==History==

===1960s===

Before the construction of the Pavilion, the on-campus home to the UCLA Bruins men&#x27;s basketball team was the 2,400-seat Men&#x27;s Gym, currently known as the Student Activities Center, but then disparagingly known as the &quot;B. O. barn.&quot; After John Wooden led the Bruins to the national championship in 1964, fans and Wooden felt that a more suitable arena needed to be constructed. However, it had been obvious even before then that the Bruins needed a new arena; since 1955 the Men&#x27;s Gym&#x27;s capacity had been limited to 1,500 by order of the Los Angeles fire marshal. Games that were expected to attract larger crowds were played at Pan Pacific Auditorium, the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena and other venues around Los Angeles.

Pauley Pavilion was constructed so that there would be some space between the crowds and the action on the court. Wooden cited the example of the close quarters of Cal&#x27;s Harmon Gym (now Haas Pavilion) where fans would &quot;pull leg hairs from his players&#x27; legs&quot;. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, then known as Lew Alcindor, was recruited to UCLA partly on the promise of playing in the new arena.

*H.R. Haldeman (Chief of Staff of Nixon White House 1969–1973) headed the campaign to build a state-of-the-art sports arena. A million dollars was raised, which was matched by a donation from Edwin W. Pauley, who was a member of the Board of Regents of the University of California.
*The building was dedicated to Regent Edwin W. Pauley, at the June 1965 commencement ceremony by UCLA Chancellor Franklin D. Murphy.
*The facility opened for the 1965–1966 college basketball season. The first game ever played in Pauley Pavilion was on November 27, 1965. It featured the freshmen team, led by Lew Alcindor, against the UCLA varsity squad, the two-time defending champions and pre-season No. 1 team. The freshmen, led by Alcindor&#x27;s 31 points and 21 rebounds, defeated the varsity team 75–60, a surprise considering the varsity squad had been chosen to finish number one in the nation in the preseason.
*Ohio State was the first visiting team in the regular season. The varsity Bruins defeated the Buckeyes in the inaugural game 92–66.
*Pauley Pavilion hosted its first NCAA Regional Finals in the 1969 post-season. The Bruins advanced from there to win the 1969 Championship.

===1970s===
*John Wooden coached what would be his final game as varsity head coach in Pauley Pavilion March 1, 1975 in a 93–59 victory over Stanford. Four weeks later he would surprisingly announce his retirement following the NCAA semi-final victory against Louisville and before his 10th National championship victory against Kentucky. The Bruins won 150 games to 3 losses at home between 1965 and 1975, losing only to Cincinnati in 1965, Oregon in 1966, and Southern California in 1970. Bruin men&#x27;s basketball teams won 8 more NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championships from 1967 through 1975 under Coach Wooden.
*UCLA&#x27;s longest winning streak in men&#x27;s basketball at Pauley Pavilion was 98 games. It ended on February 21, 1976, when Oregon defeated UCLA, 65–45.
*The 1978 AIAW Women&#x27;s Basketball Championship Final Four was hosted at Pauley Pavilion. UCLA defeated the University of Maryland, College Park 90–74 to win their first Women&#x27;s basketball championship in front of a crowd of 9,531.
*The Grateful Dead performed here on November 20, 1971, November 17, 1973, December 30, 1978, and November 25, 1979.

===1980s===

*The first NCAA Women&#x27;s Volleyball Championship was held at Pauley Pavilion in 1981, with UCLA falling to USC in the title match.
*The building was host to the 1984 NCAA Women&#x27;s Division I Basketball Tournament. It was the third championship since the NCAA championship took precedence over the AIAW championship. The USC Trojan women&#x27;s basketball team defeated the University of Tennessee Lady Vols 72–61.
*The building was the venue for gymnastics for the 1984 Summer Olympic Games.
*In the 1985 post-season, the Bruins hosted their first National Invitation Tournament (NIT) tournament games under coach Walt Hazzard. The Bruins won all three and advanced to the finals to win the 1985 National Invitation Tournament. In November 1985 at the intrasquad game, a banner was added in a ceremony commemorating the tournament championship. The banner was the same design as the NCAA championship banners, but slightly smaller. This banner subsequently was removed to make room for the 1995 National Championship banner.
*The 1987 Pacific-10 Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament, the first Pacific-10 Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament, was played in Pauley Pavilion in the 1987 post-season. The Bruins were the first tournament champions.
*The 1987 NCAA Men&#x27;s Volleyball Championship was held in Pauley Pavilion. UCLA defeated USC 3–0 to win the title.
*On June 28, 1987, John Wooden and Dean Smith coached against each other in an exhibition basketball game featuring alumni from both schools. The North Carolina team defeated the UCLA team 116–111.
*In the 1989–1990 season, the building was celebrated in &quot;25 years of Pauley&quot;. A book, &quot;Pauley Pavilion: College Basketball&#x27;s Showplace&quot; by David Smale, was released commemorating the great teams that played there as well as great moments in the history of the building. The first jersey numbers of outstanding players were retired and displayed in the building (see below).
*The Grateful Dead performed here on June 29, 1980, and February 21, 1982.

===1990s===

*The venue played host to the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards.
*UCLA&#x27;s 75th anniversary convocation on May 20, 1994: &quot;I&#x27;m proud to be here to honor the university&#x27;s 75th anniversary, and to honor your chancellor on his 25th anniversary of service,&quot; President Bill Clinton told the crowd of more than 9,000. &quot;It is the sort of commitment our country could do with more of, and I honor it.&quot;
*In 1995 the Bruins won their eleventh NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship, this time under coach Jim Harrick.
*On October 14, 1995, the first day of practice after UCLA won its eleventh national championship in basketball, the UCLA Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Basketball teams held UCLA&#x27;s first - and heretofore only - Midnight Madness ceremony. (In NCAA rules before the 2005 season, practices could not begin until midnight of the first day. Many schools would use this as an opportunity to build support for their teams by beginning the season publicly at the first possible minute.)

===2000s===
*Former UCLA coach John Wooden and his late wife were honored on December 20, 2003, when the basketball floor at Pauley Pavilion was named &quot;Nell &amp; John Wooden Court.&quot; After his retirement, Coach Wooden was a fixture at UCLA Men&#x27;s Basketball games until the year he died.
*The pavilion has played host to the numerous annual Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, including the 21st show on March 29, 2008, with UCLA alum Jack Black as host. The ceremony moved to USC&#x27;s Galen Center arena after the 2011 renovations.
*The 2001 &quot;Jeopardy! College Championship&quot; was taped at Pauley Pavilion (November 7–20, 2001). Vinita Kailasanath (Stanford University) was the winner. Jayce Newton represented UCLA.
*The Who were honored at the 2008 VH1 Rock Honors ceremony at the Pauley Pavilion instead of the usual Las Vegas. The concert consisted of an hour-long performance by the band as well as tributes by Incubus, Pearl Jam, Foo Fighters, Flaming Lips, Adam Sandler and Tenacious D.
*Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign held a rally at Pauley Pavilion on February 3, 2008, the Sunday before California&#x27;s presidential primary election. The event featured speeches by Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey, Caroline Kennedy, Stevie Wonder, and California First Lady Maria Shriver.
* Game one of the WNBA Conference finals between Phoenix Mercury and Los Angeles Sparks, September 23, 2009.
* Jay-Z concert with Rihanna, on November 8, 2009. Enjoying their performances were Justin Timberlake, Jessica Biel, Nicole Richie, Samantha Ronson, James Blunt, and Jamie Foxx.

===2010s===

* An eight-foot high bronze statue of Coach John Wooden by sculptor Blair Buswell was dedicated at the newly renovated arena on October 26, 2012. A men&#x27;s basketball game against Indiana State on Friday, Nov. 9, 2012 was the first game at the new facility. The game honors Wooden&#x27;s coaching career at both schools
* First non-athletics event after renovations, the LA Tennis Challenge was held on March 4, 2013, featuring the singles match of Tommy Haas vs. James Blake; and Novak Djokovic vs. Mardy Fish; and doubles match of Djokovic and Pete Sampras vs. Bob and Mike Bryan.
* The original center jump circle, used from the 1965 opening until 1982, was owned by a private collector. It was sold at auction for $325,000 in April 2013. It was reported as the highest paid amount for college basketball memorabilia at the time.
* Host site for first and second round of the 2014, 2016, 2017 NCAA women&#x27;s basketball tournament
* Venue for Nickelodeon&#x27;s annual Kids&#x27; Choice Sports.

===2020s===

* 2022 NCAA Men&#x27;s National Collegiate Volleyball Tournament, May 1–7, 2022
* 2024 NCAA Division I women&#x27;s basketball tournament first and second rounds, March 23 and 25, 2024

== Kids&#x27; Choice Awards and Kids&#x27; Choice Sports ==
The venue has been used for the Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards. It first held the KCAs in 1995, then in 1998 and 1999, then from 2004 to 2010. When renovations began in 2011, the show was moved to the Galen Center. From 2014 to 2017, it became the venue for the Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Sports, a spin-off to the Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards. The KCSs then moved to Barker Hangar for 2018 and 2019.

==UCLA championship banners==

The only championship banners that are currently displayed within the building are for national or NCAA Championships. Unlike most schools, there are neither conference championship banners nor other tournament championship banners displayed in the building, despite the fact UCLA teams have won many tournaments and basketball championships in the Pac-12 Conference and its predecessor conferences. Former Bruin point guard, New Jersey Nets, LA native and former Los Angeles Lakers player Jordan Farmar described the rationale for this during the Bruins&#x27; 2005 Final Four run, by stating, &quot;[a]t UCLA, only national championship banners go up.&quot; The men&#x27;s banners are blue with gold lettering, while the women&#x27;s banners are gold with blue lettering.

In 1985 UCLA won the NIT and promptly hung an NIT championship banner among the 10 existing NCAA championship banners. This banner remained in the rafters until 1995, when the Bruins won the NCAA title again and replaced the NIT banner with their 11th NCAA championship banner. During the 2012 renovation, replicas were created for some of the older banners, which were different sizes. The original banners were then sold at an auction.

There is one banner for the women&#x27;s basketball AIAW championship in 1978. There are 11 individual banners for the NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship teams. There are two banners for volleyball, one for the 19 men&#x27;s NCAA volleyball championships and one for the three NCAA women&#x27;s volleyball championships and three AIAW championships. There are two banners for gymnastics, one for the two men&#x27;s NCAA gymnastics champions and one for the five NCAA women&#x27;s gymnastics champions. The volleyball and gymnastics banners list all the years in which Bruin teams were NCAA or National champions.

==Retired numbers==

The retired numbers of UCLA men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball players are displayed in the rafters of Pauley Pavilion. On February 3, 1990, the first four UCLA basketball player jersey numbers were retired. This was the key moment in the &quot;Pauley at 25&quot; celebration of the first 25 years of the arena. The primary criteria for being chosen was that all four players were three-time All-Americans.
The initial honorees were:
*Ann Meyers #15
*Denise Curry #12
*Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (played under his original name of Lew Alcindor) #33
*Bill Walton #32
==Significant events==
Pauley Pavilion has been the venue for many other sports championships, concerts, commencement ceremonies and political events.

Concert performers have included Bob Marley, Bad Religion, Bob Dylan, Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Luciano Pavarotti, Eric Clapton, The Grateful Dead, Phish, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Metallica, and Faith No More, among others.

In 1970, Frank Zappa appeared with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra performing Zappa&#x27;s orchestral music. Zubin Mehta directed the orchestra in what would become the soundtrack for Zappa&#x27;s movie 200 Motels. Frank Zappa &amp; the Mothers of Invention recorded &quot;Just Another Band from L.A.&quot; at the Pauley Pavilion in 1971, and was released in 1972.

In 1984, it was the Los Angeles venue for the 1984 Summer Olympics Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s gymnastics and Women&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics events. Mary Lou Retton became the first Olympic gymnast outside of Eastern Europe ever to have won the Olympic all-around title.

On April 26, 1986, a birthday tribute for actress/comedian Carol Burnett was held inside. Singer Neil Diamond performed &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; in her honor.

Two years later in 1988, it was the site of a presidential election debate between George H. W. Bush and Michael Dukakis. Dukakis also held his final election-eve rally here, hosted by the UCLA Bruin Democrats.

In 1994, composer Henry Mancini, having learned he had terminal cancer, gave his last concert at Pauley Pavilion.

In 2009, UCLA Spring Sing made its Pauley Pavilion return on May 8, having switched from the smaller Los Angeles Tennis Center to this much larger venue due to its popularity and overwhelming demand.

On February 26, 2011, the Bruins hosted their last men&#x27;s basketball home game against the Arizona Wildcats before extensive renovations were scheduled to begin. Tyler Trapani, great grandson of Coach John Wooden and member of UCLA&#x27;s team, fittingly scored the last goal in the old arena. The 1971 National Champions were honored at halftime.

In 1982, the center court jump circle was replaced. It was later autographed by coach John Wooden and several former Bruins&#x27; players including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Walton. It was acquired by a private party and consigned to a sports memorabilia auction where it sold May 1, 2011 for $325,085, the most ever paid for a piece of college basketball memorabilia.

Almost every year since its inception, the Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards were held inside the arena until the renovations in 2011. It was replaced by Kids Choice Sports Awards in 2014 and been held since then.

Following the completion of the renovation, Pauley Pavilion hosted the NCAA women&#x27;s gymnastics championships on April 19–21, 2013 and the NCAA men&#x27;s volleyball championships on May 2 &amp; 4, 2013.

In recent years, the newly renovated Pauley Pavilion has hosted many campus-wide events. In 2013, UCLA&#x27;s annual Spring Sing organized by the Student Alumni Association was held in this arena. Bruins from all areas of campus performed on stage and truly exemplified the talent and spirit of the UCLA community. The Pediatric Aids Coalition hosts their 26-hour Dance Marathon in Pauley Pavilion as well, which raised $445,019.18 for Pediatric AIDS research in 2014, $446,157.05 in 2015, and $446,253.60 in 2016.

The court was significantly flooded after a 30-inch water main burst on Sunset Boulevard and water started spewing in on July 29, 2014.

On May 1–5, 2018, Pauley Pavilion was the host for the 2018 NCAA Men&#x27;s National Collegiate Volleyball Tournament. Long Beach State defeated the Bruins in 5 sets to win its second national title since 1991.

Both the 2022 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Volleyball Tournament and the 2022 NCAA Men&#x27;s National Collegiate Volleyball Tournament will be held at Pauley Pavilion on April 20–23, 2022 and May 1–7, 2022 respectively.

==Renovation==

As Pauley Pavilion was turning 40 years old, talk intensified about a possible major renovation of the facility. Narrowness of the concourses for spectators to walk around the arena, limited food services and restrooms, the lack of luxury boxes, and a floor configuration that keeps some seating sections distant from the floor have been cited by various observers as areas needing improvement.

According to a 2008 article in the UCLA &quot;Daily Bruin&quot;, &quot;UCLA initially announced the project Jan. 11, 2007, when it hoped to have construction completed by legendary basketball coach John Wooden’s 100th birthday, Oct. 14, 2010. Since that announcement, the project has moved slowly, as UCLA has sought to raise funds for the project.&quot;

The cost of the renovation was once estimated to be $110 million, but now a final estimate will await the development of the architectural plans. The Daily Bruin article also noted &quot;a 2012 completion date is now most likely,&quot; with UCLA basketball games having to move off-campus for one year. Exterior work began in 2010, with interior construction following the 2010-2011 basketball season.

The university unveiled the Pauley Pavilion renovation plans to the public and kicked off the fund-raising campaign on May 11, 2009, at Pauley. The groundbreaking ceremony was held a year later on May 11, 2010. By that time, Wooden was in failing health and could not attend; he died three weeks later, at age 99.

The last men&#x27;s basketball game before Pauley was closed for renovation was UCLA&#x27;s 71–49 victory over Arizona. The last basket of that game was scored by the Bruins&#x27; Tyler Trapani, Coach John Wooden&#x27;s great-grandson.
Controversy emerged due to the newly announced location of the student &quot;den&quot; section. The student section would have been moved from the traditional courtside seats to an area behind the basket. However, after action by alumni and an on-campus student vote, the proposed change was reverted.

After Pauley&#x27;s closure for renovation, the 2011-12 Bruins men&#x27;s basketball team played their home games off-campus at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena and the Honda Center. Women&#x27;s basketball and other Pauley Pavilion teams played at the on-campus John Wooden Center.

Pauley Pavilion was renovated and opened for the UCLA men&#x27;s basketball season in 2012.

<text>Sidney Spence Culbert (May 14, 1913 – October 28, 2003) was a linguist, psychologist and Esperantist.

==Biography==
Born in Miles City, Montana, Culbert moved to Tacoma, Washington with his family in 1923 and lived in Tacoma and Seattle for most of his life.

He extensively researched the number of speakers of various languages throughout the world (by stratified sampling), and contributed to the &quot;World Almanac&quot;&#x27;s section on &quot;Principal Languages of the World&quot;. An Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Washington (Seattle) for most of his academic career, in addition to his research into the speaking populations of languages he made significant contributions to the study of perception, contributions that were influential in the design of cockpit instrument panels in the Boeing 707 jet aircraft. Prior to receiving his doctorate and accepting a professorial position, Culbert had worked for a number of years as an engineer with the Boeing Company. During his tenure at the University of Washington he was actively involved in establishing the university&#x27;s Linguistics Department, but chose to remain in the Psychology Department because his main linguistic focus, involving issues of perception, was in the field of psycholinguistics, which was then seen as more a matter of psychology than of language.

He died on October 28, 2003.

<doc id="753999" wikidata="Q3490582" url="?curid=753999" title="Murder of Kristen French">
<text>The murder of Kristen French was a high-profile Canadian kidnapping and murder case which occurred in St. Catharines, Ontario. French, a 15-year-old schoolgirl was abducted by serial killers Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka on April 16, 1992. French was tortured, raped and finally murdered on April 19, 1992. Her naked body was found in Burlington on April 30, 1992. 

French&#x27;s murder and kidnapping was the third and final case of the &quot;Schoolgirl Killer murders.&quot;, including Tammy Homolka and Leslie Mahaffy. Bernardo was convicted for two first-degree murders and two aggravated sexual assaults, and sentenced to life in prison without parole and Homolka was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment. 

The murder of Kristen French was widely covered by the national media, becoming one of the most notorious cases of Canada. 

==Biography==
Kristen Dawn French (May 10, 1976 – April 19, 1992) was a 15-year-old girl from St. Catharines, Ontario. She was the second daughter of Doug and Donna French. Her brother in law is a retired journalism instructor at Cambrian College.

She was a member of a precision ice-skating team which won several medals, and a member of the girls&#x27; rowing team at Holy Cross Catholic Secondary School.

==Crime==

=== Abduction ===
On April 16, 1992, French was walking home from Holy Cross Secondary School. French was approached at the entrance of the Grace Lutheran Church parking lot by serial killers Karla Homolka and Paul Bernardo. Homolka got out of the car carrying a map, pretending to need assistance. When French was assisting Homolka with directions, Bernardo snuck up on her from behind and forced her into the car at knifepoint. While French was seated in the front seat, Homolka held down French&#x27;s hair in order to keep the abductee in check. The kidnapping was seen by several eyewitnesses. 

When French did not come home, her parents reported her disappearance to the police. French&#x27;s shoe was recovered from the parking lot.

=== Murder ===
The medical examiner&#x27;s report state she was held in captivity for three days, during which Bernardo and Homolka videotaped themselves torturing and subjecting the 15-year-old to sexual humiliation and degradation while forcing her to drink large amounts of alcohol. 

French is remembered for declining cooperation with her abductors in the latter period of her abduction: &quot;Some things are worth dying for&quot;. She said to Bernardo: &quot;I don&#x27;t know how your wife can stand being around you.&quot;

French was murdered on April 19, 1992; her naked body was found on April 30, 1992, in a ditch along No. 1 Sideroad in Burlington, about forty-five minutes from St. Catharines. Her body was found washed and her hair was cut off, Homolka testified that it was cut to impede identification. Pathologist Dr. Noel McAuliffe concluded that French was killed by strangulation.

== Conviction ==
On September 1, 1995, Bernardo was convicted of a number of offences, including the two first-degree murders and two aggravated sexual assaults of French and Leslie Mahaffy. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a possibility of parole after 25 years. On July 6, 1993, Homolka was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.

== Reactions ==
While French was missing, her classmates, teachers and friends at Holy Cross Secondary School chose the Green Ribbon of Hope as the symbol for their search. French&#x27;s school community also gave the name to the Green Ribbon of Hope Campaign, a national campaign continued by Child Find Canada, governments, organizations and individuals to raise funds and awareness for missing children.

The Green Ribbon Trail in St. Catharines was named in her honour, and a monument to French&#x27;s memory stands at the beginning of the trail. The ribbon also gave its name to the Green Ribbon Task Force, the police group tasked with finding Leslie Mahaffy and French&#x27;s killers, though they later found themselves embroiled in controversy over the role of media in police investigations.

<text>Ronald W. Hughes (March 16, 1935 – November 1970) was an American attorney who represented Leslie Van Houten, a member of the Manson Family. Hughes disappeared while on a camping trip during a ten-day recess from the Tate-LaBianca murder trial in November 1970. His body was found in March 1971, but his cause of death could not be determined. At least one Manson Family member has claimed that Hughes was murdered by the family in an act of retaliation. No one has been charged in connection with his death.

== Tate–LaBianca murder trial ==

Ronald Hughes was among the first lawyers to meet with Charles Manson in December 1969. Initially he signed on as the attorney for Manson, but was replaced by Irving Kanarek two weeks before the start of the trial.

Hughes eventually represented Leslie Van Houten in the Tate–LaBianca murder trial. He had failed the bar exam three times before passing and had never tried a case. Hughes, a onetime conservative, was called &quot;the hippie lawyer&quot; due to his intimate knowledge of the hippie subculture. That knowledge occasionally served his client well; he was able to raise questions about Linda Kasabian&#x27;s credibility by asking her about hallucinogenic drugs, her belief in ESP, her thoughts that she might be a witch and her experiencing &quot;vibrations&quot; from Manson.

As attorney for defendant Van Houten, Hughes tried to separate the interests of his client from those of Manson, a move that angered Manson and may have cost Hughes his life. He hoped to show that Van Houten was not acting independently, but was completely controlled in her actions by Manson. This strategy contradicted Manson&#x27;s plan to allow fellow family members to implicate themselves in the crimes, clearing him of all involvement.

Twenty-two weeks into the trial, which included outbursts and bizarre behavior from Manson and his co-defendants, the prosecution rested. Lawyers for the defendants stunned the courtroom by announcing that the defense also rested. Van Houten, Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkel immediately shouted that they wanted to testify. Per Manson&#x27;s instructions, the women said that they wanted to testify to committing the murders on their own and that Manson had nothing to do with the crimes. Hughes objected and stood up against Manson&#x27;s ploy, stating, &quot;I refuse to take part in any proceeding where I am forced to push a client out the window.&quot; After Manson made a statement to the court, however, Hughes then told the women that they no longer had to testify. Judge Charles Older then ordered a ten-day recess to allow the attorneys to prepare for their final arguments. Hughes later told a reporter that he was confident that he could secure an acquittal for Van Houten.

==Disappearance==
On November 27, 1970, Hughes decided to take a camping trip in a remote area near Sespe Hot Springs in Ventura County, California. According to James Forsher and Lauren Elder, two friends who accompanied Hughes on the trip, heavy rains which had caused flash floods in the area had mired their Volkswagen in mud. Forsher and Elder hitchhiked their way out, while Hughes decided to stay in the area until November 29. As the rains continued, the wilderness area was evacuated. Hughes was last seen by three campers on the morning of November 28. They later told investigators that Hughes was alone at the time and had briefly stopped to talk with them. Hughes also appeared to be unharmed and was in an area that was away from flood waters. When court reconvened on November 30, Hughes failed to appear. Due to continued rainstorms, the Ventura County sheriff had to wait two days before a search was launched.

On December 2, Judge Older ordered the trial to proceed and appointed a new attorney, Maxwell Keith, for Van Houten. The women angrily demanded the firing of all their lawyers, and asked to reopen the defense. Judge Older denied the request. By week&#x27;s end, Hughes had been missing for two weeks. When the court reconvened, Manson and the women created a disturbance suggesting that Judge Older &quot;did away with Ronald Hughes,&quot; which resulted in their being removed again from the courtroom.

==Death==
Over the following months, police conducted more than a dozen searches of the area where Hughes was last seen. After receiving an anonymous tip in March 1971, police also searched in the area surrounding the Barker Ranch in Inyo County where Manson and his associates had previously lived.

On March 29, 1971, the same day the jury returned death penalty verdicts against all the defendants on all counts, Hughes&#x27; severely decomposed body was discovered by two fishermen in Ventura County. His body was found wedged between two boulders in a gorge. Hughes was later positively identified by dental X-rays. Due to the severe decomposition of his body, the cause and nature of his death was ruled as &#x27;Undetermined&#x27;.

Hughes&#x27; funeral was held on April 7, 1971 in West Los Angeles. He was buried in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

==Aftermath==
In his book &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, Vincent Bugliosi wrote that Sandra Good, an associate of Manson and a close friend of devoted Manson family member Lynette &quot;Squeaky&quot; Fromme, claimed that Manson family members had killed &quot;35 to 40 people&quot; and that, &quot;Hughes was the first of the retaliation murders.&quot; In the afterword to the 25th anniversary edition of the book, Bugliosi also said that he received a call in 1976 from a former member of the Manson family, &quot;understandably wanting to remain anonymous,&quot; who also claimed that Hughes had been murdered by the family. Attorney Stephen Kay, who helped Bugliosi prosecute members of the family, stated that while he is &quot;on the fence&quot; about the family&#x27;s involvement in Hughes&#x27; death, Manson had open contempt for Hughes during the trial. Kay added, &quot;The last thing Manson said to him [Hughes] was, &#x27;I don&#x27;t want to see you in the courtroom again,&#x27; and he was never seen again alive.&quot;

Retired Ventura County sheriff Charlie Rudd, who was assigned to investigate Hughes&#x27; disappearance, stated that he felt Hughes&#x27; death was accidental because there were no signs of foul play. Rudd believes that Hughes was stranded by the rainstorm which caused the creek to swell. He believes that Hughes drowned or was knocked unconscious and killed by rocks and debris as he was swept away by the water. Musician and author Ed Sanders, who was a friend of Hughes, wrote about his death in his 1971 book &quot;The Family&quot;. He stated therein that his death was due to accidental drowning.

In 1976, Van Houten was granted a new trial on the grounds that she was denied proper legal representation after Hughes disappeared before the closing arguments. Her retrial in 1977 ended in a hung jury. She was released from jail after posting $200,000 bond and retried in 1978. In her third trial, Van Houten was convicted of the first-degree murders of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca and conspiracy in connection with the Tate murders. She was sentenced to seven years to life in prison.

<text>Góra Kalwaria (; &quot;Calvary Mountain&quot;, , &quot;Ger&quot;) is a town on the Vistula River in the Masovian Voivodeship, in east-central Poland. It is situated approximately southeast of Warsaw. It has a population of around 11,328 (as of 2019) and a total area of 13.7 km2.

The town was first mentioned in 1252, and was re-founded as Nowa Jerozolima in 1670. It obtained its Magdeburg rights thanks to John III Sobieski. It was modeled after the city of Jerusalem, and was intended as a centre for strengthening Catholicism. It became the seat of famous tzadiks such as Avraham Mordechai Alter or Yitzchak Meir Alter.

Hasidic Judaism appeared in Góra Kalwaria in 1859. The town was an important centre of the Hasidic movement. Before World War II, there were 3,000 Jews in the town. However, after the transports to the Warsaw Ghetto, the town ultimately ended up with only 2 Jews as of 2007, who are likely dead by now.

In World War I, the town was devastated by both sides of the war. Many were deprived of their possessions, houses were plundered and many other buildings such as shops were destroyed. However, the town regained its city rights in 1916 which it had previously lost to the Russians.

In World War II, a battle occurred here. It ended with a Polish defeat as they were outnumbered and could not count on support due to no radio communication with the command. The town supplied the Nazi-occupied capital with lots of flour, bread, and meat.

The town is now governed by Arkadiusz Strzyżewski. The main road of the town is Pijarska, and the town is laid out in the shape of a Latin cross. Notable landmarks include the Bernadine church and monastery, the church known as &quot;Pilate&#x27;s Chapel&quot;, the Church of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Chapel of St. Anthony. Part of the Chojnów Landscape Park can also be found in this town.

== History ==

=== Before founding ===
This town was mentioned as early as 1252 in the documents of the Poznań bishop Boguchwał as &quot;Góra&quot;. In this year it was already collecting tithes from neighbouring villages. A functioning parish school here appeared in 1617, proving that the village was a wealthy one. However, the Swedish Deluge caused the destruction and depopulation of the village.

=== Founding ===
Stefan Wierzbowski, Bishop of Poznań purchased the ruined village. The town (initially called New Jerusalem) was founded in 1670 by Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki when he issued a founding document for &quot;Nowa Jerozolima&quot;. It belonged to Poznań bishops until 1795. It was founded at the site of two former villages, Góra and Wólka Górska, which were situated on the high Vistula scarp within the former Masovian Voivodeship. It was a city on a cross-shaped plan, with numerous chapels, monasteries and churches, mainly being based on images of ancient Jerusalem. It was intended as a centre for strengthening Catholicism and became the seat of famous tzadiks.

=== Town rights ===
The town received the privilege of Magdeburg rights, afterwards confirmed by John III Sobieski, allowing the organisation of two markets per week and four annual fairs (the dates of these events correlated with Catholic holidays). In order to attract settlers, in 1672, Wierzbicki issued a privilege which waived burgers&#x27; rents, tributes and taxes for a period of five years and established the town&#x27;s layout. Citizens were allowed to produce and sell alcoholic beverages, such as beer and vodka, deal with commerce and crafts and cater to visitors&#x27; needs.

=== 18th–20th century ===
At the end of the 18th century, a paper factory was established in Jeziorna, expanded in the following century and is in operation to this day. From the beginning of Congress Poland until the end of 2001, Góra Kalwaria was a garrison town. After the January Uprising, the tsarist authorities stripped Piaseczno and Góra Kalwaria of their city rights. By the Judicial reform of Alexander II in 1864, serfdom was abolished, and landed properties were severely reduced. The construction of a narrow-gauge railway from Warsaw to Góra Kalwaria occurred at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. It facilitated the transport of bricks from the Baniocha area to the expanding Warsaw, where clay was being exploited on a large scale at that time.

=== Hasidic Judaism in Góra Kalwaria ===
Hasidic Judaism appeared in Góra Kalwaria in 1859. From the start of the 20th century and perhaps even earlier, Góra Kalwaria was an important center of the Hasidic movement, first under the leadership of the Gerrer Rebbe Yehudah Aryeh Leib Alter, who died in 1905 and then under the leadership of his son, Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter. Hasidic pilgrims came to the town from around the world, due to which a railroad was constructed from Warsaw to help bring them. When Feliks (a Jew who survived World War II, born on November 29, 1926) was a boy, he said that the town had two synagogues. One was open everyday and the other was open just for Sabbath services and for holidays.

=== World War I ===

At the end of September 1914, the front reached Piaseczno, and in the first days of October, the areas close to Góra Kalwaria. The German army was heading towards the capital this way. The terrified rural population fled in panic, leaving their houses empty. In October, there were fights between the Russians, the Germans and the Austrians. The tsarist army launched a counteroffensive. However, in order to keep Warsaw, it was forced to cross to the left bank of the Vistula. Because of this, the Russians gathered all their strength and built a bridge in the vicinity of Góra Kalwaria in one day. After bloody battles took place in the city and its surroundings, cemeteries and mass graves remained in many towns, such as Wola, Dobieska, Solec, Moczydłów and Wólka Zaleska; Austrian, German and Russian soldiers were lying next to each other. Many of these graves have not survived to this day.

The inhabitants of Góra Kalwaria and the surrounding area were not well off, and most of them were downright poor. The war hit them extremely hard, often depriving them of all their possessions when passing troops burned villages. The houses, even if they survived, were completely plundered. In addition, soldiers trampled farmlands, destroyed orchards, and cut down entire swathes of forests. In Góra Kalwaria alone, in the fall of 1914, 15 houses were burned down and some gardens were devastated. The rectory was ruined, shops were robbed, and existing tea houses were destroyed. A temporary hospital was organized in Góra Kalwaria during the war. Volunteers tried to prevent starvation. A water collection point appeared in the city, with tea and boiling water also being distributed. Citizens&#x27; committees tried to help people, especially women whose husbands had been conscripted into the army.

The Germans entered Góra Kalwaria in the second week of August 1915, remaining here until November 11, 1918. However, the devastation of the city and the surrounding area continued. As they retreated, the Russians destroyed everything. Railway infrastructure, bridges and many buildings suffered damage. However, the German occupation had more than just bad consequences. The Germans paved many roads and built, among others: the road from Warka to Góra Kalwaria. They also supported education in these areas. Thanks to them, Góra Kalwaria regained its city rights in 1916, previously taken away by the tsarist regime.

=== Battle of Warsaw (1920) ===

On August 13–25, 1920, on the outskirts of Warsaw, the Battle of Warsaw, also known as the Miracle on the Vistula, took place. On August 13 and 14, near Góra Kalwaria, the crews of the Toruń squadron stopped the Red Army from crossing the Vistula. The section of the Vistula River bordering the city also became a fighting area. The crew passing by Góra Kalwaria noticed the enemy troops and immediately opened fire. Violent shelling forced the Russians to retreat.

=== World War II ===
Just before the war, from mid–May to July 1939, Polish sappers from Warsaw, Puławy and Modlin put a wooden and steel bridge over the Vistula River near Góra Kalwaria. The kilometer-long construction connected Brzumin with Piwonin. A battle took place there during the Nazi Invasion of Poland. The fight took place over the bridge. German troops then moving east wanted to use it to cross the river. Then Col. Tadeusz Komorowski sent a unit of lancers to defend it. Several hundred soldiers under the command of Maj. had only a few heavy machine guns, an anti-tank gun and two cannons. They had no chance in the fight against the 1st division of the 16th Panzer Corps of the Wehrmacht commanded by General Hans Schmidt, especially since they could not count on support because they lost radio contact with the command. After a few days, they fell to the enemy and 200 of them were taken prisoner by the Germans.

During the war, Piaseczno and Góra Kalwaria supplied the occupied capital in large quantities with flour, bread and some meat.

At the beginning of World War II, 3,000 out of about 7,000 residents were Jews. However, once the Germans took control of the town, they established a ghetto. It lasted until 1941, when most of Góra Kalwaria&#x27;s Jews were transported to the Warsaw Ghetto.

== Urban design ==

=== The original plan ===
The layout of a new town was subordinated to the celebrations of the Way of the Cross. It consisted of two main streets forming a Latin cross with a church (Pilate&#x27;s court) at the intersection. The plan followed medieval plans meant to resemble ancient Jerusalem. The Baroque composition extended far beyond the former village. The axes led to three monastery complexes: Bernardines, Piarists and Dominicans and the Saint Cross Church; their symmetrical distribution additionally emphasised the cross-shaped layout. The monastery of Oratorians, afterwards Friars of Holy Communion, supplemented the Saint Cross Church and enacted the ceremonies conducted in the sanctuary. Besides this, south-west from the town, two more monastery complexes were erected: Marians and Dominican Sisters, accessible from a side road which was connected to the main one next to the Dominicans Monastery. An attempt to emulate the ideal layout of Jerusalem had to be adjusted to local conditions. Not all the elements of the plan could be easily recreated, due to the local topography. For instance, Golgota Hill, which should have its location in the bottom left portion of the plan, could not be placed next to the embankment due to the lack of sufficient space for the required chapels there. The arrangement extended far into the open landscape, with numerous chapels situated in the surrounding forest. The longer axis, which used the existing ravine as a part of the terrain configuration, was defined with Kalwaryjska Street and the market square, its prolongation continued as the local road to Piaseczno.

The perpendicular axis used a section of the former road from Warsaw to Lublin. The tracing of pilgrims&#x27; paths was done in a way which consciously opened vast vistas and framed views to enrich the content of the biblical stories. The landscaping efforts additionally upgraded the images pilgrims were intended to absorb while treading along the processional paths. For instance, to improve the quality of the visual experience, the Saint Cross Church, which closed the perspective and, at the same time, was the final destination for the pilgrims, was exposed against the slope of a hill on which stood a large-scale cross. The main market, in the form of a trapezoid, covered a large area: 270m long and 90 to 100 meters wide. The eastern facade hosted a church and a monastery of the Bernardines; in the west facade, there was Pilate&#x27;s court. The two longer facades consisted of the townhouses of citizens. In the middle of the square, there were the stalls of merchants as allowed by the town charter. There was a wooden town hall from the beginning of the town; it was mentioned in the parish register and court archives. Initially, Kalwaryjska Street was much larger than it is now and opened perspectives on the whole of the arrangement located on the hill.

The town hall was built in later times, at the turn of the eighteenth and the nineteenth century, at first in very modest form.

=== 1970–1988 household statistics ===

In 1970, the highest share of single-person households (23-33%) was recorded, apart from the districts of Śródmieście and Praga-Północ, mainly in the suburbs of Warsaw in Góra Kalwaria, Kobyłka, Józefów, Konstancin-Jeziorna and Ząbki, and in the western part of the city (Podkowa Leśna, Piastów, Żyrardów, Milanówek). In 1970, 1978 and 1988, this share did not change much and amounted to 24-34%. However, Góra Kalwaria along with Ząbki, Konstancin-Jeziorna, Kobyłka dropped out of this group, and their place was taken by the remaining districts of Warsaw and the cities of Brwinów, Pruszków, Zakroczym and Kałuszyn.

The highest estimated level of residential construction intensity among cities (annual average of 10-20 apartments per 1,000 inhabitants) was recorded in: Legionowo, Mszczonów, Nowy Dwór, Góra Kalwaria, Błonie, Wołomin, and the districts of Praga Północ, Mokotów, Żoliborz and Wola. In the years 1978–1988, with a significantly lower level of residential construction intensity, the group of the &quot;least populated&quot; included: Karczew, Tłuszcz, Piastów and Żyrardów, while the group that dropped out was Błonie, Góra Kalwaria and all districts of Warsaw, except Mokotów.

The lowest residential construction intensity (annual average of 2-4 dwellings per 1000 inhabitants) in the first period was observed in cities of a specific character (agricultural, summer resorts or from the western part of the city), i.e. Serock, Karczew, Marki, Podkowa Leśna, Józefów, Konstancin-Jeziorna, Brwinów, Piastów, Zakroczym, Milanówek and the Śródmieście district. In the period 1978–1988, Karczew, Piastów, Zakroczym dropped out of this group of non-expanding centres, and Błonie, Góra Kalwaria, Otwock and the Ochota district were included in it.

=== Modern–day ===
In the Otwock County there are three main communication routes, one of them being the &quot;National road no. 50 Mińsk Mazowiecki – Kołbiel – Góra Kalwaria&quot; through which east–west transit bypasses Warsaw. The largest concentration of monuments in this county from the Baroque period can be found in Góra Kalwaria. These are: a unique layout of the town in the shape of a Latin cross, the Bernadine church and monastery, the church known as &quot;Pilate&#x27;s Chapel&quot; and the chapel of St. Anthony.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Church of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary ===

The most famous building in Góra Kalwaria is likely the Church of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, located in the heart of the town. It was founded in 1756 on the site of a destroyed earlier temple. It was built in Baroque style and was initially managed by the Bernardine monastery. However, the monastery operating next to the church was dissolved by the tsarist authorities for participating in the January Uprising. Since then, the building has served as a parish church. On the pillars of the gate in front of the church there are baroque sculptures depicting saints: Francis of Assisi, Anthony of Padua, John of Capistrano and Bernard of Siena, and on the front of the building there is a commemorative plaque &quot;Vota mea...&quot; (which translates to &quot;My vow&quot;).

The corners of the altars and cornices are decorated with characteristic angels. There is also the 18th-century baptismal font and the Stations of the Cross. The church has many monuments of painting, including the painting of Our Lady of Consolation from the early 17th century. On the side altars there are paintings by Szymon Czechowicz (the scene of the Presentation of Christ in the Jerusalem Temple, the Holy Family, Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Anthony of Padua). Another thing is the sarcophagus with the relics of Saint Valerian, made of black marble.
=== Bishop&#x27;s Palace ===
Opposite the church there is the Bishop&#x27;s Palace, which today houses the municipal library and the Cultural and Tourist Information Center. The building was built in the 17th century, but in the 18th century it was rebuilt in the classicist style by the Italian architect Jakub Fontana.

=== Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross ===
Nearby is the Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (colloquially &quot;Church on the Hill&quot;), also historically known as Pilate&#x27;s Town Hall. It was consecrated in 1679, but it gained its final shape in the 18th century, when it was rebuilt in Baroque style. In the basement there is the sarcophagus of Bishop Wierzbowski. The temple also houses a 16th-century Gothic Pietà, a Baroque cross and a Baroque figure of the Scourged Christ. There are also two paintings by the 17th-century artist Federico Barocci: &quot;The Nailing to the Cross&quot; and &quot;The Descent from the Cross&quot;. Currently, the church is a branch church. It can be visited and services are held there.

=== Piarist College ===
The complex of the Piarist Order was built in 1675. Young noblemen studied there. The college existed until 1819, when it was transformed into tsarist barracks. The residential pavilions adjoining the neo-Gothic chapel from the 19th century have survived to this day. Today, the college buildings house a Social Welfare Home. It is surrounded by a red wall (built in 1935).

=== Jewish–related ===
The building at Pijarska 5 is a former private prayer house (Bejt Midrash), built in 1903 by the Alter family of tzaddiks. During the occupation, the Germans carried out mass executions of Jews there. After the war, it was rebuilt into apartments and shops. Inside, two rows of cast-iron pillars supporting a flat ceiling have been preserved, and in the attic there is a unique matzah oven. The facility remains under the care of the Jewish community in Warsaw. In the yard on the opposite side of the street there is a red-brick synagogue built in 1905 after the fire of the earlier wooden synagogue. After the war, a carbonated water plant and a shop were located there. In 2000, the building was returned to the Jewish community. Inside, only the cast iron pillars of the gallery have survived. Right next to it is the building of the former court of Tzaddik Yitzchak Meir Rothenberg Alster and the residence of his successors.

In this town there is a Hortex plant and a modern swimming pool.

=== Demographics ===

At the beginning of World War II, 3,000 out of about 7,000 residents were Jews. However, once the Germans took control of the town, they established a ghetto. It lasted until 1941, when most of Góra Kalwaria&#x27;s Jews were transported to the Warsaw Ghetto. In August 2007, there were only two Jews left in town, one called Feliks and the other a man in his nineties. However, there are probably no Jews in the city anymore. However, in the wider world — for example in Israel or the United States — you can still find descendants and societies associated with the Court of Alters.

<text>Education in Denmark is compulsory () for children below the age of 15 or 16, even though it is not compulsory to attend &quot;Folkeskole&quot; (&quot;public school&quot;). The school years up to the age of fifteen/sixteen are known as &quot;Folkeskole&quot;, since any education has to match the level offered there. About 82% of young people take further education in addition to this. Government-funded education is usually free of charge and open to all. Denmark has a tradition of private schools and about 15.6% of all children at basic school level attend private schools, which are supported by a voucher system.

The Education Index, published with the UN&#x27;s Human Development Index in 2008, based on data from 2013, lists Denmark as 0.873, amongst the highest in the world, beneath Australia, Finland and New Zealand.

Literacy in Denmark is approximately 99% for both men and women.

==History==
The Danish education system has its origin in the cathedral and monastery schools established by the Roman Catholic Church in the early Middle Ages, and seven of the schools established in the 12th and 13th centuries still exist today. After the Reformation, which was officially implemented in 1536, the schools were taken over by the Crown. Their main purpose was to prepare the students for theological studies by teaching them to read, write and speak Latin and Greek.

Popular elementary education was at that time still very primitive, but in 1721, 240 &quot;rytterskoler&quot; (&quot;cavalry schools&quot;) were established throughout the kingdom. Moreover, the religious movement of Pietism, spreading in the 18th century, required some level of literacy, thereby promoting the need for public education. The philanthropic thoughts of such people as Rousseau also helped spur developments in education open to all children.

In 1809, the old Clergyman&#x27;s School was transformed in accordance with the spirit of the time into a humanistic Civil Servant&#x27;s School which was to &quot;foster true humanity&quot; through immersion in the ancient Greek and Latin cultures combined with some teaching of natural science and modern languages.

Throughout the 19th century (and even up until today), the Danish education system was especially influenced by the ideas of clergyman, politician and poet N. F. S. Grundtvig, who advocated inspiring methods of teaching and the foundation of folk high schools.

In 1871, the scientific and technical development of the 19th century led to a division of the secondary education into two lines: the languages and the mathematics-science line. This division was the backbone of the structure of the Gymnasium (i.e. academic general upper secondary education programme) until the year 2005.

In 1894, the &quot;Folkeskole&quot; (&quot;public school&quot;, the government-funded primary education system) was formally established (until then, it had been known as &quot;Almueskolen&quot; (&quot;common school&quot;)), and measures were taken to improve the education system to meet the requirements of industrial society.

In 1903, the 3-year course of the Gymnasium was directly connected the municipal school through the establishment of the &quot;&quot; (&#x27;middle school&#x27;, grades 6–9), which was later on replaced by the &quot;realskole&quot;. Previously, students wanting to go to the Gymnasium (and thereby obtain qualification for admission to university) had to take private tuition or similar means as the municipal schools were insufficient.

In 1975, the &quot;&quot; was abandoned and the &quot;Folkeskole&quot; (primary education) transformed into an egalitarian system where pupils go to the same schools regardless of their academic merits.

==Compulsory education==

The &quot;&quot; () covers the entire period of compulsory education, from the age of 5 - 6 to 15 - 16, encompassing pre-school, primary and lower secondary education.

==Secondary education==
Secondary education usually takes two to four years and is attended by students between the ages of 15 - 16 and 18 - 19. Secondary education is not compulsory, but usually free of charge, and students have a wide range of programmes to choose from. Some education programmes are academically oriented, the most common being the &quot;Gymnasium&quot;. Others are more practically oriented, training students for jobs as e.g. artisans or clerks through a combination of instruction in vocational schools and apprenticeship. In Denmark students have three attempts to finish their secondary education; from there on they are left on their own. If they wish to continue from here on, they are allowed to get an education but no longer with any economic support from the government.

==Post-secondary education==

Higher education in Denmark can take place at a number of different institutions that offer educations of different types. Only universities offer education at the master level, while university colleges offer certain bachelor degrees, but may collaborate with a university to offer a master level degree (such as the MA in Journalism at Aarhus University being a collaboration with the Danish School of Media and Journalism. Bachelor degree are either academic bachelor degrees at universities or professional bachelor degrees at university colleges (Danish: &quot;professionsbacheloruddannelse&quot;), but universities may also offer professional bachelor degrees, and for instance, you can take the education to become a social worker at Aalborg University.

===Business academies===
Business academies (Danish: &quot;Erhvervsakademi&quot;) offer two-year academy profession programmes; some business academies also offer professional bachelor programmes, further adult education and diploma programmes.

===Maritime educational institutions===

The maritime education institutions offer study programmes for the Danish merchant fleet and the fishing industry.

===University colleges===
Danish university colleges () offer profession specific tertiary education, also known as medium higher education (MVU) and diploma courses, but do not offer university education at postgraduate level.

===Institutions in architecture and art===
The institutions in architecture and art offer various degree programmes within the fine arts and applied arts.

===Universities===
The first university in Denmark, University of Copenhagen, was established in 1479. The second, University of Kiel in Schleswig-Holstein, was established in 1665. When Schleswig-Holstein was conquered by German forces in 1864, the University of Copenhagen was once again the only university in the Kingdom of Denmark and remained so until 1928 when the Aarhus University was founded. Since then, more universities have been established, and Denmark now has eight universities. 

Higher education in Denmark is free for students from the European Union and Switzerland. Many programmes are taught in English, including Bachelor&#x27;s, Master&#x27;s, PhD, exchange, and summer school programmes.

==Tuition and financial aid system==
Almost all educational institutes in Denmark are free. This tuition-fee-less system applies to all students who:
* have been born in Denmark (including the Faroe Islands and Greenland); or
* hold a permanent resident visa; or
* Permanent residence permit (&quot;)
* Temporary residence permit that can be upgraded to a permanent one (&quot;)
* Residence permit as the accompanying child of a non-EU/EEA parent holding a residence permit based on employment (§9a and §9m of the Danish Aliens Act - text in Danish)
* hold a humanitarian visa; or
* are from a country in the Nordic Council; or
* are from a country in the European Economic Area or European Union.

Not only are students charged no tuition fees, but all Danish citizens over 18 (and many others meeting certain criteria) are offered monthly financial aid, known as &quot;SU&quot; (&quot;Statens Uddannelsesstøtte&quot;, meaning &quot;State Educational Support&quot;), amounting for each student to about DKK 950 monthly if the student lives with their parents or guardians, and they have high incomes, and about DKK 5,486 monthly if the student lives away from their parents or guardians. Students can supplement the SU with low-interest government loans amounting to DKK 2,807 per month, which must be paid back upon the completion of their education.

== Academic freedom ==

Wright and Ørberg (2008) came to a critical conclusion on the Danish system of higher education: &quot;The Danish model combines the worst of both the free trade and the modernising state models of autonomy: universities, their leaders and academics are given freedom in the sense of individual responsibility for their own economic survival, whilst the sector comes under heavy political control. This is called &quot;setting universities free&quot;.&quot; In a 2017 comparative study on academic freedom in the universities of 28 European Union members, Denmark ranks only 24th. In all categories (academic freedom in legislation; institutional autonomy in legislation; self-governance in legislation; job security; constitution and international agreements), Denmark ranked below the EU average. The authors of the study argue that the restrictions on academic freedom in Denmark would, in most other EU states, be considered draconian.

<text>[[Pre-school]] [[Education]] in [[Denmark]] is voluntary and takes place in different types of schools or day care centres covering the time before children enter compulsory education. Today, preschool is where most children enter the Danish education system.

== Historical overview ==
The first pre-schools in Denmark were established in the 1820s by a private initiative intended to instruct the children of working families, where both parents worked outside the home. During the period between 1850 and 1900, private educational institutions appeared that were open only on a part-time basis. These institutions had pedagogical objectives unlike those of the previous schools that were mostly mere retention centres for children of working parents, and were aimed at the children of the more privileged classes.

The social reform of 1933 made it possible for these institutions to receive up to 50 percent of their operational expenditure from the state. From that point on, the state and the municipalities have gradually obtained the biggest financial and pedagogical responsibility for the administration of these institutions. Financial support was also made available in 1949 for institutions that had not been entitled to it before, as they did not meet the conditions of the act to the effect that they catered to children from disadvantaged families. The pedagogical objective of the institutions was thus recognised.

An act in 1964 obliged the authorities to make all public services available to all citizens. The right to pre-school education was also emphasised in the Social Assistance Act of 1976, which demanded that the municipalities create the necessary infrastructure to meet the needs of families. 

In 1987, the state delegated responsibility for the financial administration of the pre-school institutions to municipalities.

== Types of Institutions ==
75% of established day-care institutions are municipal day-care centres while the other fourth are privately owned and are run by associations, parents, or businesses in agreement with local authorities. In terms of both finances and subject-matter, municipal and private institutions function according to the same principles. In 2007 96% of all children aged 3–5 years and about 90% of the children aged 1–2 years attended a day-care institution.
Pre-school education is primarily offered in the following institutions:
* Nurseries (), literally &#x27;cradle halls&#x27;) for children between six months and three years of age. Size: 30 to 60 children;
* Kindergartens () for children between three and six to seven years of age. Size: 20 to 80 children;
* Integrated institutions for groups with a wider age-group distribution than the two other types. Size: 40 to 150 children;
* Municipal child-care facilities established by private individuals taking in a few children (). Size: 4 to 5 children.
* Pre-school classes (, literally &#x27;kindergarten classes&#x27;) established at primary schools and catering for children from the age of five to six as the first year of compulsory education (cf. US Kindergarten, English Reception). Average size: 19.7 children (1999)

== Admission Requirements ==
In theory, the only admission requirement to this type of institution is age, so that the minimum age to attend a nursery is six months, kindergartens three years, integrated institutions one year, and pre-school five to six years. However, as there are more parents requesting space in the first three types of institutions than there is space, municipalities distribute places taking into consideration the following categories of children:
* Children with special pedagogical or social needs
* Children of one-parent families
* Children sent by another authority
* Children of parents working away from the home
* Children whose brothers or sisters are already enrolled in the institution.

== General Objectives ==
The Social Service Act stipulates that pre-school facilities shall form part of the total plan for general and preventive measures for children. It is the general objective to create, in co-operation with the parents, a framework which favours the development, well-being, and independence of children. These measures must ensure children have a normal day that at the same time give them security and challenges, and where close links with adults can develop. Furthermore, according to the Act on the Folkeskole, its aim is to familiarise children with the daily routines of school life.

The work of the day care centres are carried out by pedagogues rather than teachers. They are usually assisted by untrained assistants. The pedagogues tend to use a recognising approach where the child is appreciated as a human being.

There is a large focus on learning social skills, motor skills, cultural norms etc. rather than traditional school work such as learning how to read and write.
Leading researchers argue to that these factors are one of the reasons why Danish people are the happiest in the world.

== Curriculum, Subjects, Number of Hours ==
In principle, pre-school teachers are free to choose content, working methods, didactical material, and so forth. However, a municipality may draw up an educational plan, and the boards may define the principles of the activities an institution. Teaching takes the form of play and other development-based activities. There are no formalised classes or lessons. In fact, the earlier stages of Danish pre-school education mostly have the character of childcare rather than formal education.

There is no educational plan for the activities in pre-school classes, but school authorities may propose guidelines for the content of the activities. The weekly minimum number of lessons in pre-school is 20 lessons divided into three to four hours a day, five days a week.

== Evaluation ==
There are no formalised rules regarding observation and monitoring, but many educators have an interest in working with interaction-based observation. It is common for an institution to hold parent consultations, where the staff of the institution discuss with individual children&#x27;s parents how children thrive in the institution, what they occupy themselves with, their strong and weak points, and about their social relationship with other children.

<text>John Paul Vann (born John Paul Tripp; July 2, 1924 – June 9, 1972) was a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army, later retired, who became well known for his role in the Vietnam War. Although separated from the military before the Vietnam War reached its peak, he returned to service as a civilian under the auspices of the United States Agency for International Development and by the waning days of the war was the first American civilian to command troops in regular combat there. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and was the only civilian in Vietnam to receive the Distinguished Service Cross. He died on June 9, 1972, in a helicopter crash in Vietnam just after the Battle of Kontum.

==Early life==
Born John Paul Tripp in Norfolk, Virginia, on July 2, 1924, out of wedlock, to John Spry and Myrtle Lee Tripp. Vann&#x27;s mother married Aaron Frank Vann, and Vann took his stepfather&#x27;s surname; Vann had three half-siblings. In 1942, Aaron Vann officially adopted him. Although the Vann children grew up in near-poverty, Vann was able to attend boarding school at Ferrum College through the patronage of a wealthy member of his church. He graduated from its high school in 1941, and from its junior college program in 1943. With the onset of World War II, Vann sought to become an aviator/pilot.

==Military career==
In 1943, at the age of 18, Vann enlisted in the United States Army Air Force. He underwent pilot training, transferred to navigation school, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1945. However, the war ended before he could see action.

Vann married Mary Jane Allen of Rochester, New York in October 1945, at the age of 21. They had five children.

When the Army Air Force separated from the Army in 1947 to form its own branch, the United States Air Force, Vann chose to remain in the Army and transferred to the infantry. He was assigned to Korea, and then Japan, as a logistics officer. When the Korean War began in June 1950, Vann coordinated the transportation of his 25th Infantry Division to Korea. Vann joined his unit, which was placed on the critical Pusan Perimeter until the amphibious Inchon landing relieved the beleaguered forces.

In late 1950, in the wake of China&#x27;s entrance into the war and the retreat of allied forces, now-Captain Vann was given his first command, a Ranger company, the Eighth Army Ranger Company. He led the unit on reconnaissance missions behind enemy lines for three months, before a serious illness in one of his children resulted in his transfer back to the United States. While assigned to Rutgers University&#x27;s ROTC program as an assistant professor of military science and tactics, he received a Bachelor of Science degree with a concentration in economics and statistics in 1954.

In 1954, Vann joined the 16th Infantry Regiment in Schweinfurt, Germany, becoming the head of the regiment&#x27;s Heavy Mortar Company. A year later, he was promoted to major and transferred to Headquarters U.S. Army Europe at Heidelberg, where he returned to logistics work.

Vann returned to the U.S. to attend the Command and General Staff College (a prerequisite for further promotion) in 1957. During this period, he earned a Master of Business Administration degree from Syracuse University in 1959 and completed all course requirements for a PhD in public administration at the university&#x27;s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1961.

===Vietnam War service===
Vann was voluntarily assigned to South Vietnam in 1962 as an adviser to Colonel Huỳnh Văn Cao, commander of the ARVN IV Corps. In the thick of the anti-guerrilla war against the Viet Cong, Vann became concerned with the way in which the war was being prosecuted, in particular the disastrous Battle of Ap Bac. Directing the battle from a spotter plane overhead, he earned the Distinguished Flying Cross for his bravery in taking enemy fire. He attempted to draw public attention to the problems through press contacts such as &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter David Halberstam, directing much of his ire towards MACV commander General Paul D. Harkins. Vann completed his Vietnam assignment in March 1963 and left the Army within a few months, having completed 20 years of service.

==Civilian career==
Vann accepted a job in Denver, Colorado with defense contractor Martin Marietta. Although he succeeded there for nearly two years, he missed Vietnam and angled to return. Vann returned to Vietnam in March 1965 as an official of the Agency for International Development (AID).

After an assignment as province senior adviser, Vann was made Deputy for Civil Operations and Rural Development Support (CORDS) in the Third Corps Tactical Zone of Vietnam, which consisted of the twelve provinces north and west of Saigon—the part of South Vietnam most important to the US. CORDS was an integrated group that consisted of USAID, U.S. Information Service, Central Intelligence Agency and State Department along with U.S. Army personnel to provide needed manpower. Among other undertakings, CORDS was responsible for the Phoenix Program, which involved neutralization of the Viet Cong infrastructure. 

Vann served as Deputy for Civil Operations and Rural Development Support CORDS III (i.e., commander of all civilian and military advisers in the Third Corps Tactical Zone) until November 1968 when he was assigned to the same position in IV Corps, which consisted of the provinces south of Saigon in the Mekong Delta.

Vann was highly respected by a large segment of officers and civilians who were involved in the broader political aspects of the war because he favored small units performing aggressive patrolling instead of grandiose engagements by large units. Unlike many US soldiers, he was respectful toward the ARVN soldiers notwithstanding their low morale and was committed to training and strengthening their morale and commitment. He encouraged his personnel to engage themselves in Vietnamese society as much as possible and he constantly briefed that the Vietnam War must be envisaged as a long war at a lower level of engagement rather than a short war at a big-unit, high level of engagement.

On one of his trips back to the U.S. in December 1967, Vann was asked by Walt Rostow, an advocate of more troops and Johnson administration National Security Advisor, whether the U.S. would be over the worst of the war in six months: &quot;Oh hell no, Mr. Rostow&quot;, replied Vann, &quot;I&#x27;m a born optimist. I think we can hold out longer than that.&quot; Vann&#x27;s wit and iconoclasm did not endear him to many military and civilian careerists but he was a hero to many young civilian and military officers who understood the limits of conventional warfare in the irregular environment of Vietnam.

After his assignment to IV Corps, Vann was assigned as the senior American advisor in II Corps Military Region in the early 1970s when American involvement in the war was winding down and troops were being withdrawn. For that reason, his new job put him in charge of all United States personnel in his region, where he advised the ARVN (Army of the Republic of Vietnam) commander to the region and became the first American civilian to command U.S. regular troops in combat. His position was the equivalent in responsibilities of a major general in the US Army.

==Death==
Three days after the Battle of Kontum, Vann was killed when his helicopter crashed into a grove of trees near a village cemetery. He was 47 years old. He was buried on June 16, 1972, in Section 11 of Arlington National Cemetery. His funeral was attended by General William Westmoreland, Major General Edward Lansdale, Lieutenant Colonel Lucien Conein, Senator Edward Kennedy, and Daniel Ellsberg.

==Legacy==
On June 18, President Richard Nixon posthumously awarded Vann the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation&#x27;s highest civilian citation, for his ten years of service in South Vietnam. For his actions from April 23–24, 1972, Vann, ineligible for the Medal of Honor as a civilian, was also awarded (posthumously) the Distinguished Service Cross, the only civilian so honored since World War II.

Neil Sheehan wrote a Pulitzer Prize-winning Vietnam history and biography of Vann, &quot;A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam&quot;, in which Sheehan also examines two of Vann&#x27;s alleged career-stunting incidents involving morals charges during his service in West Germany and at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and how these possibly affected Vann&#x27;s future actions and resulting career path both in and after Vietnam. In 1998, HBO made the film &quot;A Bright Shining Lie&quot;, adapted from the book, with Bill Paxton playing the role of Vann.

==Quotes==

*&quot;It was a miserable damn performance.&quot; (speaking of the Battle of Ap Bac)
*&quot;If it were not for the fact that Vietnam is but a pawn in the larger East-West confrontation, and that our presence here is essential to deny the resources of this area to Communist China, then it would be damned hard to justify our support of the existing government.&quot;
*&quot;This is a political war and it calls for discrimination in killing. The best weapon for killing would be a knife, but I&#x27;m afraid we can&#x27;t do it that way. The worst is an airplane. The next worst is artillery. Barring a knife, the best is a rifle — you know who you&#x27;re killing.&quot;
*&quot;We don&#x27;t have twelve years&#x27; experience in Vietnam. We have one year&#x27;s experience twelve times over.&quot;
*&quot;In one fell swoop [President Thieu&#x27;s Land to the Tiller Program] eliminated tenancy in Vietnam. All rents were suspended.&quot;
*&quot;The basic fact of life is that the overwhelming majority of the population — somewhere around 95 percent — prefer the government of Vietnam to a Communist government or the government that&#x27;s being offered by the other side.&quot;
*&quot;These people may be the world&#x27;s greatest lovers but they&#x27;re not the world&#x27;s greatest fighters. But they&#x27;re good people and they can win a war if someone shows them how.&quot; (speaking about the South Vietnamese)
*&quot;That’s the best damn bombing I’ve seen in my 11 years over here!&quot; (speaking about the South Vietnam Air Force pilots in Kontum 1972)
*&quot;I will turn this into a burning Hell&quot; speaking to MACV Team 36 advisor CPT RE McCall in February 1972 regarding the planned NVA offensive in Pleiku Province.&quot;
*”Next time I’ll make goddam sure they’re old enough”, after narrowly avoiding court martial for statutory rape, December 1959.

<doc id="754044" wikidata="Q3961717" url="?curid=754044" title="Adjournment sine die">
<text>Adjournment &quot;sine die&quot; (from Latin &quot;without a date&quot;) is the conclusion of a meeting by a deliberative assembly, such as a legislature or organizational board, without setting a date to reconvene. The assembly can reconvene, either in its present form or a reconstituted form, if preexisting laws and rules provide for this. Otherwise the adjournment effectively dissolves the assembly.

A court may also adjourn a matter &quot;sine die&quot;, which means that the matter is stayed until further notice. In a &quot;sine die&quot; adjournment of this type, the hearing stands open indefinitely, and could theoretically be resumed if the situation changed. For example, a case may be adjourned &quot;sine die&quot; if there is no possibility of proceeding in the foreseeable future, such as when the defendant is in prison and cannot participate in legal proceedings.

==United States usage==
The Congress of the United States customarily adjourns a session &quot;sine die&quot; on the morning of January 3, immediately before the next session holds its constitutionally mandated first meeting. It can also adjourn &quot;sine die&quot; at other times through a concurrent resolution that allows the Speaker of the House and Senate Majority Leader to resume the session.

State legislatures follow suit and mark adjournment &quot;sine die&quot; with a ceremony, such as the Connecticut General Assembly wherein, on the final day of the legislative session, the House and Senate meet in a joint convention, and the Secretary of the State recites &quot;Oyez, Oyez, Oyez&quot;, pounds the gavel, and declares the legislature adjourned &quot;sine die&quot;. 

In the Florida Legislature, the sergeants-at-arms of the Florida Senate and the Florida House of Representatives step outside their chambers each holding a handkerchief. When they meet in between the chambers, they both drop the handkerchiefs, signifying the end of the legislative session.

==Hong Kong usage==
On 28 June 1997, Andrew Wong, President of the last Legislative Council of Hong Kong as a British crown colony, which was to be dissolved by the incoming sovereign power over Hong Kong, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and replaced by a provisional legislature, declared at the end of its last session: &quot;In accordance with the Standing Orders of the Legislative Council, I now adjourn the Council, &quot;sine die&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="754047" wikidata="Q7127443" url="?curid=754047" title="Palestra">
<text>The Palestra, often called the Cathedral of College Basketball, is a historic arena and the home gym of the Penn Quakers men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams, volleyball teams, wrestling team, and Philadelphia Big 5 basketball. Located at 235 South 33rd St. in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania, near Franklin Field in the University City section of Philadelphia, it opened on January 1, 1927. The Palestra has been called &quot;the most important building in the history of college basketball&quot; and &quot;changed the entire history of the sport for which it was built&quot;.

The arena originally seated about 10,000, but now seats 8,725 for basketball. The Palestra is famed for its close-to-the-court seating with the bleachers ending at the floor with no barrier to separate the fans from the game.

At the time of its construction, the Palestra was one of the world&#x27;s largest arenas. It was one of the first steel-and-concrete arenas in the United States and also one of the first to be constructed without interior pillars blocking the view.

Since its inception, the Palestra has hosted more games, more visiting teams, and more NCAA tournaments than any other facility in college basketball.

==History==
The building was completed in 1927 and named by Greek professor William N. Bates after the ancient Greek term &quot;palæstra&quot;, a rectangular enclosure attached to a gymnasium where athletes would compete in various sports in front of an audience. Penn&#x27;s Palestra was built adjacent to and today is connected to Hutchinson Gymnasium.

The Palestra hosted its first basketball game on January 1, 1927. Pennsylvania defeated Yale 26–15 before a capacity crowd of 10,000, then the largest crowd ever to attend a basketball game on the East Coast.

For many years, the building shared the same management as Madison Square Garden in New York City. Teams wishing to play at the Manhattan venue were often required to schedule a game at the Palestra, which thereby hosted several very high-level sporting events. Many professional games were played at the Palestra before the completion of the Spectrum in 1967.

The arena hosted the 1968 Intercontinental Cup basketball tournament.

The Palestra&#x27;s 50th Anniversary was celebrated on February 10, 1977.

During the 2011 NBA lockout, on September 25, 2011, a team including NBA stars LeBron James, Chris Paul, and Carmelo Anthony, among others, took on Team Philly, a team of NBA players with connections to the Philadelphia area. Team Philly won the game 131–122 in front of 8,725 attendees.

==College basketball at the Palestra==
 The Palestra has hosted more regular season or post-season NCAA men&#x27;s basketball games, more visiting teams, and more NCAA tournaments than any other U.S. arena. It is often called &quot;the birthplace of college basketball&quot;. It has hosted the East regionals six times (most recently in 1980), and the sub-regionals ten times (most recently in 1984). In total, 52 NCAA Tournament games have been played at the gym since it first came to Penn&#x27;s campus in 1939.

The Philadelphia Big 5 (Penn, Saint Joseph&#x27;s, Temple, La Salle, Villanova) originally played all of its games at the Palestra. Today, the intra-city conference still plays about half of its round-robin games there. St. Joseph&#x27;s hosts its Big 5 games at the gym, which is larger than its own Michael Hagan Arena, formerly Alumni Memorial Fieldhouse. During the 2008-09 basketball season, Saint Joseph&#x27;s played all their home games at the Palestra while the then Alumni Memorial Fieldhouse was undergoing an extensive renovation to become the Hagan Arena. The annual Battle of 33rd Street between Penn and Drexel was also held at the Palestra until 2013, when the series was suspended due to a location dispute. In 2015, the series resumed; however, it became a home-and-home series alternating between The Palestra and Daskalakis Athletic Center every year.

In addition, parts or all of the 1989-95 Atlantic 10 Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournaments were contested there, as were the 1985 MEAC men&#x27;s basketball tournament and the inaugural Ivy League men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tournaments in 2017. The gym has also served as the site of many Philadelphia and PIAA championship games.

The Palestra hosted a Big Ten Conference game between Michigan State and Penn State on January 7, 2017, with the &quot;home-standing&quot; Nittany Lions prevailing 72–63. Penn State has continued to do this in several of the following seasons, with the next match-up taking place in the 2024–25 season.

The 2017 Ivy League men&#x27;s basketball tournament (March 11–12, 2017) and the 2018 Ivy League men&#x27;s basketball tournament (March 10–11, 2018) were held at the Palestra.

==2000 renovation==

In 2000, a $2 million renovation to the gym added a museum celebrating the history of Philadelphia basketball in the building&#x27;s main concourse. Near the main entrance to the gym is a section recognizing the St. Joseph&#x27;s acclaimed Hawk mascot who made its first appearance at the Palestra on Jan. 4, 1956. At the other end of the concourse, by the ramp to sections 211 and 210, a scoreboard lists the all-time record of the Penn-Princeton rivalry. Each decade, from the 1950s onward, has its own exhibit in the concourse. The 1970s section, &quot;A Decade of Prominence&quot;, celebrates the Final Four runs by Villanova (1971) and Penn (1979).

In summer 2007, ESPN Classic broadcast a one-hour documentary on the historic arena, entitled &quot;The Palestra: Cathedral of Basketball&quot;. This feature-length documentary traces the evolution of college basketball through the rise of the arena. NBA great Bill Bradley, Naismith Hall of Fame Coaches Chuck Daly, Jack Ramsay and John Chaney, best-selling sports author John Feinstein, Penn Band director R. Greer Cheeseman III, and then-CBS/ESPN analyst Bill Raftery are interviewed. The film was written, produced and directed by former Penn Women&#x27;s Basketball player Mikaelyn Austin (founder of Philly Philms).

<text>Kiliaen van Rensselaer (; 1586 – buried 7 October 1643) was a Dutch diamond and pearl merchant from Amsterdam who was one of the founders and directors of the Dutch West India Company, being instrumental in the establishment of New Netherland.

He was one of the first patroons, but the only one to become successful. He founded the Manor of Rensselaerswyck in what is now mainly New York&#x27;s Capital District. His estate remained throughout the Dutch and British colonial era and the American Revolution as a legal entity until the 1840s. Eventually, that came to an end during the Anti-Rent War.

Van Rensselaer was the son of Hendrick Wolter van Rensselaer, a soldier from Nijkerk in the &quot;States army of the duke of Upper Saxony&quot;, and Maria Pafraet, descendant of a well-known printers&#x27; dynasty. To keep from risking his life in the army like his father, he apprenticed under his uncle, a successful Amsterdam jeweler. He too became a successful jeweler and was one of the first subscribers to the Dutch West India Company upon its conception.

The concept of patroonships may have been Kiliaen van Rensselaer&#x27;s; he was likely the leading proponent of the Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions, the document that established the patroon system.
His patroonship became the most successful to exist, making full use of his business tactics and advantages, such as his connection to the Director of New Netherland, his confidantes at the West India Company, and his extended family members who were eager to immigrate to a better place to farm. Van Rensselaer married twice and had at least eleven children. When he died some time after 1642, two succeeded him as patroons of Rensselaerswyck.

Van Rensselaer had a marked effect on the history of the United States. The American Van Rensselaers all descend from Kiliaen&#x27;s son Jeremias and the subsequent Van Rensselaer family is noted for being a very powerful and wealthy influence in the history of New York and the Northeastern United States, producing multiple State Legislators, Congressmen, and two Lieutenant Governors in New York.

==Early years==
Kiliaen van Rensselaer was born in Hasselt, Overijssel, Netherlands in 1586. The exact day of his birth is unknown. He was the son of Hendrick van Rensselaer and Maria Pafraet. His father was a captain in the Dutch army until his death at the siege of Ostend in early June 1602.

With his father usually not home (and eventually meeting his death) because of a military career, Van Rensselaer&#x27;s mother sent him to apprentice with his uncle, Wolfert van Bijler, a jeweler and diamond merchant. At the time, the gem trade was a prosperous enterprise to join, being a well-developed craft. In those days, the diamond trade was nearly always combined with the trade in pearls, other articles of luxury, and rarities of every description. Dutch jewelers found a ready market for their valuable wares at the Dutch imperial court and the smaller German courts. This realm of work promoted Van Rensselaer to a life of economic success.

Much of Van Rensselaer&#x27;s early life is unknown to today&#x27;s historians, though in March 1608 it has been recorded that he was taking care of some business of Van Bijler in Prague. It seems Van Bijler gradually retired from his business, leaving it in the control of Van Rensselaer. During his tenure at the helm of his uncle&#x27;s business, Van Rensselaer proposed a merger with the firm of Jan van Wely, son of one of Van Bijler&#x27;s sisters, who had an equally successful jewelry business. The firms combined under the name of Jan van Wely &amp; Co. in February 1614. Van Rensselaer&#x27;s name was not included in the name of the new company, since he contributed only one eighth of the investment capital, whereas van Wely contributed half (192,000 guilders). 

In 1616, van Wely was called on by Prince Maurice to meet at The Hague for a sale in jewels. He was murdered while waiting to meet with the Prince. The firm&#x27;s contract stipulated that at the death of Jan van Wely, the remaining members of the firm should continue the partnership for another six years. Van Wely&#x27;s murder, therefore, caused no change in the business, but it seems that at the expiration of that time, Van Rensselaer began again on his own account, founding Kiliaen van Rensselaer &amp; Co. with partner Jacques I&#x27;Hermite.

==Director of the Dutch West India Company==
Some of Van Rensselaer&#x27;s success as a jewel merchant came about due to trade made possible by the Dutch East India Company. The practical spirit of the Dutch merchant could not fail to recognize that the way to riches was through trade with the West Indies and Africa. During the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce, Dutch merchants had sailed unmolested to the West Indies but also received no letters of marque to take prizes from the enemy.

Before the Eighty Years&#x27; War began, people realized that the West Indies trade might bring great prosperity to the country and that more power might be developed against Spain. Rather than travel to the area singly on an armed ship or in the company of a few other vessels, traders could do business in the manner of the large and prosperous East India Company. A company for carrying on commerce in the West Indies and Africa could be organized, which might, like the sister company, act as the war-waging power in those parts and be supported by the treasury, ships, and troops of the United Netherlands.

After long years of preparation, the Charter of the Dutch West India Company was granted by the States General on 3 June 1621, and the subscription list was opened. It is known that subscriptions did not come in very rapidly at first due to the exclusion of the salt trade from the charter. This barrier was overcome in a later amendment to the Charter, and the subscription rate increased.

With a capital of seven million florins, the West India Company was granted exclusive authority and trade privileges in the Dutch possessions of the two Americas, as well as the coast of Africa from the Tropic of Cancer to the Cape of Good Hope. The objects of its creation were to establish an efficient and aggressive Atlantic maritime power in the struggle with Spain, as well as to colonize, develop, and rule the Dutch American dependencies — particularly New Netherland (the modern states of New York and New Jersey), discovered by Henry Hudson in 1609.

The Dutch West India Company was the largest trafficker in the Atlantic slave trade. 

Van Rensselaer was one of the first subscribers to the West India Company. As with the other subscribers, he contributed 6000 guilders to be a member of one of its chambers. Having paid his way, he was welcomed to the Chamber of Amsterdam, one of five Chambers of the West India Company, each located in a principal Dutch city. The Chamber of Amsterdam was the largest with twenty members, mainly due to the city&#x27;s population, and represented four ninths of the management of the West India Company.

Due to the practical limitations of meetings with 74 members on a regular basis (the total number of members from the five Chambers), the Charter called for a board of directors comprising nineteen members of the five Chambers. Van Rensselaer was chosen a member of this College of XIX, as it was called. It is said that care was exercised in the selection of the directors of each chamber, and only men of wealth and the highest known integrity were eligible for the trust. Van Rensselaer was apparently known as an unusually clear-headed man and an able and practical merchant who did not limit himself to his own branch of trade. These qualities presumably garnered the trust needed to be elected to the College of XIX.

In its role supporting colonization of New Netherland, the West India Company had an executive board of nine members from the College of XIX to manage the concerns of their colony. Van Rensselaer was also a member of this group. In the early career of the Company, he was one of its mainstays, placing several of his vessels at its disposal and twice advancing money to save its credit. His name is conspicuously identified with all its measures of policy, including the original settlement of Manhattan Island, New Amsterdam.

==Patroon==

Unfortunately for the West India Company, the infant colony of New Netherland languished. The Dutch Republic was economically thriving, causing the cautious Dutch people to show very little inclination to emigrate to wild and uncultivated lands in which no substantial inducements were present. While the economic situation of the colony in the late 1620s could be considered a relatively good showing for a colony only newly started in a wilderness, its slow success was hardly sufficient to create much excitement among the directors of the West India Company. Within a few years, the Company realized that special measures which would afford a stimulus to colonization were indispensable.

It was for these reasons that the Company proposed the Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions, which the States General ratified on 7 June 1629. This document was created to encourage settlement of New Netherland through the establishment of feudal patroonships purchased and supplied by members of the West India Company. With a total of 31 articles, the document spells out many requirements of these patroons, primarily stating that each patroon was required to purchase the land from the local Indians, and inhabit the land with 50 adults within four years, with at least one quarter arriving within one year. In return, the patroons were able to own the land and pass it to succeeding generations as a perpetual fiefdom, as well as receive protection and free African slaves from the Company.

It is believed that the system of patroonships was originally suggested by Van Rensselaer himself. He was reportedly one of the first of the Company to perceive that the building up of New Netherland could not be carried on without labor, and that labor could not be procured without permanent settlers. &quot;Open up the country with agriculture: that must be our first step,&quot; was his urgent advice. The Company was not inclined to involve itself in further expense for colonization, and matters threatened to come to a halt, when someone — very likely Van Rensselaer himself — evolved the plan of granting large estates to men willing to pay the cost of settling and operating them.

Van Rensselaer was quick to take part in the new endeavor: on 13 January 1629, he sent notification to the Directors of the Company that he, in conjunction with fellow Company members Samuel Godin and Samuel Blommaert, had sent Gillis Houset and Jacob Jansz Cuyper to determine satisfactory locations for settlement. This took place even before the Charter was ratified, but was done in accordance with a draft of the Charter from 28 March 1628.

The agents had sent out a favorable report. They had selected an extensive domain on both sides of the North River in the vicinity of Fort Orange for Van Rensselaer, which extended in length, in breadth and covered an area of almost . The location relative to the fort was chosen with care — in case of danger, it would be a sure point of defense or retreat, and its garrison would be very likely to intimidate the natives. In this manner Van Rensselaer employed the troops of the Company more or less as coadjutors to his colonizing plans. Furthermore, the fort would become an easily reached marketplace for the colonists, where they could maintain communication with the outside world. For that reason, Van Rensselaer diligently maintained friendly relations with the commander of the garrison and the authorities within the walls.
His first act was to obtain possession of the land for his colony from the Mohican, the original owners, who had never been willing to sell their territory — not even the ground of Fort Orange. However, after they had been involved in a bloody war with their neighbors, the Mohawks, and were defeated in 1629, they were found ready to dispose of their possessions. In April, two officers of the West India Company in Fort Orange, Sebastiaen Jansen Krol and Dirk Cornelisz Duyster, specially empowered by writing of 12 January 1630, purchased a large tract of land on the west side of the North River (today&#x27;s Hudson). Gillis Houset, one of the men initially sent to determine a settlement location, increased this territory in August by adding tracts of land on the east bank, located above and below Fort Orange. After the initial expansion, the territory was later further extended by deeds of purchase in May 1631 and April 1637.

The most troublesome aspect of settling the patroonships was enlisting the required number of colonists, resulting in the failure of many that were proposed. The patroons still dealt with the issues of a cautious people not caring to venture to an undeveloped world. As an owner of extensive lands in the sandy Gooi and of family estates in the not much more fruitful Veluwe, where several relatives were landowners and struggled to subsist on meager means, Van Rensselaer had an advantage — his agents needed to employ little persuasion to induce some Gooiers and Veluwers to migrate to more fruitful regions where the farming would be less difficult. In addition, he could depend on the indirect support of his nephew Wouter van Twiller, who had been appointed Director of New Netherland in 1632, and with whom he engaged in friendly correspondence at a time when Dutch directors opposed the patroons in every way. In 1634 he collaborated with Michael Reyniersz Pauw, the patroon of Pavonia on shipping cattle.

With that, Van Rensselaer shipped out 37 immigrants on his ship &quot;Rensselaerswijck&quot; from Amsterdam on 26 September 1636. The vessel arrived on 7 April 1637. The population rose to more than 100 by 1642 and doubled that in the next ten years. The village of Beverwyck alone had more than 1000 inhabitants by 1660 and is said to have become urban by this point.

The good understanding between the patroons of the Amsterdam Chamber left nothing to be desired; Burgh, Godyn, Blommaert, and Van Rensselaer, before signifying to the directors their willingness to start colonies, made an agreement to work the projected colonies on joint account, each under the direction of one of them. Three of them would have a one-fifth share in each colony, while the fourth would receive the remaining two fifths, taking the responsibility for its management and exercising patroon rights.

Only Rensselaerswyck was a successful patroonship. Van Rensselaer successively purchased Godyn&#x27;s share in the patroonship from his heirs, so that van Rensselaer soon became the owner of three-fifths. The two other shares remained partly in the hands of Blommaert and partly in the hands of others: Adam Bessels owning Blommaert&#x27;s fifth, while Johannes de Laet and Toussaint Muyssaert split Burgh&#x27;s fifth between them.

Letters saved by the Van Rensselaer family show that Kiliaen van Rensselaer never visited his colony in person.

==Personal life==
Van Rensselaer was married twice, first to his cousin Hillegonda van Bijler, on 23 July 1616. As the sole heir of her father Wolfert van Bijler (or Byllaer), she inherited 12,000 guilders. Hillegonda van Bijler was born around 1598, making her near the age of 18 at the time of her marriage to Van Rensselaer. The same year, the young husband purchased a couple of lots on the east side of the recently dug Keizersgracht in Amsterdam, between Marten and Wolven streets, where he built a house.

Van Rensselaer and Van Bijler had three children. The first was Hendrick, Kiliaen&#x27;s first son, believed to have died in childhood. Johan, their second son, was baptized on 4 September 1625. Maria, their last child, was buried on 4 January 1627. She died as an infant.

Hillegonda van Bijler is presumed to have died in late December 1626, since she was buried on 1 January 1627, three days before her third child Maria. She was around the age of 28 and the couple had been married less than eleven years.

Van Rensselaer re-married on 14 December 1627, to Anna van Wely, daughter of Van Rensselaer&#x27;s former business partner. Van Wely was born around 1601, making her about 26 at the time of the marriage. The couple had eight children between 1629 and 1639, four boys and four girls:

*Jan Baptist: baptized 18 March 1629;
*Maria: baptized 23 March 1631;
*Jeremias: baptized 18 May 1632;
*Hillegonda: baptized 8 November 1633;
*Eleanor: baptized 18 February 1635;
*Nicholas: baptized 14 September 1636;
*Susanna: baptized 9 February 1638; and
*Ryckert: baptized 28 June 1639.

Van Wely outlived her husband, having died in Amsterdam in 1670.
Little is known about Van Rensselaer&#x27;s death, and sources even disagree on the year. Van Rensselaer was interred in the Oude Kerk in Amsterdam. His memorial stone states he was buried in the church on 7 October 1643.

==Legacy==
Van Rensselaer&#x27;s son Jeremias was the sole ancestor of the entire Van Rensselaer family in America, and only because of Kiliaen&#x27;s purchase and development of the land in New Netherland. Included in the subsequent family tree is a very powerful and wealthy group of individuals over the course of American history. Within the paternal (Van Rensselaer) lineage, the family has produced numerous New York State Assemblymen and Senators, two Lieutenant Governors of New York, and five Congressmen from New York between 1789 and 1842.

Van Rensselaer is also the source of the names of the town of Rensselaerville, city of Rensselaer, and county of Rensselaer in upstate New York. Additionally, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy was founded in 1824 by Stephen Van Rensselaer III as the Rensselaer School. It is now a world-renowned technical and engineering school. Notably, at the time of his death, Stephen III was worth about $10 million (about $88 billion in 2007 dollars) and is noted as being the tenth-richest American in history.

Rensselaerswyck continued as a legal entity until the mid-1840s, having survived Dutch and British colonial times, even being given a special patent by Queen Anne to confirm the patroon&#x27;s fiefdom upon British takeover of the area. The end of the manor came with the Anti-Rent War, when many tenants rose against the successors of Stephen Van Rensselaer III (who had died in 1839), having much influence on the Legislature elections of the time, and eventually intimidating the Van Rensselaer family enough to sell off most of its holdings.

The family records, many of which were translated and published in the &quot;Van Rensselaer Bowier Manuscripts&quot;, reveal the personality of the man who figures prominently in the history of colonization as the founder of the only successful patroonship that ever existed in New Netherland. But beyond the fact that he managed this patroonship and that he was a merchant and director of the West India Company, practically nothing was known until the organization and translation of the family records in the early 1900s (decade). Current (circa 1990 plus) family members have the surname of Begley.

<text>Robert Gilbert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart, (25 June 1881 – 14 February 1957), known as Sir Robert Vansittart between 1929 and 1941, was a senior British diplomat in the period before and during the Second World War. He was Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister from 1928 to 1930 and Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office from 1930 to 1938 and later served as Chief Diplomatic Adviser to the British Government. He is best remembered for his opposition to appeasement and his strong stance against Germany both during and after the Second World War. His 1941 book, &quot;Black Record: Germans Past and Present&quot;, led to the coining of the term Vansittartism, a doctrine holding that Germans were incorrigibly violent and militaristic throughout their history. Vansittart was also a published poet, novelist and playwright.

==Background and education==
Vansittart was born at Wilton House, Farnham, Surrey, the eldest of the three sons of Robert Arnold Vansittart, of Foots Cray Place, Kent, a Captain in the 7th Dragoon Guards, by his wife Susan Alice Blane, third daughter of Gilbert James Blane, landowner, of Foliejon Park, Berkshire. His younger brother Guy Nicholas (Nick) Vansittart had a successful career with General Motors before and after the war. He was recruited into &quot;Z&quot; Network during the 1930s and served in Special Operations Executive during World War II.

Cognatically (patrilineally) the family is of Dutch descent; ancestors included Arthur Vansittart, Member of Parliament (MP) for Windsor, and the colonel of the same name, MP for Berkshire. Henry Vansittart, Robert Vansittart and Lord Bexley were in the other branches. A female-line ancestor was Lord Auckland. Vansittart was also a second cousin of T. E. Lawrence (better known as Lawrence of Arabia).

Widely nicknamed Van, he was educated at St Neot&#x27;s Preparatory School and Eton College, where he was a member of the exclusive Eton Society (also called Pop) and Captain of the Oppidans. He then travelled in Europe for two years to improve his French and German, where his experiences and study of the political systems prevailing may have contributed to his Germanophobia and Francophilia.

He &quot;appeared to have steppped out of an earlier age&quot; with a lavish lifestyle funded by his wealthy wife, as he had a large house in Mayfair and a magnificent country house in Denham. As a young &quot;attaché&quot; in Paris he wrote a play in French which was performed at the prestigious Theatre Moliere for six weeks.

==Diplomatic career==
Vansittart entered the Foreign Office in 1902, starting as a clerk in the Eastern Department, where he was a specialist on Aegean Islands affairs. He was an &quot;attaché&quot; at the British Embassy in Paris between 1903 and 1905, when he became Third Secretary. He then served at the embassies in Tehran between 1907 and 1909 and Cairo between 1909 and 1911. From 1911, he was attached to the Foreign Office. During the First World War he was joint head of the contraband department and then head of the Prisoner of War Department under Lord Newton. He took part in the Paris Peace Conference and became an Assistant Secretary at the Foreign Office in 1920. From that year to 1924, he was private secretary to the Foreign Secretary, Lord Curzon.

From 1928 to 1930, he was Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin and then Ramsay MacDonald. In January 1930 he was appointed Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office, where he supervised the work of Britain&#x27;s diplomatic service.

===Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, 1930–1938===
Vansittart was suspicious of Adolf Hitler from the start and claimed that what Hitler said was &quot;for foreign consumption&quot;. He thought Hitler would start another European war as soon as he &quot;felt strong enough&quot;.

Vansittart supported revising the Versailles Treaty in Germany&#x27;s favour but only after Hitler was no longer in power. Vansittart believed that Britain should be firm with Germany, with an alliance between France and the Soviet Union against Germany essential. Vansittart also urgently advocated rearmament.

In the summer of 1936, Vansittart visited Germany and claimed that he found a climate that &quot;the ghost of Barthou would hardly have recognised&quot; and that Britain should negotiate with Germany. He thought that satisfying Hitler&#x27;s &quot;land hunger&quot; at Soviet expense would be immoral and regarded the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance as non-negotiable. It was because he believed that Germany had gained equality in Europe that Vansittart favoured facilitating German expansion in Africa. He thought that Hitler was exploiting fears of a &quot;Bolshevist menace&quot; as a cover for &quot;expansion in Central and South-Eastern Europe&quot;.

Like Sir Maurice Hankey, Vansittart thought in power politics terms. He thought Hitler could not decide whether to follow Joseph Goebbels and Alfred von Tirpitz in viewing Britain as &quot;the ultimate enemy&quot; or on the other hand adopting the Joachim von Ribbentrop policy of appeasing Britain in order to engage in military expansion in the East.

Vansittart thought that in either case time should be &quot;bought for rearmament&quot; by an economic agreement with Germany and by appeasing every &quot;genuine grievance&quot; about colonies. Vansittart wanted to detach Benito Mussolini from Hitler and thought that the British Empire was an &quot;Incubus&quot; and that Continental Europe was the central British national interest, but he doubted whether agreement could be had there. That was because he feared that German attention, if turned eastwards, would result in a military empire between the Baltic Sea, the Adriatic Sea and the Black Sea.

At the Foreign Office in the 1930s, Vansittart was a major figure in the loose group of officials and politicians opposed to appeasement of Germany. Eden and Vansittart had already clashed during the Abyssinia Crisis with Eden supporting sanctions against Italy while Vansittart wanted Italy as an ally against Germany. Vansittart argued that there was no prospect of a &quot;general settlement&quot; with Hitler, and the best that could be done was to strengthen ties with the French in order to confront Germany. Vansittart had supported Eden&#x27;s efforts to defuse the Rhineland crisis as British rearmament had only just begun, but Vansittart urged the government to use the crisis as a chance to begin forming a military alliance with France against Germany. By the spring of 1936, Vansittart had become convinced that a &quot;general settlement&quot; with Germany was not possible. A Foreign Office official Owen O&#x27;Malley suggested that Britain give Germany a &quot;free hand in the East&quot; (i.e. accept the German conquest of all Eastern Europe) in exchange for a German promise to accept the status quo in Western Europe. Vansittart wrote in response that Hitler was seeking world conquest, and that to allow Germany to conquer all of Eastern Europe would give the &quot;Reich&quot; sufficient raw materials to make Germany immune to a British blockade, which would then allow the Germans to overrun Western Europe. Vansittart commented that to allow Germany to conquer Eastern Europe would &quot;lead to the disappearance of liberty and democracy in Europe&quot;. By contrast, Eden saw British interests as confined only to Western Europe, and did not share Vansittart&#x27;s beliefs about what Hitler&#x27;s ultimate intentions might be.

In spite of his harsh opposition to appeasement with Germany, Vansittart had been on &quot;very friendly terms with Herr (Konrad) Henlein&quot;. Henlein was the leader of the Sudeten German Party, which demanded autonomy for the Sudetenland, as was eventually achieved through the Munich Agreement (1938). Vansittart genuinely liked Henlein, the mild-mannered and easy-going gymnastics teacher, and believed in assurances that all he wanted was autonomy for the Sudetenland. Much of Vansittart&#x27;s later turn towards Germanphobia was provoked by his discovery that Henlein had deceived him.

Vansittart told Henlein that &quot;no serious intervention in favour of the Czechs was to be feared from Great Britain and probably also from France.&quot; That reached Hitler in the second half of 1937, when he was deciding about his plan to overthrow Austria and Czechoslovakia; his decisions were not proof of high intuition or intellect but were based on information received indirectly from Vansittart, among other well-placed politicians and officers in Britain, like Lord Lothian, Lord Mount Temple, Oliver Vaughan Gurney Hoare (Sir Samuel Hoare&#x27;s younger brother) and others. It is not known how much that encouraged Hitler, but he later stated very similar views: &quot;the Führer believed that almost certainly Britain and probably France as well, had already tacitly written off the Czechs and were reconciled to the fact that this question would be cleared up in due course by Germany.&quot;

After the war, an effort was made to cover up Vansittart&#x27;s embarrassing &quot;real friendship&quot; with Henlein.

In the late 1930s, Vansittart together with Reginald Leeper, the Foreign Office&#x27;s Press Secretary, often leaked information to a private newspaper, &quot;The Whitehall Letter&quot;, edited by Victor Gordon-Lennox, the anti-appeasement diplomatic editor of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;.

That brought him into conflict with the political leadership at the time, and he was removed as Permanent Under-Secretary in 1938 into the &quot;meaningless&quot; role of an advisor (although initially the French and Germans thought it was a promotion). He was out of favour with his former supporter Sir Warren Fisher the head of the civil service and the new head (and confident of Chamberlain and appeaser) Horace Wilson.

A new post as &quot;Chief Diplomatic Adviser to His Majesty&#x27;s Government&quot; was instead created &quot;ad hoc&quot; for him in which he served until 1941.

===Germanophobia===
Vansittart was also involved in intelligence work. In 1940, Vansittart sued the American historian Harry Elmer Barnes for libel for an article, written by Barnes in 1939, accusing him of then plotting aggression against Germany.

During the war, Vansittart became a prominent advocate of a very anti-German line. His earlier worries about Germany were reformulated into an argument that Germany was intrinsically militaristic and aggressive. In &quot;Black Record: Germans Past and Present&quot; (1941), Vansittart portrayed Nazism as just the latest manifestation of Germany&#x27;s continuous record of aggression from the time of the Roman Empire, thus giving rise to the term Vansittartism. Therefore, after Germany was defeated, it must be stripped of all military capacity, including its heavy industries. The German people enthusiastically supported Hitler&#x27;s wars of aggression, just as they had supported the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 and World War I in 1914. They must be thoroughly re-educated under strict Allied supervision for at least a generation. De-Nazification was not enough. The German military elite was the real cause of war, especially the &quot;Prussianist&quot; officer corps and the German General Staff: both must be destroyed.

In 1943 he wrote:

In the opinion of the author, it is an illusion to differentiate between the German right, centre, or left, or the German Catholics or Protestants, or the German workers or capitalists. They are all alike, and the only hope for a peaceful Europe is a crushing and violent military defeat followed by a couple of generations of re-education controlled by the United Nations.

He also wrote that &quot;the other Germany has never existed save in a small and ineffective minority&quot;. On other occasions, he made similar remarks:
We didn&#x27;t go to war in 1939 to save Germany from Hitler ... or the continent from fascism. Like in 1914 we went to war for the not lesser noble cause that we couldn&#x27;t accept a German hegemony over Europe.

The British historian R. B. McCallum wrote in 1944: &quot;To some, such as Lord Vansittart, the main problem of policy was to watch Germany and prevent her power reviving. No one can refuse him a tribute for his foresight in this matter.&quot;

==Honours==
Vansittart was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) in 1906, a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1920, a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1927, a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1929, a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in 1931 and a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in 1938. He was sworn into the Privy Council in 1940 and raised to the peerage as Baron Vansittart, &quot;of Denham in the County of Buckingham&quot; on 3 July 1941.

==Film career==
Vansittart was a close friend of producer Alexander Korda. He helped Korda with the financing of London Films. His barony&#x27;s territorial designation was of Denham, the parish where London Films had its studio and he owned Denham Place. Vansittart contributed to four motion pictures.

He wrote the screenplay for &quot;Wedding Rehearsal&quot; (1932), contributed dialogue to &quot;Sixty Glorious Years&quot; (1938) and, under the pseudonym &quot;Robert Denham&quot;, provided song lyrics for Korda&#x27;s &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; (1940) and &quot;Jungle Book&quot; (1942), in collaboration with the noted Hungarian composer Miklós Rózsa with whom he also wrote the concert musical work for voices, &quot;Beast of Burden&quot; (1940).

==Personal life==
Vansittart married his first wife, Gladys Robinson-Duff (née Heppenheimer), daughter of General William C. Heppenheimer, of the United States, in 1921. They had one daughter, the Honourable Cynthia Vansittart (1922–2023). Gladys died in 1928. He married his second wife, Sarita Enriqueta Ward, daughter of the explorer and sculptor Herbert Ward, of Paris, and widow of Sir Colville Barclay, on 29 July 1931. They lived in London and at Denham Place, Denham, Buckinghamshire. He died in February 1957, age 75, and the barony became extinct.

<text>Rogers Arena is a multi-purpose arena at 800 Griffiths Way in the downtown area of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Opened in 1995, the arena was known as General Motors Place (GM Place) from its opening until July 6, 2010, when General Motors Canada ended its naming rights sponsorship and a new agreement for those rights was reached with Rogers Communications. Rogers Arena was built to replace Pacific Coliseum as Vancouver&#x27;s primary indoor sports facility and in part due to the National Basketball Association (NBA) 1995 expansion into Canada, when Vancouver and Toronto were given expansion teams.

It is home to the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL), and the Vancouver Warriors of the National Lacrosse League (NLL). The arena also hosted the ice hockey events at the 2010 Winter Olympics. The name of the arena temporarily became Canada Hockey Place during the Olympics. It was previously home to the Vancouver Grizzlies of the NBA from 1995 to 2001. The Grizzlies spent six seasons in Vancouver before relocating to Memphis for the 2001–02 season. 

Prior to the start of the 2022–23 NHL season the arena underwent the first of three renovation phases. Phase one consisted of a complete renovation of the players dressing room and team staff area. Phase two was completed prior to the start of the 2023–24 NHL season during which a new centre-hung video board and a new ribbon board above the lower bowl were installed. A new VIP restaurant is being added in between the two tunnels that lead out to the home and away team benches. The final phase was expected to be completed prior to the start of the 2024–25 NHL season, with a replacement of all the seats in the upper and lower bowl of the arena, however this has been delayed to sometime in 2025.

==History==
===GM Place===
The arena was completed in 1995 at a cost of C$160 million in private financing to replace the aging Pacific Coliseum as the main venue for events in Vancouver and to serve as the home arena to the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League and the Vancouver Grizzlies of the National Basketball Association. It was originally named General Motors Place as part of a sponsorship arrangement with General Motors Canada, and was commonly known as &quot;GM Place&quot; or &quot;The Garage&quot;. The arena was also briefly home to the Vancouver Ravens of the National Lacrosse League from 2002 to 2004. The operations of the team have since been suspended although attempts were made to revive the team in 2007 and again in 2008.

The employees of the arena belong to a trade union. In 2007, they chose to change their union affiliation from UNITE HERE – Local 40 to the Christian Labour Association of Canada. After many months of struggle, the British Columbia Labour Relations Board declared the employees choice of a new union. The employee group includes hosts, housekeeping, security and various event staff at the venue. UNITE-HERE local 40 still represented food service workers in the arena, employed by Aramark. Another union protest began in 2009 when GM Place concession workers, cooks and event staff protested their payment. The arena&#x27;s event technical employees are provided through Riggit Services Inc. In the same year, the arena also received a new suspended scoreboard, which at the time was the largest in the NHL.

In February 2010, the arena was used for the ice hockey tournaments at the 2010 Winter Olympics. Canada won both gold medals. The arena was temporarily renamed &quot;Canada Hockey Place&quot; during the Olympics due to regulations regarding corporate sponsorship of event sites.

===Rogers Arena===
On July 6, 2010, it was announced that GM had declined to renew the naming rights, and that Rogers Communications had acquired the naming rights under a 10-year deal, under which it was renamed Rogers Arena. The following year, the arena reached a five-year sponsorship deal with PepsiCo, under which it became the exclusive provider of beverages and snacks at Rogers Arena, and gained sponsorship placements. In addition, all concerts held at Rogers Arena promote the venue as Pepsi Live at Rogers Arena.

In October 2010, prior to the 2010–11 Vancouver Canucks season. Canucks Sports &amp; Entertainment installed four-storey high theatrical screens, and 16 projectors were installed. It was the first setup of its kind in North American sports. Last time they were used was during the 2015–16 Vancouver Canucks season. They are still present inside the Arena; however, it is unknown when they will be ever used again.

In July 2012, Aquilini Investment Group had originally planned to build the towers with condo units. The switch to rental units provides the city with much-needed rental space. However, the city lost about $35 million in developer contributions to community facilities in the Northeast False Creek area that would have been collected if the buildings had been condos. As of June 2016, the first tower is completed, with the second tower nearing completion.

<doc id="754081" wikidata="Q1139489" url="?curid=754081" title="Northlands Coliseum">
<text>Northlands Coliseum is a defunct indoor arena in Edmonton, Alberta. It was used for sports events and concerts, and was home to the Edmonton Oilers of the World Hockey Association (WHA) and National Hockey League (NHL), and the Edmonton Oil Kings of the Western Hockey League (WHL). The arena opened in 1974, and was later known as Edmonton Coliseum, Skyreach Centre, and Rexall Place, before returning to the Northlands Coliseum name in summer 2016.

The arena hosted the 1981 and 1984 Canada Cup hockey tournaments, the 1978 Commonwealth Games, seven Stanley Cup finals (Oilers losses in 1983 and 2006, and Oilers victories in 1984, 1985, 1987, 1988, and 1990), many other hockey events, along with other sporting events and major concerts.

The final NHL game played at the arena was on April 6, 2016. The building closed on New Year&#x27;s Day 2018, after ownership of the facility was transferred from Northlands to the City of Edmonton. Northlands had planned to re-develop the arena into a multi-level ice facility, but these plans were scrapped after it was found that renovating the facility would be more costly than building a new one altogether.

The venue is now in the process of being dismantled, which is expected to take an extended period of time due to the presence of hazardous substances such as lead and asbestos. Final demolition of the building is not expected to be completed until 2025 at the earliest.

==History==

The Coliseum opened in 1974 as a replacement for the aging Edmonton Gardens. While the Edmonton Oilers&#x27; ownership group, including Charles Allard, had initially pursued to construct their own arena, they backtracked and partnered with the Edmonton Exhibition Association (EEA, now Northlands)—the non-profit operator of Edmonton Gardens—after they expressed concern that Allard&#x27;s proposed arena would &quot;greatly impact and damage&quot; the organization. The Association and others had made proposals for a downtown arena to replace Edmonton Gardens, but referendums on the matter were struck down by voters.

The 16,000-seat arena used the same architect and plans as Vancouver&#x27;s Pacific Coliseum. A crane was placed on a circular track to help speed up construction. The final months of construction process in 1974 hit several setbacks, including strikes by steelworkers, cement workers, and elevator workers, and the last batch of 5,000 seats arriving only shortly before its inaugural event—the Oilers&#x27; home opener on November 10, 1974, against the Cleveland Crusaders. After its first game, the Coliseum received positive reviews by visitors and sportswriters. The EEA held an official grand opening event open July 1, 1975.

By the early-1990s, the Coliseum had begun to lag behind newer NHL arenas in terms of amenities such as luxury boxes. Amid financial turmoil, including the team having signed away multiple star players (such as Wayne Gretzky), team owner Peter Pocklington threatened to re-locate the Oilers unless he was given full control of the Coliseum and all of its revenue, and could build luxury boxes in the arena. In 1994, he reached a rent agreement with Northlands valued at $2.8 million per-year. The agreement contained clauses requiring the Oilers to remain in Edmonton for 10 years, and requiring that the team be offered to local investors for a fixed price of US$70 million within 30 days if a current or proposed owner announces an intent to re-locate the team.

In 1997, a proposed sale to Leslie Alexander triggered the clause, resulting in the Edmonton Investors Group (EIG) being formed to purchase the team. Northlands regained control of the Coliseum, with the Oilers agreeing to pay operational costs and $1 in rent per-year, in exchange for being able to receive revenue from hockey games and designated parking spots at the arena, and being able to sell naming rights. In October 1998, the Coliseum was renamed Skyreach Centre after a naming rights agreement with Skyreach Equipment.

In November 2003, the naming rights were acquired by the pharmacy chain Rexall, under which it was renamed Rexall Place. The chain&#x27;s then-parent Katz Group later purchased the Oilers and the Oil Kings.
Before the 2007–08 season started, the Oilers dressing room underwent a $3.5 million renovation. The room was widened, adding a new medical room, lounge, bar, video room, weight room as well as other new facilities.

===Replacement by Rogers Place, closure and demolition plans===

Given the age and small size of the Coliseum (which was second-oldest and third-smallest arena in the NHL as of 2015), the construction of a new arena for the Edmonton Oilers was proposed by the Katz Group in 2010. An agreement was reached in January 2012 between the Katz Group and the City of Edmonton for the construction of Rogers Place in downtown Edmonton. Construction started in March 2014, and it opened in September 2016 with a seating capacity of 18,347.

The Oilers&#x27; final game at Rexall Place was played on April 6, 2016, against the Vancouver Canucks. The Oilers won 6–2; the last NHL goal was scored by Oiler Leon Draisaitl. A post-game ceremony was held, featuring current and past Oilers players. Northlands said that the old arena would remain open, and a number of concerts and sporting events were still held there even after the Oilers left.

On February 17, 2016, Northlands unveiled plans to convert Northlands Coliseum into a multi-level ice facility, with a later proposal calling for a partnership with Hockey Canada to make it a Hockey Canada Centre of Excellence, but it was later discovered that renovating the Coliseum would be more costly than building a new facility.

As more major concerts and other events were drawn away to Rogers Place, Northlands experienced declines in revenue. This made it difficult for the non-profit organization to pay off a loan by the City that was used to fund the 2009 expansion of the Edmonton Expo Centre. On September 13, 2017, the City of Edmonton reached an agreement to take over the arena from Northlands effective January 1, 2018 (the same date that control of the Edmonton Expo Centre transferred to the Edmonton Economic Development Corporation under a similar agreement), as it prepared to transition to primarily being an agricultural organization. The venue permanently ceased operations on that date; Oilers Entertainment Group also agreed to release the city from a $17 million (out of $20 million) sponsorship agreement.

Despite other proposals from parties wanting to convert the Coliseum to a sports and recreation facility, the master agreement between Oilers Entertainment Group and the city of Edmonton prohibited the city from making any further investments in the building, nor did it allow use as a sports or entertainment facility. Plans to repurpose the Northlands site proposed the demolition of the Coliseum.

On December 12, 2022, in light of the $1.5 million annual cost to upkeep the empty building in its form since its closure at the end of 2017, and the lack of ability to repurpose the structure, Edmonton City Council voted to demolish the Northlands Coliseum at a cost of $35 million over four years, with no projected start date.

==Arena information==

The official capacity for hockey when the arena closed was 16,839, which was slightly less than the 17,100 the arena held before the 2001–02 NHL season. It was one of three NHL arenas (the others being the MTS Centre in Winnipeg and Barclays Center in Brooklyn) seating less than 17,000 fans in its configuration. When it opened, the capacity was 15,423, but it was increased to 17,490 after the Oilers joined the NHL by adding an extra tier of seating on the side opposite the press box. This was increased to 17,498 in 1982 and to 17,503 in 1986. The arena underwent an extensive renovation in 1994 in which the seating capacity was reduced to make way for 52 luxury suites. 15 more suites were added in 2001. The arena could also be noisy, as noise levels reached 119 decibels during playoff games.

Northlands Coliseum was the first NHL arena in Canada to have a centre-hung scoreboard with an electronic message board; the original scoreboard including a black-and-white dot matrix board. This was replaced in 1987 by a centre-hung scoreboard with a colour matrix screen, which in 1994 was replaced with an eight-sided scoreboard with four video screens. The last centre-hung scoreboard, designed by White Way Sign, featured eight message boards at the top and four video screens at the bottom, separated by LED rings. The arena also featured 360-degree fascia signage by Daktronics.

The Coliseum was the last NHL arena with the player benches on the same side as the TV cameras. In all other NHL venues, the TV cameras are on the same side as the scorekeepers table and penalty boxes.

<doc id="754086" wikidata="Q6530996" url="?curid=754086" title="Murder of Leslie Mahaffy">
<text>Leslie Erin Mahaffy (July 5, 1976 – June 16, 1991) was the second Canadian murder victim of killers Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka. At the time of her death, she was a resident of Burlington, Ontario, and a Grade 9 student at M.M. Robinson High School. 

Mahaffy&#x27;s kidnapping was one in a series of disappearances of Ontario schoolgirls in the early 1990s, including Kristen French, also a victim of Bernardo and Homolka. Prior to killing Mahaffy in 1991 and French in 1992, the pair had raped and killed Homolka&#x27;s teenage sister Tammy in 1990. The disappearances, arrests, and convictions were widely covered in Canadian media, becoming one of the most notorious crimes in Canadian history.

==Family==

Leslie Erin Mahaffy was born on July 5, 1976. Her brother Ryan was born some years later. Her father was an oceanographer for the Canadian federal Fisheries and Oceans department and sometimes would be on assignments away from home for weeks at a time. Her mother was a teacher.

As she grew older, Mahaffy began to spend periods of time away from the family home but always phoned home during her absences and kept in touch with her younger brother Ryan, with whom she was very close. Shortly before her abduction, some friends had been killed in a car accident. The evening prior to her abduction, Leslie attended a memorial for one of the teens as well as an informal get-together and subsequently missed her Friday night curfew. Finding the door locked, Leslie traveled to a nearby plaza to use the pay telephone to ask a friend if she might spend the night at the friend&#x27;s home but was refused. Returning home, she crossed paths with Bernardo who had been out looking into backyards, hoping to find a victim. Bernardo lured Leslie back to his nearby car and took her to the house he shared with Homolka. Later that day, Leslie&#x27;s friend telephoned the Mahaffy house to inquire about Leslie&#x27;s well-being and explained the call that Leslie had made after discovering that she had been locked out, prompting Leslie&#x27;s mother to start searching for Leslie. Finding no trace of her daughter, she eventually became concerned and contacted the police. When Mahaffy failed to phone home on her own birthday about two weeks later, her family was certain that she had not called them because she could not.

Her mother Debbie would later become prominent in the struggle to maintain and enforce the judge&#x27;s gag order about the trials of Mahaffy&#x27;s killers and the videotapes they made of their own crimes, which were used as evidence against them.

Mahaffy&#x27;s remains are interred under a family headstone at Burlington Memorial Gardens in Burlington, Ontario, Canada. There is also a heart-shaped garden with a plaque in Leslie&#x27;s honor at M.M. Robinson High School and a memorial bench close to her family headstone.

==Kidnapping==

At the time of her abduction and subsequent murder in mid-June 1991, a few weeks before her fifteenth birthday, Leslie Mahaffy was a Grade 9 student at M.M. Robinson High School in Burlington. Like many teens that age, she wore braces on her teeth.

On the evening of June 14, 1991, Mahaffy went to a funeral home to attend a wake for her friend Chris Evans, a boy who had died in a car accident earlier that week.

After the wake, a large group of teens met in the woods to drink and console one another. As the evening wound down, a couple of friends walked her home shortly before 2:00 am, where they stayed with her while she found the side door locked. She told them the front door would surely be unlocked, and sent them home. After they left her, she found the front door was locked as well.

Now alone, Mahaffy walked to a pay phone at Mac&#x27;s Milk and called a friend&#x27;s house for permission to sleep over. Her friend told her no, and after a lengthy conversation that ended after 2:30 am, Mahaffy said she would go back home and wake up her own mother to get in the house.

When Mahaffy failed to appear later that day at the funerals for her friend Chris Evans and the three teens killed with him, her mother phoned the police. On June 18, Debbie Mahaffy filed the official paperwork to have her daughter sought and arrested as a runaway.

Paul Bernardo eventually admitted he had been on Keller Court, where the Mahaffy home was located, to steal license plates. He saw Leslie Mahaffy alone. He claims he told her he was breaking into the house next door and then offered her a cigarette, which he said was back at his car. When she was close enough to the car, he said he wrapped his sweatshirt quickly around her head, forced her into the vehicle, and took her to the home he shared with Homolka. Homolka&#x27;s version of the story is similar, but she claims that once he got Mahaffy to the car to fetch the cigarette, he pulled a knife on the girl to get her compliance. Both agree that Homolka was not present during the kidnapping.

==Murder==
The next 24 hours were spent with Bernardo and Homolka raping and abusing Mahaffy. Both killers agree that they gave her a teddy bear to hold during breaks between assaults. She was murdered sometime on June 15, 1991. According to Homolka, Bernardo strangled Mahaffy with an electrical cord a second time when the first attempt left her unconscious for a few minutes. Homolka, a veterinary technician, had access to sedative drugs which were used to subdue Mahaffy, the same technique the pair used in the rape and inadvertent murder of Homolka&#x27;s sister six months before.

Bernardo stated that he was out of the room, preparing the car to transport Mahaffy to a location where she would be released, when the heavily-drugged Mahaffy died. He has claimed he did not even know she was dead until, after putting gas in the car and taking a shower, he tried to pick her up to carry her away. He said he and Homolka panicked, and that he tried to give Mahaffy artificial respiration. 

On June 16, 1991, Bernardo and Homolka moved Mahaffy&#x27;s body from an upstairs bedroom to the basement. During this time, Bernardo and Homolka hosted Homolka&#x27;s family for a Father&#x27;s Day dinner on the main floor of the house, with Homolka making a special effort to keep her mother from going downstairs. When the family left, Bernardo and Homolka used his grandfather&#x27;s circular saw to dismember Mahaffy&#x27;s body into pieces small enough to lift when covered with concrete. Later, in a confession to her aunt before revealing details to the police, Homolka claimed that Bernardo did this while she was at work on Monday. Bernardo&#x27;s version asserts that she did not help him rinse and bag the body parts.

Mahaffy&#x27;s body was found dismembered and encased in concrete on June 29, 1991, in Lake Gibson near St. Catharines, Ontario. The concrete block containing the torso weighed over 200 pounds. Her braces and dental records confirmed her identity.

Investigators immediately believed she had been raped and tortured. This was confirmed when videotapes were discovered in the home of Bernardo and Homolka. The tapes show that she was held hostage for approximately 24 hours and repeatedly assaulted and sodomized. After Bernardo&#x27;s final bid for an appeal before the Supreme Court was rejected, the tapes were all destroyed by the Ontario government.

===Bernardo&#x27;s 2005 statements===
Several days before Homolka&#x27;s release from prison in 2005, Bernardo was interviewed by police and his lawyer, Tony Bryant. Bryant was subsequently interviewed by the media, providing Bernardo&#x27;s thoughts about the release.

According to Bryant, Bernardo claimed that he had always intended to free the girls he and Homolka had held captive. Bernardo claimed that Homolka was worried that Leslie Mahaffy&#x27;s blindfold had fallen off and that she would be able to identify them. Further, Bernardo claimed that Homolka&#x27;s plan was to murder Mahaffy by injecting an air bubble into her bloodstream, eventually causing an embolism.

<doc id="754089" wikidata="Q338489" url="?curid=754089" title="Accademia della Crusca">
<text>The  (; ), generally abbreviated as La Crusca, is a Florence-based society of scholars of Italian linguistics and philology. It is one of the most important research institutions of the Italian language, as well as the oldest linguistic academy in the world.

The &quot;Accademia&quot; was founded in Florence in 1583, and has since been characterized by its efforts to maintain the purity of the Italian language. &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;bran&quot; in Italian, helps convey the metaphor that its work is similar to winnowing, as also does its emblem depicting a sifter for straining out corrupt words and structures (as bran is separated from wheat). The academy motto is &quot;Il più bel fior ne coglie&quot; (&#x27;She gathers the fairest flower&#x27;), a famous line by the Italian poet Petrarch. In 1612, the &quot;Accademia&quot; published the first edition of its dictionary, the &quot;Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca&quot;, which has served as the model for similar works in French, Spanish, German and English.

The academy is a member of the European Federation of National Linguistic Institutes.

The founders were originally called the and constituted a circle composed of poets, men of letters, and lawyers. The members usually assembled on pleasant and convivial occasions, during which —discourses in a merry and playful style, which have neither a beginning nor an end—were recited. The Crusconi used humour, satire, and irony to distance itself from the pedantry of the Accademia Fiorentina, protected by Grand Duke Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, and to contrast itself with the severe and classic style of that body. This battle was fought without compromising the primary intention of the group, which was typically literary, and expounded in high-quality literary disputes.

The founders of the are traditionally identified as Giovanni Battista Deti (&#x27;Sollo&#x27;), Antonio Francesco Grazzini (&#x27;Lasca&#x27;), Bernardo Canigiani (&#x27;Gramolato&#x27;), Bernardo Zanchini (&#x27;Macerato&#x27;), Bastiano de&#x27; Rossi (&#x27;Inferigno&#x27;); they were joined in October 1582 by Lionardo Salviati (&#x27;Infarinato&#x27;) (1540–1589). Under his leadership, at the beginning of 1583, the Accademia took on a new form, directing itself to demonstrate and to conserve the beauty of the Florentine vulgar tongue, modelled upon the authors of the Trecento.

=== Monosini and the first Vocabolario ===
One of the earliest scholars to influence the work of the Crusca was Agnolo Monosini. He contributed greatly to the 1612 edition of &quot;Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca&quot;, especially with regard to the influence of Greek, which, he maintained, made a significant contribution to the Fiorentine idiom of the period.

The Accademia thus abandoned the jocular character of its earlier meetings in order to take up the normative role it would assume from then on. The very title of the Accademia came to be interpreted in a new way: the academicians of the Crusca would now work to distinguish the good and pure part of the language (the &quot;farina&quot;, or whole wheat) from the bad and impure part (the &quot;crusca&quot;, or bran). From this is derived the symbolism of the Crusca: its logo shows a &quot;frullone&quot; or sifter with the Petrarchan motto &quot;Il più bel fior ne coglie&quot; (She gathers the fairest flower). The members of the Accademia were given nicknames associated with corn and flour, and seats in the form of breadbaskets with backs in the shape of bread shovel were used for their meetings.

In 1636, Cardinal Richelieu created the on the model of the .

=== Beccaria and Verri opposition ===
The linguistic purism of the Accademia found opposition in Cesare Beccaria and the Verri brothers (Pietro and Alessandro), who through their journal &quot;Il Caffè&quot; systematically attacked the Accademia&#x27;s archaisms as pedantic, denouncing the Accademia while invoking for contrast no less than the likes of Galileo and Newton and even modern intellectual cosmopolitanism itself. However, since Galileo published his scientific works in his native Florentine Italian, as opposed to the Latin which was customary for academic works of the time, it has also been argued that he implicitly supported the Accademia&#x27;s purpose.

=== Baroque period ===
The Accademia&#x27;s activities carried on with both high and low points until 1783, when Pietro Leopoldo quit and, with several other academicians, created the second Accademia Fiorentina. In 1808, however, the third Accademia Fiorentina was founded and, by a decree of 19 January 1811, signed by Napoleon, the Crusca was re-established with its own status of autonomy, statutes and previous aims.

In the 20th century, the decree of 11 March 1923 changed its composition and its purpose. The compilation of the &quot;Vocabolario&quot;, hitherto the duty of the Crusca, was removed from it and passed to a private society of scholars; the Crusca was entrusted with the compilation of philological texts. In 1955, however, Bruno Migliorini and others began discussion of the return of the work of preparing the &quot; Vocabolario&quot; to the Crusca.

=== In recent years ===

In 2007, the website E-leo compiling 3,000 drawings and writings of Leonardo da Vinci was launched, with the linguistic help of the to decipher some of the inventor&#x27;s scribblings.

In August 2011, the existence of the Accademia was threatened when Giulio Tremonti and Silvio Berlusconi introduced a proposition to eradicate all public-funded entities with less than 70 members. In August 2015, the Accademia&#x27;s website was defaced by a hacker linked to ISIS.

In February 2016, the Accademia approved the submission of an 8-year old for the new Italian word &quot;petaloso&quot; (full of petals).

<doc id="754092" wikidata="Q2156376" url="?curid=754092" title="Robert Anderson Van Wyck">
<text>Robert Anderson Van Wyck ( ; July 20, 1849 – November 14, 1918) was the first mayor of New York City after the consolidation of the five boroughs into the City of Greater New York in 1898.

==Early life and education==
Robert Anderson Van Wyck was the son of William Van Wyck and Lydia Ann Maverick. He was one of seven children, including two brothers Augustus and Samuel Maverick, a Confederate Regimental Surgeon. He studied at the Wilson Academy in North Carolina, and later graduated from Columbia University, where he was valedictorian of his class. His sister Lydia married Robert Hoke of North Carolina, a Confederate general during the American Civil War and businessman.

==Career==
Van Wyck began working in business, then studied law and became an attorney. He enjoyed a large practice for many years before entering politics.

His business life depended on his social connections as well. Van Wyck was a member of the Holland Society, of which he became president. He belonged to many of the social clubs of the city and was prominent in Masonic circles, being a member of The Ancient Lodge, New York City.

==Political career==
For many years Van Wyck took an active interest in Democratic Party matters, attending many conventions, state and national. Later, Van Wyck was elected Judge of the City Court of New York. He advanced to chief justice.

Van Wyck resigned as justice to accept the Democratic Party nomination for Mayor of New York City. He was elected in 1897 by a very large majority. He served as mayor of New York City between 1898 and 1901, as the first mayor to govern New York City after its five boroughs had been consolidated into a single city.

As Mayor, he brought together the innumerable municipal corporations comprising the greater city. He directed construction of the Interborough Rapid Transit&#x27;s first subway in Manhattan.

Van Wyck is generally regarded as selected by the leaders of Tammany Hall as a man who would do little to interfere with their running of the city. Initially highly popular as a result of his reversal of the various reforms introduced by the preceding Fusion administration, Van Wyck&#x27;s administration foundered on the so-called &quot;Ice Trust&quot; scandal of 1900. The &quot;New York World&quot; reported that the American Ice Company of Charles W. Morse planned to double the price of ice, from 30 to 60 cents per hundred pounds (from 66 cents to 1.32 dollars per 100 kilograms). In the era before refrigeration, this had potentially fatal effects, as the ice was the only preservative available to keep food, milk, and medicines fresh. The high price would have put ice beyond the reach of many of the city&#x27;s poor—Tammany&#x27;s main power base in the years of waves of immigration.

American Ice was forced to reverse its decision due to the public outcry. Van Wyck&#x27;s political rivals forced an investigation into the issue. It revealed that American Ice had secured an effective monopoly over the supply of its product to the city—it was the only company with rights to land ice at New York piers—and would have dramatically increased its profits at the new price. In addition, Van Wyck, whose salary as mayor was only $15,000, owned and had apparently not paid for, $680,000 worth of American Ice stock.

The Ice Trust Scandal destroyed Van Wyck&#x27;s political career and was generally reckoned to have cost Tammany the elections of 1901, which was won by the Fusion reformist slate led by Seth Low. Two years later, &quot;The New York Times&quot; characterized the Van Wyck administration as one mired in &quot;black ooze and slime&quot;. Governor Theodore Roosevelt initiated an investigation, which determined that Van Wyck had not been personally implicated in the Ice Trust Scandal.

==Later years==
Van Wyck and his wife enjoyed traveling. In 1906, they moved to Paris, France. He died there at the age of 69 on November 14, 1918. The funeral was held at American Holy Trinity Church. His body was returned to New York and he was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

<doc id="754102" wikidata="Q1435724" url="?curid=754102" title="List of historical states of Italy">
<text>Italy, up until its unification in 1861, was a conglomeration of city-states, republics, and other independent entities. The following is a list of the various Italian states during that period. Following the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the arrival of the Middle Ages (in particular from the 11th century), the Italian Peninsula was divided into numerous states. Many of these states consolidated into major political units that balanced the power on the Italian Peninsula: the Papal States, the Venetian Republic, the Republic of Florence, the Duchy of Milan, the Kingdom of Naples and the Kingdom of Sicily. Unlike all the other Italian states of the medieval and early modern period, the republics of Venice and Genoa, thanks to their maritime power, went beyond territorial conquests within the Italian Peninsula, conquering various regions across the Mediterranean and Black Seas.

==Ancient Italy==

==After the Italian Wars==

The Peace of Cateau Cambrésis ended the Italian Wars in 1559. The kingdoms of Sicily, Sardinia, Naples (inclusive of the State of Presidi) and the Duchy of Milan were left under the control of Spanish Habsburgs. France was in control of several fortresses and in particular of the Marquisate of Saluzzo. All the other Italian states remained independent, with the most powerful being the Venetian Republic, the Medici&#x27;s Duchy of Tuscany, the Savoyard state, the Republic of Genoa, and the Papal States. The Gonzaga in Mantua, the Este in Modena and Ferrara and the Farnese in Parma and Piacenza continued to be important dynasties. Parts of the north of Italy remained a part of the Holy Roman Empire.

==After the Wars of Succession of the 18th century==
During the war of the Spanish succession (1700-1714), Savoy acquired Sicily, while the remaining Spanish dominions in Italy (Naples, Sardinia, and Milan) were taken over by the Austrian Habsburgs. In 1720, Savoy exchanged Sicily for Sardinia. Following the extinction of the House of Medici, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany was ruled by the Habsburg-Lorraine. Later on, Southern Italy passed to a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon, known as House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. Other states such as Genoa, Venice, Modena, the Papal States and Lucca remained with their governments unchanged.

==From the restoration to the unification==

Following the defeat of Napoleon&#x27;s France, the Congress of Vienna (1815) was convened to redraw the European continent. In Italy, the Congress restored the pre-Napoleonic patchwork of independent governments, either directly ruled or strongly influenced by the prevailing European powers, particularly Austria. The Congress also determined the end of two millenary republics: Genoa was annexed by the then Savoyard Kingdom of Sardinia, and Venice was incorporated with Milan into a new kingdom of the Austrian Empire.

At the time, the struggle for Italian unification was perceived to be waged primarily against the Habsburgs, since they directly controlled the predominantly Italian-speaking northeastern part of present-day Italy and were the most powerful force against the Italian unification. The Austrian Empire vigorously repressed nationalist sentiment growing in its domains on the Italian Peninsula, as well as in the other parts of Habsburg domains.

<doc id="754108" wikidata="Q6800372" url="?curid=754108" title="McCloud River">
<text>The McCloud River is a long river that flows east of and parallel to the upper Sacramento River, in Siskiyou County and Shasta County in northern California in the United States. Protected under California&#x27;s Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (1972), it drains a scenic mountainous area of the Cascade Range, including part of Mount Shasta. It is a tributary of the Pit River, which in turn flows into the Sacramento River. The three rivers join in Shasta Lake, formed by Shasta Dam north of Redding.

==History==
The river was originally known as the &quot;McLeod River&quot;, after the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company hunter and trapper Alexander Roderick McLeod who explored it during the winter of 1829-1830. By the 1860s, the spelling &quot;McCloud&quot; was widely used, likely because that was the conventional American spelling of the Scottish name, and perhaps in part to honor California pioneer Ross McCloud, who settled there in 1855.

==Geography==
The McCloud River watershed drains . It rises from several spring-fed streams in Colby Meadows in the Cascades approximately southeast of Mount Shasta in Siskiyou County. It flows initially west, passing south of Mount Shasta and receiving streams that drain the southern slope of the peak. East of McCloud it forms a series of waterfalls which tumble over basaltic lava flows, known collectively as the McCloud River Falls or Falls of the McCloud River.

Below the falls the river flows generally south-southwest through the Lake McCloud reservoir and through a deep canyon in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. It joins Shasta Lake, formed by the Shasta Dam, approximately north of Redding, with the lower of the river forming the middle arm of the lake. The McCloud arm joins the Pit River arm just east of the Pit River Bridge on Interstate 5, north of the city of Shasta Lake.

Major tributaries to the Upper McCloud River include Mud and Tate Creeks (plus Big Springs). Squaw Valley, Hawkins, Claiborne, and Chatterdown Creeks are the major tributaries to the McCloud River below McCloud Reservoir.

==River modifications==
The river is dammed at McCloud River Dam, to provide water for the McCloud-Pit Hydroelectric Project. The McCloud Tunnel diverts water from the McCloud River east to Iron Canyon Reservoir; the water is discharged into the Pit River at James B. Black Powerhouse. Further downstream, the diverted water boosts power generation at Pit 6 and Pit 7 Dams before flowing into Shasta Lake. The overall generating capacity is 364 megawatts. Built in the late 1960s, the system is owned and operated by PG&amp;E.

As a consequence of damming, the average flow in the lower McCloud River declined greatly, from an annual mean of between 1946 and 1965 to an annual mean of between 1967 and 2013. The greatest impact on river flow is during the summer months when the dam release is only . However, there is little impact on winter peak flows, which mostly originate in the watershed area below the dam.

==Recreation==
The McCloud is generally divided into two sections. The Upper McCloud is considered to be above McCloud Reservoir, and the Lower McCloud stretches from the reservoir to Lake Shasta. The waterfalls mentioned above are all found on the Upper McCloud. The Upper McCloud is a popular destination for kayakers. There is an improved campground called Fowlers on the Upper McCloud. The Upper McCloud above Upper Falls is rarely stocked, and locating the fish often proves to be a challenge to most avid anglers, while the section from Lower Falls to Upper Falls is stocked and is open to bait fishing. The Lower McCloud is generally a fly/artificial lure fishery and catch and release fishing is greatly encouraged.

The last several miles of the McCloud comprise two private fishing clubs — the McCloud River Club () and the Bollibokka Club (), founded in 1902 and 1904, respectively. The land encompassing the lower of Bollibokka Club was purchased in 2007 by the Westlands Water District, which continues to operate the historic Bollibokka Club. Westlands purchased the property to avoid risk of development of the property, to increase its entitlement to water releases from Shasta reservoir through ownership of in the watershed, and to quell opposition to plans for increases in the height of Shasta Dam, a project in which it is the largest stakeholder. The upper of the club&#x27;s river holdings were purchased in 2006 by Silicon Valley real estate magnate John Arrillaga. Anglers are not allowed to set foot above the high water mark on either property. The Nature Conservancy has a site on the Lower McCloud, an outright gift from the neighboring McCloud River Club, that allows ten rods per day and unlimited hikers or birders.

There are two campgrounds on the Lower McCloud River — Ash Camp and Ah Di Nah Campground. Ash Camp is a small unimproved camp area about downstream of the McCloud Reservoir dam with 4 sites and a vault toilet. It sits at the junction of Hawkins Creek and the Lower McCloud.

While Ah Di Nah Campground is located only further downstream from Ash Camp, it is about of dirt road driving to get there. It is a Shasta-Trinity National Forest campground and a fee is charged for nightly camping. Ah Di Nah is popular with backpackers and anglers for its proximity to the Pacific Crest Trail and the Nature Conservancy area on the McCloud River. Bathrooms and water are available.

==Ecology==
The McCloud once hosted a native population of bull trout (&quot;Salvelinus confluentus&quot;), but the species became extinct in the McCloud watershed after McCloud Reservoir cut off the fish from their spawning grounds. The last reported Bull trout (misidentified as Dolly Varden trout (&quot;Salvelinus malma&quot;) at that time, Dollys are not from this southern latitude) was caught in the 1980s.

The Upper McCloud and its tributaries above Middle Falls are home to the McCloud River redband (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss stonei&quot;), a native subspecies of rainbow trout. These redband trout were proposed for endangered species status, as their genetics have been introgressed by hybridization with hatchery stocked rainbow trout. The Falls of the McCloud River form a natural barrier to rainbow trout migration historically. An amplified fragment length polymorphism study show Sheepheaven Creek (the type specimen) genetics to be sufficiently different to warrant subspecific status. Conservation efforts have included transplanting the relative pure Sheepheaven Creek strain into Swamp and Trout Creeks.

== Threats ==
The McCloud ecosystem faces threats to the various cultural sites along the river and the general river ecosystem health. In November 2020, the Trump Administration under the direction of then U.S. Secretary of the Interior, David Bernhardt, approved plans to increase the nearby Shasta Dam by 18.5 feet. The consequences would include the flooding of 5,000 acres of the local habitat which would harm the wild trout fishery as well as introduce permanent and seasonal flooding of roughly 39 sacred Winnemem Wintu Tribe sites that are located along the McCloud River. 

The river system is closely tied to the Winnemem Wintu Tribe&#x27;s culture as the tribe once lived in the greater Siskiyou Region and depended greatly on the river as a source of food and a setting for cultural ceremonies. In 1945, the completion of the Shasta Dam on the Sacramento River harmed the river&#x27;s salmon population. It also led to the flooding of 95% of Winnemem Wintu territory, this included about 250 cultural sites, such as burial sites, and whole villages. The Central Valley Project Land Acquisition Act of 1941 had issued portions of over 4,000 acres of land in order to recompense tribal territories that were flooded and damaged. However, the U.S. Federal Government failed to deliver compensation and instead created a cemetery for the 183 Winnemem Wintu bodies that were displaced from their burial sites along the McCloud.

<text>The Spectrum (later known as CoreStates Spectrum, First Union Spectrum and Wachovia Spectrum) was an indoor arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The arena opened in September 1967 as part of what is now known as the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. After several expansions of its seating capacity, it accommodated 18,168 for basketball and 17,380 for ice hockey, arena football, indoor soccer, and box lacrosse.

The final event at the Spectrum was a Pearl Jam concert on October 31, 2009. The arena was demolished between November 2010 and May 2011.

==History==
Opened as the Spectrum in September 1967, Philadelphia&#x27;s first modern indoor sports arena was built to be the home of the expansion Philadelphia Flyers of the NHL, and also to accommodate the existing Philadelphia 76ers of the NBA. The building was the second major sports facility built at the south end of Broad Street in an area previously known as East League Island Park and now referred to simply as the South Philadelphia Sports Complex.

===Early years===
Ground was broken on the arena on June 1, 1966, by Jerry Wolman and then-Philadelphia Mayor James Tate as the home of the NHL&#x27;s expansion Philadelphia Flyers. The first event at the arena was the Quaker City Jazz Festival on September 30, 1967, produced by Larry Magid.

The first sporting event at the arena was an October 17, 1967 boxing match featuring Joe Frazier vs. Tony Doyle. From 1967 through 1972, fifteen fight cards were held at the Spectrum. The NBA&#x27;s 76ers also moved there from Convention Hall as a second major league sports tenant. Lou Scheinfeld, former President of the Spectrum, explained that the name &quot;Spectrum&quot; was selected to evoke the broad range of events to be held there: &quot;The &#x27;SP&#x27; for &#x27;sports&#x27; and &#x27;South Philadelphia&#x27;, &#x27;E&#x27; for &#x27;entertainment&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27; for &#x27;circuses&#x27;, &#x27;T&#x27; for &#x27;theatricals&#x27;, &#x27;R&#x27; for &#x27;recreation&#x27;, and &#x27;UM&#x27; as &#x27;um, what a nice building!&#x27;&quot; Scheinfeld also said that a seat in the city&#x27;s first superbox initially cost $1,000 a year: &quot;For every Flyers game, Sixers game, circus, you name it, you got 250 events for $1,000.&quot; The Flyers won their first ever home game in this arena by defeating the Pittsburgh Penguins, 1–0. Bill Sutherland scored the arena&#x27;s first goal.

On March 1, 1968, wind blew part of the covering off the Spectrum&#x27;s roof during a performance of the Ice Capades, forcing the building to close for a month while Mayor Tate fought with then-Philadelphia County District Attorney Arlen Specter over responsibility for the construction of the roof, and the damage was repaired. The 76ers moved their home games to Convention Hall and to the Palestra, but neither of those arenas had ice rinks at the time, and there were no other NHL-quality sites in the Philadelphia area. The Flyers hurriedly moved their next home game against the Oakland Seals to Madison Square Garden in New York followed by a meeting with the Boston Bruins played at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto before establishing a base at Le Colisée in Quebec City, home of their top minor league team, the AHL Quebec Aces, for the remainder of their regular season, marking the first NHL games in Quebec City in over four decades, and years before the Quebec Nordiques joined the NHL. The roof was repaired in time to permit the Flyers to return to the Spectrum to open their first Stanley Cup playoffs against the St. Louis Blues on April 4, 1968; the opening faceoff came just as the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. was transpiring in Memphis, Tennessee. Similarly, in 1993, the Flyers played a day game against the Los Angeles Kings during a blizzard. A piece of flying debris smashed out one of the concourse windows, cancelling the game just after the first period.

In the 1970s, the venue&#x27;s location near Broad Street and the reputation for fisticuffs that the Flyers had developed led to the nickname &quot;Broad Street Bullies&quot;.

In 1976, the local pay television service PRISM (so-named in part as you could see &quot;the spectrum&quot; via a prism) was launched by Spectacor, carrying home games of the Flyers and 76ers (as well as the Phillies); PRISM&#x27;s technical and studio operations were based out of the event level of the Spectrum (though PRISM&#x27;s administrative offices were instead located in Bala Cynwyd). PRISM&#x27;s successor, NBC Sports Philadelphia, is based out of the present-day Wells Fargo Center in a similar arrangement.

A plaque inside The Spectrum stated that it held the world record for the fastest conversion from Hockey to Basketball.

The Spectrum, along with the Met Center and The Forum, was one of the first sports arenas to have a scoreboard with a messageboard. Furthermore, the messageboards on the Spectrum scoreboard were the first dot matrix screens in pro hockey or basketball, capable of photos, animation, and replays as well as messages. This was replaced in 1986 with ArenaVision, which consisted of six rear-projection videoscreens at the top and a four-sided American Sign and Indicator scoreboard at the bottom. Inside the videoscreens were General Electric projectors located away from each screen.

===Seating capacity===


===Flyers and 76ers&#x27; championships and All-Star Games hosted===

The Flyers won their first Stanley Cup at the Spectrum on May 19, 1974, defeating the Boston Bruins, 1–0, in Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals in front of a then-capacity crowd of 17,007. Perhaps the most important and emotional hockey game—or sporting event of any kind—ever held there, however, came at the height of the Cold War on January 11, 1976, when the Flyers became the first NHL team to defeat (by 4–1) the vaunted hockey team of the Soviet Central Red Army (ЦСКА). Two games in the inaugural Canada Cup hockey tournament were also held at the Spectrum in September of that year, as the U.S. took on Czechoslovakia and the USSR.

Ten NHL or NBA playoff championship series were hosted at the Spectrum. The Flyers competed in the Stanley Cup Finals in , , , , , and . The 76ers played in the NBA Finals in , , , and . The 1976 and 1992 NHL, and 1970 and 1976 NBA All-Star Games were also held here. The AHL Phantoms also won their first Calder Cup title on Spectrum ice before a sellout crowd of 17,380 on June 10, 1998, by defeating the Saint John Flames, 6–1.

The only visitors to win the Stanley Cup and NBA championship at the Spectrum were the Montreal Canadiens (1976) and the Los Angeles Lakers (1980) respectively.

The Spectrum is the only venue to host the NBA and NHL All-Star Games in the same season, doing so in 1976, when it also hosted that year&#x27;s Final Four. It is also one of a handful of venues to host the Stanley Cup and NBA Finals at the same time, doing so in 1980 (all four major Philadelphia teams would reach the championship round of their respective sport in 1980).

===College basketball tournaments===
The Spectrum was used for many basketball tournaments, including Big Five games, eight Atlantic 10 Conference tournaments (1977, 1983, 1997–2002), the 1975, 1980 and 1992 NCAA East Regional (site of the famous last-second shot by Christian Laettner of Duke to beat Kentucky), and the 1976 and 1981 Final Fours (both won by Bob Knight&#x27;s Indiana Hoosiers). Smaller conferences preferred holding tournament games at this venue over the larger Center nearby.

===Bull riding===
In 2003 and 2004, the PBR brought their Built Ford Tough Series tour to the Spectrum.

===Notable concerts===
Many concerts were staged at the Spectrum, often praised for its acoustic properties, beginning in the 1960s. In the 1970s, Electric Factory Concerts became the prominent concert promoter for the facility.

On the second night (June 29, 1977), Floyd member Roger Waters fell ill and did most of the show after a painkiller injection. However, the painkiller wore off and was taken to the hospital and missed the final encore of &quot;Us and Them&quot; where second guitarist Snowy White had to fill in on bass guitar. Unbeknownst to the crowd, this was the first time that the rest of Pink Floyd (guitarist/vocalist David Gilmour, drummer Nick Mason and keyboard player Rick Wright) performed a song live without Waters (they would go on without Waters as of 1986). Waters&#x27; experience performing while ill at this venue would be documented on &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;.
*The Who performed at the Spectrum throughout the 1970s. The 1973 show was documented in a famous audio bootleg of their Quadrophenia performance. A CD has been released of John Entwistle&#x27;s performance on March 15, 1975, when he opened for Humble Pie.

Their three November 1983 performances on the band&#x27;s Mama Tour were recorded for a US FM radio broadcast and was released as a bootleg entitled &quot;Three Nights in Philly&quot;. Collins would play the Spectrum on his own in September 1985, during his No Jacket Required Tour, in a concert rescheduled from May 18 of that year due to an Eastern Conference Finals game between the 76ers and the Boston Celtics.
*Queen performed at the Spectrum on August 22, 1980, during The Game Tour.
*The Jacksons performed at the Spectrum multiple times between 1971 and 1981.
*Dio performed at the Spectrum in 1984, with Twisted Sister as opener. This concert was filmed for the video release &quot;A Special from the Spectrum&quot;. Dio returned to the Spectrum in 1986; this concert was also filmed, for the video release &quot;Sacred Heart &quot;The Video&quot;&quot;.

On June 13, 1991, during the show, Axl Rose erupted after a fan had gotten into a fight with Guns N&#x27; Roses photographer Robert John when the fan kicked the camera out of his hands. Axl cursed out the fan, and challenged him to a fight. After the fan was ejected from the concert, the show continued.
*On the night of December 9, 1980, after learning of the assassination of John Lennon following a performance there the night before, Bruce Springsteen opened the show with a statement regarding Lennon and said, &quot;It&#x27;s a hard thing to come out and play but there&#x27;s just nothing else you can do.&quot; With members of the E Street Band in tears, Springsteen and his band put on a 34-song marathon which ended nearly 3½ hours later, with a cover of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;. The Spectrum was the first arena Springsteen ever played at in 1976. In the following years, Springsteen would become one of the Spectrum&#x27;s most popular concert acts, performing 42 shows between 1976 and 2009, thanks in part to the singer&#x27;s large and devoted fan base in Pennsylvania.
*Rush performed at the Spectrum as part of their &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; tour on November 5, 1984.
*Iron Maiden played a sold-out show at the Spectrum on January 13, 1987, as part of Somewhere on Tour in support of Somewhere in Time.
*Van Halen performed at the Spectrum with Gary Cherone on May 24, 1998.

*Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes&#x27; ill-fated Return to Love Tour kicked off at the Spectrum on June 14, 2000. The tour would be canceled a few weeks later.
*During the Spectrum&#x27;s final year, Taylor Swift performed at the arena as part of her Fearless Tour, while P!nk performed there as part of her Funhouse Tour. P!ink is a Philadelphia-area native, while Swift was born in Pennsylvania and spent part of her childhood there.
*The last public events at the arena took place on October 27–28 and 30–31, 2009, with Pearl Jam playing four concerts. The band came to the stage each night after a video montage of memorable Spectrum moments followed by the &quot;Rocky&quot; theme music. Over the four nights, Pearl Jam performed 103 different songs, with its final night on Halloween lasting over 3 hours and 35 minutes and including 41 songs.
*The final event was a large private cocktail party organized by Comcast Spectacor chairman Ed Snider on January 16, 2010. Musical acts included a recorded Kate Smith and a live Lauren Hart performing a duet of &quot;God Bless America&quot;, headliner Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, with the last set being a performance by Elvis Presley interpreter Johnny Seaton.

Philadelphia soul groups that performed at the Spectrum include LaBelle in &#x27;71 and Hall &amp; Oates in &#x27;83. The O&#x27;Jays (they were signed to Philadelphia International) performed there in &#x27;73, and Lou Rawls (also signed to Philly International) performed there in &#x27;69. Boyz II Men from Philly performed there in &#x27;95.

Guns N&#x27; Roses performed at the Philadelphia Spectrum on August 4, 1988; August 5, 1988; June 13, 1991; December 16, 1991; and December 17, 1991.

===Spectrum Theater===
The Spectrum Theater was a venue for acts not big enough to fill the entire Spectrum arena. The stage was placed in the middle of the Spectrum floor, and the other half of the arena behind the stage was closed off with curtains, creating a theater-like environment. Some of the acts that played in this configuration included Frank Zappa in 1973, 1976 and 1977; David Bowie&#x27;s Diamond Dogs Tour in 1974; The Kinks&#x27; Soap Opera Tour in May 1975, Bob Marley&#x27;s Natty Dread Tour in 1975 and Kaya Tour in 1978; Bruce Springsteen in 1976; The Bee Gees in 1979; Peter Gabriel&#x27;s tour in 1982; Howard Jones in 1985 and Julian Lennon with Chris Bliss on June 20, 1986.

===The Flyers and 76ers&#x27; move===
The 1995–96 NHL and NBA seasons were the final ones for the Flyers and the 76ers at the Spectrum. The 76ers&#x27; last game was a 112–92 loss to the Orlando Magic on April 19; on May 12, Eric Lindros scored the arena&#x27;s final Flyers goal in the 2nd period, and Mike Hough of the Florida Panthers scored the arena&#x27;s final official NHL goal in the 2nd overtime of Game 5 of the 1996 Eastern Conference semifinals, a 2–1 Flyers loss. Although both the Flyers and 76ers moved across the parking lot to the new and larger Wells Fargo Center (then CoreStates Center), the arena remained in place and was used by the Philadelphia Phantoms of the AHL, the Philadelphia KiXX of the NISL, the Philadelphia Soul of the Arena Football League for Saturday home games, and a variety of other sporting events and concerts.

The Spectrum had relatively few luxury suites or other amenities common in newer arenas. Additionally, the arena&#x27;s sight lines were cited as a concern. Some seats in both the hockey and basketball configurations (especially those added in the upper level over the years) had badly obstructed views. There was only one concourse for all three levels, making for somewhat cramped conditions whenever attendance was anywhere near capacity.

===Final season===

On July 14, 2008, Comcast Spectacor Chairman Ed Snider officially announced that the Spectrum would be shuttered and torn down to make way for &quot;Philly Live!&quot;, a proposed retail, dining and entertainment hub. &quot;This has been one of the hardest decisions I&#x27;ve ever had to make,&quot; said Snider. &quot;The Spectrum is my baby. It&#x27;s one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me.&quot;

The Phantoms commemorated the final season of the Spectrum by wearing a special patch on their uniforms, as illustrated on the right. The team also celebrated some of the building&#x27;s memorable moments throughout the season. The Flyers marked the last season by playing two pre-season games at the Spectrum. They played the Carolina Hurricanes in an NHL pre-season game on September 27, 2008, and the Phantoms on October 7 of that same year. Before the game against Carolina, the Flyers honored the team captains in the franchise&#x27;s history. Those honored in the pre-game ceremony were Lou Angotti, Ed Van Impe, Bob Clarke, Mel Bridgman, Bill Barber, Dave Poulin, Ron Sutter, Kevin Dineen, Éric Desjardins, Keith Primeau and Derian Hatcher.

The last NCAA basketball game the Spectrum hosted saw the Villanova Wildcats defeat the Pittsburgh Panthers on January 28, 2009. The Sixers played one regular season game against Chicago Bulls on March 13, 2009, winning by a score of 104–101 in the final NBA game in the Spectrum. The game was sold-out and attendance was 17,563.

The Phantoms&#x27; last regular season game at the Spectrum was played April 10, 2009, against the Hershey Bears, as the Phantoms won the game, 5–2, while the last Kixx game was against the Massachusetts Twisters on March 22. The Kixx moved onto the Temple University campus and played the 2009–10 season at the Liacouras Center. The Phantoms were sold to a Pittsburgh-based ownership group, and moved to Glens Falls, New York, for the 2009–10 season, and subsequently moved to Allentown, where they became the Flyers-affiliated Lehigh Valley Phantoms.

&quot;With this season being the final season of the Wachovia Spectrum, we will celebrate the history of the Spectrum with an exciting, year-long, celebration of events,&quot; Comcast Spectacor President Peter Luukko said. Phish was rumored to be among the acts to commemorate the closing of the arena. &quot;It is our hope and intent to bring back many of the musical acts and entertainers who have made the Spectrum &#x27;America&#x27;s Showplace. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band played two shows at The Spectrum on April 28 and 29 as part of their Working on a Dream Tour, and returned on October 13–14 and 19–20 for their Spectrum swan song. Springsteen debuted a specially-written version of the song &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot;, which he had written in honor of the demolition of Giants Stadium, with revised lyrics to honor the Spectrum.

A scheduled concert with Leonard Cohen on October 22 was moved to the Tower Theatre in Upper Darby, instead. On October 23, 2009, Philadelphia area musicians The Hooters, Todd Rundgren and Hall &amp; Oates headlined a concert titled &quot;Last Call&quot;. Tickets were as low as $6.00. The remaining members of the Grateful Dead; including Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann performed their final set of shows at the Spectrum on May 1 and 2, 2009; the show of May 2 was their 54th consecutive sell-out at the Spectrum. The Dead closed the show of May 2 with the song &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;. The song contains the fitting refrain &quot;If I had my way, I would tear this old building down.&quot; The lyric was changed by the band&#x27;s singer Bob Weir to say &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t tear this old building down.&quot; With the demolition of The Spectrum, all venues at which The Grateful Dead played through their career within the City of Philadelphia, except for the Irvine Auditorium, have succumbed to the wrecking ball.

On October 27, 28, 30, and 31, American rock band Pearl Jam played over one hundred unique songs across the four days. On the final night, the band played 34 songs over nearly four hours before ending with their hit &quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot;.

==The Spectrum and the South Philadelphia Sports Complex==

Opened in 1967 as the first of the five modern facilities to be built at the South Philadelphia Sports Complex between 1967 and 2004, by the time it closed in 2009 the Spectrum was the oldest of the four venues still standing of the two indoor arenas and four outdoor stadiums built at the South end of Broad Street since 1926. The complex&#x27;s total area expanded with the addition of each new facility and now takes up the entire southeast quadrant of the grounds occupied in 1926 by Philadelphia&#x27;s Sesqui-Centennial International Exposition, a massive 184-day World&#x27;s fair built on 700+ acres of until then largely undeveloped city-owned swamp and park land, including League Island Park adjacent to the U.S. Navy Yard bounded by 10th Street, Packer Ave., 23rd Street, and Terminal Avenue. The Spectrum itself occupied the portion of the Exposition&#x27;s grounds on the south side of Pattison Avenue between Broad and 11th Streets that in 1926 served as the fair&#x27;s main trolley terminal operated by the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company.
For its first 25 years, the Spectrum overlooked the 102,000-seat John F. Kennedy Stadium, known prior to 1964 as &quot;Municipal Stadium&quot;, located roughly south of the indoor arena. Opened on April 15, 1926, the stadium was also the Sesqui-Centennial Exposition&#x27;s only intentionally permanent facility. The site of 42 Army–Navy Games between 1936 and 1979, JFK Stadium eventually fell into disuse in favor of the newer nearby Veterans Stadium, was condemned in 1989, and demolished in 1992 to make way for the Wells Fargo Center which opened four years later in August 1996. Known earlier as the &quot;CoreStates Center&quot; (1996–1998), the &quot;First Union Center&quot; (1998–2003), and the &quot;Wachovia Center&quot; (July 2003 – June 2010), the 20,000-plus-seat indoor arena replaced the Spectrum as the home of the Flyers, 76ers, and Philadelphia Wings of the National Lacrosse League beginning with each club&#x27;s 1996–97 season. With the demolition of the Spectrum, the Wells Fargo Center has now become the oldest of the complex&#x27;s three current venues.

The Spectrum&#x27;s closest sports complex neighbor was Veterans Stadium (opened 1971, closed 2003, demolished 2004), which was located north of the arena directly across Pattison Avenue. The 60,000-plus-seat &quot;Vet&quot; accommodated MLB&#x27;s Philadelphia Phillies and the NFL&#x27;s Philadelphia Eagles for just over three decades before it was itself replaced by two new facilities. In 2003 the Eagles moved to Lincoln Financial Field, a purpose-built football/soccer stadium located SE of the Spectrum site directly across 11th Street from the Wells Fargo Center. The following year, the Phillies relocated to Citizens Bank Park, a dedicated baseball stadium completed in 2004 and located diagonally across from the Spectrum site at the northeast corner of Pattison Ave and Citizens Bank Way (11th St.), immediately east of the former Veterans Stadium site which now serves as a parking lot for the entire complex. In 2017, the Phillies&#x27; spring training complex in Clearwater, Florida was renamed Spectrum Field after Bright House Networks was purchased by Charter Communications. While named for Charter&#x27;s residential service, the name invoked memories of the Spectrum arena.

Another NBA arena (Spectrum Center, the home of the Charlotte Hornets) currently includes &quot;Spectrum&quot; in its name, although again it refers to the Charter residential service whose naming rights are attached to that building.

==Demolition==
Although the Spectrum formally closed on October 31, 2009, demolition of the structure did not begin for more than a year with internal work commencing on November 8, 2010. Two weeks later a public &quot;wrecking ball ceremony&quot; attended by some of the athletes who made the building famous such as Hockey Hall of Famers Bernie Parent and Bob Clarke of the Flyers and Hall of Famer Julius Erving of the 76ers, was held in the adjacent parking lot &quot;H&quot; on November 23, 2010, to formally begin its external demolition. However, unlike Veterans Stadium, its one-time neighbor, which had been located immediately across Pattison Avenue from the Spectrum before it was imploded on March 21, 2004, the almost half-year process of demolishing the then-44-year-old arena, done without the use of explosives, was completed in May 2011. This was done to protect its other sports facilities from dust. Water was used to prevent dust from spreading.

A 300-room hotel is planned to eventually be built on the demolished Spectrum&#x27;s site, which is now occupied by a parking lot, as an adjunct to the Xfinity Live! project, the first portion of which opened in April 2012, at the southwest corner of 11th Street and Pattison Avenue.

==Statues==

A statue of Sylvester Stallone, depicted in his role of Philadelphia boxer Rocky Balboa, stood for many years in front of the main Pattison Avenue entrance of the Spectrum, which had been represented in the movie as the site of Rocky&#x27;s first and second fights with Apollo Creed. (The fight sequences were actually filmed at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena.) The statue was removed several times over the years to be used in the filming of sequels to the original film.

In September 2006, it was given a new home in an area near the base of the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art not far from where a spot on the plaza at the top of the Museum&#x27;s steps where it had appeared in the film &quot;Rocky III&quot;. Since the statue was not deemed &quot;art,&quot; it was moved around the corner of the museum on Kelly Drive. Other statues that stood in the arena area included:

*&quot;Score!&quot;, a statue depicting Flyers&#x27; right-wing Gary Dornhoefer&#x27;s game-winning overtime goal in Game 5 of the 1973 Stanley Cup Quarterfinals against the Minnesota North Stars;
*A statue of Kate Smith, the Flyers&#x27; good luck charm, whose rendition of &quot;God Bless America&quot; is believed to have helped the Flyers become back-to-back Stanley Cup Champions in 1974 and 1975;
*A statue of Julius Erving, who played for the Philadelphia 76ers from 1976 to 1987.

The statues have been incorporated into the design of &quot;Xfinity Live!&quot;.

<text>Tissot SA () is a Swiss luxury watch brand owned by the Swatch Group. The company was founded in Le Locle, Switzerland by Charles-Félicien Tissot and his son, Charles-Émile Tissot, in 1853.

Tissot is not associated with Mathey-Tissot, another Swiss watchmaking firm.

==History==

=== Independent company ===
Tissot was founded in 1853 by Charles-Félicien Tissot and his son Charles-Émile Tissot in the Swiss city of Le Locle, in the Neuchâtel canton of the Jura Mountains area. The father and son team worked as a casemaker (Charles-Félicien Tissot) and watchmaker (Charles-Emile). His son having expressed an interest in watchmaking from a young age. The two turned their house at the time into a small &#x27;factory&#x27;. Charles-Emile Tissot left for Russia in 1858 and succeeded in selling their savonnette pocket watches across the Russian Empire. Russia became Tissot&#x27;s greatest market, with the brand gaining popularity even in the Tsar&#x27;s court; so Charles Tissot, Charles-Émile&#x27;s son, moved to Moscow in 1885 to manage the branch his father had set up there.

===Omega, SSIH, ASUAG, SMH===
In 1929, the global financial collapse brought the entire watch industry to a standstill, and Omega and Tissot forged an alliance under the leadership of Paul Tissot-Daguette, who had been trained at Tissot and became Omega&#x27;s chief executive officer in 1930. The merger formed Société Suisse pour l&#x27;Industrie Horlogère (SSIH), and Tissot-Omega watches from this era are sought after by collectors.

Tissot&#x27;s first engagement as an official timekeeper was in 1938 where they timed a series of ski races in Villars-sur-Ollon, near the company&#x27;s home town in the Jura mountains. Tissot was used for timing downhill skiing in Switzerland in 1938, and for the Davis Cup in 1957.

SSIH-ASUAG was formed in 1983 (Allgemeine Schweizerische Uhrenindustrie Aktiengesellschaft, ASUAG, was a holding company supplying the watch industry), then SMH (Société Suisse de Microélectronique et
d’horlogerie; 1983–1985).

=== Swatch subsidiary ===
SMH took the name of &quot;the Swatch Group&quot; in 1998. Tissot SA remained in Le Locle, Switzerland, and marketed in 160 countries. Tissot watches are classified by the Swatch Group as &quot;mid-range market&quot; products.

Tissot is an official timekeeper for the world championships in cycling, motorcycling, fencing and ice hockey, etc. Tissot was a sponsor for the Formula One car-racing teams Lotus, Renault, and Sauber. In the past handheld stopwatches were sufficient to provide official timings; in more recent times manufacturers and sporting bodies together develop more accurate systems for specific events. In competitive cycling, for instance, sensors are placed on the bikes and track, and linked by computers to provide track timings and performance data.

== Motto and slogan ==

The company motto/slogan of Tissot is &quot;Innovators by Tradition&quot; and its mission statement is &quot;gold value at silver price&quot;.

== Innovations ==
Tissot introduced the first mass-produced pocket watch as well as the first pocket watch with two time zones in 1853 and the first anti-magnetic watch, in 1929–30. Tissot was also one of the first companies to manufacture an antimagnetic wristwatch in the early 1930s. The Tissot company was also the first to make watches out of plastic (Idea 2001 in 1971), stone (the Alpine granite RockWatch in 1985), mother of pearl (the Pearl watch in 1987), and wood (the Wood watch in 1988).

Tissot introduced its first tactile watch, with &quot;T-Touch,&quot; technology in 1999; watches containing this technology have touch-sensitive sapphire crystals to control various functions including compass, barometer, altimeter and thermometer. The 2014 T-Touch Expert Solar and T-Touch Lady Solar had 25 functions.

==Marketing==
Tissot has partnered with a wide range of celebrities from basketball players, actors, cricket players, to MotoGP racers to be their brand ambassadors. Tissot brand ambassadors have included: Tony Parker, Liu Yi Fei, Virat Kohli, Deepika Padukone, Huang Xiaoming, Jorge Lorenzo, Thomas Lüthi, Neha Kakkar, Marc Márquez and Rana Daggubati, Simon Gong Jun. Tissot is also currently the official watch for the NBA.

== Clientele ==
Tissot watches have been worn by Catherine, Princess of Wales, Sarah Bernhardt, singer Carmen Miranda, Grace Kelly, and Nelson Mandela.

==In popular culture==

James Stewart wore a Tissot watch in &quot;Rear Window&quot;. T-Touch watches have been worn by Angelina Jolie in the movies &quot;Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life&quot; and &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot;. Simon Pegg wore a T-Touch in &quot;&quot;.. Richard Roundtree appears to wear a Tissot PR 516 with steel rally bracelet in &quot;Shaft&quot;. Indian actor Kamal Haasan wore a Tissot watch in 2008 Tamil film &quot;Dasavathaaram&quot;.

== Sponsorships ==
Tissot has been the official timekeeper responsible for timing in several sports including MotoGP, the International Ice Hockey Federation, the Union Cycliste Internationale, the International Basketball Federation (FIBA), the International Fencing Federation, the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association, for many years. In basketball it has sponsored the Swiss national team, the Chinese Basketball Association, the NBA and other related events, teams, and organizations.

<doc id="754121" wikidata="Q436482" url="?curid=754121" title="Horacio Vásquez">
<text>Felipe Horacio Vásquez Lajara (October 22, 1860 – March 25, 1936) was a Dominican Republic military general and political figure. He served as the president of the Provisional Government Junta of the Dominican Republic in 1899, and again between 1902 and 1903. Supporters of Vásquez were known as Horacistas, as opposed to Jimenistas, supporters of Vásquez&#x27;s main rival, Juan Isidro Jimenes. He ran for a full term as president in 1914, but lost to Jimenes.

In 1888, Vásquez married Trina de Moya, a poet and writer from La Vega.

Following the occupation of the Dominican Republic by U.S. military forces from 1916–1924, Vásquez was democratically elected as president of the country and served between 1924 and 1930, and again separately in 1930 before being ousted by General Rafael Trujillo and sent into exile in Puerto Rico.

A metro station in Santo Domingo is named after him.

==Early life==
Horacio Vásquez was born on October 22, 1860, in the city of Moca in the Cibao region. His parents were Basilio Vásquez Lizardo (son of the Spanish Ramón Vásquez and the Mocana María Lizardo Caba) and Ramona Lajara Gómez (daughter of the Azuano Pedro Lajara and Tomasa Gómez).

Vásquez acquired important knowledge, as a young adult he dedicated himself to agricultural and commercial work, frequently traveling to La Vega, where he was related to his socially important family. A man of great stature and a strong physical presence, he quickly gained the popularity from people who especially appreciated him for his serenity, the rectitude of his conduct, his intellectual conditions and his distinguished bearing.

Horacio Vásquez was 26 years old when he entered politics a few days after the Moya Revolution broke out. When the city of La Vega was attacked by insurgent troops, he stood out in its defense, showing solidarity and fighting for the government headed by Alejandro Woss and Gil.

==Political career==

In the military coup of 1902, Vásquez expelled President Jiménez, dissolved the congress and assumed power under the legal form of &quot;Provisional President&quot; with the support of the National Party and without naming a vice president. In 1903, faced with a chaotic situation in the economy and the threat of intervention by the United States, a coup d&#x27;état overthrew General Vásquez, who after several weeks of fighting, resigned as president of the provisional government in April 1903.

After the American occupation of 1916 until 1924 he returned to occupy the presidency of the Republic, after elections were held and with the approval of the American troops who withdrew from the island. He was elected president for the period 1924-1928 with 69.8% of the votes, but the forced extension of his mandate until 1930 and his eventual reelection caused a revolt by the National Guard, led by Rafael Trujillo, that overthrew Vásquez in 1930.

Vásquez&#x27;s supporters were known as Horacistas, unlike the Jimenistas, supporters of Vásquez&#x27;s main rival.

<doc id="754125" wikidata="Q6791358" url="?curid=754125" title="Matthew Vassar">
<text>Matthew Vassar (April 29, 1792 – June 23, 1868) was an English-American brewer, merchant, and philanthropist. He founded Vassar College, a women’s college, in 1861. He was a cousin of John Ellison Vassar. The city of Vassar, Michigan, is named after him.

==Early life==
Matthew Vassar was born on April 29, 1792, in East Dereham, Norfolk, England, to James and Ann Bennett Vassar, farmers of French Huguenot ancestry (Vasseur) who emigrated from England. In 1796, they arrived in New York State and settled on a farm along Wappinger&#x27;s Creek on land that had been part of the 1685 Rondout Patent near Manchester Bridge in Dutchess County. While the farmhouse was being built, the family lived on the Filkintown Road, at what is now the intersection of Main and Church Streets. In 1801, James Vassar brewed ale with barley grown from seeds his brother Thomas brought from Norfolk. Demand for the ale was such that, in 1801, James Vassar sold the farm and bought a lot between Main and Mill Streets in the village of Poughkeepsie from Baltus Van Kleeck to build a brewery. When Vassar was 14 years old, his parents had him apprenticed to a tanner.

==Business career==
In 1806, one day before he was to begin his apprenticeship, he ran away and crossing the Hudson River on the ferry at High Point made his way to Balm Town, just north of Newburgh, New York. There he found a job working in a store. He subsequently took a better-paying job with another local merchant before returning to Poughkeepsie in 1810, where he joined the family brewing business as bookkeeper and collector. By this time the family had most of the brewing trade in the river towns from Newburgh to Hudson. In 1811, a malt-dust explosion destroyed the family brewery on Vassar Street. His elder brother John died in the explosion, and his father was devastated by the loss. Matthew, then only 18, took over management of the business which was then conducted out of part of an old dye house belonging to George Booth, husband of Vassar&#x27;s sister Maria. Booth, an immigrant from Yorkshire, England, was the first manufacturer of woolen cloth in Dutchess County.

During the War of 1812, Vassar joined the local fusilier&#x27;s company as a sergeant, but saw little action. He spent his days at the brewery and his evenings working at an oyster saloon and restaurant he had opened in the basement of the county courthouse. In 1813, he married Catherine Valentine of Fishkill. In 1814, Vassar opened M. Vassar &amp; Company and rebuilt the brewery on Vassar Street across the street from the family townhouse. At the time, it was the largest brewery of its kind in the United States. He served as a Poughkeepsie village trustee in 1819. He spent the winter of 1822 in New Orleans. In September 1824, he was among those welcoming the Marquis de Lafayette to Poughkeepsie on the occasion of the General&#x27;s visit to the United States.

In 1831, Vassar took an active part in the incorporation of the Poughkeepsie Saving Bank and the following year became a shareholder in the Poughkeepsie Whaling Company, for which he built a large dock. In 1836, he built a larger brick brewery on the waterfront just above the Main Street Landing. The waterfront facility had a brewing capacity of 60,000 barrels annually. Both the malt and the hops were produced locally. M. Vassar &amp; Co. owned a fleet of sloops to transport its ale to market. The company expanded to include two facilities in Poughkeepsie, one in New York City, and one in Lansingburgh, near Troy, New York. He brought John Guy Vassar and Matthew Vassar Jr., sons of his deceased brother John, into the business, who later founded Vassar Brothers Hospital in Poughkeepsie. In 1837, he took over the bankrupt brickyard of his brother Charles, which made bricks at what later came to be known as Brickyard Hill on the east side of town. He joined the board of the Farmers and Manufacturers National Bank and, in 1835, was elected president of the village of Poughkeepsie on the &quot;Improvement&quot; ticket.

In the 1850s, Vassar was president of the Poughkeepsie Lyceum of Literature, Science and the Mechanical Arts. He opened the 1852 season with the presentation of an address by Ralph Waldo Emerson. In 1851, John A. Bolding, a fugitive slave from South Carolina was working as a tailor on Main Street, when he was seized by a U.S. Marshall under the terms of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. When members of the Underground Railroad fell short of the amount necessary to buy Bolding&#x27;s freedom, Matthew Vassar was among those who made up the difference.

Matthew Vassar died in his seventy-seventh year on June 23, 1868, while delivering his farewell address to the Vassar College Board of Trustees. His funeral was held in the Baptist Church on Lafayette Place. Vassar had donated the land and half the cost of erecting the church. He was buried in the Poughkeepsie Rural Cemetery.

==Legacy==

===Springside===

Springside was the estate of Matthew Vassar, located just off US 9 on Academy Street in Poughkeepsie. It lay across the road from &quot;Woodside&quot;, the estate of retired manufacturer G.C. Burnap. Andrew Jackson Downing designed the grounds, and with Calvert Vaux, the main house, which was never built. Springside was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1969 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
===Vassar, Michigan===
Vassar, Michigan, was founded on the Cass River in 1849 by James M. Edmunds. Its main industry was lumbering. Edmunds was a nephew of Matthew Vassar. Edmunds named the settlement after his uncle, who put up the seed money for the project.

===Vassar College===

Vassar&#x27;s niece, Lydia Booth, a teacher who ran the &quot;Cottage Hill Seminary&quot; out of a building Vassar owned on Garden Street, encouraged him to establish a women&#x27;s college in Poughkeepsie. In January 1861, the New York Legislature passed an act to incorporate Vassar College, one of the first women&#x27;s colleges in the U.S. On 26 February 1861, at the Hotel Gregory in Poughkeepsie, Matthew Vassar presented the college&#x27;s Board of Trustees with a tin box containing half of his fortune, $408,000 (approximately $9,700,000 in 2008 dollars) and a deed of conveyance for of land to establish the campus. In 1864, Vassar purchased the art collection of Elias Lyman Magoon, a noted collector of Hudson River School paintings. Vassar&#x27;s diary entry for June 16, 1865 states, &quot;Sick and tired of College business, no one to help me Except &quot;Scow&quot;, Doct Raymond and Swan.&quot; In a bill enacted on 15 July 1870, the U.S. Congress waived any tax claim(s) to the donation to the college.

===USS &quot;Matthew Vassar&quot;===
The USS &quot;Matthew Vassar&quot; was a wooden centerboard schooner. It was purchased by the U.S. Navy in New York in September 1861 and commissioned in January 1862. The ship was assigned to a Mortar Flotilla guarding the approaches to New Orleans. In November 1864, it was assigned to the East Coast Blockading Squadron. After the war the ship was decommissioned and sold at auction.

In 1880, Matthew Vassar&#x27;s nephews, John Guy Vassar and Matthew Vassar Jr., converted the site of their uncle&#x27;s mansion at 9 Vassar Street into the Vassar Home for Aged Men. It remained a senior citizen&#x27;s home through much of the 20th century. The Vassar Home was added to the NRHP in 1972.

===Vassar Institute===

In 1882, Vassar&#x27;s nephews converted the site of the old brewery at 12 Vassar Street into the Vassar Institute. The first floor contained a natural history museum and the second a library, as well as offices for the Poughkeepsie Literary Society and Poughkeepsie Society of Natural Sciences. Vassar Institute was added to the NRHP in 1972.

===Vassar Hospital===

Vassar Brothers Hospital was endowed by John Guy Vassar and Matthew Vassar Jr., sons of Mathew Vassar&#x27;s deceased elder brother, whom he helped to prosperity by bringing them into his thriving brewing business.

<text>Bigelow Aerospace was an American space design and manufacturing company which ceased operations in 2020. It was an aeronautics and outer space technology company which manufactured and developed expandable space station modules. Bigelow Aerospace was founded by Robert Bigelow in 1998, and was based in North Las Vegas, Nevada. It was funded in large part by the profit Bigelow gained through his ownership of the hotel chain, Budget Suites of America.

The company built two unmanned free-flying prototypes that flew in 2006 and 2007 and a module attached to the International Space Station. Bigelow Aerospace announced in 2010 that they intended to create a modular set of space habitats for creating or expanding space stations. By 2013, Bigelow had invested US$250 million in the company. Bigelow stated on a number of occasions that he was prepared to fund Bigelow Aerospace with about US$500 million through 2015 in order to achieve launch of full-scale hardware.

In March 2020, the company laid off all 88 of its employees due to the COVID-19 pandemic. the company remains dormant and is currently considered defunct.

== History ==
Bigelow originally licensed the multi-layer, expandable space module technology from NASA in 2000 after Congress canceled the International Space Station (ISS) TransHab project following delays and budget constraints in the late 1990s.

Bigelow has three Space Act agreements whereby Bigelow Aerospace is the sole commercializer of several of NASA&#x27;s key expandable module technologies.

Bigelow continued to develop the technology for a decade, redesigning the module fabric layers – including adding proprietary extensions of Vectran shield fabric, &quot;a double-strength variant of Kevlar&quot; – and developing a family of uncrewed and crewed expandable spacecraft in a variety of sizes. Bigelow invested US$75 million in proprietary extensions to the NASA technology by mid-2006, and US$180 million into the technology by 2010.

By 2010, Robert Bigelow had invested US$180 million in the company, which by 2013 had grown to US$250 million of his personal fortune. Bigelow stated on multiple occasions that he was prepared to fund Bigelow Aerospace with up to about US$500 million through 2015 in order to achieve launch of full-scale hardware.

In early 2010, NASA came full circle to once again investigate &quot;making inflatable space-station modules to make roomier, lighter, cheaper-to-launch spacecraft&quot; by announcing plans in its budget proposal released 22 February 2010. NASA considered connecting a Bigelow expandable craft to the ISS for safety, life support, radiation shielding, thermal control and communications verification testing for the next three years&quot;, and in December 2012, signed a US$17.8 million contract with Bigelow to develop the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM), then projected to fly in 2015. The module was berthed to the International Space Station on 16 April 2016, and was inflated on 28 May 2016. it remains at the station.

Since early on, Bigelow had been intent on &quot;pursuing markets for a variety of users including biotech and pharmaceutical companies and university research, entertainment applications and government military and civil users&quot;. The business model includes &quot;&#x27;leasing out&#x27; small space stations or habitats made of one or more [B330] inflatable modules to different research communities or corporations&quot;. Despite these broad plans for space commercialization, the &quot;space tourism destination&quot; and &quot;space hotel&quot; monikers were frequently used by many media outlets following the 2006/2007 launches of Genesis I and Genesis II. Robert Bigelow has been explicit that he is aiming to do business in space in a new way, with &quot;low cost and rapid turnaround, contrary to traditional NASA ISS and Space Shuttle operations and bureaucracy&quot;.

In October 2010, Bigelow announced that it had agreements with six sovereign nations to utilize on-orbit facilities of the commercial space station: UK Astronomy Technology Centre (United Kingdom), Netherlands Space Office (Netherlands), Defence South Australia (Australia), Singapore Government Technology Development Agency (Singapore), Japan Manned Space Systems Corporation, chairman is a previous director of JAXA (Japan) and Swedish National Space Board (Sweden). In February 2011, Dubai of the United Arab Emirates became the seventh nation to have signed on.

In 2011, Bigelow employed an in-house team of model makers, coming from the film and architecture industries, to make detailed models of their space habitats and space stations. Scale models were sent to &quot;potential customers, including governments and corporations, as a reminder of the possibilities&quot;.

Reportedly due to delays in launch capability to transport humans to low Earth orbit, Bigelow dramatically reduced staff in late September 2011, because crew transportation would not become available until &quot;years after the first B330 could be ready&quot;, laying off 40 of their 90 employees.

In late March 2012 Bigelow began increasing staff levels once again. By April 2013, Bigelow said that they would have B330 modules ready to go to space by the time that commercial passenger spacecraft were available to ferry their customers to the dual–BA330 Alpha space station – expected in 2017 – and that Bigelow was ready to enter into contracts with customers.

Further staff reductions occurred at the start of 2016, estimated by industry sources to be between 30 and 50 people of 150 employed at the time of the layoffs. This came after the company advertised more than 100 jobs in 2015 at both its North Las Vegas headquarters and its newly established propulsion department in Huntsville, Alabama. As part of its reduction in workforce, the company closed the Huntsville facility.

In February 2018, the company announced the formation of a new subsidiary, Bigelow Space Operations, to handle operational aspects of marketing and operating space stations in low Earth orbit.

In March 2020, the company laid off all of its employees, 88 in total.

In December 2021, Bigelow transferred ownership of BEAM to NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center.

===NASA Lawsuit===

Bigelow Aerospace is known for its innovative work on inflatable space habitats. Bigelow Aerospace entered into a contract with NASA. The contract was to supply an expandable habitat module for the International Space Station (ISS). This module is known as the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM). The BEAM was successfully launched and attached to the ISS in 2016. In March 2021, Bigelow Aerospace filed a lawsuit against NASA. Bigelow Aerospace claimed that NASA owed the company $1.05 million. The lawsuit alleged that NASA had not paid the full amount stipulated in the contract. The contract was related to work Bigelow Aerospace had completed. The dispute centered around NASA&#x27;s refusal to pay Bigelow Aerospace for its contributions to the BEAM project. Bigelow Aerospace contended that it had met all the required milestones and deliverables under the contract. However, NASA had not fulfilled its payment obligations. The company argued that NASA&#x27;s failure to pay the agreed-upon amount had caused significant financial strain. This was especially the case as the company was already facing challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a broader downturn in the space industry. NASA contested Bigelow Aerospace&#x27;s claims. The agency said it had already paid the company for the completed work under the contract. Bigelow Aerospace had not met the criteria for additional payments, according to NASA. NASA argued that they had fulfilled the contract terms on their side. The remaining funds were not owed to the company, NASA stated.

== Module design and business plans ==
=== Expandable module design overview ===
Bigelow Aerospace anticipates that its inflatable modules will be more durable than rigid modules. This is partially due to the company&#x27;s use of several layers of Vectran, a material twice as strong as Kevlar, and also because, in theory, flexible walls should be able to sustain micrometeoroid impacts better than rigid walls. In ground-based testing, micrometeoroids capable of puncturing standard ISS module materials penetrated only about halfway through the Bigelow skin. Operations director Mike Gold commented that Bigelow modules also wouldn&#x27;t suffer from the same local shattering problems likely with metallic modules. This could provide as much as 24 hours to remedy punctures in comparison to the more serious results of standard ISS skin micrometeoroid damage.

Expected uses for Bigelow Aerospace&#x27;s expandable modules include microgravity research and development and space manufacturing. Other potential uses include variable – gravity research – for gravity gradients above microgravity including Moon (0.16 g) and Mars (0.38 g) gravity research; space tourism – such as modules for orbital hotels; and space transportation – such as components in spaceships for Moon or Mars crewed missions.

=== Business plans ===
 the Bigelow Aerospace website shows several pricing schemes including US$51.25 million for 60 days on a B330 space station. That price covers everything including transport, training, and consumables. For US$25 million Bigelow Aerospace customers can lease a third of a B330 habitat, roughly 110 cubic meters, for a period of 60 days.

In 2010, Bigelow proposed conceptual designs for expandable habitats that would be substantially larger than the B330, previously its largest at habitat volume. Contingent on NASA going forward with a super heavy lifter, the proposed concept would include &quot;expandable habitats offering 2,100 cubic meters [74,000 cubic feet] of volume – nearly twice the capacity available on the International Space Station&quot;, and another providing .

In 2010, Bigelow Aerospace began building a large production facility in North Las Vegas, Nevada to produce the space modules. The facility will include three production lines for three distinct spacecraft, doubling the amount of floor space at Bigelow, and transitioning the focus from research and development, with an existing workforce of 115, to production. Bigelow expected to hire approximately 1,200 new employees to staff the plant, with production commencing in early 2012.

In 2013, during execution of the contract to build the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module for the International Space Station, Robert Bigelow indicated that his company manufactures about 50% of product content in-house, while subcontracting out the remainder.

In March 2013, Bigelow signed an agreement with NASA to act as &quot;the central link between NASA and dozens of private companies that want to play a role in the creation of a new economy – a space economy, including proposals far more complex than mere space tourism: research, manufacturing, medicine and agriculture. The agreement calls for Bigelow to liaise between NASA and the private sector to see how the U.S. government and industry could help each other&quot;.

The first deliverable on that contract, a &quot;report which identifies companies that want to be a part of this effort, as well as potential customers&quot;, was delivered by Bigelow to NASA in May 2013.

== Modules ==
On 12 July 2006, and 28 June 2007, Bigelow launched the Genesis I and II modules, respectively. In mid-2008, Bigelow Aerospace completed the Galaxy module but did not launch it due to rising launch costs and the ability to substantially validate the new Galaxy technologies terrestrially, particularly after the successful two Genesis launches in 2006 and 2007. It was tested on the ground at its North Las Vegas facility instead.

As of 2014, Bigelow had reserved a 2015 launch on SpaceX&#x27;s Falcon 9 rocket, but did not announce the payload. The Falcon 9 would have been capable of launching a Sundancer module, but not a B330 module. Bigelow also talked with Lockheed Martin regarding potential launches on the Atlas V-401 launch vehicle. No launch took place in 2015, although in April 2016 Bigelow Aerospace remained on SpaceX&#x27;s list of future launch customers. On 8 April 2016, the SpaceX CRS-8 mission launched BEAM to the ISS; on 11 April 2016, Bigelow and United Launch Alliance announced that an Atlas V-552 rocket had been booked for a flight in 2020 to deliver a B330 habitat to low-Earth orbit.

Note: Current as of July 2021. Dates of upcoming launches are proposed and are subject to change.

=== Expandable habitat modules ===
==== Genesis I ====
On 12 July 2006, Genesis I launched on a Dnepr booster from Dombarovsky Cosmodrome in Orenburg Oblast, Russia. The launch was conducted by Bigelow and ISC Kosmotras. Despite ground-side difficulties during launch, the spacecraft performed as expected upon reaching orbit, inflating, deploying solar arrays and starting internal systems. The mission is planned to last for five years and include extensive observation of the craft&#x27;s performance including testing packing/deployment procedures and resistance to radiation and space debris, among other space hazards and conditions. Mike Gold, corporate counsel for Bigelow Aerospace, stated in relation to this mission and the next, &quot;Our motto at Bigelow Aerospace is &#x27;fly early and often&#x27;. Regardless of the results of &quot;Genesis 1&quot;, we will launch a follow-up mission rapidly&quot;. , the vehicle remains in orbit.

==== Genesis II ====
On 28 June 2007, Genesis II launched on another Dnepr (a converted SS-18 ICBM) from Dombarovsky Cosmodrome in Orenburg Oblast, Russia. Launched at 08:02 PDT, Genesis II was inserted into orbit at 08:16 PDT at an inclination of 64.0°.

Although Genesis I and Genesis II are identical in size and similar in appearance there are several notable differences. Firstly, Genesis I contains 13 video cameras whereas Genesis II contains 22. Secondly, Genesis II includes a suite of additional sensors and avionics that are not present in Genesis I.

The orbital life is estimated to be 12 years, with a gradually decaying orbit resulting in re-entry into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and burn-up expected. , the vehicle remains in orbit.

;&quot;Fly your stuff&quot; program
Bigelow Aerospace ran a Fly Your Stuff program for the Genesis II launch. The cost to launch pictures or small items was around US$300. Bigelow photographed each item with internal cameras as the items floated inside the craft, displaying them on the company website.

The first image of the interior of Genesis II appeared on the company&#x27;s website on 29 June 2007. Some of the pictures and other items placed aboard Genesis II as part of the Fly Your Stuff program are clearly visible. Another interior image, apparently taken with more of the spacecraft&#x27;s internal lights activated, was posted on 2 July 2007. Articles from the Fly Your Stuff program are also visible in this image.

Test items, supplied by Bigelow Aerospace employees, were sent into orbit on Genesis I. No new images of items floating inside Genesis I have been released since shortly after the launch and initial activation of the spacecraft due to problems with a computer which controls several of the internal cameras.

==== Galaxy/Guardian ====
==== Sundancer ====
The third planned Bigelow launch, &quot;Sundancer&quot;, was to be equipped with full life-support systems, attitude control, orbital maneuvering systems, and would have been capable of reboost and deorbit burns. Like the &quot;Genesis&quot; pathfinders, &quot;Sundancer&quot;&#x27;s outer surface would have been compacted around its central core, with air expanding it to its full size after entering orbit. After expansion, the module would have measured in length and in diameter, with of interior volume. Unlike previous Bigelow craft, it was planned to have three observation windows. , SpaceX had been contracted to provide a Falcon 9 vehicle for launch of a Bigelow payload in 2011.

In July 2011, Bigelow announced that they will cease development on the Sundancer and instead focus their efforts on the B330.

==== Bigelow Expandable Activity Module for the ISS ====

In December 2012, Bigelow began development work on the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM) under a US$17.8 million NASA contract. After a number of delays, BEAM was transported to ISS arriving on 10 April 2016, inside the unpressurized cargo trunk of a SpaceX Dragon during the SpaceX CRS-8 cargo mission. The mission tested the BEAM module&#x27;s structural integrity, leak rate, radiation dosage and temperature changes over a two-year-long mission. At the end of BEAM&#x27;s mission, the module was planned to be removed from the ISS and burn up during reentry. In October 2017, it was announced that the module would stay attached to the ISS for at least three more years, with options for two further one-year extensions.

==== B330 ====
The B330 is a full-scale production module weighing approximately , with dimensions of approximately in length and in diameter when expanded. Previous names for the B330 were the BA 330 and the Nautilus.

Bigelow has partnered with United Launch Alliance with the goal of launching a B330 module to orbit in 2021, potentially as an addition to the International Space Station. The two companies have also proposed launching a B330 to low lunar orbit in 2022 to serve as a lunar depot. The first B330 launch was originally planned to be launched aboard an Atlas V launch vehicle, but ULA stated in October 2017 that its in-development Vulcan Centaur launch vehicle was the only launch vehicle available with the performance and fairing capacity to carry the module.

==== BA 2100 concept module ====
The BA 2100, or &quot;Olympus&quot; module, is a concept module that would require a heavy-lift launcher and would place in orbit the complete infrastructure of a habitat, over six times as large as the B330. , estimates put the vehicle mass between 90 and 120 metric tonnes, with a diameter of approximately . The concept model shows docking ports at both ends.

==== First Base ====
In June 2019, Bigelow Aerospace introduced the &quot;First Base&quot; concept. First Base is a lunar station module that can accommodate four people; it features four airlocks and two warehouses with solar arrays on top.

=== Delays in launch capability ===
As a result of delays in launch capability to transport humans to the Bigelow habitats, Bigelow &quot;laid off some 40 of its 90 employees&quot; in late September 2011. Bigelow had expected human launch capability by 2014 or 2015 but &quot;the prospect of domestic crew transportation of any kind is apparently going to occur years after the first B330 could be ready. ... For both business and technical reasons, we cannot deploy a B330 without a means of transporting crew to and from our station, and the adjustment to our employment levels was necessary to reflect this reality&quot;.

== Bigelow Commercial Space Station ==
The &quot;Bigelow Next-Generation Commercial Space Station&quot; is a private orbital space complex that was under development by Bigelow. The space station will include both &quot;Sundancer&quot; and B330 expandable spacecraft modules and a central docking node, propulsion, solar arrays, and attached crew capsules. Initial launch of space station components was planned for 2014, with portions of the station available for leased use as early as 2015. Bigelow has publicly shown space station design configurations with up to nine B330 modules containing of habitable space. Bigelow began to publicly refer to the initial configuration – two Sundancer modules and one B330 module – of the first Bigelow station as &quot;Space Complex Alpha&quot; in October 2010.

A second orbital station, &quot;Space Complex Bravo&quot;, was scheduled to begin launches in 2016.

Launches will not commence until there are commercial crew transportation systems operational, which was to be 2017 or later.

Bigelow announced in October 2010 that it has agreements with six sovereign nations to utilize on-orbit facilities of the commercial space station: United Kingdom, Netherlands, Australia, Singapore, Japan and Sweden. By February 2011, this number had risen to seven.

An earlier space station, &quot;CSS Skywalker&quot; (&quot;Commercial Space Station Skywalker&quot;), was Bigelow&#x27;s 2005 concept for the first space hotel. The &quot;Skywalker&quot; was to be composed of multiple Nautilus habitat modules, which would be expanded and connected upon reaching orbit. An MDPM (Multi-Directional Propulsion Module) would allow the &quot;Skywalker&quot; to be moved into interplanetary or lunar trajectories.

In November 2010, Bigelow indicated that the company would like to construct ten or more space stations and that there is a substantial commercial market to support such growth.

== Crew and passenger transport ==
Bigelow&#x27;s business model requires a means of transporting humans to and from low Earth orbit. In 2004, Bigelow established and funded a US$50 million prize, America&#x27;s Space Prize, to stimulate development of crewed vehicles. The prize expired without a winner in early 2010.

In August 2009, Bigelow Aerospace announced the development of the Orion Lite spacecraft, intended to be a lower cost, and less capable version of the Orion spacecraft under development by NASA. The intention would be for Orion Lite to provide access to low earth orbit using either the Atlas V or Falcon 9 launch systems, and carrying a crew of up to 7.

At the time Bigelow Aerospace&#x27;s corporate counsel Mike Gold said: &quot;...we would be foolish to depend completely on one capsule provider or any single launch system&quot;, ... &quot;Therefore, it is vital from both a practical and business perspective to ensure that SpaceX and Dragon aren&#x27;t the only options available to us, hence the need for another capsule&quot;.

, Bigelow was pursuing both launch options of Boeing CST-100 / ULA Atlas V and SpaceX Dragon / Falcon 9 as capsules and launchers. &quot;Bigelow offers Boeing, SpaceX, and other vehicle developers ... the promise of a sustained, large market for space transportation services&quot;. With the initial Space Complex Alpha space station, Bigelow &quot;would need six flights a year; with the launch of a second, larger station, that number would grow to 24, or two a month&quot;.

Bigelow entered NASA&#x27;s Commercial Crew Program (CCP) with the Starliner capsule in collaboration with Boeing. Bigelow worked with Boeing to refine requirements for Starliner, including joint tests in August 2012. Separately, in May 2012, Bigelow and SpaceX teamed up towards joint marketing to international customers of crew transport to the Bigelow B330 space facility.

== Aspirations beyond Earth-orbit ==
In February 2010, following the announcement of NASA&#x27;s post-Augustine Commission plans to reorient human-to-orbit plans more in the direction of commercial launch providers, Robert Bigelow said &quot;We as a company have lunar ambitions, ... and we also have Mars ambitions as well&quot;. In April 2010, Bigelow suggested positioning a space station at the Lagrange point . He also said his proposed private Moon Base would consist of three B330s.

In March 2013, Bigelow signed a contract with NASA to &quot;look at ways for private ventures to contribute to human exploration missions, perhaps including construction of a moon base&quot; and to act as a clearinghouse with other commercial companies to extend commercial activity at conceptual lunar expeditionary bases in ways that are not a mainline part of NASA&#x27;s current focus for human spaceflight, which is asteroid exploration missions.
The Bigelow report released later in 2013 identified &quot;an uncertain regulatory environment as a major obstacle to commercial activities&quot; on the Moon.

In December 2014, the FAA Office of Commercial Space Transportation (AST) completed a review of the proposed Bigelow lunar habitat, and indicated that &quot;it was willing to use its authority to ensure Bigelow could carry out its [lunar] activities ... without interference from other [U.S.] companies licensed by the FAA&quot; [and that the FAA would] use its launch licensing authority, as best it can, to protect private sector assets on the Moon and to provide a safe environment for companies to conduct peaceful commercial activities without fear of harmful interference from other AST licensees&quot;.

== Honors ==
Bigelow Aerospace has received several honors for its spaceflight efforts. On 3 October 2006, Bigelow Aerospace received the Innovator Award from the Arthur C. Clarke Foundation. The award recognizes &quot;initiatives or new inventions that have had recent impact on or hold particular promise for satellite communications and society, and stand as distinguished examples of innovative thinking&quot;. Robert Bigelow was presented the award at the Arthur C. Clarke Awards in Washington, D.C. alongside Walter Cronkite, who was honored on the same night with the Arthur C. Clarke Lifetime Achievement Award.

On 26 January 2007, the Space Foundation announced that Bigelow Aerospace would be the recipient of its 2007 Space Achievement Award. Bigelow Aerospace joins a list of previous winners that include the Titan Launch Vehicle team; The Inertial Upper Stage team, the SpaceShipOne team; the Arianespace-CNES Ariane 4 launch team; the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) teams; the NASA/Industry Galileo space probe team; the Hubble Space Telescope team; Sea Launch; and the NASA/Boeing International Space Station team. The award was presented to Robert Bigelow on 9 April 2007 at the 23rd National Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

<doc id="754131" wikidata="Q1270126" url="?curid=754131" title="Danish Folkeskole Education">
<text>The  (English: &#x27;people&#x27;s school&#x27;) is a type of school in Denmark covering the entire period of compulsory education, from the age of 6 to 16, encompassing pre-school, primary and lower secondary education.

The &quot;Folkeskole&quot; operates under the Danish Folkeskole Act, which outlines shared goals, curriculum requirements, and organizational standards while allowing municipalities to implement local adaptations.

== Historical overview ==

Legend has it that Ansgar, a French Benedictine monk, was the first missionary to visit Denmark around 822, purchased the freedom of twelve male thralls and educated them in the first school in Denmark, at Hedeby in Schleswig. This was the forerunner of the religious houses which sprang forth over the entire country from about 1100 onwards. In their cloisters, boys from surrounding villages — and occasionally girls as well — received elementary instruction in the Mass and in dogma.

However, quite early trade and crafts demanded more practical schools. The primitive writing-and-counting schools had their origins here, usually with very mediocre teachers, but they were very useful and therefore they flourished, maintained by private support and by the guilds.

=== Reformation ===

The Lutheran Reformation came to Denmark from Germany in 1536. As in Germany, Protestants quickly broke up the Catholic school system. The religious houses were closed and the vast estates of the Roman Catholic Church taken over by the Crown. This meant that the state also took over such tasks as education.

The Church Law of 1539 contains Denmark&#x27;s first educational legislation with a formal requirement for schools in all provincial boroughs. While new grammar schools sprang up, laying the foundation of classically humanism among the higher strata of society, the broad masses had to be content with the old Danish schools or writing schools which provided a primitive form of instruction.

A substantial stride was taken in the direction of popular education in 1721, when King Frederick IV established 240 schoolhouses bearing the royal insignia and called them Cavalry schools after a division of the country into military districts. At the same time, the new religious movement of Pietism was spreading from Germany to Denmark. It aroused among church people a sense of responsibility towards forthcoming generations and enjoyed royal support. A series of calls by the church for universal confirmation which could only be met by some degree of literacy, brought many new schools into existence. Thus, a limited kind of compulsory education was formally introduced.

However, it was the &#x27;philanthropic&#x27; movement, a very active current of educational thought inspired by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in the second half of the 18th century, that first succeeded in creating a real school for ordinary people, open to all children.

Planned training of teachers developed in parsonages and state training colleges, and two Education Acts were enacted in 1814, introducing better municipal primary schools and independent schools for children in rural areas all over Denmark.

When a prolonged agricultural crisis and economic slump after the Napoleonic Wars threatened to cripple the entire educational reform programme, the government had to resort to a distressingly mechanical method of education, the so-called Bell-Lancaster method imported from the industrial north of England, which reduced the number of teachers by a drastic simplification of the curriculum to enable preposterously large numbers of pupils to be taught by a single individual. After some years, this method provoked increasing opposition from parents, who wanted more liberal and inspiring forms of education. Their demands received vigorous support from the poet-clergyman N. F. S. Grundtvig, who exercised a powerful influence on the development of Danish schools. Grundtvig wanted to reduce the task of children&#x27;s schools to no more than the teaching of reading, writing and arithmetic in order to make room, either at home or at school, for a liberal narrative education that would build on the natural potential for development inherent in the child&#x27;s mind.

Grundtvig&#x27;s ideas were translated into practice by Christen Kold, who created a distinctively Danish parent-controlled school known as the free school as an alternative to state-sponsored education, exercising a growing influence over the latter&#x27;s mode of functioning.

The Education Act of 1894 improved teacher training in several important respects. As Danish agriculture continued to modernise and Danish society continued to urbanise, new Education Acts were brought forth around 1900, which changed the Danish basic school by expanding its curriculum. A four-year middle school for students over 11 years of age was established in 1903 to form a bridge between the folkeskole and the realskole (lower secondary school) and the gymnasium. The middle schools rapidly attained great popularity, and over the next half-century, large numbers of children and young people used them as a stepping stone to upper secondary education.

The strong attraction to the upper classes to the folkeskole gradually weakened. Since the conception of the welfare state was intensifying the demand for social equality and democratisation, middle schools were reorganised in 1958 to include two academic paths: a three-year academically oriented real department and the 8th–10th forms.

=== Modern form ===

New acts in 1937, 1958, and 1975 reflected the demands of a new age in terms of equal access to all forms of education. The act of 1975 abolished the real-department and introduced two completely new examinations: the Exit Examination of the Folkeskole and the Advanced Exit Examination of the Folkeskole held on a single-subject basis.

A new act in 1990 introduced new provisions regarding the administration of the schools with more managerial competence vested in the headteacher and the setting up of school boards with large parental representation. Finally, another act that came into force in 1994 stipulated that the folkeskole give a student the opportunity to develop as many of their talents as possible. One of the watchwords of the new act is differentiated teaching, or that teaching should be adapted as much as possible to the individual student.

== Types of institutions ==
There are different ways of meeting the rules pertaining to compulsory education: by attending the municipal folkeskole, a private school, by home tuition, or as far as the last two to three years of the basic school are concerned by attending one of the alternative school forms: the &quot;efterskole&quot;, or the youth schools.

=== Municipal ===
Municipal s have about 88% of all pupils of compulsory school age. They provide basic education free of charge to children between the ages of seven and sixteen, or through the voluntary pre-school, the nine years of compulsory education, to the voluntary tenth year.

There are three different types of s, those with a pre-school and 1st–10th form levels, those with a pre-school and 1st-7th form levels, and those with only three or more consecutive form levels. The latter may be placed under the management of another school unless the enrollment is more than 100.

Compulsory education can thus not be met fully in the second or third type of schools, and students of such schools have to switch schools after the 7th form. The first type of school is common in areas with a large pupil-basis, whereas more thinly populated municipalities may have a number of the second and third type school and only one or two of the first type. The smallest school has six students and the largest 892, with the average school containing 320 pupils (1999).

==== Admission requirements ====
Any child resident in Denmark is subject to 10 years of compulsory education from the age of six to sixteen. The first year is pre-school, referred to as kindergarten class or 0th form. An additional non-compulsory 10th form is offered at many schools. Children who are to live in Denmark for a minimum of six months are subject to the regulations on compulsory education. Compulsory education means an obligation to participate in the teaching of the folkeskole or in a teaching which is comparable to what is usually required in the folkeskole.

Compulsory education commences on 1 August of the calendar year of the child&#x27;s 6th birthday, and it terminates on 31 July, when the child has received regular instruction for 10 years. At the request of the parents or with their consent, a child&#x27;s education may be postponed to one year after the normal commencement of compulsory education, when such a step is justified by the child&#x27;s development. A child may also – at the request of their parents, and if they are considered able to follow the instruction – be admitted before their sixth birthday.

=== Private schools ===
As of 2013, private, or free elementary, schools cater to 15.6% of students in 2004–2005 of basic school age, having risen from 12.9% of students in 2004–2005.

In the spring of 1991, the Danish Parliament adopted a new private school act, which introduced a new public grant system for private schools giving them a grant towards the operational expenditures per pupil per year, which in principle matches the corresponding public expenditures in the municipal schools - less the fees paid by the parents of the pupils in the private schools.

In 1999, the average grant towards the operational expenditures per pupil per year amounted to DKK 34,134 (US$5,500) and the average fees paid by the parents amounted to DKK 6,942 (US$1,100).

Private schools can be roughly divided into the following categories:

* Small &quot;Grundtvigian&quot; independent schools in rural districts.
* Religious or congregational schools, such as Catholic, Inner Mission, or Muslim schools
* Progressive free schools
* International schools such as Copenhagen International School
* Schools with a particular pedagogical objective, such as the Waldorf schools
* German minority schools

Private schools are recognised and receive government financing regardless of the ideological, religious, political, or ethnic motivation behind their establishment. Some private schools are very old, some quite new, and new ones are added all the time. It is characteristic of the private schools that they are smaller than municipal schools.

All that is demanded of private schools is that their teaching equal that of the municipal schools. The Ministry of Education confers on private schools the right to use the final examinations of the folkeskole, thereby exercising a certain extent of quality control. In principle, however, it is not up to any government authority but to the parents of each private school to check that its performance measures up to the demands set for the municipal schools.

The parents must themselves choose a supervisor to check the pupils&#x27; level of achievement in Danish, arithmetic, mathematics, and English. If the school is found inadequate, the supervisor must report it to the municipal school authority. In extraordinary circumstances, the Ministry of Education may establish special supervision, for example if there is reason to believe that the school teaches a subject so poorly that it may give the pupils problems later on in life.

Educational experts say the rise in use of private schools in the 2000s is partly due to white Danish families putting their children in private schools when the neighbouring public school gets more than 30% pupils of immigrant background. About 24% of pupils grade 1–3 in Copenhagen attend private schools. Another factor is parents in small communities who have organized to start a private school when small public schools have closed as a results of the Danish municipality reform which led to fewer municipalities.

=== Levels and age groups ===
The consists of an obligatory pre-school class, the nine-year obligatory course and a voluntary eleventh year. It thus caters for pupils aged six to seventeen.

The comprehensive concept of the folkeskole enables students to remain in the same student group with the same classmates from the 1st to the 10th (or 11th) form, sharing the same experiences in all subjects with peers of all types of backgrounds and covering the whole range of ability.

The new act, which came into effect for the school year 1994–1995, has abolished the division of the subjects of arithmetic, mathematics, English, German, physics, and chemistry into basic and advanced level courses in the 8th to 10th forms, introducing a system of differentiated teaching, by which the teachers have to adapt their teaching to the prerequisites of the individual pupil.

=== General objectives ===
Section 1 of the Act of the Folkeskole of 1994 states that:

&quot;The shall — in co-operation with the parents — further the pupils&#x27; acquisition of knowledge, skills, working methods and ways of expressing themselves and thus contribute to the all-round personal development of the individual pupil.

&quot;The shall endeavour to create such opportunities for experience, industry and absorption that the pupils develop awareness, imagination and an urge to learn, so that they acquire confidence in their own possibilities and a background for forming independent judgements and for taking personal action.

&quot;The shall familiarise the pupils with Danish culture and contribute to their understanding of other cultures and of man&#x27;s interaction with nature. The school shall prepare the pupils for active participation, joint responsibility, rights and duties in a society based on freedom and democracy. The teaching of the school and its daily life must therefore build on intellectual freedom, equality and democracy.&quot;

== Subjects of the ==
The subjects taught in the can be divided into obligatory subjects and topics offered throughout the entire period of the and optional subjects and topics offered in the 8th to 10th years.

=== Mandatory subjects ===
The teaching in the nine-year basic school covers the following subjects which are compulsory for all pupils:

Danish, Christian studies — including in the oldest forms instruction in foreign religions and other philosophies of life, PE and sport, and mathematics during the entire nine-year period; English and history from the third to the ninth year; music from the first to the sixth year; science from the first to the sixth year; art from the first to the fifth year; social studies from the eighth to the ninth year; geography and biology from the seventh to the ninth year; physics and chemistry in the seventh to ninth year; needlework, wood- or metalworking and cooking for one or more years between the fourth and seventh year.

The instruction in the basic school furthermore comprises the following obligatory topics: traffic safety, health and sex education and family planning as well as educational, vocational and labour market orientation.

=== Optional subjects ===
The second foreign language, German or French, must be offered in the seventh to tenth years.

The following optional subjects and topics may be offered to the pupils in the eighth to tenth years: French or German as a third foreign language, word processing, technology, media, art, photography, film, drama, music, needlework, wood- or metalwork, home economics, engine knowledge, other workshop subjects, and vocational studies. Furthermore, Latin may be offered to the pupils in the tenth year.

The teaching in the 10th form comprises the following subjects as obligatory subjects: Danish, mathematics, and English to an extent corresponding to a total of 14 lessons a week (i.e. half of the minimum weekly teaching time). Instruction must be offered in PE and sport, Christian studies and religious education, social studies and physics or chemistry. Furthermore, pupils who have chosen German or French as a second foreign language in the seventh to ninth years must be offered continued instruction in that subject in the tenth year.

The pupils in the eighth to tenth years must choose at least one optional subject.

===Subjects===
The basic subjects are Danish, religious studies, mathematics, art, history, music, physical education, English and science. Later classes are home economics, chemistry, social studies, needlework, woodworking, physics, geography and biology.

== Pupil evaluation ==
There are two ways of carrying out evaluation in the : continuous evaluation and evaluation through examinations.

=== Continuous evaluation ===
The students benefit from the teaching is being evaluated on a continuous basis. This evaluation forms the basis of the guidance of the individual pupil with a view to the further planning of the teaching.

In addition to the basic skills, the is required by law to help promote the personal and social development of each individual student according to their capability. Working methods are modified towards the pupil&#x27;s attainment of greater self-reliance and maturity. This aspect of pedagogic policy requires close co-operation between school and home, and an ongoing dialogue is sought between teachers, parents and pupils.

The act is very clear on this point, requiring that pupils and parents be regularly informed of the school&#x27;s opinion about how each student is profiting from their schooling. In this case, regularly means at least twice a year and refers explicitly to information as to the student&#x27;s personal and social development as well as his purely academic attainment.

In the first to eighth years, information is given either in writing or, more commonly, as part of conferences between all three parties: pupil, parents and class teacher – which are a regular feature of Danish school life.

In the ninth to eleventh years, the information system is increased to include a written report at least twice a year giving the pupil&#x27;s standpoint in academic achievement and in application. For pupils at this level, the evaluation of the level of attainment in the individual subjects is expressed in marks.

Marks are given according to the seven-point marking scale indicating the performance of the pupil:

* 12: Excellent performance
* 10: Very good performance
* 7: Good performance
* 4: Fair performance
* 02: Adequate performance
* 00: Inadequate performance
* -3: Unacceptable performance

The last such marks are given immediately before the written examinations and express the pupils&#x27; proficiency in the subject at that particular time.

The marking scale was changed April 2007 (order by Danish ministry of Education, Order no. 262 of 20 March 2007), to be comparable to the ECTS grading scale:

* The grade 12 on the 7-point grading scale corresponds to an A on the ECTS scale
* The grade 10 on the 7-point grading scale corresponds to a B on the ECTS scale
* The grade 7 on the 7-point grading scale corresponds to a C on the ECTS scale
* The grade 4 on the 7-point grading scale corresponds to a D on the ECTS scale
* The grade 02 on the 7-point grading scale corresponds to an E on the ECTS scale
* The grade 00 on the 7-point grading scale corresponds to an Fx on the ECTS scale
* The grade -3 on the 7-point grading scale corresponds to an F on the ECTS scale

=== Examinations ===
Examinations are held at two levels: the leaving examination after the 10th and 11th year and the 11th form examination. Standard rules have been developed for all the examinations with a view to ensuring uniformity throughout the country. For the same reason, the written examination questions are set and marked at central level. Examinations are not compulsory. The pupils decide whether or not to sit for examinations in a subject upon consultation with the school, or in practice, their own teachers and their parents. But, in general 90–95% write the leaving examination after the 10th year of the and 85–90% write the leaving examination after the 11th year.

<doc id="754133" wikidata="Q299364" url="?curid=754133" title="Nikolai Vatutin">
<text>Nikolai Fyodorovich Vatutin (; 16 December 1901 – 15 April 1944) was a Soviet military commander during World War II who was responsible for many Red Army operations in the Ukrainian SSR as the commander of the Southwestern Front, and of the Voronezh Front during the Battle of Kursk. During the Soviet offensive to retake right-bank Ukraine, Vatutin led the 1st Ukrainian Front, which was responsible for the Red Army&#x27;s offensives to the west and the southwest of Kiev and the eventual liberation of the city. 

He was ambushed and mortally wounded in February 1944 by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army.

== Early life ==
Vatutin was born in Chepukhino village in the Valuysky Uyezd, Voronezh Governorate (named Vatutino, Belgorod Oblast after him in 1968), into a peasant family of Russian ethnicity.

== Pre-war military service ==
Commissioned in 1920 to the Red Army, he fought against the peasant partisans of the anarchist Nestor Makhno. The following year, he became a member of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and served diligently in junior command positions. From 1926, he spent the next decade alternating service with studies in the elite Frunze Military Academy and the General Staff Academy. The 1937–1938 purge of Red Army commanders opened the road to his promotion. In 1938, he received the rank of Komdiv, and he was appointed Chief of Staff of the important Kiev Special Military District. Throughout that period, Vatutin combined military service with intensive party activities.

In 1939, Vatutin planned operations for the Soviet invasion of Poland in conjunction with the German invasion. He served as Chief of Staff of the Red Army Southern Group. In 1940, under the command of Georgy Zhukov, that group seized Bessarabia from Romania. As a reward for the non-combat campaigns, Joseph Stalin promoted him to the rank of lieutenant general and appointed him to the critical post of Chief of the Operational Directorate of the General Staff. Vatutin was, however, not up to his new appointment. While innovative and hard-working, he lacked any combat experience, and his knowledge of operational art and strategy was too abstract. Still, his peasant roots, relative youthful age and party zeal made him one of Stalin&#x27;s few favorites in the Soviet military. Vatutin, together with the rest of the Red Army high command, failed to prepare the army for the German attack of 22 June 1941.

On 30 June 1941, he was appointed Chief of Staff of the North-Western Front, which enabled him to exercise his better qualities. In that role, Vatutin did not try to claim success for himself in battles, but he made a point of identifying and promoting talented subordinates. He was notable for his audacity. Most of the Soviet generals, shattered by defeats, were then reluctant to carry out offensive operations, but Vatutin thrived on attack.

== The Battles in North ==

The Northwestern Front was defending Leningrad from the approaches by the German Army Group North, spearheaded by the armored corps led by Erich von Manstein. Vatutin took command of the Soviet forces near Novgorod, rallied them for offense, and attempted to encircle a large German force. He surprised Manstein, put him on the defensive, and forced the entire German Army Group North to regroup its troops to halt the Soviet offensive. The Wehrmacht lost the precious summer season needed for an effective attack on Leningrad, and the Red Army got additional time to strengthen the fortifications of the city. The Germans thus failed in their best shot to capture Leningrad, one of the key German strategic failures during the early phase of war. Vatutin&#x27;s immediate operational results were far less impressive. He overestimated the capacities of his troops and created overly ambitious objectives, and his coordination of his forces and control over the unfolding of the battle were poor. Additionally, he did not take into account the difficult terrain, which benefited the German defenses and slowed his attack. Vatutin&#x27;s casualty figures were staggering and in one army reached nearly 60%. The ineptitude of his subordinate commanders exacerbated Vatutin&#x27;s own shortcomings. One striking exception to that pattern of deficiency was the brilliance of Ivan Chernyakhovsky, an obscure young colonel in command of the 28th Tank Division. Both men had much in common, most prominently their penchant for unorthodox approaches to military art, and soon became close friends.

In January 1942, during the Soviet winter offensive after the Red Army victory at the Battle of Moscow, Vatutin&#x27;s forces trapped two German corps in Demyansk and achieved the first large Soviet encirclement of German forces. The German and the Soviet Armies were equal in size. During the battle, Vatutin employed innovative tactics and actions, but the Germans responded more conventionally. The Red Army was unable to destroy the German defenses, mainly because of the weakness of the Soviet Air Force.

In April 1942, Vatutin finally breached the German lines just as a German relief force arrived. However, post-war American experts have evaluated the result of that operation as a draw. The German command drew self-congratulatory and misleading lessons from their narrow escape by concluding that they could overcome Soviet encirclements with supplies from the air while mounting a relief operation. That thinking contributed to the Wehrmacht&#x27;s disaster at the Battle of Stalingrad since the Soviet Air Force proved much more capable of disrupting the Luftwaffe&#x27;s resupply efforts.

== Voronezh and Stalingrad ==
From early May to July 1942, Vatutin served briefly as deputy of the Chief of the General Staff of the Red Army until the German Army Group South embarked on its huge strategic offense, Operation Blau. Initially, the Germans&#x27; assault focused on Voronezh. They wanted to breach the Soviet front line at the Battle of Voronezh and then to attack the Soviet Southern Front and the Southwestern Front from the rear. On 1 July 1942, Stalin sent Vatutin as an all-powerful Stavka representative to the critical Bryansk Front; within a few days, it was renamed as Voronezh Front and placed under Vatutin&#x27;s command.

During the battle, Vatutin again met Chernyakhovsky, who had just been appointed commander of the 18th Tank Corps of the 60th Army. The German attack was on the verge of breaching the Soviet front line when Cherniakhovsky&#x27;s corps arrived by train. He unloaded one of his brigades and, without waiting for the rest of his troops, led that brigade against the German forces, and threw them back. After that action, Vatutin asked Stalin to give command of the 60th army to Cherniakhovsky. Initially, Stalin opposed the request, mostly because he had reservations about appointing such a young general to lead a field army. However, Vatutin finally convinced Stalin to promote Cherniakhovsky, who would rapidly rise to become one of the major Red Army field commanders.

Although the Germans captured the city, their attempt to breach Vatutin&#x27;s front line failed. The Germans abandoned their initial plan and shifted their efforts toward Stalingrad. On 22 October 1942, Vatutin received command of the newly-formed Southwestern Front and played an important role in planning the Soviet counter-offensive and the encirclement of the German 6th Army in the Battle of Stalingrad. In December 1942, to secure the Soviet ring around Stalingrad, Vatutin&#x27;s forces encircled and destroyed two thirds of the 130,000-strong Italian 8th Army in operation Little Saturn. That contributed to the defeat of Manstein&#x27;s Operation Wintergewitter (&quot;Winter Storm&quot;), the relief effort for the 6th Army.

== Kharkov and Kursk ==
In January 1943, Vatutin&#x27;s Southwest Front drove the Germans from Eastern Ukraine. His actions enabled the Voronezh Front under General Filipp Golikov to capture Kharkov, but he had overextended his depleted troops and not paid sufficient attention to the changing strategic situation. In February 1943, Manstein, using the forces extricated from the Caucasus, took advantage of Vatutin&#x27;s lapse in situational awareness and managed to surprise and to defeat Vatutin south of Kharkov, which led to the encirclement of Golikov&#x27;s advance troops in Kharkov and the recapture of the city at the Third Battle of Kharkov. The Stavka removed Golikov from his command but did not see Vatutin&#x27;s debacle as significant. Vatutin&#x27;s audacity made Stalin award him the rank of Army General.

On 28 March 1943, Vatutin took command of the Voronezh Front, which was preparing for the momentous Battle of Kursk. At Kursk, he rejected conventional echeloning of armies, and his innovative deployment allowed him to not only conduct a skillful defence against the technically superior Germans, but also gave him the opportunity to quickly switch from defense to offense. Following the Soviet victory at Kursk, Belgorod was recaptured.

== Recapture of Kiev and Korsun-Cherkassy Pocket ==
After the Soviet victory at Kursk, Vatutin now aspired to retake Kiev. He regrouped his forces and surprised Manstein by sweeping tank forces through swampland and scattering the Germans from the unexpected direction. On 6 November 1943, Kiev was retaken. Vatutin relentlessly exploited his victory in Kiev, pushed deep into the German defenses, and destroyed the German defensive line. However, Vatutin overextended his armies, and Manstein used his reserve forces in the XLVIII Panzerkorps to counterattack. At the Battle of Radomyshl (6–15 November 1943) and the Battle of the Meleni Pocket (16–23 December 1943), Manstein unleashed successful counter-attacks, which took terrain back and inflicted heavy losses on the Red Army&#x27;s forces.

Regaining the initiative in winter weather, Vatutin&#x27;s front and the 2nd Ukrainian Front of Army General Ivan Konev carried out in January the sudden encirclement of the Korsun salient at the Dnieper River during the Korsun–Shevchenkovsky Offensive. Although Vatutin started the operation two days after Konev and his striking formation, and the 6th Tank Army had been only recently formed, Vatutin achieved the element of surprise by committing his tanks to the battle from the first echelon and once again attacking from unexpected terrain. That allowed the 6th Tank Army to penetrate deep into German defenses, and on 3 February, it linked with the advancing armor of Konev&#x27;s front and trapped 56,000 German troops. By 17 February, Vatutin and Konev&#x27;s forces had eliminated the Korsun-Cherkassy Pocket, but many of the encircled troops had managed to escape.

== Death ==
On 28 February 1944, Vatutin, regrouping for a new operation and heading to Slavuta (Khmelnytskyi Oblast), was ambushed by Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) insurgents far behind the front lines near the village of Myliatyn in Ostroh Raion (Rivne Oblast). He died of sepsis, caused by the injuries, in a hospital at Kiev six weeks later. Vatutin&#x27;s brothers, Afanasy Fyodorovich and Semyon Fyodorovich, were killed in action in February and March 1944. Their mother, Vera Yefimovna, buried her three sons in two months.

Nikolai Vatutin was given a state funeral in Kiev and was succeeded by Georgy Zhukov.

After the war, the Chekists documented two more versions of the attack on Vatutin. During one of the Chekist operations, on January 15, 1946, Fedir Vorobets (Vereshchak), the former commander of the &quot;Tiutiunnyk&quot; UPA group, was captured. During one of the interrogations, he said that the attack on Nikolai Vatutin had taken place in the area of Sotnia of Derkach and had been one by units of the Sluzhba Bezpeky (OUN Security Service) in the villages of Mikhalkivtsi and Siancy of Ostrovsky district of Rivne region. According to various sources, 17 to 27 fighters took part in the operation.

Another version of Vatutin&#x27;s death was told in the 1990s by the UPA veteran Yevhen Basyuk (&quot;Chernomorets&quot;). According to him, a detachment of 30 people under the command of Primak (&quot;Troian&quot;) took part in the clash with the general&#x27;s bodyguard. When the column appeared, the UPA soldiers unloaded the carts of the convoy, which had been seized from the Red Army, and the carts opened fire spontaneously without any ambush.

Vatutin was buried in Kiev&#x27;s Mariinskyi Park near the Ukrainian Parliament. A monument dedicated to him was erected at his burial site in 1948. This monument was designed by a prominent Soviet sculptor Yevgeny Vuchetich. The Kyiv City State Administration dismantled the Vatutin monument on 9 February 2023. In June 2017, the Kyiv City Council had already renamed the city&#x27;s General Vatutin Avenue into Roman Shukhevych Avenue. During the war Shukhevych fought against Soviet forces, first being a company commander and the highest-ranking Ukrainian officer in the Nachtigall Battalion, then serving as an officer in the Schutzmannschaft Battalion 201, and later becoming one of the military leaders of UPA.

==Legacy==
His influence on the Red Army strategic planning, operational, and tactical techniques continued even after his death. After the Cold War, a decline in Germanocentric analyses of the Eastern Front has made Vatutin win recognition among Western military experts as one of World War II&#x27;s most creative commanders:At Kursk, Vatutin was able to stop Manstein&#x27;s powerful armoured spearheads well short of their objectives and then shift to a counteroffensive that shattered the German front. Vatutin surprised Manstein at Belgorod in August and thoroughly outmanoeuvred him at Kiev in December. Vatutin demonstrated great flexibility during the Korsun offensive, taking advantage of fleeting opportunities rather than reinforcing failure, which resulted in his armour encircling two German corps. However, Vatutin was unable to prevent Manstein from relieving the Korsun Pocket, but this limited success squandered Manstein&#x27;s last operational reserves. Vatutin would surely have played a major role in finishing off Manstein&#x27;s command in the Kamenets-Podolsky offensive if Ukrainian partisans had not fatally wounded him after Korsun. Nevertheless, Vatutin had demonstrated that Manstein&#x27;s style of &quot;Bewegungskrieg&quot; did not work against a steady opponent and that the Red Army had some commanders who could turn the tables and conduct a form of manoeuvre warfare that astonished even Manstein.

In November 2014, the Ukrainian Institute of National Memory included Vatutin on the list of &#x27;persons involved in the struggle against Ukraine&#x27;s independence, the organization of famines, and political repressions.&#x27;

On 9 February 2023, a monument to Vatutin atop his grave in Kyiv&#x27;s Mariinskyi Park was dismantled and relocated to the local Aviation Museum. Also in February 2023, the village of Vatutine in northeastern Ukraine, previously named for Vatutin, was set to be renamed &quot;Zaluzhne&quot;, after Ukrainian general Valerii Zaluzhnyi. On 11 November 2023 the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine removed the status of monument from the grave of Vatutin that was still existing at the feet of the then already removed monument in order to comply with 2023 derussification-laws.

In April 2023 the Poltava City Council voted to dismantle the monument to Vatutin in this city.

<text>State Route 85 (SR 85) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Arizona. The highway runs from the United States–Mexico border near Lukeville to the north ending at Interstate 10 (I-10) in Buckeye. The highway also intersects I-8 in Gila Bend and serves as a connector between I-8 and I-10 and for travelers between Phoenix and Yuma as well as San Diego. SR 85 between I-10 and I-8, as well as I-8 between SR 85 and I-10 in Casa Grande, is touted as a bypass of the Phoenix area for long-distance travelers on I-10.

SR 85 was established in 1936 as a route between Gila Bend and Ajo. It was extended southward to the Mexican border in 1955, and was extended northward to Phoenix when it replaced U.S. Route 80 (US 80) in 1977. The northern end of the highway was realigned in 1994 onto the connecting highway between I-10 and Buckeye. The remaining portion of the highway between Buckeye and Phoenix was gradually turned over to the cities and county along the route during the 1990s, with the final portion turned over in 2001.

==Route description==

The southern terminus of SR 85 is located at the Mexican border near Lukeville in Pima County. From Lukeville to Why, SR 85 is designated the Organ Pipe Cactus Parkway by ADOT. The road continues across the border into Mexico to the town of Sonoyta as Mexican Federal Highway 8. SR 85 heads north from the border as a two-lane road, passing through the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. The highway leaves the monument boundary and heads to a junction with SR 86 in Why. SR 86 heads east from this junction towards Tucson and southeastern Arizona. SR 85 heads northwest from this junction to the town of Ajo. From Ajo, the highway heads north and enters the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range. While within the range, the highway enters Maricopa County. After the highway passes through the range, it continues towards the north to a junction with I-8 in Gila Bend. After passing I-8, the highway intersects the business loop of I-8 and turns towards the east to run concurrently with business loop along Pima Street in Gila Bend. The two highways split, with the business loop heading towards the southeast and SR 85 heading northeast providing access to Gila Bend Municipal Airport

SR 85 continues north from Gila Bend towards the Phoenix Metropolitan Area. The mileposts north of Gila Bend reflect the mileage of old US 80 in proximity to the California state line. This stretch of highway north of Gila Bend is a part of the National Highway System. The highway passes near the western edge of the Sonoran Desert National Monument and also provides access to the Buckeye Hills Regional Park. SR 85 continues northward to a crossing of the Gila River as it nears Buckeye. The highway intersects Buckeye Road which is where the original routing of US 80 and later SR 85 followed into Phoenix before being rerouted onto its current alignment. The highway continues towards the north, crossing over the Buckeye Canal before reaching its northern terminus at exit 112 on I-10.

==History==
The first numbered highway along the SR 85 corridor was established in 1927 between Gila Bend and Phoenix as US 80. At the time, it was only paved from Phoenix to Hassayampa. Although not paved between Hassayampa and Gila Bend, it was an improved road. This original routing of US 80 still exists as Old US 80 west of the SR 85 alignment. A dirt road between Gila Bend and Ajo did exist at this time, but it was not a part of the state highway system. By 1935, the entire route of US 80 between Gila Bend and Phoenix had been paved. The road south of Gila Bend had also been improved to a gravel road.

In 1936, SR 85 was established, but it only extended as far north as Gila Bend and as far south as Ajo. By 1938, SR 85 had been paved as well as the portion between Ajo and Why that would eventually become part of SR 85. The portion between Why and the border with Mexico began showing up on maps at this time as a gravel road. In 1943, the portion of the highway between Ajo and Why was added to the state highway system, but as SR 86, when it was extended west from Tucson to Ajo. In 1955, the highway was extended to Lukeville at the Mexican border with an overlap with SR 86 between Ajo and Why when a county road was added to SR 85.

In 1973, the connector between I-10 and Buckeye Road was established, and was redesignated in 1978 as a spur route of SR 85. As the old, indirect US 80 was removed from Arizona, SR 85 was extended north in 1977 over the old alignment of US 80 to Buckeye and extended east to Phoenix. Portions of the route in Buckeye and Phoenix were turned over to their respective cities for maintenance in 1990. The following year, a portion of the highway between Avondale and Phoenix was turned over to Maricopa County for maintenance. (This portion is designated today as MC 85). Also in 1991, the overlap between SR 85 and SR 86 was eliminated and the western terminus of SR 86 was changed to its junction with Route 85 in Why. In 1994, the northern end of SR 85 was moved onto the SR 85 Spur that connected to I-10 and the remaining portions along the old alignment to the east were redesignated as a temporary route of SR 85. In 1999, the portion of the old route in Avondale was turned over to the city for maintenance. The portion of the old route around the state capitol complex, the last remaining section of the old route between Phoenix and Buckeye, was turned over to the city of Phoenix in 2001.

==Future==

The segment of SR 85 between Buckeye and Gila Bend is a connector between I-8 and I-10, and serves both as a connector from I-8 from San Diego, California to Phoenix. This segment is being upgraded to a divided highway, and is planned to become a freeway from I-10 to SR-30. Most of the four-lane road upgrades have already been completed.

In 2010, an environmental study into building a freeway-to-freeway interchange in Gila Bend from SR 85 to I-8 was completed by ADOT and the Federal Highway Administration. The study found no significant impact on the local environment and outlined a finalized full freeway standard design, bypassing the I-8 Business/Maricopa Road intersection SR 85 currently traverses through. A diamond interchange (Exit 121) is planned at Maricopa Road/I-8 Business along with a second diamond interchange slightly northeast of the proposed Exit 121.

<text>Vazgen I also Vazken I of Bucharest (), born Levon Garabed Baljian (; September 20, 1908 – August 18, 1994) was the Catholicos of All Armenians between 1955 and 1994, for a total of 39 years, the 4th longest reign in the history of the Armenian Apostolic Church. 

A native of Romania, he began his career as a philosopher, before becoming a Doctor of Theology and a member of the local Armenian clergy. The leader of the Armenian Apostolic Church hierarchy in Romania, he became Catholicos in 1955, moving to Soviet Armenia. Vazgen I led the Armenian Church during the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and was the first Catholicos in newly independent Armenia.

==Biography==
Vazgen was born in Bucharest to a family belonging to the Armenian-Romanian community. His father was a shoemaker and his mother was a schoolteacher. The young Levon Baljian did not initially pursue the Church as a profession, instead graduating from the University of Bucharest&#x27;s Faculty of Philosophy and Letters. After graduation, he became a philosopher and published a series of scholarly articles.

As his interests began to shift from philosophy to theology, Baljian studied Armenian Apostolic Theology and Divinity in Athens, Greece. He eventually gained the title of &quot;vardapet&quot;, an ecclesiastical rank for learned preachers and teachers in the Armenian Apostolic Church roughly equivalent to receiving a doctorate in theology. In the 1940s, he became a bishop, and then the &quot;arajnord&quot; (leader) of the Armenian Apostolic Church in Romania.

His rise through the hierarchy of the Church culminated in 1955 when, on September 30, 1955, he was elected Catholicos of All Armenians, becoming one of the youngest Catholicoi in the history of the Armenian Apostolic Church. He reigned until his death in 1994. In 1965, he attended the Conference of Addis Ababa, in order to strengthen ties to the other Miaphysite churches. During his long time as Catholicos, he managed to assert some independence for his church in face of the Soviet rule in the Armenian SSR, and lived to see religious freedom restored under Armenia&#x27;s national government in 1991.

From then on, he was busy renewing ancient Armenian churches and reviving institutions of the church. He saved a number of church treasures by establishing the Alex Manoogian Museum of the Mother Church. Vazgen intensified contacts with the Armenian Catholic Church, with the aim of reuniting both wings of Armenian Christianity.

He died at his residence in Yerevan on August 18, 1994, after a long illness from cancer.

<doc id="754147" wikidata="Q536558" url="?curid=754147" title="Oswald Veblen">
<text>Oswald Veblen (June 24, 1880 – August 10, 1960) was an American mathematician, geometer and topologist, whose work found application in atomic physics and the theory of relativity. He proved the Jordan curve theorem in 1905; while this was long considered the first rigorous proof of the theorem, many now also consider Camille Jordan&#x27;s original proof rigorous.

==Early life==
Veblen was born in Decorah, Iowa. His parents were Andrew Anderson Veblen (1848–1932), Professor of Physics at the University of Iowa, and Kirsti (Hougen) Veblen (1851–1908). Veblen&#x27;s uncle was Thorstein Veblen, noted economist and sociologist.

Oswald went to school in Iowa City. He did his undergraduate studies at the University of Iowa, where he received an AB in 1898, and Harvard University, where he was awarded a second BA in 1900. For his graduate studies, he went to study mathematics at the University of Chicago, where he obtained a PhD in 1903. His dissertation, &quot;A System of Axioms for Geometry&quot; was written under the supervision of E. H. Moore. During World War I, Veblen served first as a captain, later as a major in the United States Army.

==Career==
Veblen taught mathematics at Princeton University from 1905 to 1932. In 1926, he was named Henry B. Fine Professor of Mathematics. In 1932, he helped organize the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, resigning his professorship to become the first professor at the Institute that same year. He kept his professorship at the Institute until he was made emeritus in 1950.

During his years in Princeton, Veblen and his wife, Elizabeth M D Richardson, accumulated land along the Princeton Ridge. In 1957 they donated to establish the Herrontown Woods Arboretum, the first and one of the largest nature preserves in Princeton, New Jersey.

Veblen was a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in 1928 in Bologna and in 1936 in Oslo.

Veblen died in Brooklin, Maine, in 1960 at age 80. After his death the American Mathematical Society created an award in his name, called the Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry. It is awarded every three years, and is the most prestigious award in recognition of outstanding research in geometry.

==Accomplishments==
During his career, Veblen made important contributions in topology and in projective and differential geometries, including results important in modern physics. He introduced the Veblen axioms for projective geometry and proved the Veblen–Young theorem. He introduced the Veblen functions of ordinals and used an extension of them to define the small and large Veblen ordinals. In World War II he was involved in overseeing ballistics work at the Aberdeen Proving Ground that involved early modern computing machines, in particular supporting the proposal for creation of the pioneering ENIAC electronic digital computer. He also published a paper in 1912 on the four-color conjecture.

Veblen was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1912, the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1919, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1923.

==Personal life==
In 1908, he married Elizabeth Richardson, the sister of British physicist Owen Willans Richardson and sister-in-law of American physicist Clinton Joseph Davisson.

==Veblen Research Instructorship==
The Veblen Research Instructorship is a three-year position offered by the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study. This position was established in 1998 and offered each year to outstanding candidates in pure and applied mathematics who have received their PhD within the last three years.

The Veblen instructors are Members of the Institute for Advanced Study and regular faculty members at Princeton University. The first and third year of the instructorship are spent at Princeton University and carry regular teaching responsibilities. The second year is spent at the Institute and dedicated to independent research of the instructor&#x27;s choice.

<text>Cincinnati Gardens was an indoor arena located in Cincinnati, Ohio, that opened in 1949. The 25,000 square foot (2,300 m2) brick and limestone building at 2250 Seymour Avenue in Bond Hill had an entrance that was decorated with six three-dimensional carved athletic figures. When it opened, its seating capacity of 11,000+ made it the seventh largest indoor arena in the United States.

The Cincinnati Gardens&#x27; first event was an exhibition hockey game. It has been the home of six league championship hockey teams, and most recently was the home of the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks of the American Hockey League. It also has been host to numerous other sporting events, concerts, stage shows, circuses, and political rallies. The Gardens&#x27; final tenants were the Cincinnati Rollergirls of the Women&#x27;s Flat Track Derby Association and the Cincinnati Thunder of the North American 3 Hockey League.

In 2013, the Robinson family, which had owned the Gardens since 1979, put the arena up for sale. The family-controlled company, Kenko Corporation, no longer considered the arena a core asset. On June 16, 2016, the Port of Greater Cincinnati Development Authority approved a contract to acquire the property for $1.75 million from the Robinson family, which intended to repurpose the site for future light manufacturing. Demolition took place in March 2018.

== Sporting events ==

Cincinnati Gardens was known primarily as a venue for ice hockey, basketball, and boxing.

=== Hockey ===
The Gardens&#x27; first event was an exhibition hockey game on February 22, 1949, between the Dallas Texans of the United States Hockey League and their parent National Hockey League team, the Montreal Canadiens. Several of the Texans&#x27; players would soon seed the first professional hockey team in Cincinnati, the Cincinnati Mohawks, who played at the Gardens from 1949 through 1958—three seasons in the AHL and six in the International Hockey League. Three NHL Hall of Famers played for the Mohawks—Harry Howell, Buddy O&#x27;Connor and Clint Smith—and from 1952 through 1957, the team won an IHL record five consecutive Turner Cup championships.

Cincinnati Gardens was also home to the Cincinnati Mohawks of the Midwest Amateur Hockey League in 1966, 1968, and 1969. Most of the Mohawks games were held in the annex, but some were played in the main building. The Xavier University Ice Hockey Program began using the Cincinnati Gardens as its home facility for the 2007–2008 season.

The Cincinnati Swords played in the AHL as an affiliate of the NHL Buffalo Sabres from 1971 through 1974 and won the Calder Cup as AHL champions in 1973.

The Cincinnati Wings played the 1963–64 season at the Gardens, relocating from Indianapolis (where they were known as the Capitals) after their home arena, the Indiana State Fairgrounds Coliseum, was heavily damaged in a propane explosion on October 31, 1963, that killed 74 people.

The Cincinnati Cyclones played in the East Coast Hockey League for two seasons and the IHL for five seasons at the Cincinnati Gardens. When the Cyclones moved to U.S. Bank Arena in 1997, the AHL returned to the building for the third time with the creation of the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks, an affiliate of the NHL Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and Detroit Red Wings, who played in the building until 2005.

The Cincinnati Thunder of the North American 3 Hockey League moved to the Gardens beginning with the 2015–16 season, making the team the Gardens&#x27; newest hockey tenant.

Though having no pro-hockey team for its last 11 years of operation, the Gardens still acted as the home rink for several area high school teams.

=== Basketball ===
The Gardens was home to the Cincinnati Royals of the National Basketball Association (now the Sacramento Kings) from 1957 through 1972. Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson played for the Royals from 1960 through 1970. The arena hosted the 1966 NBA All-Star Game, and Royals&#x27; guard Adrian Smith was named the game&#x27;s Most Valuable Player.

College basketball, including 42 &quot;Crosstown Shootout&quot; games between the University of Cincinnati and Xavier University, were played at the Gardens since its first week in 1949. The arena has served as the home court for both schools at various times, lastly for Xavier from 1983 until their move to the on-campus Cintas Center in 2000.

From 1984 through 1987, the Cincinnati Slammers of the Continental Basketball Association played their home games at the Gardens.

High school basketball also used the Gardens, both for regular season games—such as contests matching Middletown &amp; Hamilton Highs—as well as post-season tournaments including the state tourney in 1953 and 1955.

=== Boxing ===
The Gardens hosted a number of boxing matches, particularly several featuring prominent local and international fighters. Eventual Heavyweight champion and Hall of Famer Ezzard Charles of Cincinnati defeated Joey Maxim in a heavyweight title contender fight on February 28, 1949, in the arena&#x27;s first week. Cincinnatian Wallace &quot;Bud&quot; Smith defended his World Lightweight crown there on October 19, 1955. Numerous Golden Gloves competitions have drawn as many as 10,000+ fans, and a &quot;Super Brawl Sunday&quot; event was held in 2002.

On August 30, 2008, Relentless Events packed over 6000 fans into the arena for former heavyweight champion Lamon Brewster&#x27;s comeback fight against Danny Batchelder. Brewster won by fifth-round knockout. Local favorites Rashad Holloway and Aaron Pryor Jr. also won on the undercard.

=== Other sports ===
Other sports hosted at the Gardens have included:
* Indoor soccer – Cincinnati Silverbacks (1995–1997), Cincinnati Kings (2010–2012)
* Roller Derby – Cincinnati Rollergirls; Cincinnati Jolters (1971)

<text>Cedarville University is a private Baptist university in Cedarville, Ohio. It is chartered by the state of Ohio, approved by the Ohio Board of Regents, and accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

Established in 1887, the school was originally affiliated with the conservative Reformed Presbyterian Church in North America, General Synod, now known as the Presbyterian Church in America. In 1953, it became affiliated with the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches until 2006. Since 2003, Cedarville is affiliated with the State Convention of Baptists in Ohio (Southern Baptist Convention).

==History==
===1800s and 1900s===
Cedarville College was chartered in 1887 by the New Light Reformed Presbyterian Church; at the time, the surrounding township was largely Presbyterian. The first classes were held in 1892, though the college did not officially open until 1894. David McKinney was the college&#x27;s first president.

After McKinney, Wilbert McChesney served as president from 1915 to 1940. McChesney guided the college during World War I and the Depression, and also served as professor of New Testament when the Reformed Presbyterian Seminary was located at Cedarville. In addition to his duties at Cedarville, McChesney served seven terms in the Ohio Legislature.

Walter Smith Kilpatrick replaced McChesney in 1940 and served until 1943. He is the only alumnus of the college (1934) to serve as president, having graduated with honors. Kilpatrick&#x27;s brief tenure faced financial challenges and the impact of World War II.

Ira Vayhinger became the college&#x27;s fourth president in 1943 and served until 1950. He had served as general secretary of the local YMCA from 1911 to 1922. He joined Cedarville College in 1941 as finance director and business manager. As president, he guided the college through enrollment challenges and the difficult years of World War II.

E. H. Miller was appointed president in 1950. During his tenure, in 1953, the college merged with the Baptist Bible Institute of Cleveland. Following the unanimous vote of both boards of trustees, the transfer of property occurred April 4, 1953. Miller&#x27;s tenure as president ended in 1953.

Leonard Webster, the dean of the Baptist Bible Institute of Cleveland, became president of Cedarville College in 1953. In 1953, the Baptist Bible Institute of Cleveland, Ohio, relocated to Cedarville&#x27;s campus and transitioned into management of Cedarville College through a merger arrangement with the college&#x27;s Presbyterian board of trustees, who each resigned in turn. The Baptists were affiliated with the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches. Webster led the move from Cleveland to Cedarville and hired new faculty to complement the existing Baptist Bible Institute professors. Webster represented Cedarville at national and state conferences of the Regular Baptist Churches to promote the college.

James T. Jeremiah, Cedarville College&#x27;s seventh president, began his tenure in 1954 and served until 1978. Under Jeremiah&#x27;s leadership, Cedarville College transformed to an accredited institution of higher learning. College enrollment increased to over 1,200 during Jeremiah&#x27;s tenure by the mid-1970s. The Jeremiah Chapel in the Dixon Ministry Center is named in honor of Jeremiah. David Jeremiah, his son, is a noted alumnus and a former Cedarville trustee.

Paul H. Dixon became the eighth president of Cedarville College in 1978. During the 25 years that Dixon served as president, Cedarville constructed $100 million in facilities and expanded from 180 to 400 acres.

===2000s===
In 2002, it became a university. In 2003, it became affiliated with the State Convention of Baptists in Ohio. Enrollment increased from 1,185 students in 1978 to more than 3,000 by the end of Dixon&#x27;s service in 2003.

Cedarville&#x27;s ninth president, William E. Brown, took office in 2003. Under his leadership, the university developed new online programs and launched the Pharm.D., M.S.N., M.B.A., and now-defunct M.Ed. programs. The campus expanded to include the Center for Biblical and Theological Studies and Health Sciences Center and renovated 14 residence halls. Yet, mid-way through his tenure, President Brown experienced controversies regarding the lack of collegiality among Bible professors and the allegiance to the school&#x27;s doctrinal statement, leading to the terminations of some professors, most notably, David Hoffeditz and Michael Pahl. As a result of ongoing problems, President Brown announced his resignation in October 2012. In January 2013, &quot;Inside Higher Ed&quot; characterized the university as being in the midst of an &quot;ongoing, tangled doctrinal controversy.&quot; Vice President for Student Life Carl Ruby resigned for undisclosed reasons in January 2013. Due to lack of interest, the board of trustees eliminated Cedarville&#x27;s philosophy major at the end of the academic year.

In 2006, the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches terminated its relationship with the school due to the partnership with the Southern Baptist Convention and perceived liberalism in this convention.

Brown left his position as president in July 2013, instead becoming the university&#x27;s chancellor, an office he held until July 2014. Thomas White became the 10th president of Cedarville in July 2013. Under White&#x27;s leadership, the university completed an extensive renovation of the Jeremiah Chapel, built new science laboratories, established two additional graduate programs, and founded the Center for Biblical Apologetics and Public Christianity.

In December 2013, following policy changes made by President White, twenty-year associate professor of Christian education Joy Fagan resigned, saying she felt that she was no longer a good fit for the university. White claimed that his policies were in line with Cedarville&#x27;s past values and Scripture, and were &quot;not a new shift.&quot; In early 2014, White said that university was preparing to codify their complementarian stance concerning gender roles and re-wrote the school&#x27;s doctrinal statement to reflect the change. According to &quot;100: Cedarville College, A Century of Commitment&quot; by J. Murray Murdoch, the first doctrinal statement adopted by then-Cedarville College made no mention of gender roles or complementarian theology.

From 2010 to 2014, an independent student newspaper titled &quot;The Ventriloquist&quot; was written by students and publicly distributed on campus without authorization. The publication often reported alternative perspectives about the institutional changes and had published LGBT-sympathetic content. In April 2014, President White and Vice President of Student Life Jon Wood confiscated copies of the newspaper as students waited outside the chapel to distribute it. According to &quot;The Ventriloquist&quot;, White stated that permission was required to distribute the newspaper. After this incident, &quot;The Ventriloquist&quot; was moved online, where new articles continued to be published for about a year.

In the spring of 2017, White and then-Academic Vice President Loren Reno instituted what they called the &quot;Philippians 4:8 Policy&quot;, which they claimed provided biblically consistent guidelines for faculty to follow but which some professors claimed amounted to censorship and the loss of academic freedom. They later changed the policy title to the &quot;Biblically Consistent Curriculum (BCC) Policy,&quot; after two veteran Bible professors objected to this interpretation and application of Philippians 4:8. The policy is still in place today, serving to regulate the literature, art, films, and other media that faculty are permitted to use in the classroom.

The university&#x27;s seal has remained essentially unchanged from the Presbyterians&#x27; original design and still contains the Latin phrase &quot;Pro Corona et Foedere Christi&quot;, which is translated, &quot;For the crown and covenant of Christ&quot;. The original seal is surrounded with a slogan adopted by the former Baptist Bible Institute, &quot;For the Word of God and the Testimony of Jesus Christ&quot;.

=== Controversies under President White ===
Thomas White took office as president in July 2013, becoming the 10th president of Cedarville University. Under White&#x27;s leadership, the university has completed an extensive renovation of the Jeremiah Chapel, built new science laboratories, established two additional graduate programs, and founded the Center for Biblical Apologetics and Public Christianity. President White has also been embroiled in controversies. In December 2013, twenty-year Cedarville professor Joy Fagan resigned, saying she did not fit the changing policies, including the new restriction of only female students allowed in the Bible classes taught by female professors. White claimed that his policies were in line with past values and Scripture, and were &quot;not a new shift&quot;, although many alumni remember Ms. Jean Fisher, associate professor of Christian education, who taught male and female students in the department under President Dixon. In early 2014, White said that university was preparing to codify their complementarian stance concerning gender roles and re-wrote the school&#x27;s doctrinal statement to reflect that change. Although egalitarian faculty existed, some felt they were no longer welcome. According to &quot;100: Cedarville College, A Century of Commitment&quot; by J. Murray Murdoch, Ph.D., the first doctrinal statement adopted by then-Cedarville College made no mention of gender roles or complementarian theology. White also said he was eliminating layers of leadership so that the presidential cabinet would have direct authority over the university.

In April 2014, President White and Vice President of Student Life Jon Wood took copies of &quot;The Ventriloquist&quot;, an independent student newspaper, during its unauthorized public distribution; the publication had previously reported alternative perspectives about the institutional changes and published LGBT-sympathetic content. Per the &quot;Ventriloquist&quot; website, the paper recognized that they were outside the university life and chose to publish online. Similarly, in the spring of 2017, immediately after the university earned reaccreditation from the Higher Learning Commission, White and then-Academic Vice President Loren Reno instituted what they called the &quot;Philippians 4:8 Policy&quot;, which they claimed provided biblically consistent guidelines for faculty to follow but which some professors claimed amounted to censorship and the loss of academic freedom. They later changed the policy title to the &quot;Biblically Consistent Curriculum (BCC) Policy,&quot; after two veteran Bible professors objected to this interpretation and application of Philippians 4:8. The policy still exists today and tightly regulates the literature, art, films, media, etc. faculty are permitted to use in the classroom.

Cedarville has also made national news for its handling of alleged sexual assaults. In 2013, the U.S. Department of Education&#x27;s Office for Civil Rights opened an investigation into how allegations of sexual assaults are handled on campus. In 2018, the chair of the university&#x27;s board of trustees and White&#x27;s mentor, Paige Patterson, was fired from his position at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (SWBTS) for covering up a sexual assault; he subsequently resigned from the board. In July 2020, &quot;The Roys Report&quot; alleged that Thomas White and his wife, Joy White, aided in this cover-up during their time at the SWBTS.

In recent years, students have also alleged that faculty and staff have failed to provide a safe environment for students, discouraged them from seeking help while experiencing suicidal ideation, and threatened retaliatory lawsuits against students for submitting Title IX complaints.

On May 1, 2020, Cedarville&#x27;s board of trustees placed President White on administrative leave. The board stated that it had learned additional details regarding White&#x27;s hiring and subsequent firing of an admitted sexual abuser. Lieutenant General (Ret.) Loren Reno was appointed acting president. While White claimed he did not know the extent of Anthony Moore&#x27;s predation, the Village Church of Fort Worth claims to have provided him with a complete testimony at the time of Moore&#x27;s hiring. In June, the board reinstated White, leading to the resignation of Mark Vreogop and Danny Akin.

Citing these controversies and high staff turnover, the Higher Learning Commission is conducting an assurance review into Cedarville University&#x27;s accreditation status in 2020.

==National recognition==
The Wall Street Journal recognized Cedarville as one of the top three evangelical Christian universities in the United States.

==Academics==

Cedarville University offers more than 150 programs of study, which cover most areas of the liberal arts, the sciences, professional programs, and theological studies. It also offers over 50 minors, including a five-class Bible minor, which all students are required to take. The university awards graduate degrees in the areas of nursing (M.S.N.), business (M.B.A.), ministry (M.Min. and M.Div.) and pharmacy (Pharm.D.). Cedarville is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

The university launched a School of Pharmacy in 2009 with 52 students beginning a three-year pre-pharmacy curriculum, and the four-year professional graduate program (Doctor of Pharmacy) launched in 2012. The program is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education. The Doctor of Pharmacy degree is the university&#x27;s only doctoral degree and provides patient care services and student education through Cedar Care Pharmacy and the Center for Pharmacy Innovation.

In 2022, Cedarville changed the name of the School of Business Administration, to the Robert W. Plaster School of Business (PSB). As a consequence of a donation from the Robert Plaster Foundation and other donations from individuals, the newly branded PSB is housed in the business building next to the Stevens Student Center.

In 2024, the first cohort of physician assistant students commenced their clinical rotations, marking a significant step in the university&#x27;s commitment to healthcare education.

The university website reported record-breaking enrollment in 2024 of 6,384 students, including 1,176 freshmen, 590 graduate students, and 1,770 dual-enrolled students.

The university employs more than 200 faculty in several academic departments and the schools of engineering, education, business, pharmacy, nursing, and biblical and theological studies. Academic faculty are required to commit to &quot;biblical integration in and out of the classroom&quot; and must be born-again Christians.

==Spiritual life==

According to its mission statement, the university is &quot;a Christ-centered learning community equipping students for lifelong leadership and service through an education marked by excellence and grounded in biblical truth.&quot; All students are required to earn a 15 credit hour Bible minor and attend weekday chapel services on-campus in the Dixon Ministry Center. Students are also encouraged to participate in various community service and ministry programs off campus.

Discipleship groups (D-groups) also feature a prominent role on campus. The purpose of d-groups is to facilitate a more accountable form of small-group ministry. A discipleship group of the same gender meets once a week to go through a book of the Bible or Christian book. After a year of being in a d-group, individuals can apply to be a d-group leader.

==Campus==

The university&#x27;s original campus and facilities are located in the village of Cedarville. Since about 1970, the school has purchased and consolidated surrounding farmlands which now total approximately 400 acres to the north and west of the village. Among the few turn-of-the-century structures is Founders Hall (Old Main), which houses the president&#x27;s office and administrative functions.

Students are strongly encouraged to live on-campus, and about 80% do so. Those who choose to reside on campus live in single-sex residence halls. The university has eleven residence buildings for men and eleven for women, all with co-ed lounges. Some halls group rooms in a suite-like setting, with three to four bedrooms sharing a small lounge in each unit, while others have a single-room, hall-style format with communal lounges on each floor. Townhouses are available for upper class and graduate students.

Newer athletic facilities cover the farthest northwestern reaches of campus, including a soccer stadium and baseball/softball fields. The university created the Elvin R. King Cross Country Course in 2006, located on the north end of campus and designed to host NCAA-sanctioned, as well as All-Ohio and National Christian College Athletic Association meets.

=== Water tower===

The water tower of Cedarville University is a landmark on the university campus in Cedarville, Ohio. First erected in 1983, the water tower underwent a $55,000 renovation in 2015. The water tower is located behind Cedarville&#x27;s athletic center and bears the school&#x27;s mascot, a yellow jacket named Stinger, along with the university&#x27;s stylized text logo. The aesthetic elements were added in the 2015 renovation by H2O Towers of Saline, Michigan. The job was completed in four days using high-gloss paint manufactured by Tnemec. The water tower can be seen over Cedarville University by southbound drivers on Ohio 72. The tower serves as a landmark for one of the university&#x27;s emergency telephones.

== Controversies ==
Cedarville has been criticized at a national level for its handling of alleged sexual assaults. In 2013, a student filed an anonymous federal complaint against the university for allegedly violating Title IX and mishandling her report of attempted rape. Following this complaint, the U.S. Department of Education&#x27;s Office for Civil Rights opened an investigation into how Cedarville handled allegations of sexual assaults. In 2018, the chair of the university&#x27;s board of trustees and White&#x27;s mentor, Paige Patterson, was fired from his position at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (SWBTS) for covering up a sexual assault there; he subsequently resigned from the board. &quot;The Roys Report&quot; alleged that Thomas White and his wife, Joy, aided in this cover-up during their time at the SWBTS, although White responded that he had never met the victim, and neither he nor his wife had heard of the rape.

Students have also alleged through &quot;The Roys Report&quot; that faculty and staff have failed to provide a safe environment for students, discouraged them from seeking help while experiencing suicidal ideation, and threatened retaliatory lawsuits against students for submitting Title IX complaints.
On May 1, 2020, Cedarville&#x27;s board of trustees placed President White on administrative leave, stating that it had learned additional details regarding White&#x27;s hiring and subsequent firing of Anthony Moore, an admitted sexual abuser. Lieutenant General (Ret.) Loren Reno was appointed acting president. While White claimed he did not know the extent of Moore&#x27;s abuse, the Village Church of Fort Worth claimed to have provided him with a complete testimony at the time of Moore&#x27;s hiring. In June 2020, the board reinstated White, leading to the resignation of two board members, Mark Vroegop and Danny Akin.

<text>José María Velasco Ibarra (19 March 1893 – 30 March 1979) was an Ecuadorian politician. He became president of Ecuador five times, in 1934–1935, 1944–1947, 1952–1956, 1960–1961, and 1968–1972, and only in 1952–1956 he completed a full term. In his four other terms, he was removed by military force, and several times he was installed as president through a military coup.

==Early life and career==

Velasco Ibarra was born on 19 March 1893 in Quito. His parents were Delia Ibarra and Alejandrino Velasco, a civil engineer. His father was a political activist in the conservative party during the dictatorship installed by the liberal revolution. He was home schooled by his mother. His father died when he was 16. He attended high school at Colegio San Gabriel and obtained a JD (Doctorate in Jurisprudence) from the Central University of Ecuador. As an author he published several books, including &quot;Conciencia y Barbarie&quot;, and was also a columnist for &quot;El Comercio&quot;.

His first public post was in Quito&#x27;s Municipal Government, where he supervised works and visited communities. His political career began when he was named a Deputy of the Republic. In 1932, he was elected as Vice President of the Chamber of Deputies and several days later, President of the Chamber of Deputies.

==Presidencies==
In 1933, he stood in the Ecuadorian presidential election and received 80% of the votes cast, the highest in Ecuadorian history. Velasco Ibarra traveled through several Latin American countries, including Peru, and restored Ecuador&#x27;s global image. His first presidency began on 1 September 1934, but he was ousted in August 1935 by the military. He went into exile in Colombia, where he worked in the Santander School in Sevilla, which was named the best school in Colombia. Later, he traveled to Buenos Aires, where he worked as a university professor.

He stood again in the 1940 election and was defeated by the Radical Liberal Party candidate Carlos Arroyo del Río by a small margin. Arroyo del Río lacked Velasco Ibarra&#x27;s popularity and public support, which indicated that there had been a fraud. Velasco Ibarra plotted a coup d&#x27;état with pilots from the Salinas Air Force base. Before executing his plan, he was detained and exiled again.

1944 was an especially acute crisis, following the defeat of Ecuador in a war with Peru. There was a bitter rivalry between the conservative regular army and the more radical national police (the &#x27;carabineros&#x27;). High inflation had soured the people. Velasco Ibarra built his coalition using the rhetoric of moral reform, calling for the virtuous common people to rise against the corrupt and selfish oligarchy. Velasco presented himself as the embodiment of positive moral qualities, appealing to both Left and Right without presenting any precise political program. Thanks to the &quot;Glorious Revolution&quot; of May 28, he was named Supreme Chief of the Republic and was later named Constitutional President by the Constituent Assembly. In August 1947, he was again deposed by the military. Three defense ministers perpetrated the coup against Velasco Ibarra; among them was minister Mancheno, who later was his successor.

In 1952, he again won the presidential election, and began his third term as president on September 1, 1952. This time, he served his entire term, which ended on August 31, 1956. His third term was a time of progress for Ecuador: 311 schools were constructed, with another 104 in progress. More than 1359 km of roads were constructed, and 1057 km more were improved.
Velasco Ibarra was a noted orator: in his political campaigns from town to town, he captivated people with eloquence, becoming a leader of the masses. Velasco Ibarra once said, &quot;Give me a balcony and I will become president.&quot;

In 1960, he was elected president for the fourth time and was removed on November 7, 1961. In 1960, he nullified the Rio de Janeiro Protocol, which led to conflicts between Ecuador and Peru, including Paquisha in 1981 and the War of El Cenepa in 1995.

Finally, in 1968, Velasco Ibarra won the presidency for a fifth time. This government ended abruptly on February 15, 1972, when once more he was deposed in a bloodless coup, which brought General Guillermo Rodríguez Lara to power. In total, Velasco Ibarra governed nearly 13 years, making him the longest-serving president in Ecuadorian history (although Rafael Correa&#x27;s decade-long presidency from 2007 until 2017 is the longest continuous presidency). The events surrounding the end of his fifth and last presidency are dealt with in Philip Agee&#x27;s book &quot;Inside the Company: A CIA Diary&quot;.

Velasco was a fiery populist who did not have a formal party organization. Rather it was his populist rhetoric that attracted enthusiastic followers, as he presented himself as the advocate of the poor and downtrodden. In office he was not responsible for major reforms, but he used patronage effectively to maintain his largely inefficient and corrupt administrations.

There is debate about whether his rule can correctly be labelled as populist. Following Agustin Cueva, several authors have argued that in the midst of a hegemonic crisis Velasco rose to power on the votes of the coastal sub-proletariat, peasants who had migrated to urban centres as the cacao industry dwindled. The charismatic figure of Velasco, according to this view, emotionally captured the masses with promises of redemption. Others, among them Rafael Quintero, argue that the entrenched landowning elite was instrumental for Velasco&#x27;s victory (at least in the 1930s), as the Coastal elite had been weakened by the end of the cacao boom.

==Works==
Velasco Ibarra always had a special preoccupation with infrastructure. Many public works, including roads, hospitals, and bridges, were constructed during Velasco Ibarra&#x27;s presidencies. He was the initiator of institutions such as the Supreme Electoral Tribunalián and Guamote. He decreed the law of weekly days off for workers, ordered the construction of irrigation canals, educational infrastructure, aircraft fields, and highways.

==Death==
Velasco Ibarra&#x27;s wife, Corina Parral de Velasco Ibarra died in Buenos Aires after falling from a bus. This precipitated the death of Velasco Ibarra, who said on his return to Ecuador, &quot;I come to meditate and to die.&quot; He died in Quito, on 30 March 1979.

<text>In computing, codice_1 is a command that outputs the strings that are passed to it as arguments. It is a command available in various operating system shells and typically used in shell scripts and batch files to output status text to the screen or a computer file, or as a source part of a pipeline.

==Implementations==
The command is available in the following operating systems:
* Multics
* TSC FLEX
* MetaComCo TRIPOS
* Zilog Z80-RIO
* Microware OS-9
* DOS
* Acorn Computers Panos
* Digital Research FlexOS
* IBM OS/2
* Microsoft Windows
* ReactOS
* HP MPE/iX
* KolibriOS
* SymbOS
* Unix and Unix-like operating systems

Many shells, including all Bourne-like (such as Bash or zsh) and Csh-like shells as well as COMMAND.COM and cmd.exe implement codice_1 as a builtin command.

The command is also available in the EFI shell.

==History==
codice_1 began within Multics. After it was programmed in C by Doug McIlroy as a &quot;finger exercise&quot; and proved to be useful, it became part of Version 2 Unix. codice_4 in Version 7 replaced codice_5, (which behaved like codice_1 but without terminating its output with a line delimiter).

On PWB/UNIX and later Unix System III, codice_1 started expanding C escape sequences such as codice_8 with the notable difference that octal escape sequences were expressed as codice_9 instead of codice_10 in C.

Eighth Edition Unix codice_1 only did the escape expansion when passed a codice_12 option, and that behaviour was copied by a few other implementations such as the builtin codice_1 command of Bash or zsh and GNU codice_1.

On MS-DOS, the command is available in versions 2 and later.

Nowadays, several incompatible implementations of codice_1 exist on different operating systems (often several on the same system), some of them expanding escape sequences by default, some of them not, some of them accepting options (the list of which varying with implementations), some of them not.

The POSIX specification of codice_1 leaves the behaviour unspecified if the first argument is codice_17 or any argument contain backslash characters while the Unix specification (XSI option in POSIX) mandates the expansion of (some) sequences and does not allow any option processing. In practice, many codice_1 implementations are not compliant in the default environment.

Because of these variations in behaviour, codice_1 is considered a non-portable command on Unix-like systems and the codice_20 command (where available, introduced by Ninth Edition Unix) is preferred instead.

==Usage examples==

C:\&gt;echo Hello world
Hello world
Using ANSI escape code &quot;SGR&quot; sequences, compatible terminals can print out colored text.

Using a UNIX System III-style implementation:
BGRED=`echo &quot;\033[41m&quot;`
FGBLUE=`echo &quot;\033[35m&quot;`
BGGREEN=`echo &quot;\033[42m&quot;`

NORMAL=`echo &quot;\033[m&quot;`
Or a Unix Version 8-style implementation (such as Bash when not in Unix-conformance mode):
BGRED=`echo -e &quot;\033[41m&quot;`
FGBLUE=`echo -e &quot;\033[35m&quot;`
BGGREEN=`echo -e &quot;\033[42m&quot;`

NORMAL=`echo -e &quot;\033[m&quot;`
and after:
echo &quot;${FGBLUE} Text in blue ${NORMAL}&quot;
echo &quot;Text normal&quot;
echo &quot;${BGRED} Background in red&quot;
echo &quot;${BGGREEN} Background in Green and back to Normal ${NORMAL}&quot;
Portably with codice_20:
BGRED=`printf &#x27;\33[41m&#x27;`
NORMAL=`printf &#x27;\33[m&#x27;`
printf &#x27;%s\n&#x27; &quot;${BGRED}Text on red background${NORMAL}&quot;

<doc id="754165" wikidata="Q318437" url="?curid=754165" title="Bora Milutinović">
<text>Velibor &quot;Bora&quot; Milutinović (; born 7 September 1944) is a Serbian former professional footballer and manager. 

He has managed at five editions of the FIFA World Cup, tied for the record alongside Brazilian manager Carlos Alberto Parreira, but did so in five consecutive World Cups with different teams: Mexico (1986), Costa Rica (1990), the United States (1994), Nigeria (1998) and China (2002). He is also the first manager to take four teams beyond the first round – all but China – earning the nickname of &quot;Miracle Worker&quot;, first given to him by Alan Rothenberg, then president of the United States Soccer Federation. In total, Milutinović has managed eight national football teams.

==Managing career==
===World Cup national teams===
====Mexico (1983–86)====

Milutinović led Mexico to the quarter-finals at the 1986 FIFA World Cup, its highest finish. Mexico fell in the quarter-finals to West Germany on penalty kicks.

====Costa Rica (1990)====

Milutinović took over Costa Rica just before the 1990 FIFA World Cup and got Costa Rica into the second round. In 1990, Milutinović was hired as head coach of Costa Rica just 90 days before the World Cup. He cut the captain and other starters. Costa Rica managed to beat Scotland and Sweden and lost to Brazil, 1–0, before losing 4–1 to Czechoslovakia in the second round.

====United States (1991–95)====

Hank Steinbrecher, general secretary of the U.S. Soccer Federation, conducted the job interviews for the U.S. national team head coach position. American coaches had not proved their worth on the international stage, as the United States had lost all three games in the 1990 World Cup finals under Bob Gansler. When the USSF&#x27;s search began in 1991, the emphasis was not so much on experience, but on finding a coach who could squeeze the last drop of potential out of a lightly regarded team, and Milutinović&#x27;s name came up again and again. He had coached first Mexico, then Costa Rica to surprising World Cup success.

Milutinović left no doubts about who ran the team, cutting two U.S. players, Peter Vermes and Desmond Armstrong, board members of the national federation, from his World Cup team. Milutinović further cut Bruce Murray, the all-time leading U.S. goal scorer. When Alexi Lalas first showed up at training camp, Milutinović told him to get a haircut or get off the team.

Milutinović coached the U.S. national team at the 1994 FIFA World Cup, hosted in the United States, where the team notched its first win in the World Cup since 1950 and progressed to the knockout round of the tournament for the first time since the 1930s. This was hailed as a success for a country with little soccer experience. Bora’s name was used for the 1994 World Cup set manufactured by the Upper Deck Company.

The USSF fired Milutinović on 14 April 1995, saying it wanted someone who could be both coach and administrator. Milutinović reportedly wanted no part of the administrative duties.

====Nigeria (1997–98)====

Milutinović coached the Nigerian team at the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. Nigeria won its group, notching a notable 3–2 upset win over Spain, and reached the knockout rounds. This was the fourth team that Milutinović had taken to the knockout rounds of the World Cup, a coaching record.

====China (2000–02)====

Under Milutinović&#x27;s coaching, for the first time ever, the China national team qualified to be among the 32 finalists for the World Cup in 2002. He was hailed as a hero in China, ending a 44-year drought, and was popularly known as &quot;Milu&quot;. However, unlike his previous forays, Milutinović could not take the Chinese team past the first round due to their inexperience at the world stage.

===Other national teams===

====Honduras (2003–04)====

In the summer of 2003, Milutinović was in serious negotiations to finally take over the national team at his native Serbia. Despite heavy, month-long persuasion from Serbian football officials, Milutinović turned down the offer and soon signed on to the Honduras national team. He led the team to the first round of CONCACAF qualifiers before resigning on 30 June 2004. He cited &quot;the prevailing bad atmosphere, created by comments made by the country&#x27;s managers, officials and press&quot; as the reason for his leaving during World Cup qualifying.

====Jamaica (2006–07)====

On 16 November 2006, Milutinović was announced as head coach of Jamaica. On 9 November 2007, following a string of six consecutive friendly defeats, he was fired by the Jamaican FA.

====Iraq (2009)====

Milutinović led the Iraq national football team in group play in the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup for two draws and one loss, failing to reach the knockout stage.

===Club teams===

Milutinović&#x27;s managerial career at club level has seen more mixed success. His longest managerial spell for a single club was his tenure with UNAM of Mexico from 1977 to 1983. Several of his Pumas players ended up playing for Mexico at the 1986 World Cup.

Since then, he has managed briefly for several club teams. He managed Udinese of the Italian Serie B for nine matches in 1987. He then managed the MetroStars of Major League Soccer to the worst record in league history in 1999. He also had a brief stint in the Qatar Stars League with Al-Sadd in the 2004–05 season.

===Managerial statistics===


==Personal life==

Milutinović comes from a footballing family; he and his two brothers Miloš and Milorad played together for Partizan.

His father was killed in World War II, his mother by tuberculosis soon after the war. He said he does not remember either of his parents. He was raised by an aunt, and raised playing football.

Milutinović is married to a Mexican and currently resides in Qatar. Aside from his native Serbo-Croatian, he is fluent in English, Spanish, Italian and French.

<doc id="754166" wikidata="Q441788" url="?curid=754166" title="Paul A. Dever">
<text>Paul Andrew Dever (January 15, 1903April 11, 1958) was an American Democratic politician from Boston, Massachusetts. He served as the 58th Governor of Massachusetts and was its youngest-ever Attorney General.
Among his notable accomplishments was the construction of Boston’s circumferential highway Route 128, then called &quot;Dever’s Folley,&quot; which was later expanded to Interstate 95, one of the most used national highways.

==Early life==
Paul Dever was born in Boston, Massachusetts to two Irish immigrants, Joseph and Anna MacAlevy Dever. His father died when he was eight, and he took odd jobs as a youth to help the family make ends meet. He attended Boston public schools, including Boston Latin School. He attended Northeastern University for a time, but then transferred to Boston University, from whose law school he graduated with an LL.B. in 1926 with high honors. He was admitted to the bar, and joined the practice of Harvey Boutwell, a blind attorney whose need to have papers read aloud furthered Dever&#x27;s oratorical skills.

He served as the grand knight of the Mt. Pleasant Council of the Knights of Columbus. He was also the godfather to one of State Deputy Thomas J. Spring&#x27;s children. He appointed Spring to a judgeship in Roxbury District Court.

==Early political career==

Dever was long interested in politics, having observed his uncle John, a leading figure in Massachusetts Democratic Party politics. He served for some time as an aide to Senator David I. Walsh, one of the state&#x27;s most prominent Democratic politicians. Dever was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives for the 3rd Middlesex district in 1928, and served from 1929 to 1935 in a district representing Cambridge that had historically been Republican.

In 1934 Dever was elected Attorney General, and was at age 31 the youngest to hold that office. Among his claimed successes were a 95% conviction rate, and the closure of a significant number of lenders engaging in usurious lending practices. He also identified under- or mis-utilized trust funds, including one which was eventually used for construction of the Hatch Shell on Boston&#x27;s Charles River Esplanade. In 1940, he challenged the popular incumbent Governor Leverett Saltonstall for his seat, losing by a margin of 0.3%.

==World War II==
In 1942, Dever enlisted in the United States Navy for World War II. He was subsequently commissioned a lieutenant commander, and served in the North Atlantic, European and African Sectors until his discharge at the end of the war in 1945. Assignments included command of the Marine Corps contingent at Argentia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and the delivery of election ballots to military posts. After the war, he continued to serve in the military reserve, and was eventually promoted to commander.

==Governor of Massachusetts==

Dever lost the 1946 race for lieutenant governor, but two years later he defeated incumbent governor Robert F. Bradford in a Democratic landslide, which saw that party gain complete control of the state for the first time in the 20th century. He was the state&#x27;s 58th governor, and won election to a second term in 1950, defeating the Republican candidate, former Lieutenant Governor Arthur W. Coolidge.

During his tenure, Dever increased state aid to schools and issued an executive order to extend higher education benefits to Korean War veterans. Among his chief concerns were civil defense and resisting domestic communism. He supported legislation requiring school teachers to take loyalty oaths, and he advocated increasing old age and workers compensation insurance. He also introduced a graduated income tax, and introduced measures to improve the care and education of the state&#x27;s mentally handicapped.

A major statewide transportation infrastructure initiative, developed by Governor Bradford, was passed during his term. Under this plan, the state constructed Massachusetts Route 128, the Central Artery, and Storrow Drive. The first bond issue for this work was passed early in his term; it had previously been rejected by the Democratic legislature in Bradford&#x27;s tenure. This and other major spending initiatives greatly exceeded the amount raised by new tax levies, and marked the start of an extended period of deficit spending by the state. In Dever&#x27;s second term, transportation spending was further expanded, and he established the Massachusetts Turnpike Commission, which funded construction of the Massachusetts Turnpike through bonds paid off by tolls.

Another major initiative undertaken during Dever&#x27;s period in office was a significant expansion of the state&#x27;s facilities for the mentally handicapped, which had suffered for many years from overcrowding and understaffing. Among the facilities built was the Myles Standish State School for the Mentally Retarded in Taunton, which was renamed the Paul A. Dever State School in his honor after his death.

In 1952, Dever made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Dever was also the keynote speaker at the 1952 Democratic National Convention; his speech, one of the first such speeches to be televised, made the portly Dever look bad. Also that year, the Dever administration came under fire when the Massachusetts Federation of Taxpayers Associations found that pensions for members and former members of the state legislature had been increased. One of those eligible was former Mayor of Boston and Governor James Michael Curley, a convicted felon. Dever gave in to pressure groups, calling a special session of the legislature that repealed the bill.

Dever had built a strong political machine in Massachusetts, and was widely considered a potential candidate for the United States Senate in 1952, which was also sought by John F. Kennedy. After informing Kennedy that he was interested in running again for governor, the two established a joint campaign committee. Kennedy maintained a distance from Dever and his campaign, and was able to capture the Senate seat in the election, which was otherwise a major victory for Republicans. Republican Christian Herter defeated Dever in a narrow win, assisted by the long coattails of Presidential winner Dwight David Eisenhower, and discontent among the state&#x27;s ethnic Democrats for Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic presidential nominee. After Dever&#x27;s death, associates of his alleged that the publisher of the &quot;Boston Post&quot; pressured Dever to arrange a loan in exchange for the newspaper&#x27;s endorsement.

==Death and burial==
After leaving office Dever returned to practicing law. He attempted to remain active in politics, supporting Stevenson in the 1956 presidential race, even though most state party leaders did not believe Stevenson&#x27;s chances against Eisenhower were any better than they had been in 1952.

Dever was a lifelong bachelor, who lived for many years in Cambridge with his sister Marie. She served as his First Lady during his tenure as governor. He suffered from heart disease in his later years, and died of a heart attack on April 11, 1958. He was buried in St. Joseph Cemetery in the West Roxbury section of Boston.

<doc id="754183" wikidata="Q297950" url="?curid=754183" title="Ramaswamy Venkataraman">
<text>Ramaswamy Venkataraman (, 4 December 191027 January 2009), also known as R. Venkataraman, was an Indian lawyer, independence activist and politician who served as a union minister and as the president of India.
Venkataraman was born in Rajamadam village in Tanjore district, Madras Presidency. He studied law and practised in the Madras High Court and the Supreme Court of India. In his youth, he was an activist for the Indian independence movement, and he participated in the Quit India Movement. He was appointed as the member of the Constituent Assembly and the provisional cabinet. He was elected to the Lok Sabha four times and served as Union Finance Minister and Defence Minister. In 1984, he was elected as the vice president of India and in 1987, he became the president of India and served from 1987 to 1992. He also served as a state minister under K. Kamaraj and M. Bhaktavatsalam.

==Early life==
Venkataraman was born in a Tamil Brahmin family in Rajamadam village near Pattukottai, Tanjore district in Madras Presidency, British India. He had his school education in Govt Boys Higher Secondary School, Pattukottai and undergraduation in National College, Tiruchirappalli.

Educated locally and in the city of Madras (now Chennai), Venkataraman obtained his master&#x27;s degree in economics from Loyola College, Madras. He later qualified in Law from the Law College, Madras. Venkataraman was enrolled in the Madras High Court in 1935 and in the Supreme Court in 1951.

While practising law, Venkataraman was drawn into the movement for India&#x27;s freedom from Britain&#x27;s colonial subjugation. His active participation in the Indian National Congress&#x27;s celebrated resistance to the British Government, the Quit India Movement of 1942, resulted in his detention for two years under the Defence of India Rules. Venkataraman&#x27;s interest in the law continued during this period. In 1946, when the transfer of power from British to Indian hands was imminent, the Government of India included him in the panel of lawyers sent to Malaya and Singapore to defend Indian nationals charged with offences of collaboration during the Japanese occupation of those two places. In the years 1947 to 1950, Venkataraman served as Secretary of the Madras Provincial Bar Federation.

==Political career==
Law and trade activity led to Venkataraman&#x27;s increasing association with politics. He was a member of constituent assembly that drafted India&#x27;s constitution. In 1950, he was elected to free India&#x27;s Provisional Parliament (1950–1952) and to the First Parliament (1952–1957). During his term of legislative activity, Venkataraman attended the 1952 Session of the Metal Trades Committee of International Labour Organisation as a workers&#x27; delegate. He was a member of the Indian Parliamentary Delegation to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference in New Zealand. Venkataraman was also Secretary to the Congress Parliamentary Party in 1953–1954.

Venkatraman was reelected to Parliament from Thanjavur in the general election of 1957 with an improved majority of 37,000 votes. He however resigned the seat and joined the Madras government at the invitation of its Chief Minister, K. Kamaraj. Venkataraman was sworn in as Minister for Industries on 26 April 1957 and was allotted several ministries including those of Labour and Co-operation, Commercial Taxes and Nationalised Transport, Textiles, Mines and Minerals and Companies and was elected to the Madras Legislative Council in the biennial elections conducted in March 1958.

In the assembly election of 1962, the Congress Party under K Kamaraj was returned to power. Venkataraman was retained as minister in charge of the same ministries during the Kamaraj Ministry which lasted 2 October 1963 and under Chief Minister M. Bhaktavatsalam who succeeded Kamaraj. Venkataraman himself was sworn-in as Minister in the Bhaktavatsalam Ministry only on 23 October 1963, as he was in New York to attend the session of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal. Venkataraman was reelected to the Council in the biennial elections of March 1964 and remained the leader of the house in the Council until after the assembly elections of 1967.

As Minister of Industries, Venkataraman proved to be an able administrator who ushered in a period of industrial development in Madras. He championed the idea of industrial estates, the first of which was established at Guindy, and succeeded in getting investments in major public sector undertakings such as the Integral Coach Factory, Neyveli Lignite Corporation and the Heavy Vehicles Factory. Venkataraman persuaded the TVS Group to set up a factory at Padi and several other private companies including Ashok Leyland, Hindustan Motors and Enfield established their automobile factories in Madras during this time. Tamil Nadu’s industrialization has been widely credited to steps initiated during Venkataraman’s decade as the state’s industries minister and he has been described as the “father of industrialization” in Tamil Nadu.

In 1967, Venkataraman contested the parliamentary election from Thanjavur but lost to the D.S. Gopalar of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. In the assembly election of 1967, the Congress was routed by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. C. N. Annadurai, the DMK’s leader in the Council became Chief Minister and Venkataraman the leader of the opposition in the Council until his resignation from the Council in August 1967.

Venkataraman was appointed a member of the Planning Commission in July, 1967 by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and held charge of industry, labour, power, transport, communications and railways. In 1970, the Commission on Major Ports headed by Venkataraman submitted its report to the Government. This was the first study to be made of the integrated function and development of major ports in India. He resigned from the Planning Commission in 1971.

In 1977, Venkataraman was elected to the Lok Sabha from Madras (South) Constituency and served as an Opposition Member of Parliament and Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee.

Venkataraman was also, variously, a member of the Political Affairs Committee and the Economic Affairs Committee of the Union Cabinet; Governor, International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Asian Development Bank. Venkataraman was a Delegate to the United Nations General Assembly in 1953, 1955, 1956, 1958, 1959, 1960 and 1961. He was Leader of the Indian Delegation to the 42nd Session of the International Labour Conference at Geneva (1958) and represented India in the Inter Parliamentary Conference in Vienna (1978). He was a member of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal from 1955 to 1979 and was its President from 1968 to 1979.

== Union Minister ==
=== Minister of Finance ===
Venkataraman was re-elected to the Lok Sabha from the Madras South constituency in the 1980 general election with an improved majority of over 120,000 votes. He was sworn in as Cabinet Minister in charge of Finance in the Indira Gandhi ministry on 14 January 1980. During January to April, 1980 he was also Minister of Industry. As finance minister, Venkataraman presented the interim and final budgets for 1980 and the budget in 1981. Venkataraman’s budget in 1981 was seen as favouring the middle class and industry, focusing on improving growth and savings in the economy while raising customs duty on all imported goods to raise revenue. In the same year, he introduced a bill for the establishment of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development which was passed by Parliament.

When allegations of corruption were raised against the Congress Party and the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, A. R. Antulay regarding the collection of funds by a trust named after Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, she tasked Venkataraman with defending the government in debates on the matter in Parliament. Although members of the opposition attempted to introduce privilege motions against Venkatraman on the grounds that he had misled parliament, these were rejected by the presiding officers in both houses of parliament. In his interventions, Venkataraman sought to dissociate the Prime Minister from the activities of Antulay and he rejected the opposition’s demand for a probe arguing that no improprieties had been committed by the trust to warrant an inquiry.

It was during Venkataraman’s tenure as finance minister that India negotiated with the International Monetary Fund for a loan for 5 billion special drawing rights amounting to US$5.68 billion. Sanctioned in November 1981, this was the largest loan ever made by the IMF. While the loan required the Indian government to limit the expansion of credit and curtail commercial borrowings and to consult the IMF on fiscal and monetary policies of the government, it did not require India to devalue the rupee as was done in the past.

=== Minister of Defence ===
Venkataraman was shifted from the Ministry of Finance on 15 January 1982 to the Ministry of Defence, a portfolio that had until then been held by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.

During Venkataraman’s tenure in the ministry, the Government of India signed deals to purchase Sea King helicopters and Sea Eagle missiles from the United Kingdom and Mirage fighter aircraft and Type 209 submarines from other western nations thus seeking to undo the near monopoly that the Soviet Union had on weapons systems in the Indian armed forces. In response, the Soviets, keen to not lose out in their largest arms market in the developing world, agreed to India’s request for acquiring the MiG-29 fighter jet and to the licensed production in India of the MiG-27 and MiG-29 aircraft during Venkataraman&#x27;s visit to Moscow in June 1983. The offer was finalized during the visit to India of the Soviet Defence Minister, Dmitry Ustinov in March 1984.

His most consequential contribution as Defence Minister, however, was the launch of the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme in 1983 which led to the indigenous development of the Prithvi, Akash, Agni, Thrishul and Nag missile systems by India&#x27;s Defence Research and Development Organisation. Venkataraman’s term also witnessed India attempt to conduct a nuclear test in 1983 and the seizing of the Siachen Glacier by the Indian Army in 1984.

Venkataraman demitted office on 2 August 1984 and was succeeded by S. B. Chavan as Minister of Defence.

== Vice President of India ==
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi chose Venkataraman to be the Congress Party’s candidate for the vice presidential election to elect a successor to M. Hidayatullah. Bapu Chandrasen Kamble of the Republican Party of India was his sole opponent. In the election held on 22 August 1984, Venkataraman won 508 of 715 valid votes cast to win outright. Venkataraman was sworn in as Vice-President on 31 August 1984.

Following Indira Gandhi’s assassination, Vice President Venkataraman went along with President Zail Singh’s decision to appoint Rajiv Gandhi as prime minister. It was Venkataraman who announced Indira Gandhi’s death on Doordarshan and the swearing-in of a new government under Rajiv Gandhi.

As relations between Rajiv Gandhi and President Zail Singh worsened, the Prime Minister stopped calling on the President. The government also began to depute Venkataraman in place of Singh on diplomatic visits. Gandhi however told Parliament that he had been meeting the president regularly and had kept him informed on all matters of policy. A letter contradicting the Prime Minister’s statement, allegedly written by President Singh, was leaked to the media which led to a political furore. Venkataraman saved Rajiv Gandhi’s government much embarrassment when he declined to allow a discussion in the house on this letter and on the president&#x27;s right to be kept informed under Article 78 of the Constitution. Despite angry protests and walkouts by opposition parties, Venkataraman refused to budge stating that confidentiality of communications between the president and the prime minister was required to be maintained in the interest of the nation.

As President Singh’s term neared its end it was widely speculated that he intended to dismiss Gandhi as prime minister and appoint a caretaker government. Singh asked Venkataraman whether he would be interested in becoming the prime minister in such an eventuality but Venkataraman declined the offer.

In the run up to the presidential election of 1987, the Congress party’s initial choices for president were B. Shankaranand, Pupul Jayakar and P.V. Narasimha Rao. However, Venkataraman let it be known that he would resign if he were not nominated as the party’s candidate for the presidency. On 14 June 1987 the Congress Parliamentary Board endorsed Venkataraman as the party’s nominee for the presidential election. The Left parties fielded Justice V. R. Krishna Iyer as their candidate and despite speculation that he might contest as an independent candidate, President Singh chose to retire.

== President of India ==

In the election held in July 1987 Venkataraman emerged victorious winning 740,148 votes against 281,550 votes polled by Krishna Iyer. Mithilesh Kumar came a distant third winning 2,223 votes. Venkatraman won the support of 606 of 755 Members of Parliament and majorities in 14 of 25 state legislative assemblies while Iyer won a majority in 8 legislative assemblies where non-Congress parties held a majority and the support of 139 members of Parliament. Kumar, leader of the Goodmans Party, ended up winning seven votes. Venkataraman was declared elected on 16 July 1987 and was sworn in on 25 July 1987. The election was challenged unsuccessfully in the Supreme Court by Mithilesh Kumar. Coming after a series of electoral defeats, controversies over defence deals and the uneasy relationship between Prime Minister Gandhi and President Zail Singh, the election result was perceived as a boost to the Congress Party.

Venkataraman served as President of India starting 1987, where he worked with four prime ministers, and appointed three of them: V. P. Singh, Chandra Shekhar and P. V. Narasimha Rao, during his five-year term, which saw the advent of coalition politics in India. His successor S. D. Sharma was the only other Indian President in 20th Century to work with four prime ministers and appoint three of them.

== Post-presidency ==
Venkataraman returned to Chennai after retiring, but moved back to Delhi a few years later.

==Honours==
Venkataraman received the Doctorate of Law (Honoris Causa) from the University of Madras. He is an Honorary Fellow, Madras Medical College; a Doctor of Social Sciences, University of Roorkee; Doctor of Law (Honoris Causa) from the University of Burdwan. He was awarded the Tamra Patra for participation in the freedom struggle, the Soviet Land Prize for his travelogue on K. Kamaraj&#x27;s visit to the Socialist countries. He was the recipient of a Souvenir from the Secretary-General of the United Nations for distinguished service as President of the U.N. Administrative Tribunal. The title of &quot;Sat Seva Ratna&quot; was conferred on him by the Sankaracharya of Kancheepuram. He was a great devotee of the Paramacharya of Kanchi.

==Illness and death==
On 12 January 2009, Venkataraman was admitted to the Army Hospital (then Research and Referral) in New Delhi with complaints of Urosepsis (sepsis caused by a urinary tract infection). His condition grew critical on 20 January, when he was detected with low blood pressure and &quot;E. coli&quot; tract infection.

Venkataraman died at the age of 98 on 27 January 2009 at 14:30 IST, due to multiple organ failure. Since he died on the day after Republic Day, some programmes coinciding it were cancelled to mark the respect towards the late former President. He was cremated with full state honours at Ekta Sthal near Raj Ghat. President Pratibha Patil, Vice President Mohammad Hamid Ansari, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and various other leaders condoled his death.

== Personal life ==
He was married to Janaki Venkataraman, and had a daughter.

<text>The Amiga A570 is a single-speed external CD-ROM drive for the Amiga 500 computer launched by Commodore in 1992. It was designed to be compatible with Commodore CDTV software as well as being able to read ordinary ISO 9660 CD-ROM discs.

The original designation was A690, and pre-production devices under this name were delivered to developers. The A690/A570 used a proprietary Mitsumi CD-ROM interface. It contained a header for an internal fast memory expansion, but this proprietary memory module was never put into production and only a few rare developer examples of this exist today.

It is also notable that by the time of the A570&#x27;s launch, the A500 computer had already been discontinued. The Amiga 600 (ostensibly the A500&#x27;s direct replacement) was, like the later A1200, incompatible with this external drive. Thus, Commodore were in the position of having launched a CD-ROM drive for a discontinued machine, while a similar device was unavailable for their current low-end Amiga. This move by Commodore marketing department could be justified by the fact that millions of A500 systems existed already, along with considerable demand for Commodore to release a more advanced data storage solution.

The device (like the Amiga A590 hard disk drive that was sold by Commodore for the A500) had no through connector, so it was not possible to connect both an A590 and an A570 to the computer at the same time. The A590, despite having an XT IDE hard disk, also carried a SCSI interface that allowed third-party hard disks and CD-ROM drives to be fitted. While these drives did not carry CDTV emulation, the lack of success of the CDTV format made this a null disadvantage for most users.

==Features==
* Single speed CD-ROM reader
* Headphone jack on the front panel
* Audio control knob on the front panel to adjust the volume of the headphones if connected, it did not change the volume out of the rear ports as they are designed to go to an amplified speaker setup which will have their own controls
* Stereo audio in and stereo audio out connectors. The audio in connects from the A500 to the A570 and the audio out goes to the speakers (or monitor).
* 2 Megabyte RAM internal interface connector
* Rear connector bay port to add a SCSI interface card

CDs could not be inserted directly into the A570 and needed to be put in a caddy before being inserted into the reader slot.

The A570 had no need for drivers. It was automatically recognized as a standard Amiga expansion card by the Amiga Zorro bus Autoconfig feature. Programs for playing Audio CDs were available on a bundled &#x27;A570 Tools&#x27; floppy disk, public domain software disk collections, and then on Aminet.

The A570 also featured an external power supply, which was the same model as the A500 power supply.

<text>Giovanni Battista Venturi (11 September 1746 – 10 September 1822) was an Italian physicist, savant, man of letters, diplomat and historian of science. He was the discoverer of the Venturi effect, which was described in 1797 in his &quot;Recherches Experimentales sur le Principe de la Communication Laterale du Mouvement dans les Fluides appliqué a l&#x27;Explication de Differens Phenomènes Hydrauliques&quot;, translated into English by William Nicholson as &quot;Experimental Inquiries Concerning the Principle of the Lateral Communication of a Motion in Fluids,&quot; and published in 1836 in Thomas Tredgold&#x27;s &quot;Tracts on Hydraulics&quot;. Because of this discovery, he is the eponym for the Venturi effect, Venturi tube, Venturi flow meter, and the Venturi pump.

==Career==
Born in Bibbiano, Italy, in the Province of Reggio Emilia, Giovanni was a contemporary of Lagrange and Laplace, and a pupil of Lazzaro Spallanzani. He was ordained as a priest in 1769, at the age of 23, and in the same year was appointed as teacher of logic at the seminary of Reggio Emilia, where he had earlier received an education. In 1774 he became a professor of geometry and philosophy at the University of Modena. He later held the posts of ducal mathematician, state engineer, and auditor under the Duke of Modena. As state engineer he was responsible for bridge construction, rectification of water courses, draining of marsh land, and the establishment of State regulations for dam construction. In 1786 he was given the post of professor of experimental physics at the University of Modena, where he organized a laboratory, equipping it with state-of-the-art equipment. During this time he was also able to complete the town of Modena&#x27;s historical memoirs, which had been left incomplete following the death of Girolamo Tiraboschi, the appointed historian.

==Fluid mechanics==

Venturi moved to Paris as Secretary of a delegation sent by the Duke of Modena to undertake negotiations with the Supreme Executive Council. Following unsuccessful negotiations, he remained in there for a year and a half to improve his knowledge of physics and chemistry. While in Paris, he came into contact with some of the most learned scholars of the age, such as Georges Cuvier, René Just Haüy, Jean-Baptiste Biot, Jérôme Lalande, Gaspard Monge, Pierre-Simon Laplace, and many more. He also published several treatises, including the famous &quot;Venturi effect&quot; treatise of 1797. However, Venturi&#x27;s design was not applied to a practical apparatus until 1888, when Clemens Herschel was awarded a patent for the first commercial model of a Venturi tube. This was followed in 1926 by Cecil Aggeler&#x27;s bachelor&#x27;s thesis, &quot;Design of a Venturi Type Current Meter.&quot;

==Historian of science==
Another of Venturi&#x27;s treatises demonstrated his abilities as a historian of science. He was the first to call attention to the importance of Leonardo da Vinci as a scientist, rather than simply as an artist, in the 1797 booklet, &quot;Essai sur les ouvrages physico-mathématiques de Léonard de Vinci.&quot; He has also worked on hydraulics with him. They were considered to be the first to study tribology.

Jérôme Lalande, Director of the Paris Observatory, commended Venturi 
to General Napoleon Bonaparte as &quot;one of the men most competent to bring renown to Italy and to build there useful waterworks and do good work in mathematics and physics,&quot; and praised his ability in the art of civil engineering and military architecture. The Abbé Venturi used Napoleon&#x27;s influence and protection to frustrate the intrigues of those in his country who tried to oust him from his position at the University. Bonaparte made him a member of the Corps législatif, professor at the Military School of Modena, and Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. Adverse political influences subjected Venturi to many vicissitudes, even leading to imprisonment. But after the conquest of Italy, the First Consul Napoleon gave him a professorship at the University of Pavia, and he was assigned several diplomatic missions. Venturi also continued to apply his engineering expertise in mine work and hydraulic construction.

Later, he was made Diplomatic Agent of the Helvetic Confederation, and spent twelve years in Switzerland. He retired in 1813, due to failing health, and was granted a pension on the maximum scale by the Emperor Napoleon. On his return to Reggio he set about the publication of a number of scientific and literary works. In 1814 Venturi wrote &quot;Commentari sopra la storia e le teorie dell&#x27; ottica&quot; (Commentaries about the history and theory of optics), which included Hero of Alexandria&#x27;s treatise on the dioptra and from 1818 to 1821 he compiled, edited and published many of Galileo&#x27;s manuscripts and letters in &quot;Memorie e lettere inedite finora o disperse di Galileo Galilei, ordinate e illustrate con annotazioni.&quot; He was also the first author who acknowledged Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s work on tribology, publishing a commentary on some Leonardo&#x27;s notebooks, written between 1493-4 and 1515, which have been transferred from the Ambrosian Library in Milan to Paris after the Napoleon’s conquest of northern Italy. 

Venturi died at Reggio Emilia in September 1822, at the age of seventy-five.

<doc id="754199" wikidata="Q2834051" url="?curid=754199" title="Beer Bad">
<text>&quot;Beer Bad&quot; is the fifth episode of the fourth season of the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. The episode aired on The WB on November 2, 1999. It is written by Tracey Forbes and directed by David Solomon. It was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Hairstyling in a Series.

The episode, generally unpopular, shows Buffy and some classmates getting drunk on beer brewed by a warlock, with ensuing hijinks. Willow worries about Oz&#x27;s attraction to Veruca, a singer in a band playing at the Bronze.

== Plot synopsis ==
Buffy is still hurting because classmate Parker dumped her after a night together. In a daydream during one of Professor Walsh&#x27;s classes (pointedly, about the role of the id in Freudian psychology) she saves Parker&#x27;s life and he swears to do anything to get her back. A dialogue with Willow later shows how much Buffy is not over him yet.

In the real world, Xander gets a job as a bartender with a fake ID, and has to endure the behavior of college students so puffed up with their feeling of entitlement as to drip elitist insults upon Xander. He gets to test his empathy skills with none other than Buffy, who proceeds to get drunk on &quot;Black Frost&quot; beer with four college boys.

Oz and Willow are in The Bronze together, but he feels a strange connection to the pretty singer Veruca when she gets on the stage with her band &quot;Shy&quot;. The next morning, Willow has to cope not only with jealousy over Veruca (whom she calls a &quot;groupie&quot;), but also with Buffy, who seems to be suffering from &quot;Black Frost.&quot;

That evening when Buffy drinks herself drunk, it is soon revealed why: somebody has set up a chemical lab and is putting more into the beer than just malt. Xander finally sends Buffy home. When her four drinking buddies turn into violent Neanderthals, he learns that the owner of the pub has been adding a mystical potion, which a warlock taught him, to make ensorcelled beer as revenge for 20 years&#x27; worth of college kids taunting him. Despite the pub owner explaining that the effects wear off after a day or so, Xander heads off, knowing the damage that could be done in that time. While the boys escape to the streets of Sunnydale, Xander gets Giles to help. They find Buffy drawing cave paintings on her dorm wall and saying &quot;Parker bad.&quot; Giles and Xander are unable to keep Buffy in her room when she gets a craving for more beer.

Meanwhile, Willow confronts Parker with what he has done to Buffy. When he turns his charm on her she plays along, then asks just how gullible he thinks she is, before launching into a rant about how primitive men are. Just then, the Neanderthal students burst into the room. They knock Willow and Parker unconscious and start a fire that rapidly burns out of control. Xander catches up with Buffy and when they see smoke from the Neanderthals&#x27; fire, they rush to help. Though afraid of the flames and unable to figure out how to use an extinguisher, Buffy saves Willow, Parker, two students captured by the Neanderthals, and her erstwhile drinking buddies. In the end, Parker thanks Buffy for saving his life and apologizes, just the way she had dreamt — only to be coldcocked by a club-wielding Buffy. The Neanderthal students are subsequently locked into a van by Xander, to be confined until back to normal.

== Writing and acting ==
&quot;Beer Bad&quot; is written with a classic frame structure — Buffy&#x27;s dream — that emphasizes her development; hitting Parker with a stick qualifies as poetic justice. Producer Doug Petrie says, despite the intensely negative reaction of the fans to seeing Buffy being &quot;battered about by the forces of college&quot; and being treated so callously by Parker, they had to &quot;ride that out&quot; until this episode because &quot;we didn&#x27;t want her to find her strength immediately in this new setting&quot;.

However, the most striking feature of &quot;Beer Bad&quot; is the twinning of morality and the moral of the story: Beer and casual sex are bad. In a BBC interview, Petrie states: &quot;Well, very young people get unlimited access to alcohol and become horrible! We all do it — or most of us do it — and live to regret it, and we wanted to explore that.&quot;

In an interview, David Solomon revealed doubts he and Whedon had about the quality of the episode: &quot;The fourth season&#x27;s Beer Bad wasn&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s cup of tea, especially with Buffy fans. Solomon had some doubts about this episode but it turned out to be better than he expected. &quot;Joss wasn&#x27;t entirely pleased with this story,&quot; he says. &quot;He came into my office at the last minute with the script and said to me, &#x27;I tried to make it better but all I did was make it funnier.&#x27; I took that to mean, &#x27;We&#x27;re not exactly sure what this is supposed to be about so just enjoy yourself.&#x27; So I actually had a ball doing it. It was a laugh to watch frat boys turn into cavemen and have Buffy affected by the same thing that was affecting them. We just let everyone go &#x27;crazy&#x27; and nothing all bad came out of it.&quot;

While &quot;Beer Bad&quot; is often called one of the worst episodes by fans and critics, Whedon has a different perspective on the episode: &quot;It&#x27;s interesting, every single episode contains an attempt to do something real, and contains at least one or two lines that crack me up, or one or two moments that genuinely shock me. I know there are ones that are not favorites among fans. And there are definitely ones where I scratch my head and go, &quot;You know, this seemed a great idea on paper.&quot; But I never actually singled one out and went, &quot;Here&#x27;s a total failure.&quot; ... &quot;Everyone always talks about the Frankenstein one, but I think it has some beautiful stuff in it. And I think the same thing about &quot;Beer Bad,&quot; where Buffy goes all cave man. A lot of people groan at that one, but I think it has some lovely stuff in it.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Vox&quot;, ranking it at #144 of all 144 episodes (i.e., the worst), writes, &quot;It speaks volumes about the quality of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; that the episode almost universally agreed to be the worst of the series still manages to boast some sharp dialogue, physical and verbal humor, and even a dang Emmy nomination (for Makeup and Hairstyling). Still, let us not gloss over the bad, which, as this show goes, is very bad: We get yet another episode of Buffy moping over terrible Parker, the introduction of the odious she-werewolf Veruca, and a very silly, very preachy story about the awfulness of college students drinking beer (oh, the horror).&quot;

Billie Doux, giving a rating of 1 out of 4 stakes, writes, &quot;It&#x27;s tempting to say &quot;episode bad!&quot; So it wasn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d call great, but it was fun — especially in a bashing-the-poophead sense. Plus we have the blatant comparison of male college students with prehistoric morons who really want nothing but booze and sex.&quot; She calls it &quot;a great scene&quot; when Willow seems to succumb to Parker&#x27;s smarmy charms, but instead challenges him: &quot;Just how gullible do you think I am?&quot;

A BBC reviewer complained about its &quot;American puritanism&quot;
and &quot;Slayage&quot; criticized writer Tracey Forbes for delivering a trite and obvious message in a series containing &quot;such an abundant feminist subtext&quot;.
However, Todd Hertz of &quot;Christianity Today&quot; used this episode of an example of the show&#x27;s honest portrayal of consequences. The episode remains the lowest rated of the series on film and television aggregation site IMDb.

=== Controversy ===

This plot was written with the plan to take advantage of funds from the Office of National Drug Control Policy available to shows that promoted an anti-drug message.
Funding was rejected for the episode because &quot;[d]rugs were an issue, but ... [it] was otherworldly nonsense, very abstract and not like real-life kids taking drugs. Viewers wouldn&#x27;t make the link to [the ONDCP&#x27;s] message.&quot;

==Notes==
:1.Willow scolds, &quot;I got your number, id boy. ... I mean, you men. It&#x27;s all about the sex! You find a woman, drag her to your den, do whatever&#x27;s necessary just as long as you get the sex. I tell you, men haven&#x27;t changed since the dawn of time.&quot;

<doc id="754200" wikidata="Q1344139" url="?curid=754200" title="Joe Venuti">
<text>Giuseppe &quot;Joe&quot; Venuti (September 16, 1903 – August 14, 1978) was an American jazz musician and pioneer jazz violinist.

Considered the father of jazz violin, he pioneered the use of string instruments in jazz along with the guitarist Eddie Lang, a friend since childhood. Through the 1920s and early 1930s, Venuti and Lang made many recordings as leader and as featured soloists. He and Lang became so well known for their &#x27;hot&#x27; violin and guitar solos that on many commercial dance recordings they were hired to do 12- or 24-bar duos towards the end of otherwise stock dance arrangements. In 1926, Venuti and Lang started recording for the OKeh label as a duet (after a solitary duet issued on Columbia), followed by &quot;Blue Four&quot; combinations, which are considered milestone jazz recordings. Venuti also recorded commercial dance records for OKeh under the name &quot;New Yorkers&quot;.

He worked with Benny Goodman, Adrian Rollini, the Dorsey Brothers, Bing Crosby, Bix Beiderbecke, Jack Teagarden, Frank Signorelli, the Boswell Sisters, and most of the other important white jazz and semi-jazz figures of the late 1920s and early 1930s. However, following Lang&#x27;s death in 1933, Venuti&#x27;s career began to wane, though he continued performing through the 1930s, recording a series of commercial dance records (usually containing a Venuti violin solo) for the dime store labels, as well as OKeh and Columbia, plus the occasional jazz small group sessions. He was also a strong early influence on western swing players like Cecil Brower. Many of the 1920s OKeh sides continued to sell and remained in print through 1935 when ARC discontinued the OKeh label and reissued selected sides on the 35-cent Vocalion label (the OKeh label was revived by CBS in 1940).
After a period of relative obscurity in the 1940s and 1950s, Venuti played violin and other instruments with Jack Statham at the Desert Inn Hotel in Las Vegas. Statham headed several musical groups that played at the Desert Inn from late 1961 until 1965, including a Dixieland combo. Venuti was with him during that time, and was active with the Las Vegas Symphony Orchestra during the 1960s. He was &#x27;rediscovered&#x27; in the late 1960s. In the 1970s, he established a musical relationship with tenor saxophonist Zoot Sims resulting in three recordings. In 1976, he recorded an album of duets with pianist Earl Hines entitled &quot;Hot Sonatas&quot;. He also recorded an entire album with country-jazz musicians including mandolinist Jethro Burns (of Homer &amp; Jethro), pedal steel guitarist Curly Chalker and former Bob Wills sideman and guitarist Eldon Shamblin. Venuti died in Seattle, Washington.

==Early life==

Venuti was well known for giving out conflicting information regarding his early life, including his birthplace and birth date as well as his education and upbringing. Gary Giddins summarized the situation by saying that &quot;depending on which reference book you consult, (Venuti&#x27;s age when he died in 1978) was eighty-four, eighty-two, eighty, seventy-five, seventy-four, or seventy-two. Venuti, who surely had one of the strangest senses of humor in music history, encouraged the confusion. (...) The deception has been variously traced to Venuti&#x27;s father, who hoped to speed up the naturalization process, to Joe&#x27;s fear that a foreign-born jazz musician would not be taken seriously by his peers, and to his general penchant for mayhem.&quot;

According to official records, he was born on September 16, 1903, in Philadelphia.

He was classically trained in the violin from a young age, and studied solfeggio with his grandfather. He later said that while he studied music from him, he did not learn any one instrument but rather music theory in general. He began studying the violin in Philadelphia, and later claimed to have studied at a conservatory, without providing any corroborating details. Despite this, his style of playing was characteristic of someone who had a solid basis in violin technique.

==Career==

Venuti began playing violin professionally in 1924.During this time, he helped redefine jazz violin. He spent time in the early 1900s playing in the James Campbell School Orchestra in the violin section. It was there that he first met and befriended Salvatore Massaro, who was also playing in the same section. During this time the pair was experimenting with jazz and blues in addition to classical playing.

In 1924, he moved to Detroit to join Jean Goldkette&#x27;s band, and began playing with the Book Cadillac Hotel Orchestra, one of Goldkette&#x27;s dance bands. It was here that he made his first recordings with Goldkette&#x27;s big band. By mid-1925, he had moved to Atlantic City briefly to play with Bert Estlow&#x27;s band before settling in New York. Here, he once again encountered Massaro, who had changed his name to Eddie Lang. Lang had also switched instruments from the violin to the guitar. The two friends struck up a professional partnership which was to last until Lang&#x27;s death in 1933. They began playing with Roger Wolfe Kahn&#x27;s dance orchestras in addition to playing in Broadway pit orchestras to support themselves.

From 1926 to 1928, the Venuti and Lang duo were recording with most of the leading jazz musicians of the day, including Goldkette (1926–27), Red Nichols (1927–28), Bix Beiderbecke (1927), Adrian Rollini (1927) and Frankie Trumbauer (1927). Between 1927 and 1929, Lang and Venuti were leading bands and performing in Atlantic City. Venuti then returned to New York in 1929 to play with Paul Whiteman&#x27;s orchestra from 1929 to 1931. He also appeared in the film &quot;King of Jazz&quot; (1930) with the band. From the period of 1931–1933, Venuti recorded again with Eddie Lang, Bix Beiderbecke and Frankie Trumbauer. The most famous recording of Venuti&#x27;s career was also produced during this time: his October 22, 1931, recording with Joe Venuti-Eddie Lang and their All Star orchestra. This session also included Benny Goodman and Jack Teagarden. Both Venuti and Lang rejoined Roger Wolfe Kahns&#x27; orchestra in 1932 and played and recorded with him until Eddie Lang&#x27;s death in 1933.

Following Eddie Lang&#x27;s death, Venuti conducted a tour of Europe and the UK. During this period he also alternated from violin to guitar, varying from his almost strictly violin approach formerly. Upon returning to the US in 1935, he formed a big band and worked as its leader. During this time he also composed most of his original arrangements. Venuti was less successful as a big band leader than as a soloist, and the band folded in 1943.

After this period, Venuti transitioned from being in a position of relative prominence to one of ignominy. Venuti moved to California in 1944 to become a studio musician with MGM, in addition to playing with other film and radio studios. He also appeared regularly on Bing Crosby&#x27;s radio show during this time. Later, Venuti returned to a small group format and continued to play and record in and around Los Angeles, while touring frequently. In 1953, he conducted another tour of Europe, and in 1963 a tour of Seattle.

Throughout much of the 1950s, Venuti made records and played at clubs. This was the beginning of about a 15-year lull in Venuti&#x27;s career. In the early 1960s, Venuti was mostly inactive due to alcoholism. The late 1960s marked a revival in his career. In 1967, he was invited to perform at Dick Gibson&#x27;s Colorado Jazz Party, and was such a success that he would be asked to repeat his performances annually until his death in 1978. In 1968, he was also invited to the Newport Jazz Festival, and in 1969 he performed at the London Jazz Expo.

Living in Seattle in 1973 he was featured in the short film, &quot;Thank You Joe&quot;. A portion of the film was shot at the District Tavern in Seattle with Venuti sitting in with the New Deal Rhythm band led by John Holte.

During the 1970s, in his last years, Venuti toured extensively in Europe with a small ensemble. During this time, he made his final recordings with Earl Hines, George Barnes, Ross Tompkins, Dave McKenna, Marian McPartland, Scott Hamilton, Leon Redbone, and Zoot Sims. Venuti continued to tour and play until his death in 1978.

===Playing style===
Venuti pioneered the violin as a solo instrument to the jazz world. He was known for a fast, &quot;hot&quot; playing style characteristic of jazz soloists in the 1920s. His solos have been described as incredibly rhythmic with patterns of duplets and running eighth and sixteenth notes. He favored a lively, fast tempo that showed off his superior technique. Venuti was a virtuosic player with a wide range of techniques, including left-hand pizzicato and runs spanning the length of the fingerboard.

He also frequently implemented slides common in blues and country fiddle playing. Occasionally, he used an uncommon technique in which he unscrewed the end of his bow and wrapped the bow hair around the strings of the violin, allowing him to play chords, lending the subsequent sound a &quot;wild&quot; tone. He was particularly active in small ensemble jazz, since — prior to the invention of the musical amplifier — the force of the horns in big band jazz was sufficient to drown out the violin.

==Compositions==
Joe Venuti&#x27;s compositions included &quot;Satan&#x27;s Holiday&quot;, &quot;Goin&#x27; Home&quot;, &quot;Put and Take&quot;, &quot;Pretty Trix&quot;, &quot;Doin&#x27; Things&quot; with Eddie Lang, &quot;Apple Blossoms&quot;, with Lennie Hayton, Frankie Trumbauer, and Eddie Lang, &quot;Beatin&#x27; the Dog&quot;, &quot;Black and Blue Bottom&quot;, &quot;Black Satin&quot;, &quot;Blues for Nobody&quot;, &quot;Blues in G&quot;, &quot;Blues Inc.&quot;, &quot;Dandy Cat&quot;, &quot;Cheese and Crackers&quot;, &quot;Clown Cat&quot;, &quot;Dinner at Nine&quot;, &quot;Flip&quot;, and &quot;Betcha I Getcha&quot;, which Venuti claimed to have co-written with Bix Beiderbecke.

===Practical jokes===
Apart from his impressive playing style, Joe Venuti was known for his practical jokes. He was known to play inexpensive violins, since many of his former band members have said that he had been known to crack these over the heads of other musicians on occasion. There are many anecdotes of his pranks told by his associates. In one account, he filled a tuba player&#x27;s horn with flour during a break in a rehearsal. Another involved sending the one-armed trumpeter Wingy Manone a single cufflink for Christmas. He was also well known for having called every bass player in the New York phonebook and asking them to meet with him on a street corner. When over 50 bass players arrived with their instruments it created a minor roadblock. He then subsequently had to pay the players for their time as mandated by the AFM. Venuti once tipped the inebriated and unconscious Bix Beiderbecke into a bath filled with purple jello.

==Personal life==
Little is known about Venuti&#x27;s personal life aside from his extensive jazz career. Some of his many biographers claim that he was married three times. In a 1934 passenger list he is stated traveling with his wife Sarah Venuti (née Israel). They got married in August 1934. Wingy Manone reported that Venuti was married to a woman named &quot;Sally&quot;, and in 1950, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported on his divorce from a woman named &quot;Dorothy&quot;.

Venuti suffered from alcoholism in his middle age, throughout the 1950s and early 1960s. He was able to recover, and to regain his former acclaim for his playing. In 1970, Venuti was diagnosed with cancer. He died on August 14, 1978, in Seattle, Washington, of either cancer or a heart attack.

<text>Mykhailo Mykhailovych Verbytskyi ( ; March 4, 1815 – December 7, 1870), was a Ukrainian composer and a priest of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. He is considered to be one of the first professional composers of Galicia. He is best known for composing the melody to the national anthem of Ukraine.

Verbytskyi&#x27;s national anthem became widely played by orchestras and musicians around the world in support of Ukraine as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==Biography==
Mykhailo Verbytskyi was born in Nadsiannia. Sources often differ as to the exact location of his birth, with some claiming he was born in Jawornik Ruski and christened 8 km away in Ulucz (the site of the oldest wooden church in Poland where his father was the local priest). Both are now located in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship, Poland.

Verbytskyi as born into the family of a priest. He was left an orphan at the age of ten, and was raised from then on by his father&#x27;s brother, Bishop Ivan Snihurskyi. Snihurskyi took Mykhailo to live with him in Peremyshl, where his uncle was very active: founding the city&#x27;s first Ukrainian language printing press, published compilations of folklore and textbooks about the Ukrainian language. In 1818, Snihurskyi even founded a diak-teaching institute in the city, and ten years later, a cathedral choir and music school. Verbytskyi was therefore placed in a very active and creative environment.

In 1833, Verbytskyi entered the Theological Seminary in Lviv. Here he became seriously engaged in music, learning to play the guitar, which became his favourite musical instrument. He eventually wrote a textbook teaching how to play the guitar and wrote pieces for the instrument. Because of financial problems, he twice had to leave the Seminary, but he eventually graduated and became a priest.

By the order of Father Y. Lozinsky (the then governor of Yavoriv County), in May 1852, he was transferred to the parish of the village of Zaluzhia in Yavoriv County, where he served until August 1853.
From 1853 to 1856, he served as the administrator of the chapel on the hill in the village of Strilky in the Sambir raion of Lviv oblast. The chapel, built in 1792, did not survive, but on its site now stands the Church of St. Eustace, which is listed as a local landmark. A memorial plaque indicates that Father Mykhailo Verbytskyi served in the church. Below the hill stood a wooden rectory where he once lived. However, it did not survive either, as a new one was built on its site in 1902. The local school is named after him, and for fifteen years now, festivals of spiritual music named after Father Mykhailo Verbytskyi have been held in Strilky, attracting the best church and school choirs from the district and the region.

In 1859 Verbytskyi received a parish in the village of Mlyny, Yavorskyi county, where he would live and work for the rest of his life. As a priest he wrote many liturgical compositions, which are still sung throughout the Galicia region. Some of these include Єдинородний Сине (Only-begotten Son), Святий Боже (Holy God), Алилуя (Alleluia), Отче наш (Our Father), and Хваліте Господа з небес (Praise the Lord from the heavens).

== Music ==
As a composer he helped lay the foundations for the development of modern Ukrainian music. His works are formally unsophisticated, often strophic, and usually in the minor mode; but his stage works (notably &quot;Prostachka&quot; (‘The Simpleton’), 1870) are representative of a popular folk genre that was melodically fluid, singable, pictorial and emotionally evocative. His instrumental writing does not extend far beyond the simple development of folktunes. Nevertheless, he composed 12 symphonies (overtures), on the sixth of which Stanyslav Lyudkevych based an orchestral piece and a piano trio. He also composed &quot;Zapovit&quot; (‘Testament’, 1868), a setting of Shevchenko&#x27;s poem for bass solo, double choir and orchestra, the operetta &quot;Pidhiriany&quot; which was staged in Lemberg (now Lviv, 1864), and numerous sacred and secular choral works and songs. He is best known as the composer of the Ukrainian national anthem by the words of Pavlo Chubynsky &quot;Shche ne vmerla Ukraina&quot; (‘Ukraine has not Perished’), which in 1917 was adopted by the new Ukrainian republican government.

===Compositions===
Musicologist Uliana Petrus has put together a list of 133 known compositions by Mykhailo Verbytskyi. These include:
*Large scale secular choral works - 30
*Sacred choral works - 37
*Vocal ensembles
*Art songs - 10
*Arrangements of folk songs - 10
*Orchestral works - 18 works including 9 symphonies
*Chamber works
*15 works for various instruments
* Music to 12 stage works

==Commemoration==
In 2005 the chapel-pantheon over the tomb of Mykhailo Verbytskyi was opened to mark the 140th anniversary of Ukrainian national anthem and 190th anniversary of its composer.

<text>Robert Anthony Grich (born January 15, 1949) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a second baseman for the Baltimore Orioles (–) and the California Angels (–). In 1981, Grich led the American League in home runs and won a Silver Slugger Award. A six-time All-Star, he also excelled as a defensive player, winning four consecutive Gold Glove Awards between 1973 and 1976.

In 1988, Grich became the first inductee into the California Angels Hall of Fame; he was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame in 1998. Grich currently works in the Angels&#x27; front office.

==Baseball career==
Grich attended Woodrow Wilson High School in Long Beach, California, and graduated in 1967. He was selected by the Baltimore Orioles in the first round (19th overall) of the 1967 Major League Baseball draft. Grich made his major league debut with Baltimore midway through the 1970 season at the age of 21. He struggled early in his career and received &quot;encouragement&quot; from manager Earl Weaver, who would say &quot;Home run in Rochester&quot; to him each time he flied out; in Rochester, he batted .383. That October, the Orioles defeated the Cincinnati Reds to win the World Series, with him on the playoff roster but not seeing any action.

From 1969 through 1974, the Orioles featured a loaded roster that resulted in five AL East Division titles in six seasons. In 1971, he excelled when with the Rochester Red Wings, winning the International League Most Valuable Player Award of the International League; so important was Grich that, when he had obligations that didn&#x27;t let him play (such as military service or a late promotion to Baltimore), the Red Wings went 1-11 without him. Grich&#x27;s emergence was blocked by incumbent second baseman Davey Johnson, but the Orioles thought highly of Grich and traded Johnson to the Braves following the 1972 season, when the Orioles finished third in the division.

In 1973, Grich set an all-time major league fielding record with a .995 fielding percentage, and 12 seasons later in 1985, he broke the record again (.997). He won four consecutive Gold Glove Awards and made the American League All-Star squad six times. He was an excellent fielder, with good range, soft hands, and a good arm, and he was steady turning the double play. He credited Orioles hitting instructor Jim Frey for instructing him in helping to inprove his swing. He also learned infield defensive play from teammate Brooks Robinson, specifically, positioning his feet close together to get a better jump on a batted ball.

Grich became a free agent following the 1976 season and signed a multi-year contract with the California Angels. The Orioles offered him $1.2 million and the New York Yankees offered $2.2 million, but Grich accepted the Angels and their offer of $1.5 million due to a desire to play closer to home. The Angels originally planned to move Grich to shortstop, as they had Jerry Remy at second. However, Grich suffered a herniated disk in his back trying to move an air-conditioning unit during the 1977 season and played in only 52 games. The Angels traded Remy to the Boston Red Sox for Don Aase and moved Grich back to second for the 1978 season. Grich batted .294 in 1979, adding 30 homers and 101 RBI as the Angels made the postseason in 1979 for the first time ever as champions of the American League West. So happy was the clubhouse in celebration that, when former President Richard Nixon came out to the clubhouse to congratulate them, Grich dumped a can of beer over Nixon&#x27;s head.

In the strike-shortened 1981 season, Grich tied for the league lead in home runs (22, along with Tony Armas, Dwight Evans, and Eddie Murray), led in slugging average (.543), and hit a career-high .304.

While with the Orioles, Grich appeared in the American League Championship Series (ALCS) in 1973 and 1974, when Baltimore lost to Oakland.

==Retirement after 1986 ALCS==
The Angels made their first three postseason appearances during Grich&#x27;s tenure, but fell in the ALCS each time; losing to the Orioles in 1979 and to the Milwaukee Brewers in 1982. Grich came closest in his final MLB season (1986), when the Angels led the ALCS 3-1 and needed just one more win to advance to the World Series. They blew a 5–2 lead to the Boston Red Sox in the ninth inning of Game 5, then lost the next two and were eliminated. Grich hit a home run in Game 5 that deflected off center fielder Dave Henderson&#x27;s glove, putting the Angels on top 3–2. But with the Red Sox down to their final strike, Henderson hit a home run to put Boston ahead. In the post-game interviews following Game 7, Grich announced his retirement at the age of 37.

==Legacy==
Over 17 major league seasons, Grich batted .266, with 320 doubles, 47 triples, 224 home runs, 864 runs batted in (RBI), 1,033 runs, 1,833 hits, 1,087 bases on balls, 104 stolen bases, and a .371 on-base percentage in 2,008 games played. Commenting on his baseball career, he stated: &quot;I was short on talent so I had to be long on intensity.&quot;

===Career Highlights===
* 6-time All-Star (1972, 1974, 1976, 1979–80, 1982)
* 4-time Gold Glove (1973–1976)
* Twice Top 10 MVP (1974, 1979)
* Led league in slugging average (1981)
* Led league in home runs (1981)
* First second baseman to lead AL in home runs since Nap Lajoie (1901) and in either league since Rogers Hornsby (1929).
* Hit three consecutive home runs in a game (1974)
* Set an AL 2B record with 484 putouts in a season (1974)
* The first player elected to the Angels&#x27; Hall of Fame (1996)

==Hall of Fame candidacy==

Grich became eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1992. In the BBWAA election, he received 11 votes, or 2.6% of the vote, below the 5% threshold needed to stay on the ballot. He was therefore removed from future BBWAA ballots.

Using sabermetric statistics there is a compelling case for Grich to be in the Hall of Fame. As of 2017, Grich has the highest Jaffe Wins Above Replacement Score (JAWS) of any eligible position player not in the Hall of Fame, although his standard WAR is lower than that of Bill Dahlen and fellow second baseman Lou Whitaker; of the three second basemen inducted into the Hall of Fame (excluding Veterans Committee picks) since 1992, Grich has a higher WAR than all three. There are more than ten Hall of Fame second basemen with a lower JAWS. The JAWS statistic is particularly compelling given that it incorporates both career and peak year statistics. His 224 home runs as a second baseman ranks highly among the Hall of Famers in the position, as he ranked fourth all-time upon his retirement. In fact, from 1970 to 1986 (the time in which Grich played his career), only Joe Morgan hit more than Grich (228), and Grich was second in additional categories such as RBI, runs scored, hits, doubles, and walks. Grich was one of five second basemen to have at four occasions of at least twelve home runs and eighty walks in a season, which he did seven times, more than players such as Roberto Alomar. In OPS+ for second basemen that played 80% percent at the position with at least 1,000 games played, Grich is tied for fifth best alltime with a 125 OPS+.

In the 2019 edition of the &quot;Bill James Handbook&quot;, James listed Grich as the 5th best position player missing from the Hall, and MLB historian John Thorn has stated Grich as the one player deserving of being reconsidered for the honor of being considered for the Hall of Fame.

<text>Jakob &quot;Jaap&quot; Stam (; born 17 July 1972) is a Dutch professional football coach and former player. As a player, he played as a centre-back and is regarded as one of the best defenders of all-time. Stam was part of the Manchester United team that won the Treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League in 1999.

Stam played for several European clubs including PSV Eindhoven, Manchester United, Lazio, Milan and Ajax before retiring in October 2007. As well as winning numerous club trophies including an Eredivisie, a Coppa Italia, an Intercontinental Cup and three Premier League titles, he won several personal awards including being voted the best defender in both the 1998–99 and 1999–2000 UEFA Champions Leagues as well as being in three consecutive PFA Team of the Year sides from 1999 to 2001. Stam played 67 international matches for the Netherlands, scoring three goals. He was in their squads for three UEFA European Championships and the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

After retiring as a player, Stam worked as a coach at PEC Zwolle and Ajax. He later managed Feyenoord in 2019 and FC Cincinnati of Major League Soccer.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in Kampen, Overijssel, Stam started his career with local amateur football club DOS Kampen. On 15 August 1992, Stam made his professional debut for FC Zwolle in a 1–1 draw against SC Heracles in the Eerste Divisie. He moved to Eredivisie club Cambuur Leeuwarden for the following season, but was relegated in his first season. Two seasons at Cambuur earned him a transfer to Eredivisie club Willem II. At Willem II, he immediately impressed at the Eredivisie level, which meant his final breakthrough.

Stam transferred to PSV Eindhoven where he won the KNVB Cup in 1995–96, his first professional trophy. He won the 1996–97 Eredivisie, as well as the Johan Cruyff Shield. Individually, Stam won the VVCS Footballer of the Year award.

===Manchester United===
In April 1998, Stam became the then most expensive defender in history when Manchester United bought him on a five-year contract for £10.6 million. PSV initially valued him at £15 million, but accepted the lower offer after Stam waived his right to 15% of the fee.

Stam spent three seasons at Manchester United, during which time United won three Premier League titles, one FA Cup, the Intercontinental Cup and the UEFA Champions League. He scored his only goal for the club in a 6–2 away victory against Leicester City.

In the 1999 UEFA Champions League final, Stam&#x27;s centre-back partner Ronny Johnsen conceded a free kick on the edge of the penalty area when he brought down Bayern Munich&#x27;s Carsten Jancker in the first few minutes. Mario Basler scored the free kick and Bayern held the lead for 85 minutes before United scored two goals in added time to win the tournament.

Early in the 2001–02 season, Stam was controversially sold to Lazio in Italy after Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson was reportedly upset by allegations Stam had made in his autobiography &quot;Head to Head&quot; about the club. Stam made numerous statements in the book about his views on opposing players, and alleged that Ferguson&#x27;s approach to buy him was done without the permission of PSV. Later, Simon Kuper reported that contrary to initial belief, Ferguson had noticed that Stam&#x27;s tackling numbers were declining and simply assumed the defender was past his playing peak. Laurent Blanc was signed as his replacement.

In 2007, however, Ferguson described the decision to sell Stam as an error: &quot;At the time he had just come back from an achilles injury and we thought he had just lost a little bit. We got the offer from Lazio, £16.5m for a centre back who was 29. It was an offer I couldn&#x27;t refuse. But in playing terms it was a mistake. He is still playing for Ajax at a really good level.&quot; On the financial report, Manchester United announced the fee was £15.3 million; Lazio declared the fee was £16 million.

===Lazio===
During his time with Lazio, Stam was found guilty of having the banned steroid nandrolone in his system following a Serie A game, and received a five-month ban, which was eventually reduced by a month after appeals. He was the second Lazio player suspended in 2001, after Fernando Couto. 
In his last season at the club, he won the Coppa Italia.

===AC Milan===
Stam joined AC Milan after UEFA Euro 2004. He reached his second Champions League final with the &quot;Rossoneri&quot; in 2005, but was a runner-up after his team was defeated by Liverpool in a penalty shoot-out.

===Ajax===
On 30 January 2006, it was announced that he would return to the Eredivisie and play for Ajax, where he signed a two-year contract for a €2.5 million transfer fee. Stam was named team captain upon his arrival at the club. In his first season, he won both the Johan Cruyff Shield and the KNVB Cup; another Johan Cruyff Shield was added to his trophies at the start of the 2007–08 season.

On 29 October 2007, Stam announced his retirement from professional football with immediate effect after playing six league games for Ajax in the 2007–08 league season. His final game was in a 0–0 draw against NEC on 20 October 2007.

==International career==

Stam made his debut for the Netherlands on 24 April 1996 in a 1–0 friendly defeat to Germany in Rotterdam. He was not initially chosen for UEFA Euro 1996, but was later added to the squad after an injury ruled out Frank de Boer; he did not however make any appearances at the tournament. He scored his first goal on 6 September 1997 in a 3–1 home win over rivals Belgium in World Cup qualification. He was also an important player in the Dutch team that finished fourth in the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

During UEFA Euro 2000, he once again reached the semi-finals with the Dutch team, hosted in his home country and Belgium. Stam missed his attempt in the penalty shoot-out in the semi-finals, hitting the ball over the bar in a defeat against Italy. He was not originally scheduled to take a penalty, but had to due to substitutions and fatigue among his teammates.

Stam reached his third semi-finals in an international competition with his nation at UEFA Euro 2004 in Portugal and retired from international football after the tournament. The reason cited for his international retirement was that he wanted to focus on his new team, Milan, as well as his family.

In total, he played 67 matches for the Netherlands, scoring three goals.

==Playing style==
Considered by several pundits to be one of the best defenders of his generation, as well as one of the greatest Dutch and Premier League defenders in history, Stam played primarily as a centre-back. He was known for possessing &quot;a rare combination of speed, strength and ball-playing ability&quot;, as well as an excellent positional sense and a powerful shot. Due to his wide range of skills, in his prime he was also capable of playing as a full-back on the right flank.

==Post-playing career==
In October 2008, Stam returned to Manchester United as a scout for the club, responsible for most of South America.

===Soccer Aid===
Stam has been involved with Soccer Aid, which puts celebrities and football legends together in two teams (England and Rest of the World) for a charity game in aid of UNICEF. Stam has appeared in five Soccer Aid matches 2008, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018.

==Coaching and managerial career==
In 2009, Stam became an assistant coach for PEC Zwolle, and on 30 October was appointed caretaker manager. Following his stint with Zwolle, Stam signed on for a three-year contract with Ajax in 2013 as an assistant coach, and as defensive coach starting in the 2013–14 Eredivisie season. On 28 May 2014, Stam was revealed as one of the new managers of Jong Ajax, the reserve team in the Eerste Divisie. He was joined by Andries Ulderink and they signed a contract beginning on 1 July 2014 and lasting until 30 June 2016.

===Reading===
On 13 June 2016, Stam was appointed as manager of English Championship club Reading on an initial two-year contract. He enjoyed a successful first season with the club, leading them to the Championship play-offs. On 4 July 2017, Stam signed a new two-year contract extension with Reading, keeping him at the club until 2019. On 21 March 2018, Reading announced that Stam had left the club with immediate effect following a run of one win in 18 league matches left the team 20th in the league table.

===PEC Zwolle===

On 28 December 2018, Stam was appointed as the new manager of Eredivisie club PEC Zwolle on a year-and-a-half contract.

===Feyenoord===
On 6 March 2019, Feyenoord announced that Stam would succeed Giovanni van Bronckhorst as Feyenoord&#x27;s new manager. He signed a two-year contract, effective 1 June 2019. Following a 0–4 defeat to Ajax, Stam resigned on 28 October 2019, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve thought about this for a long time. My final conclusion is that it&#x27;s better for the club, the players and myself if I step aside.&quot;

===FC Cincinnati===

On 21 May 2020, Major League Soccer club FC Cincinnati announced that Stam would succeed interim manager Yoann Damet. He signed a year-and-a-half contract. On 15 July, he won 1–0 on his debut against an Atlanta United FC side managed by his former international teammate Frank de Boer.

Stam was dismissed on 27 September 2021, with Cincinnati second-from-bottom in the Eastern Conference having won four of 25 games.

===DOS Kampen===
In February 2024, Stam was appointed manager at seventh-tier DOS Kampen, his hometown amateur club where he had begun playing more than three decades earlier. He agreed to take charge in the summer, for a one-year contract.

==Personal life==
Stam is a Protestant. He met his wife Ellis when he was 16, and they have two daughters and twin sons. His first daughter&#x27;s birth was induced two weeks early, to come between the 1998 World Cup and pre-season training for Manchester United. When he played for Manchester United, he lived in Wilmslow in Cheshire. His cousin Maurice van Ham was also a professional footballer.

<text>Robert Fiske Bradford (December 15, 1902 – March 18, 1983) was an American lawyer and politician who served one term as the 57th governor of Massachusetts, from 1947 to 1949.

==Early years==
Robert Fiske Bradford was born in Boston, Massachusetts to Edward and Edith (Fiske) Bradford. His father was from an old traditional New England Yankee Brahmin family, a successful physician, and dean of Harvard Medical School, and his mother was the founder of the private Fiske School in Boston. Through an entirely paternal line he was a descendant of &quot;Mayflower&quot; passenger William Bradford, Governor of the Plymouth Colony in the 17th century. Bradford attended the Browne and Nichols School, and graduated from Harvard College in 1923. While at Harvard, Bradford was on the varsity crew team, and served as editor of &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;. In 1926 he received his law degree from Harvard Law School, was admitted to the bar, and began to practice law in Boston at Ropes &amp; Gray. That same year he married Rebecca Crowninshield Browne; the couple had four children.

==Political career==

A Republican, Bradford entered politics by serving as executive secretary to Governor Joseph Ely, a conservative Democrat with whom he served as an associate at Ropes &amp; Gray. After Ely left office in 1935, the two founded a law firm. He later worked on the gubernatorial and senatorial campaigns of Leverett Saltonstall, with whom he formed a close friendship. In 1938, he made his first bid for elective office by challenging Republican incumbent Warren L. Bishop in the race for District Attorney of Middlesex County. He defeated Bishop and served in that position from 1939 to 1945. In this post he gained a reputation for cracking down on corruption; his convictions included mayors of Lowell and Cambridge, and a state public works commissioner.

In 1944 he won election as lieutenant governor, serving under Democratic governor Maurice J. Tobin. In 1946, Bradford challenged and defeated Tobin, and served one term as governor, from 1947 to 1949. In the contest, Bradford was supported by Democrat James Michael Curley, who was contesting with Tobin for control of the state Democratic party apparatus. As governor, Bradford governed in the fashion of his mentor, Leverett Saltonstall, with an emphasis on fiscal conservatism and social liberalism. During his administration, he advanced balanced budgets and intervened to prevent protracted strikes, which would be deleterious to the interests of business and the broader public. His administration worked to promote public housing for veterans and prevent alcoholism through treatment and prevention programs. In 1947, he chaired the &quot;Silent Guest&quot; program in which Americans were encouraged to donate the cash equivalent of one setting of Thanksgiving dinner to the starving poor in post-war Europe. He also introduced a master plan for improving the state&#x27;s roadways, and enacted legislation to greatly expand the state&#x27;s agricultural school in Amherst, which was renamed University of Massachusetts, Amherst. The funding plan for the highway plan involved the floating of bond, and was rejected by the Democratic-controlled legislature but approved under his successor, Democrat Paul A. Dever. Bradford was defeated in his bid for re-election in 1948 by Dever, a former Massachusetts Attorney General, in a Democratic landslide.

==After politics==
After leaving office, Bradford returned to the private practice of law. He was also involved in charitable, philanthropic, and educational organizations, serving as President of Planned Parenthood of Massachusetts, on the boards of Harvard and Simmons Colleges, and on the board of Massachusetts Eye and Ear. He served as senior warden for the congregation at Boston&#x27;s King&#x27;s Chapel. He suffered for many years from Parkinson&#x27;s disease, but maintained a busy schedule despite its limitations.

Composer Leroy Anderson, who wrote such classics as &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot; and &quot;Blue Tango&quot;, wrote a piece entitled &quot;Governor Bradford March&quot;. It was premiered on July 6, 1948, in a concert by the Boston Pops Orchestra under the direction of Arthur Fiedler, at which Governor Bradford made a special appearance.

He died on March 18, 1983, in Boston, Massachusetts, and was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Magnolia Avenue, Lot 3112.

==Family and legacy==
Bradford&#x27;s daughter, Ann, was the wife of U.S. senator Charles Mathias of Maryland.

In 1996, the John F. Kennedy School of Government began offering the Governor Robert F. Bradford Fellowship, a scholarship to qualified state employees that covers both tuition and salary while the recipient attends the school. Bradford&#x27;s papers are archived at the Massachusetts Historical Society.

<doc id="754214" wikidata="Q4520798" url="?curid=754214" title="Shasta River">
<text>The Shasta River is a tributary of the Klamath River, approximately long, in northern California in the United States. It drains the Shasta Valley on the west and north sides of Mount Shasta in the Cascade Range.

The river rises in southern Siskiyou County on the edge of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, approximately southwest of Weed. It flows generally northwest through the Shasta Valley, past Weed, through Lake Shastina, and past Montague. It joins the Klamath from the south approximately north-northeast of Yreka.

The Shasta Valley is dominated by nearby Mount Shasta and underlain with volcanic basalt from eruptions of the mountain in recent geologic time. Pluto&#x27;s Cave is an example of voids remaining after highly fluid lava drained from underground conduits which were fed by volcanic vents to the east. The Shasta Valley is covered with small hillocks extending from the base of Mt. Shasta north to just beyond the city of Montague, that are the debris from the liquefication of the ancestral Mount Shasta sometime within the past 400,000 years.

==Course==
Rising on the east slope of Mount Eddy several miles west of Mount Shasta and about northwest of Shasta Lake, the Shasta River immediately proceeds to flow through a wide agricultural valley. Running north, parallel to Interstate 5, for the next few miles, the Shasta receives its first important tributary, Eddy Creek, from the left, from the mouth. It then crosses under the interstate, winds past a ridge, and passes the town of Weed. It then turns northeast into Lake Shastina, an artificial lake formed by a dam at its north end, and turns northwest.

Bypassing Big Springs from the mouth, the river picks up more agricultural runoff as it meanders north between irrigated fields. The river then passes between Yreka and Montague, from the mouth, crossed by California State Route 3 and Interstate 5 for the final time. It then enters a canyon in the Klamath Mountains, from the mouth, and begins to parallel California State Route 263. Its mouth is on the left bank of the Klamath River, at the junction of State Route 263 and State Route 96.

==Watershed==
The roughly watershed of the Shasta River consists of a semi-arid farming valley entirely in Siskiyou County. It is adjacent to the Scott River on the west, Butte Creek on the east, and the main Klamath River on the north. The watershed is located east of the Klamath Mountains and northwest of Mount Shasta. Some towns in the watershed include Weed, Edgewood, Gazelle, Big Springs, Grenada, Montague, and Yreka. Major bodies of water include Lake Shastina (Dwinnell Reservoir) and Trout Lake.

Receiving just of rain yearly on average, the -wide Shasta River Valley receives most of its surface water flow from groundwater, and now, agricultural return flows. It also receives some water from snow runoff at Mount Shasta - which flows out of lava tubes as springs and feeds east-side Shasta River tributaries such as Big Springs Creek.

==Natural History==

The Shasta River is spawning site for a run of endangered Chinook salmon. Estimates suggest that 80,000 adults fish once returned to the river every year, the largest returning population of any tributary in the Klamath watershed besides the Trinity River

Today, less than 10% of this population still returns, and recent droughts have severely hampered survival rates of juvenile fish.

The river also supports coho salmon and steelhead.

Baldwin later published the science fiction webcomics &quot;Spacetrawler&quot; and &quot;One Way&quot;. Apart from comics, Baldwin also wrote the 2003 novel &quot;Loved into Submission: a Dark Existential Farce&quot;.

<text>The Wawel Dragon (), also known as the Dragon of Wawel Hill, is a famous dragon in Polish legend.

According to the earliest account (13th century), a dragon (, &quot;one who swallows whole&quot;) plagued the capital city of Kraków established by legendary King Krak (or Krakus, Gracchus, etc.). The man-eating monster was being appeased with a weekly ration of cattle, until finally being defeated by the king&#x27;s sons using decoy cows stuffed with sulfur. But the younger prince (&quot;Krak the younger&quot; or &quot;Krak junior&quot;) murdered his elder brother to take sole credit, and was banished afterwards. Consequently Princess Wanda had to succeed the kingdom. Later in a 15th-century chronicle, the prince-names were swapped, with the elder as &quot;Krak junior&quot; and the younger as Lech. It also credited the king himself with masterminding the carcasses full of sulfur and other reagents. A yet later chronicler (Marcin Bielski, 1597) credited the stratagem to a cobbler named Skub (Skuba), adding that the &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Cave&quot; () lay beneath Wawel Castle (on Wawel Hill on the bank of the Vistula River).

== Literary history ==
The oldest known telling of the story comes from the 13th-century work attributed to Bishop of Kraków and historian of Poland, Wincenty Kadłubek.

=== Polish Chronicle (13th c.) ===
According to Wincenty Kadłubek&#x27;s &quot;Polish Chronicle&quot;, a dragon appeared during the reign of King Krak (, &quot;&quot; ).

St. Wincenty&#x27;s original Latin text actually refers to the dragon as &quot;&quot;&#x27; (Polish gloss: ; &quot;one who swallows whole&quot;), which was a neologism he had coined. In Polish translation of the work, the monster is rendered as the &quot;greedily swallowing dragon&quot; ().

It was a &quot;terrible and cruel beast&quot; dwelling &quot;in the depths [windings/curves] of a certain rock (&quot;&quot;)&quot; or emended to &quot;a certain cave ()&quot; according to Wincenty.

The dragon required a weekly offering of cattle, or else humans would have been devoured instead. In the hope of killing the dragon, Krak called upon his two sons. They could not, however, defeat the creature by hand, so they came up with a trick. They fed him a cattle skin stuffed with smoldering sulfur, causing his fiery death. After the success, the younger prince (referred to as the &quot;junior Gracchus&quot;; var. , i.e. Krak II; ) kills his elder brother blaming the dragon for the death. But his crime was soon revealed, and he got expelled from the country. Afterwards Princess Wanda had to accede to the kingship.

=== Derivative chronicles ===
Among later chronicles derived from Wincenty Kadłubek&#x27;s work, &quot;Chronicle of Greater Poland&quot; (&lt;1296) fails to make mention of the dragon at all, while the (or &quot;Mierzwa Chronicle&quot;; &quot;Kronika Dzierzwy&quot;/&quot;Kronika Mierzwy&quot;, 14th century) followed closely after Wincenty. Both these chronicles maintain that Krak, Jr. is the younger prince, and keep the elder brother nameless.

Jan Długosz&#x27;s 15th-century chronicle, however, swapped the roles of the princes, claiming that the younger son named Lech was the killer, while the elder son named Krak, Jr. became the victim. The idea for the scheme to slay the dragon (&quot;olophagus&quot;) is credited to King Krak himself, not his sons, because the king fears a mass exodus from the city may take place, and he orders to have the carcass stuffed with flammable substances, namely sulfur, tinder (; ), wax, pitch, and tar and set them on fire. The dragon ate the burning meal and died breathing fire just before death. Długosz also adds the detail that the dragon lived in a cave of Mount Wawel upon which King Krak had built his castle. In any case, the fratricide is banished, so their sister Princess Wanda must accede to the throne.

== Shoemaker version ==

Later, Marcin Bielski&#x27;s &quot;Kronika Polska&quot; (1597) gave credit to or Skuba the Cobbler () for designing the plan to defeat the dragon. The story still takes place in Kraków during the reign of King Krak, the city&#x27;s legendary founder, who is here called &quot;Krok&quot;. The dragon required a diet of three calves (&quot;cielęta&quot;) or rams (&quot;barany&quot;), something in threes, and would snatch people to sate his hunger. On Skub&#x27;s advice, King Krok had a calf&#x27;s skin filled with sulfur, used as bait to the dragon. The dragon was unable to swallow this, and drank water until it died. Afterwards, the shoemaker was rewarded handsomely. Bielski adds, &quot;One can still see his cave under the castle. It is called the Dragon&#x27;s Cave (&quot;Smocza Jama&quot;)&quot;.

=== Popular retellings ===
The most popular, fairytale version of the Wawel Dragon tale takes place in Kraków during the reign of King Krakus, the city&#x27;s legendary founder. Each day the evil dragon would beat a path of destruction across the countryside, killing the civilians, pillaging their homes, and devouring their livestock. In many versions of the story, the dragon especially enjoyed eating young maidens.
Great warriors from near and far fought for the prize and failed. A cobbler&#x27;s apprentice (named Skuba) accepted the challenge. He stuffed a lamb with sulphur and set it outside the dragon&#x27;s cave. The dragon ate it and became so thirsty, it turned to the Vistula River and drank until it burst. The cobbler married the King&#x27;s daughter as promised, and founded the city of Kraków.

==== Dratewka ====
It has also been claimed that the name of the shoemaker is Dratewka in children&#x27;s literature or storytelling about the Krak legend. However, &quot;Shoemaker Dratewka&quot; () or the &quot;Twine the Shoemaker&quot; is the name of the &quot;smok&quot;-slaying protagonist in Maria Kownacka&#x27;s play &quot;O straszliwym smoku i dzielnym szewczyku, prześlicznej królewnie i królu Gwoździku&quot; (&quot;The terrible Dragon, the brave Shoemaker, the beautiful Princess and King Gwoździk&quot;, 1935). The hero of the same name () also appears in fairy tales by .

== Origin theories ==

;Parallels
Legends of the Wawel dragon have similarities with the biblical story about Daniel and the Babylonian dragon, and in fact, it was stated in the tract from the Dzierzwa/Mierzwa Chronicle that &quot;Krak[us]&#x27;s sons killed the local dragon, like Daniel killed the dragon of Babylon&quot;.

The tale of Alexander the Great&#x27;s dragon-slaying using sulfur in the Romances on King Alexander (which episode only survived in the Syriac version, 7th century), bear an even closer resemblance.

;Ancient myth

The legend of the Kraków dragon may well have ancient, pre-Christian origins. An allusion to the practice of Human sacrifice as part of an older, unknown myth has been suggested by historian . Or perhaps an Indo-European myth of good vs. evil may underlie the legend. The Kraków Dragon may well be interpreted as a symbol of evil has been commented by others

;Historical bases
There might also be some echoes of historical events. According to some historians, the dragon is a symbol of the presence of the Avars on Wawel Hill in the second half of the sixth century, and the victims devoured by the beast symbolize the tribute levied by them. The dragon may have represented the historical Bolesław II who was responsible for the martyrdom of St. Stanislaus of Szczepanów, bishop of Kraków, according to historian .

These ideas combined (the mythos may have been overlaid with a historical allegory) has also been described. The legend may be based on an Indo-European ur-myth about a thunder deity vanquishing a great serpent, and the serpent myth was possibly conflated with the cult of St. Stanislaus.

== Monuments ==
The Wawel dragon&#x27;s supposed Dragon&#x27;s Cave (&quot;Smocza Jama&quot;) below Wawel Castle still exists, on the property on the edge of the Vistula River, and can be visited. This particular cave was purportedly first described , i.e., in the first account of the legend by Wincenty, though the chronicler merely stated that the beast resided in a &quot;winding of a rock ()&quot;, i.e. &quot; a cave ()&quot;.

A metal sculpture of the Wawel Dragon, designed in 1969 by Bronisław Chromy, was placed in front of the Dragon&#x27;s Cave (Dragon&#x27;s Den) in 1972. The dragon has seven heads, but frequently people think that it has one head and six forelegs. To the amusement of onlookers, it noisily breathes fire every few minutes, thanks to a natural gas nozzle installed in the sculpture&#x27;s mouth.
The Wawel Cathedral features a plaque commemorating the dragon&#x27;s defeat by Krakus, a Polish prince who, according to the plaque, founded the city and built his palace over the slain dragon&#x27;s cave.In front of the entrance to the cathedral, there are bones of whales or Pleistocene creatures hanging on a chain, which were found and carried to the cathedral in medieval times as the remains of a dragon. It is believed that the world will come to its end when the bones will fall on the ground. The street leading along the banks of the river leading towards the castle is &quot;ulica Smocza&quot;, which translates as &quot;Dragon Street&quot;.

== Dragon in culture ==
* Wawel Dragons (Gold, Silver, Bronze Grand Prix Dragons and Dragon of Dragons Special Prize) are awards, usually presented at Kraków Film Festival in Poland
* The Dragon (as &quot;The Beast of Kraków&quot;) appeared in the eighth issue of a comic book series Nextwave from Marvel Comics (written by Warren Ellis and drawn by Stuart Immonen).
* The Dragon appears in a series of shorts produced and published by Polish company Allegro. The shorts re-visit classic Polish legends and folk tales in modernised form: in the first short, titled &quot;Smok&quot;, the dragon is presented as a flying machine used by a mysterious outlaw to capture Kraków girls.
* Wawel Dragon is also one of main characters in Stanisław Pagaczewski&#x27;s series of books about a scientist Baltazar Gąbka, as well as short animations based on them.
* An archosaur discovered in Lisowice in 2011 was named &quot;Smok wawelski&quot; after the dragon.
* The Dragon was the mascot of popular Polish radio station RMF FM, and featured in its logo between its launch in 1990 and 2010. It was dubbed &quot;Matilda&quot;, in honor of the daughter of one of the station&#x27;s first journalists.
* Andrzej Sapkowski&#x27;s &quot;The Witcher&quot; story &quot;The Bounds of Reason&quot; begins with a cobbler attempting to slay a dragon by using a sulfur-filled lamb. Unlike in the Wawel Dragon myth, this attempt injures the creature but does not kill it.

<doc id="754224" wikidata="Q7443842" url="?curid=754224" title="Secondary education in Denmark">
<text>[[Secondary education]] in [[Denmark]] (in Danish: &quot;ungdomsuddannelse&quot;, &quot;youth education&quot;) usually takes two to four years and is attended by students between the ages of 15 and 19, after finish primary education by 9th or 10th grade. Secondary education is not compulsory, but usually free of charge, and students have a wide range of programmes to choose from. Some education programmes are oriented towards higher education, the most common being the &quot;Gymnasium&quot;. Others are more practically orientated, training students for jobs such as artisans or clerks through a combination of instruction in vocational schools and apprenticeship.

== Gymnasium ==

The Gymnasium has its origin in the cathedral and monastery schools established by the Roman Catholic Church in the early Middle Ages, and seven of the schools established in the 12th and 13th centuries still exist today. The medieval schools had, broadly speaking, only one purpose: to educate the servants of the Catholic Church by teaching them to read, write, and speak Latin and Greek. After the Reformation&#x27;s official implementation in 1536, the schools were taken over by the Crown; their primary purpose remained preparing students for theological studies, only now it was for the benefit of the Protestant Church.

This educational base remained nearly unchanged until 1809, when the old Clergyman&#x27;s School was transformed, in accordance with the spirit of the time, into a humanistic Civil Servant&#x27;s School, the purpose of which was to &quot;foster true humanity&quot; through immersion in the ancient Greek and Latin cultures combined with some teaching of natural science and modern languages.

In 1871, the scientific and technical development of the 19th century led to a division of the education curriculum into two lines: the languages and the mathematics-science line. This division remained the backbone of the structure of the Gymnasium until the year 2005, when a major reform of the Gymnasium was enacted. Today, each Gymnasium offers a selection of lines decided by each individual Gymnasium. These typically include various linguistic, scientific, and creative lines, as well as combined-subject lines.

In 1903, the languages line was divided into a classical line, preserving extensive teaching in Latin and Greek, and a modern languages line, in which Latin and Greek were replaced by English, German, and French. At the same time, the three-year course of the Gymnasium was directly connected with the municipal school through the establishment of the &quot;mellemskole&quot; (&quot;middle school&quot;, grades 6–9), later to be replaced by the &quot;realskole&quot;.

According to the latest reform, the Gymnasium still offers three years of general upper secondary education in two lines. The division of the two lines into three branches each has however been replaced by a more flexible system, under which each of the lines contains a core curriculum of obligatory subjects and a number of optional subjects which can be taken at two levels.

== Higher Preparatory Examination ==

The Higher Preparatory Examination (HF) was introduced in 1967 in a political climate that was characterised by a desire to extend educational possibilities to new groups in society. Originally, it was the idea to create a two-year course aimed specifically at prospective candidates for teacher training. There was however a concern that this concept might result in an educational cul-de-sac. So the course design was changed into an alternative route to further and higher education.

The students that were entering the new HF-programmes were mainly adults. But from the start, the HF also appealed to young people who for social or personal reasons had not followed the straight route via the Gymnasium to higher education.

The HF is thus the &quot;sweeper&quot; of the general upper secondary education level. In the Gymnasium, there is still an overrepresentation of middle class children (40% male/60% female), whereas the HF recruits its predominantly female students from a broader base of society (30% male/70% female).

== Higher Commercial Examination Programme ==
The Higher Commercial Examination Programme (HHX) started in 1888 on a private initiative at Niels Brock&#x27;s Business College in Copenhagen with a structure, which can mostly be found in the course today. The range of subjects comprised both commercial and general subjects.

In 1920, the Rigsdag (the parliament of the time) adopted the first business college act, which i.a. entitled the Niels Brock Business College to call itself a &quot;higher business school&quot;. This act introduced supervision of the activities of the business colleges, and the HHX became a State-controlled examination. In 1927, the first ministerial orders were issued regarding the content of the teaching which in all essentials dealt with the existing teaching.

The course was managed by the Ministry of Trade until 1965, when the responsibility was transferred to the Ministry of Educacion.

The HHX did not originally qualify for admission to universities and other higher education institutions in the university sector. The universities did not consider the general part of the programme sufficient. It was not until 1972, that the HHX was given the status of a university entrance examination in connection with a revision of the content, along with the introduction of more rigorous admission requirements. At the beginning of the 1970s, about half of the Danish business colleges offered the programme. By 1982, the course was offered at all Danish business.

== Higher Technical Examination Programme ==

The Higher Technical Examination Programme (HTX) was established on an experimental basis in 1982. The reason for its establishment was a desire to contribute to a broader supply of education and training possibilities following the EFG-basic courses and a desire to create a new and relevant way of access to higher education in the technical area. In this context, it was of importance that fewer and fewer skilled workers continued at the engineering colleges, whereas the number of general upper secondary graduates increased significantly.

Another reason for establishing the HTX-programme on an experimental basis was the need to strengthen the status of the technical schools. Broad education and training possibilities at the schools were to provide a broader and qualitatively better recruitment.

In 1982, the HTX-experiment was carried out at the technical schools in Sønderborg, Aalborg, and Copenhagen. The pilot period lasted until the spring of 1988, after which the programme was evaluated and made permanent after minor adjustments had been made to the individual subjects. On the same occasion, the HTX-examination was granted the status of a university entrance examination, and the graduates were now in principle placed on an equal footing with those of the Gymnasium, the HF and the HHX programmes as far as access to higher education was concerned.

== Comparison of the three main Secondary Educations ==

=== Studentereksamen: The Danish General Upper Secondary School Leaving Certificate ===
* (STX) General Upper Secondary Education – The General Upper Secondary Examination: The STX-education accomplishes subjects within arts, social and natural science.
* (HTX) General Upper Secondary Education – The Higher Technical Examination: The HTX-education accomplishes subjects within the areas of technological- and natural science in combination with general subjects.
* (HHX) General Upper Secondary Education – The Higher Commercial Examination: The HHX-education accomplishes subjects within mercantile, international and vocational formation perspectives.

The upper secondary courses are at three levels: level C (1 year), level B (2 years) and level A (3 years), of which the following subjects are compulsories:
* *&quot;Technical Science&quot; includes one of the following four courses: Building &amp; Energy, Development &amp; Production, Digital Design &amp; Development and Process, Food Technology &amp; Health
* *&quot;Culture Science&quot; includes one of the following five courses: Design &amp; Architecture, Drama, Media Studies, Music and Visual Arts
* *&quot;Natural Sciences&quot; includes two of the following four courses: Biology, Chemistry, Information Technology and Natural Geography

=== Vocational secondary education ===

This section deals with the vocational education and training and basic social and health education programmes.

Apprenticeship training in a well-organised form originates in the guilds of the Middle Ages. Each trade had its own guild in each town. The guilds fixed the duration of the training of apprentices, their wages and working conditions and the disciplines they were to learn. It was furthermore the guilds which held the journeymen&#x27;s tests.

=== Basic social and health education ===
The basic social and health education programmes (SOSU) were introduced in 1991, and the basic education programme for educator assistants was introduced in 1997. These programmes form part of the vocational upper secondary education system in Denmark.
