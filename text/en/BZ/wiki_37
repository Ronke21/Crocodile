<text>Badiraguato is a small city and seat of the Badiraguato Municipality in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. It stands at .

According to 2010 census, the city reported 3,725 inhabitants. The hamlet of &quot;La Tuna&quot;, located 110 kilometres to the North of the city, is the birthplace of Joaquín &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzmán, for a long time one of Mexico&#x27;s most powerful drug lords.

Badiraguato is located near the municipality of Culiacán. The Sierra Madre Occidental cross Badiragua and provide temperate forest ecosystems in parts of the municipality.

==Etymology==
The origin of the word Badiraguato is composed of the Cáhita-Tarascos terms: ba, &quot;dira&quot;; huato, a hybridism; whose roots are as follows: the Cáhita word ba, &quot;water&quot;, &quot;stream or river&quot;; and the Tarascos root dira, &quot;many&quot;, and huata or huato, hill; which literally means &quot;stream of many hills&quot;, this can be interpreted, in a more concrete way, as &quot;the stream of the mountains&quot;.

In pre-Hispanic times, the toponymy was applied to a stream because it accurately refers to the flow of Badiraguato (also known as Río Chico), which springs from the Sierra de Los Parra or Surutato and also gave its name to the town with signs established on its banks where it passes to join in the foothills of the mountain range in front of the disappeared town of Alicama.

The municipality of Badiraguato was created by decree published in the official newspaper of the state on April 8, 1915.

== History ==

In the seventeenth century, Jesuit missionaries founded San Juan de Badiraguato.

==Recent events==
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) was widely criticized for meeting Consuela Loera, aged 92 at the time, and mother of convicted drug lord Joaquín &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzmán, in Badiraguato during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. Loera gave AMLO a letter asking that her son be repatriated to Mexico. Lopez Obrador said,

&quot;She is a 92-year-old lady and I already said, the fatal plague is corruption, not an older adult who deserves all my respect, regardless of who her son is. And I would keep doing it. Sometimes I have to shake hands, because that is my job, to white-collar criminals, who have not even lost their respectability. So how can I not give it to a lady?&quot;

==Climate==
Badiraguato has a varied climate, from hot and arid to snowy forests in its higher parts. Areas vary from 44.5°C, the hottest, to -9 °C degrees, the coldest.

== Notable monument ==
The largest statue of Judas Thaddaeus in the world is in Badiraguato, Sinaloa. It was inaugurated on September 26, 2023.

==Notable people from rancherias in Badiraguato Municipality==

These individuals were born and lived in rancherias also known as ranchos in Mexican Spanish which are within the Badiraguato Municipality.

<text>The Walsh Act is a piece of legislation in the U.S. state of New Jersey that permits municipalities to adopt a non-partisan commission form of government. The legislation was signed by Governor of New Jersey Woodrow Wilson on April 25, 1911. The commissions in Walsh Act municipalities are composed of either three or five members elected for four-year concurrent terms. The commissioners also serve as department heads in addition to their legislative functions. The commissioners elect one commissioner as mayor, who serves as chair of the commission. With few exceptions, Walsh Act mayors have no powers over and above their fellow commissioners, and are only responsible for their specific department(s).

The Walsh Act was modeled on the commission system that was set up in Galveston, Texas, in the wake of the devastating hurricane of 1900. As part of its reconstruction efforts, the city reorganized itself to a government system in which each elected official had a specific area of responsibility, combining executive and legislative responsibilities. The Walsh Act was enacted in 1911, and specified that commissioners would be elected at large in nonpartisan elections, and would serve four-year, concurrent terms of office. The Walsh Act was the first charter law in New Jersey to include options for ballot initiatives, referendums and recall.

The popularity of the Walsh Act form of government declined from a peak of about 60 in the early years after it was created to a total of approximately 30 statewide in 2018, of which six in North Jersey and the remainder are largely in Jersey Shore communities.

==Municipalities with a five member commission==

These communities have five commissioners: 
*Commissioner of Public Affairs

<text>Concordia is a city and its surrounding municipality in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. The town is noted for manufacture of artesinal wooden furniture, symbolized by the giant chair in the town plaza. According to 2010 census, it had a population of 8,328 inhabitants.

Founded as Villa de San Sebastián in 1565 by Francisco de Ibarra, Concordia was originally a center of gold, silver and copper mining. The main church, San Sebastián, was built in 1785 with an ornate baroque facade.

Concordia is about an hour&#x27;s travel southeast of Mazatlán, on the highway to Durango. It stands at .

Residents of San Jerónimo de El Verde, located from Concordia, protested against water shortages in February 2021. Felipe Garzón López, mayor of Concordia, (PRI) blamed population increases and the drying of artisanal wells in El Palmito, Pastoría, Malpica, Amboscada, Huajote, Agua Caliente de Garate, Guásima and El Verde for water shortages. He said the solution is connection to the Picachos Dam and reservoir, as promised by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador in December 2020.

As of February 21, 2021, Concordia has reported 80 infections and 27 deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico that began in March 2020.

<doc id="735961" wikidata="Q3459521" url="?curid=735961" title="SGI Fuel">
<text>The SGI Fuel is a mid-range workstation developed and manufactured by Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI). It was introduced in January 2002, with a list price of US$11,495. Together with the entire MIPS platform, general availability for the Fuel ended on December 29, 2006. An equivalent product for the same market segment was not provided until 2008, when the Virtu product line was introduced, based on x86 microprocessors and Nvidia graphics.

The Fuel is sometimes perceived as the successor to the SGI O2, but it is not (SGI never made a new low-end system after O2). The Fuel was SGI&#x27;s mid-range response to customers who only wanted a uniprocessor system, though the 4 GB RAM limit led to fewer sales than would otherwise have been the case, e.g. customers using ANSYS would have preferred at least 8 GB maximum RAM. Fuel&#x27;s larger sibling is the SGI Tezro, a system that can have up to four 1 GHz R16000 CPUs with 16 MB L2 each. Both Fuel and Tezro are based on SGI&#x27;s Origin 3000 architecture.

== Architecture ==

The Fuel is based on the same architecture as the high-end Origin 3000 server. It is essentially a single node, single processor Origin 3000, sharing many of the same features and components.

=== Processors ===

The Fuel features either a R14000 or a R16000 microprocessor. The R14000 is clocked at 500 or 600 MHz, and is accompanied by a 2 or 4 MB L2 cache respectively. The R16000 is clocked at 700, 800 or 900 MHz and is accompanied by a 4 MB L2 cache, except for the 900 MHz variant, which has an 8 MB L2 cache. The speed of the L2 cache is clocked at half the speed of the microprocessor, e.g. 250 MHz with the 500 MHz R14000. The 900 MHz R16000 is extremely rare, perhaps due to SGI&#x27;s lack of promotion when it was introduced. While the speeds for these processors may seem low for the time, benchmarks show that for certain specialized tasks that involve small data sets, a Fuel with a 700 MHz R16000 can be equivalent to a 3.0 GHz Pentium 4 (e.g. C-Ray).

The 700 MHz R16000 became available on January 9, 2003.

=== Memory ===

The Fuel includes 512 MB of memory as standard. Using proprietary DDR SDRAM DIMMs, it can be upgraded to a maximum of 4 GB via four slots in two banks.

=== Graphics ===

The Fuel ships with two alternative VPro graphics options, the V10 and V12. V10 has 32 MB combined memory, V12 has 128 MB combined memory. In both cases, memory that is not being used for display is available for use as texture memory. The V12 supports high quality 48-bit RGBA imaging and both options support hardware-accelerated 2D imaging using the OpenGL ARB extensions (real-time rotation, zoom, pan, feature adjustments). The mplayer application uses the 3D graphics hardware to accelerate movie playback, giving good support for DivX, MPEG4 and other formats.

=== Audio ===

In its standard configuration, the Fuel does not come with any audio hardware, although speakers may be attached via a Universal Serial Bus sound card. The most common solution to add audio capabilities is to install a M-Audio Revolution 7.1 PCI sound card, although the Sound Blaster Audigy 2 ZS can also be used. Additional audio options using PCI expansion cards are available.

=== Expansion ===

The Fuel has four 64-bit 3.3V PCI slots for expansion, two of which run at 33 MHz and two of which run at 66 MHz. The system also has two internal Ultra160 SCSI busses, with space for two internal 5.25&quot; devices and three internal hard disks. The Fuel usually shipped with 10,000 rpm SCSI disks, but it can take good advantage of 15,000 rpm models, with sustained bandwidths up to three times faster than is possible with Octane2&#x27;s internal UW bus. The Fuel was also the first SGI system to support USB devices in IRIX, although audio and HID USB devices were the only ones supported.

== Operating System ==
The SGI Fuel is only officially capable of running SGI&#x27;s IRIX operating system. Support begins with IRIX version 6.5.17.

<text>Cosalá () is a small city and the seat of its surrounding municipality in the Mexican 
state of Sinaloa. It stands at 

The city reported 6,577 inhabitants in the 2010 census.

==Overview==
The Royal of the Eleven Thousand Virgins, shortened its name to the Royal Mines of Cosalá is the municipal seat.

Francisco Iriarte y Conde, governor of Occidente State declared Cosalá the capital of the western state in 1826. This was due to the growing threat of attack on the former capital El Fuerte, Sinaloa by the forces of Juan Banderas, leader of the Yaqui at that point in the Yaqui Wars.

Iriarte introduced printing in Sonora and Sinaloa and it was in Cosalá that the first newspaper of Sinaloa, &quot;The Impartial Spectator&quot; was published.

In its surroundings are attractions such as the Vado Hondo waterfall and town reservoirs &quot;Comedero&quot; and &quot;El Salto&quot; a few miles from town. Both these lakes are stocked with largemouth bass. The Museum of Mineralogy mainly displays photographs and documents on the history of mining in Sinaloa.

Cosalá was the dominant region in the social and political life of the State of Sinaloa until it became its capital in the early independent Mexico.

== Geography ==

Cosalá is located 155 km. from state capital Culiacán.

=== Climate ===

Cosalá is classified as having a Köppen Tropical Wet and Dry climate (Aw) despite being situated about 1 degree above the Tropic of Cancer. Most municipalities to the north of Cosalá, such as Culiacán, have semi-arid to arid climates, as one moves towards the Sonoran–Sinaloan transition subtropical dry forest, and into the Sonoran Desert.

Cosalá experiences much greater diurnal temperature variations than most Tropical Wet and Dry climates, especially during the winter months, where temperatures regularly drop as low as 10C in January and February (compare this to Mazatlán, located about 1 degree south, inside the Tropic of Cancer, where nighttime temperatures in January and February are about 15C on average). Daytime temperatures also tend to be hotter than most locations further south (highs approaching 37C in May/Jun, compared to 30C-33C for Mazatlán), and as such, Cosala&#x27;s climate behaves more similarly to a semi-arid climate, in this regard, than a truly tropical climate. The record low temperature of 1C, is also substantially colder than Mazatlan&#x27;s 7.5C.

== Attractions ==

*The Gruta México, a giant cave with stalactites and stalagmites
*The Santa Ursula Temple, built in the 18th century which represents the most significant church of Cosalá
*The Museum of Mining and History, unique in the country because it traces the mining history of the State with collections of:
**documents
**old photographs
**pre-Hispanic and colonial metallic objects
**mineral samples
**books 
**weapons
**carriages and horseshoes from the 18th and 19th centuries

Cosalá, Sinaloa, was named a &quot;Pueblo Mágico&quot; in 2005 for its natural environment, cultural riches, and historical relevance.

<text>Rastaman Vibration is the eighth studio album by Jamaican reggae band Bob Marley and the Wailers, released in April 1976.

==Critical reception==
Reviewing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1976, Robert Palmer said that on the album Marley consummately performs &quot;a dual role as spokesman for the Third World&#x27;s disadvantaged and avatar of a highly commercial brand of popular music&quot;. While lacking the forceful, intricate quality of the Wailers&#x27; past line-up, &quot;the sensitive, careful listener will learn from &quot;Rastaman Vibration&quot; something of the pain, rage and determination of Shantytown, Jamaica, and perhaps something of the community&#x27;s political and cultural fragmentation as well&quot;, Palmer concluded.

&quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau said if the record&#x27;s first side &quot;makes it seem that reggae has turned into the rasta word for boogie—even to a Trenchtown tragedy recited with all the toughness of an imprecation against litter—the unimpassioned sweetness of most of side two sounds like a function of reflective distance, assured in its hard-won calm. Some of it&#x27;s even better.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Rastaman Vibration&quot; was a great success in the US, becoming the first Bob Marley release to reach the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart (peaking at number eight), in addition to releasing Marley&#x27;s most popular US single &quot;Roots, Rock, Reggae&quot;, the only Marley single to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, peaking at number 51. Synthesizers are featured prominently on &quot;Rastaman Vibration&quot;, adding a breezy embellishment to otherwise hard-driving songs with strong elements of rock guitar. This is one of the three Wailers solo albums released in 1976, along with &quot;Blackheart Man&quot; by Bunny Wailer and &quot;Legalize It&quot; by Peter Tosh.

==Songwriting credits==
Although the album&#x27;s liner notes list multiple songwriters, including family friends and band members, all songs were written by Marley. Marley was involved in a contractual dispute at the time with his former publishing company, Cayman Music. Marley had not wanted his new songs to be associated with Cayman and it was speculated, including in his obituary in &quot;The Independent&quot;, that he had put them in the names of his friends and family members as a means of avoiding the contractual restrictions and to provide lasting help to family and close friends.

Vincent Ford, a childhood friend from Jamaica, is credited as the songwriter for &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot; on the 1974 album &quot;Natty Dread&quot;, as well as the songs &quot;Crazy Baldheads&quot; (with Marley&#x27;s wife Rita), &quot;Positive Vibration&quot; and &quot;Roots Rock Reggae&quot; from &quot;Rastaman Vibration&quot;, along with &quot;Inna De Red&quot; and &quot;Jah Bless&quot; with Marley&#x27;s son, Stephen.

Marley&#x27;s widow and his former manager Danny Sims sued to obtain royalty and ownership rights to the songs, claiming that Marley had actually written the songs but had assigned the credit to Ford to avoid meeting commitments made in prior contracts. A 1987 court decision favored the Marley estate, which assumed full control of the songs.

<text>In chemistry, valence bond (VB) theory is one of the two basic theories, along with molecular orbital (MO) theory, that were developed to use the methods of quantum mechanics to explain chemical bonding. It focuses on how the atomic orbitals of the dissociated atoms combine to give individual chemical bonds when a molecule is formed. In contrast, molecular orbital theory has orbitals that cover the whole molecule.

==History==
In 1916, G. N. Lewis proposed that a chemical bond forms by the interaction of two shared bonding electrons, with the representation of molecules as Lewis structures. The chemist Charles Rugeley Bury suggested in 1921 that eight and eighteen electrons in a shell form stable configurations. Bury proposed that the electron configurations in transitional elements depended upon the valence electrons in their outer shell. In 1916, Kossel put forth his theory of the ionic chemical bond (octet rule), also independently advanced in the same year by Gilbert N. Lewis. Walther Kossel put forward a theory similar to Lewis&#x27; only his model assumed complete transfers of electrons between atoms, and was thus a model of ionic bonding. Both Lewis and Kossel structured their bonding models on that of Abegg&#x27;s rule (1904).

Although there is no mathematical formula either in chemistry or quantum mechanics for the arrangement of electrons in the atom, the hydrogen atom can be described by the Schrödinger equation and the Matrix Mechanics equation both derived in 1925. However, for hydrogen alone, in 1927 the Heitler–London theory was formulated which for the first time enabled the calculation of bonding properties of the hydrogen molecule H2 based on quantum mechanical considerations. Specifically, Walter Heitler determined how to use Schrödinger&#x27;s wave equation (1926) to show how two hydrogen atom wavefunctions join together, with plus, minus, and exchange terms, to form a covalent bond. He then called up his associate Fritz London and they worked out the details of the theory over the course of the night. Later, Linus Pauling used the pair bonding ideas of Lewis together with Heitler–London theory to develop two other key concepts in VB theory: resonance (1928) and orbital hybridization (1930). According to Charles Coulson, author of the noted 1952 book &quot;Valence&quot;, this period marks the start of &quot;modern valence bond theory&quot;, as contrasted with older valence bond theories, which are essentially electronic theories of valence couched in pre-wave-mechanical terms.

Linus Pauling published in 1931 his landmark paper on valence bond theory: &quot;On the Nature of the Chemical Bond&quot;. Building on this article, Pauling&#x27;s 1939 textbook: &quot;On the Nature of the Chemical Bond&quot; would become what some have called the bible of modern chemistry. This book helped experimental chemists to understand the impact of quantum theory on chemistry. However, the later edition in 1959 failed to adequately address the problems that appeared to be better understood by molecular orbital theory. The impact of valence theory declined during the 1960s and 1970s as molecular orbital theory grew in usefulness as it was implemented in large digital computer programs. Since the 1980s, the more difficult problems, of implementing valence bond theory into computer programs, have been solved largely, and valence bond theory has seen a resurgence.

==Theory==
According to this theory a covalent bond is formed between two atoms by the overlap of &quot;half filled valence&quot; atomic orbitals of each atom containing one unpaired electron. Valence Bond theory describes chemical bonding better than Lewis Theory, which states that atoms share or transfer electrons so that they achieve the octet rule. It does not take into account orbital interactions or bond angles, and treats all covalent bonds equally. A valence bond structure resembles a Lewis structure, but when a molecule cannot be fully represented by a single Lewis structure, multiple valence bond structures are used. Each of these VB structures represents a specific Lewis structure. This combination of valence bond structures is the main point of resonance theory. Valence bond theory considers that the overlapping atomic orbitals of the participating atoms form a chemical bond. Because of the overlapping, it is most probable that electrons should be in the bond region. Valence bond theory views bonds as weakly coupled orbitals (small overlap). Valence bond theory is typically easier to employ in ground state molecules. The core orbitals and electrons remain essentially unchanged during the formation of bonds.

The overlapping atomic orbitals can differ. The two types of overlapping orbitals are sigma and pi. Sigma bonds occur when the orbitals of two shared electrons overlap head-to-head, with the electron density most concentrated between nuclei. Pi bonds occur when two orbitals overlap when they are parallel. For example, a bond between two &quot;s&quot;-orbital electrons is a sigma bond, because two spheres are always coaxial. In terms of bond order, single bonds have one sigma bond, double bonds consist of one sigma bond and one pi bond, and triple bonds contain one sigma bond and two pi bonds. However, the atomic orbitals for bonding may be hybrids. Hybridization is a model that describes how atomic orbitals combine to form new orbitals that better match the geometry of molecules. Atomic orbitals that are similar in energy combine to make hybrid orbitals. For example, the carbon in methane (CH4) undergoes sp3 hybridization to form four equivalent orbitals, resulting in a tetrahedral shape. Different types of hybridization, such as sp, sp2, and sp3, correspond to specific molecular geometries (linear, trigonal planar, and tetrahedral), influencing the bond angles observed in molecules. Hybrid orbitals provide additional directionality to sigma bonds, accurately explaining molecular geometries.

==Comparison with MO theory==
Valence bond theory complements molecular orbital theory, which does not adhere to the valence bond idea that electron pairs are localized between two specific atoms in a molecule but that they are distributed in sets of molecular orbitals which can extend over the entire molecule. Although both theories describe chemical bonding, molecular orbital theory generally offers a clearer and more reliable framework for predicting magnetic and ionization properties. In particular, MO theory can effectively account for paramagnetism arising from unpaired electrons, whereas VBT struggles. Valence bond theory views aromatic properties of molecules as due to spin coupling of the orbitals. This is essentially still the old idea of resonance between Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz and James Dewar structures. In contrast, molecular orbital theory views aromaticity as delocalization of the -electrons. Valence bond treatments are restricted to relatively small molecules, largely due to the lack of orthogonality between valence bond orbitals and between valence bond structures, while molecular orbitals are orthogonal. Additionally, valence bond theory cannot explain electronic transitions and spectroscopic properties as effectively as MO theory. Furthermore, while VBT employs hybridization to explain bonding, it can oversimplify complex bonding situations, limiting its applicability in more intricate molecular geometries such as transition metal compounds. On the other hand, valence bond theory provides a much more accurate picture of the reorganization of electronic charge that takes place when bonds are broken and formed during the course of a chemical reaction. In particular, valence bond theory correctly predicts the dissociation of homonuclear diatomic molecules into separate atoms, while simple molecular orbital theory predicts dissociation into a mixture of atoms and ions. For example, the molecular orbital function for dihydrogen is an equal mixture of the covalent and ionic valence bond structures and so predicts incorrectly that the molecule would dissociate into an equal mixture of hydrogen atoms and hydrogen positive and negative ions.

==Computational approaches==

Modern valence bond theory replaces the overlapping atomic orbitals by overlapping valence bond orbitals that are expanded over a large number of basis functions, either centered each on one atom to give a classical valence bond picture, or centered on all atoms in the molecule. The resulting energies are more competitive with energies from calculations where electron correlation is introduced based on a Hartree–Fock reference wavefunction. The most recent text is by Shaik and Hiberty.

==Applications==

An important aspect of the valence bond theory is the condition of maximum overlap, which leads to the formation of the strongest possible bonds. This theory is used to explain the covalent bond formation in many molecules.

For example, in the case of the F2 molecule, the F−F bond is formed by the overlap of &quot;p&quot;&quot;z&quot; orbitals of the two F atoms, each containing an unpaired electron. Since the nature of the overlapping orbitals are different in H2 and F2 molecules, the bond strength and bond lengths differ between H2 and F2 molecules.

In methane (CH4), the carbon atom undergoes sp3 hybridization, allowing it to form four equivalent sigma bonds with hydrogen atoms, resulting in a tetrahedral geometry. Hybridization also explains the equal C-H bond strengths.

In an HF molecule the covalent bond is formed by the overlap of the 1&quot;s&quot; orbital of H and the 2&quot;p&quot;&quot;z&quot; orbital of F, each containing an unpaired electron. Mutual sharing of electrons between H and F results in a covalent bond in HF.

<text>Bahía Blanca (; English: &quot;White Bay&quot;) is an Argentine city by the Atlantic Ocean. By metropolitan area, it is the largest city of southwest Buenos Aires province, 4th largest in the entire province, and 17th in Argentina. It is the seat of government of the Bahía Blanca Partido, with 336,574 inhabitants according to the . Bahía Blanca is the principal city in the Greater Bahía Blanca area.

The city has an important seaport with a depth of , kept constant upstream almost all along the length of the bay, where the Napostá Stream drains.

&quot;Bahía Blanca&quot; means &quot;White Bay&quot;. The name is due to the color of the salt covering the local soil surrounding the shores. The bay (which is an estuary) was seen by Ferdinand Magellan during his first circumnavigation of the world on the order of Charles I of Spain in 1520, looking for a canal connecting the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean along the coasts of South America.

The city was founded as a fortress on 11 April 1828 by Colonel Ramón Estomba on the orders of Brigadier-General and subsequent Governor of Buenos Aires, Juan Manuel de Rosas. It was initially named &quot;Fortaleza Protectora Argentina&quot; (Argentine Protective Fortress), built for the purpose of protecting inhabitants from cattle rustlers, and also to guard the coast against the Brazilian navy, which had landed in the area the previous year. It was visited by Charles Darwin during his travels through South America in September 1833. The fortress was attacked by &quot;Malones&quot; (incursions of nomadic aboriginals on horseback) several times, most notably in 1859 by 3,000 Calfucurá warriors. It became commercially important after the Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway linked the town to the city of Buenos Aires in 1885, facilitating the transport of grain from the Pampas. 
The rapid growth of the local economy, the policy encouraging immigration from Europe, and the country&#x27;s abundant natural resources attracted many immigrants, mainly from Spain and Italy, and a remarkable number from France, who settled in Pigüé, about 125 km to the north of the city. Another important foreign settlement close to the city was of Dutch settlers, in Tres Arroyos, located about 250 km northeast. Major groups of immigrants from Germany and Jews from Eastern Europe also arrived in the city and the region at the beginning of the 20th century, as well as during World War II and the post-war period.

European immigrants brought their customs and culture. There were at least five opera houses in Bahía Blanca at the beginning of the 20th century and six cinemas by 1920. 

Puerto Belgrano, located 29 km to the southeast, is Argentina&#x27;s largest naval base. Its construction started with a secret decree signed by Argentine President José Evaristo Uriburu. It was designed and built from 12 May 1898 to 8 March 1902 by an Italian engineer Luigi Luiggi, and a Dutch company named Dirks, Dates &amp; Van Hattem (detailed in the History of Puerto Belgrano).

==Governance==
The municipal government of Bahia Blanca Partido includes the mayor, in charge of the executive branch, the city council, and the local legislation, approval and audit of the municipal budget, and a local Judiciary System, in charge of administering justice on behalf of the city regarding all the aspects of municipal legislation. The mayor and the members of the council are elected by direct vote, while the municipal judges are appointed. The mayor appoints the members of his cabinet of Secretaries who can be summoned by the council to whom they are mainly accountable.

A local political crisis in March 2006 resulted in the mayor&#x27;s request for leave, which was granted by the city council on 27 March 2006. The mayor was indicted, and the case continued in the local judiciary. The president of the city council then took over as interim mayor. However, on 24 August 2006, the city council decided, for the first time in the history of the city, to unseat the elected mayor. With the approval of the supreme court of the Buenos Aires Province, the interim mayor and former president of the city council was appointed to complete his predecessor&#x27;s term.

==Economy==
Bahía Blanca is an important trans-shipping and commercial center, handling the large export trade of grains and wool from the southern area of Buenos Aires Province, oil from Neuquén Province, and fruit from the Río Negro Valley. Its group of seaports is one of the most important in the country as the only ones that are naturally deep, although the depth of the main channel is kept at by regular maintenance. Along the northeastern shore of the bay, these ports are Puerto Ingeniero White for grains and containers, and Puerto Galván, a smaller one specialising in sunflower and soy oil, and chemicals such as urea. One of the largest urea industrial producers in the world, Profertil, is located there. Between these two main ports, several industrial and chemical plants operate their piers. The petrochemical pole of the region made the port a very convenient one. Competence between Puerto de Bahía Blanca and those located on the shores of Patagonia (subsidized by provincial governments through the National Treasury) made it stronger and very well organized having received investments from the private sector like Cargill that upgraded facilities in the 1980s. The combination of a railroad network for grains linking Rosario, Santa Fe, by the shore of Paraná River to Bahía Blanca, and its trade potential, linking also Bahía Blanca to Zapala. the availability of energy (natural gas and electricity) and human resources make the area quite an interesting one from industrial and commercial perspectives.

There are several local societies representing economic activities taking place in the region such as Sociedad Rural, Corporación del Comercio y de la Industria, and Sociedad Industrial, all of whom organize conferences and exhibits linked to the branch of trade, commerce, or industry their associates carry out. Some of the exhibits are quite traditional and have taken place for many years, such as &quot;Exposición Nacional de Ganadería e Industria de la Sociedad Rural de Bahía Blanca&quot;, mainly grouping those devoted to cattle husbandry and sheep breeding, which up to 2006 account for 122 annual displays when there is a contest awarding prizes to the best-presented animals.
As far as the retail business goes the biggest presence is the BPM store with over 300 locations in the city and more than 2500 worldwide. The very first location is still open and operated personally by the founders. It is located downtown right next to &quot;Teatro Don Bosco&quot;, this was key to their success.

==Transportation==

Bahía Blanca is served by Comandante Espora Airport (BHI/SAZB). There are two daily short-haul flights from Bahía Blanca (BHI) to the domestic flights airport in Buenos Aires (AEP). The Navy also operates a weekly flight to and from Buenos Aires, for service people who commute between the two cities. The local airport&#x27;s runways belong to the Navy Aviation (BACE, standing for Base Aeronaval Comandante Espora). There is a civilian terminal supported by the city council apart from the military one. The civilian terminal is undergoing an important renovation.

The bus terminal of the city, recently remodeled and redesigned, services the whole country. The bus transportation system has a wider range of short, medium and long-distance connections and destinations offering many overnight trips from Bahía Blanca to Buenos Aires, to hundreds of cities and towns throughout the country and also to neighbouring countries such as Uruguay.

A network of motorways merge in the city linking it to the region and the rest of the country. In recent years, different administrations have tried to create and improve an outer ring road by which traffic is facilitated avoiding unnecessary congestion allowing lorries or trucks, as well as automobiles, to directly enter and exit the port area. Vehicles passing by can also avoid entering the city via this ring road. There are also projects to improve the road link between the city and the airport. Multiple local bus lines form the city transportation system. The main route, Ruta Nacional 3, is divided there into 3 North, leading to Olavarría and Buenos Aires, and 3 South leading to Viedma, Trelew, Comodoro Rivadavia, Río Gallegos, Río Grande and Ushuaia. Other routes include National Route 35, leading to Santa Rosa and Río Cuarto, National Route 33, leading to Trenque Lauquen and Rosario, and National Route 22, which leads to Neuquén Province.

=== Railway ===

Bahía Blanca has a total of three railway stations, with no passenger services as of January 2024. The last active station was Bahía Blanca Sud, originally built by British BA Great Southern company and opened in 1884, and terminus of General Roca Railway covering the distance between Constitución and Bahía Blanca. Services to Bahía Blanca were interrupted by state-owned Trenes Argentinos in October 2022 after a derailment in Olavarría.

The other two stations of the city were built and originally operated by British Bahía Blanca and North Western Railway (opened in 1891) and French Rosario and Puerto Belgrano Railway (opened in 1912) respectively. After its closure in 1962, the FCRPB station then served as the municipal library until it was destroyed by fire in 2022.
;Note
==Architecture==

The city has the common features of those founded by the Spanish and their descendants: a main square at the centre surrounded by relevant buildings the likes of The City Hall and the Church (located on opposite although facing sides of the main square). Buildings of administrative importance also surround the main square or are located nearby. The planning which took place before its foundation and during its early development conceived streets parallel to the sides of the main square. Almost all the blocks are then rectangular in shape. As the city developed the streets were extended and more rectangular blocks were added at the edges. The Administration of the City decided then to observe a plan of development probably about 1960, when it might have been ruled that further developments would follow established criteria according to their purpose: permanent dwellers, public places, industries.
Most of the city has terraced houses although detached houses surrounded by extensive gardens are well developed in some areas such as &quot;barrio Palihue&quot;, with an adjacent golf course at Club de Golf Palihue. &quot;Barrio Patagonia&quot; and country clubs for permanent and also for week-end dwellers were designed and developed at the outskirts of the city.
The architecture of Bahía Blanca is notable as well. Public buildings such as the seat of the Banco de la Nación, Bolsa de Comercio de Bahía Blanca (Chamber of Commerce, the stock exchange), the main Post Office, the former building of the local newspaper &quot;La Nueva Provincia&quot;, the City Hall, the Rectorate and academic departments of Universidad del Sur, its &#x27;Casa de la Cultura&#x27;, Teatro Municipal (Opera House of the city), Biblioteca Rivadavia and Club Argentino, amongst others, are well-considered pieces of architecture, most of them extremely well preserved. Some of them are of French neoclassical influence (&quot;L&#x27;École des Beaux Arts&quot;, Paris).
There are excellent monuments and pieces of sculpture scattered all along the city: in the streets, main buildings and green spaces such as Caronti&#x27;s bust, facing the City Hall, the Memorial to Bernardino Rivadavia, at the centre of the main square, Fuente de los Ingleses and Memorial of the Israeli community, in the same square. The statue of José de San Martín, in Parque de Mayo, the sculpture group of Lola Mora in the fountain at the front of Universidad del Sur, the memorial to Giuseppe Garibaldi, the statue of Isabel I of Castile in front of the bus station, donated by the Government of Spain (no such pieces are donated to non capital cities as it has been this case, enhancing the importance of the local Spanish descendants), the pieces which decorate the frontispieces of Banco de la Nación, Edificio Banco Provincia, to the side of the City Hall, Saint George and the Dragon of the former electrical power plant of Ingeniero White in the Port, the ones of the former building of La Nueva Provincia and those of the cathedral are unique, as well as the modern art ones which form the group of Paseo de las Esculturas, indeed remarkable. Although not a sculpture, the mural mosaic of Colegio Don Bosco, on the corner of Vieytes and Moreno streets, by Aurelio Friedrich -a local plastic artist- is to be mentioned. All of them do enrich the architectural, artistic and cultural patrimony and heritage of the city.
Multiple green spaces have been created in the city: Plaza Rivadavia (its main square), Parque de Mayo, Paseo de las Esculturas, Parque Independencia, Plaza 9 de Julio, and Plaza Villa Mitre, are the most familiar ones.

Besides the usual areas included when the city is to be shown to somebody who is unfamiliar with it, other areas of interest include the &quot;Barrio Inglés&quot; (&#x27;English Quarter&#x27;) where the British foremen and technicians who built the railways and ports lived, and Villa Harding Green, a suburb where the railway and port managers dwelled.

==Culture and education==
The city is a developed one including cultural and educational aspects. It has a permanent Symphony Orchestra and a Company of Classical Ballet (&quot;Ballet del Sur&quot;) with an associate School of Classic Dances.
For further education there are two tertiary institutes and two national universities. The first ones are Instituto Superior Juan XXIII, (probably linked to the future UNISAL (standing for Universidad Salesiana) of the Salesians) and Instituto Avanza (tertiary institute of humanities). National Universities are Facultad Regional Bahía Blanca Universidad Tecnológica Nacional, devoted mainly to exact sciences and intended for students who do have a job for making a living, with formal activities in the evening; and the Universidad Nacional del Sur (&quot;National University of the South&quot;), founded in January 1956. This last one has associated internationally known institutes of research in biological, biochemical and technological sciences such as INIBIB and Instituto de Oceanografia, among others. Both national universities are free of tuition fees for all students. Nobel laureate César Milstein was born and raised in Bahía Blanca.
Initial and basic education depend on the Province of Buenos Aires although there is a locally elected Municipal Educational Counselor holding some degree of influence and supervision on both. The system was transformed about ten years ago through the Secretary of Education. What used to be a system with primary (mandatory) and secondary (non-mandatory) education before continuing university studies (the &#x27;French model&#x27;) became Basic General Education (mandatory) and Polimodal Education (the &#x27;Spanish-Catalan model&#x27;) although nowadays it is being reviewed and likely to be modified again. Free education is granted by the state although there are semi-private and private schools.

There are reputed provincial Schools of Plastic Arts and Music, free of tuition fees. Foreign languages are taught at public schools at a rather basic level. However, there are local foreign language schools such as the &quot;Asociación Bahiense de Cultura Inglesa&quot; (English, also taught by many other institutions), the Alliance Française (French), the Dante Alighieri Society (Italian) and Goethe-Institut (German), all of them private although with a good number of students. Portuguese is also taught. There used to be a school of Basque language at &quot;Unión Vasca&quot; also named &quot;Euzkadi&quot; with a much smaller group of students.

===Libraries===
The main public library, Biblioteca Bernardino Rivadavia, is one of the oldest in the area, possessing a curated collection of around 160,000 books, newspapers, and magazines. In addition, the library of Universidad Nacional del Sur and several smaller council-supported libraries are open to the public.

===Museums===

There are several museums in the city which include the Port Museum, the History Museum, the Fine Arts Museum and the Contemporary Arts Museum, these last two ones headed by Betiana Gerardi, where permanent and temporary exhibits take place. Pieces of art from reputed local and Argentine artists belonging to the City patrimony are shown. There are at least two known large oils on canvas by Benito Quinquela Martín, one there—at the Museum—and the other in the mayor&#x27;s office. Other exhibits do regularly take place at Biblioteca Rivadavia, Chamber of Commerce, Casa de la Cultura and Alliance Française, where frequent &quot;vernissages&quot; are organized on the responsibility of different curators. There are at least two associations of local and regional plastic artists, Asociación de Bahiense de Artistas Plásticos and Asociacion de Artistas del Sur, both of them actively promoting workshops and exhibits throughout the year, also in charge of the organization of multiple cultural activities.

A military museum organised by the Army at its local &quot;Comando del V Cuerpo de Ejército&quot; (V Army Corps Command) at which a miniaturized recreation of the original Fortress is on display, made by César Puliafito, as well as a quite interesting collection of ancient maps, documents and pieces alongside one of the most important -and rather unknown- libraries of history in the region: this one and the one of the Salesians, at Inspectoría San Francisco Javier (Head of the Salesians of Don Bosco for the whole Patagonia) have fantastic collections with many priceless documents related to the conquest and &quot;civilization&quot; of Patagonia, almost completely carried out by the Army and the Salesians. The Army Museum of History of Bahía Blanca is open to the public with guided tours being available on appointment. All museums in the city have free admission.

===Publications===
There is one local and regional newspaper, &quot;La Nueva Provincia&quot;, as well as regularly published indexed scientific journals such as Revista Científica de la Asociación Médica de Bahía Blanca &quot;(Bahía Blanca Medical Association Scientific Journal)&quot; in Spanish with abstracts in both Spanish and English. EDIUNS, the publisher of Universidad Nacional del Sur, produces what Scientists, Professors and Lecturers edit facilitating them all the processes related to publishing including copyright procedures which is beneficial for both editors and readers. CREEBBA (the Regional Center for Economic Studies of Bahía Blanca, Argentina) publishes respected, independent reports regarding financial and economical aspects of the city and its area of influence. Written in Spanish, they also comment on national macroeconomic issues.

===Shopping===

Two shopping centres are located at the outskirts of the city and many shops in the centre itself are quite active and offer a variety of first line goods and products. On weekends, mainly on Saturday there is a craftsmanship fair in the street at Plaza Rivadavia, the main square, where all kinds of handmade goods are available. There is also a variety of megastores, some of them locally and regionally developed competing with branches of international companies. Most of them are open even on Sundays, although this is now under review and local unions have lobbied for businesses and shops to close on Sundays.

===Entertainment===
Cinemas, discos, a variety of restaurants and pubs are available, many of them overnight. Frequent pieces of theatre, ballet and concerts are offered.

Bahía Blanca has also two zoos: a municipal one, with a variety of species and permanent veterinarians and personnel looking after the animals, and a private one in the outskirts of the town.
At the shores close to the city there are recreational places such as &quot;Balneario Maldonado&quot; and &quot;Colón&quot; . The Estuary has been graded and listed as The Natural Reserve of Bahía Blanca, Bahía Falsa and Bahía Verde, including the Islands Zuraitas, Bermejo, Trinidad, Embudo, Wood and smaller ones accounting for an area of 300 square kilometres, by Provincial Law 12101 effective since 1998. Fishing for sharks is becoming an attraction for an increasing number of people, some of whom travel from across the country to do it, in specified areas of the estuary where it is permitted by boat or from small piers in the islands of the bay.

===Religion===
The vast majority of the inhabitants of the city are Roman Catholics although there are Protestant churches and a synagogue. There are also Muslims in the city, but no mosque. The city is religiously tolerant, a common nationwide characteristic guaranteed by the Argentine Constitution.
The city is the seat of the Archdiocese of Bahía Blanca. Its mother church is a neoclassical cathedral (the Our Lady of Mercy Cathedral). The Archbishop since 2003 is Guillermo José Garlatti. The Archbishop presides the local branch of the relief and social assistance organization Caritas, which supports itself through the help of Catholic and non-Catholic individuals as well as non-governmental organizations.

==Sports==

Facilities for playing football, tennis, rugby, golf, indoor swimming, indoor and outdoor basketball and some other sports are easily available throughout the area.
There are two large indoor basketball stadiums with about 3000 to 3500 seats each and three important football stadiums close to the city centre, the largest one with facilities for hosting about 15,000 people. There is one golf club with three courts of 9 holes each, driving range and putting green where courtesy for visiting players is observed. Two more golf courses are available in the area, one in a country club and the other in Puerto Belgrano.
Since the 1950s, &quot;Bahía&quot; has been considered the leading city of Argentine basketball. Internationally well-known players are Emanuel Ginóbili (NBA, San Antonio Spurs, Texas), Juan Ignacio Sánchez (also an NBA player who returned home in 2010 to found a professional local basketball team: Bahia Basket) and Alejandro Montecchia. They were gold medal winners in the Olympic Games Athens 2004, and members of the Argentine Team which played the final match FIBA World Championship in Indianapolis 2002 (2° place) and the FIBA World Championship in Japan 2006 where they came in fourth. Their coach at that event was Sergio Santos Hernández, also a native of Bahía Blanca. Former players Alberto Cabrera (deceased) and Atilio Fruet (retired) are also well remembered at national and local levels.
The city&#x27;s principal football (soccer) teams are Olimpo and Villa Mitre. Olimpo played in the Argentine first division until relegation in 2006, and was reinstated in 2010. Ex-Argentina national football team coach Alfio Basile and the football players Rodrigo Palacio, and current Argentina and Internazionale Milan forward Lautaro Martínez were born in Bahía Blanca.

Two of the best &quot;padel&quot; players in history hail from Bahía Blanca: Juan Mieres and Miguel Lamperti, both currently ranked in the top 10 in the world.
==Healthcare==
The illiteracy rate of the city, as well as the neonatal and infant mortality rates, are amongst the lowest in the country. Besides the national censuses -which take place every ten years-, the Ministry of Economy carries out periodical regional censuses sampling urban areas collecting data on economic and social indexes, such as &quot;Encuesta Permanente de Hogares&quot; by INDEC. There are two principal hospitals in the city: a provincial one, Hospital Dr José Penna, and a municipal one, Hospital Municipal Dr Leónidas Lucero, both of them tertiary centres for assistance and referrals throughout the region. The health care system is free of charge to any legal resident of the Nation. Public Health is the responsibility of both the Province of Buenos Aires and the city, which have a network of public clinics throughout the city and the region taking care of people as primary health carers. There are also private health care institutions. There is one physician for every 266 inhabitants. Public health is coordinated between the Minister of Health of the Buenos Aires Province, who has a Delegate in Bahía Blanca (Zona Sanitaria I), and the City Administration under the supervision of the local Secretary of Health appointed directly by the city mayor. Aspects of interest about the City and Council Administration can be found on its website in both Spanish and English.

<text>Lanús () is the capital of Lanús Partido, Buenos Aires Province in Argentina. It lies just south of the capital city Buenos Aires, in the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area. The city has a population of 212,152 (), and the Partido de Lanús has a total population of 453,500.

==Overview==

A major industrial centre, it is served by freight and passenger railway lines. The city has chemical, armaments, textiles, paper, leather and rubber goods, wire, apparel, oils and lubricants industries, as well as tanneries, vegetable and fruit canneries. Several technical schools are located in the city, as well as the Eva Perón Medical Center, one of the largest in the Greater Buenos Aires area.

The city has a football club, Club Atlético Lanús currently playing in the Argentine Primera División. Club Atlético Lanús also has a basketball team.

Guillermo Gaebeler initiated the town&#x27;s development, designing its first city master plan. Gaebeler established the town as &quot;Villa General Paz&quot; on October 20, 1888, and named its first streets and plazas after the numerous battles won by General José María Paz in the Argentine Civil Wars of the mid-19th century. Lanús was officially renamed in 1955 in honor of Anacarsis Lanús, who owned the land where the city is today located until his death in 1887.

== History ==
Before the Spanish conquest, the land that now comprises the Partido de Lanús was inhabited by indigenous tribes, including the Pampas and Guarani. The Pampas were a group of nomadic indigenous people who lived in the vast plains that gave them their name. They survived through hunting and gathering, using tools like bows and arrows and bolls for hunting and warfare.

The Guarani people, particularly the &quot;Guaraníes de las Islas&quot; group living in the estuary of the Plata River, had a more sedentary lifestyle. They sailed in large canoes and used weapons like macanas, bows, and arrows. They were skilled weavers and potters, making pottery from cotton and other plant fibers. When the Spanish arrived, they found Guarani settlements along the Plata River coast in what is now the Partido de Avellaneda and near the Puente de la Noria, where archaeological remains, especially ceramics, have been discovered.

=== Colonial Era ===
The first founding of Buenos Aires took place in 1536, near the Paso de Burgos, close to what is now the Uriburu Bridge, according to the historian S.J. Guillermo Furlong. This suggests that Lanús might have been the site of the oldest settlement in the future Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. This initial settlement had a short lifespan and was only permanently established in 1580 when Juan de Garay founded the city for the second time.

Following the Crown&#x27;s orders, Juan de Garay distributed land to encourage permanent settlement, and residents were required to live there for five years, or else the authorities could reassign the land. The lands that are now part of the Partido de Lanús were part of the Magdalena payment, the La Matanza payment, and the area in between known as the payment of Riachuelo. The first landowners in the district included Juan Torres de Vera y Aragón, whose property was also known as Estancia del Adelantado. Since they didn&#x27;t meet the residency requirement, their lands were later redistributed to various settlers, such as the cove of Juan Ruíz, Giovanna Gomez, and Pedro de Jerez.

=== Independence Era ===
Around 1856, the total population of the district was estimated to be 5,099 inhabitants, with only 2,444 of them being criollos. The rest consisted of 819 French, 528 Spanish, 496 Italians, 247 English, 217 Germans, and so on. The primary sources of employment were the thirteen saladeros (meat salting and processing establishments) and farms. There were ten bakeries, nine greengrocers, twelve butchers, eight meat-selling carts in the countryside, twenty-two stores, ninety-six small general stores, thirteen taverns, and twelve billiard halls. Throughout the district, there were 19 two-story houses and 203 one-story houses, with 1,217 being brick, thatched roof, or zinc-roofed huts. There were six educational institutions and two chapels: Nuestra Señora del Tránsito or Los Grigera in Lomas and Nuestra Señora del Rosario or the Italian chapel in Barracas al Sur.

=== Separation from the Partido de Avellaneda ===
Efforts to gain autonomy for the district date back many years. The goal was eventually achieved with the emergence of the &quot;Unión Vecinal Autonomista,&quot; whose members used the number 111 as their symbol and campaigned to achieve the long-awaited autonomy.

The Partido de Lanús officially became independent on January 1, 1945, bearing the number 111 among the districts of the Buenos Aires province, as decreed on September 29, 1944. Juan Ramón Piñeiro was appointed as the municipal commissioner. With this, Lanús separated from the Partido de Avellaneda, which it had been part of until then under the name &quot;4 de junio.&quot;

On June 13, 1945, a decree expanded its jurisdiction with the annexation of Remedios de Escalada, known for its railway workshops and previously belonging to the Partido de Lomas de Zamora.

On October 19, 1955, the dictatorship self-styled as the &quot;Revolución Libertadora&quot; changed the name &quot;4 de junio&quot; to &quot;Lanús,&quot; a name that remains in use today.

The first local newspaper was &quot;La Comuna,&quot; founded in 1910. The Juan Bautista Alberdi library was established nine years later and currently houses 22,000 volumes. The municipal library, founded in 1949, holds 11,000 copies of books and magazines.

In November 1986, the &quot;Plazoleta Héroes de Malvinas&quot; was inaugurated in Gerli, featuring an airplane and a cannon facing the Malvinas Islands, in tribute to those who died during the war.

Lanús is also home to the prominent &quot;Hospital Interzonal General de Agudos Evita,&quot; founded on August 30, 1952, where patients from other suburbs are treated. Additionally, there are the private clinics Modelo and Estrada, both equipped for high-complexity care.

Since the restoration of democracy in 1983, Manuel Quindimil served as the mayor. He had previously held the position during the 1973-1976 period. Quindimil&#x27;s long tenure as mayor ended in the elections of October 28, 2007, when he lost to Darío Díaz Pérez of the Frente para la Victoria. Currently, Néstor Grindetti serves as the mayor of the district.

<text>Bank Hapoalim ( lit. &quot;The Workers&#x27; Bank&quot;) is one of the largest banks in Israel, established in 1921. The bank offers a broad range of financial services to retail, corporate, and institutional customers, with a focus on retail banking services. It operates a network of more than 250 branches and offices in Israel and abroad. Bank Hapoalim is a prominent player in the Israeli banking sector, with a significant market share.

The company is traded in the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange under the symbol POLI, and is part of the Tel Aviv 35 Index. Reuven Krupik was appointed Chairman of the Board in 2020, and Yadin Antebi was appointed CEO in August 2024, succeeding former CEO Dov Kotler.

==History==
The bank was established in 1921 by the &quot;Histadrut&quot;, the Israeli trade union congress (lit. &quot;General Federation of Laborers in the Land of Israel&quot;) and the Zionist Organisation.

The bank was owned by the &quot;Histadrut&quot; until 1983, when it was nationalized following the Bank Stock Crisis. The bank was held by the Israeli government until 1996 when it was sold to a group of investors led by Ted Arison.

The bank has a significant presence in global financial markets. In Israel, it has over 600 ATMs (automated teller machines), 250 bank branches, 7 regional business centers, 22 business branches and industry desks for major corporate customers. The bank&#x27;s stock is traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.

At the end of 2015, the bank had 11,930 employees worldwide. Up until 2018, Arison Holdings, led by Shari Arison, owned approximately 20% of Bank Hapoalim’s shares. In late 2018, Arison announced the gradual sale of her holdings, concluding this process in September 2022 when shares worth over one billion shekels were sold, leaving the bank without a controlling shareholder. 

In 2021, the bank reported a net profit of 915 million shekels ($267 million) in Q4 2020, compared to a net loss of 629 million shekels in Q4 2019. The bank&#x27;s credit portfolio continued to grow, and it entered the digital wallet sector and made deals with banks in Bahrain and the UAE as a part of the Abraham Accords.

Net profit for 2023 totaled NIS 7,360 million, compared with NIS 6,532 million in 2022. The main driver of the increase is 19.3% growth in income, which was driven by rate hikes and the growth in activity, and despite a NIS 1.9 million credit loss provision booked in 2023.

==Global presence==
The bank has operated several international subsidiaries: In the City of London and Poalim Asset Management (UK) Limited; in the United States (New York City, California, and Miami) and in Canada; BHI Private Banking, Switzerland Bank Hapoalim (Switzerland) Ltd., Zürich, Geneva, Luxembourg, South America, and the Cayman Islands. In recent years, the bank&#x27;s international presence has significantly reduced, and by 2023, only the New York branch remained operational. 

==2018-2022==
Bank Hapoalim reached an agreement that canceled the labor dispute called by the Histadrut labour federation in December. The January 2020 deal, according to the regulatory filing by the bank in Tel Aviv, suggests to raise worker wages by an average of 3.7% from 2018 to 2022, bank employees will also get a one-time grant of 210 million shekels ($60.6 million), whereas the bank also plans to reduce its workforce by over 900 jobs through an early retirement plan.

== 2023-present ==
In 2023, Bank Hapoalim, along with other leading banks in Israel, faced criticism from the Governor of the Bank of Israel, Professor Amir Yaron, for generating significant profits while providing insufficient service to clients. The bank reported record-breaking financial performance, with net profits amounting to billions of shekels. At the same time, customers expressed dissatisfaction with low interest rates on deposits, which did not align with the rising interest rates on loans. This sparked a broad public debate over the fairness of banking policies amid the increasing cost of living in the country.

== The Bank&#x27;s Organizational Structure ==
Bank Hapoalim Group operates in Israel across various banking sectors and related capital market activities through four main divisions: the Corporate Division, the Retail Division, the Financial Markets and International Banking Division, and the Innovation and Strategy Division.

=== Corporate Division ===
This division serves business clients. In the large corporations sector, it operates through industry-specialized sectors, while in the Middle Market sector, it operates through business centers distributed across Israel. Additionally, the division provides customer service via dedicated service centers offering operational support and through a foreign trade system that serves all bank customers.

=== Retail Division ===
This division caters to households, private banking clients, foreign residents, and small businesses through 204 branches, investment consulting centers, and a mobile branch serving customers at approximately 37 service points (about half of which are in retirement homes). It also offers various direct channels, including self-service machines in branches and customer premises, &quot;Hapoalim Internet,&quot; &quot;Hapoalim Mobile,&quot; the &quot;Hapoalim by Phone&quot; call center, a voice system for information retrieval and transactions, and social media inquiry services.

=== Poalim Equity ===
The real investments and investment banking arm of Bank Hapoalim, invests in equity and debt in private companies across various sectors in Israel and worldwide. The company provides loans and offers integrated growth solutions for private companies.

Additionally, Poalim Equity operates an alternative investment platform, which includes investments in local and international private equity funds, the establishment of funds, and syndication investments for institutional entities. The company also provides advisory services for investment banking, supports mergers and acquisitions processes, facilitates private capital raises, and assists with public offerings of Israeli or Israel-affiliated companies on U.S. stock exchanges through a partnership with the American investment bank William Blair.

Poalim Equity holds a 20% stake in Leader Capital Markets, one of Israel’s leading underwriting firms. As a subsidiary of Bank Hapoalim, Poalim Equity invests in equity and debt in private companies, grants loans, and provides integrated growth solutions to a wide range of businesses.

=== Financial Markets and International Banking Division ===
This division coordinates the bank group&#x27;s activities in most capital market areas in Israel and abroad. These activities include providing securities trading services (brokerage), securities custody, currency and derivatives trading, research and consulting services, support for financial asset managers, investment portfolio management, investment banking, underwriting services, and issuance management.

=== Innovation and Strategy Division ===
This division is responsible for the development of the &quot;Bit&quot; payment application.

== Hapoalim Investments ==
&quot;Hapoalim Investments&quot; was the bank&#x27;s investment house, established in 1963 under the name &quot;Bank Hapoalim Investment Company Ltd.&quot; Over the years, &quot;Hapoalim Investments&quot; became one of Israel&#x27;s leading companies in promoting diverse investments in fields such as industry, advanced technology, communications, advertising, computing, trade, real estate, and more. In 1996, &quot;Ordan Industries&quot; acquired the controlling shares in the company from Bank Hapoalim for 206 million shekels, following the recommendations of the David Brodet Committee to reduce economic concentration in Israel by limiting banks&#x27; holdings in real corporations. In 2001, the company&#x27;s name was changed to Polar Investments. By 2013, &quot;Polar Investments&quot; entered into a debt arrangement.

== Controversies and criticism ==

===Tax evasion and money laundering===
On 30 April 2020, the bank was found to be complicit in tax evasion and money laundering relating to FIFA and bidding for the World Cup. It was ordered to pay fine of $874.3 million after pleading guilty to the first charge, which involved helping US taxpayers to stash some $7.6 billion in more than 5,500 secret Swiss and Israeli bank accounts. It was the second-largest recovery by the US Department of Justice since it began investigating the facilitation of US tax evasion by foreign banks in 2008.

It was ordered to pay $30 million in forfeitures and fines in relation to the second charge, which pertained to helping launder more than $20 million in bribes and kickbacks for officials involved in the corruption scandal that embroiled football&#x27;s world governing body FIFA in 2015. Internal Revenue Service criminal investigation chief Don Fort said, &quot;There is no excuse for a foreign financial institution to unlawfully assist wealthy Americans in flouting their responsibilities to pay their taxes. With today&#x27;s guilty plea, Bank Hapoalim is taking responsibility for their role in deliberately breaking the law and undermining the integrity of this nation&#x27;s tax system.&quot;

Assistant attorney general Brian Benczkowski stated that &quot;for nearly five years, Bank Hapoalim employees used the US financial system to launder tens of millions of dollars in bribe payments to corrupt soccer officials in multiple countries&quot;, while William Sweeney, assistant director of the FBI&#x27;s New York field office, said that &quot;Bank Hapoalim admits executives looked the other way, and allowed illicit activity to continue even when employees discovered the scheme and reported it.&quot;

===Involvement in Israeli settlements===

In January 2014, Danske Bank and the Dutch pension fund PGGM blacklisted Bank Hapoalim for its involvement in the financing of settlements in the Palestinian territories.

In October 2017, Danish pension firm Sampension banned investment in Hapoalim alongside three other companies operating in illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including Bank Leumi, Israeli telecoms firm Bezeq and German firm Heidelberg Cement.

On 12 February 2020, the United Nations published a database of 112 companies helping to further Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as well as in the occupied Golan Heights. These settlements are considered illegal under international law. Bank Hapoalim was listed on the database on account of its &quot;provision of services and utilities supporting the maintenance and existence of settlements&quot; and &quot;banking and financial operations helping to develop, expand or maintain settlements and their activities&quot; in these occupied territories.

On 5 July 2021, Norway&#x27;s largest pension fund KLP said it would divest from Bank Hapoalim together with 15 other business entities implicated in the UN report for their links to Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.

== Issuance of the Bank&#x27;s Commemorative Stamp ==
To mark its 100th anniversary, the bank, in collaboration with Israel Post and the Philatelic Service, issued the &quot;Centennial Stamp,&quot; designed by stamp designer Miri Gistor.

<text>Lomas de Zamora is a city in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, located south of the City of Buenos Aires and within the metropolitan area of Greater Buenos Aires. It is the capital of Lomas de Zamora Partido and has a population of 111,897.

==Overview==
The city of Lomas de Zamora owes its name to Juan de Zamora, a Creole of Sevillian roots, owner of the lands in 1736. Towards the end of 1860 a large number of people of British origin settled in the area. These English, Scottish and Irish had arrived as employees of Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway.

The English educational institution, St. Alban&#x27;s College was established in the area about 1920.

Lomas de Zamora is located in a region that originally supported livestock, grain, fruit, and poultry farms. Present industries include meat packing, grain, and fruit processing, saw milling, and the manufacture of dairy products, chemicals, paper, rubber products, plastics, and leather goods.

The city is the site of the traditional Lomas Athletic Club, an agricultural school and an art museum. The Universidad de Lomas de Zamora (UNLZ) is one of the most important in the Greater Buenos Aires area. Founded in 1864 as &quot;Ciudad de La Paz&quot;, the city was given its current name in 1910; the art deco city hall was inaugurated in 1938.

The city&#x27;s local football team is Los Andes, usually referred to as the &quot;Mil rayitas&quot; or &quot;The thousand stripes&quot; because of the design of the team&#x27;s official jersey. Los Andes is currently playing in Argentina&#x27;s National B Division; the team&#x27;s home matches usually brings thousands of fans.

Eduardo Duhalde, a Justicialist Party figure elected mayor in 1983, was elected Vice President of Argentina in 1989, Governor of Buenos Aires Province in 1991, and was appointed interim President of Argentina, serving in 2002-03; he was among the candidates for the presidency in 2011.

Lomas de Zamora experienced one of the most significant real estate booms in the Greater Buenos Aires area in the years following the 2001 crisis in Argentina. This trend has been most evident along Colombres Street (south of downtown), creating an upscale district popularly known as &quot;Las Lomitas&quot;. Nearly 200 new residential high-rises had thus been completed by 2011. A four-star, 26-story Howard Johnson&#x27;s hotel was slated to open in 2013, becoming the first of its kind in the southern belt of the Greater Buenos Aires area, but after several years of delay the project has been abandoned in 2015 when investor Finarg went broke. In October 2018 two local business men were detained for alleged irregularities in the planning of the hotel.

<doc id="735976" wikidata="Q221921" url="?curid=735976" title="Comodoro Rivadavia">
<text>Comodoro Rivadavia (), often shortened to Comodoro, is a city in the Patagonian province of Chubut in southern Argentina, located on the San Jorge Gulf, an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean, at the foot of the Chenque Hill. Comodoro Rivadavia is the most important city of the San Jorge Basin, and is the largest city in Chubut as well as the largest city south of the southern 45th parallel.

The city is often referred to simply as &quot;Comodoro&quot;. It was at one time the capital of the Comodoro Rivadavia Territory, which existed from 1943 to 1955. The territory was a part of Chubut before and after its creation, and the city became the capital of the Escalante Department. It had a population of 137,061 at the , and grew to 182,631 by the 2010 census. Comodoro Rivadavia is a commercial and transportation center for the surrounding region, the largest city of Chubut, and an important export point for a leading Argentine petroleum district. A 1,770 km pipeline conveys natural gas from Comodoro Rivadavia to Buenos Aires.

Founded by decree on February 23, 1901, as a port for the inland settlement of Sarmiento, the first settler was Francisco Pietrobelli. Early settlers included Boers escaping British rule in South Africa, as well as Welsh settlers. The town was named in honour of shipping minister Martín Rivadavia, a proponent of the development of Southern Argentina. It has been prosperous since 1907, when a drilling crew searching for water struck oil at a depth of 539 meters.

The city is the home of the main faculty of the National University of Patagonia San Juan Bosco. Its cathedral is the seat of the Diocese of Comodoro Rivadavia, of which the Bishop is, since 2005, Virginio Domingo Bressanelli. The Cathedral is dedicated to San Juan Bosco, the only cathedral in the world dedicated to the founder of the Salesian Order. It was inaugurated in 1979, although the crypt itself had been dedicated in 1949.

Rada Tilly is a beach resort and now suburb 12 km south of Comodoro. The National Museum of Petroleum is located in the General Mosconi neighbourhood 3 km north of central Comodoro Rivadavia. It was opened in 1987 by the state-owned oil company YPF.

Comodoro Rivadavia is served by General Enrique Mosconi International Airport (Airport Code CRD/SAVC) with daily flights to Buenos Aires and many other Patagonian cities, as it is the main hub of LADE.

== History ==

The urgency to define short routes to transport products from Colonia Sarmiento and bring them to that village created the necessity of a port in the area of San Jorge Gulf. This necessity made possible the foundation of Comodoro Rivadavia, today capital of petroleum in Argentina. The first governor of Gobernación Nacional del Chubut was Colonel Luis Jorge Fontana, who traveled around the whole extension attributed to Chubut commanding a numerous group of Welsh immigrants in 1885.
American researcher Junius Bird and Finnish geographer Väinö Auer confirmed the existence of the Tehuelche people, who lived in the area of Rada Tilly some 9000 years ago. This information was confirmed by Father Brea, who some years ago contributed to this theory with the discovery of utensils and human remains near Rada Tilly.

It is widely known that the Tehuelche, who came from the north of Patagonia during the warm summer, used to make camp where Rada Tilly is today. The English navigator Robert FitzRoy was the first to mention its existence in a navigation chart.

On March 10, 1889, Francisco Pietrobelli, accompanied by the Tehuelche man Sainajo and Marcelo Pereira, came to Rada Tilly following FitzRoy&#x27;s navigation charts in search of an anchoring place to set up a deep-water port where deep-draft ships could stop to supply the flourishing Colonia Sarmiento.

The corvette &quot;La Argentina&quot;, commanded by Commodore Martín Rivadavia, arrived near Mount Chenque in an exploratory mission and settled an anchorage place now called Kilometro 5, Caleta Córdova or Punta Borjas. Pietrobelli completed the construction of the first storage shed on June 26 in the place indicated years before by a Schinus molle trunk. Commodore Rivadavia became the first Argentine marine to anchor his corvette in Rada Tilly in March 1891, while he was reconnoitering the area to control the displacement of the Chilean Army in the Argentine south. The village was named after the Spanish marine Francisco Everardo Tilly y Paredes, who during 1794 and 1795 gave combat and defeated the Portuguese army at the Rio Plata.

The settlement was renamed Comodoro Rivadavia on February 23, 1901 by decree of the national government, in homage to the illustrious marine, grandson of the great statesman and first Argentine president, Bernardino Rivadavia.

===Discovery of oil===
In 1903 six hundred Afrikaner families arrived in Argentina following the loss of the Second Boer War and were given farming land in the lands around Comodoro Rivadavia. However, due to a shortage of water, they had to bring water in by ox wagon with the lack of it being a big impediment to the development of the settlement. At the Afrikaners&#x27; insistence drilling began in 1907 in an effort to look for water but instead they struck oil. Although much of the oil was discovered on land given to Afrikaans settlers, they could not benefit directly from the discovery due to Argentinian law which decrees that all mineral deposits belong to the state. Therefore, most of the town&#x27;s Afrikaans settlers moved on to Sarmiento and surrounding regions to set up farms there.

The discovery of oil in 1907 boosted economic growth in Comodoro Rivadavia. By the end of 1919, most of the 1719 workers were given accommodation in small metal sheet houses without any heating or electric light with temperatures below zero and winds near 100 km/h. The establishment of Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF) in 1922 led to the development of the town, further accelerated in the late 1950s by President Arturo Frondizi&#x27;s oil campaign to foster the installation of numerous foreign companies. The city evolved around this industry, and even today when this panorama has changed substantially, it is still called the &quot;National Oil Capital.&quot;

The beach village Rada Tilly was founded on July 24, 1948, and today is an important hub for tourism in Argentina. Oil production has begun to decline in quantity but the area has been turning its attention to wind power. Windmills on Cerro Chenque and surrounding hills comprise South America&#x27;s largest wind farm and provide 20% of Comodoro&#x27;s energy needs.

== Climate ==
Comodoro Rivadavia features a cold semi-desert climate (&quot;BSk&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification, and it has a subtropical climate — all 12 monthly means &gt;6°C as per John Griffiths — and is one of the southernmost locations in the world to have one. While the city receives just over 250 mm of rain annually, its relatively low evapotranspiration rate causes it to fall under this climate, as opposed to the arid (desert) category. Summer is warm to hot and dry with an average temperature of in January. Winter is mild with an average temperature of in July. Precipitation is low, though the winter months receive more precipitation than in summer.

== Population ==

Comodoro Rivadavia had a population of 182,631 inhabitants in 2010, compared to 135,632 in 2001 and 124,104 in 1991. The city grew by about a third between 2001 and 2010, compared to an increase of 9.2% between 1991 and 2001. The national average was of around 11% in both periods, representing a notable acceleration in population growth for the city in comparison to Argentina. The city size places Comodoro Rivadavia as the 20th largest city of the country and the largest in South Patagonia, which goes from Chubut to Tierra del Fuego.

=== Urban areas ===

Comodoro Rivadavia is the biggest city to the south of the Colorado River. The city developed from the oil camps which evolved into neighbourhoods.

The city is divided into three main areas: North Area, South Area and Downtown Area.

The South Area is the most populated in the city. The neighbourhoods are: Jorge Newbery, San Martin, 1311 Viviendas, Cerro Solo, Ñaco, San Cayetano, Francisco Pietrobelli, Las Flores, La Floresta, Máximo Abasolo, Moure, Cordón Forestal, Quirno Costa, Maestro Isidro Quiroga, Juan XIII, San Isidro Labrador, 9 de Julio, 13 de Diciembre, Julio A. Roca, Juan Manuel de Pueyrredon, 30 de Octubre, LU4, Abel Amaya, Industrial, Stella Maris, Ceferino Namuncurá, Jose Fuchs, Balcón del Paraiso, Covipex, Rincón del Diablo, 311 Viviendas and Humberto Beghin.

The Downtown area is divided into: Centro, Loma and Civico neighbourhood. 
The Northern Area is divided into:
* 3rd Kilometre
* 4th Kilometre, home of National University of Patagonia San Juan Bosco.
* 5th Kilometre.
* 6th Kilometre, home of General Enrique Mosconi International Airport) and Petroleros Privados.
* 8th Kilometre.


== Economy ==

=== Industry and commerce ===
The commercial and industrial activities of the city are the most important in the region. The main activities of the city are: production of chemical products, elaborated concrete, salter, fabrication of industrial houses, shipyard, metallurgical products, refrigerated products, industrial factories, casting, textile industry, blocks and bricks, and cement.

=== Oil industry ===

The oil production started in Chubut in 1907, when a drilling rig which was looking for water discovered oil instead. The Argentine oil industry started in Comodoro Rivadavia, and was facilitated by the 1886 National Mining Code (&quot;Codigo de Mineria de la Nación&quot;). This code established that the oil fields belonged to the State, and that they could also be exploited by the private sector by concession.

In 1922 YPF (&quot;Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales&quot;), the first state-owned oil company in the world, was created by President Hipólito Yrigoyen&#x27;s government. This company helped the society by improving the construction of houses, providing new jobs and health care. Engineer Enrique Mosconi was in charge of running the company. By 1933, 1,648 wells had been drilled in Comodoro Rivadavia; 88.9% of them were economically productive.
In 1935 the First Oil Law was passed. It established that the National and provincial States would receive as contribution the 12% of the Gross Product from all oil drilling, which is still in effect.

In 1958, Law Number 14,773 was signed by President Arturo Frondizi, establishing that the Government had exclusive ownership over all oil fields.

The most important oil fields discovered during the 60&#x27;s were El Huemul and Piedra Clavada. At the beginning of the same decade twenty wells were drilled.

Between 1977 and 1986, 100 million m3 oil were drilled from San Jorge gulf, in the meantime the oil reserves reached 40 million m3; in 1979 the San Jorge gulf production reached 10,124,022 m3 of oil.

Until 2001, 5,300 wells were drilled, of which 3,000 were economically productive. As a result of the exploratory activities developed during the century, the remaining reserves reach 182.017 million m3 of oil. San Jorge gulf is the leader in oil extraction. 46,000 m3 per day are extracted in the zone, representing 46% of total crude oil production in the nation.

==Geography==
Comodoro Rivadavia is situated in the south of Argentina in the province of Chubut, on the coast of San Jorge Gulf.

It was necessary to create a port in the area of San Jorge Gulf in order to have shorter routes for transporting products from and to the town of Sarmiento, situated 180 km away from the city of Comodoro Rivadavia.

===Foundation and history ===
Since 1908, the small and weak port Maciel received passengers and shipments that arrived at the city of Comodoro Rivadavia. It was built of wood and only could support small ships. In 1923, the construction of the port started. In 1926 the construction was stopped, but in 1928 it was resumed.

===Facilities===
The shipyard has two parallel industrial facilities of 70 meters long and 4 meters wide. This allows the repair and building of ships in a roofed space without the weather affecting the activity. The shipyard has three travelling cranes of 8 tons each. Works made in the shipyard include the building of eolic mill towers and oil buoys.

The port facilities include:
* The principal Port situated near the downtown. Its extreme point called Punta Borja, was designed to receive ships up to 181 meters length and 10 meters depth. The port has a pier of 216 meters long, which was built to meet the demand of the transportation of commodities, deep-sea fishing and naval repairs.
* Caleta Cordova&#x27;s low tide pier is located in the north of Comodoro Rivadavia city, over the coast of Caleta Cordova&#x27;s neighborhood. This pier meets the demand of artisan fishing.
* Repsol-YPF&#x27;s pier, located in the south of General Mosconi neighbourhood, is used for unloading fuel. The total fuel unloaded is over 29,000 liters per month.
* Caleta Olivares&#x27;s facilities are used to load crude oil. It has four mooring buoys and one bell buoy. The depth of this area is 9 meters.
* Caleta Cordova&#x27;s facilities for loading crude oil include one charge buoy and four mooring buoys. These facilities located away from the coast are used for mooring ships up to 100.000 tons and 11 meters depth.
=== Production of concrete ===
The city also is home to a factory that produces concrete, property of Petroquimica Comodoro Rivadavia S.A. It produces different types of concrete: Standard Portland, Puzolanic, BCA, ARI, bricklaying concrete Caltex, concrete for oil industry. The total production of concrete for the year 2002 was 228,000 tons.

=== Wind energy ===
The wind farm of Comodoro Rivadavia has a capacity of 18,820 kW with 26 generators, and is the most important in Latin America. Plans exist to connection it the national energy, which could allow the sale of energy to other regions.

== Sports ==
The most important sports in the city of Comodoro Rivadavia are basketball, football and car racing, among others such as land yachting, judo, rugby and athletics.

Comodoro Rivadavia is the home of the basketball team Gimnasia y Esgrima (Comodoro Rivadavia). Other local basketball clubs are Nautico and Federacion Deportiva.

The most popular football clubs are CAI (Comisión de Actividades Infantiles), Huracán, which plays in the Argentine Tournament &quot;B&quot; and Club Atlético Jorge Newbery.

Comodoro Rivadavia also has a football league in which many teams participate; the principal teams are Jorge Newbery, Huracán and Petroquímica. There are other clubs such as Tiro Federal, Universitario, Ferroviario, Usma, Tiro Federal and Portugues, which are located in the First A League of Comodoro Rivadavia.

Land yachting has become very popular in the city and the beaches of Rada Tilly, together with the windy climate, are ideal to practise the sport.

The World Championship of Landyachting was held in 2008 in Rada Tilly.

<text>Kaya is the tenth studio album by the Jamaican band Bob Marley and the Wailers, released in 1978. The album consists of tracks recorded alongside those released on the &quot;Exodus&quot; album. It was produced by the band.

The album&#x27;s release coincided with the One Love Peace Concert, heralding Marley&#x27;s triumphant return to Jamaica from exile in London. Three of the songs are new versions of tracks from the 1971 album &quot;Soul Revolution Part II&quot;. &quot;Kaya&quot; reached the top five in the UK album charts.

==Critical reception==

Lester Bangs, in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, wrote: &quot;Musically, &quot;Kaya&quot; is a succession of the most tepid reggae clichés, pristinely performed and recorded, every last bit of tourist bait (down to the wood blocks) in place just like a Martin Denny record.&quot; The &quot;Bay State Banner&quot; noted that &quot;the Wailers take freely from Gamble &amp; Huff&#x27;s chords, Euro-disco&#x27;s burping bass, and pop-soul ballads&#x27; blithe strings and synthesizers, but they funk up and condense these styles and use reggae&#x27;s chicken scratch and snap-on drumming as disco employs congas: for a counter-voice to handle the unspeakable passions in a song.&quot; &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; opined that &quot;Marley&#x27;s reggae, expansive as always, has this time failed to integrate the Jamaican and American elements.&quot;

<doc id="735982" wikidata="Q806641" url="?curid=735982" title="Bank Leumi">
<text>Bank Leumi (, lit. &quot;National Bank&quot;; ) is an Israeli bank. It was founded on February 27, 1902, in Jaffa as the &quot;Anglo Palestine Company&quot; as subsidiary of the Jewish Colonial Trust (Jüdische Kolonialbank) Limited formed before in London by members of the Zionist movement to promote the industry, construction, agriculture, and infrastructure of the land hoped to ultimately become Israel. Today, Bank Leumi is Israel&#x27;s largest bank (by total assets as of 2015), with overseas offices in Luxembourg, US, Switzerland, the UK, Mexico, Uruguay, Romania, Jersey, and China.

Though nationalized in 1981, now Bank Leumi is mainly in private hands, with the government as the largest single shareholder, with 14.8% of the stock (as of June 2006). The other major shareholders are Shlomo Eliyahu and Barnea Investments, which each hold 10% of the stock, constituting the control core of the bank. Sixty percent of the bank&#x27;s stocks are held by the public and traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.

==History==
The antecedents of the Jewish Colonial Trust can be traced to Herzl&#x27;s visionary tract &quot;Der Judenstaat&quot; (lit. &quot;The Jewish State&quot;), detailing his vision of how the Jewish State would be created. A major role was assigned in this vision to a huge body, to be called &quot;The Jewish Company&quot;, which would be &quot;founded as a joint stock company subject to English jurisdiction, framed according to English laws, and under the protection of England&quot;. In Herzl&#x27;s vision, this Company would control virtually all the land in Palestine and would take care of transporting there millions of people within a few years – all, or nearly all, Jews living in the world. It would then take care of all the logistics of settling them in their new country, establishing them in urban and rural environments and getting agriculture, trade and industry going. For the Herculean tasks envisioned for it, Herzl estimated that the company&#x27;s capital should be about a thousand million marks (about £50,000,000 or $200,000,000).

In practice, the Zionist movement was completely unable – either politically or financially – to undertake anything of remotely such dimensions. The actual &quot;Jewish Colonial Trust&quot; – established, indeed, in London – was in effect a small-scale model of the company envisioned in &quot;Der Judenstaat&quot;: its capital a small fraction of the sum envisioned for &quot;The Jewish Company&quot; and its activity limited to transporting and settling small numbers of Jews on whatever limited parcels of land in Palestine the Zionist movement managed to buy. Even so, the &quot;Colonial Trust&quot; had a key role in the actual implementation of the Zionist project, towards eventual creation of Israel.

===Jewish Colonial Trust===


The Jewish Colonial Trust (German: Jüdische Kolonialbank), predecessor to the present Bank Leumi, was founded at the Second Zionist Congress in Basel and incorporated in London in 1899 as the financial instrument of the Zionist Organization. The initial capital raised—a total of £395,000—fell far short of the £8 million target; Nahum Sokolow wrote in 1919: &quot;The British East Africa Company, which administered 200,000 square miles, began with the same amount £250,000.&quot;

===Anglo-Palestine Bank===
The bank&#x27;s activities in Palestine were carried out by the Anglo-Palestine Bank, a subsidiary formed in 1902. The bank opened its first branch in Jaffa in 1903 under the management of Zalman David Levontin. Early transactions included land purchase, imports and obtaining concessions. Branches were opened in Jerusalem, Beirut, Hebron, Safed, Haifa, Tiberias and Gaza.

The Anglo-Palestine Bank offered farmers long-term loans and provided loans to the Ahuzat Bayit association which built the first neighborhood in Tel Aviv. During World War I, the Ottoman government declared the bank, which was registered in England, to be an enemy institution and moved to shut it down and confiscate its cash.

After World War I, its operations expanded. In 1932, the main branch moved from Jaffa to Jerusalem. During World War II, the Anglo-Palestine Bank helped to finance the establishment of industries that manufactured supplies for the British army.

===Bank Leumi ===
After the founding of the state of Israel in 1948, the bank won the concession to issue new banknotes. In 1950, the bank was renamed &quot;Bank Leumi le-Israel&quot; (National Bank of Israel). When the Bank of Israel was established in 1954, Bank Leumi became a commercial bank.

In 1971, Bank Leumi acquired Arab Israel Bank (Ai Bank; est. 1960), which serves mainly the Arab Citizens of Israel in the north of the country. Ai Bank has 35 branches located in Israel&#x27;s northern and Triangle regions.

The Government of Israel nationalized Bank Leumi in 1983, as a result of the Bank Stock Crisis.

In 2007, the bank denied being in possession of funds deposited by Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust. Although denying any wrongdoing, in 2011 the bank agreed to pay out 130m NIS after a state inquiry claimed 300m NIS was being held in 3,577 dormant accounts. The bank was accused of refusing to cooperate with the investigation by refraining from disclosing information about the large amounts of unclaimed money.

In 2011, Bank Leumi acquired Geneva-based Banque Safdie SA for CHF 143m. Bank Leumi merged Banque Safdie with Bank Leumi Switzerland Ltd to form Leumi Private Bank in early 2012.

Leumi closed its representative office in Melbourne, Australia in October 2013.

In July 2014, Bank Julius Baer announced that it had purchased the private banking assets of Bank Leumi. Baer bought Bank Leumi (Luxembourg) S.A., Leumi&#x27;s private bank in Luxembourg and Leumi will also transfer the clients of Leumi Private Bank to Baer.

In July 2019, Samer Haj-Yehia was appointed chairman.

Bank Leumi USA, the bank&#x27;s U.S. subsidiary, was purchased by Valley National Bank in 2022 for US$1.2 billion in cash and stock.

In 2023 Pablo Rosenberg and Gal Toren began to serve as presenters of the Bank.

==Controversy==

In October 2017, Danish pension firm Sampension banned investment in Leumi alongside three other companies operating in illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including Bank Hapoalim, Israeli telecoms firm Bezeq and German firm Heidelberg Cement.

On 12 February 2020, the United Nations published a database of 112 companies helping to further Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as well as in the occupied Golan Heights. These settlements are considered illegal under international law. Bank Leumi was listed on the database on account of its &quot;provision of services and utilities supporting the maintenance and existence of settlements&quot; and &quot;banking and financial operations helping to develop, expand or maintain settlements and their activities&quot; in these occupied territories.

On 5 July 2021, Norway&#x27;s largest pension fund KLP said it would divest from Bank Leumi together with 15 other business entities implicated in the UN report for their links to Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.

==Architecture==
The main branch of Bank Leumi on Jaffa Road, Jerusalem, built during the British Mandate by the German Jewish architect Erich Mendelsohn, has been declared a landmark building.

The Bank Leumi branch on the corner of Ramban Street in Jerusalem&#x27;s Rehavia neighborhood, an example of Bauhaus architecture, was designed by the German Jewish architect Leopold Krakauer. It was built in 1935 as a private home, and was renovated in 2007 to restore the original facade.

==Global presence==
* Luxembourg – Due to the activities of Bank Leumi, David Kalai, and Nadav Kalai, Bank Leumi entered into a deferred prosecution agreement, in December 2014, with the US Department of Justice admitting that it conspired to hide assets and income in offshore accounts. The bank paid a fine of $270 million and turned over more than 1,500 names of its U.S. account holders.
* Canada – Leumi has representative offices in Toronto and Montreal
* Romania – Bank Leumi Romania S.A.
* Switzerland – Leumi Private Bank
* UK – Bank Leumi (UK) plc
* Uruguay – Leumi (Latin America) SA
* US – Bank Leumi USA -- purchased by Valley National Bank in 2022

<text>La gazza ladra (, The Thieving Magpie) is a &quot;melodramma&quot; or opera semiseria in two acts by Gioachino Rossini, with a libretto by Giovanni Gherardini based on &quot;La pie voleuse&quot; by Théodore Baudouin d&#x27;Aubigny and Louis-Charles Caigniez.
&quot;The Thieving Magpie&quot; is best known for the overture, which is musically notable for its use of snare drums. This memorable section in Rossini&#x27;s overture evokes the image of the opera&#x27;s main subject: a devilishly clever, thieving magpie.

Rossini wrote quickly, and &quot;La gazza ladra&quot; was no exception. A 19th-century biography quotes him as saying that the conductor of the premiere performance locked him in a room at the top of La Scala the day before the premiere with orders to complete the opera&#x27;s still unfinished overture. He was under the guard of four stagehands whose job it was to toss each completed page out the window to the copyist below.

==Performance history==

The first performance of &quot;The Thieving Magpie&quot; was on 31 May 1817, at La Scala, Milan. In 1818, Rossini revised the opera for subsequent productions in Pesaro; and then in 1819 for the Teatro del Fondo, in Naples; in 1820 for the Teatro di San Carlo, in Naples; and in 1866 he revised the music for performance in Paris. The 1866 revision included embellishments and variations written specifically for Giuseppina Vitali, who was singing the role of Ninetta. He revised the role again in 1867 with embellishments and cadenzas for Adelina Patti.

The first performance of &quot;The Thieving Magpie&quot; in England was at the King&#x27;s Theatre, London, on 10 March 1821. A French-language opera-comique using the original title of the French source material (&quot;La pie voleuse&quot;) in a version translated by Castil-Blaze was premiered in Lille, France, on 15 October 1822. The French-language version&#x27;s first performance in the United States was at the Théâtre d&#x27;Orléans, New Orleans, on 30 December 1824.

In 1941, Riccardo Zandonai composed a version of &quot;The Thieving Magpie&quot; for a revival of the opera in Pesaro. In 1979, Alberto Zedda edited Rossini&#x27;s original composition of the opera for publication by the Fondazione Rossini. In 2013, the Bronx Opera of New York City performed an English-language version of &quot;La gazza ladra&quot;.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==
===Act 1===
At the house of Fabrizio Vingradito and his wife Lucia there is joy for the imminent return of their son Giannetto from the war. One of the servants, Ninetta, is in love with Giannetto and all want the two to marry, except Lucia, who blames Ninetta for the recent loss of a silver fork. Isacco, a local peddler, visits and asks about Ninetta, but Pippo, Fabrizio&#x27;s manservant, sends him away. Giannetto arrives and goes inside with Lucia while Ninetta prepares for the party. Once they have gone, Ninetta&#x27;s father, Fernando Villabella, arrives, also from the war. However, he was sentenced to death after fighting with his captain and is now a deserter. He asks his daughter to sell two pieces of family silver to go towards his expenses while he is on the run. The Mayor arrives with intent on seducing Ninetta, and she claims that her father is just some vagrant. The Mayor&#x27;s assistant delivers the arrest warrant for a deserter (Fernando), but as the Mayor has forgotten his reading glasses, Ninetta is asked to read the warrant, and makes up a description of someone totally unlike her father. The Mayor continues to force his attentions on Ninetta, at which Fernando almost reveals himself in anger. The three leave, and a magpie flies down and steals one of Lucia&#x27;s silver spoons.

Isacco passes by again, and Ninetta sells him the silver her father had entrusted to her. Giannetto and others return, and Lucia notices that a spoon is missing. The Mayor starts an immediate investigation, stating the draconian penalty for domestic theft: death. Lucia and the Mayor accuse Ninetta, who in her distress drops the money she had exchanged from Isacco. The peddler is brought back and reports that he has already sold the spoon, but he recalls the inscription &quot;F.V.&quot;, initials shared by Fabrizio and Fernando. The stunned Ninetta, desperate to protect her father, is unable to refute the accusations, and the Mayor orders her arrest.

===Act 2===
Antonio, the prison warder, takes pity on Ninetta and says that he will get a message to Pippo and let Giannetto visit her. Ninetta convinces Giannetto that she is innocent. The Mayor now arrives and tells Ninetta that if she accepts his advances he will get her freed – she replies that she would rather die. The Mayor is called away, but Antonio has heard all and offers to help Ninetta any way he can. Ninetta asks Pippo to sell a gold cross and put some money for her father in an agreed hiding place – a chestnut tree. Ninetta is brought to trial, found guilty, and condemned to death. Fernando rushes to the court to save his daughter&#x27;s life, but is too late; he too is sent to prison.

Ernesto, a military friend of Fernando, bursts in looking for the Mayor and holding a royal pardon for Ninetta&#x27;s father. Pippo shows him the way and is given a silver coin for helping, but the magpie snatches it and flies up to the tower. Pippo and Antonio pursue the thief.

Ninetta is taken to the scaffold and makes her final speech to the crowd. From the tower, Pippo and Antonio cry out that they have found Lucia&#x27;s silver in the magpie&#x27;s nest and they ring the bells. The crowd hear their words and hope to save Ninetta, but shots ring out and they conclude that they are too late. However, Ninetta appears walking down the hill – the shots were mere rejoicing. Ninetta celebrates with her companions but is worried about her father. He then appears with Ernesto and all – except the Mayor – enjoy a happy ending.

==Arias==

The most famous aria in the opera is probably Ninetta&#x27;s prayer &quot;Deh, tu reggi in tal momento&quot;. The soprano cavatina &quot;Di piacer mi balza il cor&quot; and the tenor cavatina &quot;Vieni fra queste braccia&quot; (the cabaletta for the duet between Arturo and Elvira from Bellini&#x27;s &quot;I Puritani&quot; starts with exactly the same words) are two examples of Rossini&#x27;s brilliant vocal writing.

==Act One==
* Cavatina – Di piacer mi balza il cor (Ninetta)
* Cavatina – Stringhe e ferri – Isacco
* Cavatina – Vieni fra queste braccia – Gianetto
* Brindisi – Tocchiamo, Beviamo – Pippo
* Duetto – Come frenare il pianto – Ninetta e Fernando
* Cavatina – Il mio piano è preparato – Podestà
* Terzetto – Oh Nume benefico

==Act Two==
* Duetto – Forse un dì conoscerete – Ninetta e Giannetto
* Aria – Si per voi, pupille amate – Podestà
* Duetto – Ebben, per mia memoria – Ninetto e Pippo
* Aria – Accusato di furto – Fernando
* Aria – A questo seno – Lucia
* Preghiera – Deh tu reggi in tal momento – Ninetta

==Recordings==
==Film==
An animated short film called &quot;La gazza ladra&quot; was made in 1964 by Giulio Gianini and Emanuele Luzzati using the overture as the soundtrack, with motion synchronized to the music. It was constructed by moving cutouts from frame to frame to illustrate a story of a thieving magpie, centered on the magpie, unlike in the opera. In 1965 the film was nominated for an Academy Award and won the first Grand Prix of the Melbourne International Film Festival.

Stanley Kubrick used the overture for the early scenes of his movie &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. The music gives the viewer a voyeuristic insight into the exhilaration that the sociopathic narrator Alex obtains from a typical night out with his friends performing acts of violence and mayhem while mindless of the horrific consequences for his victims. 

The overture served as influence in John Williams’s Aunt Marge’s Waltz from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

<text>USS &quot;Yorktown&quot; (DDG-48/CG-48) was a in the United States Navy from 1984 to 2004, named for the American Revolutionary War Battle of Yorktown.

==History==
&quot;Yorktown&quot; was launched 17 January 1983 and was sponsored by Mrs. Mary Matthews, widow of Nick Matthews, a prominent citizen of Yorktown, Virginia. &quot;Yorktown&quot; was commissioned on 4 July 1984 at Yorktown, Virginia, and was designed to take advantage of the American Aegis technology. Among its various weapon systems were surface to air missiles (SAMs), anti-ship/anti-submarine missiles, torpedo launchers, and a mounted cannon.
&quot;Yorktown&quot;″s first deployment was from August 1985 to April 1986 and, among other things, involved the &quot;Achille Lauro&quot; hijacker intercept, two Black Sea excursions (in 1986 and 1988), and a trio of operations off the Libyan coast including Operation El Dorado Canyon and Operation Attain Document and Prairie Fire.

&quot;Yorktown&quot; received the Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s &quot;Top Gun&quot; award for outstanding naval gunfire support in 1987. During the second deployment from September 1987 to March 1988, &quot;Yorktown&quot; participated in numerous U.S. and NATO exercises, as well as multi-national exercises with Morocco, France, West Germany, Tunisia, and Turkey. It was on this Mediterranean deployment that &quot;Yorktown&quot; gained worldwide publicity from operations conducted in the Black Sea as part of Freedom of Navigation program. On 12 February 1988, while &quot;Yorktown&quot; was exercising the &quot;right of innocent passage&quot; through Soviet territorial waters, the Soviet &quot;Bezzavetnyy&quot; () intentionally collided with &quot;Yorktown&quot; with the intention of pushing her out of Soviet territorial waters. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs at the time, Richard L. Armitage, acknowledged that the transit was not operationally necessary, but asserted that it was still a valid innocent passage under international law.

In 1991, &quot;Yorktown&quot; was awarded the coveted &quot;Old Crow&#x27;s&quot; award for electronic warfare excellence. In 1992 &quot;Yorktown&quot; was honored with the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for superb, sustained combat readiness.

&quot;Yorktown&quot; conducted her third and fourth Mediterranean deployments as the world watched the end of the Cold War and the coalition victory in Operation Desert Storm. During the latter of these two deployments &quot;Yorktown&quot; participated in the first U.S. military exercises with the Romanian and Bulgarian navies, and played a key role in Operation Provide Comfort, which provided humanitarian relief and security for the Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq. In the summer of 1992, &quot;Yorktown&quot; participated in BALTOPS &#x27;92. During this cruise, &quot;Yorktown&quot; made a highly acclaimed port visit to Severomorsk, Russia, becoming the first U.S. ship to visit that port since the end of World War II.

In 1993, &quot;Yorktown&quot; was awarded the Commander, Naval Surface Forces, Atlantic Ship Safety Award for a superior safety record. &quot;Yorktown&quot; has also been awarded two Navy Unit Commendations and a Meritorious Unit Commendation, and is a four-time winner of the coveted Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot;.

&quot;Yorktown&quot; served as Flagship for Commander, Task Group 4.1, during counter-drug operations in the Caribbean in May–July 1993. In August 1993, &quot;Yorktown&quot; participated in the joint military exercise Solid Stance in the North Atlantic. &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s operations through the end of 1993 included an October–November excursion to the Caribbean to support the United Nations embargo of Haiti. In April–May 1994, &quot;Yorktown&quot; returned to the Caribbean as Force Air Warfare Commander during joint Exercise Agile Provider. While in the Caribbean, &quot;Yorktown&quot; served as flagship for Commander, Destroyer Squadron Six, coordinating a six-ship, twenty-six missile exercise. In the summer of 1994, &quot;Yorktown&quot; achieved a resounding score of 101 during naval gunfire support qualification.

In August 1994 &quot;Yorktown&quot; set sail for the Adriatic Sea as flagship for Commander, Standing Naval Force Atlantic, in support of the United Nations embargo of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. During this six-month deployment, &quot;Yorktown&quot; served as the Air Warfare Commander for the Adriatic Sea, participating in a joint task force of ships from the United States and eight European nations. In May–June 1995, &quot;Yorktown&quot; proceeded south to serve as Air Warfare Commander for the Caribbean Sea in support of counter-narcotics operations.

In May 1997 &quot;Yorktown&quot; (with a reduced crew aboard) completed a five-month counter-narcotic deployment in the Caribbean followed by tests with and her accompanying Cruiser-Destroyer Group 2. During these periods Navy Manpower and Analysis Center (NAVMAC) conducted a detailed review of manpower requirements, and the Operational Test and Evaluation Force verified the ship&#x27;s ability to meet all required operational capabilities in the projected operating environment doctrine for &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruisers.

On 21 September 1997, a division by zero error on board the USS Yorktown (CG-48) &quot;Remote Data Base Manager&quot; brought down all the machines on the network, causing the ship&#x27;s propulsion system to fail.

On 25 September 1999 &quot;Yorktown&quot; departed Pascagoula for a four-month counter-narcotic deployment in the Caribbean. Before beginning patrolling efforts, &quot;Yorktown&quot; embarked staff members from Commander, Second Fleet. Supported by the helicopter detachment, the Second Fleet staff surveyed and photographed another island being considered as a potential replacement for training exercises if the Navy was unable to continue at Vieques Island, Puerto Rico. The ship made port calls in Jamaica, Aruba, Cartagena, Rodman, Manta and Cozumel. During this deployment the USS Yorktown was the last U.S. warship to transit the Panama Canal prior to it being turned over to Panama.

==Fate==

&quot;Yorktown&quot; was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 10 December 2004. As of 2008, it was scheduled to be dismantled in the next five years along with its sisterships and . Since its decommissioning, &quot;Yorktown&quot; has been berthed at the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

On 16 September 2022, &quot;Yorktown&quot; was removed from the Philadelphia NIMSF and began its journey to Brownsville, Texas, where it will be scrapped. It arrived in Brownsville on 29 November 2022.

== Smart ship testbed ==
From 1996 &quot;Yorktown&quot; was used as the testbed for the Navy&#x27;s Smart Ship program. The ship was equipped with a network of 27 dual 200 MHz Pentium Pro-based machines running Windows NT 4.0 communicating over fiber-optic cable with a Pentium Pro-based server. This network was responsible for running the integrated control center on the bridge, monitoring condition assessment, damage control, machinery control and fuel control, monitoring the engines and navigating the ship. This system was predicted to save $2.8 million per year by reducing the ship&#x27;s complement by 10%.

On 21 September 1997, while on maneuvers off the coast of Cape Charles, Virginia, a crew member entered a zero into a database field causing an attempted division by zero in the ship&#x27;s Remote Data Base Manager, resulting in a buffer overflow which brought down all the machines on the network, causing the ship&#x27;s propulsion system to fail.

Anthony DiGiorgio, a civilian contractor with a 26-year history of working on Navy control systems, reported in 1998 that &quot;Yorktown&quot; had to be towed back to Norfolk Naval Station. Ron Redman, a deputy technical director with the Aegis Program Executive Office, backed up this claim, suggesting that such system failures had required &quot;Yorktown&quot; to be towed back to port several times.

In the 3 August 1998 issue of &quot;Government Computer News&quot;, a retraction by DiGiorgio was published. He claims the reporter altered his statements, and insists that he did not claim the &quot;Yorktown&quot; was towed into Norfolk. &quot;GCN&quot; stands by its story.

Atlantic Fleet officials also denied the towing, reporting that &quot;Yorktown&quot; was &quot;dead in the water&quot; for just 2 hours and 45 minutes. Captain Richard Rushton, commanding officer of &quot;Yorktown&quot; at the time of the incident, also denied that the ship had to be towed back to port, stating that the ship returned under its own power.

Atlantic Fleet officials acknowledged that the Yorktown experienced what they termed &quot;an engineering local area network casualty&quot;. &quot;We are putting equipment in the engine room that we cannot maintain and, when it fails, results in a critical failure,&quot; DiGiorgio said.

Criticism of operating system choice ensued. Ron Redman, deputy technical director of the Fleet Introduction Division of the Aegis Program Executive Office, said that there have been numerous software failures associated with NT aboard the Yorktown.

<doc id="735996" wikidata="Q1464793" url="?curid=735996" title="Niantic people">
<text>The Niantic (Nehântick or Nehantucket) are a tribe of Algonquian-speaking American Indians who lived in the area of Connecticut and Rhode Island during the early colonial period. The tribe&#x27;s name &quot;Nehântick&quot; means &quot;of long-necked waters&quot;; area residents believe that this refers to the &quot;long neck&quot; or peninsula of land known as Black Point, located in the village of Niantic, Connecticut. 

The Niantic people were divided into eastern and western groups due to intrusions by the more numerous and powerful Pequots. The Western Niantics were subject to the Pequots and lived just east of the mouth of the Connecticut River, while the Eastern Niantics became very close allies to the Narragansetts. It is likely that the name Nantucket is derived from the tribe&#x27;s endonym, Nehantucket.

The division of the Niantics became so great that the language of the eastern Niantics is classified as a dialect of Narragansett, while the language of the western Niantics is classified as Mohegan-Pequot. Today, only western Nehantics are known to exist, in the area of coastal New London County, Connecticut.

== Language ==
The Niantics spoke an Algonquian Y-dialect similar to their neighbors the Pequots, Mohegans, and Narragansetts in New England, and the Montauks on eastern Long Island.

== Lifeways == 
Prior to European colonization of their lands, the Niantics spent their summers fishing and digging the shellfish which were abundant there and for which the area is famous. They cultivated the Three Sisters: maize, beans, and squash. They also hunted, fished, and collected nuts, roots, and fruits. During the Late Woodland period, they also dined on snake and turtle meat. 

== History ==
=== Precontact history ===
Like the Narragansetts, the Niantics lived around salt ponds mainly in what is now coastal Rhode Island, in semi-permanent settlements or dispersed villages. Socially, the Niantic community valued both personal autonomy and group unity, with individual families responsible for providing for themselves. They crafted shell artworks but did not create too many projectile points, showing similar shared culture extending from southern Connecticut to Long Island to Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. The arrival of the Mohegan and Pequot peoples in the southeastern Connecticut region led to the split of the Niantic people into Western Niantic and Eastern Niantic divisions.

=== 17th century ===
By the time European settlers arrived in southern Rhode Island in 1636, the Niantic and Narragansett peoples were closely related, both in terms of sociopolitics and family groups. The Eastern Niantic population, led by Ninigret, lived primarily in the areas of present-day Westerly, Rhode Island, and Charlestown, Rhode Island.

Conflict developed between the Niantics and their colonial neighbors, with the English colonists conducting punitive military expeditions against the Niantics, resulting in massive destruction. The violence became more widespread on both sides of the conflict and degenerated into the Pequot War in 1637. This conflict resulted in almost total destruction of the Western Niantics by the colonists and their Indian allies; the roughly 100 surviving members of the Western Niantics merged into the Mohegans.

Some members of the Mohegans can trace their ancestry back to the Niantics, especially in the vicinity of Lyme, Connecticut. Following King Philip&#x27;s War (1675–1676), the Narragansetts were reduced in population from 5,000 to a few hundred, while Eastern Niantics were largely spared due to Ninigret&#x27;s neutrality during the conflict. Surviving Narragansetts fled to the Eastern Niantics in such great numbers that the tribe became known as the Narragansetts. Eastern Niantics continued to lead the joined tribes; by 1679, Ninigret had been succeeded by his daughter Weunquest, who died circa 1686.

=== 18th century ===
Entering the 18th century, the Eastern Niantic-Narragansett community in Rhode Island was one of the largest in Southern New England, with 300-500 Eastern Niantics outnumbering the surviving Narragansetts. Weunquest&#x27;s half-brother Ninigret II succeeded her, and under his leadership, the Niantic-Narragansetts received their reservation in 1709. He died in 1723, by which time the Eastern Niantics were fully known as Narragansetts. Alcoholism, political infighting, and pressure from the European settlers in the area began to harm the tribe, with population shrinking to 51 families by 1730.

By the autumn of 1713, Christian missionaries had begun to try converting Eastern Niantics to Christianity, though they were met with resistance. In the 1720s, a more concentrated, organized effort began, but success was largely limited to those Eastern Niantics who had been taken as household servants and slaves by European families. Widespread interest in Christianity did not begin amongst the Western or Eastern Niantics until 1743, after which distinct congregations formed for each group.

In 1733, Western Niantics travelled to Woodstock, Connecticut, from East Lyme, Connecticut, in order &quot;to barter their skins and furs for powder, shot, rings, knives, cloth, pipes, tobacco, beads, lace, whistle and other commodities&quot; with local merchants.

In October 1761, Ezra Stiles encountered a Western Niantic community of 85 people, including 56 children, in the present-day village of Niantic. He sketched their wigwams and noted similarities between the design they used and those used by the Kickapoo. He further reported that 11 Niantic men had been killed between 1755-1761 while serving with colonial troops.

By the end of the 1700s, the Niantic peoples had adopted many aspects of Yankee New England culture, including adopting the dominant culture&#x27;s religious beliefs, style of dress, and class system. In 1780, residents of New Shoreham, Rhode Island, voted to take Eastern Niantic-Narragansett land on the grounds that &quot;the native Indians [are] extinct in [this] Town.&quot;

=== 19th century ===
Following the American Revolution, numerous Eastern Niantic families fled west and joined the Brotherton Indians in New York and eventually Wisconsin. Those that remained were often seen by political leaders as separate from the white community but also not as Indigenous, resulting in Niantics being listed as &quot;Black&quot; or &quot;Negro&quot; in Rhode Island town records, a reclassification that would make it difficult for them to maintain their claim on their ancestral lands.

By 1870, the Western Niantics were declared extinct by the state of Connecticut, which sold their reservation on the Black Point peninsula of East Lyme. In 1886, the state sold their burial ground, which was desecrated. The Crescent beach community was developed on top of this area. Niantic skeletal remains have been uncovered during excavation for new construction projects over the years, as recently as 1988.

In 1880, the Eastern Niantic-Narragansett reservation was sold to the state of Rhode Island, with only the church remaining under their control.

=== 20th century ===
In the early 20th century, Mohegan people of southeastern Connecticut considered Western Niantic peoples to be amongst their elders, turning to them for additional guidance on sacred traditions, medicine, symbolism, and tribal history.

In the 1930s, Niantics attended a gathering at Mashapaug Pond in Providence, Rhode Island that also included Narragansetts, Nipmucks, Wampanoags, Passamaquoddys, and Misquamicuts.

In 1998, about 35 Connecticut families claiming Niantic descent incorporated as the Nehantic Tribe and Nation nonprofit association. They established a three-person governing board, researched their history more fully, and began the petition process of seeking recognition from the federal government as an Indian tribe.

<doc id="735998" wikidata="Q8010948" url="?curid=735998" title="William Harrison Folsom">
<text>William Harrison Folsom (March 25, 1815 – March 19, 1901) was an architect and contractor. He constructed many of the historic buildings in Utah, particularly in Salt Lake City. Many of his most prominent works were commissioned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). For a time he was sustained as the Church Architect, a calling in the church.

==Personal life==
Folsom was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. By the age of 16 he held a supervisory position in his father&#x27;s contracting firm. Folsom directed up to hundreds of employees on dock projects around Lake Erie. He and his father then moved to Buffalo, New York, where they ran a building business.

In New York Folsom met his future wife Zervial Eliza Clark, whom he married at age 22 on August 12, 1837. Folsom also encountered Latter Day Saint stonemason Enoch Reese, who helped convert him to Mormonism. Folsom and his wife were baptized members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in a frigid Niagara River on February 17, 1842.

Folsom and his wife traveled to Nauvoo, Illinois, in the spring of 1842. Nauvoo was then headquarters of the church, and Folsom became an acquaintance of Joseph Smith, the church&#x27;s founder.

==Early career==
Folsom worked on the Nauvoo Temple until its completion in May 1846, when Mormons were forced from Nauvoo. He worked on the temple with Truman Angell and Miles Romney both of whom became lifelong friends. At this point Folsom moved to Keokuk, Iowa. In 1851 he traveled to the Sacramento California area to the town of Rough and Ready where he worked on water projects that were needed to mine gold. He then returned to his family in 1852.

Folsom committed to follow Brigham Young to the Salt Lake Valley. In 1854, he set out for Salt Lake City but arrived at Council Bluffs, Iowa, ten days too late to join the last company west. Instead, he stayed at Council Bluffs for six years employed as a builder. Notably, he worked on columns for the Nebraska Territory capitol building, which were transported across the Missouri River from Council Bluffs to Omaha.

In 1860, Folsom finally set out for Utah Territory with a relatively large outfit of four wagon teams. Soon after his October 3 arrival in Salt Lake City, Folsom opened shop on Main Street downtown. Brigham Young, president of the LDS Church, put him to work on church projects almost immediately. He was sustained as Church Architect in the October 1861 General Conference.

==Architect==
Folsom worked prolifically in the 1860s. By 1864, he was planner in two constructions firms, one was with Miles Romney. Folsom himself drew the plans or was involved in the construction of many historic Utah buildings including the Old Salt Lake Theatre, the Salt Lake Tabernacle, the Salt Lake City Council Hall, the Provo Tabernacle, the Provo Theatre, the Moroni Tabernacle, and the original ZCMI building in downtown Salt Lake City. Folsom also had ecclesiastical duties in the LDS Church, serving first as a stake high councilor and then as first counselor in the Salt Lake Stake Presidency in 1874.

In 1867, Truman O. Angell, who had recovered from poor health, was again made church architect and Folsom was made his assistant. In 1877, while serving as an assistant to the church architect, Folsom was called by the LDS Church to design the Manti Temple; Folsom lived in Manti, Utah, until the temple&#x27;s completion in 1888. Returning to Salt Lake City, he was building inspector under Mayor John Clark until 1890. Folsom served some of his last years as an LDS Church stake patriarch before his death.

<doc id="736018" wikidata="Q1398935" url="?curid=736018" title="Consumption function">
<text>In economics, the consumption function describes a relationship between consumption and disposable income. The concept is believed to have been introduced into macroeconomics by John Maynard Keynes in 1936, who used it to develop the notion of a government spending multiplier.

==Details==
Its simplest form is the &quot;linear consumption function&quot; used frequently in simple Keynesian models:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the autonomous consumption that is independent of disposable income; in other words, consumption when disposable income is zero. The term formula_3 is the induced consumption that is influenced by the economy&#x27;s income level formula_4. The parameter formula_5 is known as the marginal propensity to consume, i.e. the increase in consumption due to an incremental increase in disposable income, since formula_6. Geometrically, formula_5 is the slope of the consumption function. 

Keynes proposed this model to fit three stylized facts:

* People typically spend a part, but not all of their income on consumption, and they save the rest. They typically do not borrow money to spend, or borrow money to save. This fact is modelled by requiring formula_8.
* People with higher income save a higher proportion of the income. This is modelled by formula_9 decreasing with formula_10.
* People, when deciding how much to save, are insensitive to the interest rate.
By basing his model in how typical households decide how much to save and spend, Keynes was informally using a microfoundation approach to the macroeconomics of saving.

Keynes also took note of the tendency for the marginal propensity to consume to decrease as income increases, i.e. formula_11. If this assumption is to be used, it would result in a nonlinear consumption function with a diminishing slope. Further theories on the shape of the consumption function include James Duesenberry&#x27;s (1949) relative consumption expenditure, Franco Modigliani and Richard Brumberg&#x27;s (1954) life-cycle hypothesis, and Milton Friedman&#x27;s (1957) permanent income hypothesis.

Some new theoretical works following Duesenberry&#x27;s and based in behavioral economics suggest that a number of behavioural principles can be taken as microeconomic foundations for a behaviorally-based aggregate consumption function.

<doc id="736026" wikidata="Q231276" url="?curid=736026" title="Angélique Kidjo">
<text>Angélique Kpasseloko Hinto Hounsinou Kandjo Manta Zogbin Kidjo (; born July 14, 1960) is a Beninese-French singer-songwriter, actress and activist noted for her diverse musical influences and creative music videos. Kidjo has won five Grammy Awards and is a 2023 Polar Music Prize laureate.

In 2007, &quot;Time&quot; magazine called Kidjo &quot;Africa&#x27;s premier diva.&quot; She performed at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony on July 23, 2021. On September 15, 2021, &quot;Time&quot; included her in their list of the 100 most influential people in the world.

Kidjo is fluent in five languages: Fon, French, Yorùbá, Gen (Mina) and English. She sings in all of them, and she also has her own personal language, which includes words that serve as song titles such as &quot;Batonga&quot;. Kidjo often uses Benin&#x27;s traditional Zilin vocal technique and vocalese.

==Early life==
Kidjo was born in Ouidah, French Dahomey, in what is now Benin. Her father is from the Fon people of Ouidah and her mother from the Yoruba people. Her father was a musician, and her mother worked as a choreographer and theatre director. She grew up listening to Yoruba and Beninese traditional music, Miriam Makeba, Hugh Masekela, James Brown, Manu Dibango, Otis Redding, Jimi Hendrix, Fela Kuti, Stevie Wonder, Osibisa and Santana. By the time she was six, Kidjo was performing with her mother&#x27;s theatre troupe, giving her an early appreciation for traditional music and dance.

She started singing in her school band, Les Sphinx, and found success as a teenager with her adaptation of Miriam Makeba&#x27;s &quot;Les Trois Z,&quot; which was played on national radio. Kidjo recorded the album &quot;Pretty&quot; with Cameroonian producer Ekambi Brilliant and her brother Oscar. It featured the songs &quot;Ninive,&quot; &quot;Gbe Agossi&quot;, and a tribute to the singer Bella Bellow, one of her role models. The success of the album allowed her to tour all over West Africa. Continuing political conflicts in Benin prevented her from being an independent artist in her own country and led her to relocate to Paris in 1983.

==Paris==
Due to political conflicts, Kidjo left Benin and moved to Paris in the 1980s. She initially planned to become a human rights lawyer, but ended up studying music. While working various day jobs to pay for her tuition, Kidjo studied music at the CIM, a jazz school in Paris, where she met musician and producer Jean Hebrail, with whom she has composed most of her music and whom she married in 1987. She started out as a backup singer in local bands. In 1985, she became the front singer of Jasper van &#x27;t Hof&#x27;s Euro-African jazz/rock band Pili Pili. Three Pili Pili studio albums followed: &quot;Jakko&quot; (1987), &quot;Be In Two Minds&quot; (1988, produced by Marlon Klein) and &quot;Hotel Babo&quot; (1990). By the end of the 1980s, she had become one of the most popular live performers in Paris and recorded a solo album called &quot;Parakou&quot; for the Open Jazz Label. She met Island Records founder Chris Blackwell in Paris; Blackwell signed her to a record deal in 1991. She recorded four albums for Island until Blackwell&#x27;s departure from the label. In 2000 she was signed in New York by Columbia Records, for whom she recorded two albums.

== Albums ==

===&quot;Parakou&quot;===
Kidjo&#x27;s first international album &quot;Parakou&quot;, first released in 1989, was the beginning of a series of collaborations with producer and composer Jean Hébrail and featured Jasper van&#x27;t Hof.

===&quot;Logozo&quot;===
Her first album for Island Records was recorded between Miami and Paris and produced by Miami Sound Machine drummer Joe Galdo and features Branford Marsalis and Manu DiBango on saxophones. It was released worldwide in 1991 and reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; World Albums chart. Music videos for the singles &quot;We We&quot; and &quot;Batonga&quot; were released and Kidjo made her first world tour, headlining the Olympia Hall in Paris on October 31, 1992. &quot;Logozo&quot; is ranked number 37 in the Greatest Dance Albums of All Time list compiled by the Thump website.

===&quot;Ayé&quot;===

Released in 1994, the album &quot;Ayé&quot; was produced by David Z at Prince&#x27;s Paisley Park Studios in Minnesota and by Will Mowat at Soul To Soul studio in London. It includes the single &quot;Agolo&quot;, a song that addresses the issue of the environment, of which the video directed by Michel Meyer gave Kidjo her first Grammy nomination. Kidjo sang on the album in both Yoruba and Fon, often using the Beninese traditional zilin vocal technique.

===&quot;Fifa&quot;===
Kidjo and Hebrail traveled all over Benin in 1995 to record the traditional rhythms that formed the base for the &quot;Fifa&quot; album. Carlos Santana appears on &quot;Naima&quot;, a piece Kidjo wrote for her daughter. The single &quot;Wombo Lombo&quot; and its video directed by Michel Meyer was a success all over Africa in 1996.

===Trilogy===
In 1998, she began recording a trilogy of albums (&quot;Oremi&quot;, &quot;Black Ivory Soul&quot; and &quot;Oyaya&quot;) exploring the African roots of the music of the Americas.

====&quot;Oremi&quot;====
Produced by Peter Mokran and Jean Hebrail, recorded in New York, &quot;Oremi&quot; is a collection of songs mixing African and African-American influences. Cassandra Wilson, Branford Marsalis, Kelly Price and Kenny Kirkland collaborated with Kidjo on this project. The opening track is a cover of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Voodoo Child&quot;.

====&quot;Black Ivory Soul&quot;====
In 2000, Kidjo traveled to Salvador de Bahia to start recording the Axe percussion grooves for this album, based on Afro-Brazilian culture. She worked with songwriters Carlinhos Brown and Vinicius Cantuária. On the Brazilian version of the album Gilberto Gil joined her on &quot;Refavela&quot; and Daniella Mercury on &quot;Tumba&quot;. Dave Matthews appears in the song &quot;Iwoya&quot;.

====&quot;Oyaya!&quot;====
Produced by Steve Berlin from Los Lobos and by the pianist Alberto Salas, released in 2004, &quot;Oyaya!&quot; mixes Latin and Caribbean music with African guitars. French Guyanese musician Henri Salvador joined Kidjo on the song &quot;Le Monde Comme un Bébé&quot;.

===&quot;Djin Djin&quot;===
Kidjo released the album &quot;Djin Djin&quot; on May 1, 2007. Many guests appear on the album including Josh Groban, Carlos Santana, Alicia Keys, Joss Stone, Peter Gabriel, Amadou and Mariam, Ziggy Marley and Branford Marsalis. The title refers to the sound of a bell in Africa that greets each new day.

===Batonga Foundation===
In 2006, Kidjo founded the Batonga Foundation with the goal of empowering and educating adolescent girls in sub-Saharan Africa.

In this, Batonga remains true to its core mission— to shine a light on the most overlooked girls in Francophone West Africa and empower them to be agents of change in their communities and their own lives.

====History====
Growing up, Kidjo was one of the few girls in Benin to receive an education. She invented the word &quot;Batonga&quot; as a joyfully defiant response to those who told her that girls did not belong in the classroom. Later, it would become the title of a hit song for the Grammy-winning singer/songwriter and the name of her non-profit organization.

In 2006, Kidjo founded the Batonga Foundation with the goal of empowering and educating adolescent girls in sub-Saharan Africa. Batonga has since provided girls in five African countries (Mali, Benin, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia and Cameroon) with 5,000 academic years of education through scholarships and in-kind support, supplied 8,727 students access to wells and latrines across 7 schools in Benin, and offered 222,000 students in Benin&#x27;s poorest regions TOMS shoes for the walk to school.

In 2015 and 2016, under the guidance of the intentional design team at Population Council, Batonga began to shift away from the scholarship model and formal education initiatives that tended to leave behind society&#x27;s most vulnerable. Batonga began instead focusing on innovative education programs geared toward the most excluded young women and girls. Today, Batonga focuses primarily on providing girls with safe spaces and mentors, equipping them with life and financial literacy skills, and helping them start small businesses.

<text>There was a high level of [[conscientious objection]] in [[East Germany]].

==Introduction of conscription==
In April 1962 the GDR government introduced military conscription. The period of compulsory service was at least 18 months, and adult males between 18 and 26 were eligible. Service in the National People&#x27;s Army (in German abbreviated as NVA), the paramilitary forces of the People&#x27;s Police and the motorised rifles regiment of the Ministry for State Security fulfilled this service obligation. (In the Federal Republic of Germany, conscription was introduced in 1958.)

In the first year, despite the possibility of imprisonment or worse, 231 draftees refused to serve. Most were members of the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. The number increased to 287 when the second year&#x27;s cohort was conscripted.

The GDR&#x27;s socialist government viewed conscientious objectors as enemies of the state, and all 287 were arrested. When the country&#x27;s influential Protestant Church protested, the government decided to provide a legal means for conscientious objectors to serve as non-combatants in the armed forces.

==&quot;Baueinheiten&quot;==
On 16 September 1964 the GDR government announced the formation of non-combat construction units, or &quot;Baueinheiten,&quot; to provide an alternative for conscripts who could not bear arms because of a personal objection to military service. The &quot;Bausoldaten&quot; lived in barracks and were subject to military discipline, but did not bear arms or participate in combat training. Their grey uniforms resembled those of the regular infantry with the symbol of a spade on their shoulder boards which had pale green edges. Normally, construction units were isolated from soldiers in regular units to prevent the spread of pacifist ideas.

Though outwardly peaceful in appearance, soldiers in &quot;Baueinheiten&quot; were obliged to make a promise of loyalty in which they stated that they would &quot;fight against all enemies and obey their superiors unconditionally&quot;, though this was replaced by an oath to &quot;increase defence readiness&quot; in the 1980s. 

They performed military construction and rear-guard services, repaired tanks and military equipment, as well as some tasks in the industrial and social-service sectors, were subject to military law and disciplinary regulations, were commanded by NVA officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs), and received engineer training and political education. 

In 1983, of the 230,000 soldiers in the NVA, 0.6 percent—about 1,400—were allowed to serve in the construction units. According to one report, however, the number of conscripts electing such service was so high that draft officials claimed the plan was over fulfilled, and in 1983 young East Germans unwilling to bear arms had to join the regular troops. In February 1983, in Schwerin, Dresden, and East Berlin, five young men were sentenced to eighteen months in prison because they tried to exercise their right to join the construction units. 

Service in the construction troops did, however, have certain consequences. In the 1970s, East German leaders acknowledged that former construction soldiers were at a disadvantage when they rejoined the civilian sphere. They were not allowed to enter certain professions or to pursue a university education. In 1984, however, SED General Secretary Erich Honecker and Defence Minister Army General Heinz Hoffmann asserted that construction soldiers no longer suffered such discrimination; like others who had completed their military service, they were given preference in the university admission process.

==Prague Spring==
In 1968 Warsaw Pact states, with the tacit support but not direct involvement of East Germany, invaded Czechoslovakia and deposed Alexander Dubček in what came to be known as the Prague Spring.

This invasion appalled people all over the world, but especially East Germans, many of whom felt guilty for letting their government support it. Following the Prague Spring, many young East German men refused to serve even in &quot;Baueinheiten&quot;, as they felt that something akin to another Prague Spring could be just around the corner, and they wished to play no part in it.

==Leaving East Germany==
Between 1984 and 1985, 71,000 East Germans were expelled from the country for participation in civil rights movements. Many people who wished to emigrate from East Germany would do things such as refuse to serve in the NVA to be put on the &quot;black list&quot; and expelled.

By the late 1980s, the vast majority of conscientious objectors was composed of people who wished to emigrate.

<text>The Salt Lake City Council Hall is currently home to offices of the Utah Office of Tourism and the Utah Film Commission and is located on Capitol Hill in Salt Lake City, Utah. Built in 1864–66, the building is historically important as the Old Salt Lake City Hall or just Old City Hall from 1866 to 1894. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1975, as an emblem of (and site of events relating to) the conflicts between the governments of the Utah Territory and the United States in the 19th century.

==Construction==
Council Hall was originally Salt Lake City Hall, built to replace an older, smaller city hall completed just six years earlier on the eve of the Utah War, a standoff between Latter-day Saints (&quot;Mormons&quot;) and federal troops. This small city hall was almost immediately inadequate for the growing city, so planning work on a new City Hall began by 1863.

Ground for the new hall was broken on February 8, 1864 under the direction of the prolific Salt Lake City architect William H. Folsom who was then the official architect for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Built at First South and 120 East (more on Salt Lake City&#x27;s coordinate system), sandstone for the structure was delivered from Red Butte Canyon on Utah&#x27;s first chartered railroad. The well-furnished Greek revival building was completed at a cost of $70,000.

In January 1866, City Hall was dedicated by George Q. Cannon, a prominent LDS leader. Many other LDS leaders attended the dedication including Brigham Young. This is unsurprising because territorial and city politics were controlled by &quot;The People&#x27;s Party&quot;, which was the political organ of the LDS Church. The mayor at the time was People&#x27;s Party member Abraham O. Smoot, the first of six mayors that would use the building. The People&#x27;s Party would control Mayor&#x27;s office until 1890 when the Liberal Party (territorial non-Mormon party) gained control of city government, partially because of anti-polygamy legislation which barred many Mormon polygamists from holding office.

==History==

Six rooms on the first floor housed the mayor&#x27;s office and other city departments. From 1866 until the completion of the Salt Lake City and County Building in 1894, the City Hall was the seat of Salt Lake City Government and meeting place for the Utah Territorial legislature. The Rose Room on the second floor served both as a general courtroom and the legislative floor.

The Assembly Hall was often the site of tension between Mormons, non-Mormons, and federal troops, but possibly the most dramatic event occurred in August 1874; Mayor Daniel H. Wells declared martial law from the balcony of City Hall. This was in response to US Marshal arrests of several Salt Lake City police officers in concert with taking over the polls for election of a Utah representative to congress.

After 1894 the city used the Hall as police headquarters until 1915. Following this the building was used in minor capacities by the city.

To make way for a federal office building downtown, the old City Hall was relocated to Capitol Hill in 1961. The building itself and land were donated by the city and the LDS Church to the state of Utah. The LDS Church also underwrote most of the $300,000 cost for dismantling the building exterior into 325 sandstone slabs. They were numbered and reassembling around all-new woodwork on Capitol Hill. The state paid for most landscaping, furnishing, and other peripheral work at the building&#x27;s current location just south of the State Capitol. Restoration was done under the direction of architect Edward O. Anderson, and was mostly finished by 1962. The building was renamed &quot;Council Hall.&quot;

<doc id="736048" wikidata="Q7649196" url="?curid=736048" title="Suspended cymbal">
<text>A suspended cymbal is any single cymbal played with a stick or beater rather than struck against another cymbal. Common abbreviations used are &quot;sus. cym.,&quot; or &quot;sus. cymb.&quot; (with or without the period).

Most drum kits contain at least two suspended cymbals: a crash cymbal and a ride cymbal.

==History==
The term comes from the modern orchestra, in which the term &quot;cymbals&quot; normally refers to a pair of clash cymbals. The first suspended cymbals used in the modern orchestra were one of a pair of orchestral cymbals, supported by hanging it bell upwards (&quot;i.e.&quot;, with concavity opening downward) by its strap. They could be used as a replacement for a gong. This technique is still used, at times, but has largely been replaced by specialised cymbals with larger mounting holes that can be mounted on a cymbal stand.

Occasionally the term &quot;suspended cymbal&quot; is still used in the original sense of one of a pair of orchestral cymbals hung by its strap, and this is the usage in older scores and may be the wish of modern conductors in playing them. It is essential to check this before committing to a particular technique.

==Technique==
In an orchestral setting, suspended cymbals are most often used for rolled crescendos, or swells. To do this, the percussionist uses a single-stroke roll on the outside edge of the cymbal, using soft mallets, one on each side. The terminology most commonly used to describe this technique is a suspended cymbal roll. At times, a score also calls for hitting the cymbal with a stick or scraping it with a triangle beater. Other techniques utilize the bow of a contrabass, to be drawn slowly across the outside rim of the cymbal. This technique will give a very shrill, eerie sound, particularly useful in film music. Another lesser-known technique is to place a suspended cymbal upside down on a timpani head. The timpanist is instructed to roll ad lib on the suspended cymbal while moving the timpani pedal up and down as a glissando. Film composer Danny Elfman has made great use of this technique, which needs to be performed in a more &quot;transparent&quot; orchestral setting to be heard.

Other composers will use a sample, or recording, of the cymbal struck by a mallet with a long, natural decay. They will then play that segment backwards, so the effect heard is a crescendo to a crisp cutoff of the sound. This is used to great effect for film and pop music to punctuate scenes in many reality television shows.

==Other uses==
In a drum kit, nearly all the cymbals used are suspended cymbals in the broadest sense, the main exception being the hi-hat cymbal.

<text>The Bank of Israel (, ) is the central bank of Israel. The bank&#x27;s headquarters is located in Kiryat HaMemshala in Jerusalem with a branch office in Tel Aviv. The current governor is Amir Yaron.

The primary objective of the Bank of Israel is to maintain stability in prices and the financial system in Israel. It also administers and implements monetary policy in Israel, conducts foreign exchange operations, supervises and regulates the banking system, takes care of the foreign reserves and operations of the financial market infrastructure. The Bank of Israel has, under Article 41 and 44 of its Statute, the exclusive right to issue Israeli Shekel banknotes and coins.

==History==

=== Establishment and early years ===
When Israel gained independence in 1948, the power of note issuance was vested with the Anglo-Palestine Bank, which was refounded as Bank Leumi in 1950. This was done due to the urgency at the time to produce notes. Monetary policy and banking supervision remained controlled by the Ministry of Finance.

Since a central bank is considered a must in modern countries, in March 1951, a committee was founded called the &quot;committee to establish a state bank&quot;. In the committee were Eliezer Kaplan, Levi Eshkol and others. The committee sent its secretary to the United States to study the way state banks function as well as advised ask the UN for expert advisors. The committee established the aim for the bank to be the stabilization of the currency, the keeping of high levels of production, employment and earnings. 

The foreign experts advised to grant the bank of Israel a standing independent from the ministry of finance, in order to avoid political influences on decisions and the handing out of debt to different sectors. It was advised the bank would be managed by committee members representing the various sectors in the Israeli public. The monetary committee of the Knesset preferred that the bank be run by the governor alone who would be under governmental supervision, that way the bank could prove an effective way to guide the financial markets of the country. In the end it was decided to grant the central bank limited independence, but according to the law it was obligated to cover government expenditure when needed. In 2010, the law was changed and since the Bank of Israel has full independence in setting its monetary policy. 

The Bank of Israel was founded on 24 August 1954, when the Knesset passed the Bank of Israel Law, which ceded the currency issuing and regulatory functions of the Ministry of Finance to the newly formed bank. Control over foreign currency exchange was not given to the bank until 1978. The bank was made completely independent in 1985 and since 1992, the bank manages its monetary policy so as to meet the inflation target set by the Israeli government - which is today a range of between 1 and 3 percent per annum, considered as price stability. Additionally, the bank manages the country&#x27;s Foreign Exchange Reserves.

The bank began operating under the management of its first governor, David Horowitz. The department responsible for issuing banknotes was transferred to the Bank of Israel, which later became the currency department, and the unit for supervising banks from the Ministry of Finance, which also became a department in the bank. Over time, additional units and departments were established in the bank, including the monetary department, the foreign currency supervision department (transferred to the bank in 1978), the foreign currency department, and the research department. 

One of the factors that led to the accelerated decision to establish a central bank was the government&#x27;s difficulty in supervising credit allocation and the lack of oversight over the banking system. Until the establishment of the bank, the bank supervision department was a small division within the Ministry of Finance, lacking the tools to oversee the complex banking system, which included dozens of banking institutions and cooperative credit societies scattered geographically throughout Israel. Through the establishment of a central bank, the government hoped to improve its control over the banking system and credit allocation. After the establishment of the Bank of Israel, the banking system underwent a process of consolidation, during which cooperative societies were merged into larger banks. This trend was encouraged by both the Bank of Israel and the government, as it facilitated government and bank control over credit allocation. 

The establishment of the bank raised hopes for reducing government intervention in the economy and decreasing concentration, although in practice, the result was the opposite – increased government involvement. Some anticipated this development and sought to postpone the establishment of the Bank of Israel, but were unsuccessful. 

=== The 1960s and 1970s ===
David Horowitz served as the bank&#x27;s governor for 17 years. His tenure as governor was characterized in its early years by relative economic stability, rapid growth, and the absence of significant inflation until the early 1960s. In 1962, due to rising living standards and consumption leading to the danger of inflationary pressures (annual inflation reached 9%), wage increases, and a deficit in the balance of payments, a significant devaluation of the pound occurred in 1962 by Finance Minister Levi Eshkol, from 1.80 pounds to the dollar to 3 pounds to the dollar, a devaluation that did not solve the exposed problems. Following the devaluation and budget difficulties, the treasury shifted to an austere fiscal policy. 

In 1966, the economy experienced a severe recession, and the Bank of Israel was forced to adapt its policy to such a situation for the first time. Among other things, three private banks collapsed: Bank Alran, Bank Poalei Agudat Israel, and Bank Credit, and the Bank intervened for the first time to protect depositors using its authority under Section 44 of the Bank of Israel Law. 

In 1971, Moshe Zanbar replaced Horowitz was as governor of the central bank. The Bank of Israel faced unprecedented situations, such as rampant inflation (14% in 1972) and increased public spending following the Six-Day War. The Yom Kippur War and the ensuing energy crisis exacerbated economic problems, inflation, deficits in the balance of payments, and the pace of devaluations. In July 1974, the Bank of Israel intervened in Israel-British Bank and dismissed its management after criminal irregularities were found in the bank&#x27;s management. 

In 1976, Arnon Gafni took office as governor. 

=== 1980s, crisis, introduction of New Israeli Shekel ===
In the year 1982, Moshe Mendelbaum was appointed governor. As governor he had to deal with the severe economic situation that the economy had fallen into due to rampant inflation. Simultaneously, he and the heads of the bank found themselves in one of the toughest economic crises in the history of the State of Israel - the 1983 bank stocks crisis. In the early eighties, inflation spiraled out of control, reaching peaks unprecedented in the country&#x27;s history, and price hikes were a routine matter. In 1984, inflation peaked at 450%. 

In 1984, a National Unity Government was established to tackle the rampant inflation. In 1985, a comprehensive new plan was adopted - the Economic Stabilization Plan, prepared by treasury officials with the assistance of prominent economists from academia, led by Prof. Michael Bruno, accompanied by renowned economists from abroad including Prof. Stanley Fischer. A significant amendment to the Bank of Israel Law was implemented, prohibiting the government from borrowing money from the bank to cover budget deficits, and the shekel was replaced with a new shekel by removing three zeros. The stabilization plan took into account components of a comprehensive rehabilitation plan, and its essence included: significant cuts in the government budget (mainly through noticeable reductions in subsidies and other government expenditures); a decrease in real wages (aimed at reducing local demand, increasing export competitiveness, and preventing severe unemployment growth); high interest rates and stabilization of the exchange rate at the new level for as long as possible; and freezing prices administratively for a limited period. As a result of the plan&#x27;s implementation, which received full support from the government, inflation dropped to single digits (the amendment to the law greatly assisted in this), and the bank&#x27;s position was significantly strengthened.

In 1986, Prof. Michael Bruno, one of the architects of the stabilization plan, was appointed governor of the bank. Further strengthening of the position of the Bank of Israel occurred after the publication of the findings of the Basle Committee in 1986 and the expansion of the Bank of Israel&#x27;s powers as a supervisor of the banks. In 1978, supervision of foreign currency was transferred from the Ministry of Finance to the Bank of Israel. Subsequently, following a prolonged process of liberalization in the foreign currency market, supervision of foreign currency was finally abolished in 2003. The Department for Supervision of Foreign Currency became the &quot;Department of Market Operations in Foreign Currency,&quot; which dealt with monitoring and researching the economy&#x27;s activity against foreign countries and the foreign exchange market. 

After the 1985 Economic Stabilization Plan, the bank&#x27;s position was strengthened, mainly due to the amendment to the Bank of Israel Law, which prohibited the government from borrowing money from the bank to cover budget deficits. 

=== 21st century ===
David Klein was appointed as the seventh governor in 2000 and continued the path of preceding governors: implemented monetary reforms, managed a tough monetary policy, initiated efforts to transfer authority over salary agreements to the Treasury, and liberalized the foreign currency market. During Klein&#x27;s tenure, tensions rose in the field of labor relations. There was also conflict between the Bank of Israel and the Treasury regarding the salary agreements practiced in the Bank of Israel peaked. The background to the dispute was the Basic Budget Law, enacted with the stabilization plan in 1985, which stipulated that public bodies—including the bank—would be subject to this law. The Treasury alleged that the salary agreements in the Bank of Israel deviated from the norm in public service. In 2005, Stanley Fischer was appointed as the eighth governor. Fischer declared his intention to introduce a new law for the Bank of Israel to replace the 1954 law, regulating labor relations with the Treasury concerning salary agreements in the bank, and implementing structural reform in the bank. With the onset of the economic crisis in 2008, Fischer pursued a successful and internationally recognized policy: he adjusted interest rates rapidly (the first in the world to lower and raise interest rates), acquired foreign currency reserves, and purchased government bonds to reduce interest rates for long periods. In 2008, organizational changes were made in the bank, including the closure of the Foreign Exchange Operations Department (which formed the basis for the Information and Statistics Division), the Monetary Department (part of which was merged with the Foreign Exchange Department to create the Markets Division, and another part with the Research Department to create the Research Division), and the State Loans Administration. The bank&#x27;s departments were reorganized into divisions. 

In 2010, the Bank of Israel was ranked first among central banks for its efficient functioning, according to IMD&#x27;s World Competitiveness Yearbook.

In March 2010, the Knesset approved a new Bank of Israel Law which took effect on 1 June 2010. The new law defines the goals of the bank and gives the bank independence in determining its policy tools and the way of implementing them. The law changed the framework in which major decisions are made at the Bank of Israel. Decisions regarding the interest rate and monetary policy, in general, are made by a Monetary Committee, while the managerial decisions are approved by a Supervisory Council. This brings the Bank of Israel more in line with the decision making procedures of other financial institutions.

In 2013, Dr. Karnit Flug was appointed as the governor of the bank. She continued her predecessors&#x27; policies both in deepening monetary control and in integrating Israel into the global economy.

In 2018, Professor Amir Yaron was appointed as the governor of the bank. During his tenure, the Bank of Israel provided approval for the establishment of two new banks in Israel: Bank One Zero and Bank Ash Israel.

== Buildings ==
The current headquarters in Jerusalem was designed by the architecture office of Arieh Sharon and his son, Eldar Sharon. They won the first prize for the project in 1966 and worked at the design until 1974. The building was inaugurated in 1981. The design resembles an inverted pyramid and was inspired by the Boston City Hall. The building underwent a major overhaul and renovation between 2015 and 2018.

<doc id="736053" wikidata="Q755161" url="?curid=736053" title="Third/Sister Lovers">
<text>Third (reissued in 1985 as Third/Sister Lovers) is the third studio album by American rock band Big Star. The sessions started at Ardent Studios in September 1974. Though Ardent created promotional, white-label test pressings for the record in 1975, a combination of financial issues, the uncommercial sound of the record, and lack of interest from singer Alex Chilton and drummer Jody Stephens in continuing the project prevented the album from ever being properly finished or released at the time of its recording. It was eventually released on March 18, 1978, by PVC Records.

After two commercially unsuccessful albums, &quot;Third&quot; documents the band&#x27;s deterioration as well as the declining mental state of singer Alex Chilton. It has since gone on to become a cult album, and was placed at number 449 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2012 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. Its reputation growing with time, the album moved up to number 285 on the magazine&#x27;s 2020 listing. The album is included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Composition and recording==
After the commercial failure of Big Star&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;#1 Record&quot; (1972) and &quot;Radio City&quot; (1974), Alex Chilton and Jody Stephens returned to Ardent Studios in late 1974—accompanied by what biographer Bruce Eaton describes as &quot;a large and revolving cast of Memphis musicians&quot;—to record, under producer Jim Dickinson, &quot;a batch of starkly personal, often experimental, and by turns beautiful and haunting songs that were anything but straight-up power pop.&quot; Ardent&#x27;s John Fry, producer of the first two albums and also involved with the third, recalled that the sessions were burdened by severe personal issues; Eaton tells how Fry &quot;finally called a halt to the escalating madness&quot; and the album was mastered by Larry Nix on February 13, 1975.

Different opinions exist regarding the categorization of &quot;Third&quot; as a Big Star album. According to Chilton, &quot;Jody and I were hanging together as a unit still but we didn&#x27;t see it as a Big Star record. We never saw it as a Big Star record. That was a marketing decision when the record was sold in whatever year that was sold. And they didn&#x27;t ask me anything about it and they never have asked me anything about it.&quot; Stephens said, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen it in different ways. To a great extent it is an Alex solo record ... It&#x27;s Alex&#x27;s focus, it&#x27;s his emotional state of being but I brought in the string section for the one song I wrote and Alex hit it off with Carl Marsh ... and started using Carl and the string section for other things. What would that album have been like if it didn&#x27;t have the strings?&quot; According to Eaton, the mastering card identifies Chilton as the recording artist.

Jovanovic, meanwhile, notes, &quot;Whether the band was still called Big Star is debatable. The session sheets have the band name &#x27;Sister Lovers&#x27; (Chilton and Stephens were dating Lesa and Holliday Aldridge at the time) clearly written on them. This may well have been a joke, although Chilton and Stephens did use the Sister Lovers name for a radio broadcast in early 1975.&quot; Lesa Aldridge, a cousin of photographer and &quot;Radio City&quot; album cover creator William Eggleston, contributed vocals and was, in the words of Dickinson, &quot;a big, big part of the record&quot;. Dickinson said that Chilton, whose relationship with Aldridge was stormy, &quot;reached a point ... where he started to go back and erase her—there was a lot more of Lesa on the album than there is now&quot;. During the sessions, Chilton recalled, &quot;Jim and I did all sorts of weird things ... in off hours here and there&quot;.

Steve Cropper contributed guitar to a cover of The Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;Femme Fatale&quot;, while Eggleston played piano on a cover of eden ahbez&#x27;s &quot;Nature Boy&quot;.

==Release==
In 1978 the tapes were acquired by the PVC label and given their first official release. &quot;Third&quot; was first released by Aura Records in London in 1978. The PVC release in the US came later that year. Numerous reissues by other labels on vinyl and CD would follow, often varying the title, running order, and cover art, as no &#x27;definitive&#x27; version had ever been agreed upon by the band. In addition to the original songs, covers of The Kinks&#x27; &quot;Till the End of the Day&quot;, eden ahbez&#x27;s &quot;Nature Boy&quot; and Jerry Lee Lewis&#x27; &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin&#x27; Goin&#x27; On&quot; were variously included or omitted. The 1992 CD release on Rykodisc, assembled with Jim Dickinson&#x27;s involvement, was regarded as the first attempt at a presentation of the original album concept devised by Dickinson and the band in 1974. In October 2016, Omnivore Recordings released &quot;Complete Third&quot;, a box set that includes every demo, rough mix, outtake, alternate take, and final master from the &quot;Third&quot; sessions ever known to exist.

==Reception==
Like Big Star&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Third/Sister Lovers&quot; did not have commercial success at the time of its release but later attracted wider interest. Reviewing the 1992 reissue, &quot;Newsday&quot; wrote that &quot;Chilton seems determined to undermine the songs with performances that range from incoherent to disengaged... It&#x27;s the sound of a party that has turned sullen.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that &quot;the tension and sense of individual struggle in the album fit comfortably in the tradition of much of the finest—and most liberating—rock.&quot; The &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; deemed the album &quot;a stunning collection of eerie, anxious power pop, strikingly produced.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; determined that &quot;Third/Sister Lovers&quot; &quot;sounds like the soundtrack to a nervous breakdown, with Chilton&#x27;s voice a fragile squeak, the rockers defined by raggedness and others tending to be slow, haunting and often beautiful.&quot;

In AllMusic&#x27;s retrospective review of the album, the website gave it five stars out of five, calling it a &quot;shambling wreck of an album&quot; while at the same time &quot;among the most harrowing experiences in pop music; impassioned, erratic, and stark&quot; and &quot;the slow, sinking sound of a band falling apart&quot;.

===Accolades===
In 1995, the album was ranked at No. 56 in the &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot;″s list of the &quot;Top 100 Alternative Albums&quot;. &quot;Third&quot; was ranked No. 1 in the Top 30 &quot;Heartbreak Albums of All Time&quot; by &quot;NME&quot; in 2000. The album also was featured in 2009 in David Keenan&#x27;s article &quot;The Best Albums Ever...Honest!&quot; in the Scottish newspaper &quot;The Sunday Herald&quot;. 

In 2012, the album was ranked 449th in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and moved up to No. 285 on a subsequently published list in 2020.

&quot;Third&quot; was listed at No. 31 on &quot;NME&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Darkest Albums Ever: 50 of the Best&quot; in 2011.

===Cover versions===
&quot;Kanga Roo&quot; and &quot;Holocaust&quot; were both covered by This Mortal Coil on the band&#x27;s debut LP, &quot;It&#x27;ll End in Tears&quot;. The 1992 Rykodisc CD release of &quot;Third/Sister Lovers&quot; includes a &quot;thank you&quot; to This Mortal Coil in the liner notes in acknowledgment of this. In 1984, the Paisley Underground all-star group Rainy Day covered &quot;Holocaust&quot; on its eponymous album, featuring Kendra Smith of Dream Syndicate on lead vocals. 

&quot;Holocaust&quot; was covered by alternative country band Son Volt on a 1999 promo EP, and is included on the band&#x27;s 2005 compilation &quot;A Retrospective: 1995–2000&quot;. Placebo included its version of &quot;Holocaust&quot; on the &quot;Slave to the Wage&quot; single in 2000 and it can also be found on their compilation album &quot;Covers&quot;. &quot;Take Care&quot; was covered by Yo La Tengo on the 2003 album &quot;Summer Sun&quot;. &quot;Kanga Roo&quot; was included on Jeff Buckley&#x27;s posthumous live album &quot;Mystery White Boy&quot;; another version can be found on the Legacy Edition of his album &quot;Grace&quot; and on &quot;The Grace EPs&quot;. In 2018, The Monkees included &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; on their first full-length holiday release, &quot;Christmas Party&quot;. R.E.M. covered &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; on their 2002 fan club Christmas single, as did The Decemberists on the various artists holiday album &quot;Holidays Rule Vol. 2&quot; from 2017.

<text>Marshall Hall FRS (18 February 1790 – 11 August 1857) was an English physician, physiologist and early neurologist. His name is attached to the theory of reflex arc mediated by the spinal cord, to a method of resuscitation of drowned people, and to the elucidation of function of capillary vessels.

== Biography ==

Hall was born on 18 February 1790 at Basford, near Nottingham, England, where his father, Robert Hall, was a cotton manufacturer. He was a brother of the inventor Samuel Hall. Having attended the Rev. J. Blanchard&#x27;s academy at Nottingham, he entered a chemists shop at Newark-on-Trent, and in 1809 began to study medicine at Edinburgh University. In 1811 he was elected senior president of the Royal Medical Society; the following year he took the M.D. degree, and was immediately appointed resident house physician to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. This appointment he resigned after two years, when he visited Paris and its medical schools, and, on a walking tour, those also of Berlin and Göttingen.

In 1817, when he settled at Nottingham, he published his &quot;Diagnosis&quot;, and in 1818 he wrote the &quot;Mimoses&quot;, a work on the affections denominated bilious, nervous, &amp;c. The next year he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and in 1825 he became physician to the Nottingham general hospital. In 1826 he removed to London, and in the following year he published his &quot;Commentaries on the More Important Diseases of Females&quot;.

In 1835 (Principles of Investigation in Physiology), he outlined five principles to govern animal experimentation.
#An experiment should never be performed if the necessary information could be obtained by observations
#No experiment should be performed without a clearly defined and obtainable, objective
#Scientists should be well-informed about the work of their predecessors and peers to avoid unnecessary repetition of an experiment
#Justifiable experiments should be carried out with the least possible infliction of suffering (often through the use of lower, less sentient animals)
#Every experiment should be performed under circumstances that would provide the clearest possible results, thereby diminishing the need for repetition of experiments.

In 1836 he issued his &quot;Observations on Blood-letting Founded on Researches on the Morbid and Curative Effects of Loss of Blood&quot;, denouncing the widespread practice of bloodletting, which was acknowledged by the medical profession to be of vast practical value, and in 1831 his &quot;Experimental Essay on the Circulation of the Blood in the Capillary Vessels&quot;, in which he was the first to show that the capillaries are intermediate channels between the arteries and the veins and put the blood in contact with biological tissues. In the following year he read before the Royal Society a paper &quot;On the Inverse Ratio which Subsists between Respiration and Irritability in the Animal Kingdom&quot;.

His most important work in physiology was concerned with the theory of reflex action, embodied in a paper &quot;On the Reflex Function of the Medulla Oblongata and the Medulla Spinalis&quot; (1833), which was supplemented in 1837 by another &quot;On the True Spinal Marrow, and the Excito-motor System of Nerves&quot;. In this theory, he stated that the spinal cord is comprised by a chain of units that functions as an independent reflex arcs, and their activity integrates sensory and motor nerves at the segment of the spinal cord from which these nerves originate. He proposed in addition that those arcs are interconnected and interacting in the production of coordinated movement.

The reflex function excited great attention on the continent of Europe, though in England some of his papers were refused publication by the Royal Society. Hall thus became the authority on the multiform deranged states of health referable to an abnormal condition of the nervous system, and he gained a large practice.

Hall also published books on neurological diseases including stroke (apoplexy) and epilepsy.

In &quot;Asphyxia, its Rationale and its Remedy&quot; (1856), Hall developed a technique for preventing victims of drowning by freeing their respiratory airway and by providing immediate ventilation, as the initial steps in resuscitation.

He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1853.

He died at Brighton of a throat infection, aggravated by lecturing, on 11 August 1857 and was buried in Nottingham. One of his grandsons was the musician Marshall Hall. 

== Religious views ==
Hall was a devout Christian who believed in the divinity of Christ. A collection of his religious thoughts on his journals and letters was collected by his widow in the biographical book &quot;Memoirs of Marshall Hall, by his widow&quot;. There, he is quoted speaking about Christ:
In his treatise &quot;On the diseases and derangements of the nervous system&quot; (1841), he evoked the design argument, stating about the physiological activity of the body:
== Abolitionism ==
Hall was also an abolitionist. When he travelled to the United States, in his later years, he was shocked by what he saw, and was shocked at how slavery was sanctioned in the States. An admirer of William Wilberforce, he wrote &quot;The two-fold slavery of the United States; with a project of self-emancipation&quot; (1854), where he denounced the slave system and spoke about &quot;a second slavery&quot; of racial prejudice. He set then his opinion on slavery, stating:
In his book, he proposed as project of emancipation that African-American people continue to produce cotton, sugar and rice, but to freely help and prosper themselves. On the same religious grounds, he questioned the permission of polygamy in the US and insisted that imposing the slavery system and denying marriage to black people was a sin which caused a &quot;deprivation of education, of holy marriage, of parental rights&quot;.:
He believed that every slaveholder had a &quot;guilt of sin against God, and of sin against his fellow-man&quot; and insisted that there was no credible hypothesis to rationally support white supremacy, stating:

<text>The Hulihee Palace is located in historic Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, on Ali&#x27;i Drive. The former vacation home of Hawaiian royalty, it was converted to a museum run by the Daughters of Hawaii, showcasing furniture and artifacts. It is located at 75–5718 Alii Drive, Kailua-Kona.

==History==

The palace was originally built out of lava rock by John Adams Kuakini (governor of the island of Hawaii) during the Hawaiian Kingdom. When he died in 1844 he left it to his &quot;hānai&quot; (adopted) son William Pitt Leleiohoku I, the son of Prime Minister William Pitt Kalanimoku. Leleiohoku died in the measles epidemic of 1848 and left it to his son John William Pitt Kīnaʻu, but he died young and the palace went to his mother Princess Ruth Keʻelikōlani. Ruth made Hulihee her chief residence for most of her life, but she preferred to sleep in a grass hut on the palace grounds rather than in the palace. She invited all of the reigning monarchs to vacation at Hulihee, from Kamehameha III to Liliʻuokalani. Ruth died and left the palace to her cousin and sole heir Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop.

It was later sold to King Kalākaua and Queen Kapiolani. Kalākaua renamed the palace &quot;Hikulani Hale&quot;, which means “House of the Seventh ruler,” referring to himself, the seventh monarch of the monarchy that began with King Kamehameha I. In 1885, King Kalākaua had the palace plastered over the outside to give the building a more refined appearance. After Kalākaua&#x27;s death it passed to Kapiolani who left Hulihee Palace to her two nephews, Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole Piʻikoi and Prince David Kawānanakoa. In 1927 the Daughters of Hawaii, a group dedicated to preserving the cultural legacy of the Hawaiian Islands, restored Hulihee Palace and turned it into a museum. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii in 1973 as site 73000653.

The palace&#x27;s walls and ceiling had slight cracks following the 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake that was centered on the Kohala coast.

<text>The Tillamook River is a stream, about long, near the coast of northwest Oregon in the United States. It drains an oceanside valley in the foothills of the Northern Oregon Coast Range west of Portland and empties into the Pacific Ocean via Tillamook Bay. It is one of five rivers—the Tillamook, the Trask, the Wilson, the Kilchis, and the Miami—that flow into the bay.

Rising in southern Tillamook County about east of Cape Lookout, it flows initially east, then generally north, through a long broadening farming valley, passing west of Tillamook and entering the south end of Tillamook Bay. For its lower , it shares a channel with the Trask River.

Although much of the upper watershed of about is forested, much of the lower valley consists of drained pasture land.

==Tributaries==
Named tributaries from source to mouth are Mills, Munson, Joe, Simmons, Fawcett, Killam, and Bewley creeks. Then come Sutton, Beaver, Anderson, Fagan, Esther, Tomlinson, Memaloose, and Dick creeks.

<text>The Wilno Voivodeship () was one of 16 Voivodeships in the Second Polish Republic, with the capital in Wilno (now Vilnius, Lithuania). The jurisdiction was created in 1926 and populated predominantly by Poles, with notable minorities of Belarusians, Jews and Lithuanians. Before 1926, the voivodeship&#x27;s area was known as the Wilno Land; it had the same boundaries and was also within the contemporary borders of Poland at the time.

The total area of Wilno Voivodeship was , with a population of 1.276 million. Following the German and Soviet invasion of Poland and the reshaping of Europe, Poland&#x27;s borders were redrawn at the insistence of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin at the Tehran Conference. Wilno Voivodeship was incorporated into the Lithuanian and the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republics. Many of the ethnic Polish population were forcibly resettled at the end of World War II. Since 1991, the former territory of the voivodeship is now part of sovereign Lithuania and sovereign Belarus.

==History==

=== Background ===
After the Third Partition of Poland–Lithuania in 1795, the Vilnius region, like most of Grand Duchy of Lithuania, was occupied by the Russian Empire until World War I. Russian rule in the region was unstable as evidenced by the French invasion of Russia, the Uprisings of 1831 and 1863. In the aftermath of World War I and Russia&#x27;s internal weakness due to the Russian Civil War, Lithuania and Poland re-established their independence. However, the Polish–Lithuanian War began as a result of conflict between the two countries. In October 1920, Józef Piłsudski, Poland&#x27;s Chief of State, in order to circumvent the Treaty of Suvalkai, which left Vilnius on the Lithuanian side, organized Żeligowski&#x27;s Mutiny, to seize Vilnius for Poland. In this false flag operation, the Polish goals of taking over Vilnius were achieved and the Polish puppet state of Central Lithuania was created. In 1922, after a disputed election to the Vilnius Sejm, the parliament voted to incorporate Central Lithuania into the Second Polish Republic.

=== 1920s and 1930s ===
From 6 April 1922 to 20 January 1926, the territory was known as the Wilno Land (). Wilno Voivodeship was created on 20 January 1926 from the territories of the Wilno Land. On 1 April 1927, Mołodeczno county and was created from parts of Wilejka (5 gminas), Oszmiana (1 gmina), Wołożyń (1 gmina) and Stołpce (1 gmina) countries. On 1 April 1929, Mołodeczno county&#x27;s was dissolved and was bound to of . The same day, and gminas of Postawy were dissolved and passed to and gminas and of , Wierzchnie gmina of Dzisna was dissolved and passed to , of was dissolved and was passed to of . It was formed as the last of the Polish voivodeships in the interbellum. (The Sandomierz Voivodeship was supposed to be created in late 1939, but never was).

=== World War II ===
Following the Soviet invasion in 1939, the Wilno Voivodeship was divided between the newly created Vileyka Voblast of the Byelorussian SSR and independent Lithuania (from 1940 this was known as the Lithuanian SSR). This division was not internationally accepted. The Polish government-in-exile nominated Zygmunt Fedorowicz in 1942 as its representative for Wilno region. He was arrested by the NKVD in 1944.

Currently the former territory of Wilno Voivodeship is divided between the Vilnius and Utena counties in Lithuania and the Grodno, Minsk and Vitebsk Regions of Belarus.

==Location==
The Wilno Voivodeship had an area of 29,011 km2 (which made it the fourth biggest Polish Voivodeship) and a population (according to the Polish census of 1931) of 1,276,000.

The Voivodeship was located in the country&#x27;s northeastern corner, bordering the Soviet Union to the east, Lithuania to the west, Latvia to the north, Nowogródek Voivodeship to the south and Białystok Voivodeship to the south-west. The landscape was flat and hilly in parts, with several lakes (such as Narocz, the biggest lake in interwar Poland). As of 1 January 1937, 21.2% of the area was forested (compared to the national average of 22.2%).

== Towns and administrative division ==
Wilno Voivodeship was created after the territory of the Republic of Central Lithuania was merged with the so-called Wilno Area. In the years 1922–1939 it was divided into 9 powiats (counties):

In 1931, the biggest city of the Voivodeship (and the biggest in northeastern Poland) was Wilno, with 195 100 inhabitants. Apart from this city, Voivodeship was sparsely populated and lacked more urban centres. All other towns were very small, none of them reached a population larger than 10 000 (as of 1931).

==Population==

According to the Polish census of 1931 the Voivodeship was inhabited by 1,276,000 people. Majority of population was Polish (59.7% claimed Polish as their native tongue). Among minorities there were: Belarusians (22.7%), Jews (8.5%), Lithuanians (5.5%) and Russians (3.4%). The population density was 44 persons per km2 (second lowest in Poland, after Polesie Voivodeship). The census has been criticized as inaccurate due to bias against the Belarusians and Lithuanians.

Following the Polish territorial changes after World War II, a significant part of the Polish population was repatriated to the newly formed People&#x27;s Republic of Poland as Wilno Voivodeship was split and incorporated into the Lithuanian and Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republics. Many encountered difficulties in the repatriation process and were prevented from leaving. The Polish population that remained in Lithuania was subjected to attempts at Lithuanization (in the 1950s), which were thwarted by Moscow, and to Russification and Sovietization policies.
==Industry and transport==
Wilno Voivodeship was located in the so-called Poland &quot;B&quot;, which meant that it was still underdeveloped, apart from the city of Wilno. A large part of the population was poor, with a high level of illiteracy (in 1931, 29.1% was illiterate, with the national average of 23.1%). Railway network was scarce, with only a few junctions - the most important one at Wilno, also at Molodeczno, and Nowa Wilejka. The total length of railroads within Voivodeship&#x27;s boundaries was 1,097 kilometres, which was only 3.8 per 100 km2.

Elektrit Radiotechnical Society was the largest privately owned company in Wilno. With over 1,100 workers, the society produced around 50,000 radio receivers annually.

<doc id="736088" wikidata="Q610817" url="?curid=736088" title="Banco do Brasil">
<text>Banco do Brasil S.A. (, ) is a Brazilian financial services company headquartered in Brasília, Brazil. The oldest bank in Brazil, and among the oldest banks in continuous operation in the world, it was founded by John VI, King of Portugal, on Wednesday, 12 October 1808. It is the second largest banking institution in Brazil, as well as the second largest in Latin America. Banco do Brasil is controlled by the Brazilian government and is listed at the B3 stock exchange in São Paulo.

It has been one of the four most profitable Brazilian banks since 2000 (along with Itaú Unibanco, Banco Bradesco and Banco Santander) and holds a strong leadership position in retail banking.

==History==
Banco do Brasil was founded in 1808 by then prince regent John (later King John VI of Portugal) to finance the kingdom&#x27;s public debt when he moved from Europe to Brazil. &quot;As a mixed institution under state control, the Banco do Brasil served as a commercial bank, the government&#x27;s fiscal agent, and Brazil&#x27;s first bank of issue.&quot; It went bankrupt two times in history: once during independence in 1821, when John VI returned to Portugal taking with him some of the bank&#x27;s assets, and a second time in 1898.

From 1821 to 1964 Banco do Brasil occasionally performed tasks that exceeded its role as a traditional commercial bank: issuing currency, having the monopoly of currency exchange transactions and serving as National Treasury holder for the government. Such tasks were gradually given to other governmental institutions, mainly with the creation of the Central Bank of Brazil in 1964 and the separation from the National Treasury in 1987.

From 1992 onwards it was restructured as a commercial bank, using its huge geographic distribution and credit assets to leverage its redesign as a &quot;normal&quot; bank. In the process, tens of thousands of workers were laid off.

After decades of losses due to being used to finance some of the Brazilian Federal Government public policies, the bank became very profitable across the years. The bank is one of the key structures used by Brazilian government to restabilize the market (like preventing cartelizations in the bank interest market or stabilizing the bank credit during financial distress times like the 2008–2009 global crisis). The institution also is used to finance public programs such as the DRS – Sustainable Regional Development initiatives.

In November 2013, &quot;The Banker&quot; ranked Banco de Brasil as the top bank in Brazil based on Tier 1 capital.

==Branding==
The current logo has been in use since the 1960s, when the standard colors changed from brown and yellow to blue-grey-and yellow. The blue and yellow mimic the colors of the Brazilian flag.

Since the early 1980s, the bank has sponsored several sports competitions (in sports such as beach soccer, volleyball, tennis, table tennis, futsal, sailing, motorsport and beach volleyball). It is the official sponsor for Robert Scheidt, Gustavo Kuerten, Enzo Fittipaldi, Pietro Fittipaldi, and the Brazilian national beach soccer, volleyball, and futsal teams.

The bank also sponsors other cultural events such as plays through its organization CCBB (Centro Cultural Banco do Brasil) and amateur sports through the AABB (Associação Atlética Banco do Brasil).

Supermodel Gisele Bündchen was chosen to be the face of their first global ad campaign in 2012.

In April 2023, Banco do Brasil raised US$750 million through its first issuance of sustainability bonds. Whose resources should be used exclusively in projects with sustainable purposes, aligned with ESG policies.

==Services==
In addition to commercial and government services, the bank offers a large variety of services to the consumer including bill payment services (Boleto), ATM loans, and a single package that contains the account numbers for checking, multiple savings accounts, and investment account. The account holder may apply for international MasterCard and Visa debit cards which act as both a credit card on a loan account, and as a debit card on the checking account (a little different from the arrangement in many other countries, where both the debit and credit functions of a debit card act on the checking account). The list of services offered encompass many complex automatic functions from ATMs and online such as a wide variety of loans, automatic payments, Brazilian bill payments, and deposits to other Brazilian accounts. Many merchants routinely accept account-to-account transfers as payment for goods.

==International users==
Banco do Brasil has a few branches in the United States (Washington, Miami) and other countries. These branches are intended for use by large companies and for permanent residents of Brasil who visit the other countries, but they also offer regular services for residents of the countries where they are located.

Banco do Brasil has been expanding its international presence and currently has more than 44 points of service abroad, divided into branches, sub-branches, business units / offices and subsidiaries.

==Interest rates==
Interest rates on loans vary to a great extent but, being a public-owned bank that operates as a commercial venture, Banco do Brasil is not noted for having the highest, or the lowest rates either.

==Relationship with the government==
Traditionally the CEO is appointed by the Brazilian president but usually picked from a list of career directors. A few CEOs were taken from outside the financial industry.

Banco do Brasil has the monopoly of a number of government funding programs, like Pronaf (National Subsistence Farming Support), DRS, Fome Zero (zero hunger), PASEP, and others, and is the bank of choice for most municipal and state governments.

==Hiring process==
Being publicly-owned, Banco do Brasil must recruit employees through a public selection process, called the &quot;concurso público&quot;, who must work strictly according to business norms. Due to the high standards and job security that the &quot;concurso público&quot; compels, a position with the Banco do Brasil is highly desirable in Brazil. The hiring process is conducted separately for each region of Brazil, with approved candidates recruited to any branch in the region. Candidates must be Brazilian nationals (or legal, naturalized residents) and must have completed military and electoral registration obligations (military service is mandatory for men, and voter registration is mandatory for all Brazilians aged 18 to 70).

Banco do Brasil maintains 49 offices/places of business in 23 different countries and, depending on local law, may employ local hires. For instance, the Miami Branch and the North America Regional Office (BBUSA) hire locally.

Local hires must pass a competitive test, speak multiple languages, and demonstrate a knowledge of finance, economics, computer sciences, business administration and asset management, trade, structured and project finance, etc. Prior work experience is fundamental.

Other publicly-owned Brazilian banks, like the Caixa Econômica Federal, Banco da Amazônia, and Banco do Nordeste, maintain similar processes, but the Banco do Brasil&#x27;s &quot;concurso público&quot; sets the gold standard for Brazilian public service employment.

==Sponsorships==
Banco do Brasil is an official sponsor of the Brazil national volleyball team and had a long-running association with Brazilian racing driver Felipe Nasr and were the title sponsor of his team, Sauber. The bank were also previously sponsored by Brawn GP.

Currently, Banco do Brasil sponsors the brothers Enzo Fittipaldi, Formula 2 driver for Charouz, and Pietro Fittipaldi, Haas F1 Team reserve driver

<doc id="736094" wikidata="Q44396" url="?curid=736094" title="Moonwalker">
<text>Moonwalker is a 1988 American experimental anthology musical film starring Michael Jackson. Rather than featuring one continuous narrative, the film expresses the influence of fandom and innocence through a collection of short films about Jackson, several of which are long-form music videos from Jackson&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Bad&quot;. The film is named after the dance technique known as the moonwalk, which Jackson was known for performing.

The film was released theatrically in Europe and South America, but Warner Bros. canceled plans for a Christmas 1988 theatrical release in the United States. &quot;Moonwalker&quot; was released on VHS, and remained #1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Video Chart for 22 weeks. &quot;Moonwalker&quot; also spent 14 weeks at #1 on Billboards Top Video- Cassette sales chart In 1989, &quot;Moonwalker&quot; was honoured with a certification of 800,000 copies sold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Moonwalker has been certified 9 x Platinum in the United Kingdom.

The &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; video aired as a separate entity and won a Grammy in 1990 for Best Music Video, Short Form, which is the only Grammy Award Jackson received for the album &quot;Bad&quot;. &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; video also won the Cannes Gold Lion Award for Best Special Effects.

==Summary==

The film&#x27;s segments are connected by an underlying but overall narrative meant to represent the different stages in Jackson&#x27;s career and were based on his own view of how his fans idolized him rather than listening to the messages he wanted to say with his music.

===&quot;Man in the Mirror&quot;===
The first segment of Moonwalker is a live performance of &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; during his Bad World Tour in Europe and America. Clips from Met Center in Minneapolis among others can be seen. It also features a montage of clips of children in Africa, Martin Luther King Jr., Mother Teresa, Mahatma Gandhi, Desmond Tutu, Jesus Christ, kids in graduation, and other historical figures.

===&quot;Retrospective&quot;===
The second segment is a 10-minute biographical film about Jackson, covering the early years from the Jackson 5 until the Bad World Tour.

The songs in order of appearance are:&lt;br&gt;1. &quot;Music and Me&quot;&lt;br&gt;2. &quot;I Want You Back&quot;&lt;br&gt;3. &quot;ABC&quot;&lt;br&gt;4. &quot;The Love You Save&quot;&lt;br&gt;5. &quot;2-4-6-8&quot;&lt;br&gt;6. &quot;Who&#x27;s Lovin&#x27; You&quot;&lt;br&gt;7. &quot;Ben&quot;&lt;br&gt;8. &quot;Dancing Machine&quot;&lt;br&gt;9. &quot;Blame It on the Boogie&quot;&lt;br&gt;10. &quot;Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)&quot;&lt;br&gt;11. &quot;Rock with You&quot;&lt;br&gt;12. &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop &#x27;Til You Get Enough&quot;&lt;br&gt;13. &quot;Can You Feel It&quot;&lt;br&gt;14. &quot;Human Nature&quot;&lt;br&gt;15. &quot;Beat It&quot;&lt;br&gt;16. &quot;Thriller&quot;&lt;br&gt;17. &quot;Billie Jean&quot;&lt;br&gt;18. &quot;State of Shock&quot;&lt;br&gt;19. &quot;We Are the World&quot;&lt;br&gt;20. &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot;&lt;br&gt;21. &quot;Dirty Diana&quot;

===&quot;Badder&quot;===
The third segment is a parody of the music video for &quot;Bad&quot;″s title song, featuring children filling the roles of various people from the original clip. The video stars Brandon Quintin Adams (who also appears in the &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; segment) as the young Michael Jackson. It also featured three of Michael&#x27;s nephews Jermaine La Jaune Jackson, Jr. along with TJ and Taryll Jackson and a young Nikki Cox. The singing group The Boys appeared as background dancers. Ingrid Dupree of the Kidsongs kids also appear in this segment.

===&quot;Speed Demon&quot;===
The fourth segment begins with the &quot;Badder&quot; short film transitioning into the second short film, &quot;Speed Demon&quot;, produced by Claymation innovator Will Vinton. A portion of the clip is set to Jackson&#x27;s song &quot;Speed Demon&quot;. After filming &quot;Badder&quot;, Little Michael and his bodyguards (also young kids) are leaving the set and walk through a cloud of smoke and come out as their regular adult age. As he exits the set, he is spotted by tourists and they suddenly begin to chase him for an autograph. In an attempt to avoid the overzealous fans and the interviewers (including camera-happy Japanese tourists accompanied by stereotyped &quot;Oriental&quot; music, the press, and even The Noid) plus some gunslingers (after stumbling upon the filming of a Western helmed by a director resembling Steven Spielberg), Jackson soon disguises himself as a rabbit named Spike, using a costume from one of the film sets (imbued with animatronic properties using Claymation, giving a similar combined-media effect as &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, but with more obvious bluescreening).

Michael taunts the fans into chasing him, once they realize it is him. Michael steals a bicycle which then turns into a motorcycle once he hits the highway in order to flee, with the fans and the paparazzi (now also appearing in Claymation form) giving chase in various other, more cartoonish vehicles. During the chase, he morphs into other celebrities, namely Sylvester Stallone, Tina Turner and Pee-wee Herman, with the bike also briefly morphing (into a jackhammer, stop sign, waterski, and jet pack) in repeatedly unsuccessful attempts to throw the fans off.

After a long chase, the fans/press are finally thwarted by crashing into a giant (Claymation) cop and are arrested. Jackson finally then manages to escape and rides off to a desert. He takes off his rabbit costume and it then suddenly comes to life and challenges him to an extended dance-off. In the end, a passing traffic cop interrupts Jackson to point out he is in a &quot;No Dancing Zone&quot;, and when Michael turns to show him that he was competing with the rabbit, he sees that the rabbit has disappeared. The cop then sarcastically asks for Jackson&#x27;s autograph (as opposed to &quot;signature&quot;) on the ticket. Just as Jackson is preparing to leave, the rabbit&#x27;s head materializes on a nearby rocky crag, which then nods to him and smiles.

===&quot;Leave Me Alone&quot;===
The fifth segment of the film is a surreal animated music video for the song &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot;, focusing on supermarket tabloid interest in Jackson&#x27;s personal life. It compares Jackson&#x27;s life to an amusement park, and how his fans just see him as such. It is meant to point out, in a mocking tone, the way the tabloids unnecessarily sensationalized his life with claims that he had a shrine to Elizabeth Taylor and bought the Elephant Man&#x27;s bones. In the video, Jackson&#x27;s life is portrayed as a circus due to the press&#x27;s manipulation and the everyday tug-of-war he endured as an artist. His beloved then-pet chimp Bubbles makes a cameo appearance as Jackson is seen picking him up and riding with him in his roller coaster car. His pet snake, Muscles, is also present. The press is portrayed with dog heads to insinuate that they are like animals. The segment ends with Jackson destroying the park, and looking off into space.

===&quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;===
The segment begins with three orphans (Sean, Katie, and Zeke) sneaking through a big city to see their friend Michael going out for the evening. As Michael stands in front of the door, he notices a falling star before he is ambushed by men with machine guns. The film then backtracks to show Michael and the children playing in a meadow in happier times.

As they are playing, their dog Skipper runs away, and as Michael and Katie look for him, they uncover the lair of Frankie Lideo (the last name was an alternate spelling of the last name of Jackson&#x27;s then-manager Frank Dileo), a.k.a. Mr. Big, a drug-dealing mobster with an army of henchmen. Leading an operation called &quot;Bugs and Drugs,&quot; he wants to get the entire population of Earth addicted to drugs, starting with children. As Mr. Big continues work on his operation, he discovers that Michael and Katie are spying on him.

The story returns to the ambush in front of Michael&#x27;s apartment. Unknown to the gangsters, Michael wished on the falling star and escaped the gunfire, leaving only his overcoat. Upon realizing he has escaped again, Mr. Big orders his henchmen to track down Michael with dogs. He is eventually cornered in an alley, where he wishes on another falling star and turns into a Lancia Stratos Zero sports car that mows down several of Mr. Big&#x27;s henchmen. Michael is pursued through the city streets until he loses the henchmen.

Meanwhile, the children scout out Club 30s, where Michael had told them to meet him, and find only an abandoned nightclub. As Jackson arrives, Katie sees a silhouette of him turning back from a car into himself. The door of the club opens with a gust of wind, and Michael walks in to find it filled with men in suits and swing dancers. The children gather outside a window of the club and watch Michael dance to &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;. Mr. Big lays siege to the club and kidnaps Katie.

Michael follows them back to Big&#x27;s lair and ends up surrounded by his henchmen. Mr. Big appears and taunts Michael by threatening to inject Katie with highly addictive narcotics. While Katie manages to wriggle free, Mr. Big decides he has had enough and orders his men to kill Katie first then finish off Jackson, just as a falling star passes by. Michael transforms into a giant robot and kills most of Mr. Big&#x27;s soldiers, then turns into a spaceship. Mr. Big gets into a large hillside-mounted energy cannon, firing on the spaceship knocking it into a nearby ravine. The children are his next target, but the spaceship returns from the ravine in time to fire a beam in the cannon with Mr. Big inside, destroying it and finishing the villain once and for all. The children watch the ship fly into the night sky with a shower of light.

===&quot;Come Together&quot;===
In the conclusion to &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;, Sean, Katie and Zeke return to the city, believing that Michael is gone forever. As the boys talk about Michael, Katie walks away crying and clutching a paper star. As she sits in a corner wishing for him to come back, the paper star flies out of her hand and Michael walks out of the night fog. He takes them back to &quot;Club 30&#x27;s&quot;, where they find that the club has turned into the backstage area of a concert. Michael&#x27;s stage crew return the children&#x27;s missing dog and then escort Michael onto the stage where he performs a cover of The Beatles song &quot;Come Together&quot; with the children watching and cheering him on from backstage.

===Closing credits===
During the closing credits, two more segments are shown. The first has Ladysmith Black Mambazo performing &quot;The Moon is Walking&quot; in Club 30&#x27;s amidst behind-the-scenes clips. The second is a selection of slowed-down and sped-up clips from the &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; segment, which was also used as an alternate music video to the song.

==Release==
The release of &quot;Moonwalker&quot; was originally scheduled to coincide with Jackson&#x27;s 1987 album, &quot;Bad&quot;. During the theatrical release of &quot;Moonwalker&quot;, Jackson was also embarking on the Bad World Tour, his first tour as a solo performer. The film was released theatrically in Europe and South America, but Warner Bros. canceled plans for a Christmas 1988 theatrical release in the United States. &quot;Moonwalker&quot; was instead released on home video by CMV Enterprises in the United States and Canada on January 10, 1989, just as the Bad World Tour finished. (His tour was supposed to finish sooner, but had been postponed due to some vocal strain, so it went on until the last week of January 1989.) The video had sold more than 800,000 copies in the United States by April 17, 1989.

===Critical reception===
The film received mixed reviews. Critics praised the music though complained that there was no plot and that it seemed like a series of music videos tied together. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that &quot;Moonwalker&quot; &quot;seems unsure of what it was supposed to be. At the center of the pic is the &#x27;Smooth Criminal&#x27; segment, a musical/dramatic piece full of dancing, schmaltzy kids, sci-fi effects and blazing machine guns (directed by Academy Award winner Colin Chilvers, based on a story by Jackson). Around it are really just numerous Jackson music videos with little or no linkage. Although quite enjoyable the whole affair does not make for a structured or professional movie.&quot;

==Legacy and awards==
&quot;Moonwalker&quot; was released on VHS, and remained #1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Video Chart for 22 weeks. &quot;Moonwalker&quot; also spent 14 weeks at #1 on Billboards Top Video- Cassette sales chart The Video Software Dealer&#x27;s Association awarded Jackson with an award for &quot;Moonwalker&quot; in 1989.

In 1989, &quot;Moonwalker&quot; was honoured with a certification of 800,000 copies sold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Moonwalker has been certified 9 x Platinum in the United Kingdom.

The &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; video aired as a separate entity and won a Grammy in 1990 for Best Music Video, Short Form, which is the only Grammy Award Jackson received for the album &quot;Bad&quot;. &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; video also won the Cannes Gold Lion Award for Best Special Effects.

The film had a limited theatrical release and was released in the United States on VHS and LaserDisc. The vignettes featured in the movie also appear in a DVD box set of Michael Jackson music videos titled &quot;Michael Jackson&#x27;s Vision&quot;. The set only features the song and dance sequences from &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;, the title song, and the ending &quot;Come Together&quot; as opposed to the entire short film.

&quot;Moonwalker&quot; was released on a region-free Blu-ray in the United Kingdom in June 2010 by Warner Bros. This Blu-ray version contained a new remastered transfer and a DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. The release has been censored, with the scenes of Mr. Big hitting Katie and threatening to inject her with heroin cut from the film. The Blu-ray was released in its original theatrical 16:9 aspect ratio, different from the previous 4:3 home releases.

&quot;Moonwalker&quot; has yet to be officially released on DVD and/or Blu-ray in North America. The film is available to buy worldwide exclusively on the Amazon Prime Video streaming service, which is the version from the 2010 Blu-Ray disc release.

===Video games===

&quot;Moonwalker&quot; was first adapted in game form to various home computers by British developer U.S. Gold. This top-down action game followed the segments of the film and bore little resemblance to the latter, more popular games developed by Sega with Michael Jackson&#x27;s cooperation.

&quot;Moonwalker&quot; was developed into an arcade video game by Sega with the help of Jackson, which was released on the Sega System 18 hardware. A distinct adaptation was also developed for the Genesis/Mega Drive and Master System consoles. The console versions of the game were actually based on an evolved version of the side-scrolling Sega Mega Drive &quot;Shinobi&quot; series engine, while the arcade version was a three-quarters beat &#x27;em up.

Both the console and arcade versions are based on the &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; segment of the film, following Michael in suit and fedora through stages based on his different music videos as he rescues children from the drug dealer Mr. Big. In the three-player simultaneous arcade game, contact with Bubbles, Michael&#x27;s chimp, transformed him into a robot warrior, replacing Michael&#x27;s &quot;star magic&quot; and melee dance attacks with missiles and laser beams. In the console versions on certain levels, rescuing a certain child first would trigger a comet to fall from the sky that could be grabbed transforming Michael into the robot (which could fly with a rocket pack as well as using lasers and a missile special attack). Michael automatically changes into a robot for the final showdown with Mr. Big&#x27;s henchmen and finally into a space ship for the last battle, in a sort of flight-sim shooter in the Genesis version. All incarnations of the game featured the ability of Michael to use some form of &quot;Dance Magic&quot; which would force his enemies to dance to the music of various tunes from &quot;Bad&quot; or &quot;Thriller&quot; and be destroyed as a result.

In North America, the game had a successful launch. It was the top-grossing new video game on the &quot;RePlay&quot; arcade charts in September 1990.

The game received a positive review from &quot;RePlay&quot; magazine.

===Comic===
In 1989, Blackthorne Publishing adapted the film into a comic book, &quot;Moonwalker 3-D&quot; (# 75 in &quot;Blackthorne&#x27;s 3-D Series&quot;). This title, illustrated by Abel Laxamana was a major contributing factor in the demise of Blackthorne, since the publisher had to pay a large licensing fee for the property, and when the comic flopped, they experienced a large financial loss. Blackthorne ceased its operations in 1990.

===Toys===
In 2014, Bandai released an S.H. Figuarts figure of Jackson in his &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; outfit.

<doc id="736121" wikidata="Q4644009" url="?curid=736121" title="7th Division (Australia)">
<text>The 7th Division was an infantry division of the Australian Army. It was formed in February 1940 to serve in World War II, as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF). The division was raised on the British establishment of nine infantry battalions per division and consisted of two new brigades and three of the original 12 battalions of the 6th Division forming the third brigade. The division is sometimes known by the nickname &quot;The Silent Seventh&quot;, due to a perception that its achievements were unrecognised, in comparison to the other Australian divisions. The origin of this belief appears to be censorship of the part played by the 7th Division in the fierce fighting in the 1941 Syria-Lebanon campaign. The 7th Division along with the 6th and 9th Australian Divisions were the only divisions to serve in both the Middle East and the South West Pacific Area. It was disbanded in 1946, following the end of the war.

==History==
===Formation===
The 7th Division was the second division raised as part of the 2nd AIF following the outbreak of World War II. Approval for the formation of the new division was granted on 28 February 1940 and on 4 April its first commanding officer, Major General John Lavarack, was appointed. Upon formation the division consisted of three infantry brigades: the 19th, 20th and 21st. Of these, the 19th was formed in Palestine and the other two were formed in Australia. In June 1940, however, the 19th Brigade was replaced in the division by the 18th Brigade, which was then based in the United Kingdom where they were undertaking garrison duties to defend against a possible invasion of that country by the Germans following the Fall of France as part of the 6th Division. This was short lived, however, for the following month the division lost the 18th Brigade and gained the 26th Brigade which was still forming in Australia. This enabled the division to undertake training together prior to embarking for the Middle East in October 1940. In February 1941 further changes in the division&#x27;s composition occurred. The 20th and 26th Brigades were transferred to the 9th Division and in exchange the division received the 18th and 25th Brigades.

===North Africa and Middle East===
On arrival in the Middle East the division undertook training in Palestine and Egypt before the 18th Brigade was sent to capture an Italian position at Giarabub. The main assault was undertaken by the 2/9th Battalion on 21 March, although a company from the 2/10th and machine-gunners from the 2/12th provided support. For the loss of 15 killed and 71 wounded, the Australians captured the fortress along with 36 artillery pieces. In April, the 18th Brigade moved from Alexandria to Tobruk, where they later played a successful defensive role in the Siege of Tobruk, from May to August 1941. In the actions around Tobruk, the division suffered 135 killed, 507 wounded and 29 captured.

Meanwhile, the rest of the 7th Division formed the backbone of the Allied invasion of Lebanon and Syria; with British, Indian, Free French and Czechoslovakian forces defeating Vichy French land forces in the Middle East in June and July. Starting on 8 June, the division advanced along two main axes: the 21st Brigade moving along the coast road from Tyre, crossing the Litani and moving towards Sidon, while the 25th Brigade advanced to the east from Metula towards Merdajayoun and Jezzine. Both brigades advanced in two columns. The initial phase of the attack came to an end on 15 June when the Vichy French launched a counterattack, striking at Merdjayoun and recapturing it and Fort Khiam. On 21 June, the 2/25th Battalion entered Damascus and Fort Khiam and its adjacent village, were re-occupied by the Australians. By 30 June the Australians had recaptured the initiative and the 7th Division handed over the central sector to the British. Following this, the division concentrated around Jezzine before advancing towards Damour. Once this was captured, the division continued on towards Beirut, which fell on 12 July.

In mid-July an armistice came into effect and the division was employed on garrison duties along the coastal zone, headquartered in Tripoli. The 18th Brigade rejoined the division in September, taking up defensive positions around Aleppo, to defend against a possible invasion by German forces through Turkey.

During the campaign, two 7th Division personnel earned the Victoria Cross. Lieutenant Arthur Roden Cutler, of the 2/5th Field Regiment, received the decoration for his exploits in June at Merdjayoun and in early July in the Damour area where he was seriously wounded. Corporal Jim Gordon, of the 2/31st Battalion, was the second recipient of the campaign. The division&#x27;s casualties in Syria and Lebanon included 305 killed, 796 wounded and 90 captured.

===New Guinea===
In December 1941, as Japanese forces advanced rapidly in Southeast Asia, it was decided that the 6th and 7th Divisions were needed to defend Australia. In early January 1942, the division moved from Syria, where they had been undertaking garrison duties, to Palestine. On 30 January elements of the division embarked upon transport ships, including the at Suez to begin the journey back to Australia as part of Operation Stepsister. Spread across five convoys, the division&#x27;s return was staggered. At this time, the British government requested that the division be sent to Burma to help stem the tide of the Japanese advance on Rangoon, but the Australian government declined the request.

Nevertheless, elements of the division, consisting mainly of men from the 2/3rd Machine Gun Battalion, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion, and the 2/6th Field Company, as well as some transport and medic personnel, on the transport &quot;Orcades&quot; were diverted to Java, and fought alongside Dutch forces there, but were soon overwhelmed. Of these men, four were killed, while 206 became prisoners of war. The bulk of the division went straight to Australia, however, arriving in Adelaide in mid-March 1942. The following month, the division was moved to New South Wales where personnel were given a brief period of leave before moving on to Queensland. There they undertook defensive duties and training in light of the perceived threat of Japanese invasion. In April, the division was assigned to I Corps, First Army. In August, as the situation in New Guinea worsened, the decision was made to deploy the 7th Division. The 21st Brigade, under Brigadier Arnold Potts, was dispatched to Port Moresby, from where they would advance to help reinforce the units of the Militia, including the 39th Battalion, which were fighting a rearguard action on the Kokoda Track.

Simultaneously, the 18th Brigade, under the command of Brigadier George Wootten was sent to Milne Bay. Along with the 7th Brigade (a Militia formation), Royal Australian Air Force planes and ground staff, and a US engineer regiment, they successfully defended an airfield at the eastern tip of Papua from a major assault by Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces. The fighting came to be known as the Battle of Milne Bay, and was the first outright defeat of Japanese land forces in World War II. Corporal John French, from the 2/9th Battalion, was awarded a posthumous VC for his actions on 4 September 1942. The division&#x27;s casualties at Milne Bay were 126 killed and 182 wounded.

Meanwhile, the Kokoda Track campaign had become a vicious, see-sawing battle, featuring fierce fighting around Kokoda itself and at Isurava where Private Bruce Kingsbury, from the 2/14th Battalion, was awarded a posthumous VC for his actions on 29 August. The Australians withdrew from Isurava, taking part in further actions around Templeton&#x27;s Crossing and Efogi. The 25th Brigade joined the 21st at Ioribaiwa before the Australians made their final stand on Imita Ridge in mid September. Having been successfully delayed, the Japanese supply lines were now over extended and in October the 25th Brigade took part in the hard-fought advance that finally pushed the Japanese out of the Owen Stanley Range. During this stage of the fighting, actions were fought again at Templeton&#x27;s Crossing and Oivi–Gorari before the Australians reached the Kumusi River on 13 November. During the fighting around the Kokoda Track, 359 men from the division were killed and another 560 were wounded.

The 21st Brigade returned for the Battle of Buna–Gona in late 1942, in which Australian and US forces suffered very high casualties, while capturing the main Japanese beachheads on the north coast of Papua. The 7th Division lost 750 men killed in this fighting and another 1,293 wounded. On 19 December 1942 QX5730 Sergeant Lionel Martindale Oxlade 2/7 Australian Division Cavalry Regiment was awarded an immediate Military Medal for having throughout the day and night shown qualities of courage and leadership which were an inspiration to his men. Between December 1942 and March 1943, the division was withdrawn back to Australia where, in early 1943, they were converted to the Jungle Divisional establishment, which saw a reduction in the division&#x27;s manpower by around 4,000 personnel.

During 1943–1944, the whole 7th Division fought extensive and often bloody operations against Japanese forces in the north east of New Guinea. After the airborne landings at Nadzab, west of Lae, divisional troops were flown to the Ramu Valley and Markham Valley between 7 and 12 September. Beginning at Nadzab, where Private Richard Kelliher earned a VC, they successfully advanced to Lae simultaneous with the 9th Division, which fell on 16 September.

Following the fall of Lae, in late September 1943 the 7th Division was ordered to establish itself around Dumpu and Marawasa to guard the approaches to Lae and begin patrolling operations into the Finisterre Ranges. Limited by a supply line that depended entirely upon air support, the division could only deploy two brigades, the 21st and 25th. After the 2/6th Commando Squadron captured Kaipit, starting on 5 October, the 21st and 25th Brigades began the advance up with the 21st Brigade moving along the Faria River, aiming towards the Kankiryo Saddle, while the 25th Brigade advanced through the Ramu valley. The Japanese positions on Kankiryo and around Shaggy Ridge threatened the security of the airfields that had been established around Dumpu and, as a result, the decision was made for the 7th Division to capture them.

Throughout October a number of battles were fought. On 8–10 October, the 2/27th captured the high ground around Beveridge&#x27;s Post, Trevor&#x27;s Ridge and Pallier&#x27;s Hill. On 11 October, a single platoon from the 2/14th Battalion destroyed a Japanese company at Pallier&#x27;s Hill before a counterattack by 500 Japanese troops on the 2/27th&#x27;s positions on John&#x27;s Knoll and Trevor&#x27;s Ridge was turned back on 12 October. In November, as the Australians approached the Japanese positions around Shaggy Ridge, the 25th Brigade took over from the 21st as the division&#x27;s main effort. For the following month the division confined itself to patrolling operations only. In early December, the 21st Brigade took over from the 25th, and throughout late December 1943 and into January 1944 heavy fighting took place with attacks on the two Prothero features, Shaggy Ridge, Green Sniper&#x27;s Pimple and the Kankiryo Saddle during the Battle of Shaggy Ridge. On 4 January 1944, the 18th Brigade relieved the 21st. By February, following an attack on Crater Hill, the main Japanese positions had been captured and shortly afterwards, elements of the 7th Division began to return to Australia. The 25th Brigade departed throughout January and February, and the 21st followed in February and March. The 18th Brigade remained in New Guinea until May, although they were replaced around Shaggy Ridge in February by the 15th Brigade, a Victorian Militia formation transferred from command under the 3rd Division and brought under the 7th Division in January.

As a show of gratitude to the assistance provided by locals, a memorial school was built at Situm by the Australian 7th Division AIF Association in 1964.

===Borneo===
In early 1944, the 7th Division returned to Australia in stages and, following a six-week period of leave, it toured the country conducting welcome home marches in a number of state capitals including Perth, Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne. In April, the division began to re-form in north Queensland, where it undertook a long period of training in preparation for future operations, including amphibious assault training and brigade-level and division-level manoeuvres. Future operations were perceived to involve a possible commitment to the fighting in the Philippines in late 1944, but this did not eventuate. Finally, in May 1945, the division received orders to deploy overseas again and by 19 June they arrived on Morotai Island, where they began to prepare for operations in Borneo, as part of Operation Oboe.

In July 1945, the whole division, supported by the 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion and the Militia&#x27;s 1st Armoured Regiment, was deployed in the Borneo campaign, and undertook the amphibious assault on Balikpapan, in Dutch Borneo. The initial landing took place on the southern coast on 1 July, with the 18th and 21st Brigades conducting the assault while the 25th Brigade remained at sea in reserve. Following its initial success on the first day, the 21st Brigade began the advance east, capturing an airfield at Seppinggang and crossing the Batakan Ketjil river where they came up against a strong Japanese force on 3 July. Meanwhile, the 18th Brigade secured the high ground around Klandasan before capturing the town of Balikpapan on 3 July. They were then subsequently relieved by the 25th Brigade. On 4 July, the 21st Brigade, having overcome the Japanese resistance that it had encountered the previous day, resumed their advance to the east. They were subsequently engaged by Japanese coastal defence artillery near the Manggar Besar river; they were unable to overcome this until 9 July. The 21st then captured Sambodja, from Manggar, before sending out patrols in support of the 25th Brigade.

The 25th Brigade advanced along the Milford Highway, moving to the north-east towards Samarinda. Coming up against a well-entrenched Japanese rear guard, the advance slowed as the position was reduced with artillery and air support, as the brigade began to encircle the position. Before this could be completed, however, the Japanese were able to withdraw from the position on the night of 21/22 July. This brought an end to the main combat operations, although the Australians continued patrol operations and minor clashes continued until the war ended in August. The campaign had cost the 7th Division 185 killed and 470 wounded.

Following the end of hostilities, the division remained in Borneo undertaking a variety of tasks including guarding Japanese prisoners and restoring law and order. As the demobilisation process began, members of the division were slowly repatriated to Australia or transferred to other units for further service. Some personnel were used to form the 65th Battalion, which was formed to undertake occupation duties in Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force.

The 7th Division was finally disbanded in 1946. This was done in stages, with the divisional headquarters disbanding in January–February, and the division&#x27;s component units disbanding between December 1945 and March 1946. A total of 2,063 men from the division were killed during the war, while a further 4,356 were wounded. Approximately 40,000 men served with the division between 1940 and 1946.

<text>In a drum kit, splash cymbals are the smallest accent cymbals, often a smaller derivative of the more common crash cymbals. Splash cymbals and china cymbals are the main types of effects cymbals.

The most common sized splash has a diameter of 10&quot;, followed by 8&quot;. Most splash cymbals are in the size range of 6&quot; to 13&quot;, but some splash cymbals are as small as 4&quot;.

Some makers have produced cymbals described as &quot;splash&quot; up to 22&quot;, but a splash of 14&quot; or more is more often described as a crash cymbal.

Splash cymbals include:
* Traditional splash cymbals, medium in weight with little or no taper.
* Rock splash cymbals, heavy but often with a slight taper.
* China splash cymbals.
* Salsa splash cymbals.
* Thin splash cymbals.
* Bell cymbals.
* Specialised &quot;stack&quot; cymbals.

==History==
The original and traditional &quot;splash&quot;, like many of the cymbal types in a drum kit, was invented and named by Gene Krupa in collaboration with the Avedis Zildjian Company.

Widely used in the jazz music of the 1920s and 30s, this traditional splash cymbal was not seen for many years in mainstream music for years until drummers such as Ringo Starr started to use them. Stewart Copeland playing in The Police brought it back to prominence. Thanks to a toy cymbal he found in a trip in Asia and which he brought to Paiste, heavier splash cymbals, more suited to this style of drumming, were soon available and started being heavily commercialized.

A third phase in the development of splash cymbals occurred when china splash cymbals became popular. These added a new dimension to drumming in their own right, and also led to the development of cymbal stacks.

Several other types that are now regarded as splash cymbals, such as bell and salsa cymbals, have more quietly been added to the kits of leading drummers and to the catalogues of major cymbal manufacturers over the years. Today much of the color of an extended drum kit is provided by the wide variety of splash cymbals available. 
==Types==
===Traditional===

Traditional splash cymbals, as first popularized by Gene Krupa, are 8&quot;-12&quot; in size and medium in weight with little or no taper and therefore a thick rim for their size.

The normal function of a splash cymbal is to provide a short, often highly syncopated accent. For their size, they are hit relatively hard to produce a quick attack and decay. They tend to have little taper in order to provide the necessary strength for this, the bell being approximately the same thickness as the rim, resulting in limited richness of tone.
===Rock===
Rock musicians favor a heavier splash cymbal often with a slight taper, 6&quot;-12&quot;, giving a fuller sound at higher volumes.

===China===

China type cymbals of less than 14&quot; are generally referred to as china splash cymbals when used in a drum kit, and are made in a wide variety of shapes and in sizes 6&quot;-12&quot;.

This terminology is not entirely consistent. Sabian for example call their rounded bell 12&quot; china a mini Chinese, and this same design is also available in 14&quot;, Paiste Twenty Series features a rounded bell mini china 8&quot;, 10&quot; and 12&quot;, while in the Saluda Voodoo series the 12&quot; square bell china is simply called a &quot;china&quot;, while the heavier 10&quot; rounded bell model is called a &quot;china splash&quot;. This is not entirely illogical; Many of these cymbals have little or no taper, and as a result some of the heavier ones, unlike most splash cymbals, can be used as an exotic ride cymbal at moderate volume.

The 8&quot; and 10&quot; Sabian Rocktagon splash cymbals, smaller versions of their octagonal 16&quot; and 18&quot; &quot;Rocktagon&quot; crashes, are sometimes described as china splashes and have an intermediate tone.

China splashes were used in Mike Portnoy&#x27;s original cymbal stacks, and remain popular as the top cymbal in a stack.

Examples:
* Hubei C series china 8&quot; 
* Sabian AAX Mini Chinese 12&quot; 
* Saluda Decadence China Blast 10&quot;
* Paiste Twenty Mini China 8&quot;

===Salsa===
A salsa splash is a small cymbal primarily intended for use with a set of timbales. Use of a cymbal or cowbell (but by tradition, never both) is a fundamental part of many styles of timbale playing.

Example:
* Sabian El Sabor Salsa Splash 13&quot; 

===Thin===
Thin splash cymbals are made in sizes 8&quot;-12&quot; with a pronounced taper and a sound more akin to a crash than to traditional splashes. They are fragile and unsuitable for inexperienced drummers, and even then suitable only for quieter playing, and generally only available in B20 alloy and in the more expensive and professional cymbal series.

At the thinnest and most fragile end of the scale, a thin splash is identical to, and interchangeable with, a cymbal designed for playing by hand rather than by stick. And in either case, a single careless stroke with a drumstick will split the cymbal.

===Bell===
Bell cymbals, 4&quot;-8&quot; or occasionally bigger, are extremely thick cymbals giving a bell-like tone. Paiste makes one in 13&quot;.

The earliest bell cymbals were made by cutting down a larger cymbal, particularly to salvage something from one that was badly split at the edge.

Bell cymbals range in shape from deep and cuplike, similar in shape to a church bell, to a traditional cymbal shape, almost flat, and many in between.
===Sizzle splash===

Small sizzle cymbals, and splash cymbals with sizzler attachments, give an even shorter, washier tone than a traditional splash.

===Stacks===
Specialised thin &quot;stack&quot; cymbals, 8&quot;-12&quot;, are designed specifically for stacking, most commonly as the upper cymbal.

They are available individually or, more recently, in sets of two or three, including larger cymbals intended primarily as the lower cymbal or cymbals. These sets have provided new sounds but have not replaced the established technique of using a china, crash or another splash as the upper cymbal of a stack. Generally, the three way sets are designed to make possible several usable two-cymbal stacks in addition to the three-cymbal combination, and most cymbals of all such sets are designed to also be stacked with other cymbals, giving a very wide range of tonal possibilities.

Similarly, despite the availability of these cymbals specifically designed for stacking, many drummers still use a china or a splash as the upper cymbal.

Examples:
* Sabian Max Stax High 8&quot; 
* Paiste Noise Works Tripple Raw Smash 12&quot;, 14&quot;, 14&quot; 

==Mounting==
The splash cymbal, because of its varied usage and small size, is mounted in many ways. Some common ways are:

* On a separate boom stand. This can be of relatively light construction without a counterweight owing to the light weight of the cymbal.
* On an auxiliary boom attached to a stand used principally to support a drum or another, larger cymbal. This is the traditional method.
* On an auxiliary boom attached to the rim of a snare drum or timbales. This is particularly popular for playing latin rhythms.
* By &quot;piggybacking&quot; on a larger cymbal. The two cymbals must be separated by an extra felt if they are not to each affect the other&#x27;s tone and risk damage.
* By use of a double stand that mounts the top cymbal on an extension of the stand that replaces the wing nut holding the bottom cymbal. These are commercially available but more often created by adding an accessory to a single stand.
* As the upper cymbal in a stack in which another cymbal is deliberately in contact with the splash.

Several of these techniques, notably &quot;stacking&quot; and &quot;piggybacking&quot;, are very rarely used for cymbals other than splash cymbals. The rim-mounted boom is restricted to splash cymbals owing to the weight of other cymbal types, but similar mounts, traditionally on the top of the rear rim of the bass drum but also on other drums, are occasionally used for other lightweight accent effects, particularly a cowbell and/or a wood block.

===Stacking===

A cymbal stack is a combination of two or more cymbals mounted in contact, producing a sound unlike any single cymbal. The effect is similar to a loosely closed hi-hat, or can alternatively be seen as an extreme case of a sizzle cymbal with the upper cymbal serving as a single large jangle. The exact effect is dependent on the tension on the mounting bolt, and with some combinations can be varied from a very short crunch to a much longer buzz.

This technique was pioneered by Dave Weckl, Mike Portnoy and others, originally using a china splash as the upper cymbal. Portnoy mounted both cymbals bell up, with no spacing felt, to maximize contact between them, and choosing cymbals of sufficiently different profile to ensure that the contact was not enough to choke them completely.

As the technique became established, cymbal makers introduced specialized &quot;stack cymbals&quot; designed specifically for use in stacks. However the older technique, using a china splash on top of a crash, china or another splash, also remains popular.

Stacking should not be confused with &quot;piggybacking&quot;, in which the upper cymbal is bell down, the lower cymbal bell up, and a spacing felt is used between the cymbal bells, preventing any contact.

===Piggybacking===
Piggybacking is a method of mounting a splash cymbal, mostly restricted to small splashes, by simply placing it inverted above another cymbal, with which it shares the mounting bolt and its sheath, washers if used and wingnut. A spacing felt is normally used to separate the cymbals, serving as the top felt of the lower cymbal and the bottom felt of the upper cymbal in order to avoid cymbal cracking.

There is an essential difference between this technique and &quot;stacking&quot;. A cymbal stack produces a different sound to that produced by either cymbal individually. The piggyback, like the double stand, is primarily a method of mounting the splash cymbal, without producing any major difference in the tone of either cymbal.

Advantages of piggyback mounting are:
* Requires minimal mounting space, and therefore produces a more compact drum kit.
** Allows the drummer to move between the two cymbals of the piggyback in a single motion.
** A bonus for drummers who play in venues where space is very limited.
** In very large, extended kits, it allows more cymbals to be within reach of the drummer.
* Requires little or no extra equipment, only the cymbal itself and normally one extra felt for spacing between the cymbals.
** Faster setup and takedown.
** Lighter traps cases.
** Less to buy.
* It is possible to connect the two cymbals tonally by leaving out the spacing felt (but this risks damage and probably voids any warranty on both cymbals).

Disadvantages are:
* Requires the upper cymbal to be mounted bell down.
** Produces a trashier tone which not all drummers like.
** Exposes the rim to the stick in a way that the designer did not intend, often leading to damage. Many splashes have a relatively thick rim for their size, and can withstand a stroke that would break a crash cymbal, but thin splashes cannot generally be mounted bell down.
* Restricts playing of the lower cymbal, generally even to making playing its bell impossible.
* Restricts adjustment of the damping of either cymbal. The mounting bolt tension and the size of one felt are the same for both cymbals, as the mounting bolt, wingnut and this felt are all shared between them.

Many china splash cymbals and some bell cymbals are designed to be mounted bell down, and are particularly suited to piggyback mounting. Other splash cymbals, however, are very rarely mounted bell down except when piggybacked.

Most but not all drummers put an additional felt between the bells of the two cymbals, to eliminate any direct contact between the cymbals and retain the tone of each. However the slight contact between the bells if the extra felt is not used affects the tone of each cymbal only subtly, and some drummers like the tonal connection that results. Beginners sometimes use this technique for another reason entirely: The mounting bolt may not be long enough to allow an extra felt, or they may simply not have bought a felt when buying their first splash. Unfortunately, the metal to metal contact and the playing of the upturned splash rim both decrease the life of the cymbal, particularly at the hands of a beginner.

The lower cymbal of the piggyback is often a crash, or less often a ride, but larger splashes and even chinas can be used. The upper cymbal could in theory be any cymbal small enough to allow the lower cymbal to be played, but in practice is almost always a splash.

<doc id="736129" wikidata="Q1690444" url="?curid=736129" title="Vinyl roof">
<text>Vinyl roof refers to a vinyl covering for an automobile&#x27;s top.

This covering was originally designed to give the appearance of a convertible to models with a fixed roof and eventually evolved into a styling statement in its own right. Vinyl roofs were most popular in the American market, and they are considered one of the period hallmarks of the 1970s domestic cars. Vinyl roofs were also popular on European- (especially UK-) and Japanese-built cars during the 1970s, and tended to be applied to sporting or luxury trim versions of standard saloon (sedan) models.

==History==
The vinyl roof cover was during the 1920s as a necessity to keep precipitation from occupants of the car. Other materials included leather and canvas. Some coverings replicated the appearance of a movable top, similar to those on horse carriages, along with landau bars. 

The use of vinyl to cover the roofs of regular automobiles was to &quot;give fixed-roof cars some of the flair and appeal of their convertible counterparts.&quot; An example is the 1928 - 1929 Ford Model &quot;A&quot; Special Coupe, featuring a roof completely covered with a vinyl-like material. This Model &quot;A&quot; Special Coupe&#x27;s vinyl roof had two exposed seams on the back corners, with a lateral seam on the top covered with a narrow trim strip. 

The technique fell out of favor in the 1930s as painted steel was considered a better roof. Smoother, pontoon bodies began to be fashionable with metal.

After World War II, the first example of using a fabric-covered top as a styling element, rather than a functional accessory, was the 1949 Kaiser Virginian. This four-door sedan model was a fixed-roof version of the Kaiser Manhattan four-door convertible and the roof was covered with the same nylon fabric as the convertible. 

The pillarless hardtop body style was introduced to resemble convertibles. Because Ford did not have a hardtop body style offered by General Motors and Chrysler, a vinyl-covered roof was optional on the 1950 two-door Ford Crestliner, Mercury Monterey, and Lincoln Lido models as an effort to simulate the look of a convertible. This was not popular and the vinyl-covered models were discontinued the following year as Ford introduced pillarless hardtop models for 1951.

Kaiser Motors introduced a unique trim option in 1951 for their all-new full-size four-door sedans. The interior vinyl upholstery featured simulated reptile pattern and an optional padded vinyl covered roof with a lizard skin pattern that was named &quot;Dinosaur.&quot; The automaker introduced a special luxury model, the Kaiser Dragon for the 1953 model year. In addition to numerous standard equipment and features such as 14-karat gold plated hood ornament and nameplates, the cars special upholstery and padded roof now featured a grass-patterned &quot;Bambu&quot; vinyl.

Lincoln simulated the appearance of a convertible on some Cosmopolitan coupes in the 1950s, as did the Kaiser on Manhattan sedans, although the material was still canvas as was used on the folding tops of convertibles of the time instead of vinyl.

For the 1959 model year, the Chrysler&#x27;s Imperial featured a Landau top and the 1959 Desoto Adventurer Sportsman hardtop had a full roof that was not covered with vinyl, but both models had a textured black paint that was designed to look like leather.

Probably the first modern vinyl roof as it would later be accepted was the 1956 Cadillac Eldorado Seville that came standard with a roof covered in an early vinyl material called &quot;Vicodec&quot; which was simply diamond point convertible fabric. The recommended cleaning methods were the same for the Eldorado as regular convertible tops. The fabric was applied over a thin pad with two parallel seams running the length of the roof to mimic the appearance of a convertible model. Sales were low, but the Eldorado Seville with its vinyl roof was produced until 1960.

Ford followed a few years later with a vinyl roof option on the 1962 Ford Thunderbird that also re-introduced landau bars as a styling element. The vinyl covering proved popular, and some form of vinyl trim would be seen on Thunderbird roofs for the next two decades.

Other manufacturers followed. Vinyl appeared on some coupe models in GM&#x27;s 1962 full-size line. Chrysler made a vinyl roof available on the Dodge Dart. Ford offered it on the Mustang. By mid-decade, four-door sedans, as well as coupes and station wagons offered by all automakers could be topped with several colorful types of vinyl.

Vinyl-covered roofs became very common in most car classes by the late-1960s. Vinyl was produced that mimicked other materials such as canvas, and even alligator or snake hide. Chrysler briefly produced some patterns, with paisley or floral designs – this was called the &quot;Mod Top&quot; option. The Mercury Cougar briefly offered a houndstooth pattern. There was even an aftermarket spray-on product that claimed to add that factory vinyl look. By 1972, even the Ford Pinto offered a vinyl roof option.

At about that same time, the modern opera window first appeared, and it went so well with a vinyl surround that the two together became emblematic of American body design in the 1970s. During this period, vinyl with padding under it was sometimes used, allowing the top to somewhat mimic the feel as well as the look of a genuine convertible. 

European and Japanese manufacturers offered vinyl-covered roofs. Chrysler&#x27;s European-built cars used it on upmarket models of its Hunter and Avenger saloons. Ford had vinyl roofs on its European Escorts, Cortinas, Taunuses, and Granadas into the early 1980s. British Leyland had vinyl roofs on the last Wolseley and top-end Princess models and the feature was optional for all other models. Volvo featured a standard vinyl top on its most luxurious two-door 262 C coupe. Toyota adopted vinyl roofs for its Corona Mark II, Crown and Century sedans in the mid-1970s, and they could be found on Nissan Laurels, Cedrics, and Glorias.

Vinyl-covered roofs continued to appear in many car lines through the 1980s, but the coming of the &quot;aero look,&quot; first introduced to the U.S. market by the 1983 Thunderbird, tended to militate against both opera windows and vinyl roofs, as their more formal style did not go well with the sleek profile designers were beginning to emphasize. Canvas-look tops, often called cabriolet roofs, with simulated convertible top bows under the fabric, gained some popularity. The availability of all vinyl styles dwindled in the 1990s, until the 2002 Lincoln Continental offered one of the last factory-applied versions.

Hearse and limousine bodies almost universally still have vinyl tops. Not only are they part of the expected style of those vehicles, but they have a practical advantage in covering up the welded body seams that result when standard sedans are stretched to greater length. 

Aftermarket customizers also continue to install vinyl roofs of various types. These are usually seen on Cadillacs and Lincolns, but can be fitted to virtually any car.

==Styles==

Several vinyl roof designs evolved during the 1960s and 1970s:

*Full - this is the most commonly seen style, in which the vinyl simply covers the whole top of the car, including the C pillars. The windshield pillars may or may not be covered. If &quot;a B&quot; sedan pillar exists, it is usually not covered, but there are many exceptions.
*Canopy - in this style, the vinyl covering is applied only to the front half or two-thirds of the roof, usually ending at the trailing edge of the rear side windows. The windshield pillars are very commonly covered in this style, but the C pillars never are.
*Halo - this type is similar to the above, but the vinyl stops just short of the tops of the side windows and windshield, allowing a &quot;halo&quot; of painted sheet metal to appear between the vinyl and the glass area.
*Landau - this is almost the opposite of the canopy, as the vinyl covers the rear quarter or third of the roof, including the C pillars, coming as far forward as the trailing edge of either the rear or front side window. In common parlance, this was often called the &quot;half roof,&quot; although logically that term could apply to the canopy as well.
*Landau and canopy - Both styles on one vehicle. On vinyl-equipped 1977-79 Thunderbirds, two separate vinyl areas existed, one starting at the base of the windshield pillars and extending back to the trailing edge of the front side windows, and another starting at the base of the rear window and coming forward as far as the leading edge of the rear side window. These were separated by a targa band of sheet metal in the middle of the roof, which swept down at the sides to form a thick sedan-like pillar on the sides. It was an updated appearance from the 1955 Ford Crown Victoria &quot;basket handle&quot;.

The opera window was mounted in this pillar and was surrounded by sheet metal, not adjacent to either vinyl area. Three windows were mounted on each side of these cars; the Fairmont Futura had a similar style, differing only in not using the center opera window. 

A comparable two-piece roof covering was available on the AMC Pacer that emphasized the bump in the roof that accommodated the roll bar over the passenger compartment.

*Up and over - Chrysler&#x27;s large and intermediate coupes in the mid to late 1970s were available with a unique design. These cars all had opera windows, and the vinyl extended to only a couple of inches behind the opera window rather than all the way to the rear window as in the case with a full vinyl top treatment. The line of the vinyl then turned upward to run over the top of the car, leaving a margin of sheet metal almost like a roll bar sticking up at the very back of the roof.

<text>released as Dark Cloud 2 in North America, is a 2002 action role-playing game developed by Level-5 and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2 (PS2). It was released in Japan before releasing in English in 2003. An emulated version of the game was released for the PlayStation 4 through the PlayStation Network in 2016.

The game is a successor to 2000&#x27;s &quot;Dark Cloud&quot;, with which it shares the same basic game mechanics but features new characters and plot. Players control two main protagonists, Max and Monica, who must work together to stop the game&#x27;s main antagonist, Emperor Griffon, from destroying the world. The game features themes of time traveling, with Max and Monica trying to prevent Griffon&#x27;s destruction by altering the past to change the future.

The game was met with positive reviews from critics, who praised the improvements over &quot;Dark Cloud&quot;, in particular the graphics and variety of gameplay styles. &quot;Dark Chronicle&quot; won several awards, and sold roughly 250,000 copies in Japan within a month.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Dark Chronicle&quot; is an action role-playing game played from a third-person perspective. The player moves through procedurally-generated dungeons, battles monsters and collects items. Throughout most of the game, players control characters Max and Monica. Max fights with a wrench as his melee weapon and a gun as his ranged weapon. Monica uses a sword and a magical bracelet. Combat in the game uses real time hack and slash techniques. Each character also has a unique combat ability: Max can pilot a customizable, mech-like vehicle called the Ridepod, and Monica can shapeshift into monsters.

Unlike most action role-playing games in which the characters level-up, weapons in &quot;Dark Chronicle&quot; instead do the leveling. Once a certain number of experience points (called &quot;absorption points&quot;) have been gained, the weapon is automatically leveled up. As weapons level up, their number of &quot;Synthesis Points&quot; increases, determining how many &quot;spectrumized&quot; items can be attached to it. Most items in this game can be broken down, or &quot;spectrumized&quot;, which turns the item into a &quot;SynthSphere&quot; that can be attached to a weapon to raise specific stats, depending on its properties. Attachments cost synthesis points; when the weapon&#x27;s points are depleted, no more attachments can be made until the weapon is leveled up and more synthesis points are attained. Weapons can also be spectrumized but the resulting SynthSphere will be unstable unless the weapon is level five or higher.

Weapons can be evolved into a more powerful form if certain requirements are met; some also require the player to have defeated particular types of enemies.

As in &quot;Dark Cloud&quot;, weapons wear out over time and must be repaired to avoid breakage. In contrast with &quot;Dark Cloud&quot;, broken weapons do not disappear from the players&#x27; inventories but become unusable until repaired and lose some of the experience they have accrued. As in the previous game, characters can only grow stronger by consuming particular items that permanently increase their health points and defense.

A major component of &quot;Dark Chronicle&quot;″s gameplay involves special items called &quot;Geostones&quot; which are used to rebuild the world outside the dungeons. When removed from the dungeon, Geostones can be placed into the database of a machine called the &quot;Carpenterion&quot;, which turns them into plans for building objects, including houses, trees, lights and rivers, which the player may build once the plans are available and the player has the necessary materials. At this point, the player can enter &quot;Georama mode&quot;—a gameplay mode similar to city-building games—and arrange the pieces on the landscape. Buildings can then be populated with villagers recruited from other levels throughout the game. Certain conditions must be met for each village; when each condition is completed, something significant in the future changes. Each Georama map must complete as many of the conditions for that map as possible; it is not necessary to achieve 100% to advance the plot in any map, but doing so earns the player bonus items.

The player can recruit non-player characters (NPCs) onto their teams at various points in the game by performing specific tasks. These characters are never controllable and do not appear in battle, but players can access a party member&#x27;s special ability through the &quot;Characters&quot; portion of the menu. Each character has a different ability and only one can be active at a time. Some characters can influence a battle, such as increasing item drops and adjusting enemy behavior; others can produce certain items inside or outside dungeons.

Fishing is another feature of the game; players can catch fish to breed and train in their fish tanks. Later in the game, players&#x27; fish can be entered into weigh-in competitions and races. The game also has an invention system with which players take photographs of various items and combine them to generate ideas for inventions, which can be created if players have the required materials. A golf minigame called &quot;spheda&quot; is playable on every completed floor.

==Plot==
A princess runs to her father&#x27;s room in a castle in a panic. She arrives to find a man standing over her dead father&#x27;s body. The man disappears in a ball of light.

Elsewhere, a boy named Max from the town of Palm Brinks attends a circus. By coincidence, he overhears a conversation where ringmaster Flotsam pressures the town mayor Need to find a special stone located in the town. Max makes a loud noise and unintentionally gets Flotsam&#x27;s attention - who notices Max is wearing the special stone as a pendant. Max escapes, and embarks on an adventure by leaving the town via the sewers.

After leaving the town, Max is told that 15 years ago Emperor Griffon destroyed the world but spared Palm Brinks because he wanted a special stone - Max&#x27;s pendant - and that Flotsam is one of Griffon&#x27;s henchman. Flotsam again finds Max but is interrupted and defeated by the princess, who we learn is called Monica. Monica lives in the time 100 years after Max&#x27;s present. Like Max, she has a special stone. Their two stones - called atlamillia - allow them to travel between Max&#x27;s time and Monica&#x27;s time.

Max and Monica use their new ability to time travel, as well as the reopening of the railroad by Mayor Need to go on a mission rebuilding areas of the world that Griffon destroyed. In doing so, they fix the future - Monica&#x27;s time - allowing them to get the help from the future they need to beat Griffon.

During these adventures, they learn that Emperor Griffon possesses a gold atlamillia - the most powerful of the three - but desires the other two to make him all powerful. Upon the completion of Paznos, a flying fortress capable of transforming into a mech, Max and Monica use it to help defeat Griffon&#x27;s army in Monica&#x27;s time. During the battle, Max and Monica receive word that Ixion, a time-traveling train, has also been completed at Luna Lab.

Max and Monica use Ixion to head 10,000 years into the past to face Emperor Griffon, a young moon-person who lives in Moon Flower Palace. He tricks them into thinking they had defeated him, stealing their atlamillia and revealing his real form. Griffon plans to summon the Star of Oblivion, which will destroy all life on Earth and allow a new, better world to grow in its place. He starts by moving his palace into the sky of Max&#x27;s time to destroy the world.

Max and Monica return to Max&#x27;s time with Ixion, and travel to Kazarov Stonehenge - a place that can act as a time portal - allowing them to bring Paznos to Max&#x27;s time. They activate it, and Paznos arrives in Max&#x27;s time and sends the Moon Flower Palace crashing to the ground.

Once again, Max and Monica face Griffon at the Palace. They instead meet a woman named Alexandra, who tells them she owns the Palace and that Griffon was once an orphan child called Sirus, whom Alexandra adopted. Sirus has forgotten his childhood because of the evil inside him. Alexandra asks them to restore the palace&#x27;s garden to remind Sirus of his old life.

They do so and confront Griffon. These old memories weaken Griffon and Max and Monica manage to defeat him - turning him back into Sirus, who is mortally wounded. A Dark Element rises from Sirus&#x27; body and calls the Star of Oblivion. The Element reveals it was born from Sirus&#x27; hatred of humans and plans to rule over the destroyed Earth. Max, Monica and Sirus defeat the Element. Sirus stops the Star of Oblivion, dying in the process.

==Development==
Rumors about &quot;Dark Chronicle&quot; first appeared in April 2002, when Level-5 Inc. updated its website with an image of a silhouette from its newest game, although no other details were made available at the time. The game was officially announced on May 16, when Level-5 launched a full website that revealed the new game would include &quot;Dark Cloud&quot; Georama mode and had more features than its predecessor. The site also demonstrated the cel-shaded graphics and featured pictures of the two protagonists.

More information was revealed at E3 later in May, when Sony Computer Entertainment announced the game would be released in Japan and Europe as &quot;Dark Chronicle&quot; and in North America as &quot;Dark Cloud 2&quot;, with a release date of late 2002 to early 2003. The invention system, which according to Sony would feature over 100 hours of gameplay, was also demonstrated for the first time. IGN and GameSpot both featured previews of the game based on the E3 demo; IGN focused on the improved Georama system and praised the cel-shaded graphics, and GameSpot looked at the dungeons, finding the combat improved from the first game.

The visual style of &quot;Dark Chronicle&quot; departs from that of &quot;Dark Cloud&quot; by using cel shading. Level-5 referred to the graphic style as &quot;tonal rendering&quot;; the main characters have a smooth, shaded look and the backgrounds have detailed textures and lighting. The main characters have a higher polygon count than the supporting characters and are composed of 2,500 to 3,000 polygons. Supporting characters are composed of 1,500 to 2,000 polygons. The game&#x27;s graphics were created with Softimage 3D. Cutscenes use the models that are used in normal gameplay, both of which are generated in real-time, thus costume changes are carried over from gameplay to cutscenes. Akihiro Hino, the game&#x27;s writer, director, designer and producer, said that &quot;smooth transitions between gameplay and event scenes help increase the empathy for the game&quot;. Soft textures were used to create a uniform feel for the visuals and to minimize the computer-generated appearance of the cel shading. Texture mapping was used occasionally to emulate lighting. The game&#x27;s production took almost two years; the CG production and game development occurred simultaneously.

An emulated version of the game for the PlayStation 4 through the PlayStation Network was released in January 2016. It features 1080p resolution, trophy support, Remote Play, and Share Play compatibility.

===Music===
The game&#x27;s music was composed and produced by Tomohito Nishiura. A two-disc album, &quot;Dark Chronicle Original Sound Tracks&quot;, was released in Japan by Scitron on February 19, 2003. GameSpot&#x27;s Brad Shoemaker wrote that &quot;&quot;Dark Cloud 2&quot; music ranges from good to excellent&quot;, and said that &quot;generally there are enough tunes that you won&#x27;t get too bored of hearing any particular one&quot;. IGN&#x27;s Kaiser Hwang wrote that &quot;the music in &quot;Dark Cloud 2&quot; ranges from really good, to really really good, to exceptionally good&quot;. A remix album, &quot;Dark Chronicle Premium Arrange&quot;, was published in Japan by Team Entertainment in April 21, 2004. It consists of 12 arranged tracks from the game by Yasunori Mitsuda, Shinji Hosoe, Motoi Sakuraba, Yoko Shimomura, Noriyuki Iwadare, Kenji Ito and The Black Mages.

===Sequel===
A sequel, potentially titled &quot;Dark Cloud 3&quot;, was first rumored to be in development for PlayStation 3 in an alleged leak published in 2006 by , which said Level-5 was aiming for a March 2009 release. In 2009, Level-5 manager Yoshiaki Kusuda said that although the company did not have a &quot;specific plan for a sequel&quot;, it would &quot;seriously consider making it&quot; if fans asked for it often enough, leading &quot;Kotaku&quot; writer Stephen Totilo to encourage readers to request the game. Totilo reported in 2010 and again in 2012 that several people had misread the original 2009 interview, were emailing him and asking him to make it. Reporting on a 2017 interview that Hino gave to &quot;Nikkei Business Publications&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; lamented that a &quot;Dark Cloud 3&quot; was not among Level-5&#x27;s plans for the Nintendo Switch. Hino told &quot;Polygon&quot; that Level-5 could not produce a new &quot;Dark Cloud&quot; game on its own because the license was co-owned by Sony.

==Reception==
&quot;Dark Chronicle&quot; received generally favorable reviews, with an aggregate score of 87 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on forty-one reviews. GameSpot&#x27;s Brad Shoemaker scored the game 9 out of 10, calling it &quot;one of the finest games released for the PlayStation 2 so far&quot; and &quot;an aesthetic masterpiece&quot;. He praised the variety of the gameplay, writing that &quot;there&#x27;s so much to do that it&#x27;s almost overwhelming&quot; and concluded that &quot;&quot;Dark Cloud 2&quot; is simply a class act all the way. Every element of the game, from the georama system to the weapon upgrading to the interaction with a large cast of characters, displays a polish and attention to quality that you find only in real classics&quot;. The publication named &quot;Dark Chronicle&quot; the best PlayStation 2 game of February 2003.

IGN&#x27;s Kaiser Hwang also scored the game 9 out of 10, calling it &quot;arguably the best looking PS2 game out there&quot;. He concluded that &quot;&quot;Dark Cloud 2&quot; takes the standard sequel road and gives us everything that made the original &quot;Dark Cloud&quot; great, only bigger and better... The leap in quality between the two games really is amazing. From the incredible graphics, to the great sound, to the refined gameplay, &quot;Dark Cloud 2&quot; just oozes of quality and polish&quot;. Eurogamer&#x27;s Ronan Jennings also scored the game 9 out of 10, writing &quot;it deserves credit for making us focus on actually &quot;doing&quot; things. Its qualities aren&#x27;t designed to bring quick gasps from casual gamers—they are designed to keep people like you playing for hours on end. Add great graphics, decent music and quality voice acting to the mix and there&#x27;s not much to say against it&quot;. GameSpy&#x27;s Christian Nutt scored the game 4 out of 5, saying it fell just short of being a classic: &quot;The biggest and most obvious problem with the game has to be its story. There was not a single, solitary moment during the game where I was even the slightest bit interested in or entertained by its copious, well-voiced, cinematic sequences. His conclusion was: There&#x27;s no question in my mind that &quot;Dark Cloud 2&quot; is one of the most solid RPG adventures for the PS2; but... it doesn&#x27;t quite live up to its potential. If Level-5 had worked out all of the kinks, it&#x27;d be one of my favorite games for the PS2. Sadly, it&#x27;s not. While it has my grudging respect, there are many games that I prefer, thanks to DC2&#x27;s idiosyncrasies&quot;.

Game Revolution&#x27;s Johnny Liu awarded the game a B, praising the graphics and variety of gameplay but said it became somewhat repetitive towards the end: &quot;&quot;Dark Cloud 2&quot; is very serial in nature. It&#x27;s a game you can pick up and play for a few hours, stomping though a few dungeon floors, trying to solve a problem or two, but after a while it meanders towards repetition. In truth, the game is filled with innumerable challenges, likable characters and a high production value. But beneath the surface, the lightweight story and characters combined with the almost rigidly episodic game flow still hold it back&quot;.

===Sales and awards===
&quot;Dark Chronicle&quot; sold 235,917 copies in Japan by the end of 2002.

The game won &quot;Best PlayStation 2 Game&quot; (2003) from GameSpot, and nominated for &quot;Console Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot; (2004) from the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences. It was also nominated for &quot;Best Adventure Game&quot; at the 1st British Academy Games Awards, losing to &quot;The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker&quot;. It received a &quot;Silver Award&quot; from &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; and a &quot;Bronze Award&quot; from &quot;&quot;. &quot;Dark Chronicle&quot; was named &quot;Game of the Month&quot; for February 2003 and given an &quot;Editor&#x27;s Choice&quot; award by IGN, which in 2010 placed it at #31 in their &quot;Top 100 PlayStation 2 Games&quot;.

<doc id="736139" wikidata="Q705373" url="?curid=736139" title="Third Taiwan Strait Crisis">
<text>The Third Taiwan Strait Crisis, also called the 1995–1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, or the 1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, was the effect of a series of missile tests conducted by the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) in the waters surrounding Taiwan, including the Taiwan Strait, from 21 July 1995 to 23 March 1996. The first set of missiles fired in mid-to-late 1995 was allegedly intended to send a strong signal to the Republic of China government under President Lee Teng-hui, who had been seen as &quot;moving its foreign policy away from the One-China policy&quot;, as claimed by PRC. The second set of missiles was fired in early 1996, allegedly intending to intimidate the Taiwanese electorate in the run-up to the 1996 presidential election.

==Lee&#x27;s 1995 visit to Cornell==

The crisis began when President Lee Teng-hui accepted an invitation from his alma mater, Cornell University, to deliver a speech on &quot;Taiwan&#x27;s Democratization Experience&quot;. Seeking to diplomatically isolate the Republic of China, the PRC opposed such visits by ROC (Taiwanese) leaders. A year earlier, in 1994, when President Lee&#x27;s plane had stopped in Honolulu to refuel after a trip to South America, the U.S. government under President Bill Clinton refused Lee&#x27;s request for a visa. Lee had been confined to the military airfield where he landed, forcing him to spend a night on his plane. A U.S. State Department official called the situation &quot;embarrassing&quot; and Lee complained that he was being treated as a second-class leader.

After Lee had decided to visit Cornell, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher assured PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen that a visa for Lee would be &quot;inconsistent with [the U.S.&#x27;s] unofficial relationship [with Taiwan].&quot; However, the humiliation from Lee&#x27;s last visit caught the attention of many pro-Taiwan figures in the U.S. and this time, the United States Congress acted on Lee&#x27;s behalf. The lobbying firm Cassidy &amp; Associates worked to obtain Congressional support for the visit. In May 1995, a concurrent resolution asking the State Department to allow Lee to visit the U.S. passed the House on 2 May with a vote of 396 to 0 (with 38 not voting), and the Senate on 9 May with a vote of 97 to 1 (with 2 not voting). The State Department relented on 22 May 1995. Lee spent 9–10 June 1995 in the U.S. at a Cornell alumni reunion.

The United States had not prepared the People&#x27;s Republic of China for its policy reversal in granting a visa. While in the United States, Lee stated, &quot;Taiwan is a country with independent sovereignty. PRC leadership described Lee&#x27;s moves as an effort to &quot;split the motherland&quot;. 

==1995==
On 7 July 1995, the PRC responded: the Xinhua News Agency announced missile tests would be conducted by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) and argued that this attitude would endanger the peace and safety of the region. At the same time, the PRC mobilized forces in Fujian. In the later part of July and early August, numerous commentaries were published by Xinhua and the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; condemning Lee and his cross-strait policies.

From 21 July to 28 July, the Second Artillery Corps (SAC) conducted a round of missile launches in an area 36 miles north of Taiwan. On 21 July, it launched two Dongfeng-15 missiles approximately 70 nautical miles from the coast of Taiwan. On 22 July, SAC fired two missiles at an area 40 miles north of Taiwan. On 24 July, it fired two more at the same area. Simultaneously, the PRC concentrated naval and amphibious landing forces in the area of the strait and conducted military exercises. 

The United States responded by sending two aircraft carrier groups to the vicinity of Taiwan. In July 1995, USS &quot;Belleau Wood&quot; (LHA-3) transited the Taiwan Strait.

From 15 August to 25 August, the East Sea Fleet deployed 59 naval vessels for exercises, during which the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force practiced 192 sorties.

The United States sent the USS O&#x27;Brien (DD-975) and USS McClusky FFG-41 through the strait on 11–12 December 1995. Finally on 19 December 1995, the USS &quot;Nimitz&quot; (CVN-68) and her battle group passed through the straits.

== 1996 ==
Between January and February 1996, the PRC concentrated 100,000 troops along the strait and conducted large scale exercises. Tensions remained high in early 1996 as Taiwan prepared for its first presidential election and Lee Teng-hui ran on the Kuomintang&#x27;s ticket.

On 8 March, the PRC fired more missiles 20 miles off Keelung and 29 miles off Kaohsiung. Over 70 percent of commercial shipping passed through the targeted ports, which were disrupted by the proximity of the tests.

The same day, United States President Clinton announced that the USS &quot;Independence&quot; CV-62 and her Carrier Battlegroup (Carrier Group Five), returning to Japan from its visit to the Philippines, would deploy to international waters near Taiwan. According to the Washington Post, that same day; the USS &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; CG-52 (which had detached from the &quot;Independence&quot; Battlegroup) along with a RC-135 Intelligence aircraft monitored the launch of 3 CSS-6 (DF-15) missiles from the PRC, two of them into shipping lanes near Kaohsiung and one fired directly over Taipei into a shipping lane near Keelung.

On the following day, the PRC announced live-fire exercises to be conducted near Penghu from 12 to 20 March. On 11 March, the U.S. dispatched USS &quot;Nimitz&quot; CVN-68 and her battlegroup, Carrier Group Seven. &quot;Nimitz&quot; and her battle group, along with &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;, sailed through the Taiwan Strait, while &quot;Independence&quot; did not. In response to the U.S. moves, the PRC announced further exercises.

From 18 March to 25 March, the PRC conducted military exercises involving airplanes, guided missile destroyers, submarines, and 150,000 troops at Pingtan Island. The exercises practiced amphibious landing, mountainous assaults, and included paratrooper exercises.

== Aftermath ==
Shipping and insurance rates for freight to Taiwan radically increased during the crisis and two of the Chinese missile launches twice closed the straits to all sea and airborne commerce.

The crisis boosted Lee by 5% in the polls, earning him a majority as opposed to a plurality. On March 23, 1996, Lee was elected Taiwan&#x27;s president.

Jiang ordered the PLA to begin a ten-year modernization program. Soon the People&#x27;s Republic ordered s from Russia, a Cold War-era class designed to counter U.S. Navy carrier battle groups, allegedly in mid-December 1996 during the visit to Moscow by Chinese Premier Li Peng. The PRC subsequently ordered modern attack submarines () and warplanes (76 Su-30MKK and 24 Su-30MK2) to counter the U.S. Navy&#x27;s carrier groups.

The military tests and exercises also strengthened the argument for further U.S. arms sales to the ROC and led to the strengthening of military ties between the U.S. and Japan, increasing the role Japan would play in defending Taiwan.

During the military exercises in March, there were preoccupations in Taiwan that the PRC would occupy some small islands controlled by Taiwan, causing panic among many citizens. Therefore, many flights from Taiwan to the United States and Canada were full. The most likely target was Wuqiu (Wuchiu), then garrisoned by 500 soldiers. The outlying islands were placed on high alert. The then secretary general of the National Security Council of Taiwan, Ting Mao-shih, flew to New York to meet Samuel Berger, Deputy National Security Advisor of the United States.

In 1999, Major General Liu Liankun, a top Chinese military logistics officer, and his subordinate Senior Colonel Shao Zhengzhong were arrested, court-martialed and executed for disclosing to Taiwan that the missiles had unarmed warheads despite the Chinese government&#x27;s claims.

==Unofficial forewarning==
According to Sankei Shimbun series &quot;Secret Records on Lee Teng-hui&quot; dated 1 April 2019, Tseng Yong-hsien, Lee&#x27;s National Policy Adviser, received a direct message from China official in early July 1995; &quot;Our ballistic missiles will be launched toward Taiwan a couple of weeks later, but you guys don&#x27;t have to worry.&quot; This was communicated to Lee soon after, to prevent escalation. Tseng, as an envoy of Lee, had met President Yang Shangkun in 1992 and had a secret connection with Ye Xuanning, Head of the Liaison Department of the PLA.

<text>The Fender Starcaster is a series of semi-hollowbody electric guitars made by the Fender company. The Starcaster was part of Fender&#x27;s attempt to enter the semi-hollowbody market, which was dominated by Gibson&#x27;s ES-335 and similar designs.

==History==
The Starcaster was designed by Gene Fields to be a high quality instrument, although it was manufactured at a time when Fender&#x27;s standards had lowered considerably. Unlike most semi-hollow guitars which had their necks set in the bodies in the traditional style, the Starcaster retained Fender&#x27;s bolt-on neck design, which at the time, used a three-bolt joint.

The Starcaster was in production from 1976 to 1982. However, an advertisement from 1977 states that the Starcaster&#x27;s first creation was in 1975.

===Re-use of Starcaster name===
The Starcaster name was revived for a range of &quot;value-priced&quot; &quot;Starcaster by Fender&quot; guitars, basses, and drums unrelated to the Starcaster of the 1970s. The guitars were usually the same shape as Fender&#x27;s Stratocaster and the bass the same shape as the Fender Jazz Bass. This line was discontinued by 2014.

===Reissues===
In September 2013 Fender reissued the Starcaster in continuation of its 2011 &quot;Modern Player&quot; series. The new version, offered in black, natural or aged cherryburst, closely resembles the original guitar but lacks some key features including the master volume control, string-through-body bridge, string tree for four strings, bullet truss rod adjuster and three-bolt neck attachment. Unlike the original from the 1970s, the new guitar features a tune-o-matic bridge with a stop tailpiece and bound f-holes.

Fender has also released a bass version of the Starcaster, an instrument that was never released, although at least three prototypes were created in the mid 1970s. The name &quot;Starcaster Bass&quot; is purely speculative as the existing prototypes have only the name Fender on the headstock, a feature which the new version retains.

Currently, Fender offers Classic Vibe, Affinity &amp; Contemporary versions of the model under their Squier brand. Fender has also released a Tom DeLonge signature model in 2024 featuring a single Seymour Duncan humbucker.

==Construction==
The Starcaster has a unique headstock design, with a black bottom curve. No other production Fender guitar before or since had the same headstock, but some prototypes of the Fender Marauder, also designed by Fields, had a similar headstock design. It is also unusual for a semi-hollow guitar in having an asymmetrical (&quot;offset&quot;) body, a maple fretboard, a bolt-on neck, a novel control configuration consisting of a volume and tone control for each pickup as well as a master volume control, and Fender&#x27;s traditional six-on-a-side tuning pegs.

==Popularity and usage==
The Starcaster was commercially unsuccessful, perhaps because of a public notion that Fender was a &quot;solid-body, single coil brand&quot; and Gibson was the &quot;semi-hollow, humbucker brand&quot;. As a result, Starcasters are very rare, but are worth less in today&#x27;s vintage market than many other semi-hollow guitars from the same period to collectors because of their unpopularity and lack of name endorsers at their time of manufacture.

The most prominent player to use the original 1970s Starcaster was Leo Nocentelli of The Meters.

Claydes Charles Smith of Kool and the Gang can be seen using one in the video for &quot;Celebration&quot;.
Jonny Greenwood, guitarist of Radiohead, can frequently be seen playing a Starcaster on stage. Sammy James, Jr., guitarist and front man of the Mooney Suzuki, uses a natural finished one and appeared on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; with it on June 21, 2007. The guitar can also be seen in the music video to Morrissey&#x27;s single &quot;You Have Killed Me&quot;. Dave Keuning of The Killers also started using one shortly before the release of the album Sam&#x27;s Town. He could be seen playing his Starcaster during The Killers&#x27; headline slot at Glastonbury Festival 2007, on &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot; for &quot;Read My Mind&quot; and in the videos for &quot;For Reasons Unknown&quot; and &quot;Human&quot;. Scott McMicken of Dr. Dog employs the Starcaster as one of his main guitars, along with an Epiphone Sheraton II and a Gibson ES-335.
Trey Anastasio of Phish plays a custom Languedoc guitar based on the Starcaster. Arctic Monkeys guitarist Jamie Cook can be seen playing one at the 2009 Reading Festival and in the video for the 2009 single &quot;Crying Lightning&quot;. Chris Walla of Death Cab For Cutie has occasionally used a Starcaster live. As mentioned on the &quot;Roderick on the Line&quot; podcast, John Roderick of The Long Winters owned and played a Starcaster. Mark Hempe of the New Orleans–based funk quintet Earphunk played a starcaster at the 2016 Major Rager in Augusta, Ga. British rock band Royal Blood&#x27;s Mike Kerr is often seen using either a black or custom-made white Starcaster Bass in various music videos and tours.
In 2022, Blink-182 and Angels &amp; Airwaves guitarist/vocalist Tom DeLonge began using Starcasters upon his return to Blink-182, switching from Gibson. Like previous signature models, this guitar consists of a single humbucker in the bridge position (namely a Seymour Duncan SH-5 Custom pickup) and one volume knob. Fender announced Artist Series versions of DeLonge&#x27;s custom Starcasters in April 2024.

<text>Lemna is a genus of free-floating aquatic plants referred to by the common name &quot;duckweed&quot;. They are morphologically divergent members of the arum family Araceae. These rapidly growing plants have found uses as a model system for studies in community ecology, basic plant biology, ecotoxicology, and production of biopharmaceuticals, and as a source of animal feeds for agriculture and aquaculture. Currently, 14 species of &quot;Lemna&quot; are recognised.

==Taxonomy==
These duckweeds were previously placed in a separate flowering plant family, the Lemnaceae, but they 
are now considered to be members of the Araceae.

==Description==
&quot;Lemna&quot; species grow as simple free-floating thalli on or just beneath the water surface. Most are small, not exceeding 5 mm in length, except &quot;Lemna trisulca&quot;, which is elongated and has a branched structure. &quot;Lemna&quot; thalli have a single root, which distinguishes this genus from the related genera &quot;Wolffia&quot; (lacks roots), &quot;Spirodela&quot; and &quot;Landoltia&quot; (have multiple roots).

The plants grow mainly by vegetative reproduction: two daughter plants bud off from the adult plant. This form of growth allows very rapid colonisation of new water. Duckweeds are flowering plants, and nearly all of them are known to reproduce sexually, flowering and producing seed under appropriate conditions. Certain duckweeds (such as &quot;L. gibba&quot;) are long-day plants, while others (such as &quot;L. minor&quot;) are short-day plants.

When &quot;Lemna&quot; invades a waterway, it can be removed mechanically, by the addition of herbivorous fish (e.g. grass carp), or, inadvisedly, treated with a herbicide.

The rapid growth of duckweeds finds application in bioremediation of polluted waters, in municipal wastewater treatment and as test organisms for environmental studies. It is also being used as an expression system for economical production of complex biopharmaceuticals.

Duckweed meal (dried duckweed) is a good cattle feed. It contains 25–45% protein (depending on the growth conditions), 4.4% fat, and 8–10% fibre, measured by dry weight.

==As a bioassay==
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) guidelines describe toxicity testing using &quot;L. gibba&quot; or &quot;L. minor&quot; as test organisms. Both of these species have been studied extensively for use in phytotoxicity tests. Genetic variability in responses to toxicants can occur in &quot;Lemna&quot;, and data are insufficient to recommend a specific clone for testing. The US EPA test uses aseptic technique. The OECD test is not conducted axenically, but steps are taken at stages during the test procedure to keep contamination by other organisms to a minimum. Depending on the objectives of the test and the regulatory requirements, testing may be performed with renewal (semistatic and flow-through) or without renewal (static) of the test solution. Renewal is useful for substances that are rapidly lost from solution as a result of volatilisation, photodegradation, precipitation, or biodegradation.

==Production of biopharmaceuticals==
&quot;Lemna&quot; has been transformed by molecular biologists to express proteins of pharmaceutical interest. Expression constructs were engineered to cause &quot;Lemna&quot; to secrete the transformed proteins into the growth medium at high yield. Since the &quot;Lemna&quot; is grown on a simple medium, this substantially reduces the burden of protein purification in preparing such proteins for medical use, promising substantial reductions in manufacturing costs. In addition, the host &quot;Lemna&quot; can be engineered to cause secretion of proteins with human patterns of glycosylation, an improvement over conventional plant gene-expression systems. Several such products are being developed, including monoclonal antibodies.

==Duckweed farming==
High yields of duckweed with a high protein content for use in human nutrition, animal and fish feed can be achieved by careful control of growth conditions. Although duckweed can tolerate temperatures ranging from to , the optimal growth range is to . The acceptable pH range is 5 to 9, but better growth is obtained in the pH range of 6.5 to 7.5. A minimum water depth of is desirable to prevent excessive temperature swings. High nitrogen levels, for example 20 mM urea, have provided a protein content in the range of 45% by dry weight. The water may typically contain 60 mg/L of soluble nitrogen and 1 mg/L of phosphorus. Fertiliser is required on a daily basis for optimal growth.
Duckweed can be farmed organically, with nutrients being supplied from a variety of sources, for example human urine, cattle manure, pig waste, biogas plant slurry, or other organic matter in slurry form. Because of the rapid growth of duckweed, daily harvesting is necessary to achieve optimal yields. Harvesting is done such that less than 1 kg/m2 of duckweed remains. Under optimal conditions, a duckweed farm can produce 10 to 30 tons of dried duckweed per hectare per year.

<text>Marie Joseph Gabriel Antoine Jogand-Pagès, better known by the pen name Léo Taxil (; March 21, 1854 – March 31, 1907), was a French writer and journalist who became known for his strong anti-Catholic and anti-clerical views. He is also known for the Taxil hoax, a spurious exposé of Freemasonry and the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s opposition to it.

==Early life==
Marie Joseph Gabriel Antoine Jogand-Pagès was born in Marseille, and at the age of five, he was placed into a Jesuit seminary. After spending his childhood years in the seminary, he became disillusioned with the Catholic faith and began to see the religious ideology as socially harmful. He also wrote some novels under the pseudonym Prosper Manin.

==&quot;La Bible amusante&quot;==
Taxil first became known for writing anti-Clerical or anti-Catholic books, notably &quot;La Bible amusante&quot; (&quot;The Amusing Bible&quot;) and &quot;La Vie de Jesus&quot; (&quot;The Life of Jesus&quot;), in which Taxil satirically pointed out perceived inconsistencies, errors, and false beliefs presented in these religious works. In his other books &quot;Les Débauches d&#x27;un confesseur&quot; (&quot;Debauchery of a Confessor&quot;, with Karl Milo), &quot;Les Pornographes sacrés: la confession et les confesseurs&quot; (&quot;Sacred Pornographs: confession and confessors&quot;), and &quot;Les Maîtresses du Pape&quot; (&quot;The Pope&#x27;s Mistresses&quot;), Taxil portrays leaders of the Catholic Church as hedonistic creatures exploring their fetishes in the manner of the Marquis de Sade. In 1879, he was tried at the Seine Assizes for writing a pamphlet &quot;A Bas la Calotte&quot; (&quot;Down with the Cloth&quot;), which was accused of insulting a religion recognized by the state, but he was acquitted.

==Taxil hoax==

In 1885, he professed conversion to Catholicism, was solemnly received into the church, and renounced his earlier works. In the 1890s, he wrote a series of pamphlets and books denouncing Freemasonry, charging their lodges with worshiping the devil and alleging that Diana Vaughan had written for him her confessions of the Satanic &quot;Palladist&quot; cult. The book had great sales among Catholics, although Diana Vaughan never appeared in public. In 1892, Taxil also began to publish a paper, &quot;La France chrétienne anti-maçonnique (Christian Antimasonic France)&quot;, with his staunch anti-Masonic publishing friend, Abel Clarin de la Rive. In 1887, he had an audience with Pope Leo XIII, who rebuked the bishop of Charleston for denouncing the anti-Masonic confessions as a fraud and, in 1896, sent his blessing to an anti-Masonic Congress of Trent.

Doubts about Vaughan&#x27;s veracity and even her existence began to grow, and finally, Taxil promised to produce her at a lecture to be delivered by him on 19 April 1897. To the amazement of the audience (which included a number of priests), he announced that Diana was one of a series of hoaxes.

He died in Sceaux in 1907.

<text>Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2 is a 2000 skateboarding video game developed by Neversoft for PlayStation, Vicarious Visions for Game Boy Advance, and Natsume for Game Boy Color. Published by Activision, it is the second installment in the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; series of sports games, and was released for the PlayStation in 2000, with subsequent ports to Windows and Dreamcast alongside a distinct version for Game Boy Color the same year. In 2001, the game was ported to Mac OS, Mac OS X, Nintendo 64, and Xbox (as part of &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2x&quot;), alongside a separate version for Game Boy Advance. The game was later ported to Windows Mobile and Windows Phone devices in 2006 and to iPhone OS devices in 2010.

&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot; uses the same game engine as its predecessor while improving the graphics and gameplay, most notably with the introduction of manuals and cash rewards. The game takes place in a three-dimensional urban environment permeated by an ambience of punk rock and hip hop music. The player takes control of a variety of skateboarders and either performs skateboarding tricks or collects certain objects. The game offers several modes of gameplay, including a career mode in which the player must complete objectives and evolve their character&#x27;s attributes with earned profits, a free-play mode in which the player may skate without any given objective, a multiplayer mode that features a number of competitive games, and a level editor that allows the player to create customized levels.

&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot; was critically acclaimed upon release and is considered one of the greatest video games ever created, as well as the highest-rated sports video game. All versions of the game were praised, with critics lauding its addictive gameplay, large environments, detailed graphics, fluid and precise controls, customization features and soundtrack, with some minor criticisms directed at the lack of a first-person camera and the truncated soundtrack of the Nintendo 64 version. A sequel, &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot;, was released in 2001.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot; puts the player in control of a professional or fictional skater and takes place in a third-person view with a fixed camera. The player must perform tricks and complete level objectives in return for cash rewards, which can be used to unlock other levels, improve the player character&#x27;s statistics and obtain better equipment. The game&#x27;s universe maintains a loose grip on physics for the sake of gameplay quality; while the player character can jump reasonable heights and perform short grinds early on in their career, they may eventually come to grind for much longer distances and reach such a disproportionate height in their jumps as to be capable of stringing an unrealistic chain of maneuvers together midair. The player can move freely throughout the levels without constraint and fulfill the different objectives in any order desired.

In &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot;, the player character is self-propelling and can have their course altered via the arrow keys or d-pad. The player character is capable of jumping and change direction midair. The game features a vast number of skateboarding tricks. One button can be used to switch footedness between &quot;regular&quot; or &quot;goofy&quot;, while another can initiate a nollie or a fakie. Passing from a nollie to a fakie (or vice versa) in a chain of tricks increases the multiplier factor of the score collected for that chain. Other button inputs can be used to perform slides, grabs, and flips. A series of inputs can be used to perform lip tricks. It is possible to perform and transfers (changing ramps) as well as manuals that allow several tricks to be chained together. The player must use directional input to maintain balance during a manual; in the &quot;2X&quot; port, balance is visually represented by a vertical scale that appears next to the player character.

The game features ten professional skateboarders, along with four unlockable original characters, depending on the version. Furthermore, the game features Spider-Man via a licensing deal with Marvel Comics. Additionally, the South Korean and other Asian versions featured the girl group Fin.K.L.

===Modes of play===
&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot; features five modes of gameplay: Career Mode, Free Skate, Single Session, Multiplayer and the Level Editor. The Career Mode is played as a series of levels of increasing difficulty. Each level has ten objectives to perform within a period of two minutes. Some objectives are found in all levels, such as accumulating a particular score, collecting letters of the word &quot;SKATE&quot; scattered throughout the level or seeking and obtaining a hidden videotape. Other objectives are more varied, such as making figures at specific locations, jumping to difficult places or collecting particular objects. Each completed objective is rewarded with cash, which can be used to improve skater statistics and obtain new equipment and playable characters.

A select few levels take place in a competition in which the player must perform for judges and accumulate the highest score within three one-minute rounds. The jury bases its score on the variety, difficulty and quality of the performed tricks. To fully complete these levels, the player must both accumulate a score high enough to win a gold medal and collect all the cash scattered within the level. The mode includes a series of small bonuses given for transfers, jumps and slides made across particular environmental elements. A list of these bonuses, referred to as &quot;gaps&quot;, are compiled in a checklist that is viewable from the game&#x27;s option menu. Other single-player modes include the Single Session, in which the player can freely accumulate a high score within two minutes using any previously obtained levels and characters, and the Free Skate, in which there is no time limit imposed.

The multiplayer mode consists of five types of games: &quot;Graffiti&quot;, &quot;Trick Attack&quot;, &quot;Tag&quot;, &quot;HORSE&quot; and &quot;Free Skate&quot;. In &quot;Graffiti&quot;, players must accumulate the highest score by changing level elements into their own color via the use of tricks. If a player performs a higher-scoring trick on an element that has already been marked, the element will change to that player&#x27;s color. &quot;Trick Attack&quot; is a mode in which players must accumulate the highest score by chaining tricks together. &quot;Tag&quot; is an interpretation of the traditional game of tag that gives each player a timer, which only counts down when they&#x27;ve been touched by the other player and are therefore &quot;it&quot;. The player who is &quot;it&quot; can decrease the speed of the other player and increase the ease in tagging them by performing tricks. The player who causes the other player&#x27;s timer to run out is the winner.

&quot;HORSE&quot; is a game that is played intermittently between two players, who must compete in rounds lasting either eight seconds or until a trick has been made. The player with the lower score on any given turn receives a letter in the word &quot;HORSE&quot; or whatever word the players had generated prior to the game&#x27;s start. The first player to accumulate the entire word loses. &quot;Free Skate&quot; allows the players to skate freely on the same level without any given goal.

The game&#x27;s Level Editor incorporates over 100 pieces and a variety of pre-built park bases. The construction of a level is initiated on a flat and empty canvas that can be rotated at any angle. The setting can be altered between themes such as a warehouse or park, and elemental pieces are rotatable and flexible in size.

===Featured pro skaters and characters===
The game features a total of thirteen real-life professional skateboarders, along with four unlockable original characters, depending on the version. Furthermore, the game features Spider-Man via a licensing deal with Marvel Comics. Additionally, the South Korean and other Asian versions featured the girl group Fin.K.L.

====Notes====

==Development==
By September 1999, Neversoft began to hire new programmers and designers for a sequel to its then-latest release &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot;. On October 4, Activision confirmed its acquisition of Neversoft. In April 2000, Activision began development of &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot; for the Nintendo 64, Game Boy Color, PlayStation, Dreamcast and PC platforms. The game made its first public appearance at the 2000 Electronic Entertainment Expo as a non-playable demonstration. A playable demonstration was subsequently integrated into the &quot;Jampack Summer 2K&quot; compilation CD released by &quot;PlayStation Underground&quot;. The game&#x27;s soundtrack lineup was unveiled on July 28 of the same year.

The game engine of &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot; is an enhanced version of that of its predecessor, which in turn used a modified version of the engine used in Neversoft&#x27;s earlier title &quot;Apocalypse&quot;. &quot;Pro Skater 2&quot; is the first installment in the series to feature a level editor, character customization and manuals; the latter was intended to be included in the previous game, but was not implemented due to time constraints.

On September 19, 2000, &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot; made its premiere the day before its wide release at the Best Buy in West Los Angeles. The event was attended by the game&#x27;s namesake Tony Hawk, who personally autographed copies of the game, and KROQ-FM disc jockey Jed the Fish, who played with guests competing for a variety of prizes. In order to give the Nintendo 64 version of the original &quot;Pro Skater&quot; more time to sell, Activision delayed the release of &quot;Pro Skater 2&quot;″s Nintendo 64 port to late-2001. In October 2001, Activision acquired Treyarch preceding the release of &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2x&quot;.

==Versions==
The original version of &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot; was developed for the PlayStation by Neversoft and was released in North America and Europe in September 2000. The game was re-released for the Greatest Hits lineup in North America and for the Platinum Range in Europe. The PlayStation version includes a demo of &quot;Mat Hoffman&#x27;s Pro BMX&quot; that is available from the options menu. The Dreamcast version was developed by Treyarch and was released in the United States in November 2000 and in Europe the following month.

The Dreamcast version features smoother textures and higher-quality animation than the PlayStation version. &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot;″s Nintendo 64 version was developed by Edge of Reality, who developed the Nintendo 64 port of the original &quot;Pro Skater&quot;, and was released in the United States on August and in Europe in October 2001. The Nintendo 64 version includes all of the features from the PlayStation version plus an additional level. While the game&#x27;s textures and frame rate are smoother than that of the PlayStation version, the soundtrack had been shortened to six tracks consisting of instrumental chorus loops due to limited storage capacity.

&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot; was ported to the PC by LTI Gray Matter and was released in North America in October 2000 and in Europe the following month. The PC version features improved textures and resolution over the PlayStation version. The South Korean release features Fin.K.L members Lee Hyori, Ock Joo-hyun, Lee Jin and Sung Yu-ri as playable characters and adds seven Fin.K.L songs to the game&#x27;s soundtrack. The Mac OS and Mac OS X versions were produced by Aspyr Media and developed by Westlake Interactive. It was released in the United States in May 2001. These versions are ported from and nearly identical to the PC version and features online multiplayer support via GameRanger.

&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot; was developed for the Game Boy Color by Natsume Co., Ltd. and was released in the United States and Europe in November 2000. The game features two modes of play (&quot;Career Mode&quot; and &quot;Free Skate&quot;), thirteen skaters, seven stages and a password system to aid in tracking the player&#x27;s progress. The Game Boy Color&#x27;s limited capacity necessitated a change in perspective to side-scrolling and isometric overhead levels and a completely synthesized soundtrack.

&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot; was developed for the Game Boy Advance by Vicarious Visions and released in the United States and Europe in June 2001 with launch of the Game Boy Advance. The game takes place in an isometric overhead perspective and features all levels and game modes excluding the level editor, multiplayer and skater-customization modes. Due to the console&#x27;s limited capacity, the game&#x27;s control scheme was simplified and the game had its own instrumental soundtrack.

An enhanced port of &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot; was released as a part of the Xbox title &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2x&quot;. It was developed by Treyarch and released in North America in November 2001. The compilation includes five new levels, redesigned menus, the ability to create female customized skaters and a customized soundtrack, a &quot;balance meter&quot; feature and a four-player and LAN compatibility in the multiplayer mode. The game&#x27;s graphics had been improved from those of the PC and Dreamcast versions; the textures were reworked to display more detail, most notably in the patches of grass.
A version for Windows Mobile devices was developed by Aspyr Media and released in April 2006. The port is optimized for the Intel 2700G processor found in Dell Axim devices. A port of &quot;Pro Skater 2&quot; for iOS devices was released by Activision on April 1, 2010. The version&#x27;s only playable modes were the Career, Single Session and Free Skate modes, and the soundtrack was remade. The game&#x27;s controls were visually displayed on the screen as four virtual buttons and a directional cross. The game was removed from the App Store in 2014.

An enhanced remake of both &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot; and the second game, titled &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 + 2&quot;, was developed by Vicarious Visions and released on September 4, 2020, for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One, followed up a year later on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch. The game includes all of the original levels and skaters from the original games, but also includes improved skater creation and park creation modes, online multiplayer, and other new features, and featured most of the original soundtracks.

==Reception==
===Critical reaction===
====Console and computer versions====
&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot; was met with universal critical acclaim upon release and remains the best-reviewed PlayStation video game of all time, as well as being the second highest rated game of all time behind &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot; with an aggregate score of 98/100 on Metacritic. Martin Taylor of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; declared the game to be &quot;the supreme champion of extreme sports gaming&quot;. Ben Silverman of Game Revolution considered the game&#x27;s &quot;excellent&quot; control to be &quot;what pushes [it] from great to fantastic&quot; and that on a visual level, the game &quot;looks better than about 90% of the Playstation games that have come before it&quot;.

David Smith of &quot;IGN&quot; praised the tightness of the game&#x27;s control as being in a &quot;rarefied&quot; category with games like &quot;Quake III&quot; and &quot;Soulcalibur&quot;. He also elaborated on the game&#x27;s graphical improvements over its predecessor, though noted the slightly unsatisfactory draw distance in the larger levels as a minor flaw. Jeff Gerstmann of &quot;GameSpot&quot; commended the large levels and the game&#x27;s ability to maintain a solid frame rate while handling them. The lack of a first-person camera view was lamented by Game Revolution&#x27;s Silverman and &quot;GameSpot&quot;&#x27;s Gerstmann.

The Nintendo 64 version was also positively reviewed, though less so than its PlayStation and Dreamcast counterparts. Fran Mirabella of &quot;IGN&quot; stated that Edge of Reality gave the best version of the game that the Nintendo 64 was capable of having. Justin Leeper of &quot;Game Informer&quot; noted that along with the original version&#x27;s strengths being successfully transposed, the reduced load times are an advantage of the Nintendo 64 port. Both Mirabella and Leeper judged the Nintendo 64 version&#x27;s graphics to be inferior to the PlayStation version due to the reduced draw distance and the blurred, seamed textures. In regards to the soundtrack, while both reviewers commended the effort to incorporate the licensed tracks onto a cartridge format, they concluded that the result came across as &quot;butchered&quot;.

Greg Orlando of &quot;Next Generation&quot; gave five stars out of five for PlayStation version, praising the graphics, gameplay, controls, soundtrack, and level editor.

====Handheld versions====
Martin Taylor of Eurogamer considered the Game Boy Advance version to be &quot;an impressive accomplishment&quot; and &quot;almost like a new game&quot;. Craig Harris of IGN noted that while the Game Boy Color version had &quot;serious&quot; gameplay problems, it was an improvement over its predecessor&#x27;s equivalent on the same platform.

Frank Provo of GameSpot referred to the Game Boy Color version&#x27;s gameplay as &quot;exquisite&quot; and praised the &quot;colorful and detailed&quot; environments and &quot;fluidly animating&quot; character sprites. Hillary Goldstein of IGN stated that the iOS version &quot;maintains the fun and challenge of the original&quot; in spite of its imperfect controls. Kristan Reed of Eurogamer considered the iOS port to be &quot;a surprisingly enjoyable conversion&quot;, though he noted the overly-faithful graphics, the struggling framerate on older iOS devices, the lack of a multiplayer mode and some soundtrack changes to be flaws.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; gave five stars out of five for the Game Boy Advance version of the game; they were surprised by its well executed translation of the original game for GBA platform.

<doc id="736184" wikidata="Q547078" url="?curid=736184" title="W. S. Van Dyke">
<text>Woodbridge Strong Van Dyke II (March 21, 1889 – February 5, 1943) was an American film director who made several successful early sound films, including &quot;Tarzan the Ape Man&quot; in 1932, &quot;The Thin Man&quot; in 1934, &quot;San Francisco&quot; in 1936, and six popular musicals with Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald. He received two Academy Award nominations for Best Director for &quot;The Thin Man&quot; and &quot;San Francisco&quot;, and directed four actors to Oscar nominations: William Powell, Spencer Tracy, Norma Shearer, and Robert Morley. Known as a reliable craftsman who made his films on schedule and under budget, he earned the name &quot;One Take Woody&quot; for his quick and efficient style of filming.

==Early life==
Van Dyke was born on March 21, 1889, in San Diego, California. His father was a superior court judge who died the day his son was born. His mother, Laura Winston, returned to her former acting career. As a child actor, Van Dyke appeared with his mother on the vaudeville circuit with traveling stock companies. They traveled the west coast and into the Middle West. When he was five years old, they appeared at the old San Francisco Grand Opera House in &quot;Blind Girl&quot;. He would later remember his unusual education,

I think I&#x27;ve been to school in every state in the Union. Whenever the company stopped off long enough in any city I went back behind a school desk. The rest of the time my mother taught me.

When Van Dyke was fourteen years old, he moved to Seattle to live with his grandmother. While attending business school, he worked several part-time jobs, including janitor, waiter, salesman, and railroad attendant. Van Dyke&#x27;s early adult years were unsettled, and he moved among jobs. On June 16, 1909, he married actress Zine Bertha Ashford (November 3, 1887 - October 2, 1951), whose screen name was &quot;Zelda Ashford,&quot; in Pierce, Washington, and the two joined various touring theater companies, finally arriving in Hollywood in 1915.

==Career==
In 1915, Van Dyke found work as an assistant director to D. W. Griffith on the film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;. The following year, he was Griffith&#x27;s assistant director on &quot;Intolerance&quot;. That same year he worked as an assistant director to James Young on &quot;Unprotected&quot; (1916), &quot;The Lash&quot; (1916), and the lost film &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, in which he also played the role of Charles Dickens.

In 1917, Van Dyke directed his first film, &quot;The Land of Long Shadows&quot;, for Essanay Studios. That same year he directed five other films: &quot;The Range Boss&quot;, &quot;Open Places&quot;, &quot;Men of the Desert&quot;, &quot;Gift O&#x27; Gab&quot;, and &quot;Sadie Goes to Heaven&quot;. In 1927, he traveled to Tacoma to direct two silent films for the new H.C. Weaver Productions: &quot;Eyes of the Totem&quot; and &quot;The Heart of the Yukon&quot; (the latter is considered a lost film). According to Tim McCoy in his autobiography, Van Dyke, who directed him in &quot;War Paint&quot; and five others for MGM in the late 1920s, was eventually to become a giant among Hollywood&#x27;s creative geniuses. McCoy went on to say, &quot;For in addition to being annoyingly arrogant, maddeningly self-opinionated, damned sure of himself and utterly ruthless, Van was truly a great director.&quot; McCoy went on to say, &quot;he (Van Dyke) evidenced a degree of concern for my well-being on a par with the level of compassion that might have been exhibited by a nineteenth-century Arab slaver herding a batch of the lately damned across the equator.&quot; He then told a similar story, which Robert Cannom&#x27;s Van Dyke biography mentioned in some detail, but lacking Cannom&#x27;s sugar-coated retelling. An extra fired a blank round too close to McCoy&#x27;s face, knocking him off his horse and causing pain and a wound needing hospitalization. McCoy said that Van Dyke cursed him soundly for falling off his horse and ruining the shot. He asked him if he was ready for another shot and then cautioned McCoy &quot;to try to do it right.&quot;

During the silent era he learned his craft and by the advent of the talkies was one of MGM&#x27;s most reliable directors. He came to be known as &quot;One-Take Woody&quot; or &quot;One-Take Van Dyke&quot;, for the speed with which he would complete his assignments. MGM regarded him as one of the most versatile, equally at home directing costume dramas, westerns, comedies, crime melodramas, and musicals.

Many of his films were huge hits and topped the box office in any given year. He received Academy Award for Best Director nominations for &quot;The Thin Man&quot; (1934) and &quot;San Francisco&quot; (1936). He also directed the Oscar-winning classic &quot;Eskimo&quot; (also known as &quot;Mala the Magnificent&quot;), in which he also has a featured acting role.

His other films include the island adventure &quot;White Shadows in the South Seas&quot; (1928); its follow-up, &quot;The Pagan&quot; (1929); &quot;Trader Horn&quot; (1931), which was filmed almost entirely in Africa; &quot;Tarzan the Ape Man&quot; (1932); &quot;Manhattan Melodrama&quot; (1934); and &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (1938). He is perhaps best remembered, however, for directing Myrna Loy and William Powell in four &quot;Thin Man&quot; films: &quot;The Thin Man&quot; (1934), &quot;After the Thin Man&quot; (1936), &quot;Another Thin Man&quot; (1939), and &quot;Shadow of the Thin Man&quot; (1941); and Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy in six of their greatest hits, &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot; (1935), &quot;Rose Marie&quot; (1936), &quot;Sweethearts&quot; (1938), &quot;New Moon&quot; (1940) (uncredited because halfway through filming Robert Z. Leonard took over), &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot; (1940), and &quot;I Married an Angel&quot; (1942).

The earthquake sequence in &quot;San Francisco&quot; is considered one of the best special-effects sequences ever filmed. To help direct, Van Dyke called upon his early mentor, D. W. Griffith, who had fallen on hard times. Van Dyke was also known to hire old-time, out-of-work actors as extras. Because of his loyalty, he was much beloved and admired in the industry.

Van Dyke was known for allowing ad-libbing (that remained in the film) and for coaxing natural performances from his actors. He made stars of Nelson Eddy, James Stewart, Myrna Loy, Johnny Weissmuller, Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan, Eleanor Powell, Ilona Massey, and Margaret O&#x27;Brien. He was often called in to work a few days (or more), uncredited, on a film that was in trouble or had gone over the production schedule.

Van Dyke was commissioned a captain in the United States Marine Corps Reserve in 1934. On September 13, 1935, he was promoted to the rank of major in the reserves. Prior to World War II, the patriotic Van Dyke set up a Marine Corps Reserve recruiting office in his own office at MGM. His rank of major often showed up in his later film credits, and he was influential in encouraging other MGM stars to join the military during the early days of the war, including Clark Gable, James Stewart, and Robert Taylor.

==Final years and death==
By 1933 Van Dyke had a 3 acre estate in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, on 334 South Bundy Drive, which he added on to several times to accommodate his collection of artifacts from world travel and allow large groups of friends for entertainment purposes. The house was razed by the early 1960s and the grounds were converted by 1965 into a cul-de-sac named Rose Marie Lane with eight large sized homes.

In the latter half of 1942, despite being ill with cancer and a bad heart, Van Dyke managed to direct one last film, &quot;Journey for Margaret&quot;, which premiered in New York City on December 17 that year. It is a heart-rending movie that made 5-year-old Margaret O&#x27;Brien an overnight star.

Van Dyke, a devout Christian Scientist, had refused most medical treatments and care during his final years. Following the general release of &quot;Journey for Margaret&quot; to theaters in January 1943, he said his goodbyes to his wife Ruth Elizabeth Mannix, his three children, and to studio boss Louis B. Mayer and then committed suicide on February 5 in Brentwood, Los Angeles. Both Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, in accordance with Van Dyke&#x27;s wishes, sang and officiated at his funeral.

His cremated remains are interred at Glendale&#x27;s Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, with those of his mother, Laura Winston Van Dyke in the Great Mausoleum, Columbarium of the Sanctuaries, Niche 10212.

== Family ==
W. S. Van Dyke&#x27;s mother, Laura Winston Van Dyke, was an enthusiastic genealogist and made sure he had known his own family history. He subsequently joined a number of male hereditary societies based in Los Angeles. He was a member of the National Society Sons of the American Revolution having joined on September 22, 1933, No. 53277, California Society No. CA 1707 based on a documented direct descent from John Honeyman (1729–1822), aide to General James Wolfe in the French and Indian Wars and later a spy for George Washington during the Revolution. That same year, 1933, he joined the Sons of the Revolution in the State of California on the same documented descent from John Honeyman, Membership No. 1847. He also became a member of the Order of Founders and Patriots, No. 7141, CA 48, in 1933 documenting descent from Jan Van Dyke (1709–1778), who was killed while fighting beside Washington at Monmouth, and Thomasse Janse Van Dyke (1581–1665). Van Dyke ultimately was invited to become a life member in the most difficult to join, Society of Colonial Wars, #8634, California Society #397, admitted January 23, 1934. He joined on a direct descent from Capt. Jan Janse Van Dyke (1652–1736) and Governor William Leete (1613–1683). He was the great great grandson of Abraham Van Dyke (1753–1804), who was with Washington at Morristown. Van Dyke was admitted to membership in the Barons of Runnymede, now known as Baronial Order of Magna Charta in January 1935, Member No. 441, and Military Order of the Crusades in December 1935, Member No. 13 both based on a descent from Governor Thomas Dudley of Massachusetts.

Marcia Van Dyke, violinist and actress, was a cousin of W. S. Van Dyke.

==Legacy==
Van Dyke and his career were the subject of a 424-page well-detailed biography published in 1948 by Robert C. Cannom which made use of extensive interviews with Van Dyke&#x27;s co-workers and had the complete cooperation of Metro Goldwyn Mayer. The author was allowed full access to Van Dyke&#x27;s files and photographs archived with the studio in Culver City, Calif.

January 20, 1937, Van Dyke and Clark Gable had their signature, hand and shoe print impressions cast in greenish cement at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard.

On February 8, 1960, Van Dyke received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contribution to Motion Pictures, at 6141 Hollywood Boulevard.

<text>Multiplicity is a 1996 American science fiction comedy film starring Michael Keaton and Andie MacDowell about a man able to duplicate himself by machine, each duplicate developing a different personality, causing problems. It was based on Chris Miller&#x27;s short story of the same name, published in &quot;National Lampoon&quot; magazine. The film was co-produced and directed by Harold Ramis. The original music score was composed by George Fenton.

The film was released July 17, 1996. It received mixed reviews from critics, and grossed a worldwide total of $37 million at the box office, significantly less than its $45 million budget.

== Plot ==
Doug Kinney works in construction in Los Angeles, and his job constantly gets in the way of his family. Working on a new wing of a scientific facility, Doug meets Dr. Leeds, a scientist who developed a method for cloning humans. He is introduced to Dr. Leeds&#x27; clone as proof. Sympathetic to Doug&#x27;s troubles, Dr. Leeds clones him, so the clone can take over for Doug at work, while the original tries to spend time with his family. &quot;Two&quot;, a clone who calls himself &quot;Lance&quot;, has all of Doug&#x27;s memories and knowledge, but is also an exaggeration of Doug&#x27;s masculine side.

Doug tries to keep his clone a secret. While he and his wife Laura are at a restaurant for dinner, he sees Two on his own date. Doug begins to worry about his clone being revealed.

Despite the complications of having a clone, Lance is extremely busy at work, so Doug has another made to help out at home. &quot;Three&quot;, who calls himself &quot;Rico&quot;, is an exaggeration of Doug&#x27;s feminine side. He is sensitive and thoughtful and loves to cook and take care of the house, much to Lance&#x27;s chagrin.

Lance and Rico attempt to make another clone, &quot;Four&quot;, who is later named Lenny. Since he is a clone-of-a-clone (and a copy of a copy may not be as &#x27;sharp&#x27; as the original), his intelligence is lower than that of his predecessors, yet Lenny represents an exaggeration of Doug&#x27;s immature side, and he refers to Doug as &quot;Steve&quot;. Annoyed, Doug decrees that no more clones be created.

Doug decides to take some time off, going on a sailing trip. He does not want Laura to know, so he has his clones step in for him while he is away. Although he instructs them that Laura is off limits, while he is gone each of the clones run into Laura. Despite their best efforts to follow instructions, she persists and eventually has sex with all three of them, thinking they are Doug.

The next day, Lance has a cold and cannot go to work, so he sends Rico. During an inspection on site, Rico&#x27;s ignorance about the current construction site annoys the inspector, which leads to Doug losing his job.

Laura becomes increasingly upset with her husband&#x27;s erratic behavior and how he has no memories of discussions she unwittingly had with another clone. Thinking Doug is ignoring her, she reveals her feelings to Lenny, mentioning how Doug has never kept his promise to fix up the house. When she asks him what he wants, an inattentive Lenny replies, &quot;I want pizza&quot;. Upset, she takes the children and moves back to her parents&#x27; home.

After finding out everything that has happened while he was away, Doug tries to determine how to get Laura back. Lenny tells him that Laura said he never fixed the house. With the help of the clones, Doug remodels their home and wins back Laura&#x27;s love. He also tells her he is planning to start his own contracting business. Realizing Doug can take care of himself now, the clones move away. As they are driving away, Laura sees them in the car next to her. Believing that she is hallucinating, Laura tells her children that you can tell you really love someone when everyone you see reminds you of them.

The clones write to Doug that they have set up a successful pizzeria called &quot;Three Guys from Nowhere&quot; in Miami, Florida, and masquerade as triplets. Lance becomes the businessman of the shop and serves customers, enjoying this opportunity to meet women. Rico is the head chef and is &quot;cooking up a storm and having a ball&quot;, and Lenny is both the delivery boy and a paperboy. But because of his limited intellect, he confuses the two jobs, and the movie ends with him delivering a pizza by throwing it, newspaper-style.

==Production==
In January 1993, it was reported Columbia Pictures was in the process of acquiring &quot;Multiplicity&quot;, a script from husband and wife writing team Chris Miller and Mary Hale and based on a short story by Miller published in &quot;National Lampoon&quot;. Harold Ramis tried to convince Tom Hanks to star in the film.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was released July 17 and ranked seventh at the US box office that weekend. The film was not a success at the box office, grossing a total of $21,075,014 in the United States and Canada, less than half of its $45 million budget, and $36.9 million worldwide. The Olympic Games was blamed for the poor opening weekend, and &quot;Independence Day&quot; held on to the number one position. John Krier, head of Exhibitor Relations, disagreed that the Olympics were to blame, instead saying competition from other films were the cause since total grosses were the same as the previous year. &quot;Multiplicity&quot; was competing for the same audience as Eddie Murphy&#x27;s &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;.

===Critical response===
&quot;Multiplicity&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 45% based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;This high-concept experiment only proves that a comedy actually can have too much Michael Keaton.&quot; Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; gave the film 2.5 out of 4, and wrote: &quot;&quot;Groundhog Day&quot; had a certain sweetness and even a sly philosophical depth, but &quot;Multiplicity&quot; is more of a ground-level comedy, in which we can usually anticipate the problems for Doug and his clones.&quot;

===Home media===
The film was released to DVD on April 15, 1998.

&quot;Multiplicity&quot; was released in widescreen on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in May 2012. The DVD is compatible with region code 4, and includes special features such as the theatrical trailer and crew biographies.

<text>André Schiffrin (June 14, 1935 – December 1, 2013) was a French-American author, publisher and socialist.

== Life ==
Schiffrin was born in Paris, the son of Jacques Schiffrin, a Russian Jew who emigrated to France and briefly enjoyed success there as publisher of the &quot;Bibliothèque de la Pléiade&quot;, which he founded, and which was bought by Gallimard, until he was dismissed because of the anti-Jewish laws enforced by the Vichy regime. Jacques Schiffrin and his family had to flee and eventually found refuge in the United States. As the younger Schiffrin recalls in his autobiography, &quot;A Political Education: Coming of Age in Paris and New York&quot; (2007), he thus experienced life in two countries as a child of a European Jewish intellectual family. He attended Yale University, where he won the Alpheus Henry Snow Prize, and Clare College, Cambridge, where he studied English on a Mellon Fellowship for two years and edited the student literary magazine &quot;Granta&quot;.

As a socialist, Schiffrin opposed both the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and the U.S. war in Vietnam. He was one of the founders of the Student League for Industrial Democracy (1946-1959), the organization that became Students for a Democratic Society. In 1968, he signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.

Schiffrin was the managing director of publishing at Pantheon Books, where he was partially responsible for introducing the works of Pasternak, Foucault and others to American readers. Schiffrin&#x27;s 28-year period at Pantheon, a division of Random House, came to an end in 1990 when CEO Alberto Vitale sacked him because of a conflict over the division&#x27;s losses and the downsizing that Vitale wished to make.

In 1992 Schiffrin, with former Pantheon colleague Diane Wachtell, established the non-profit The New Press, explaining that he did so because of economic trends that prevented him from publishing the serious books he thought should be made available. Schiffrin discussed what he regarded as the crisis in western publishing in his book &quot;The Business of Books: How the International Conglomerates Took Over Publishing and Changed the Way We Read&quot; (2000).

In 2011, Schiffrin was made a Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur by the French government.

Schiffrin&#x27;s daughter, journalist Anya Schiffrin, is married to the economist and Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz. His daughter Natalia is married to international lawyer Philippe Sands.

Schiffrin died on December 1, 2013, in Paris from pancreatic cancer.

<doc id="736213" wikidata="Q838944" url="?curid=736213" title="Red-shanked douc">
<text>The red-shanked douc (Pygathrix nemaeus) is an arboreal and diurnal Old World monkey belonging to the Colobinae subfamily. They are endemic to Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. They are known for their bright colors and exhibit sexual dimorphism through their body size. The species has been declared critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, with the main threats being: hunting, habitat loss and pet trade. They are one of three species in the genus &quot;Pygathrix&quot;, the other two being the black-shanked (&quot;P. nigripes&quot;) and gray-shanked (&quot;P. cinerea&quot;) doucs.

Red-shanked doucs live in fission-fusion, multilevel societies that have a mean of 18 individuals per band. They are folivorous and consume mainly &quot;Acacia pruinescens, Ficus racemosa, Millettia nigrescens, Zanthoxylum avicennae&quot; and &quot;Castanopsis ceratacantha&quot;. Their four-chambered stomachs that allow for bacterial fermentation help them with their high-fiber diet.

==Geographic range and habitat==
The red-shanked douc is native to Indochina; Vietnam, southern Laos, and possibly northeastern Cambodia, east of the Mekong river. Before 1967, the douc was completely unstudied. It is the only douc species that inhabits all three countries of Indochina. In Laos, red-shanked doucs occur from the southern Nam Ghong Provincial Protected Area to the central-north part of the country. Laos is believed to have the largest population of red-shanked doucs, with Nakai-Nam Theun National Protected Area in central Laos having the most individuals of approximately 4,420 groups, followed by the Hin Namno National Protected Area. In Vietnam, the species lives between Nghệ An and Gia Lai provinces, from 18°29&#x27;N to 14°21&#x27;N. The Sơn Trà Nature Reserve on Sơn Trà Mountain in central Vietnam holds the greatest Vietnamese population with approximately 700–1300 individuals. The Phong Nha – Kẻ Bàng National Park is also an important Vietnamese site for the species. 

There was one observation of the red-shanked doucs in Cambodia by Rawson and Ross in 2008 in the Ratanakiri Province at the border of Vietnam. There was a report of a red-shanked douc specimen that was given to the Staatliches Museum by the Dresden Zoological Garden who had said that it originated in Hainan, China but the zoo records no longer exist so it remains uncertain.

Red-shanked doucs are found in evergreen, semi-evergreen and occasionally limestone forests, up to in elevation. They are arboreal and spend most of their time in the forest canopy, including to sleep. They occasionally get on the ground to drink water or eat dirt that contains minerals. According to an ecological niche model, red-shanked doucs can live between approximately 14°N to 21°N. Their home range is approximately and they have a core area of , with a smaller range in the dry season of and a larger range in the wet season of . There are weak correlations between precipitation, temperature, and diet and home range but not enough to draw conclusions from them.

==Characteristics==
Like other Doucs, the red-shanked douc is a long, slender monkey. The male has a head and body length of with a tail that measures , and the female is between long with a tail that measures long. Males weigh , and females .

The red-shanked douc are among the most colorful primates. They are considered &quot;Queen of primates&quot; thanks to their distinctive and unique appearance. They have agouti hair on their crown, temples, inner thighs, ventral coat, nape of the neck, back, triceps and lateral sides of their arms. Their crown is silver, their temples are red hair and their foreheads are black. They have white whiskers that are approximately 12 cm long for adult males. Their eyes have a high axis. The fur on their cheeks and on their throat is white. Their collar is orange with black from one shoulder to the other. Their face is a yellow-brown color and they have light blue eyelids. Their inner arms and inner, lateral and back thighs are black while their lower legs are a vibrant red. Their abdomen and back are silver yet their sacral area is white. Both feet and hands are black as well as their nipples. Their tails are white and are oftentimes equal in length to their head and body length.

The coloration gradually becomes less vibrant and having smaller red patches with more southern latitudes. In Nam Ghong Provincial Protected Area in Laos, red-shanked doucs only have small red patches around their ankles.

Although minor, the red-shanked doucs are sexually dimorphic with respect to body size but not coloration. There is a slight difference in rump markings between males and females; the male has round white spots above the triangle of white on his rump, while the female does not. Males of all ages have a white spot on both sides of the corners of the rump patch, and red and white genitals. 

==Behavior==
This monkey communicates using facial expressions. It has a specific &quot;play face&quot; with the mouth open, teeth partially bared and chin thrust forward. Sometimes, it closes its eyes and paws blindly towards another douc without regard for the hazards of doing so when up a tree. A fixed stare is a threat display. A grimace with the mouth open and the teeth exposed is a submissive gesture given in response to a stare and is also used to initiate grooming or play. The red-shanked douc has a low-pitched growl that is given as a threat, and a short, harsh distress squeal. During adult play, they perform an eyelid display where they blink their eyes open and closed to show their light blue eyelids.

They are a fairly peaceful species and agonistic behavior has been very rarely reported. In the San Diego Zoo, researchers observed that in the instances where there was agonistic behavior, it only lasted a few seconds and did not result in injury. Grooming lasts up to an hour and is most commonly found between adult females. In captivity, young red-shanked doucs groom and care for infants, showing signs of alloparental care.

The activity budget of wild red-shanked doucs is rest at 35.3%, movement at 28.6%, socializing at 21.7%, feeding at 13.7% and self-grooming at 0.7%.

===Group composition===
Red-shanked doucs live in multilevel, fission-fusion societies in one-male/multi-female or multi-male/multi-female groups with a male-to-female ratio of 1.0:1.63 and an adult-to-young ratio of 1.1:1.0. The bands contain a mean of 18 individuals in a mean of 2.7 units per band and a mean of 6.5 individuals per unit. Groups of up to 50 have been recorded. Group size changes according to the season. Both males and females have their own hierarchies and males are dominant to females. Both males and females will eventually leave the group they were born into.

Red-shanked doucs fuse overnight and fission during mornings and early afternoons. When they are fused, they rest more and when they fission, they are more active.

There does not seem to be any difference in daily fission-fusion from wet to dry season yet overall fission-fusion events increase during part of the wet season, from October to December. In a study at the Sơn Trà Nature Reserve, 55.32% of their observations were fusion events and 44.68% were fission events. This behavior is believed to help with regulating feeding competition. Red-shanked doucs are very inflexible with membership into their groups.

==Locomotion==
In captivity, red-shanked doucs use brachiation for almost half of their locomotion whereas, in the wild, arm-swinging accounts for an average of 18% of locomotion. Juveniles use arm-swinging the most (34.3%), followed by subadults (21.7%), adult females (17.6%), adult females carrying infants (15.5%), and then adult males (9.8%). This showed that with increased body weight there is a decreased amount of brachiation.

When they travel by foot, their tail will usually hang down. Like all other Old World monkeys, its tail is not prehensile. It uses its tail solely for balance, and it uses its arms and legs to move through the forest along established routes. When on the move, the group is led by adult males, with juvenile males bringing up the rear and the females and infants staying safe in the middle. This douc is an aerial specialist, moving high up in the canopy. It is very agile and frequently makes breath-taking leaps of up to 6 meters (20 feet), leaping with its arms outstretched over its head, pushing off with its legs and landing on two feet.

When the group is untroubled, the red-shanked douc will move noisily from branch to branch through the forest, crashing through foliage, swinging under branches and leaping with two feet together, displaying its remarkable sense of balance. But when a group is disturbed, by either a predator or other dangers, it can flee silently through the trees, away from danger. If it is startled, it may produce loud barks and rush around the trees slapping branches with its hands and feet.

==Mating and development==
===Mating===
In captivity, female red-shanked doucs reach sexual maturity at four years old and males at four years and eight months. Mating occurs all year but has peaks between August-December. Mating is initiated by both sexes jutting their jaw forward, raising and lowering their eyebrows, shaking their head and squinting their eyes. Copulation occurs after the female crouches and presents her sex organ to the male. Single-mount and multiple-mount matings have been reported. Copulation can still happen while the female is pregnant. Female red-shanked doucs go into estrus every 28–30 days and with it, there is a reddening of their rump.

===Menstruation and pregnancy===
Female doucs have an average menstrual cycle of 26.4 days, with their follicular phase lasting an average of 13.1 days and their luteal phase lasting 14.8 days. Estradiol and estrone are the main types of estrogen present in female red-shanked doucs.

Births occur year-round but peak between August and October and again between February and April. The birth interval is between 16–38 months. The gestation period lasts between 165 and 210 days, resulting in the birth of a single offspring or very rarely, twins. In captivity, it was observed that the pregnant female will find a high place in the enclosure to give birth. The head of the infant emerges after 90 minutes of labour which is followed by the placenta that weighs 90–120g. The oldest recorded birth was from a 26 year old female.

===Development===
The young are born with their eyes open and they latch on to their mothers instinctively. The baby&#x27;s body coloration is lighter than an adult&#x27;s. Its face is more of a blue color and the body is a lighter beige. As it grows older, its body darkens while its face lightens, achieving adult colors at 10 months. In captivity, other group members may look after an infant, and other females may even suckle it. In one study, an orphaned infant was fed by two females in the group and also cared for by a male. The first six months of a red-shanked douc&#x27;s life is the most challenging. In captivity, they can live for up to 25 years.

==Diet==
Red-shanked doucs are highly folivorous. In the Sơn Trà Nature Reserve found they consume 54.8% buds and young leaves, 22.6% mature leaves, 3.7% leaf petioles and 18.9% other plant parts. Per month, they found that the red-shanked doucs consumed a mean of 18 species per month and a total of 226 species consumed altogether. Out of the 226 species, there are five species that were eaten 47–82% of the time: &quot;Acacia pruinescens, Ficus racemosa, Millettia nigrescens, Zanthoxylum avicennae&quot; and &quot;Castanopsis ceratacantha.&quot; Red-shanked doucs are selective feeders and flexible eaters because of their ability to eat a wide variety of food in all seasons. Fruit is consumed mainly in the morning, which is common amongst leaf-eating monkeys as this is where they derive their energy for the day. 

They have different eating patterns during the wet season and the dry season both in what they eat and in the parts of the plants that they eat, although it is not a drastic change. Figs however, are consumed all year long and make up 16–36% of their diet. It is the second most commonly consumed plant by the monkeys and they eat the fruit, leaves and flowers.

They eat peacefully together, not quarreling over food, and have been known to share their food with others. Often, they will share the same clump of foliage and may even break pieces off and hand them to each other, a type of active generosity that is rare among Old World monkeys. Like all other doucs, they do not have cheek pouches.

==Conservation==
In 2000, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species classified the red-shanked douc langur as endangered. In 2020, the IUCN updated their classification of the species to critically endangered, due to the population’s continual decline. It was also listed in the Vietnam Red Book in 2007. In 2019, the Vietnamese prime minister classified them as a high-risk species that needs protection, in Decree 06. The species is listed in CITES I, which prohibits commercial international trade. More than half of the species has been lost in the past 30–40 years.

The main threat to the red-shanked douc is from hunting. Their meat is used for food, traditional medicine, and for international sale or trade. Local people often hunt the species for consumption, pets, or making glue. Although hunting of the species is technically illegal, it is not strictly enforced and has little effect. In the Dong Ampham National Protected Area in Laos, on the border with Vietnam, local hunters have estimated that approximately fifty red-shanked doucs are killed each year. From 2015 to 2018, the Bach Ma National Park Forestry Protection department in Vietnam confiscated 13 kg of red-shanked douc meat. Their behavioral characteristics are believed to make the species particularly easy to hunt. Vietnam has the highest hunting levels of the species.

Their other main threats are pet trade, habitat fragmentation, creation of agricultural land, and military installations.

With Laos having the biggest population of red-shanked doucs, the country has been marked as being the most important for the species&#x27; conservation. A study conducted by Camille N. Z. Coudrat et al. stated that the best approach to conserving the monkeys is to focus on the largest populations, specifically in Laos. At present, there is no conservation effort in that country. There have been efforts to breed red-shanked doucs in captivity since the late 1960s, but they are difficult to keep in zoos due to factors such as their diet, so currently, there are only 33 individuals in captivity worldwide.

Habitat loss in Sơn Trà due to development plans poses a high risk to the monkeys. Historically, Sơn Trà had a military installation, so many animals in the region were shot as practice targets. Currently, the red-shanked doucs in Sơn Trà Nature Reserve are protected by the army, police and forest protection departments of Da Nang and Sơn Trà.

<text>Droopy is an animated character from the golden age of American animation. He is an anthropomorphic white Basset Hound with a droopy face. He was created in 1943 by Tex Avery for theatrical cartoon shorts produced by the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio. Essentially the polar opposite of Avery&#x27;s other MGM character, the loud and wacky Screwy Squirrel, Droopy moves slowly and lethargically, speaks in a jowly monotone voice, and—though hardly an imposing character—is shrewd enough to outwit his enemies. When finally roused to anger, often by a bad guy laughing heartily at him, Droopy is capable of beating adversaries many times his size with a comical thrashing.

The character first appeared, nameless, in Avery&#x27;s 1943 cartoon &quot;Dumb-Hounded&quot;. Though he was not called &quot;Droopy&quot; onscreen until his fifth cartoon, &quot;Señor Droopy&quot; (1949), the character was already named &quot;Droopy&quot; in model sheets for his first cartoon. He was officially first labeled &quot;Happy Hound&quot;, a name used in the character&#x27;s appearances in &quot;Our Gang Comics&quot;. He starred in 24 theatrical cartoons, ending in 1958 when MGM closed its cartoon department. The character has been revived several times for new productions including films and television shows also featuring MGM&#x27;s other famous cartoon stars, Tom and Jerry, either as their ally or enemy. He&#x27;s also known to be the guider of Cartoon Network back when it first launched at October 1, 1992.

In the cartoon &quot;Northwest Hounded Police&quot;, Droopy&#x27;s last name was given as &quot;McPoodle&quot;. In &quot;The Chump Champ&quot;, it was given as &quot;Poodle&quot;. Nevertheless, Droopy is generally understood to be a Basset Hound.

==History==
===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===
Droopy first appeared in the MGM cartoon &quot;Dumb-Hounded&quot;, released on March 20, 1943. Droopy&#x27;s first scene is when he saunters into view, looks at the audience, and declares, &quot;Hello, all you happy people ... you know what? I&#x27;m the hero.&quot; In the cartoon, Droopy is tracking an escaped convict and is always waiting for the crook wherever he turns up. Avery had used a similar gag in his &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; short &quot;Tortoise Beats Hare&quot; (1941) starring Bugs Bunny, which in turn was an expansion/exaggeration of the premise of his &quot;The Blow Out&quot; (1936) with Porky Pig. In fact, this cartoon shows that early ideas about Droopy&#x27;s personality were already germinating, as that film&#x27;s Cecil Turtle has similarities to Droopy.

Droopy&#x27;s meek, deadpan voice and personality were modeled after the character Wallace Wimple on the radio comedy &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot;; actor Bill Thompson, who played Wimple, was the original voice of Droopy. During his time in the US Navy during World War II, the role was played by other voice actors, including Don Messick, who reprised the role in the 1990s. Avery&#x27;s preferred gag man Heck Allen said that Avery himself provided the voice on several occasions, and &quot;You couldn&#x27;t tell the difference.&quot; Droopy himself was a versatile actor: he could play a Mountie, a cowboy, a deputy, an heir, or a Dixieland-loving everyday Joe with equal ease. The same voice was used for Big Heel-Watha in the Screwy Squirrel cartoon of the same name and for a Pilgrim who chases a turkey modeled after Jimmy Durante in Avery&#x27;s 1945 short &quot;Jerky Turkey&quot;.

One of Droopy&#x27;s more surprising traits is his incredible strength, given his diminutive stature and unassuming looks and personality, but this was usually reserved for when he was upset (with a few rare exceptions, where he very easily moved his adversary without harming him), at which time he would say in a monotone voice &quot;You know what? That makes me mad&quot; prior to thrashing the hapless villain of the piece. One such occasion was in &quot;Señor Droopy&quot;, where he did this to a bull. It happened again in &quot;One Droopy Knight&quot;, where a dragon was Droopy&#x27;s victim. In the second case, he also broke the dragon&#x27;s tail off and knocked him very far away with it like a baseball bat (apparently, it regenerated like a lizard&#x27;s tail, given the unharmed dragon later became Droopy&#x27;s servant/pet). This was also once done by a baby version of Droopy in the Western-themed short &quot;Homesteader Droopy&quot;. One example of Droopy showing his strength without being provoked was in &quot;The Chump Champ&quot; in which Spike (as &quot;Gorgeous Gorillawitz&quot;) stuffs an anvil in a speed bag. Droopy easily punches the bag several times but when Spike takes a swipe at it, half of him shatters to the ground. Another running gag that occurred during many of Droopy&#x27;s cartoons was whenever Droopy&#x27;s adversaries chopped down a tree. As the tree started coming down and was about to crush the unsuspecting Droopy, the adversary would run far the opposite way, point to the sky, and shout, &quot;TIM...&quot;. Then, in a moment of surprise, the tree would change direction and end up crushing the adversary instead and he would finish by saying, &quot;...ber&quot; while still pointing to the sky with a look of confusion on his face.
In most of his cartoons, Droopy matches wits with either a slick anthropomorphic Wolf (the Wolf character &quot;portrays&quot; the crooks in both &quot;Dumb-hounded&quot; and its semi-remake, &quot;Northwest Hounded Police&quot; (1946)) or a bulldog named &quot;Spike&quot;, sometimes silent, sometimes sporting a Gaelic accent. Two Droopy cartoons – &quot;The Shooting of Dan McGoo&quot; and &quot;Wild and Woolfy&quot; – also feature appearances from the curvy cutie of Avery&#x27;s &quot;Red Hot Riding Hood&quot; (1943) as a damsel in distress being pursued by the Wolf. Three later Droopy cartoons –&quot;Three Little Pups&quot; (1953), &quot;Blackboard Jumble&quot; (1957), and &quot;Sheep Wrecked&quot; (1958) – feature a slow-moving southern wolf character. Voiced by Daws Butler in a dialect Butler later used for Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s Huckleberry Hound, this wolf was a more deadpan character with a tendency to whistle &quot;Kingdom Coming&quot; (aka &quot;Jubalio&quot;) to himself (much like Huckleberry would sing &quot;Oh My Darling Clementine&quot; to himself).
Avery took a year-long break from MGM from 1950 to 1951, during which time Dick Lundy took over his unit to do one Droopy cartoon, &quot;Caballero Droopy&quot;, and several &quot;Barney Bear&quot; cartoons. Avery returned in late 1951 and continued with Droopy and his one-shots until the Avery unit was dissolved by MGM in 1953. Michael Lah, an Avery animator, stayed on long enough to help William Hanna and Joseph Barbera complete &quot;Deputy Droopy&quot; after Avery had left the studio. Lah himself then left MGM, but returned in 1955 to direct CinemaScope Droopy cartoons costarring either Spike (now called Butch because of the same-named bulldog in Hanna and Barbera&#x27;s Tom and Jerry cartoons) or the &quot;Kingdom Coming&quot;-whistling wolf. The opening title card was replaced with a newly drawn sequence in which Droopy gives his deadpan greeting: &quot;Hello, all you happy people.&quot; Seven Droopy cartoons were created under the H-B production stable. One of these, &quot;One Droopy Knight&quot; (1957), was nominated for the 1957 Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons). However, by the time of &quot;One Droopy Knight&quot;&#x27;s release in December 1957, the MGM cartoon studio had been closed for six months, a casualty of corporate downsizing.

===Later appearances===
In 1980, Filmation produced a series of lower-budget Droopy shorts for television as part of its &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; TV series &quot;The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show&quot;. In the 1990s Hanna-Barbera series &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry Kids&quot;, Droopy had a young son named Dripple (voiced by Charlie Adler), an older version of the infant we see in &quot;Homesteader Droopy&quot;. The mild success of the show provided perhaps the most Droopy merchandise: plush toys, gummy snacks, figurines, etc. In 1993, &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry Kids&quot; had a spin-off series, &quot;Droopy, Master Detective&quot;, which cast Droopy and son as film noir style detectives. Droopy also had cameos in two theatrical features: as an elevator operator in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (where he was voiced by the film&#x27;s animation director Richard Williams), and in &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Movie&quot;. Droopy also had cameos in all three subsequent Disney-produced Roger Rabbit shorts, &quot;Tummy Trouble&quot; (again he&#x27;s an elevator operator), &quot;Roller Coaster Rabbit&quot; (he plays a bad guy dressed as Snidely Whiplash), and &quot;Trail Mix-Up&quot; (he plays a scuba diver). Droopy also appears in the 2006 cartoon series &quot;Tom and Jerry Tales&quot;, and has appeared in almost every &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; direct-to-video movie, beginning with &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring&quot;, either as an ally or an enemy.

On October 1, 1992, back when Cartoon Network first aired, Droopy was given a very important role on showing the kids the guide of this channel in his lesser known program &quot;Droopy&#x27;s Guide to the Cartoon Network.

In June 1999, Droopy appeared in a Cartoon Network short entitled &quot;Thanks a Latté&quot;, in which he works at a coffee shop and forces a stingy wolf into giving him a tip. In said short, the character is depicted with a bald head and was voiced by Jeff Bergman. The short aired on Cartoon Network&#x27;s sister channel Boomerang until 2015. During the same period, Droopy was also featured in Adult Swim&#x27;s &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; in the episode &quot;Droopy Botox&quot;, voiced by Maurice LaMarche. He is seen seeking a settlement after a cosmetic surgeon injected him with too much botox (a running gag in this episode was the fact that Droopy was often seen crying despite having a huge grin frozen on his face, a reverse of the classic cartoons where a sad-faced Droopy often said, &quot;You know what? I&#x27;m happy&quot;). A memorable Cartoon Network promotional spot featured Droopy (voiced by Don Messick) and Shaggy from Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; parodying a dialog scene between Jules and Vincent in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.

A three-issue Droopy comic book miniseries was released in the mid-1990s by Dark Horse Comics.

In 1997, Droopy appeared in Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Bloopers of the Cartoon Stars&quot; bumper. Here in his blooper reel, he says his signature line &quot;I&#x27;m so happy&quot; while actually smiling.

==Filmography==
The Droopy cartoons were directed by Tex Avery (1943–1955), Dick Lundy (1952), Michael Lah (1955–1958) and William Hanna and Joseph Barbera (1956), at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio in Hollywood, California. All cartoons were released to theaters by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Fred Quimby was the producer of the first 17 cartoons from 1943 to 1955. Quimby retired in 1955 and from 1956 to 1958, Hanna and Barbera produced the cartoons until MGM closed the cartoon studio in 1957, and the last cartoon was released in 1958. Most of these cartoons were produced in the standard Academy ratio (1.37:1); seven cartoons were produced in widescreen CinemaScope format only.

Like any other studio, MGM reissued and edited its cartoons when re-released to theaters. Many pre-1951 cartoons were reissued with Perspecta Sound, which was introduced in 1954. MGM also reissued its cartoons before the introduction of Perspecta Sound. Because of the 1965 MGM vault fire, only backup prints of pre-1951 MGM cartoons exist.

<doc id="736222" wikidata="Q372299" url="?curid=736222" title="Billy Madison">
<text>Billy Madison is a 1995 American comedy film directed by Tamra Davis. It stars Adam Sandler in the title role, Bradley Whitford, Bridgette Wilson, Norm Macdonald, Darren McGavin, Mark Beltzman, and Larry Hankin. The film was written by Sandler and Tim Herlihy and produced by Robert Simonds, and was Macdonald&#x27;s feature film debut. It made around $26.4 million worldwide and debuted at number one at the box office.

Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics at the time of its release, the film is now considered one of Sandler&#x27;s best and has garnered a cult following over the years.

==Plot==
Billy Madison is the dimwitted, childish, and spoiled 27-year-old heir to Madison Hotels, a Fortune 500 chain of 650 hotels founded by his father, retiring tycoon Brian Madison. Refusing to study or learn the business as his father wants, Billy spends his days hanging out with his friends, drinking to excess, and causing all manner of disturbances across his family&#x27;s estate.

One evening, Billy ruins an important dinner meeting between Brian and his associates by acting obnoxiously. Brian, fed up, declares that his devious executive vice president Eric Gordon will inherit control of Madison Hotels and by extension the Madison family fortune. When Billy begs Brian to reconsider his decision, as he knows Eric hates him, Brian reveals that he secretly bribed Billy&#x27;s schoolteachers to give him passing grades. The two finally compromise: Billy must complete all 12 school grades, with 2 weeks for each grade, to prove he is competent enough to manage the company.

Shortly after enrolling in elementary school, Billy becomes attracted to a 3rd-grade teacher named Veronica Vaughn, who initially ignores him. Nevertheless, Billy successfully progresses through his first 2 grades. He finds himself as one of Veronica&#x27;s students in 3rd grade and earns her respect by standing up for Ernie, his friend and classmate. Billy becomes popular among the 3rd graders and misses them as he advances through school. Billy&#x27;s progress alarms Eric. Desperate to take over Madison Hotels, he blackmails Billy&#x27;s elementary school principal, Max Anderson, into lying that Billy bribed him for passing grades with magazine pictures of Max&#x27;s previous career as the &quot;Revolting Blob&quot;, a masked professional wrestler who accidentally killed a man in the ring.

Angered, Brian calls off his deal with Billy and renames Eric as chairman of the company. Billy grows distraught and reverts to his previous carefree lifestyle. Veronica motivates him to return to school, while his grade school classmates convince Max to retract his false accusations, infuriating Eric. Brian agrees to give Billy another chance, but Eric retorts that Billy failed the challenge by not finishing 9th grade within 2 weeks and threatens to sue Brian for breach of contract. Billy intervenes and challenges Eric to an academic decathlon to finally settle their feud, with the winner getting to take over Madison Hotels.

Both men excel in different activities, but Billy manages to take a single-point lead before the contest&#x27;s final event, a &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;-style academic test. Billy gives a completely dimwitted answer for the opening question in the event, but when asked to pick the next category for Eric, chooses business ethics. Eric, being a highly unscrupulous businessman, cannot conceive of an answer and has a nervous breakdown. He aims at Billy with a revolver, but Max (in his wrestling gear) surprises and overpowers him. Eric then tries to kill Veronica with his loose arm before getting shot in the buttock by Danny McGrath, a rifle-wielding madman whom Billy apologized to earlier for bullying him years ago.

At his graduation ceremony, Billy, realizing that he is not mature enough to replace his father, announces he will pass ownership of Madison Hotels to Carl Alphonse, Brian&#x27;s more polite and loyal operations manager, before stating his intention to get a teaching certificate. Eric, recently fired by Brian and now walking on crutches due to his wound, can only watch in frustration.

==Production==
Filming took place from June 26 to August 29, 1994, in and around Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Adam Sandler convinced Universal Pictures to hire Stephen Kessler to direct the film; however, after three days of filming, Universal was unhappy with the footage and had replaced him with Tamra Davis, who was Universal&#x27;s initial top choice to direct. The Madison&#x27;s Mansion exterior and grounds were shot at the Parkwood Estate in Oshawa while the interior was filmed in Casa Loma in Toronto. The entrance to the mansion was filmed at Marylake Augustinian Monastery in King City.

While on &quot;Norm Macdonald Live&quot;, Sandler revealed that the role of Jack was intended for Allen Covert. Sandler wanted Bob Odenkirk, a former &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; colleague, for the role of Eric Gordon, but the studio rejected it as Odenkirk was not considered a serious actor. Sandler then suggested Philip Seymour Hoffman for the role; Hoffman auditioned and later turned it down, resulting in Bradley Whitford&#x27;s casting. For his scene as the frantic and overstrung bus driver, Farley drank six shots of espresso before filming.

The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Audiences who enjoy Adam Sandler&#x27;s belligerent comic energy may find him in joyously obnoxious form as &quot;Billy Madison&quot;, but this thinly-plotted starring vehicle surrounds its star with an aggressively pedestrian movie.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 16 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;.

Richard Schickel panned the film, calling it &quot;one of the most execrable movies ever made&quot;. Peter Rainer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; commented; &quot;Sandler has a bad habit of thinking he is funnier than we are&quot;. On &quot;At the Movies&quot;, Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert both gave the film thumbs down, and Roger Ebert said of Sandler, &quot;... Not an attractive screen presence. He might have a career as a villain or as a fall guy or the butt of a joke, but as the protagonist his problem is that he recreates the fingernails on the blackboard syndrome.&quot; Gene Siskel added &quot;... you don&#x27;t have a good motivation for the character&#x27;s behavior&quot;. Owen Gleiberman also panned the film, saying &quot;By the end, you feel like a drill sergeant — you want to wipe that stupid grin off Sandler&#x27;s face&quot;. Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said the film was trying to be &quot;A more kid-friendly version of ″&quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;.&#x27; And there&#x27;s even a moral: &#x27;Yahoo for education,&#x27; though the movie doesn&#x27;t really put any muscle behind it.&quot;

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a mixed review, saying &quot;It succeeds as a reasonably smart no-brainer. If you&#x27;ve ever had a yearning to relive the third grade, this must be the next best thing.&quot; Brian Lowry of &quot;Variety&quot; also gave the film a mixed review, saying &quot;There are a few bursts of sheer, irresistible idiocy — along the lines of ″&quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;″ or even ″&quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;″ — but not enough to sustain the more arid stretches.&quot;

Billy Mowbray of Film4 gave the film a positive review, writing: &quot;When you get that Sandler&#x27;s comedic persona is meant to be annoying, like Beavis and Butt-Head or Cartman, the laughs come thick and fast&quot;. Kevin N. Laforest said, &quot;Okay, the plot is inane, but it&#x27;s the basis of a series of really funny scenes.&quot;

<text>Dubravka Ugrešić (; 27 March 1949 – 17 March 2023) was a Yugoslav-Croatian and Dutch writer. A graduate of University of Zagreb, she was based in Amsterdam from 1996 and continued to identify as a Yugoslav writer.

==Early life and education==
Ugrešić was born on 27 March 1949 in Kutina, Yugoslavia (now Croatia). She was born into an ethnically mixed family; her mother was an ethnic Bulgarian from Varna. She majored in comparative literature and Russian language at the University of Zagreb&#x27;s Faculty of Arts, pursuing parallel careers as a scholar and as a writer. After graduation, she continued to work at the university, at the Institute for Theory of Literature. In 1993, she left Croatia for political reasons. She spent time teaching at European and American universities, including UNC-Chapel Hill, UCLA, Harvard University, Wesleyan University, and Columbia University. She was based in Amsterdam where she was a freelance writer and contributor to several American and European literary magazines and newspapers.

== Writing ==

===Novels and short stories===

Dubravka Ugrešić published novels and short story collections. Her novella &quot;Steffie Speck in the Jaws of Life&quot; () was published in 1981. Filled with references to works of both high literature (by authors such as Gustave Flaubert and Bohumil Hrabal) and trivial genres (such as romance novels and chick lit), it represents a sophisticated and lighthearted postmodern play with the traditional concept of the novel. It follows a young typist named Steffie Speck, whose name was taken from a Dear Abby column, as she searches for love, both parodying and being compelled by the kitschy elements of romance. The novel was made into a successful 1984 Yugoslav film &quot;In the Jaws of Life&quot;, directed by Rajko Grlić.

Regarding her writing, Ugrešić remarked:

Her novel &quot;Fording the Stream of Consciousness&quot; received the NIN Award in 1988, the highest literary honor in former Yugoslavia, whose winners include Danilo Kiš and Milorad Pavić; Ugrešić was the first woman to be awarded the prize. The novel is Bulgakov-like &quot;thriller&quot; about an international &quot;family of writers&quot; who gather at a conference in Zagreb during Yugoslavian times. &quot;Museum of Unconditional Surrender&quot; is a novel about the melancholy of remembrance and forgetting. A female narrator, an exile, surrounded by scenery of post-Wall Berlin and images of her war-torn country Yugoslavia, constantly changes the time zones of her life, past and present.

Set in Amsterdam, &quot;Ministry of Pain&quot; portrays the lives of displaced people. In the novel &quot;Baba Yaga Laid An Egg&quot;, published in the Canongate Myth Series. Ugrešić drew on the Slavic mythological figure of Baba Yaga to tell a modern fairy tale. It concerns societal gender inequalities and discrimination.

===Essays===

Ugrešić’s “creative work resists reduction to simplified, isolated interpretative models”.

Her collection &quot;Have A Nice Day: From the Balkan War to the American Dream&quot; () consists of short dictionary-like essays on American everyday existence, seen through the lenses of a visitor whose country is falling apart. &quot;The Culture of Lies&quot; is a volume of essays on ordinary lives in a time of war, nationalism and collective paranoia. &quot;Her writing attacks the savage stupidities of war, punctures the macho heroism that surrounds it, and plumbs the depths of the pain and pathos of exile&quot; according to Richard Byrne of Common Review. &quot;Thank You For Not Reading&quot; is a collection of essays on literary trivia: the publishing industry, literature, culture and the place of writing.

Ugrešić received several major awards for her essays, including Charles Veillon Prize, Heinrich Mann Prize, Jean Amery Prize. In the United States, &quot;Karaoke Culture&quot; was shortlisted for National Book Critic Circle Award.

===Other writings===

Dubravka Ugrešić was also a literary scholar who published articles on Russian avant-garde literature, and a scholarly book on Russian contemporary fiction &quot;Nova ruska proza&quot; (&quot;New Russian Fiction&quot;, 1980). She edited anthologies, such as &quot;Pljuska u ruci&quot; (&quot;A Slap in the Hand&quot;), co-edited nine volumes of &quot;Pojmovnik ruske avangarde&quot; (&quot;Glossary of Russian avant-garde&quot;), and translated writers such as Boris Pilnyak and Daniil Kharms (from Russian into Croatian). She was also the author of three books for children.

== Politics and exile ==

At the outbreak of the war in 1991 in former Yugoslavia, Ugrešić took a firm anti-war and anti-nationalist stand. She wrote critically about nationalism, the stupidity and the criminality of war, and soon became a target of parts of the Croatian media, fellow writers and public figures. She had been accused of anti-patriotism and proclaimed a &quot;traitor&quot;, a &quot;public enemy&quot; and a &quot;witch&quot;. She left Croatia in 1993 after a long-lasting series of public attacks, and because she “could not adapt to the permanent terror of lies in public, political, cultural, and everyday life”. She wrote about her experience of collective nationalist hysteria in her book &quot;The Culture of Lies&quot;, and described her &quot;personal case&quot; in the essay &quot;The Question of Perspective&quot; (&quot;Karaoke Culture&quot;). She continued to write about the dark sides of modern societies, about the &quot;homogenization&quot; of people induced by media, politics, religion, common beliefs and the marketplace (&quot;Europe in Sepia&quot;). Being &quot;the citizen of a ruin&quot; she was interested in the complexity of a &quot;condition called exile&quot; (J. Brodsky). Her novels (&quot;Ministry of Pain&quot;, &quot;The Museum of Unconditional Surrender&quot;) explore exile traumas, but also the excitement of exile freedom. Her essay &quot;Writer in Exile&quot; (in &quot;Thank You for Not Reading&quot;) is a small writer&#x27;s guide to exile. She described herself as &quot;post-Yugoslav, transnational, or, even more precisely, postnational&quot;.

In 2017, she signed the Declaration on the Common Language of the Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks and Montenegrins.

<doc id="736224" wikidata="Q5045440" url="?curid=736224" title="Carolyn Parrish">
<text>Carolyn Parrish (born Karolina Janozeski; October 3, 1946) is a Canadian politician who has been the 7th and current mayor of Mississauga since June 24, 2024. Parrish previously served as a member of Parliament (MP), representing ridings in Mississauga from 1993 to 2006. She sat as a Liberal until 2004. She was a Mississauga city councillor from 2006 to 2010 and later from 2014 to 2024 when she resigned to contest the 2024 by-election for mayor.

== Background ==
Parrish was born as Karolina Janozeski and is of Polish heritage. Her sister is romance novelist Marsha Canham. Parrish studied at the University of Toronto, St. Michael&#x27;s College, graduating in 1969, and became a high school teacher. She served as a Trustee on the Peel Board of Education from 1985 to 1990, and was chairperson from 1988 to 1990. She was first elected to the House of Commons as a Liberal in the 1993 election and was re-elected in the three subsequent general elections of 1997, 2000 and 2004. She ended her federal career representing the Mississauga, Ontario riding of Mississauga—Erindale as an independent Member of Parliament.

== Federal politics ==

=== Criticism of U.S. President George W. Bush ===

Never promoted from the parliamentary backbench, Parrish was largely unknown nationally until the eve of the U.S.-led Invasion of Iraq in 2003. On her way out of a meeting on February 26, 2003, in a media scrum Parrish was overheard on a boom mike saying, &quot;Damn Americans, I hate those bastards!&quot; She later told the media that her comments were directed towards George W. Bush and his administration and not the American people as a whole. Members of the opposition Canadian Alliance party called for her to be punished by then Liberal leader and Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, but no disciplinary action occurred.

After the widespread media attention on her &quot;America-bashing&quot; incident, she remained popular in her home riding. After electoral redistribution leading up to the 2004 election, she faced fellow Liberal MP Steve Mahoney in a nomination battle and narrowly won. She was re-elected with 54% of the vote in the general election, against 32% for her Conservative opponent.

In August 2004, Parrish again created controversy by referring to those supporting the North American missile defence proposal as &quot;a coalition of the idiots,&quot; mocking the phrase &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; used by Bush describing the American-led alliance in the invasion of Iraq. Paul Martin, who had succeeded Chrétien as Prime Minister, asked her to use more tact and discretion when sharing her opinions about such subjects but stopped short of asking her to apologize. She responded by saying, &quot;I was elected by thousands of people in my riding. They have known me for years. I think they like my style.&quot;

Following the November U.S. election, she expressed shock at the re-election of George W. Bush. She said that &quot;America is completely out of touch with the rest of the free world&quot; and blamed this on collective &quot;profound psychological damage&quot; due to the September 11, 2001 attacks. She was also quoted as saying, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t guess what&#x27;s next on his agenda, but it&#x27;s probably not peace and love.&quot; When Conservative Party members called on her to apologize for these remarks she said that such comments &quot;are in the best traditions of free speech and independence of thought.&quot; These comments came just hours after Paul Martin warned his MPs in a private caucus meeting not to make incendiary comments in the wake of the U.S. election. Parrish explained that she wasn&#x27;t at the meeting, but that even if she had been, it wouldn&#x27;t have stopped her from speaking her mind.

In October 2004, at the annual Parliamentary Press Gallery dinner in Ottawa, Martin joked about meeting with Bush and discussing the possibility of a crewed mission to Mars. &quot;I thought to myself, wouldn&#x27;t it be great if we could get a Canadian on board? If a Canadian could be sent tens of millions of miles into the dark void of space. And as we all as a nation watch on television and together say aloud, `Bon voyage, Carolyn Parrish!&#x27;&quot;

=== &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; incident and departure from caucus ===

On November 17, 2004, clips of a skit for the CBC Television comedy series &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; were released, in which she stomped on a Bush doll and stuck a pin in its head, where she said &quot;it would do the least damage.&quot; The full version was to air on November 19. The sketch caused outrage from Conservative members and prompted Martin to ask for a meeting with her.

On November 18, a Canadian Press story quoted her as saying Martin, and those around him, could &quot;go to hell&quot; if they wanted her to stop making similar comments. She went on to say that she had no loyalty towards the Liberal Party and that if it were defeated in the next election, she &quot;would not shed a tear,&quot; as she had felt betrayed by Martin&#x27;s lack of help for her during her nomination and election campaigns. In response to these comments, Martin, with the support of National Liberal Caucus chair Andy Savoy, expelled her from caucus, saying, &quot;I told her that, while I have defended her right to express her views frankly, I cannot, as leader of our party and the government caucus, tolerate behaviour that demeans and disrespects others.&quot;

On November 19, Parrish spoke to the press about her expulsion from caucus. She said that had she been in Martin&#x27;s place, she would have done the same. She went on to say, however, that the party under Martin had fallen into disarray and that Martin and his inner circle ran the party using guerrilla warfare tactics. She said she would still vote with the Liberals on the vast majority of legislation, but would now be free to express her views without fear of reprisal.

Though excluded from caucus, Parrish initially still sat as a Liberal in the House of Commons but became an independent on November 21 so that the speaker would give her time in member&#x27;s statements and question period without the notice of the Liberal whip.

On November 30, 2004, Parrish appeared on CNN in an interview with Wolf Blitzer and Tucker Carlson, defending her position against Bush and her recent actions that led to ousting from the Liberal party. She also defended the overall Canadian stance regarding the Iraq War and the National Missile Defence program. Several days later Martin appeared on &quot;Late Edition,&quot; with Blitzer hosting. Blitzer talked about several MPs attacking Bush and Martin replied that only Parrish had made attacks and that they had been condemned throughout Parliament.

=== Independent MP and retirement from federal politics ===

Parrish announced in December 2004 that she would oppose the Martin government&#x27;s proposed legislation to legally establish same-sex marriage in Canada. A surprise to the Prime Minister, Parrish claimed that, although she personally supports same-sex marriage, her constituents were generally opposed to it.

On May 19, 2005, Paul Martin&#x27;s Liberal government faced two votes of confidence on its 2005-06 budget legislation. In the days leading up to the vote, Parrish said that she would support the government despite her difficulties with Martin&#x27;s administration. Her support was critical to the government&#x27;s survival, given the even division in the house. On the morning of the vote, Parrish informed a media representative that she was suffering from severe pain due to a medical ailment. She attended the vote, which the government won by one vote.

In July 2005, Parrish chastised Chief of Defence Staff General Rick Hillier as being &quot;dangerous&quot; and a &quot;testosterone-filled general&quot; after he made comments stating that a soldier&#x27;s purpose was &quot;to be able to kill people&quot; such as terrorists whom he described as &quot;murderers and scumbags.&quot;

Although Parrish indicated that she was considering returning to the Liberal Caucus and remains to date a card-carrying member of the Liberal Party, an aide to the Prime Minister stated on July 29, 2005, that &quot;he&#x27;s not even entertaining the thought of welcoming Carolyn Parrish back to caucus.&quot; Parrish was the only one of four Independent MPs in the House to vote with the government against the successful November 28, 2005 motion of non-confidence that brought down the Liberal government.

On October 13, 2005, Parrish&#x27;s spokeswoman announced that the MP had sent a letter to her constituents stating that she would not stand for re-election. She publicly supported the Liberal candidate, Omar Alghabra, ahead of the 2006 election.

==Municipal politics==
===Mississauga City Councillor===

In the 2006 municipal election, Parrish was elected to Ward 6 by 1,400 votes. In 2009, she raised concerns on council regarding the possible conflict of interest of then-mayor of Mississauga, Hazel McCallion&#x27;s son&#x27;s company in a failed land deal involving the council, and McCallion herself in promoting it. In particular, she claimed that he personally stood to gain $10 million. An inquiry led by Douglas Cunningham was ultimately called to investigate the allegations. However, at the 2010 municipal election, Parrish lost to McCallion ally Ron Starr by 1,889 votes. She subsequently announced her retirement from political life, although has left the way open for re-entering at some point. She contested a by-election in neighbouring Ward 5 on September 19, 2011, losing to Bonnie Crombie by 241 votes. Shortly after the election, Cunningham&#x27;s report was released, including a finding that McCallion had a &quot;conflict of interest, both real and apparent&quot; in the land deal. Parrish told media that she felt the election result would have been different had this been known.

Parrish was the councillor for Ward 5 in Mississauga City Council, after winning the seat in the 2014 municipal election. She has stated that she believes non-citizen permanent residents should have the right to sit on municipal committees, though not on the city council itself.

On February 20, 2024, Parrish sent a letter to the Mississauga ward 5 constituents informing them that she would be resigning her councillor&#x27;s seat effective March 15, 2024, in order to run for the mayor&#x27;s seat in a citywide by-election to be held June 10, 2024, to replace former mayor Bonnie Crombie. She was elected as the 7th mayor of Mississauga and was succeeded as councillor by Natalie Hart.

===Mayor of Mississauga===
Parrish was sworn in as the 7th mayor of Mississauga on June 24, 2024. The ceremony took place at the Living Arts Centre at 7 p.m. EST. She appointed Ward 8 Erin Mills councillor Matt Mahoney as deputy mayor the same month.

In November 2024, Parrish resigned from the Peel Police Services Board to protest the board&#x27;s planned $136 million (approximately 21%) budget increase for the Peel Regional Police when residents&#x27; cost of living was an issue. Traditionally, the mayor of Mississauga has a seat on the board.

====Sinwar vigil controversy====

In November 2024, Parrish faced criticism for her response to a planned vigil honoring Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar at Mississauga&#x27;s Celebration Square. When questioned about the event at a city council meeting, Parrish compared Sinwar to Nelson Mandela, stating &quot;Nelson Mandela was declared a terrorist by the United States of America &#x27;til the year 2008. Your terrorist and somebody else&#x27;s terrorist may be two different things&quot;.

The vigil was organized by Canadian Defenders 4 Human Rights (CD4HR) and was initially scheduled for November 26, 2024. Parrish initially defended the event&#x27;s right to proceed under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, despite Hamas being designated as a terrorist entity by Canada since 2002. The event drew additional controversy for using the Royal Canadian Legion&#x27;s trademarked poppy symbol and &quot;Lest We Forget&quot; slogan in its promotional materials.

Multiple Jewish organizations, including the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA) and B&#x27;nai Brith Canada, condemned Parrish&#x27;s statements and called for an apology. Canada&#x27;s special envoy combatting antisemitism, Deborah Lyons, called the idea of a commemoration for Sinwar on Canadian soil &quot;atrocious&quot;.

The organizers eventually cancelled the vigil, citing security concerns, though they indicated they had been assured by the City of Mississauga that they could hold the event on another date. Jewish community leaders continued to call for an apology from Parrish for her comments comparing Sinwar to Mandela.

<text>Nelson Richard DeMille (August 23, 1943 – September 17, 2024) was an American author of action adventure and suspense novels. His novels include &quot;Plum Island&quot;, &quot;The Charm School&quot;, and &quot;The General&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. DeMille also wrote under the pen names Jack Cannon, Kurt Ladner, Ellen Kay, and Brad Matthews.

== Biography ==
DeMille was born in New York City on August 23, 1943 to Huron (1916-1992) and Antonia aka Molly (1919-1999). Huron was born in Hagersville, Ontario Canada and immigrated to the United States on or about 1935. Nelson was predeceaced by his three brothers; Clark (1950-1980), Dennis (1947-2018) and Lance (1957-2022). He moved as a child with his family to Elmont,Long Island where he and his brothers were raised. He attended Elmont Memorial High School where he played football and ran track. There is a street in Elmont, DEMILLE AVENUE named after his father who was a builder who helped develop Elmont in its early years. 

After spending three years at Hofstra University, he joined the Army and attended Officer Candidate School. He was a first lieutenant in the United States Army (1966–1969) and saw action as an infantry platoon leader with the First Cavalry Division in Vietnam. He was decorated with the Air Medal, Bronze Star, and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, and was awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge.

DeMille returned to the States and went back to Hofstra University, where he received his degree in political science and history. He had three children, Lauren, Alexander, and James. He lived in Garden City, New York.

DeMille&#x27;s earlier books were New York City Police Department (NYPD) detective novels. His first major novel was &quot;By the Rivers of Babylon&quot;, published in 1978 and still in print, as are all his succeeding novels. He was a member of American Mensa and the Authors Guild, and president of the Mystery Writers of America. He was also a member of the International Thriller Writers, who honored him as 2015 ThrillerMaster of the Year. DeMille held three honorary doctorates: Doctor of Humane Letters from Hofstra University, Doctor of Literature from Long Island University, and Doctor of Humane Letters from Dowling College.

DeMille is the author of &quot;By the Rivers of Babylon&quot;, &quot;Cathedral&quot;, &quot;The Talbot Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Word of Honor&quot;, &quot;The Charm School&quot;, &quot;The Gold Coast&quot;, &quot;The General&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, &quot;Spencerville&quot;, &quot;Plum Island&quot;, &quot;The Lion’s Game&quot;, &quot;Up Country&quot;, &quot;Night Fall&quot;, &quot;Wild Fire&quot;, &quot;The Gate House&quot;, &quot;The Lion&quot;, &quot;The Panther&quot;, &quot; The Quest&quot;, &quot;Radiant Angel&quot;, and &quot;The Cuban Affair&quot;. He also co-authored &quot;Mayday&quot; with Thomas Block and &quot;The Deserter&quot; and &quot;Blood Lines&quot; with his son, Alex DeMille, and has contributed short stories, book reviews, and articles to magazines and newspapers both online and in print.

DeMille died of esophageal cancer at NYU Langone Hospital – Long Island, on September 17, 2024, at the age of 81.

== Writing style ==
Many of DeMille&#x27;s books are written in the first person, and as such his books follow a linear plotline in which the reader moves along with the main character.

Although the tone of his writing varies from novel to novel, one consistent tool is DeMille&#x27;s liberal use of sarcasm and dry humor.

Most DeMille novels, especially the more recent, avoid &quot;Hollywood endings,&quot; and instead finish either inconclusively or with the hero successfully exposing the secret/solving the mystery while suffering in his career or personal life as a result. There are generally loose ends left for the reader to puzzle over, such as in &quot;Night Fall&quot;.

== Works ==
DeMille&#x27;s home Long Island is a setting in many parts of his novels, as in &quot;The Gold Coast&quot;, &quot;The Gate House&quot;, &quot;Plum Island&quot;, &quot;Word of Honor&quot;, &quot;Night Fall&quot;, and &quot;Radiant Angel&quot;. His most recent novels have followed two main characters, John Corey (starring in seven novels) and Paul Brenner (starring in two novels, with also a part in Corey&#x27;s sixth novel). In earlier works, the storylines were completely separate, but there have been hints in the novels that they are part of a larger &quot;DeMille Universe&quot; that references events and characters in earlier novels, such as &quot;The Gold Coast&quot; and &quot;The Charm School&quot;.

DeMille spent approximately 16 months creating each of his novels due to the extensive research involved, and because he wrote them longhand on legal pads with a number one pencil.

<text>Nancy Lancaster (10 September 1897 – 19 August 1994) was a 20th-century tastemaker and the owner of Colefax &amp; Fowler, an influential British decorating firm that codified what is known as the English country house look.

==Biography==
She was born Nancy Keene Perkins as the elder daughter of Thomas Moncure Perkins, a Virginia cotton broker, and his wife Elizabeth Langhorne, a daughter of Chiswell Langhorne. Her birthplace was Mirador, the estate farm of her maternal grandfather, in Greenwood, near Charlottesville, Virginia. She was brought up in Richmond, Virginia and New York City. Nancy Lancaster had four maternal aunts, of whom the most notable were Nancy, Lady Astor, a British politician, and Irene Gibson, wife of artist Charles Dana Gibson, who popularized the Gibson Girl. Her cousin Joyce Grenfell was a celebrated British monologuist and actress. Nancy was graduated from Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Virginia in 1915, which was founded by her distant cousin, Charlotte Haxall Noland.

==Personal life==
===First marriage===
Nancy was first married, on February 7, 1917, to Henry Field, a grandson of Marshall Field, the wealthy founder of the Chicago department store. He died five months later -- on July 8, 1917 -- at age 22 at Presbyterian Hospital in New York City following an operation.

===Second marriage===
In 1920 Nancy married journalist and investor Ronald Tree (1897–1976), a cousin of her first husband. After moving to England in 1927, they had two sons, Michael Lambert Tree (1921-1999) and Jeremy Tree (1925-1993), and a daughter, Rosemary, who died at birth in 1922. Michael married Lady Anne Cavendish, a daughter of Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire.

At first the Trees took a 10-year repairing lease on Kelmarsh Hall near Market Harborough in Northamptonshire, which Nancy redecorated with help from Mrs Guy Bethell of Elden Ltd. In 1933, the Trees bought Ditchley Park near Charlbury in Oxfordshire, and it was the decoration of this house which earned Nancy the reputation of having &quot;the best taste of almost anyone in the world.&quot; She worked on it with Sibyl Colefax (Mrs Bethell having died) and the French decorator Stéphane Boudin of the Paris firm Jansen.

In November 1933, Ronald Tree became the Conservative Party member of Parliament for Harborough. Tree was among a small group who saw the rising Nazi party in Germany as a threat to Britain, and he became a member of a clique of anti-appeasement MPs (who included Eden, Duff Cooper and others) who would meet at his house in Queen Anne&#x27;s Gate. Winston Churchill was not part of this group, but he and his wife Clementine dined at Ditchley on numerous occasions from 1937.

On the outbreak of war, the authorities were concerned by the vulnerability to enemy air attack of both Churchill&#x27;s country house Chartwell and the Prime Minister&#x27;s retreat of Chequers especially, as Churchill romantically termed it &#x27;When the Moon is High&#x27;. Churchill had use of the Paddock bunker in Neasden, but only used it on one occasion for a cabinet meeting, before returning to his Cabinet War Room bunker in Whitehall. However, this created additional difficulties on clear nights when a full moon was predicted - so the authorities looked for an alternative site north of London. Tree offered Churchill use of Ditchley which, thanks to its tree coverage and lack of visible access road made it an ideal site Churchill was happy with. Churchill first went to Ditchley in lieu of Chequers on 9 November 1940, accompanied by Clementine and his daughter Mary. By late 1942, America had entered the war and the security at Chequers had improved, including covering the road with turf. The last weekend Churchill attended Ditchley as his official residence was Tree&#x27;s birthday on 26 September 1942. Churchill&#x27;s last visit was for lunch in 1943.

Churchill gave Tree a job in the Ministry of Information, where he met American co-worker Marietta Peabody FitzGerald. The two began an affair. After Tree lost his seat in the 1945 election, Tree and Peabody divorced their respective partners and married on 26 July 1947. In 1949, their only child was born, the 1960s supermodel Penelope Tree.

===Third marriage===

Nancy married, thirdly, in 1948, Lieutenant Colonel Claude Lancaster (1899–1977), a former military officer, country squire and member of Parliament who owned Kelmarsh Hall near Market Harborough, Northamptonshire. Renowned today for its gardens, it is a popular tourist site and said to be Nancy Lancaster&#x27;s favorite home of all, despite their divorce after only five years in 1953. The couple had been having an affair for years prior to their marriage. Nancy Lancaster later claimed that it was the suffocating, day-to-day intimacy of marriage that made her realise why they were successful as lovers and ill-suited as husband and wife.

In 1950, Nancy was forced to sell her beloved Mirador and in 1954 she bought Haseley Court near Oxford. She renovated and decorated the house with the help of her business partner, John Fowler (1906–1977). They also created the famous Yellow Room at Avery Row, Mayfair. After a fire in 1971, she sold the main house at Haseley and moved into the coach house, where she lived for the rest of her life. The garden she created at Haseley was particularly famous for its sense of style. The renowned British interior designer David Hicks (1929–1998) called Nancy Lancaster &quot;the most influential English gardener since Gertrude Jekyll.&quot; Referred to as the doyenne of interior decorators (something she never was, nor ever claimed to be) and smart gardeners, she together with John Fowler created much of the English country house look.

==Death==
Nancy Lancaster died in 1994 and is buried in Virginia, between her first husband and the infant daughter from her second marriage.

<text>Google AdSense is a program run by Google through which website publishers in the Google Network of content sites serve text, images, video, or interactive media advertisements that are targeted to the site content and audience. These advertisements are administered, sorted, and maintained by Google. They can generate revenue on either a per-click or per-impression basis. Google beta-tested a cost-per-action service, but discontinued it in October 2008 in favor of a DoubleClick offering (also owned by Google). In Q1 2014, Google earned US$3.4 billion ($13.6 billion annualized), or 22% of total revenue, through Google AdSense. In 2021, more than 38 million websites used AdSense. It is a participant in the AdChoices program, so AdSense ads typically include the triangle-shaped AdChoices icon. This program also operates on HTTP cookies.

==Overview==
Google uses its technology to serve advertisements based on website content, the user&#x27;s geographical location, and other factors. Those wanting to advertise with Google&#x27;s targeted advertisement system may enroll through Google Ads. AdSense has become one of the most popular programs specializing in creating and placing banner and responsive ads on websites and blogs. Responsive ads adjust themselves based upon user&#x27;s device size. These advertisements are less intrusive and the content of the advertisements is often relevant to the website. Many websites use AdSense to make revenue from their web content (website, online videos, online audio content, etc.), and it is the most popular advertising network. AdSense has proved particularly useful for generating advertising revenue for small websites that do not have sufficient resources or other major sources of revenue. To display contextually relevant advertisements on a website, webmasters place a brief JavaScript code on the website&#x27;s pages. Websites that are content-rich have been very successful with this advertising program, as noted in a number of publisher case studies on the AdSense website. Google has removed the policy of limiting AdSense ads to three ads per page. Now, AdSense publishers can place several AdSense ads on a page given there is sufficient content on a webpage. According to Google guidelines on ensuring proper ad placement, advertising and promotional material should not exceed page content.

Some webmasters put significant effort into maximizing their AdSense income. They do this mainly by following best practices:
# They produce good quality content that attracts and engages users and provides a good user experience.
# They follow webmaster guidelines.
# They avoid flooding their website with advertisements.
# They do not try methods that encourage users to click ads. Google prohibits webmasters from using phrases like &quot;Click on my AdSense ads&quot; to increase click rates. The phrases accepted are &quot;Sponsored Links&quot; and &quot;Advertisements&quot;.
# They do not link or redirect to websites with a poor reputation.

The source of all AdSense income is the Ads program, which in turn has a complex pricing model based on a Vickrey second price auction. AdSense requires an advertiser to submit a sealed bid (i.e., a bid not observable by competitors). Additionally, for any given click received, advertisers only pay one bid increment above the second-highest bid. Google currently shares 68% of revenue generated by AdSense with content network partners, and 51% of revenue generated by AdSense with AdSense for Search partners. On June 18, 2015, Google announced rebranding of AdSense with a new logo.
==History==
Google launched its AdSense program, originally named &quot;Content targeting advertising&quot; in March 2003. The AdSense name was originally used by Applied Semantics, a competitive offering to AdSense. The name was adopted by Google after Google acquired Applied Semantics in April 2003. Some advertisers complained that AdSense yielded worse results than Google Ads, since it served ads that related contextually to the content on a web page and that content was less likely to be related to a user&#x27;s commercial desires than search results. For example, someone browsing a blog dedicated to flowers was less likely to be interested in ordering flowers than someone searching for terms related to flowers. As a result, in 2004 Google allowed its advertisers to opt-out of the AdSense network.

Paul Buchheit, the founder of Gmail, had the idea to run ads within Google&#x27;s e-mail service. But he and others say it was Susan Wojcicki, with the backing of Sergey Brin, who organized the team that adapted that idea into an enormously successful product. By early 2005 AdSense accounted for an estimated 15 percent of Google&#x27;s total revenues. In 2009, Google AdSense announced that it would now be offering new features, including the ability to &quot;enable multiple networks to display ads&quot;. In February 2010, Google AdSense started using search history in contextual matching to offer more relevant ads. On January 21, 2014, Google AdSense launched Direct Campaigns, a tool where publishers may directly sell ads. This feature was retired on February 10, 2015.

==Types==

===Content===
The content-based advertisements can be targeted at users with certain interests or contexts. The targeting can be CPC (cost per click) or CPM (cost per thousand impressions) based, the only significant difference in CPC and CPM is that with CPC targeting, earnings are based on clicks while CPM earnings recently are actually based not just per views/impression but on a larger scale, per thousand impressions, therefore driving it from the market, which makes CPC ads more common.

There are various ad sizes available for content ads. The ads can be simple text, image, animated image, flash video, video, or rich media ads. At most ad sizes, users can change whether to show both text and multimedia ads or just one of them. , a grey arrow appears beneath AdSense text ads for easier identification. Google made a policy update regarding the number of ads per page, the three ads per page limit has been removed.

===Search===
AdSense for search allows publishers to display ads relating to search terms on their site and receive 51% of the revenue generated from those ads. AdSense custom search ads can be displayed either alongside the results from an AdSense Custom Search Engine or alongside internal search results through the use of Custom Search Ads. Custom Search Ads are only available to &quot;white-listed&quot; publishers. Although the revenue share from AdSense for Search (51%) is lower than from AdSense for Content (68%) higher returns can be achieved due to the potential for higher Click Through Rates.

===Video===
AdSense for video allows publishers with video content (e.g., video hosting websites) to generate revenue using ad placements from Google&#x27;s extensive advertising network. The publisher is able to decide what type of ads are shown with their video inventory. Formats available include linear video ads (pre-roll or post-roll), overlay ads that display AdSense text and display ads over the video content, and the TrueView format. Publishers can also display companion ads - display ads that run alongside video content outside the player. AdSense for video is for publishers running video content within a player and not for YouTube publishers.

===Link units===
Link units are closely targeted to the interests of users. Because users directly interact with the ad unit, they may be more interested in the ads they eventually see.

AdSense publishers are paid for clicks on the ads that are linked from link unit topics, not for clicks on the initial topics themselves. The ads on the linked page are pay-per-click Google ads similar to those shown in regular AdSense ad units. Link Units

==Discontinued types==

===Mobile content===
AdSense for mobile content allowed publishers to generate earnings from their mobile websites using targeted Google advertisements. Just like AdSense for content, Google matches advertisements to the content of a website — in this case, a mobile website. Instead of traditional JavaScript code, technologies such as Java and Objective-C are used. As of February 2012, AdSense for Mobile Content was rolled into the core AdSense for Content offering to better reflect the lessening separation between desktop and mobile content.

===Domains===
AdSense for domains allows advertisements to be placed on domain names that have not been developed. This offers domain name owners a way to monetize (make money from) domain names that are otherwise dormant or not in use. AdSense for domains is currently being offered to all AdSense publishers, but it wasn&#x27;t always available to all. On December 12, 2008, &quot;TechCrunch&quot; reported that AdSense for Domains is available for all US publishers. On February 22, 2012, Google announced that it was shutting down its Hosted AdSense for Domains program.

===Feeds===
In May 2005, Google announced a limited-participation beta version of AdSense for Feeds, a version of AdSense that runs on RSS and Atom feeds that have more than 100 active subscribers. According to the Official Google Blog, &quot;advertisers have their ads placed in the most appropriate feed articles; publishers are paid for their original content; readers see relevant advertising—and in the long run, more quality feeds to choose from.&quot; AdSense for Feeds works by inserting images into a feed. When the image is displayed by a RSS reader or Web browser, Google writes the advertising content into the image that it returns. The advertisement content is chosen based on the content of the feed surrounding the image. When the user clicks the image, he or she is redirected to the advertiser&#x27;s website in the same way as regular AdSense advertisements. AdSense for Feeds remained in its beta state until August 15, 2008, when it became available to all AdSense users. On December 3, 2012, Google discontinued AdSense For Feeds program.

==How it works==
* The webmaster who wishes to participate in AdSense inserts the AdSense JavaScript code into a webpage.
* Each time this page is visited by an end user (e.g., a person surfing the Internet), the JavaScript code uses inlined JSON to display content fetched from Google&#x27;s servers.
* For contextual advertisements, Google&#x27;s servers use a web cache of the page created by its Mediabot &quot;crawler&quot; to determine a set of high-value keywords. If keywords have been cached already, advertisements are served for those keywords based on the Ads bidding system.
* For website-targeted advertisements, the advertiser chooses the page(s) on which to display advertisements, and pays based on cost per mille (CPM), or the price advertisers choose to pay for every thousand advertisements displayed.
* For referrals, Google adds money to the advertiser&#x27;s account when visitors either download the referred software or subscribe to the referred service. The referral program was retired in August 2008.
* Search advertisements are added to the list of results after the visitor/user performs a search.
* Because the JavaScript is sent to the Web browser when the page is requested, it is possible for other website owners to copy the JavaScript code into their own webpages. To protect against this type of fraud, AdSense publishers can specify the pages on which advertisements should be shown. AdSense then ignores clicks from pages other than those specified. (see Click fraud for more information).

==Reception==
Some webmasters create websites tailored to lure searchers from Google and other engines onto their AdSense website to make money from clicks. Such websites often contain nothing but a large amount of interconnected, automated content (e.g., a directory with content from the Open Directory Project, or &quot;scraper&quot; websites relying on RSS feeds for content). Possibly the most popular form of such &quot;AdSense farms&quot; are splogs (spam blogs), which are poorly written content centered around known high-paying keywords. Many of these websites reuse content from other websites, such as Wikipedia, to attract visitors. These and related approaches are considered to be search engine spam and can be reported to Google. A Made for AdSense (MFA) website or webpage has little or no content, but is filled with advertisements so that users have no choice but to click on advertisements. Such pages were tolerated in the past, but due to complaints, Google now disables such accounts. There have also been reports of Trojan horses engineered to produce counterfeit Google advertisements that are formatted looking like legitimate ones. The Trojan uploads itself onto an unsuspecting user&#x27;s computer through a webpage and then replaces the original advertisements with its own set of malicious advertisements.

In May 2014, Hagens Berman law firm filed a national class-action lawsuit against Google, claiming the company unlawfully denies payments to thousands of website owners and operators who place ads on their sites sold through Google AdWords.

There were numerous complaints in online discussion forums about a difference in treatment for publishers from China and India, namely that sites from those locations are required to be active for six months before being eligible for AdSense.
Due to alleged concerns about click fraud, Google AdSense has been criticized by some search engine optimization firms as a large source of what Google calls &quot;invalid clicks&quot;, in which one company clicks on a rival&#x27;s search engine advertisements to drive up the other company&#x27;s costs. The payment terms for webmasters have also been criticized. Google withholds payment until an account reaches US$100.

Google came under fire when the official Google AdSense Blog showcased the French video website Imineo.com. This website violated Google&#x27;s AdSense Program Policies by displaying AdSense alongside sexually explicit material. Typically, websites displaying AdSense have been banned from showing such content. Using both AdSense and Google Ads may cause a website to pay Google a commission when the website advertises itself. In some cases, AdSense displays inappropriate or offensive ads. For example, in a news story about a terrorist attack in India, an advert was generated for a (presumably non-existent) educational qualification in terrorism. AdSense uses tracking cookies that are viewed by some users as a threat to privacy. AdSense terms of service require that sites using AdSense explain the use of these cookies in their privacy policy.

<doc id="736240" wikidata="Q681050" url="?curid=736240" title="Extremes on Earth">
<text>This article lists extreme locations on Earth that hold geographical records or are otherwise known for their geophysical or meteorological superlatives. All of these locations are Earth-wide extremes; extremes of individual continents or countries are not listed.

==Latitude and longitude==
===Northernmost===
* The northernmost point of land is the northern tip of Kaffeklubben Island, north of Greenland (), which lies slightly north of Cape Morris Jesup, Greenland (). Various shifting gravel bars lie farther north, the most famous being Oodaaq. There have been other islands more northern such as 83-42 and ATOW1996 but they have not been confirmed as permanent.

===Southernmost===
* The southernmost continental point of land outside Antarctica is in South America at Cape Froward, Magallanes Region, Chile ().
* The southernmost point of (liquid) water is a bay on the Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelf along the coast of Antarctica (), about south of Berkner Island.
** The southernmost point of ocean is located on the Gould Coast ().
** The southernmost point of open ocean is in the Bay of Whales, also part of the Ross Sea, at 78°30&#x27;S, at the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf.
*** The southernmost island is considered to be Deverall Island, near the Shackleton Coast, surrounded by the Ross Ice Shelf although there is an island in Lake Vostok but it is currently under ice.

===Easternmost and westernmost===
* The easternmost and westernmost points on Earth, based on the east–west standard for describing longitude, can be found anywhere along the 180th meridian, which passes through the Arctic, Pacific, and Southern Oceans, as well as parts of Siberia (including Wrangel Island), Antarctica, and three islands of Fiji (Vanua Levu&#x27;s eastern peninsula, the middle of Taveuni, and the western part of Rabi Island).
** Using instead the path of the International Date Line (which is not a straight line), the westernmost point on land is Attu Island, Alaska, and the easternmost point on land is Caroline Island, Kiribati.

===Longest grid lines===
====Along constant latitude====
* The longest continuous east–west distance on land is along the latitude 48°24&#x27;53&quot;N, from the west coast of France (Pointe de Corsen, ) through Central Europe, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and China, to a point on the east coast of Russia ().
* The longest continuous east–west distance at sea is along the latitude 55°59&#x27;S, south of Cape Horn, South America.
** The longest continuous east–west distance at sea between two continents is along the latitude 18°39&#x27;12&quot;N, from the coast of Hainan, China () across the Pacific Ocean to the coast of Michoacán, Mexico ().

====Along constant longitude====
* The longest continuous north–south distance on land is along the meridian 99°1&#x27;30&quot;E, from the northern tip of Siberia in the Russian Federation (), through Mongolia, China, and Myanmar, to a point on the south coast of Thailand ().
** The longest in Africa is along the meridian 20°12&#x27;E, from the north coast of Libya (), through Chad, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, Namibia, and Botswana, to the south coast of South Africa ().
** The longest in South America is the length along the meridian 70°2&#x27;W, from the north coast of Venezuela (), through Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Chile, to the southern tip of Argentina ().
** The longest in North America is along the meridian 97°52&#x27;30&quot;W, from northern Canada (), through the United States, to southern Mexico ().
* The longest continuous north–south distance at sea is along the meridian 34°45&#x27;45&quot;W, from the coast of Eastern Greenland () across the Atlantic Ocean to the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf, on the coast of Antarctica (). The longest in the Pacific Ocean is along the meridian 172°8&#x27;30&quot;W, from the coast of Siberia () to the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica ().
* The meridian that crosses the greatest total distance on land (disregarding intervening bodies of water) is still to be determined. It is likely located in the vicinity of 22°E, which is the longest integer meridian that fits that criterion, crossing a total of of land through Europe (), Africa (), and Antarctica (). More than 65% of this meridian&#x27;s length is located on land. The next six longest integer meridians by total distance over land are, in order:
** 23°E: through Europe (), Africa (), and Antarctica ()
** 27°E: through Europe (), Asia (), Africa (), and Antarctica ()
** 25°E: through Europe (), Africa (), and Antarctica ()
** 26°E: through Europe (), Africa (), and Antarctica ()
** 24°E: through Europe (), Africa (), and Antarctica ()
** 28°E: through Europe (), Asia (), and Africa ()

====Along any geodesic====
These are the longest straight lines that can be drawn between any two points on the surface of the Earth and remain exclusively over land or water; the points need not lie on the same line of latitude or longitude.
* The longest continuous straight-line (great circle) path over land is long and spans between the West African coast near Greenville, Liberia () and a peninsula about northeast of Wenzhou, China (), passing over the Suez Canal.
** The longest continuous straight-line land distance solely within continental Africa is , along a line that begins just east of Tangier, Morocco, and ends east of Port Elizabeth, South Africa. This line passes through Morocco, Algeria, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa.
** The longest continuous straight-line land distance solely within continental Asia is , along a line that begins on the Indian coast near Kanyakumari and ends at the Bering Sea coast of the Chukchi Peninsula in Russia. This line passes through India, Nepal, China, Mongolia, and Russia.
** The longest continuous straight-line land distance solely within continental Europe (defining the Ural Mountains as the border between Europe and Asia) is , along a line that begins at Cape St. Vincent, Portugal, and ends at the Urals, near the town of Perm, Russia. This line passes through Portugal, Spain, France, Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, and Russia.
** The longest continuous straight-line land distance solely within continental North America is , along a line that begins at Point Hope, Alaska, United States, and ends southwest of the town of Salina Cruz, Mexico. This line passes through Alaska, Canada, the contiguous United States, and Mexico.
** The longest continuous straight-line land distance solely within continental South America is , along a line that begins northeast of Puerto Cumarebo, Venezuela, and ends south of the town of Punta Arenas, Chile. This line passes through Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Argentina.
** The longest continuous straight-line land distance solely within continental Australia is , along a line that begins at the southern end of Cape Range National Park in Western Australia and ends at the town of Byron Bay in New South Wales. 
* There are several possible candidates for the longest continuous straight-line distance in any direction at sea, as there are many possible ways to travel along a great circle for more than the antipodic length of . Some examples of such routes would be:
** From the south coast of Balochistan province somewhere near Port of Karachi, Pakistan () across the Arabian Sea, southwest through the Indian Ocean, near Comoros, passing Namaete Canyon, near the South African coast, across the South Atlantic Ocean, then west across Cape Horn, then northwest across the Pacific Ocean, near Easter Island, passing the antipodal point near Emlilia island, through the South Bering Sea and ending somewhere on the northeast coast of Kamchatka, near Ossora (). This route is long. This route was confirmed to be the longest (at about ) given map data at a level of resolution.
** From the south coast of Hormozgan province, Iran () across the Gulf of Oman, southeast across the Arabian Sea, passing south of Australia and New Zealand, near the Antarctic coast, then northeast across the South Pacific Ocean, passing the antipodal point and ending on the southwest coast of Mexico somewhere near Ciudad Lázaro Cárdenas (). This route is long.
** From Invercargill, New Zealand () across Cape Horn, then off the coast of Brazil close to Recife, passing north of Cape Verde, passing the antipodal point and ending somewhere on the southwest coast of Ireland (). This route is long.

====Along any diameter (straight line passing through the centre of the Earth)====
As distinct from geodesic lines, which appear straight only when projected onto the spheroidal surface of the Earth (i.e. arcs of great circles), straight lines passing through the Earth&#x27;s centre can be constructed through the interior of the Earth between almost any two points on the surface of the Earth (some extreme topographical situations such as overhanging cliffs being the rare exceptions). A line projected from the summit of Cayambe in Ecuador (see highest points) through the axial centre of the Earth to its antipode on the island of Sumatra results in the longest diameter that can be produced anywhere through the Earth. As the variable circumference of the Earth approaches , such a maximum &quot;diameter&quot; or &quot;antipodal&quot; line would be on the order of long.

==Elevation==
===Highest points===
* The highest point on Earth&#x27;s surface measured from sea level is the summit of Mount Everest, on the border of Nepal and China. While measurements of its height vary slightly, the elevation of its peak was most recently established in 2020 by the Nepali and Chinese authorities as above sea level. The summit was first reached probably by Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa of Nepal in 1953.
* The point farthest from Earth&#x27;s centre is the summit of Chimborazo in Ecuador, at from Earth&#x27;s centre; the peak&#x27;s elevation relative to sea level is . Because Earth is an oblate spheroid rather than a perfect sphere, it is wider at the equator and narrower toward each pole. Therefore, the summit of Chimborazo, which is near the Equator, is farther away from Earth&#x27;s centre than the summit of Mount Everest is; the latter is closer, at from Earth&#x27;s centre. Peru&#x27;s Huascarán (at ) contends closely with Chimborazo, though the former is a mere closer to the Earth&#x27;s centre.
* The fastest point on Earth or, in other words, the point farthest from Earth&#x27;s rotational axis is the summit of Cayambe in Ecuador, which rotates around Earth&#x27;s axis at a speed of and is from the axis. Like Chimborazo, which is the fourth-fastest peak at , Cayambe is close to the Equator and takes advantage of the oblate spheroid figure of Earth. More important, however, Cayambe&#x27;s proximity to the Equator means that the majority of its distance from the Earth&#x27;s centre contributes to Cayambe&#x27;s distance from the Earth&#x27;s axis.

====Highest geographical features====
* The highest volcano is Ojos del Salado on the Argentina–Chile border. It has the highest summit, , of any volcano on Earth.
* The highest natural lake is an unnamed crater lake on Ojos del Salado at , on the Argentina side. Another candidate was Lhagba Pool on the northeast slopes of Mount Everest, Tibet, at an elevation of , which has since dried up.
* The highest navigable lake is Lake Titicaca, on the border of Bolivia and Peru in the Andes, at .
* The highest glacier is the Khumbu Glacier on the southwest slopes of Mount Everest in Nepal, beginning on the west side of Lhotse at an elevation of .
* The highest river is disputed; one candidate from many possibilities is the Ating Ho, which flows into the Aong Tso (Hagung Tso), a large lake in Tibet, and has an elevation of about at its source at . Another very large and high river is the Yarlung Tsangpo or upper Brahmaputra River in Tibet, whose main stem, the Maquan River, has its source at about above sea level at . Above these elevations, there are no constantly flowing rivers since the temperature is almost always below freezing.
* The highest island is one of a number of islands in the Orba Co lake in Tibet, at an elevation of .

====Highest points attainable by transportation====
* The highest point accessible
**by land vehicle is an elevation of on Ojos del Salado in Chile, which was reached by the Chilean duo of Gonzalo and Eduardo Canales Moya on 21 April 2007 with a modified Suzuki Samurai, setting the high-altitude record for a four-wheeled vehicle.
** by road (dead end) is on a mining road to the summit of Aucanquilcha in Chile, which reaches an elevation of . It was once usable by 20-tonne mining trucks. The road is no longer usable. 
** by road (mountain pass) is disputed; there are a number of competing claims for this title due to the definition of &quot;motorable pass&quot; (i.e. a surfaced road or one simply passable by a vehicle):
*** The highest asphalted road is the single-lane road to Umling La, located west of Demchok in Ladakh, India, which reaches (&quot;19,300 feet&quot; according to a Border Roads Organisation sign there that recognizes it as the &quot;World&#x27;s Highest Motorable Pass&quot;). Before the asphalting of the road over Umling La, the highest asphalted road was Tibet&#x27;s Semo La pass at . It is used by trucks and buses regularly. The Ticlio pass, on the Central Road of Peru, is the highest surfaced road in the Americas, at an elevation of .
*** The highest unsurfaced road has several different claimants. All are unsurfaced or gravel roads including Mana Pass, between India and Tibet, which is crossed by a gravel road reaching . The heavily trafficked Khardung La in Ladakh lies at . A possibly motorable gravel road crosses Marsimik La in Ladakh at .
** by train is Tanggula Pass, located on the Qinghai–Tibet (Qingzang) Railway in the Tanggula Mountains of Qinghai/Tibet, China, at . The Tanggula railway station is the world&#x27;s highest railway station at . Before the Qingzang Railway was built, the highest railway ran between Lima and Huancayo in Peru, reaching at Ticlio.
** by oceangoing vessel is a segment of the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal between the Hilpoltstein and Bachhausen locks in Bavaria, Germany. The locks artificially raise the surface level of the water in the canal to above mean sea level, higher than any other lock system in the world, making it the highest point currently accessible by oceangoing commercial watercraft.

* The highest commercial airport is Daocheng Yading Airport, Sichuan, China, at . The proposed Nagqu Dagring Airport in Tibet, if built, will be higher at .
* The highest helipad is Sonam, Siachen Glacier, India, at a height of above sea level.
* The highest permanent human settlement is La Rinconada, Peru, , in the Peruvian Andes.
* The farthest road from the Earth&#x27;s centre is the Road to Carrel Hut in the Ecuadorian Andes, at an elevation of above sea level and a distance of from the centre of the Earth.

===Lowest points===
====Lowest natural points====

* The deepest point below the ocean&#x27;s atmospheric surface is Challenger Deep, at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, below sea level. Jacques Piccard and U.S. Navy Lieutenant Don Walsh first reached Challenger Deep in 1960 aboard the bathyscaphe &quot;Trieste&quot;, followed by filmmaker James Cameron in 2012 aboard &quot;Deepsea Challenger&quot;. Between 2020 and 2022, DSV &quot;Limiting Factor&quot; made 19 dives to Challenger Deep, carrying with it 19 further visitors.
* The deepest known cave is in the Krubera Cave in Abkhazia, Georgia, with its deepest known point 2,199 ± 20 metres (7,215 ± 66 ft) below its entrance. The record was set in 2006, and it remains one of only two known caves deeper than 2,000 meters.

* The lowest point on land not covered by liquid water is the canyon under Denman Glacier in Antarctica, with the bedrock being below sea level.

* The lowest point on dry land is the shore of the Dead Sea, shared by Israel, Palestine and Jordan, below sea level. As the Dead Sea waters are receding, the water surface level drops more than per year.
* The point on the atmospheric surface closest to the Earth&#x27;s centre (interpreted as a natural surface of the land or sea that is accessible by a person) is the surface of the Arctic Ocean at the Geographic North Pole ().
** The point on the surface of Earth&#x27;s crust closest to the Earth&#x27;s centre (interpreted as a land surface or sea floor) is the bottom of Litke Deep, in the Arctic Ocean, at from Earth&#x27;s centre; the deep&#x27;s depth relative to sea level is . Because Earth is an oblate spheroid rather than a perfect sphere, it is wider at the equator and narrower toward each pole. Therefore, the bottom of Litke Deep, which is near the North Pole, is closer to Earth&#x27;s centre than the bottom of Challenger Deep is; the latter is further, at from Earth&#x27;s centre. Molloy Deep, also in Arctic Ocean (at ) from Earth&#x27;s centre contends closely with Litke Deep, the difference from Earth&#x27;s centre being just .
** The point on the ocean surface farthest below sea level is located in the Indian Ocean, about southwest of India, the Indian Ocean Geoid Low, about below the global mean sea level.

====Lowest artificial points====
* The lowest point underground ever reached was deep (SG-3 at the Kola Superdeep Borehole, which has since been enclosed).
* The lowest human-sized point underground is below ground at the TauTona Mine, Carletonville, South Africa.
* The lowest (from sea level) artificially made point with open sky may be the Hambach surface mine, Germany, which reaches a depth of below sea level.
* The lowest (from surface) artificially made point with open sky may be the Bingham Canyon Open Pit Copper Mine, Utah, United States, at a depth of below surface level.
* The lowest point underwater is the -deep (as measured from the subsea wellhead) oil and gas well drilled on the Tiber Oil Field in the Gulf of Mexico. The wellhead of this well is an additional underwater, for a total distance of as measured from sea level. 

====Lowest points attainable by transportation====
* The lowest point accessible:
** by road, excluding roads in mines, is any of the roads alongside the Dead Sea in Israel, Palestine and Jordan, which are the lowest on Earth at below sea level.
*** The lowest undersea highway tunnel is the Ryfast tunnel in Norway, at below sea level.
** by train, excluding tracks in mines, is located in the Seikan Tunnel in Japan, at below sea level. For comparison, the undersea Channel Tunnel between England and France reaches a depth of below sea level.
** by ship, is located in the Indian Ocean, about southwest of India, the Indian Ocean Geoid Low, about below the global mean sea level.
** Some mines have roads accessible from outside or rail tracks, located more than two thousand metres below sea level, for example in some South African gold mines.
* The lowest railroad station was formerly the Japanese Yoshioka-Kaitei Station, at below sea level, but it closed in 2014. The lowest railroad station not inside a tunnel is below sea level, at Beit She&#x27;an railway station in Israel.
* The lowest airfield is the Bar Yehuda Airfield, near Masada, Israel, at below sea level.
* The lowest international airport is Atyrau Airport, near Atyrau, Kazakhstan, at below sea level, in the basin of the Caspian Sea.
* The lowest major city is Baku, Azerbaijan, located below sea level, which makes it the lowest-lying national capital in the world and also the largest city in the world located below sea level.

===Table of extreme elevations and air temperatures by continent===

==Humans and biogeography==


In contrast to places with the highest density of life, like terrestrial tropical regions, and beside local extreme conditions, which might only be overcome by extremophiles, there are areas of extreme low amounts of life.

Next to terrestrial lifeless areas like the Antarctic desert&#x27;s McMurdo Dry Valleys and its Don Juan Pond, the most lifeless area in the ocean studied (other than the more general dead zones) is the South Pacific Gyre, corresponding to the oceanic pole of inaccessibility.

The oceanic pole of inaccessibility is also the antipodal area of the human center of population which lies today around southern Central Asia. Similarly the world&#x27;s economic center of gravity has been drifting since antiquity from Central Asia to Northern Europe and contemporarily back to Central Asia. The related centre of gravity of the worlds carbon emission has shifted from Britain during the Industrial Revolution to the Atlantic, back again and contemporarily into Central Asia.

==Remoteness==
===Poles of inaccessibility===

Each continent has its own continental pole of inaccessibility, defined as the place on the continent that is farthest from any ocean. Similarly, each ocean has its own oceanic pole of inaccessibility, defined as the place in the ocean that is farthest from any land.
====Continental====
* The most distant point from an ocean is the Eurasian Pole of Inaccessibility (or &quot;EPIA&quot;) , in China&#x27;s Xinjiang region near the border with Kazakhstan. Calculations have shown that this point, located in the Dzoosotoyn Elisen Desert, is from the nearest coastline. The nearest settlement to the EPIA is Suluk at , about to the east. A 2007 study suggests that the historical calculation of the EPIA failed to recognize the point where the Gulf of Ob joins the Arctic Ocean, and proposes instead that varying definitions of coastline could result in other locations for the EPIA:
** EPIA1, somewhere between and , is about from the nearest ocean.
** EPIA2, somewhere between and , is about from the nearest ocean.
:If adopted, this would place the final EPIA roughly closer to the ocean than the point that is currently agreed upon. Coincidentally, EPIA1, or EPIA2, and the most remote of the Oceanic Pole of Inaccessibility (specifically, the point in the South Pacific Ocean that is farthest from land) are similarly remote; EPIA1 is less than closer to the ocean than the Oceanic Pole of Inaccessibility is to land.
* The continental poles of inaccessibility for the other continents are as follows:
** Africa: , close to the tripoint of the Central African Republic, South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo
** Australia: either , or , near Papunya, Northern Territory
** North America: , between Kyle, South Dakota and Allen, South Dakota, United States.
** South America: , near Arenápolis, Mato Grosso, Brazil

====Oceanic====
* The most distant point from land is the Pacific pole of inaccessibility (also called &quot;Point Nemo&quot;, in a region known as the spacecraft cemetery), which lies in the South Pacific Ocean at , about from the nearest land (equidistant from Ducie Island in the Pitcairn Islands to the north, Motu Nui off Rapa Nui to the northeast, and Maher Island off Siple Island near Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica, to the south). The centre of the Pacific Ocean and the Water Hemisphere lie west to it, closer to Oceania, off the coast of Kiribati at and New Zealand at respectively.

===Other places considered the most remote===

* The most remote island is Bouvet Island, a small, uninhabited island in the South Atlantic Ocean that is a dependency of Norway. It lies at coordinates . The nearest land is the uninhabited Queen Maud Land, Antarctica (also claimed by Norway), over to the south. The nearest inhabited lands are Gough Island, away, Tristan da Cunha, away, and the coast of South Africa, away.
* The title for most remote inhabited island or archipelago (the farthest away from any other permanently inhabited place) depends on how the question is interpreted. If the south Atlantic island Tristan da Cunha (population about 300) and its dependency Gough Island (with a small staffed research post), which are from each other, are considered part of the same archipelago, or if Gough Island is not counted because it has no permanent residents, then Tristan da Cunha is the world&#x27;s most remote inhabited island/archipelago: the main island, also called Tristan da Cunha, is from the island Saint Helena, from South Africa, and from South America. It is away from uninhabited Bouvet Island. However, if Gough and Tristan da Cunha are considered separately, they disqualify each other, and the most remote inhabited island is Easter Island in the South Pacific Ocean, which lies from Pitcairn Island (about 50 residents in 2013), from Rikitea on the island of Mangareva (the nearest town with a population over 500), and from the coast of Chile (the nearest continental point and the country of which Easter Island is part). The Kerguelen Islands in the southern Indian Ocean are another contender, lying from the small Alfred Faure scientific station in Île de la Possession, but otherwise more than from the coast of Madagascar (the nearest permanently inhabited place), northwest of the uninhabited Heard Island and McDonald Islands (both a part of Australia), and from the non-permanent scientific station located in Île Amsterdam.
* Remote cities
** The most remote city with a population in excess of one million from the nearest city with a population in excess of one million is Auckland, New Zealand. The nearest city of comparable size or greater is Sydney, Australia, away.
** The most remote city with a population in excess of one million from the nearest city with a population above 100,000 is Perth, Australia, located away from Adelaide, Australia.
** The most remote city with a population in excess of 100,000 from the nearest city with a population in excess of 100,000 is Honolulu, Hawaii, United States. The nearest city of comparable size or greater is San Francisco, away.
** The most remote national capitals are Wellington, New Zealand, and Canberra, Australia, which are apart from each other and neither is closer to another capital. 
* The most remote airport in the world from another airport is Mataveri International Airport (IPC) on Easter Island, which has a single runway for military and public use. It is located from Totegegie Airport (GMR; very few flights) in the Gambier Islands, French Polynesia and from Santiago, Chile (SCL; a fairly large airport). In comparison, the airport at the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station (NZSP) is not very remote at all, being located only from Williams Field (NZWD) near Ross Island.

===Farthest-apart cities===
The pairs of cities (with a population over 100,000) with the greatest distance between them (antipodes) are:
# Xinghua, China to Rosario, Argentina: 
# Lu&#x27;an, China to Río Cuarto, Argentina: 
# Subang Jaya, Malaysia to Cuenca, Ecuador: 
# Shanghai, China to Concordia, Argentina: 
# Xi&#x27;an, China to Rancagua, Chile: 
# Rui&#x27;an, China to Resistencia, Argentina: 
# Yantai, China to Tandil, Argentina: 
# Lichuan, China to Coquimbo, Chile: 
# Bandung, Indonesia to Piedecuesta, Colombia: 
# Salamanca, Spain to Lower Hutt, New Zealand: 

The pair of airports with scheduled flights having the greatest distance between them are Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II International Airport, which serves Palembang, Indonesia, and Benito Salas Airport, which serves Neiva, Colombia, located about 10,819 nautical miles (20,037 km) apart.

==Centre==
Since the Earth is a spheroid, its centre (the core) is thousands of kilometres beneath its crust. Still, there have been attempts to define various &quot;centrepoints&quot; on the Earth&#x27;s surface.
* The centre of the standard geographic model as viewed on a traditional world map is the point 0°, 0° (the coordinates of zero degrees latitude by zero degrees longitude), which is located in the Atlantic Ocean about south of Accra, Ghana, in the Gulf of Guinea. It lies at the intersection of the Equator and the Prime Meridian, is marked with a buoy, and is sometimes called Null Island. However, the selection of the Prime Meridian as the 0° longitude meridian depended on cultural and historical factors and is therefore geographically arbitrary (any of the Earth&#x27;s meridians could, in principle, be defined as 0° longitude); consequently, the position of the &quot;Null Island&quot; centrepoint is also arbitrary.
* The centre of population, the place to which there is the shortest average route for every individual human being in the world, could also be considered a &quot;centre of the world&quot;. This point is located in the north of the Indian subcontinent, although the precise location has never been calculated and is constantly shifting due to changes in the distribution of the human population across the planet.

==Geophysical extremes==
===Tallest mountain===

* Mauna Kea, tallest mountain from base-to-peak, with a dry prominence of and a wet prominence above sea level of .
* Denali (federally designated as Mount McKinley), tallest mountain from base-to-peak on land, measuring .

===Greatest vertical drop===

=== Longest ===

* Great Escarpment, South Africa is the longest surface escarpment at 5,000 km long

=== Subterranean ===

===Greatest oceanic depths===
===Deepest ice===
Ice sheets on land, but having the base below sea level. Places under ice are not considered to be on land.
==Meteorological extremes==
===Coldest and hottest inhabited places on Earth===
===Ground temperatures===
Temperatures measured directly on the ground may exceed air temperatures by 30 to 50 °C. A ground temperature of 84 °C (183.2 °F) has been recorded in Port Sudan, Sudan. A ground temperature of 93.9 °C (201 °F) was recorded in Furnace Creek, Death Valley, California, United States on 15 July 1972; this may be the highest natural ground surface temperature ever recorded. The theoretical maximum possible ground surface temperature has been estimated to be between 90 and 100 °C for dry, darkish soils of low thermal conductivity.

Satellite measurements of ground temperature taken between 2003 and 2009, taken with the MODIS infrared spectroradiometer on the Aqua satellite, found a maximum temperature of 70.7 °C (159.3 °F), which was recorded in 2005 in the Lut Desert, Iran. The Lut Desert was also found to have the highest maximum temperature in 5 of the 7 years measured (2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009). These measurements reflect averages over a large region and so are lower than the maximum point surface temperature.

Satellite measurements of the surface temperature of Antarctica, taken between 1982 and 2013, found a coldest temperature of −93.2 °C (−136 °F) on 10 August 2010, at . Although this is not comparable to an air temperature, it is believed that the air temperature at this location would have been lower than the official record lowest air temperature of −89.2 °C.
