<text>Reactive-ion etching (RIE) is an etching technology used in microfabrication. RIE is a type of dry etching which has different characteristics than wet etching. RIE uses chemically reactive plasma to remove material deposited on wafers. The plasma is generated under low pressure (vacuum) by an electromagnetic field. High-energy ions from the plasma attack the wafer surface and react with it.

== Equipment ==
A typical (parallel plate) RIE system consists of a cylindrical vacuum chamber, with a wafer platter situated in the bottom portion of the chamber. The wafer platter is electrically isolated from the rest of the chamber. Gas enters through small inlets in the top of the chamber, and exits to the vacuum pump system through the bottom. The types and amount of gas used vary depending upon the etch process; for instance, sulfur hexafluoride is commonly used for etching silicon. Gas pressure is typically maintained in a range between a few millitorr and a few hundred millitorr by adjusting gas flow rates and/or adjusting an exhaust orifice.

Other types of RIE systems exist, including inductively coupled plasma (ICP) RIE. In this type of system, the plasma is generated with a radio frequency (RF) powered magnetic field. Very high plasma densities can be achieved, though etch profiles tend to be more isotropic.

A combination of parallel plate and inductively coupled plasma RIE is possible. In this system, the ICP is employed as a high density source of ions which increases the etch rate, whereas a separate RF bias is applied to the substrate (silicon wafer) to create directional electric fields near the substrate to achieve more anisotropic etch profiles. The RF power given to the substrate is often a tunable parameter called &#x27;platen power&#x27;, and controls the energy of ions bombarding the surface.

== Method of operation ==
Plasma is initiated in the system by applying a strong RF (radio frequency) electromagnetic field to the wafer platter. The field is typically set to a frequency of 13.56 Megahertz, applied at a few hundred watts. The oscillating electric field ionizes the gas molecules by stripping them of electrons, creating a plasma.

In each cycle of the field, the electrons are electrically accelerated up and down in the chamber, sometimes striking both the upper wall of the chamber and the wafer platter. At the same time, the much more massive ions move relatively little in response to the RF electric field. When electrons are absorbed into the chamber walls they are simply fed out to ground and do not alter the electronic state of the system. However, electrons deposited on the wafer platter cause the platter to build up charge due to its DC isolation. This charge build up develops a large negative voltage on the platter, typically around a few hundred volts. The plasma itself develops a slightly positive charge due to the higher concentration of positive ions compared to free electrons.

Because of the large voltage difference, the positive ions tend to drift toward the wafer platter, where they collide with the samples to be etched. The ions react chemically with the materials on the surface of the samples, but can also knock off (sputter) some material by transferring some of their kinetic energy. Due to the mostly vertical delivery of reactive ions, reactive-ion etching can produce very anisotropic etch profiles, which contrast with the typically isotropic profiles of wet chemical etching.

Etch conditions in an RIE system depend strongly on the many process parameters, such as pressure, gas flows, and RF power. A modified version of RIE is deep reactive-ion etching, used to excavate deep features.

<text>A Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) is a version of a Boeing jet airliner with modifications to serve the private, head of state, and corporate jet market. The first BBJ, based on the 737-700, rolled out on July 26, 1998; and had its first flight on September 4, 1998. The BBJ name later came to represent any Boeing aircraft modified to serve in a business jet role. 

The first BBJ (later renamed the BBJ1) was first designed in 1996 as a high-performance derivative of the Boeing 737 Next Generation by Borge Boeskov, at the request of Phil Condit, president of Boeing, and Jack Welch, chairman and CEO of General Electric. Since its introduction, over 260 BBJs have been delivered.

Boeing expanded the BBJ brand to include configurations based on the 737 MAX, 777, 777X, 787 Dreamliner and 747-8 Intercontinental, which are known as BBJ 737 MAX, BBJ 777, BBJ 777X, BBJ 787, and BBJ 747-8, respectively. Boeing currently produces the BBJ 737 MAX and BBJ 787. 

After the launch of the BBJ, Airbus followed suit with the launch of the Airbus Corporate Jet (ACJ) program. Other smaller competitors include the Embraer Lineage, the Bombardier Global Express, the Gulfstream G550 and the Gulfstream G650.

==Models==

=== Current production models ===
==== Narrow body ====
The primary product offered by Boeing Business Jets is the BBJ 737 MAX family. Launch was announced on April 2, 2014, and the first delivery occurred on October 15, 2018. The BBJ MAX replaces and improves upon the original BBJ 737 family, featuring a lower 6,500 ft cabin altitude for enhanced passenger comfort as well as a 15% reduction in fuel burn and an increase in range to over 6,000 nmi brought by new CFM LEAP-1B engines, improved aerodynamics, auxiliary fuel tanks, and other systems. 
The BBJ MAX is based on the Boeing 737 MAX family of aircraft. Unlike most commercial 737s, the BBJ MAX is fitted with retractable airstairs to allow independent operations at remote airfields. BBJ MAX aircraft are also equipped with all of the optional extra features available on commercial 737s, as well as the highest takeoff weight certification and maximum available engine thrust option.

The BBJ MAX also benefits from its commercial counterparts. Direct operating costs are estimated at $5,200 to $5,600 per hour, which is lower than many purpose-built business jets of similar size. This efficiency is partly enabled by a low utilization maintenance program, which lengthens the distance between maintenance intervals for BBJ operators – major checks occurring every four years, and heavy checks only once every 12 years.
* BBJ 737-7 (BBJ MAX 7) is a variant of the Boeing 737 MAX 7. It is 6 ft 4 in (1.93m) longer than the original BBJ1 and features a range of 6,600 nmi (12,225 km; ), which is 445 nmi (825 km; ) further than the BBJ1. The 737-7 is currently undergoing certification.
* BBJ 737-8 (BBJ MAX 8) is a variant of the Boeing 737 MAX 8. It first flew on April 16, 2018, and was first delivered in October of that year. The middle member of the family offers a strong combination of size and range.
* BBJ 737-9 (BBJ MAX 9) is a variant of the Boeing 737 MAX 9 and is the largest member of the BBJ MAX family, offering a cabin floor area of 1,120 sq ft (104.1 m2). The first BBJ 737-9 was delivered green on August 18, 2021.
In 2023, the equipped price of the BBJ MAX 7 was $101.5M, $110.5M for the MAX 8, and $118.5M for the MAX 9.

===== Specifications =====
==== Wide Body ====
BBJ 787 Family: Based on Boeing&#x27;s commercial 787 Dreamliner, the BBJ 787 is a large business jet featuring a composite airframe and low cabin altitude system. The BBJ 787−8 and the BBJ 787-9 are long-range aircraft, with ranges of 9,960 nmi (18,445 km; ) and 9,475 nmi (17,550 km; ), respectively, with 25 passengers. Eighteen were ordered through September 2022 with 16 delivered. 

BBJ 777X Family: Boeing launched BBJ variants of the 777X at the Middle East Business Aviation Association show in December 2018. The BBJ 777-8 and 777-9 will have ranges of 11,835 nmi (21,920 km; ) and 11,330 nmi (20,985 km; ), respectively, giving it the capability to fly more than halfway around the world without stopping, the longest of any current business jet. Now the largest business jets in the world, these aircraft have cabin areas of 3,256 and 3,689 sq. ft. (302.5 and 342.7 sq m) cabin. The cabin area of the 777-9 is larger than the main deck of a 747-400 and will be 30% cheaper to operate per hour. The 777X is currently undergoing certification before entry into service, currently expected in 2025. 

===== Specifications =====
=== Out-of-production models ===
;Narrow-body
The BBJ (retroactively referred to as the BBJ1) was similar in dimensions to the Boeing 737-700 but had additional features, including stronger wings and landing gear from the Boeing 737-800. It offered up to nine auxiliary belly fuel tanks to extend the aircraft&#x27;s range to over . Aviation Partners winglets became standard on the BBJ, giving it a 5% range boost. The first BBJ rolled out on August 11, 1998, and flew for the first time on September 4. A total of 113 BBJ1s were delivered to customers. 

On October 11, 1999, Boeing launched the BBJ2. Based on the 737-800, it is longer than the BBJ1, with 25% more cabin space and twice the baggage space, but with slightly reduced range. It is also fitted with auxiliary fuel tanks in the cargo hold and winglets. The first BBJ2 was delivered on February 28, 2001. A total of 23 BBJ2s were delivered to customers.

The BBJ3 aircraft is based on the 737-900ER aircraft. The BBJ3 is approximately longer than the BBJ2 and has a slightly shorter range. Seven BBJ3s were delivered to customers.

During its 20 years of production, 143 BBJs entered service, nearly triple the initial forecast of 50. Boeing delivered the last BBJ based on the 737NG in 2021.

;Wide-body
Boeing previously offered BBJs based on the 747-8 Intercontinental, the final model of the venerable 747 family, and BBJs based on the 777 aircraft.

* BBJ 747: The 2nd largest business jet ever produced, it offered over 4,700 sq ft (440 m2) of cabin area, across the main and upper decks. It had a range of with 100 passengers. Seventeen were ordered, and all have been delivered.
* BBJ 777: The BBJ 777-200LR and BBJ 777-300ER, based on the commercial 777s of those variants, were offered prior to the introduction of the BBJ 777X family. They offered ranges of with 75 passengers, respectively. Seventeen were ordered, and all have been delivered.

==Operators==

===Private===
BBJs were initially operated by Fortune 100 companies like Aramco and Tracinda, NetJets, and casinos like the Las Vegas Sands. However, the 2008 recession put ultra-large jets under scrutiny, and they were divested by many companies including The Limited, General Electric, and Occidental Petroleum. Similarly, Xi Jinping&#x27;s anti-corruption campaign reduced the conspicuous consumption of private jets in China.
BBJs are now operated by private firms and individuals: Fresno&#x27;s Assemi Group, Miami&#x27;s Crescent Heights, Wichita&#x27;s Town &amp; Country Food Market, Funair Corp., toymaker Ty, Fortress Transportation &amp; Instructure, Jeffrey Katzenberg, John Travolta, Steven Spielberg, Washington Corp., Tutor Saliba or pachinko king Hideyuki Busujima, with many registrations hiding their owners’ identities.

===State VIP users===
Most BBJs are operated by governments for VIP transport in U.S., Australia and Africa, plus Colombia, Turkey, India, UAE, Jordan, Malaysia, South Africa and Tunisia; or Middle East oil barons like Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Saudi Arabia royalty.

<text>Samuel Clement Fessenden (March 7, 1815 – April 18, 1882) was an American abolitionist and United States Congressman from Maine.

==Early life and education==
Born in New Gloucester, Massachusetts (now in Maine), Samuel Fessenden graduated from Bowdoin College in 1834 and from Bangor Theological Seminary in 1837.

==Family==

Samuel Clement Fessenden was the son of prominent abolitionist Samuel Fessenden and brother of Treasury Secretary William Pitt Fessenden and Congressman T. A. D. Fessenden. He was an uncle of Union Army generals Francis Fessenden and James D. Fessenden.

Samuel C. Fessenden married Mary Abigail Grosvenor Abbe. Their son, Joshua Abbe Fessenden, who was born in Rockland, Maine, served in the United States Cavalry beginning in 1862 and was wounded at the Battle of Chickamauga. His other son, Samuel, also born in Rockland, was appointed 2nd lieutenant in the 5th Maine battery on January 18, 1865, and was a lawyer and politician in Stamford, Connecticut.

==Career==
He was ordained and installed as pastor of the Second Congregational Church of Thomaston, Maine, from 1837 to 1856. He then established the &quot;Maine Evangelist&quot; and began to study law. He was admitted to the bar and began practicing in 1858, eventually becoming judge of the Rockland municipal court.

He was elected as a Republican to the 37th Congress, serving from March 4, 1861, to March 3, 1863. During his time as a congressman, he continued to be a staunch Unionist and opponent of slavery. After leaving office, he served as an examiner in the United States Patent Office from 1865 to 1879 and then the United States consul at Saint John, New Brunswick, from 1879 to 1881.

==Death==
Fessenden died in Stamford, Connecticut, in 1882. He is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Portland, Maine.

<text>The Great Strahov Stadium () is a stadium in the Strahov district of Prague, Czech Republic. It was built for displays of synchronized gymnastics on a massive scale, with a field three times as long and three times as wide as the standard association football pitch. Its capacity of 250,000 spectators (56,000 seated) made it larger than any current or former sports stadium, and the second largest sports venue ever.

 the stadium is no longer in use for competitive sports events. It is a training centre for Sparta Prague and hosts pop and rock concerts. The stadium is located on Petřín Hill, overlooking the old city. It can be accessed by taking the Petřín funicular up the hill through the gardens, or by taking tram lines 22, 23, or 25 to Malovanka station.

==Construction==
Construction began based on plans by the architect Alois Dryák, on a wooden stadium in 1926, which was replaced by concrete grandstands in 1932. Further construction occurred in 1948 and 1975. The playing field, surrounded by seating on all sides, is 63,500 square metres.

The stadium currently serves Sparta Prague as a training centre with 8 football pitches (6 pitches of standard sizes and 2 futsal pitches).

== History ==

The original stadium dates from the First Republic between the World Wars and served as a venue for popular Sokol displays of massive synchronized gymnastics. Construction of the first stadium began in 1926 on the current ground plan for the 8th . On 14 May 1933 the stadium hosted motorcycle speedway for the first time.

The stadium was modernized in 1932 for the 9th Všesokolský slet. Both of these displays were attended by Czechoslovak President T. G. Masaryk, who had been a member of Sokol since he was thirteen, on his horse Hektor. The largest attendance was recorded in 1938 on the occasion of the jubilee &quot;World anti-war&quot; 10th Všesokolský slet.

During the Nazi occupation the stadium was used for a military parade in honor of Hitler&#x27;s 50th birthday. Later it became an assembly spot for Jews, before they were sent to concentration camps. After World War II, it was used as a temporary detention center for German-speaking Czechs awaiting expulsion.

A few months after the end of World War II in Europe, two units of the United States Army played an exhibition game of American football. On September 28, 1945, a crowd of 40,000 watched soldier-athletes of the 94th Infantry Division defeat a team from the XXII Corps, by a score of 6–0. The first motor sport event after the end of the World War II was held at the stadium on 2 September 1945.

11th Všesokolský slet in 1948 was used as a protest against rising communism. Soon after, the Sokol was dissolved and followed Spartakiades. The Sokol displays were renamed Spartakiads during the communist era. The Spartakiads also took place in the Soviet Union, East Germany and Albania.

The first World Championship speedway event held in Czechoslovakia was at the stadium when it hosted a continental qualifying round during the 1963 Individual Speedway World Championship on 9 May 1963. The last speedway meeting was held on 2 September 1973.

Performances with several thousand gymnasts making various complex formations, with some performers performing in synchronization while traditional folk music played overhead, attracted the attention of many visitors. Some of the most popular shows were those of young well-trained recruits who wore only boxer shorts while on the display or women dancing in miniskirts. The groups of volunteer gymnasts (unlike the soldiers, who were ordered to practice and participate) were put together from top level local athletic association members who regularly trained for the show throughout the year prior to the event. The event was held semi-decadally until 1985.

The last Spartakiad was held here in 1985. Renewed 12th Všesokolský slet took place here with the presence of Czech President Václav Havel in 1994. However, the next Sokol venues took place on the smaller stadiums (Stadion Evžena Rošického and Eden Arena). In 1990, Great Strahov Stadium hosted British classic rock group, The Rolling Stones. The concert had 100,000 spectators, most notably, former President Václav Havel. In 1995 Pope John Paul II used the stadium for a massive public mass. Since the 90&#x27;s, the spacious building hosted few events. Weeds and other vegetation grew on the playing surfaces, due to a lack of care. The area was also used for exhibitions and trade fairs, and was also used for exhibition polo games.

At the beginning of the 21st century, there were talks about demolishing the venue. However, those talks have since diminished. In 2003, part of the stadium, with the financial support of the City of Prague, was reconstructed by AC Sparta Prague. Eight football fields were built, and it is now used as a training centre for Sparta. In 2014, the complex management of the stadium was resolved and it is now owned by the city of Prague.

The 2019 Apple iPhone XR &quot;Color Flood&quot; commercial, which featured large numbers of people running in different colored jumpsuits, was filmed at the stadium.

==Concerts==
Since 1990, the stadium has been used for rock concerts.

*The Rolling Stones – Aug 18, 1990 &amp; Aug 5, 1995 (attendance 100,000 &amp; 127,000 respectively)
*Guns N&#x27; Roses – May 20, 1992 (attendance 60,000), with Soundgarden and Faith No More
*Bon Jovi – Sept 4, 1993 (attendance 30,000) with Billy Idol and Little Angels
*Aerosmith – May 27, 1994 (attendance 50,000) with Extreme
*Pink Floyd – Sept 7, 1994 (official attendance 110,000, but eventually another estimated 10,000 people snuck in or pushed into the venue)
*Bratři Nedvědové – June 21, 1996 (attendance 60,000)
*U2 – Aug 14, 1997 (attendance approx. 62 000)
*AC/DC – June 12, 2001 (attendance 25,000), with Rammstein
*Ozzfest – May 30, 2002 (attendance 30,000), with Ozzy Osbourne, Tool and Slayer

==Future of the stadium==
In the last decade several studies have looked at adaptive reuse and preservation of this unique structure. There are plans to convert the extremely large Great Strahov stadium complex into a commercial zone complete with hotels, restaurants and shops. Another proposition was to convert the area into a &quot;leisure mecca for the 21st century&quot;. There were plans to rebuild the area as an Olympic village if Prague won a future Olympic bid. However, the bid for 2016 was unsuccessful.

<doc id="751668" wikidata="Q1474606" url="?curid=751668" title="2004 NBA draft">
<text>The 2004 NBA draft was held on June 24, 2004, at The Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York City, and was broadcast live on ESPN at 7:00 pm (EDT). In this draft, National Basketball Association teams took turns selecting amateur college basketball players and other first-time eligible players. The NBA announced that 56 college and high school players and 38 international players had filed as early-entry candidates for the 2004 draft. On May 26, the NBA draft lottery was conducted for the teams that did not make the NBA playoffs in the 2003–04 NBA season. The Orlando Magic, who had a 25 percent chance of obtaining the first selection, won the lottery, while the Los Angeles Clippers and the Chicago Bulls were second and third respectively. As an expansion team, the Charlotte Bobcats had been assigned the fourth selection in the draft and did not participate in the lottery. The Minnesota Timberwolves forfeited their first-round pick due to salary cap violations.

By the end of the draft, around 40% of the players selected in it were born from countries outside the United States. It would remain the highest influx of international players selected in the modern NBA draft era until the 2016 NBA draft, where almost half of the selected players were born in countries outside the US. In addition, four of the players selected in the draft were Russians, which not only marked the highest number of players born in that region to be taken in one draft, but also was the highest representation of a country other than the US in one draft until 2016 when five Frenchmen would be taken in the draft.

After the completion of the regular season, Emeka Okafor, the Bobcats&#x27; historical first rookie draft pick back when they were considered an expansion franchise, was named Rookie of the Year, while Ben Gordon earned the Sixth Man Award, becoming the first rookie in NBA history to do so.

Dwight Howard has become an NBA Champion, eight-time All-Star, has received seven All-NBA selections, and a three-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year awardee. He also had the distinction as the only NBA player straight out of high school to start all 82 games as a rookie. There are also four other players that would be named All-Stars at some point in their careers, and Al Jefferson would be named to an All-NBA team. Andre Iguodala would win four championships with the Golden State Warriors and was named Finals MVP in 2015. The draft is also notable for multiple players coming straight from high school being drafted within a few picks from each other. This is currently the most recent draft class with no remaining players active in the NBA, as Iguodala announced his retirement in 2023. Howard, however, continues to play professional basketball in Taiwan. 

==Draft selections==


==Notable undrafted players==

These players not selected in the draft have played at least one game in the NBA.
==Early entrants==
===College underclassmen===
After seeing a couple of years where they missed the previous year of 75 underclassmen testing their early entry in 2001, this year saw an at the time record-high 92 players declare their initial entry into this year&#x27;s draft. However, this year also saw an at the time record high 52 underclassmen from college, overseas, or high school withdraw their names from the draft, thus leaving only 40 total underclassmen officially declaring their entry into the NBA draft. The following college basketball players successfully applied for early draft entrance.
* Chris Acker – G, Chaminade (sophomore)
* Trevor Ariza – G/F, UCLA (freshman)
* Brandon Bender – F, Robert Morris (junior)
* Evan Burns – F, San Diego State (freshman)
* Josh Childress – F/G, Stanford (junior)
* Cortez Davis – F, Midland College (sophomore)
* Luol Deng – F, Duke (freshman)
* / Ben Gordon – G, Connecticut (junior)
* Devin Harris – G, Wisconsin (junior)
* David Harrison – C, Colorado (junior)
* JaQuan Hart – G, Eastern Michigan (junior)
* Kris Humphries – F, Minnesota (freshman)
* Sani Ibrahim – F, Gulf Coast CC (sophomore)
* Andre Iguodala – F, Arizona (sophomore)
* Kevin Martin – G, Western Carolina (junior)
* Emeka Okafor – F, Connecticut (junior)
* Randy Orr – C, Georgia Perimeter (sophomore) 
* Jason Parker – F, Chipola (junior)
* Donta Smith – F/G, Southeastern Illinois (sophomore)
* Kirk Snyder – G, Nevada (junior)
* Harvey Thomas – F, Baylor (junior)
* Delonte West – G, St. Joseph&#x27;s (junior)
===High school players===
This would be the tenth straight year in a row where at least one high school player would declare their entry into the NBA draft directly out of high school after previously only allowing it one time back in 1975. It would also be famous for marking the third (and currently final) time that a #1 pick was selected directly out of high school. This year also saw players like LaMarcus Aldridge, Jermaine Bell, Ivan Chiriaev, and Maurice Shaw all initially declare entry for this year&#x27;s draft, but ultimately withdraw from it and decide to enter college instead. The following high school players successfully applied for early draft entrance.
* Jackie Butler – F, Coastal Christian Academy (Virginia Beach, Virginia)
* Dwight Howard – C, Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy (Atlanta, Georgia)
* Al Jefferson – F, Prentiss HS (Prentiss, Mississippi)
* Shaun Livingston – G, Peoria HS (Peoria, Illinois)
* J. R. Smith – G, St. Benedict&#x27;s Prep (Newark, New Jersey)
* Josh Smith – F, Oak Hill Academy (Mouth of Wilson, Virginia)
* Robert Swift – C, Bakersfield HS (Bakersfield, California)
* Dorell Wright – G/F, South Kent (South Kent, Connecticut)
===International players===
The following international players successfully applied for early draft entrance.

<doc id="751669" wikidata="Q1016410" url="?curid=751669" title="Burke's Peerage">
<text>Burke&#x27;s Peerage Limited is a British genealogical publisher, considered an authority on the order of precedence of noble families and information on the lesser nobility of the United Kingdom. It was founded in 1826, when the Anglo-Irish genealogist John Burke began releasing books devoted to the ancestry and heraldry of the peerage, baronetage, knightage and landed gentry of Great Britain and Ireland. His first publication, a &quot;Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the United Kingdom&quot;, was updated sporadically until 1847, when the company began publishing new editions every year as &quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage&quot; (often shortened and known as &quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage&quot;).

Other books followed, including &quot;Burke&#x27;s Landed Gentry&quot;, &quot;Burke&#x27;s Colonial Gentry&quot;, and &quot;Burke&#x27;s General Armory&quot;. In addition to its peerage publications, the &quot;Burke&#x27;s&quot; publishing company produced books on Royal families of Europe and Latin America, ruling families of Africa and the Middle East, distinguished families of the United States and historical families of Ireland.

==History==
The firm was established in 1826 by John Burke (1786–1848), progenitor of a dynasty of genealogists and heralds. His son Sir John Bernard Burke (1814–1892) was Ulster King of Arms (1853–1892) and his grandson, Sir Henry Farnham Burke (1859–1930), was Garter Principal King of Arms (1919–1930). After his death, ownership passed through a variety of people.

Apart from the Burke family, editors have included Arthur Charles Fox-Davies, Alfred Trego Butler, Leslie Gilbert Pine, Peter Townend, and Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd.

From 1974 to 1983, Jeremy Norman was chairman of the company, taking the role while Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd was editor. His fellow directors included Patrick, Lord Lichfield, and John Brooke-Little, Norroy &amp; Ulster King of Arms. Under Norman&#x27;s chairmanship, new volumes were published on royal families, Irish genealogy, and country houses of the British Isles. In 1984, the &quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage&quot; titles were separated and sold: &quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage&quot; itself was acquired by Frederik Jan Gustav Floris, Baron van Pallandt, while &quot;Burke&#x27;s Landed Gentry&quot; and other titles were sold to other buyers.

==Criticism==
In 1877, the Oxford professor Edward Augustus Freeman criticised the accuracy of &quot;Burke&#x27;s&quot; and said that it contained pedigrees that were purely mythical – if indeed mythical is not too respectable a name for what must be in many cases the work of deliberate invention [... and] all but invariably false. As a rule, it is not only false, but impossible [...] not merely fictions, but exactly that kind of fiction which is, in its beginning, deliberate and interested falsehood. Oscar Wilde in the play &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot; wrote: &quot;You should study the Peerage, Gerald. It is the one book a young man about town should know thoroughly, and it is the best thing in fiction the English have ever done!&quot; In 1901, the historian J. Horace Round wrote of Burke&#x27;s &quot;old fables&quot; and &quot;grotesquely impossible tales&quot;.

More recent editions have been more scrupulously checked and rewritten for accuracy, notably under the chief editorship, from 1949 to 1959, of L. G. Pine and Hugh Massingberd (1971–1983). Pine was particularly sceptical regarding many families&#x27; claims to antiquity, saying: &quot;If everybody who claims to have come over with the Conqueror were right, William must have landed with 200,000 men-at-arms instead of about 12,000.&quot;

<text>The fission-fragment rocket is a rocket engine design that directly harnesses hot nuclear fission products for thrust, as opposed to using a separate fluid as working mass. The design can, in theory, produce very high specific impulse while still being well within the abilities of current technologies.

== Design considerations ==

In traditional nuclear thermal rocket and related designs, the nuclear energy is generated in some form of reactor and used to heat a working fluid to generate thrust. This limits the designs to temperatures that allow the reactor to remain whole, although clever design can increase this critical temperature into the tens of thousands of degrees. A rocket engine&#x27;s efficiency is strongly related to the temperature of the exhausted working fluid, and in the case of the most advanced gas-core engines, it corresponds to a specific impulse of about 7000 s.

The temperature of a conventional reactor design is the average temperature of the fuel, the vast majority of which is not reacting at any given instant. The atoms undergoing fission are at a temperature of millions of degrees, which is then spread out into the surrounding fuel, resulting in an overall temperature of a few thousand.

By physically arranging the fuel into very thin layers or particles, the fragments of a nuclear reaction can escape from the surface. Since they will be ionized due to the high energy of the reaction, they can then be handled magnetically and channeled to produce thrust. Numerous technological challenges still remain, however.

== Research ==
===Rotating fuel reactor===
A design by the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory uses fuel placed on the surface of a number of very thin carbon fibres, arranged radially in wheels. The wheels are normally sub-critical. Several such wheels were stacked on a common shaft to produce a single large cylinder. The entire cylinder was rotated so that some fibres were always in a reactor core where surrounding moderator made fibres go critical. The fission fragments at the surface of the fibres would break free and be channeled for thrust. The fibre then rotates out of the reaction zone to cool, avoiding melting.

The efficiency of the system is surprising; specific impulses of greater than 100,000 s are possible using existing materials. This is high performance, although the weight of the reactor core and other elements would make the overall performance of the fission-fragment system lower. Nonetheless, the system provides the sort of performance levels that would make an interstellar precursor mission possible.

===Dusty plasma===
A newer design proposal by Rodney L. Clark and Robert B. Sheldon theoretically increases efficiency and decreases complexity of a fission fragment rocket at the same time over the rotating fibre wheel proposal. Their design uses nanoparticles of fissionable fuel (or even fuel that will naturally radioactively decay) of less than 100 nm diameter. The nanoparticles are kept in a vacuum chamber subject to an axial magnetic field (acting as a magnetic mirror) and an external electric field. As the nanoparticles ionize as fission occurs, the dust becomes suspended within the chamber. The incredibly high surface area of the particles makes radiative cooling simple. The axial magnetic field is too weak to affect the motions of the dust particles but strong enough to channel the fragments into a beam which can be decelerated for power, allowed to be emitted for thrust, or a combination of the two. 

With exhaust velocities of 3% - 5% the speed of light and efficiencies up to 90%, the rocket should be able to achieve an &quot;I&quot;sp of over 1,000,000 seconds. By further injecting the fission fragment exhaust with a neutral gas akin to an afterburner setup, the resulting heating and interaction can result in a higher, tunable thrust and specific impulse. For realistic designs, some calculations estimate thrusts on the range of 4.5 kN at around 32,000 seconds &quot;I&quot;sp, or even 40 kN at 5,000 seconds &quot;I&quot;sp.

===Am-242m as nuclear fuel===

In 1987, Ronen &amp; Leibson published a study on applications of Am (an isotope of americium) as nuclear fuel to space nuclear reactors, noting its extremely high thermal cross section and energy density. Nuclear systems powered by Am require less fuel by a factor of 2 to 100 compared to conventional nuclear fuels.

Fission-fragment rocket using Am was proposed by George Chapline at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 1988, who suggested propulsion based on the direct heating of a propellant gas by fission fragments generated by a fissile material. Ronen et al. demonstrate that Am can maintain sustained nuclear fission as an extremely thin metallic film, less than a micrometer thick. Am requires only 1% of the mass of U or Pu to reach its critical state. Ronen&#x27;s group at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev further showed that nuclear fuel based on Am could speed space vehicles from Earth to Mars in as little as two weeks.

Am&#x27;s potential as a nuclear fuel comes from the fact that it has the highest thermal fission cross section (thousands of barns), about 10x the next highest cross section across all known isotopes. Am is fissile and has a low critical mass, comparable to Pu. It has a very high cross section for fission, and is destroyed relatively quickly in a nuclear reactor. Another report claims that Am can sustain a chain reaction even as a thin film, and could be used for a novel type of nuclear rocket.

Since the thermal absorption cross section of Am is very high, the best way to obtain Am is by the capture of fast or epithermal neutrons in Americium-241 irradiated in a fast reactor. However, fast neutron reactors are not readily available. Detailed analysis of Am production in existing PWRs was provided in. Proliferation resistance of Am was reported by Karlsruhe Institute of Technology 2008 study.

In 2000, Carlo Rubbia at CERN further extended the work by Ronen and Chapline on fission-fragment rocket using Am as a fuel. Project 242 based on Rubbia design studied a concept of Am based Thin-Film Fission Fragment Heated NTR by using direct conversion of the kinetic energy of fission fragments into increasing of enthalpy of a propellant gas. Project 242 studied the application of this propulsion system to a crewed mission to Mars. Preliminary results were very satisfactory and it has been observed that a propulsion system with these characteristics could make the mission feasible. Another study focused on production of Am in conventional thermal nuclear reactors.

=== Aerogel core ===
On 9 January 2023, NASA announced funding the study of an &quot;Aerogel Core Fission Fragment Rocket Engine&quot;, where fissile fuel particles will be embedded in an ultra-low density aerogel matrix to achieve a critical mass assembly. The aerogel matrix (and a strong magnetic field) would allow fission fragments to escape the core, while increasing conductive and radiative heat loss from the individual fuel particles.

<text>Thomas Amory Deblois Fessenden (January 23, 1826 – September 28, 1868) was an American politician. He was a U.S. Representative from Maine.
==Biography==
Born in Portland, Maine, he attended North Yarmouth Academy and Dartmouth College and graduated from Bowdoin College in 1845. He then studied law and was admitted to the bar in April 1848. He established a practice in Mechanic Falls, Maine, and moved to Auburn, Maine in 1850, where he continuing working as an attorney.

He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1856 and 1868 and a member of the Maine House of Representatives in 1860 and 1868, as well as prosecuting attorney for Androscoggin County in 1861 and 1862.

He was elected as a Republican to the 37th Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Charles W. Walton and served from December 1, 1862, to March 3, 1863, and was not a candidate for renomination in 1862.

He returned to Maine and resumed the practice of law. He died in Auburn, and is interred in Evergreen Cemetery, Portland, Maine.

==Family==
He was the son of abolitionist legislator Samuel Fessenden, and brother of Treasury Secretary William P. Fessenden and congressman Samuel C. Fessenden. He was an uncle of Union Army generals Francis Fessenden and James D. Fessenden.

<text>The Street Lawyer is a legal thriller novel by John Grisham. It was Grisham&#x27;s ninth novel. The book was released in the United States on 1 January 1998, published by Bantam Books, and on 30 March 1998 in the UK, published by Century.

==Plot==
A homeless man, identifying himself only as &quot;Mister,&quot; enters the offices of the powerful Washington D.C. law firm Drake &amp; Sweeney and takes many of the lawyers hostage while angrily demanding information about some kind of eviction that took place. Although he is eventually shot and killed by a police sniper, one of the hostages, an antitrust lawyer named Michael Brock, is concerned by what he has learned and feels compelled to investigate further.

Brock finds his way to the 14th Street Legal Clinic, where he meets Mordecai Green, an advocate for the homeless. Green, along with his abrasive but brilliant staff, work to provide legal help to the most downtrodden members of society. Brock discovers that Drake &amp; Sweeney were involved in the sudden approval of a federal building project on the site of a condemned building that had been serving as rent-payment housing for formerly homeless families. These individuals were tenants and thus entitled to a full legal eviction/contestment process, but a senior Drake &amp; Sweeney partner ignored this information because the firm had a large stake in ensuring the federal project start on time, and thus illegally evicted the tenants in the middle of winter, resulting in the death of a homeless family. Brock takes a confidential file, intending to copy it, but is quickly suspected of its theft.

Shocked by what he has found, Brock leaves Drake &amp; Sweeney to take a poorly paid position with the 14th Street Legal Clinic, which works to protect the rights of the homeless. This leads to the severing of his links to his previous white collar life, as his already-dying marriage officially ends in an amicable divorce. Brock later becomes emotionally involved in the case of a woman named Ruby, whose drug addiction led to her losing custody of her son. He also meets a young homeless advocate named Megan and they start a relationship. As Drake &amp; Sweeney comes after Brock with theft and malpractice allegations, the clinic files a lawsuit against the firm and its business partners. The firm makes a deal where Brock has his license temporarily suspended, while they settle for a large amount of money and fire the partner whose actions led to the young family&#x27;s deaths.

Drake &amp; Sweeney&#x27;s head partner, deeply troubled by the events, offers to make his entire staff available for &quot;pro bono&quot; work to assist the clinic in fighting for the rights of homeless people. The book ends with Brock taking a short vacation with Megan and Ruby, and them reflecting on their lives.

==Reception==

The novel received generally positive reviews. Charles Spencer wrote in the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; that &quot;no one does it better than Grisham&quot;
and that the book is &quot;as unputdownable as ever&quot;. Mat Coward wrote in his review in The Independent that the novel is &quot;fluent and fascinating&quot; and mentioned &quot;Few writers have so much to say, the skills to make reading what they say an irresistible pleasure - and the clout to be able to be able to say it to an audience of millions&quot;.

Michiko Kakutani of the &quot;New York Times&quot; gave the novel a negative review, stating &quot;Grisham is too busy charging ahead to bother fleshing out any of these developments&quot; and describing the novel as &quot;a brand-name novel with an unlikable hero, a slapdash plot and some truly awful prose.&quot; It reached #1 on the New York Times bestsellers chart, maintaining the position for several weeks.

== Unsold television pilot ==

In 2003, plans were announced, and a television pilot filmed, for a proposed small screen adaptation of the novel. Produced by Touchstone Television, the show was to star Eddie Cibrian as Brock, KaDee Strickland, Mario Van Peebles and Hal Holbrook. Paris Barclay directed the pilot, which was scripted by Brian Koppelman and David Levien. For reasons that were never made public, the show was never given a full season pick-up.

<text>Woodstock is a fictional character in Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot;. He is a small yellow bird of unknown species and Snoopy&#x27;s best friend. The character first appeared in the March 4, 1966, strip, though he was not given a name until June 22, 1970. He is named after the Woodstock festival of 1969.

==History==
Snoopy wordlessly interacted with an unnamed bird, using only punctuation and musical notes, as early as 1951. In the early 1960s, Snoopy began befriending birds when they started using his doghouse for various purposes: a rest stop during migrations, a nesting site, a community hall, or a place to play cards. None of these birds were ever given a name, although they did, on occasion (e.g., July 10, 1962), use speech balloons, lettered in what would become the classic &#x27;chicken scratch marks&#x27; of Woodstock&#x27;s utterances. What set Woodstock apart from all these earlier birds was the fact that he attached himself to Snoopy and assumed the role of Snoopy&#x27;s sidekick and assistant. There had been no recurring relationships between Snoopy and the earlier birds who visited the yard of the Browns, and Snoopy was more often than not more hostile than friendly toward those birds.

In the &quot;Peanuts&quot; daily comic strip on March 3, 1966, a mother bird flew in while Snoopy was lying on top of his doghouse, nested on top of his stomach and flew away. Soon afterward two chicks hatched in the nest, one of which hung around Snoopy throughout the spring, and returned the following spring on April 4, 1967. Schulz began to establish character traits for Snoopy&#x27;s new friend by revealing that he could talk (or at least emote), that he didn&#x27;t like flying south every winter, and that he struggled with flying. By the end of this four-strip sequence, Snoopy, in character as the World War I Flying Ace, learns that the bird is his new mechanic, Woodstock&#x27;s first supporting role.

After this introduction, the unnamed Woodstock is seen with Snoopy on occasion, and other birds continue to appear as they had for years. But Woodstock is singled out as the bird who befriended Snoopy, in part by continuing references to him as the Flying Ace&#x27;s mechanic (July 12, 1967; June 12–14, 1968). On June 14, 1968, 14 months after his first landing on Snoopy and after a second appearance as a supporting character for Snoopy (his wrist wrestling partner on April 25, 1968), the most important aspect of Woodstock&#x27;s relationship with Snoopy is made clear: Snoopy first refers to this bird as his buddy. This identification was more than enough for readers to know if they hadn&#x27;t already figured it out, that this little bird, name or no name, had assumed the role of a regular character in the &quot;Peanuts&quot; cast.

Schulz did not give him a name until June 22, 1970. Schulz acknowledged in several print and TV interviews in the mid-1970s that he took Woodstock&#x27;s name from the rock festival. (The festival&#x27;s logo shows a bird perched on a guitar.)

==Character==
Woodstock is a bird who is Snoopy&#x27;s best friend. The only non-bird character who can understand Woodstock&#x27;s speech is Snoopy. When depicted in the comic strip, his speech is rendered almost entirely in &quot;chicken scratch&quot; marks, with Snoopy&#x27;s either directly translating or allowing the reader to deduce Woodstock&#x27;s meaning in the context of Snoopy&#x27;s replies. Woodstock does make nonverbal noises such as yawns, laughter, sighs and &quot;Z&quot;s or snores to indicate sleep. He also uses punctuation marks like &quot;!&quot; or &quot;??&quot; to indicate emotions. In the movies and television specials, the chicken scratches are rendered audibly as a staccato series of high-pitched honks and squawks by Snoopy&#x27;s voice actor Bill Melendez. Woodstock often works as Snoopy&#x27;s secretary (most notably when the latter was appointed &quot;Head Beagle&quot;), and caddies for him when he plays golf (usually with some difficulty). Woodstock also plays American football with Snoopy, usually attempting to catch the ball but, due to his size, he is simply hit by it; sometimes getting embedded into the ground a short distance.

Woodstock is a small and good-hearted yellow bird. He resourcefully wins the river rafting race in &quot;Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown&quot; after all other contestants have been eliminated. He routinely takes Snoopy&#x27;s gentle verbal digs and practical jokes in stride, though he does not hesitate to stand up to Snoopy if his friend goes too far. Once, he and Snoopy stopped speaking to each other because of Snoopy&#x27;s practice of reading &quot;War and Peace&quot; one word per day. When told that Woodstock was being attacked by the cat next door, Snoopy immediately rushed to his aid, getting clobbered in the process (what the cat was attacking ended up being a yellow glove). He also hates being mistaken for the wrong species of bird (though we are never told what species he actually is), and he is reluctant to eat thrown bread crumbs because he doesn&#x27;t want anyone to think he&#x27;s on welfare, and when asked about his net income by Snoopy in his &#x27;census-taker&#x27; persona, he replied &quot;four worms a day&quot;. He&#x27;s a whiz at playing trivia too, and almost always manages to stump Snoopy.

Woodstock is also a skilled whistler. In the TV special, &quot;She&#x27;s a Good Skate, Charlie Brown&quot;, when Peppermint Patty&#x27;s music for a skating competition fails to play due to a malfunction that cannot be repaired expediently, Woodstock steps up to the microphone and whistles a flawless &quot;O Mio Babbino Caro&quot;, to which Peppermint Patty performs her routine. He also whistles his part in the song &quot;The Best of Buddies&quot; (via an instrumental version entitled &quot;Woodstock&#x27;s Samba&quot;) in the feature film &quot;Snoopy Come Home&quot;.

For all of Woodstock&#x27;s acumen and talent, he is physically a very poor flyer, which has been a character trait since he first appeared. He flutters around erratically, often upside down, and frequently crashes into things. He usually manages to get where he wants to go as long as he doesn&#x27;t have to fly too high. He is prone to beak-bleeds if he goes over 10 feet in the air. Despite his difficulty in flying like a bird, he is skilled in piloting Snoopy as a canine helicopter. When asked where he learned to pilot, Woodstock replied (speaking in his usual chicken scratches, but translated), &quot;Nam.&quot; This gag appeared in the strip several times as well as in &quot;It&#x27;s Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown&quot;.

During the winter, he relaxes by either skating or playing ice hockey on top of the birdbath, complete with his own Zamboni machine to keep the surface clean (except one year where Woodstock asks Snoopy to migrate with him, and the duo takes the trip on foot). His one goal throughout the comic is to track down his mother so he can send her a Mother&#x27;s Day card.

In the TV special, &quot;It&#x27;s the Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown&quot;, Snoopy buys Woodstock a birdhouse to replace his nest after a cold early spring rain. At first, Woodstock refused to use it, so Snoopy forced the issue. Checking up later on Woodstock, Snoopy peers into the birdhouse to find Woodstock has converted it into a 1970s-style leisure room (complete with a quadraphonic stereo system) that appears much larger on the inside than from outside (much like Snoopy&#x27;s doghouse). Unfortunately, Snoopy gets his nose stuck in the door and demolishes the house, so he buys Woodstock a second birdhouse, which Woodstock accepts.

Woodstock and his fellow yellow birds (named Bill, Harriet, Olivier, Raymond, Fred, Roy, Wilson and Conrad) often join Snoopy for group activities, with Snoopy as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader. Most frequently, they embark on Beagle Scout expeditions with Snoopy as scoutmaster, or as a patrol of the French Foreign Legion on their march for Fort Zinderneuf, led by Snoopy as their sergeant. They also have formed football and ice hockey teams (on one occasion a football team composed of Snoopy and the birds defeated a human football team led by Peppermint Patty). The birds and Snoopy occasionally are shown playing bridge. Although all but Raymond (who is purple) and Harriet (with a red ribbon) look alike, Snoopy seems to be able to tell them apart.

An important and recurring characteristic of Woodstock is his absurdly and hilariously high physical strength and endurance, considering he couldn&#x27;t weigh more than about 50 grams. When playing hockey against Snoopy on his &quot;home ice&quot; (a frozen birdbath), he administers the beagle a severe body check that sends Snoopy flying clear out of the birdbath. In another instance, Woodstock discovers a &quot;strange creature&quot; in his nest. Linus wants to investigate the nest and asks Snoopy to &quot;give him a boost&quot; so he can reach the tree&#x27;s lowest branch, which Snoopy does. The branch being still out of Linus&#x27;s reach, Woodstock gives Snoopy and Linus both a boost, holding them in the air at wings&#x27; length, finally allowing Linus to climb the tree. Another strip has Snoopy once again try to determine what species Woodstock belongs to. Snoopy theorizes Woodstock might be an eagle. Since Snoopy has heard somewhere that eagles are capable of lifting a small child, he suggests Woodstock try that with Linus. The bird successfully lifts Linus with his wings three inches in the air and holds him up. The last instance is when Snoopy, posing as a football coach, is angry at his player Woodstock for losing &quot;the book with all our secret plays&quot; and orders the bird to run twenty thousand laps around the field as punishment. Woodstock fearfully complies.

Woodstock wears a watch on his right wing? in &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot; (at time point 15:02) and in 2021&#x27;s &quot;The Snoopy Show&quot; (episode 2 &quot;Nest Friends&quot;, episode 5 &quot;Happy Bird-Day&quot;).

The TV special &quot;It&#x27;s a Mystery, Charlie Brown&quot; was mainly centered around Woodstock. The entire cold open and first act of the special involves Woodstock building his nest and taking a bird bath, and getting caught in a rainstorm, which, to Woodstock, is like a typhoon. The special centers around the theft of his nest and Snoopy, dressed as the World Famous Detective, trying to find out who did it.

Both Snoopy and Woodstock were voiced by Bill Melendez from 1972 to 2006.

==Development==
Schulz explained in a 1982 interview:

Despite this, Woodstock was referred to as a male as early as the strip from June 12, 1968.

In the Norwegian translation of &quot;Peanuts&quot;, the bird is named &quot;Fredrikke&quot;—a female name—and is always referred to as female. Finnish translation uses the name &quot;Kaustinen&quot;, without a specified gender and Spanish translations use the name &quot;Emilio&quot;—a male name.

==Species==
At one point Snoopy attempts to identify what type of bird Woodstock is with the aid of a field guide, asking Woodstock to attempt to imitate various birds: American bittern, Carolina wren, rufous-sided towhee, yellow-billed cuckoo, Canada goose, warbler, and mourning warbler. Snoopy finally gives up trying to figure it out, and says, &quot;For all I know, you&#x27;re a duck!&quot; Woodstock then cries and Snoopy hugs him and apologizes.

Despite being a bird, Woodstock is a very poor flyer. It may be because of his small wings, or may be because, due to his mother abandoning him, Snoopy had to teach him to fly. He flitters around in erratic fashion, often upside down, and frequently crashes into things. 
Woodstock&#x27;s bird friends are the same species, so they are all bad flyers. Once, Woodstock and his bird friends wanted to go hiking to the summit of &quot;Point Lobos&quot;. Lucy laughs at them and says that they are stupid because they are birds and can just fly.

==Awards and honors==
Schulz was a keen bridge player, and &quot;Peanuts&quot; occasionally included bridge references. In 1997 the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL), awarded both Snoopy and Woodstock the honorary rank of Life Master, and Schulz was delighted.

In education, emphasis is often placed on how the Idea articulates education&#x27;s role for Wisconsin&#x27;s government and inhabitants. In politics, the Idea is most associated with the historic political upheaval and subsequent reformation during the Progressive Era in the United States.

First articulated in the educational sense in 1904 when University of Wisconsin-Madison President Charles Van Hise declared he would &quot;never be content until the beneficent influence of the university reaches every family in the state&quot;, the Wisconsin Idea has been used to frame and foster the public universities contributions to the state of Wisconsin&#x27;s government and citizens: &quot;to the government in the forms of serving in office, offering advice about public policy, providing information and exercising technical skill, and to the citizens in the forms of doing research directed at solving problems that are important to the state and conducting outreach activities&quot;.

In the strictly political sense, the Idea came about during the Progressive Era when proponents of the Wisconsin Idea took inspiration from traditions and customs brought to the state by German Americans. These progressives saw U.S. states as &quot;laboratories for democracy&quot; ready for experimentation. This resulted in a genitive legislative environment that implemented numerous significant reforms including to primary elections, workers&#x27; compensation, state and federal transportation, U.S. Senate elections, and progressive taxation that served as a model for other states and the federal government. The modern political facet of the philosophy is the effort &quot;to ensure well-constructed legislation aimed at benefiting the greatest number of people&quot;.

==In education==

For more than a century, the university system has been guided by the &quot;Wisconsin Idea&quot;, a tradition first enunciated by the University of Wisconsin President Charles Van Hise in 1904. Van Hise declared that he would &quot;never be content until the beneficent influence of the university reaches every family in the state&quot;.

The &quot;Wisconsin Idea&quot; is a philosophy embraced by the University of Wisconsin System (UW System) that holds that university research should be applied to solve problems and improve health, quality of life, the environment, and agriculture for all citizens of the state. As explained by Adlai Stevenson II, &quot;the Wisconsin tradition meant more than a simple belief in the people. It also meant faith in the application of intelligence and reason to the problems of society. It meant a deep conviction that the role of government was not to stumble along like a drunkard in the dark, but to light its way by the best torches of knowledge and understanding it could find.&quot;

This Progressive-era policy applied the expertise of the state&#x27;s university to social legislation that benefited all the state&#x27;s citizens; it led to classic programs such as regulation of utilities, workers&#x27; compensation, tax reform, and university extension services; sometimes expressed in the maxim that &quot;the boundaries of the campus are the boundaries of the state&quot;. Over time, for the UW System, the Wisconsin Idea has come to signify more broadly the university’s commitment to public service — a mission that substantially predates the progressive political era.

=== Formation of the Wisconsin Idea at Madison ===

While the University of Wisconsin was established in Madison on July 26, 1848, the Wisconsin Idea was not mentioned in the original charter. The idea laid latent for around 50 years until the Progressive Era when the state gained national attention for its innovative economic and political reforms. Amidst this ferment, the original “Wisconsin Idea” was popularized—the idea that a public university should improve the lives of people beyond the borders of its campus. It is in this spirit that Governor Robert M. La Follette routinely consulted with University of Wisconsin researchers to devise groundbreaking programs and legislation. Although the Wisconsin Idea is often attributed to the famed 1904 speech by Charles Van Hise, president of the University of Wisconsin, many university leaders and faculty have been credited with helping formulate the Idea.

David Hoeveler, who holds a distinguished professorship in history at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, argues the Idea originated decades earlier, in the creative and fertile mind of John Bascom. A philosopher, theologian, and sociologist, Bascom deeply influenced a generation of students at the University of Wisconsin, including La Follette and Van Hise. Bascom drew concepts from German idealism, liberal Protestantism, and evolutionary theory, transforming them into advocacy for social and political reform. He was a champion of temperance, women’s rights, and labor, all of which brought him controversy as president of the university from 1874 to 1887. In a way unmatched by any leader of a major American university in his time, Bascom outlined a social gospel that called for an expanded role for state governments and universities as agencies of moral improvement.

Additionally, the Ideas&#x27; intellectual history can be traced from the nineteenth century to the influential Progressive Era thinkers John R. Commons and Richard T. Ely, who believed university researchers should be a vital source of expertise for government and citizens. John Commons has even been credited with originating the Wisconsin Idea by the Madison Landmarks Commission.

Finally, the activities and concepts that make up the &quot;Wisconsin Idea&quot; were not formally announced as such until 1912 when Charles McCarthy described the philosophy in a book by that name. According to historian Tim Lacy, McCarthy, &quot;possessed an extraordinary sense of political philosophy and contextual factors; this sense broadly shaped the Wisconsin Idea. He was sensitive to ethics, the problems of force, the distoring effects of money and capitalism, the wants of everyday people, the importance of deliberation, the problems of expertise, the drive for efficiency, and the concerns of justice.&quot; By that time, Wisconsin had developed a national reputation for legislative innovation.

=== Creation of the University of Wisconsin System ===
Originally the UW System schools outside Madison were State Normal Schools, created for teacher preparation. These became State Teachers Colleges in the 1920s, then State Colleges in the 1950s. In 1956 the Milwaukee State College was incorporated with the University of Wisconsin, which at the time only included the Madison Campus. The other 4 year Universities (Platteville, Whitewater, Oshkosh, River Falls, Stout (in Menomonie), Superior, Stevens Point, La Crosse, and Eau Claire) grew in size rapidly, added graduate programs, and in 1964 became Wisconsin State Universities. The University of Wisconsin built two new universities, at Green Bay and Kenosha (Parkside). In 1971 there was increasing pressure for the Universities in the State to confederate into one system. With the insistence of State Governor Patrick Lucey the Wisconsin State Universities and the UW were unified, preserving each campus&#x27;s individual focuses and strengths while providing the support and prestige of UW Madison. The new UW System mission statement reads:

“The mission of the system is to develop human resources, to discover and disseminate knowledge, to extend knowledge and its application beyond the boundaries of its campuses and to serve and stimulate society by developing in students heightened intellectual, cultural and humane sensitivities, scientific, professional and technological expertise and a sense of purpose. Inherent in this broad mission are methods of instruction, research, extended training and public service designed to educate people and improve the human condition. Basic to every purpose of the system is the search for truth.”

=== Challenges to the Wisconsin Idea as part of the UW System ===

In 2015, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker&#x27;s budget proposal included the removal of the Wisconsin Idea from the University of Wisconsin System mission statement. Walker proposed replacing the mission&#x27;s goal to &quot;extend knowledge and its application beyond the boundaries of its campus&quot; and to &quot;serve and stimulate society&quot; with a goal &quot;to meet the state&#x27;s workforce needs&quot;. After a negative reaction from politicians and the public, the Wisconsin Idea was restored to the budget proposal.

Following the attempted removal of the Wisconsin Idea and in response to broader political trends at the time, the University of Wisconsin-Madison along with former Sociology staff member Patrick Brenzel created the course and public lecture series “Forward? The Wisconsin Idea, Past &amp; Present” in 2015. When Brenzel conceived of the course, he had hoped it could “reinvigorate a broader, multidisciplinary conversation about how we (UW faculty), within our specialties, can re-engage with the people of Wisconsin.” First facilitated by Chad Alan Goldberg in 2016, the course has had various professors guide the course since its creation. With over 70 guest lecturers having presented on topics ranging from public health to limnology, the course aims to identify challenges to the promise of the Wisconsin Idea in the 21st century.

==In politics==
The &quot;Wisconsin Idea&quot;, in American history, also refers to a series of political reforms of the late 19th century and early 20th century whose strongest advocate was Robert M. La Follette, Sr., Wisconsin&#x27;s governor (1901–1906) and senator (1906–1925). The Wisconsin Idea was created by the state&#x27;s progressives to do away with monopolies, trusts, high cost of living, and predatory wealth, which they saw as the problem that must be solved or else &quot;no advancement of human welfare or progress can take place&quot;. Reforms in labor rights were one of the major aspects of the Wisconsin Idea. The progressive worker&#x27;s compensation program was first introduced by German immigrants, who were abundant in Wisconsin. The system was adopted from the existing system in Germany, which was based on the idea that the employer was obligated to take care of his employees and keep paying them as they grew old. Many of the reforms were based on traditions and customs brought to the state by German immigrants. The emphasis on higher learning and well-funded universities stressed by the Wisconsin Idea was derived from the education system of Germany. Progressives also proposed the first state income taxes, as well as submitting the idea of a progressive tax. They also passed legislation prohibiting pollution and police brutality.

The Wisconsin Idea would go on to set an example for other states in the United States. The progressive politicians of the time sought to emulate and ultimately transcend the states of the east coast in regards to labor laws. Wisconsin progressives wished to make Wisconsin into a benchmark for other Midwestern states to strive towards. Although many of the reforms went through in 1911, conservative opponents of the progressive party took control of Wisconsin in 1914, thus minimizing the magnitude and effects of the reforms. The Wisconsin Idea would continue to be a revolutionary precedent for other universities, and its educational aspects are still relevant today. Robert La Follette, Sr. was the man who implemented much of this legislation, and he was among the earliest supporters of direct election of senators, which is now a national practice. These progressive politicians also helped pass the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Amendments to the American Constitution.

These proposed reforms, all of which were eventually adopted, included:
* Primary elections, allowing the rank-and-file members of a political party to choose its nominees rather than caucuses usually dominated by political bosses.
* Workers&#x27; compensation, allowing workers injured whilst working to receive a fixed payment in compensation for their injuries and related expenses rather than forcing them to go to court against their employers, which at the time was extremely difficult and had little realistic chance of success.
* State regulation of railroads in addition to the federal regulation imposed by the Interstate Commerce Commission.
* Direct election of United States Senators as opposed to the original method of their selection by the state legislatures, eventually ratified as the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
* Progressive taxation, where the wealthier pay a higher rate of tax than the less-affluent, made possible on the federal level in part by the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Adoption of these reforms marked the high point of the Progressive Era.

== Relationship with indigenous culture ==
The University of Wisconsin-Madison resides in the region called &quot;Teejop,&quot; or the Four Lakes, the ancestral land of the Ho-Chunk Nation, and thus the Wisconsin Idea is inherently tied to the history, people, and land. The University of Wisconsin was established in 1848 and became a land-grant institution in 1866 by virtue of the Morrill Act. Land Grants allowed federal lands to the states to be “for the use and support of a University within said Territory, and for no other use or purpose whatsoever.” The establishment and expansion of the University necessitated taking land from the Ho-Chunk Nation; displacing them from their ancestral land.

This legacy of manifest destiny continues throughout the course of the University. Charles McCarthy, a famous proponent of the Wisconsin Idea, wrote “To the hard-handed men who broke the prairie, hewed the forests, made the roads and bridges and built little homes in the wilderness...and all the toilers who, by their sweat, made possible our schools, a great university, and all the good that is with us.”

The Wisconsin Idea values diverse and holistic learning, of which Native perspectives and knowledge systems have long been ignored. In the early nineties, there were calls for reform in how schools taught US history. In recent years, the University of Wisconsin-Madison administration has taken some steps to better address the Indigenous history of the campus land as well as incorporate Indigenous knowledge systems into the curriculum. This is in light of a broader move by the state of Wisconsin, which established the American Indian Curriculum Services in the Wisconsin Act 31 in 1991.

In 2015, the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies as the University of Wisconsin-Madison convened a leadership summit with representatives from the twelve Native Nations in Wisconsin, leading to the creation of the Native Nations_UW (NN_UW) Working Group.

This initiative is a partnership between UW-Madison, University of Wisconsin Colleges, and University of Wisconsin Extension and the Native Nations in Wisconsin, founded on the strategic plan to work towards more respectful and reciprocal partnerships. UW-Madison created a full-time position of tribal relations director in 2019, naming Aaron Bird Bear the first to hold this position intended to foster stronger ties between the 12 First Nations of Wisconsin and the university.

In 2019, a new heritage marker titled &quot;Our Shared Future&quot; was developed in collaboration with representatives of the Ho-Chunk Nation and placed on Bascom Hill, recognizing the land as the ancestral home of the Ho-Chunk, acknowledging the circumstances that led to their forced removal, and honoring the Ho-Chunk Nation&#x27;s history of resistance and resilience. In 2020, UW-Madison was awarded a grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture as part of the Wisconsin Land-Grant System Partnership for the Advancing Native Education Pathways project. This project seeks to engage members of Wisconsin’s Tribal Nations; university faculty, staff, and students; and community members to integrate Indigenous knowledge and methods.

In announcement of this grant, Kristen Levan, a Strategic Communications Specialist at the University, writes, &quot;In spirit of the Wisconsin Idea, UW-Madison&#x27;s belief that education must enhance people&#x27;s lives beyond the boundaries of the classroom, supporting Native American educational achievement aligns with the university&#x27;s commitment to public service.&quot;

==In media==

Wisconsin Public Radio, formerly a division of the University of Wisconsin-Extension, was established to bring the Wisconsin Idea to the broadcast airwaves. From the WPR Mission Statement: &quot;WPR&#x27;s Mission is to realize the Wisconsin Idea by producing, acquiring and delivering high quality audio programming that serves the public&#x27;s need to discuss ideas and opinions, and that provides cultural enrichment, intellectual stimulation, and intelligent, enlightening entertainment.&quot;

<text>Household final consumption expenditure (POES) is a transaction of the national account&#x27;s use of income account representing consumer spending. It consists of the expenditure incurred by resident households on individual consumption goods and services, including those sold at prices that are not economically significant. It also includes various kinds of imputed expenditure of which the imputed rent for services of owner-occupied housing (imputed rents) is generally the most important one. The household sector covers not only those living in traditional households, but also those people living in communal establishments, such as retirement homes, boarding houses and prisons.

The above given definition of HFCE includes expenditure by resident households on the domestic territory and expenditure by resident households abroad (outbound tourists), but excludes any non-resident households&#x27; expenditure on the domestic territory (inbound tourists). From this national definition of consumption expenditure may be distinguished the household final consumption expenditure according to the domestic concept which includes household expenditure made on the domestic territory by residents and inbound tourists, but excludes residents&#x27; expenditure made abroad.

HFCE is measured at purchasers&#x27; prices which is the price the purchaser actually pays at the time of the purchase. It includes non-deductible value added tax and other taxes on products, transport and marketing costs and tips paid over and above stated prices.

==Components==

Household final consumption expenditure includes the following components:
* households&#x27; purchases of products for their everyday needs (&quot;e.g. food, clothing, cars, rents, personal services)&quot;
* households&#x27; partial payments for products provided by the general government (&quot;e.g. tickets to public museums and swimming pools)&quot;
* households&#x27; payments to the general government for licences and permits &quot;(e.g. fees for issuing passports)&quot;
* imputed rents for services of owner-occupied housing
* household&#x27;s own account consumption of outputs produced by unincorporated enterprises owned by households &quot;(e.g. own-consumption of milk produced on a farm)&quot;
* income in kind earned by employees &quot;(free or reduced train tickets for railway employees)&quot;
* households&#x27; consumption of Financial Intermediation Services Indirectly Measured (FISIM)

==From household final consumption expenditure to actual final consumption of households==

Household final consumption expenditure (HFCE) is not an exhaustive measure of the goods and services consumed by households. The general government and non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH) often provide goods and services to households for their individual consumption free of charge or at reduced prices. Examples are health services provided by governments or reimbursed by a social security fund, education services, the part of service provided by public museums, concert halls, operas, swimming pools that is not financed by entrance fees, aid for social housing etc. By adding the general government&#x27;s and NPISHs&#x27; individual consumption expenditure to household final consumption expenditure one receives the actual final consumption of households.

Actual final consumption of households excludes the general government&#x27;s collective consumption expenditure which is expenditure on goods and services that cannot be uniquely attributed to households (e.g. expenditure on defence, safety and order, home affairs, environmental protection, national bodies such as parliament, governments etc.).

==Data==

In the member states of the European Union the share of household final consumption expenditure (HFCE) in actual final consumption of households usually varies between 70% and 90%. The rest is goods and services consumed free of charge (or at reduced prices) transferred by governments and non-profit institutions serving households to households. A high government share in the provision of individual consumption goods and services is often found in countries known as welfare states. Countries with relatively large shares of such transfers in kind are Belgium, Denmark, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden, where HFCE represents less than 80% of actual final consumption of households for most years.
The above observations are based on data downloadable from Eurostat&#x27;s website:
*Household final consumption expenditure per inhabitant in the EU Member States and Japan
*Actual individual consumption per inhabitant in European countries

<doc id="751686" wikidata="Q7994876" url="?curid=751686" title="White House FBI files controversy">
<text>The White House FBI files controversy of the Clinton Administration, often referred to as Filegate, arose in June 1996 around improper access in 1993 and 1994 to FBI security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, director of the White House&#x27;s Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background reports concerning several hundred individuals without asking permission. The revelations provoked a strong political and press reaction because many of the files covered White House employees from previous Republican administrations, including top presidential advisors. Under criticism, Livingstone resigned from his position. Allegations were made that senior White House figures, including First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, may have requested and read the files for political purposes, and that the First Lady had authorized the hiring of the underqualified Livingstone.

The matter was investigated by the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Whitewater Independent Counsel. In 1998, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr exonerated President Bill Clinton as well as the First Lady of any involvement in the matter. In 2000, Independent Counsel Robert Ray issued his final report on Filegate, stating that there was no credible evidence of any criminal activity by any individual in the matter and no credible evidence that senior White House figures or the First Lady had requested the files or had acted improperly or testified improperly regarding Livingstone&#x27;s hiring. A separate lawsuit on the matter brought by Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, lingered on for years and was dismissed by a federal judge in 2010.

==Improper use of files issue==
&quot;Filegate&quot; began on June 5, 1996, when Republican Pennsylvania Congressman William F. Clinger, Jr., chair of the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, announced that the committee had found, during their ongoing &quot;Travelgate&quot; investigations, that FBI background reports on Travelgate figure Billy Dale had been delivered to the White House. The following day, the White House delivered to the committee hundreds of other such files related to White House employees of the Reagan Administration and George H. W. Bush Administration, for which Craig Livingstone, director of the White House&#x27;s Office of Personnel Security, had improperly requested and received background reports from the FBI in 1993 and 1994, without asking permission of the subject individuals.
Estimates ranged from 400 to 700 to 900 unauthorized file disclosures. The incident caused an intense burst of criticism because many of the files covered White House employees from previous Republican administrations, including top figures such as James Baker, Brent Scowcroft, and Marlin Fitzwater.

Initial White House explanations for what had happened varied, but generally characterized it as a series of mistakes made without bad intent and offered apologies to those affected. President Clinton said that, &quot;It appears to have been a completely honest bureaucratic snafu.&quot; However, his Republican opponent in the ongoing 1996 presidential election, Senator Bob Dole, compared it to the enemies list kept by the Nixon administration. Republicans made other charges, including that the White House was trying to dig up damaging information about Republicans in general and that the file transfer was motivated by a desire to slander Dale and other White House Travel Office officials in order to justify their dismissal.

On June 18, 1996, Attorney General Janet Reno asked the FBI to look into it; FBI Director Louis Freeh acknowledged that both the FBI and especially the White House had committed &quot;egregious violations of privacy&quot; (in some cases the background reports contained information about extramarital affairs, trangressions with the law, and medical issues). On June 21 Reno decided it was a conflict of interest for the U.S. Department of Justice to further investigate the matter, and thus recommended that it be folded into the overall umbrella of the Whitewater investigations, under charge of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. In any case, Starr had already begun looking into it.
On June 26, 1996, Clinger&#x27;s Government Reform and Oversight Committee held hearings on the matter. Livingstone, who announced his resignation at the start of his testimony that day, and his assistant, Anthony Marceca, insisted during the committee&#x27;s hearings that the mishandled files were a result of a bureaucratic mixup and that no improper motivations were behind it. They said that when the George H. W. Bush administrative staff left the White House in January 1993, they had taken all the files of the Office of Personnel Security with them for use in the Bush Library, as they were permitted to do under law. The OPS staff were trying to rebuild these records to include those of permanent White House employees who remained to work in the Clinton administration; Marceca, a civilian investigator for the Army, had been hired for this task. In doing so, they received an outdated list from the Secret Service of White House employees, which included many names who were no longer employees. This list was then given to the FBI and the personnel background files returned as a result. Lisa Wetzl, another assistant, testified that she discovered the mistake in mid-1994 and destroyed the request list.

Also called to testify were former White House counsel Bernard Nussbaum and former associate counsel William H. Kennedy III. Livingstone, Nussbaum, and Kennedy all offered apologies to those whose files had been obtained. On September 24, 1996, the Government Reform and Oversight Committee approved, on party lines, an interim report on the affair, blasting the Clinton Administration for a &quot;cavalier approach&quot; towards sensitive security procedures and saying that further investigation was necessary to determine if the events surrounding the files handling were &quot;a blunder, the result of colossal incompetence, or whether they are established to be more serious or even criminal.&quot; The Committee does not seem to have ever issued a final report.

The Senate Judiciary Committee was also involved in investigating the matter, holding hearings beginning June 29, 1996, and focussing on allegations that White House was engaged in a &quot;dirty tricks&quot; operation reminiscent of the Nixon administration. Looking into accusations that senior White House officials or the First Lady may have inappropriately perused the files, in October 1996, Republican committee chair Orrin Hatch requested that the FBI do a fingerprint analysis of them. On November 3, 1996, the FBI informed the committee that no fingerprints of either the First Lady or any other named senior official were on the files.

==Who hired Livingstone issue==
A secondary question of the Filegate controversy revolved around what the Office of Personnel Security was, who had authorized the hiring of Livingstone, and whether he was qualified for the job. The Office was not responsible for actual White House security, as that was the charge of the United States Secret Service, nor did it perform background checks on potential White House employees, a task done by the FBI, nor did it keep the regular personnel files of employees, which were held in a different office within the White House. Rather, its role was to keep track of who was employed by the White House, make sure their security clearances were up to date, and give security briefings to new hires. 

Nevertheless, Livingstone seemed to lack qualifications for even this position; he had worked on a number of Democratic Party campaigns and transitions, including being an advance man for the Clinton-Gore 1992 campaign, and his only prior job in the &quot;security&quot; field was that of a local bar bouncer at a Washington, D.C., night club. (At the congressional hearings, Livingstone objected to &quot;false and unfair caricatures of who I am. [...] I have worked hard for little or no pay in political campaigns for candidates who I felt would make this country a better place to live.&quot;) Initially, White House officials could not explain why Livingstone was hired, nor who had hired him. After a week of uncertainty, Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos told ABC News that White House deputy counsel Vince Foster had initially hired Livingstone on a temporary basis, and that after Foster&#x27;s death, associate counsel Kennedy had taken Livingstone on.

An FBI document suggested that Livingstone had been given his position because First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was a friend of Livingstone&#x27;s mother and recommended him. Hillary Clinton stated that while she was once photographed with the mother in a large group, she did not know her. Hillary Clinton was briefly deposed at the White House by the Independent Counsel regarding this matter on January 14, 1998. (That same day, the same Office of the Independent Counsel staff were listening to taped conversations of Linda Tripp and Monica Lewinsky; the Lewinsky scandal was soon to break.) In 1999, Clinton gave a sworn statement that she had nothing to do with Livingstone&#x27;s hiring. Livingstone also stated under oath there was no truth to the supposed hiring relationship. Hillary Clinton would later refer to the whole files matter as a &quot;pseudoscandal&quot;.

==Official findings==
On November 19, 1998, Independent Counsel Starr testified before the House Judiciary Committee in connection with the Impeachment of Bill Clinton over charges related to the Lewinsky scandal. Here, for the first time, Starr exonerated both President Clinton and the First Lady of complicity in the FBI files matter, saying &quot;while there are outstanding issues that we are attempting to resolve with respect to one individual [we] found no evidence that anyone higher [than Livingstone or Marceca] was in any way involved in ordering the files from the FBI. Second, we have found no evidence that information contained in the files of former officials was used for an improper purpose.&quot; (Starr also chose this occasion to clear President Clinton in the Travelgate matter, and to say that he had not committed impeachable wrongdoing in the Whitewater matter; Democrats on the committee immediately criticized Starr for withholding all these findings until after the 1998 Congressional elections.)

In March 2000, Independent Counsel Robert Ray, Starr&#x27;s successor, issued the office&#x27;s final report on the matter, as part of a concerted effort to wrap up all Whitewater-related cases before the end of Bill Clinton&#x27;s term. Ray determined that there was no credible evidence of any criminal activity by any individual in the matter. It attributed the improper collection of the files by Marceca due to his having an outdated Secret Service list of White House passes, as Marceca had originally claimed. It stated that even though Marceca&#x27;s statements were sometimes &quot;contradictory and misleading&quot;, they were &quot;sufficiently transparent&quot; and there was insufficient evidence to prove that Anthony Marceca had made false statements to Congress during his testimony. The report ascribed the FBI files matter to &quot;a failure of process at many levels,&quot; saying that the Secret Service had provided critically erroneous data, and that this was compounded by the White House&#x27;s informal process of requesting sensitive information by &quot;inexperienced, untrained, and unsupervised personnel with backgrounds as political operatives.&quot;

Based on an investigation that included the prior fingerprint analysis, the report further stated that:

Ray&#x27;s report also concluded that there was no credible evidence that Bernard Nussbaum testified falsely about not having discussed Livingstone&#x27;s hiring with the First Lady, and found as well that there was no personal relationship between the First Lady and Livingstone that had formed the basis for his hiring.

==Judicial Watch lawsuit==
Separately from the Independent Counsel investigation, Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, engaged in long-running litigation over the White House personnel file controversy. It was initially filed in September 1996 and sought $90 million in damages. Judicial Watch&#x27;s &quot;Cara Leslie Alexander et al. vs. Federal Bureau of Investigation et al.&quot; class action lawsuit, filed on behalf of five low-level former members of the Reagan and George H. W. Bush Administrations, alleged that Livingstone, along with Anthony Marceca and William Kennedy, obtained the files and then rifled through them. Judicial Watch in particular alleged that Kennedy had abused the FBI background report process. Judicial Watch founder and Clintons antagonist suprême Larry Klayman attracted enough attention with the case to have the recurring Larry Claypool character modeled after him on the television series &quot;The West Wing&quot;. As late as January 2000, Judicial Watch was filing affidavits in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia under Judge Royce C. Lamberth related to the case. In December 2002 Judicial Watch obtained a ruling from Judge Lamberth that recently uncovered White House e-mails be searched for possible evidence in the lawsuit. Klayman said, &quot;Hillary Clinton was the mastermind of Filegate. She will not escape justice.&quot; Klayman and Judicial Watch had a severe falling out in 2003, however, and several years went by with little or nothing happening in the lawsuit. 

On March 9, 2010, Judge Lamberth dismissed the case. The judge asserted that the plaintiffs, despite years of opportunity, had failed to provide any evidence that the affair was a grand conspiracy rather than a bureaucratic mistake, and said that &quot;this court is left to conclude that with the lawsuit, to quote Gertrude Stein, &#x27;there&#x27;s no there there. Nussbaum, one of the defendants, derisively said &quot;No kidding&quot; when informed of the dismissal. Media reports concluded that, fourteen years after the initial events were set in motion, Filegate was finally over. In May 2010, Judicial Watch filed an appeal of the dismissal with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, but the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal on November 14, 2011, thereby bringing the case to an end.

<text>Louis Keller (February 27, 1857 – February 16, 1922) was an American publisher, social arbiter of high society, and golf club owner. He was the founder of Baltusrol Golf Club in New Jersey and the first publisher of the &quot;Social Register&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Louis Keller was born on February 27, 1857, in New York City. His grandfather was from Switzerland. His French-born father, Charles M. Keller, was a lawyer who drafted the Patent Act of 1836 and served the first Commissioner of Patents. His French-born mother, Heloise de Chazournes, came from an aristocratic Catholic family who was prominent in New York society. They lived in an apartment at 128 Madison Avenue, where Louis grew up. They were not part of the New York elite because they were Catholic, not Protestant, nor were they long established in the United States. His father, who died when Louis was seventeen years old, had a dairy farm in Springfield, New Jersey.

===Career===
As a young adult, he was indecisive about starting a career. His attempt to reinvent himself as a gentleman farmer proved to be a failure. Instead, he took on the tradition of hosting an annual picnic on his family farm in Springfield, New Jersey, where he invited many members of high society. The event received extensive coverage in publications about high society each year. Indeed, the guest list was reprinted in those publications.

In 1885, he published a gossip newspaper about high society, &quot;Town Topics&quot;. Two years later, in 1887, he published the first issue of the &quot;Social Register&quot;. The publication was loosely based on the registry for the Metropolitan National Horse Show, held at the original Madison Square Garden on Madison Avenue and East 26th Street since 1883, listing its attendees and directors. It was copyrighted, thus forbidding anyone from publishing the entire list and making it more secret and exclusive. It was far more inclusive than Ward McAllister&#x27;s &quot;Four Hundred,&quot; the number, reputedly, that could be accommodated in the ballroom of Mrs. William Astor (Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor).

Through his associations with members of high society, he realized many of them were learning how to play golf. As a result, in 1895, he founded the Baltusrol Golf Club on his family farm. The name came from a friend who owned a farm called &quot;Baltusroll Way,&quot; named after farmer Baltus Roll (1769–1831). The golf course was designed by George Hunter, an Englishman. The club hosted championships of the United States Golf Association (USGA) in 1901, 1903 and 1904. However, the clubhouse burned down on March 27, 1909. It was rebuilt that same year, to the design of architect Chester Kirk. In 1915, the club hosted the U.S. Open. In 1916, Keller purchased more land to expand the golf course. Two years later, in 1918, Keller hired A. W. Tillinghast to build a second golf course to complement the Old Course. However, Tillinghast recommended that the Old Course be plowed over, and he went on to design and build two new courses, which were called the Upper and the Lower.

In order to provide better transportation to Baltusrol Golf Club, Keller became a partner in the New Orange Four Junction Railroad, which became the Rahway Valley Railroad in 1904. The railroad, based in New Orange, NJ (now Kenilworth), was extended to Summit, NJ in 1906, with a station a short walk from the golf club&#x27;s main gate. The Rahway Valley Railroad became one of the more successful short line railroads in the United States, operated by Mr. Keller&#x27;s estate following his death in 1922, until it was sold to Delaware Otsego Corporation in 1986.

He was a member of the (now defunct) Calumet Club of New York City and the Metropolitan Club of Washington, D.C., two social clubs. He was also a member of the Metropolitan Golf Association and the New Jersey State Golf Association.

===Personal life===
He resided at 12 West 56th Street. In &quot;Who Killed Society?&quot;, Cleveland Amory said he was &quot;uninterested in girls, had a curious looking drooping moustache, and spoke in a squeaky affected voice.&quot;

===Death===
He died of an intestinal ailment on February 16, 1922, at the French Hospital in New York City. He was 67 years old. At the time of his death, he was a resident of Springfield at the Baltusrol Golf Club.

<text>Vila Nova de Famalicão (), also known as Famalicão, is a Portuguese town in the Braga District and the sub-region of Vale do Ave. The population of &quot;Vila Nova&quot; was created in 1205 with the charter given by the King Sancho I. The municipality was created in 1835 as a detachment from Barcelos and was elevated to the category of “Vila” with the charter given by the Queen D. Maria II. In 1985, approved by National Assembly, Vila Nova de Famalicão was elevated to the category of &quot;city&quot;. The inhabitants of Famalicão are called &quot;Famalicenses&quot;.

The city is the south entrance of the Minho province and the last reference of the Minho province for whoever comes from the North of Portugal and the Spanish region of Galicia. Since ancestral times, its privileged location has been a motivation for the passage and fixation of other people who left marks of their ways and culture in the territory, still easily found nowadays. The municipality is bordered by Braga to the north, by Guimarães to the east, by Santo Tirso and Trofa to the south, by Vila do Conde and Póvoa de Varzim to the west and by Barcelos to the northwest. Due to its privileged location, Famalicão is currently served by a network of modern roads, with one of the most important motorway junctions of the country – A3 (Porto – Vigo) and A7 (Guimarães – Póvoa de Varzim), as well as a train service with direct connections to Braga, Guimarães, Porto, Vigo, Coimbra, Lisbon and Algarve.

Because of this strategic positioning, Famalicão is today mentioned as one of the main cultural, commercial and industrial centres of the country. The strength of its diverse industry and socio-economic dynamics are prominent features at national and international level. Vila Nova de Famalicão hosts the headquarters of some of the largest and best companies in the country in various industry sectors, with its maximum strength in the textile and clothing, automotive, agrofood and metal-mechanics sectors, giving it the 3rd place in the most exporting municipalities of the country and one of the major industrial economies in the North.

==History==

The historical remains on the origin of the settlement of this land, takes us to the Iron Age, more properly to archaeological remains of hillforts throughout the county.

&quot;Castro do Monte das Ermidas&quot;, perhaps founded in the 4th century BC, &quot;Castro de São Miguel-o-Anjo&quot; or &quot;Castro de Eiras&quot;, are some of the archaeological remains of remote settlements that the county has. The &quot;Pedra Formosa do Castro de Eiras&quot;, which belonged to a bathing complex, was discovered in 1880 and, according to archaeologists, it dates from the first millennium BC.

=== The 1205&#x27;s foral ===
D. Sancho I was forever remembered as the settler, king who sponsored the creation of settlements throughout the country, with a view to making Portugal a strong and dispersed kingdom, thus populating remote areas of the kingdom.

On 1 July 1205 King D. Sancho I of Portugal, who had a &quot;reguengo&quot; (land that belonged to the King) in &quot;Vila Nova&quot;, created a foral to 40 inhabitants of that land, giving authorization for them to deal with his reguengo, on which all the profits that the 40 settlers obtained in that piece of land would be perpetually theirs, by hereditary right, and could sell to whomever they wanted. Thus, the history of the village began from that moment.

In that same foral, the king orders the village to hold a biweekly fair, a tradition that still happens weekly.

=== The Municipality ===
Vila de Famalicão, as the head of the Judge of Vermoim, began to appreciate over the years, and so much so that in 1706 it counted 100 natural inhabitants of the land.

Continuing to boil interest in local development. In 1825, he decidedly asked Vila de Barcelos to create his own municipality, which he was unable to obtain.

Finally, ten years later and with the creation of the new &quot;Judicial Division of the Kingdom of Portugal&quot; on 21 March 1835, the municipality of Vila Nova de Famalicão was formed by the order of Queen D. Maria II.

<doc id="751718" wikidata="Q920229" url="?curid=751718" title="Temple Bar, Dublin">
<text>Temple Bar () is an area on the south bank of the River Liffey in central Dublin, Ireland. The area is bounded by the Liffey to the north, Dame Street to the south, Westmoreland Street to the east and Fishamble Street to the west. It is promoted as Dublin&#x27;s &#x27;cultural quarter&#x27; and, as a centre of Dublin&#x27;s city centre&#x27;s nightlife, is a tourist destination. Temple Bar is in the Dublin 2 postal district.

==History==
In medieval (Anglo-Norman) times, the name of the district was St. Andrews Parish. It was a suburb, located outside the city walls. However, the area fell into disuse beginning in the 14th century, as it was exposed to attacks by the native Irish.

The land was redeveloped in the 17th century, to create gardens for the houses of wealthy English families. At that time the shoreline of the River Liffey ran further inland of where it lies today, along the line formed by Essex Street, Temple Bar and Fleet Street. Marshy land to the river side of this line was progressively walled in and reclaimed, allowing houses to be built upon what had been the shoreline; but unusually, the reclaimed land was not quayed, so that the backyards of the houses ran down to the water&#x27;s edge. (Not until 1812 were these backyards replaced by Wellington Quay.) The fronts of the houses then constituted a new street. The first mention of Temple Bar as the name of this street is in Bernard de Gomme&#x27;s Map of Dublin from 1673, which shows the reclaimed land and new buildings. Other street names given nearby are Dammas Street (now Dame Street) and Dirty Lane (now Temple Lane South).

It is generally thought that the street known as Temple Bar got its name from the Temple family, whose progenitor Sir William Temple built a house and gardens there in the early 1600s. Temple had moved to Ireland in 1599 with the expeditionary force of the Earl of Essex, for whom he served as secretary. (He had previously been secretary of Sir Philip Sydney until the latter was killed in battle.) After Essex was beheaded for treason in 1601, Temple &quot;retired into private life&quot;, but he was then solicited to become provost of Trinity College, serving from 1609 until his death in 1627 at age 72. William Temple&#x27;s son John became the Master of the Rolls in Ireland (a senior judicial position) and was the author of a famous pamphlet excoriating the native Irish population for an uprising in 1641. John&#x27;s son William Temple became a famous English statesman.

Despite this grand lineage, however, the name of Temple Bar street seems to have been more directly borrowed from the storied Temple Bar district in London, where the main toll gate into London was located dating back to medieval times.

London&#x27;s Temple Bar is adjoined by Essex Street to the west and Fleet Street to the east, and streets of the same names occupy similar positions in relation to Dublin&#x27;s Temple Bar. It seems almost certain therefore that Dublin&#x27;s Temple Bar was named firstly in imitation of the historic Temple precinct in London. However, a secondary and equally plausible reason for using the name Temple Bar in Dublin would be a reference to one of the area&#x27;s most prominent families, in a sort of pun or play on words. Or as it has been put more succinctly, Temple Bar &#x27;does honour to London and the landlord in nicely-gauged proportions&#x27;.

Fishamble Street near Temple Bar was the location of the first performance of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; on 13 April 1742. An annual performance of the &quot;Messiah&quot; is held on the same date at the same location. A republican revolutionary group, the Society of the United Irishmen, was formed at a meeting in a tavern in Eustace Street in 1791.

In the 18th century, Temple Bar was the centre of prostitution in Dublin. During the 19th century, the area slowly declined in popularity, and in the 20th century, it suffered from urban decay, with many derelict buildings.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the state-owned transport company Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ) proposed to buy up and demolish property in the area and build a bus terminus in its place. While that was in the planning stages, the purchased buildings were let out at low rents, which attracted small shops, artists and galleries to the area. The plans included a large underground carpark with 1,500 spaces, a shopping centre on the ground and first floors, with the bus station at second-floor level accessed by large, long ramps to accommodate double-decker buses. Protests by An Taisce, residents and traders led to the cancellation of the bus station project, and then Taoiseach Charles Haughey was responsible for securing funding, and, in 1991, the government set up a not-for-profit company called &quot;Temple Bar Properties&quot;, managed by Laura Magahy, to oversee the regeneration of the area as Dublin&#x27;s cultural quarter.

In 1999, stag parties and hen nights were supposedly banned (or discouraged) from Temple Bar, mainly due to drunken, loutish behaviour; this seems to have lapsed. However, noise and anti-social behaviour remain a problem at night.

==Present day==
The area is the location of a number of cultural institutions, including the Irish Photography Centre (incorporating the Dublin Institute of Photography, the National Photographic Archive and the Gallery of Photography), the Ark Children&#x27;s Cultural Centre, the Irish Film Institute, incorporating the Irish Film Archive, the Button Factory (music venue and club), the Arthouse Multimedia Centre, Temple Bar Gallery and Studios, the Project Arts Centre, the Gaiety School of Acting, IBAT College Dublin, the New Theatre, as well as the Irish Stock Exchange.

At night the area is a centre for nightlife, with various nightclubs, restaurants and bars geared towards tourists. Pubs in the area include The Temple Bar pub, and The Porterhouse.

The area has two renovated squares – &quot;Meetinghouse Square&quot; and the central &quot;Temple Bar Square&quot;. The Temple Bar Book Market is held on Saturdays and Sundays in Temple Bar Square. Meetinghouse Square, which takes its name from the nearby Quaker Meeting House, is used for outdoor film screenings in the summer months. Since summer 2004, Meetinghouse Square is also home to the &#x27;Speaker&#x27;s Square&#x27; project (an area of public speaking) and the &#x27;Temple Bar Food Market&#x27; on Saturdays.

The &#x27;Cow&#x27;s Lane Market&#x27; is a fashion and design market which takes place on Cow&#x27;s Lane on Saturdays.

Part of the 13th-century Augustinian Friary of the Holy Trinity is visible within an apartment/restaurant complex called &#x27;The Friary&#x27;.

==In popular culture==
A dance sequence from the Bollywood film &quot;Ek Tha Tiger&quot; was filmed in the area. Irish singer/songwriter Billy Treacy wrote a song about the area, and country singer Nathan Carter as well as Irish rock band Kodaline have released songs called Temple Bar.

<doc id="751719" wikidata="Q1301168" url="?curid=751719" title="The Tale of Kieu">
<text>The Tale of Kiều is an epic poem in Vietnamese written by Nguyễn Du (1765–1820), well known in Vietnamese literature. The original title in Vietnamese is &quot;Đoạn Trường Tân Thanh&quot; (, &quot;A New Cry From a Broken Heart&quot;), but it is better known as Truyện Kiều (, , lit. &quot;Tale of Kiều&quot;).

In 3,254 verses, written in &quot;lục bát&quot; (&quot;six–eight&quot;) meter, the poem recounts the life, trials and tribulations of Thúy Kiều, a beautiful and talented young woman, who has to sacrifice herself to save her family. To save her father and younger brother from prison, she sells herself into marriage with a middle-aged man, not knowing that he is a pimp, and is forced into prostitution. While modern interpretations vary, some post-colonial writers have interpreted it as a critical, allegorical reflection on the rise of the Nguyễn dynasty.

The work is famous for its humane meaning and was translated into 20 languages, such as English, French, Japanese, Korean...

==Background==
Nguyễn Du made use of the plot of a seventeenth-century Chinese novel, &quot;Jīn Yún Qiào&quot; (), known in Vietnamese pronunciation of Chinese characters as &quot;Kim Vân Kiều&quot;. The original, written by Xu Wei under the pseudonym &quot;Qīngxīn Cáirén&quot; ( &quot;Pure-Hearted Man of Talent&quot;), was a straightforward romance, but Nguyễn Du chose it to convey the social and political upheavals at the end of the 18th century in Vietnam.

Vietnam at that time was ruled nominally by the 300-year-old Lê dynasty, but real power rested in the Trịnh lords in the north and the Nguyễn lords in the south. While the Trịnh and the Nguyễn were fighting against each other, the Tây Sơn rebels overthrew both the Nguyễn and then the Trịnh over the span of a decade. Nguyễn Du was loyal to the Lê Dynasty and hoped for the return of the Lê emperor. In 1802 the Nguyễn lord Nguyễn Ánh conquered all of Vietnam forming the new Nguyễn dynasty. Nguyễn Ánh, now Emperor Gia Long, summoned Nguyễn Du to join the new government and, with some reluctance, he did so. Nguyễn Du&#x27;s situation in terms of conflicting loyalties between the previous Lê king and the current Nguyễn emperor is partially analogous to the situation of the main character in &quot;The Tale of Kiều&quot; who submitted to circumstances but her heart longed for her first love.

=== Depiction of sex work ===

It is believed that &quot;The Tale of &quot; contains the earliest depiction or mention of sex work in Vietnam. The poem depicts a form of sex work that resembles Chinese courtesan culture. Although the poem is fictional, it reveals a view of sex work in 19th century Vietnam as a kind of performative and affective, not simply sexual, labor.

== Plot ==
The story takes place during the reign of the Jiajing Emperor in Ming China. The entire plot in the Tale of Kiều spans over fifteen years. At the beginning of the story, set in Peking, Vương Thuý Kiều (Wang Cuiqiao) () — a beautiful and educated girl — visits her ancestors&#x27; graves with her younger sister Thuý Vân () and brother Vương Quan (). On the way she identifies with the grave of a dead performer—Đạm Tiên (), who was said to be as beautiful and talented as she is but lived a life full of grief. There, she meets and later promises to marry Kim Trọng (), a young and promising scholar, but their marriage is delayed because Trọng has to go back home to mourn his uncle for half a year.

During that time misfortune begins to befall Kiều. Her family is framed by a silk dealer and has all their wealth taken away by the government: her father and brother facing imprisonment. Kiều decides to sell herself to Scholar Mã (Mã giám sinh; ) to free her family, while asking Thúy Vân to fulfil the marital promise with Trọng. Mã turns out to be a pimp who is in charge of finding girls for a brothel run by Madam Tú (Tú Bà; ). He rapes Kiều and takes her back to the brothel in Lin-Tzu (modern day Xindian in Shandong), but she refuses to serve any guests and attempts to commit suicide when she is forced to do so. Madam Tú concocts a plan to crush Kiều&#x27;s dignity by hiring Sở Khanh, a playboy and con artist, to meet Kiều and coerce her into eloping with him, and then lead her to Tú. With nothing left to hold on to, Kiều finally submits and becomes a prostitute. Kiều&#x27;s beauty attracts many men, including Student Thúc (Thúc Sinh; ), who uses his wealth to buy Kiều out of the brothel and marry her, although he already has a wife named Lady Hoạn (Hoạn Thư; ), who is the daughter of prime minister Hoạn. Upon learning of this, Hoạn burns up with jealousy and secretly tells her henchmen to kidnap and force Kiều to become a slave in her house when Thúc is on the way to visit her. Thúc is shocked at the sight of Kiều as a slave, but never dares to reach out to her in front of his first wife.

Kiều runs away from the estate, stealing some valuable decorations on the altar in the process. She goes to a Buddhist temple, where nun Giác Duyên () graciously accepts her. However, after realizing that Kiều is carrying stolen property, Giác Duyên sends Kiều to Madam Bạc&#x27;s (Tú Bạc; ), whom Giác Duyên thinks Kiều will be safe with. However it turns out that Madam Bạc runs a brothel, so Kiều gets tricked into the brothel again where she meets , leader of a revolution army. Từ Hải and Kiều get married and live together for five years, together reigning over a temporary kingdom. Later tricked by Hồ Tôn Hiến, Kiều convinces her husband to surrender all in favor of amnesty. This eventually leads to the invasion of Từ Hải&#x27;s kingdom, and the death of Từ Hải himself. Mesmerized by Kiều&#x27;s beauty, Hồ Tôn Hiến forces her to perform in his victory banquet, where he falls in love with her. To avoid bad rumors, he hurriedly marries Kiều off to a local official. Feeling devastated, she throws herself into the Qiantang River. Once again, Giác Duyên saves her, as she knew about Kiều&#x27;s fate when she consulted with Tam Hợp, who is believed to be able to see into the future, long ago. Meanwhile, Kim Trọng, Kiều&#x27;s first love, becomes an official and is providing housing for Kiều&#x27;s parents. He has been searching for Kiều, and eventually finds her with the buddhist nun Giác Duyên. Kiều is reunited with her first love and her family, thus ending her cycle of bad karma. She is married to Kim Trọng, but refuses to have a physical relationship with him, finally honoring all her vows of young age.
==English translations==
There have been at least five English translations of the work in the last half century. &quot;Kim Van Kieu&quot; by Lê Xuân Thuy, presenting the work in the form of a novelette, was widely available in Vietnam in the 1960s. &quot;The Tale of Kiều&quot;, a scholarly annotated blank verse version by Huỳnh Sanh Thông (1926–2008), was first published in the US in 1983. In 2008, a translation by Arno Abbey, based on the French translation by Nguyễn Khắc Viện (1913–1997), was published in the US.

There have also been two verse translations in recent years. One of these, another bilingual edition called simply &quot;Kiều&quot; published by Thế Giới Publishers, Hanoi, in 1994, with a verse translation by Michael Counsell (born 1935), is currently the English version most widely available in Vietnam itself, and the English version alone, called &quot;Kieu, The Tale of a Beautiful and Talented Girl, by Nguyễn Du&quot;, is now available worldwide. A second verse translation, &quot;The Kim Vân Kiều of Nguyễn Du (1765–1820)&quot;, by Vladislav Zhukov (born 1941), was published by Pandanus books in 2004.

A new translation by Timothy Allen of the opening section of the poem was awarded one of &quot;The Times&quot; Stephen Spender prizes for Poetry Translation in 2008; further extracts from Allen&#x27;s translation have appeared in &quot;Cosmopolis&quot;, (the Summer 2009 edition of &quot;Poetry Review&quot;.) and in &quot;Transplants&quot;, the Spring 2010 edition of &quot;Modern Poetry in Translation&quot;. Allen&#x27;s translation was published in its entirety in 2019 as &quot;The Song of Kieu&quot;.

An English translation by Dương Tường, which took more than two years, was published in 2020 by Nhã Nam. In 2021, a translation by twenty-year-old Nguyễn Bình from the Vietnamese into heroic couplets was published by the Vietnamese Writers&#x27; Association Publishing House. A student pursuing an astronomy degree in the United States, Bình cited homesickness as a motivation for the translation and cited being influenced by English translations of Greco-Roman epics by Alexander Pope and John Dryden. In January 2022, the translation won first prize in the Young Authors&#x27; Award of the Vietnamese Writers&#x27; Association in the Translation category.

== Comparison with Jin Yun Qiao ==
&quot;The Tale of Kiều&quot; adapted the Chinese novel &quot;Jin Yun Qiao&quot; into Vietnamese lục bát verses. Thus, there has been many works that compare the two in both Vietnamese and Chinese. The first person to do the work is Đào Duy Anh, who wrote in his book: &quot;Nguyễn Du preserved the Chinese story without cutting or adding anything. But the original is redundant, detailed, presented in a simple way, while Nguyễn Du calculated and rearranged [the story] to be more organized and coherent.&quot; Researcher Phạm Đan Quế said: &quot;...Nguyễn Du&#x27;s story, characters, order of events, morality, philosophy and even details are mostly from the original by Qingxin-caizi. However, he selected main events and cut redundant parts, and sometime summarized long paragraphs into a few sentences. The main different is that: the events in Jin Yun Qiao are analytical, while [the events] in Tale of Kiều are organic [...] Through comparisons, we can see that Nguyễn Du preserved the order of events from the original story. However he cut the entirety of chapter 5 and 6, and instead scatter them between previous chapters. It&#x27;s worth noting that Nguyễn Du told chapter 20, which is about the reunion with Kim Trọng, in 526 sentences, equal to 1/6 of the work.&quot; However Nguyễn Hữu Sơn noted that what Đào and Phạm believed to be &quot;redundant&quot; in &quot;Jin Yun Qiao&quot; is actually its strong point, as prose requires different storytelling technique from rhymed poetry. He also believes that the Tale of Kiều is more emotional than the original.

==Text comparisons==
The original text was written in Vietnamese using the vernacular chữ Nôm script. Below are the first six lines of the prologue written in modern Vietnamese alphabet and several translations into English.

===English translations===
From Lê Xuân Thuy&#x27;s &quot;Kim Vân Kiều&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;
Within the span of hundred years of human existence,
what a bitter struggle is waged between genius and destiny!
How many harrowing events have occurred while mulberries cover the conquered sea!
Rich in beauty, unlucky in life!
Strange indeed, but little wonder,
since casting hatred upon rosy cheeks is a habit of the Blue Sky.
&lt;/poem&gt;
Blank verse translation by Huỳnh Sanh Thông (1983):
&lt;poem&gt;
A hundred years—in this life span on earth,
talent and destiny are apt to feud.
You must go through a play of ebb and flow
and watch such things as make you sick at heart.
Is it so strange that losses balance gains?
Blue Heaven&#x27;s wont to strike a rose from spite.
&lt;/poem&gt;
English translation by Michael Counsell (1994):
&lt;poem&gt;
What tragedies take place
within each circling space of years!
&#x27;Rich in good looks&#x27; appears
to mean poor luck and tears of woe;
which may sound strange, I know,
but is not really so, I swear,
since Heaven everywhere
seems jealous of the fair of face.
&lt;/poem&gt;
English translation by Vladislav Zhukov (2004):
&lt;poem&gt;
Were full five-score the years allotted to born man,
How oft his qualities might yield within that span to fate forlorn!
In time the mulberry reclaims the sunk sea-bourn,
And what the gliding eye may first find fair weighs mournful on the heart.
Uncanny? Nay—lack ever proved glut&#x27;s counterpart,
And mindful are the gods on rosy cheeks to dart celestial spite...
&lt;/poem&gt;
English translation by Phan Huy MPH (2010):

&lt;poem&gt;
In the hundred-year span of a human life,
Talent and fate are always apt to strife.
Through experience of a harrowing change,
What we witnessed filled our hearts with tearing pain.
‘Tis not a wonder that Heaven gives then takes,
And with the fair sex He used to be jealous.
&lt;/poem&gt;
English translation by Timothy Allen (2019):

&lt;poem&gt;
It&#x27;s an old story: good luck and good looks 
don&#x27;t always mix. 
Tragedy is circular and infinite. 
The plain never believe it, 
but good-looking people meet with hard times too. 
It&#x27;s true. 
Our ending is inevitable: 
long years betray the beautiful.
&lt;/poem&gt;
Heroic couplet translation by Nguyễn Bình (2021):
&lt;poem&gt;
A hundred years alive in Man&#x27;s demesne, 
&#x27;Tween Fate and Talent hatred seems to reign. 
Of oceans changed to various berry plains, 
The sight imbues the heart with cruel pains. 
It is not strange that no one&#x27;s rich in all, 
That rosy cheeks cause envious Heav&#x27;n to brawl.
&lt;/poem&gt;
English translation by Vuong Thanh (2022):

&lt;poem&gt;
Within a hundred-year lifespan in this earthly world, 
Genius and Destiny have a tendency to oppose each other.
A turbulent mulberry-field-covered-by-sea period had passed.
The things that we saw still deeply pain our hearts.
It’s not strange that beauty may beget misery.
The jealous gods tend to heap spites on rosy-cheeked beauties.
&lt;/poem&gt;
== Artistic adaptations ==

As an integral part of Vietnamese literature for 200 years, &quot;The Tale of Kiều&quot; had been the inspiration for numerous works. The poem had been adapted into numerous other art forms, including 
cải lương, chèo, pantomime and Western-style operas.

The first theatrical film created in Vietnam, in 1924, was . The film followed closely the plot of the poem. The 30 or so actors in the film were traditional opera performers, and so the film was not a critical or commercial success.

The musician Phạm Duy adapted &quot;The Tale of Kiều&quot; into an epic song cycle entitled &quot;Minh họa Kiều&quot; (&quot;Illustrating Kieu&quot;) in 1997.

&quot;The Tale of Kieu&quot; was the inspiration for the 2007 movie &quot;Saigon Eclipse&quot;, which moved the storyline into a modern Vietnamese setting with a modern-day immigrant Kiều working in the massage parlor industry in San Francisco&#x27;s Mission District to support her family back in Vietnam. Additionally, Burton Wolfe directed a musical adaptation which premiered September 10, 2010 in Houston.

&#x27;s 2020 music video entitled &quot;Bức bình phong&quot; (&quot;Folding screen&quot;) is set in a researcher of ancient works living in modern times, while reading The Tale of Kiều, happened to be lost in Wang Cuiqiao&#x27;s timeline.

A film released in April 2021, entitled , generated controversies when it released its first teaser clip in September 2020. At issue was the use of the modern Latin-based Vietnamese alphabet in signage in a film based on a poem written in chữ Nôm and set in Ming China. Near the official premiere date, the film has been evaluated as a disaster, &quot;ruined&quot; &quot;The Tale of Kieu&quot;. The film performed poorly at the box office, grossing only VND 2,696,659,000 (USD 107,444,000) and later turned into a web film.

<doc id="751721" wikidata="Q1047350" url="?curid=751721" title="USS Plunger (SS-2)">
<text>USS &quot;Plunger&quot; (SS-2) was one of the earliest submarines of the United States Navy. She was the lead boat of her class and was later renamed A-1 when she was designated an A-type submarine. She is not to be confused with the experimental submarine &quot;Plunger&quot; which was evaluated by the U.S. Navy from 1898 to 1900, but not accepted or commissioned.

== Early service ==
&quot;Plunger&quot; was originally laid down on 21 May 1901 at Elizabethport, New Jersey, at Lewis Nixon&#x27;s Crescent Shipyard. Arthur Leopold Busch supervised the construction of the A-Class submarines built there. The prototype Fulton experimental craft was laid down at Isaac Rice&#x27;s Electric Boat Company prior to these first A-class submarines.

She was launched on 1 February 1902, and commissioned at the Holland Torpedo Boat Company yard at Holland Torpedo Boat Station, New Suffolk, New York on 19 September 1903.

Assigned to the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island for experimental torpedo work, &quot;Plunger&quot; operated locally from that facility for the next two years, a period of time broken only by an overhaul at the Holland yard at New Suffolk from March to November 1904. Besides testing machinery, armament and tactics, the submarine torpedo boat also served as a training ship for the crews of new submersibles emerging from the builder&#x27;s yards.

In August 1905, &quot;Plunger&quot; underwent two weeks of upkeep before leaving the yard on 22 August. She was towed by the tug to New York City, where &quot;Plunger&quot; conducted trials near the home of President Theodore Roosevelt. Upon the submarine&#x27;s arrival that afternoon, she moored alongside the tug and prepared for a visit from President Roosevelt.

== President Roosevelt&#x27;s visit ==
The following morning, &quot;Plunger&quot; charged her batteries and made a series of five short dives before returning alongside &quot;Apache&quot; to recharge. Later that afternoon, Roosevelt boarded the &quot;Plunger&quot; and stayed aboard for almost two hours while she made another series of dives before returning to moor alongside the tug. Roosevelt spent almost another hour on board the submarine before he left.

Roosevelt&#x27;s novel voyage prompted significant interest. On 6 September, Roosevelt wrote from Oyster Bay to Hermann Speck von Sternburg: &quot;I myself am both amused and interested as to what you say about the interest excited about my trip in the &quot;Plunger&quot;. I went down in it chiefly because I did not like to have the officers and enlisted men think I wanted them to try things I was reluctant to try myself. I believe a good deal can be done with these submarines, although there is always the danger of people getting carried away with the idea and thinking that they can be of more use than they possibly could be.&quot; To another correspondent he declared that never in his life had he experienced &quot;such a diverting day ... nor so much enjoyment in so few hours.&quot;

== Later service ==
Decommissioned on 3 November 1905, &quot;Plunger&quot; remained inactive until she was recommissioned on 23 February 1907. On 3 May 1909, Ensign Chester Nimitz, the future fleet admiral who would say he considered the submarines of the time &quot;a cross between a Jules Verne fantasy and a humpbacked whale&quot;, assumed command of &quot;Plunger&quot;. That September, the submarine torpedo boat visited New York City to take part in the Hudson-Fulton celebrations. Nimitz commanded &quot;Plunger&quot; until he assumed command of USS &quot;Snapper&quot; (later renamed C-5), when that submarine was commissioned on February 2, 1910.

Reassigned to the Charleston Navy Yard, &quot;Plunger&quot; reached that port on 24 October and moored alongside the gunboat , the tender for the Atlantic Submarine Flotilla. Shortly thereafter, &quot;Castine&quot;″s medical officer, Assistant Surgeon Micajah Boland, inspected &quot;Plunger&quot; and two other submarine torpedo boats. His report graphically described living conditions on these boats. He found &quot;their sanitary condition to be far from satisfactory, notwithstanding the fact that they had been at sea only about forty-five hours.&quot;

&quot;Plunger&quot; was renamed &quot;A-1&quot; on 17 November 1911. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 24 February 1913.

By 1916, &quot;A-1&quot; had been authorized for use as an &quot;experimental target, designated &#x27;Target E&#x27;&quot;. Approximately 22 March 1918 she sank at New Suffolk, Massachusetts. Raised and sent to the Salvage Diving School at New London, Connecticut. She was ultimately hoisted on board the hulk of the former monitor and authorized for sale in 1921, on an &quot;as is, where is&quot; basis. She was sold for scrapping on 26 January 1922.

<text>I Spit on Your Grave (originally titled Day of the Woman) is a 1978 American rape and revenge film written and directed by Meir Zarchi. The film tells the story of Jennifer Hills (Camille Keaton), a fiction writer based in New York City who exacts revenge on her four tormentors who gang rape and leave her for dead.

&quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; is noted for its controversial depiction of extreme graphic violence, particularly the lengthy depictions of gang rape, that take up 30 minutes of its runtime. During its wider release, it was branded a &quot;video nasty&quot; in the United Kingdom, and was a target of censorship by film commissioning bodies. Film critic Roger Ebert became one of the most notable detractors of &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot;, calling it &quot;a vile bag of garbage&quot;.

The film remains highly controversial to this day, even being considered to be one of the worst ever made. For some, it is this controversy which has led to it being deemed a cult classic. Despite the controversy and overwhelmingly negative reviews, the performance of Keaton was praised by critics. In 2010, &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; was included in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 Ridiculously Violent Movies&quot;.

The film spawned a 2010 remake, which has since spawned two sequels of its own: &quot;I Spit on Your Grave 2&quot; (2013), and &quot;I Spit on Your Grave III: Vengeance Is Mine&quot; (2015). A direct sequel, &quot;I Spit on Your Grave: Deja Vu&quot;, was released in 2019 with Zarchi and Keaton both returning.

In her memoir &quot;Inside Out&quot;, Demi Moore confirmed that she is the scantily clad woman on the film&#x27;s poster with her back turned.

==Plot==
Short story writer Jennifer Hills lives in Manhattan and rents an isolated cottage in Kent, Connecticut near the Housatonic River in the Litchfield County countryside to write her first novel. The arrival of the attractive and independent young woman attracts the attention of Johnny Stillman, the gas station manager, and Stanley Woods and Andy Chirensky, two unemployed men. Jennifer has her groceries delivered by Matthew Duncan, who is mildly mentally disabled. Matthew is friends with the other three men and reports back to them about the beautiful woman he met, claiming that he saw her breasts.

Stanley and Andy start cruising by the cottage in their boat and prowl around the house at night. One day, the two men attack Jennifer while she&#x27;s on her boat. They drag her to shore, and Johnny joins them. Jennifer realizes that they planned her abduction so Matthew could lose his virginity. She fights back, but the three men rip her bikini off and hold her. Matthew refuses to rape Jennifer out of respect and pity for her, so Johnny and Andy rape her instead. After she crawls back to her house, they attack her again. Matthew finally rapes her after drinking alcohol but doesn&#x27;t ejaculate because the others are watching. The other men ridicule her book and rip up the manuscript, and Stanley violently sexually assaults her. She passes out; the men start to leave, but Johnny realizes that she is a witness to their crimes and orders Matthew to go and murder her. Matthew, remorseful over his actions, cannot bring himself to stab the still-unconscious Jennifer, so he dabs the knife in her blood and then returns to the other men, claiming that he has killed her.

In the following days, a traumatized Jennifer pieces both herself and her manuscript back together. She goes to church and asks for forgiveness for what she plans to do. The men learn that Jennifer has survived and beat Matthew up for deceiving them. Jennifer calls in a grocery order, knowing that Matthew will deliver it. He takes the groceries and a knife. At the cabin, Jennifer entices him to have sex with her under a tree. She then hangs him and drops his body into the lake.

At the gas station, Jennifer seductively directs Johnny to enter her car. She stops halfway to her house, points a gun at him, and orders him to remove all his clothing. Johnny insists that the rapes were all her fault because she enticed the men by parading around in revealing clothing. She pretends to believe this and invites him back to her cottage for a hot bath, where she gives him a handjob. When Johnny mentions that Matthew has been reported missing, Jennifer states that she killed him, which he takes as a joke; as he nears orgasm, she takes the knife Matthew brought with him and severs Johnny&#x27;s genitals. She leaves the bathroom, locks the door, and listens to opera music as Johnny screams, bleeding to death. After he dies, she dumps his body in the basement and burns his clothes in the fireplace.

Stanley and Andy learn that Johnny is missing and take their boat to Jennifer&#x27;s cabin. Andy goes ashore with an axe. Jennifer swims out to the boat and pushes Stanley overboard. Andy tries to attack her, but she escapes with the axe. Andy swims out to rescue Stanley, but Jennifer plunges the axe into Andy&#x27;s back, killing him. Stanley moves towards the boat and grabs hold of the motor to climb aboard, begging Jennifer not to kill him. She repeats the order he made to her during the sexual assaults, &quot;Suck it, bitch!&quot;, then starts the motor, disemboweling him with the propeller as she speeds away.

==Production==
===Writing===
The inspiration for &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; came from an encounter writer-director Meir Zarchi had in 1974 with a young woman who was raped and beaten by two men at a park in New York City. The idea did not begin to fully develop until Yuri Haviv, the film&#x27;s cinematographer, invited Zarchi to spend the weekend at a summer house he had rented in Kent, Connecticut which contains an extension of the Housatonic River nearby. Zarchi eventually chose to shoot in these locations because they provided a tranquil atmosphere for the film&#x27;s antiheroine, Jennifer Hills. He spent four months writing the screenplay, the bulk of which was written at his usual subway route to his office in Times Square and back home where his wife would then typewrite the handwritten pages in the evening. The typewriter his wife had used is seen in the film as the same one Jennifer uses to complete her manuscript.

===Casting===
To cast the stars, Zarchi put up a casting call advertisement in &quot;Backstage&quot; magazine that sought one woman and four men in their 20s to star in a low-budget production. Camille Keaton was one of over 4,000 actresses who auditioned for the role of Jennifer. Zarchi set up an interview for Keaton and found her to be an &quot;experienced actress&quot; as well as &quot;beautiful and photogenic&quot;. After a series of auditions to test Keaton&#x27;s suitability for the role, Zarchi was convinced that she could play it effectively.

==Release==
Zarchi was unable to find a distributor, so he distributed the film himself. &quot;Day of the Woman&quot; played a number of engagements in rural drive-in theaters, but only for brief runs each time, and Zarchi barely made back the money he had spent on advertising. In 1980, it was picked up for distribution by the Jerry Gross Organization. A condition of this re-release was that the distributors could change the title to anything they wished. It was at this time the film was retitled &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot;. The movie did not have a theatrical release in the United Kingdom and was solely released on home video in that country.

===Commercial performance===
The film did poorly at the box office but managed to have some success in videocassette sales. &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; reached number 24 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 1981 list of best-selling titles. The film stayed in the Billboard Video Cassette Top Forty for 14 consecutive weeks and won the number one best-selling video cassette award above more popular movies like &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; and &quot;Grease&quot;. By 1982, &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; had been released on video six times in the United States due to high demand. In a 1984 interview with &quot;Fangoria&quot;, Zarchi said, &quot;I found out that of the millions of video machines in England, there&#x27;s maybe one single house that has not seen &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot;.&quot; He claimed that by that point 20 million people worldwide had seen &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; received several negative reviews from critics. Roger Ebert gave the film no stars, referring to it as &quot;A vile bag of garbage ... without a shred of artistic distinction,&quot; adding, &quot;Attending it was one of the most depressing experiences of my life&quot; and considered it the worst movie ever made. Gene Siskel also considered it one of the worst films ever made. Critic Luke Y. Thompson of &quot;The New Times&quot; stated that &quot;defenders of the film have argued that it is actually pro-woman, due to the fact that the female lead wins in the end, which is sort of like saying that cockfights are pro-rooster because there is always one left standing&quot;.
A contributor to &quot;Encyclopedia of Horror&quot; notes that the film attracted much debate for and against, frequently involving people who clearly had not actually seen the film. &quot;The men are so grossly unattractive and the rapes so harrowing, long-drawn-out and starkly presented, it is hard to imagine most male spectators identifying with the perpetrators, especially as the film&#x27;s narrative structure and &quot;mise-en-scene&quot; force the spectator to view the action from Keaton&#x27;s point of view. Further, there is no suggestion that she &#x27;asked for it&#x27; or enjoyed it, except, of course, in the rapists&#x27; own perceptions, from which the film is careful to distance itself.&quot; The author continues that the scenes of revenge were &quot;grotesquely misread by some critics&quot;, as Jennifer only &quot;pretends to have enjoyed the rape so as to lure the men to their destruction,&quot; and that in these scenes, the film is critiquing &quot;familiar male arguments about women &#x27;bringing it on as &quot;simply sexist, self-excusing rhetoric and are quite clearly presented as such&quot;.

===Later reception===
The initial criticism was followed by reappraisals of the film. Michael Kaminski&#x27;s 2007 article for the website &quot;Obsessed with Film&quot;, titled &quot;Is &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; Really A Misunderstood Feminist Film?&quot; argues that, when understood within the context in which director Zarchi was inspired to make it, the movie may be equally appropriate to analyze as &quot;feminist wish-fulfillment&quot; and a vehicle of personal expression reacting to violence against women.

A reappraisal was made by Carol J. Clover in the third chapter of her 1992 book &quot;Men, Women, and Chainsaws&quot;. Clover notes that she and others like her &quot;appreciate, however grudgingly, the way in which [the movie&#x27;s] brutal simplicity exposes a mainspring of popular culture.&quot; Clover further argues that the film&#x27;s sympathies are entirely with Jennifer, that the male audience is meant to identify with her and not with the attackers, and that the point of the film is a masochistic identification with pain used to justify the bloody catharsis of revenge. Clover wrote that, in her opinion, the film owes a debt to &quot;Deliverance&quot;. The British feminist Julie Bindel, who claimed to have been involved in pickets outside cinemas in Leeds when the film was released, has said that she was wrong about the film and that it is a feminist film.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; holds an approval rating of 51%, based on 39 reviews, and an average rating of 5.4/10. Its consensus reads, &quot;&quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; is as aggressively exploitative as its title suggests, although as a crude rejoinder to misogyny, it packs a certain amount of undeniable power.&quot;

==Controversy==
The film caused significant controversy and backlash for its graphic violence, particularly the rape scene, with feminists protesting the movie and people accusing the movie of glorifying rape. The Motion Picture Association of America tried to prevent the film&#x27;s producers from using the R rating. After the association gave &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; an R rating, the producer of the film added rape scenes, making it an X-rated movie. Ultimately an agreement was reached where the film removed any references or explicit shots referring to anal rape and the MPAA restored the original R rating. In an interview with &quot;Fangoria&quot;, director Meir Zarchi said as a response to the backlash: 

===International bans===
Many nations, including Ireland, Norway, Iceland, and West Germany, banned the film altogether, claiming that it &quot;glorified violence against women&quot;. Canada initially banned the film, but in the 1990s decided to allow its individual provinces to decide whether to permit its release. Since 1998, some provinces (such as Manitoba, Nova Scotia, and Quebec) have released the film, with a rating that reflects its content.

The censored American version of the film was released in Australia in 1982 with an R 18+ rating. In 1987, the film survived an appeal to ban it. It continued to be sold until 1997, when another reclassification caused its ban in Australia. In 2004, the full uncut version was awarded an R 18+, lifting the seven-year ban. The Office of Film and Literature Classification justified this decision by reasoning that castration is not sexual violence (Australian censorship law forbids the release of films that depict scenes of sexual violence as acceptable or justified).

In the United Kingdom, the film was refused a cinema certificate by the British censors. However, since films on video did not need censor&#x27;s certificates at the time, it was released on home video, where it was branded a &quot;video nasty&quot; by the press. It appeared on the Director of Public Prosecutions&#x27; list of prosecutable films until 2001 when a heavily cut version that extensively edited the rape scenes was released with an 18 certificate. The cuts were reduced considerably from 7 minutes 2 seconds in the 2001 release to 2 minutes 54 seconds in the 2011 release so that only the scenes of rape that focus on Jennifer&#x27;s nudity have been banned since the 2011 release.

In New Zealand, the uncut version of the film (102 minutes) was classified in 1984 as R20 with the descriptive note, &quot;Contains graphic violence, content may disturb&quot;. Other versions with shorter running times (96 minutes) were also classified in 1984 and 1985 and received the same classification.

The Irish Film Classification Office has again banned the film from sale. Having been banned for many years in the country, the new Blu-ray and DVD uncensored edition have been prohibited from purchase by retailers due to the nature of the film.

===Zarchi&#x27;s inspiration and responses to criticism===
In the commentary for the Millennium Edition, Zarchi said he was inspired to produce the film after helping a young woman who had been raped in New York. He tells of how he, a friend and his daughter were driving by a park when they witnessed a young woman crawling out of the bushes bloodied and naked (he later learned the young woman was taking a common shortcut to her boyfriend&#x27;s house when she was attacked). They collected the traumatized girl, returned the daughter home, and quickly decided it was best to take the girl to the police rather than a hospital, lest the attackers escape and find further victims.

They quickly decided that they had made the wrong decision — the officer, who Zarchi described as &quot;not fit to wear the uniform&quot;, delayed taking her to the hospital and instead insisted that she follow formalities such as giving her full name (and the spelling), even though her jaw had been broken and she could hardly speak. Zarchi insisted that the officer take her to the hospital and he eventually complied. Soon afterward, the woman&#x27;s father wrote both Zarchi and his friend a letter of thanks for helping his daughter. The father offered a reward, which Zarchi refused.

In the same commentary, Zarchi denied that the film was exploitative, saying that the violent nature of the film was necessary to tell the story. He described actress Camille Keaton as &quot;brave&quot; for taking on the role.

==Sequels and remake==

The film was followed by an unofficial sequel, &quot;Savage Vengeance&quot; (the title card on the film was misspelled as &quot;Savage Vengance&quot;) (1993) in which Camille Keaton (under the alias of Vickie Kehl for unknown reasons) reprises the role of Jennifer. However, no scenes from &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; were used for the flashbacks. The film&#x27;s runtime was only 65 minutes and received extremely negative reviews from critics and fans alike.

CineTel Films acquired rights with the remake also titled &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot;, which had a Halloween 2010 worldwide theatrical release. The remake was produced by CineTel president and CEO Paul Hertzberg and Lisa Hansen, with Jeff Klein, Alan Ostroff, Gary Needle and Zarchi as executive producers. Steven R. Monroe directed, with newcomer Sarah Butler starring as Jennifer. The follow-up &quot;I Spit on Your Grave 2&quot; was released on September 20, 2013, starring Jemma Dallender, Joe Absolom, Yavor Baharov, and Aleksandar Alekiov. It was directed by Steven R. Monroe and written by Thomas Fenton and Neil Elman. A second sequel, &quot;I Spit on Your Grave III: Vengeance Is Mine&quot;, arrived in 2015, with Butler reprising her role as Jennifer.

The official sequel &quot;I Spit on Your Grave: Deja Vu&quot;, directed by original director Meir Zarchi, was finished in October 2016 with Camille Keaton reprising her role as Jennifer Hills.

==Home media==
The film received its first Blu-ray release on September 20, 2010, in the United Kingdom from 101 Films. It was released in an &#x27;Ultimate Collector&#x27;s Edition&#x27;, containing the film on both Blu-ray and DVD, a collector&#x27;s booklet, and a poster. At the time it was the most complete version released in the U.K., but it was not uncut - cuts of almost three minutes were required for an &#x27;18&#x27; rating to the rape scenes (previous U.K. releases were cut by over seven minutes). It was also released alongside the remake in a &#x27;Limited Collector&#x27;s Edition&#x27; on February 7, 2011, in the U.K. It was again submitted for U.K. DVD in 2020, and was passed with lesser cuts, this time totaling 1 min. 41 secs. It was released on February 8, 2011, in the United States from Starz/Anchor Bay Entertainment. In Australia, the film was released on March 16, 2011, as a &#x27;Director&#x27;s Cut&#x27; edition. The film was released on 4K UHD on October 26, 2021, followed by another release on Blu-ray and digitally on August 20, 2024.

<text>Obadiah ben Abraham of Bertinoro (; 1445 – 1515), commonly known as &quot;The Bartenura&quot;, was a 15th-century Italian rabbi best known for his popular commentary on the Mishnah. In his later years, he rejuvenated the Jewish community of Jerusalem and became recognised as the spiritual leader of the Jews of his generation.

==Biography==

In an Italian municipal document, his name is recorded as &quot;Maestro Servadio di Habramo da Bertinoro&quot;, with Servadio being a translation of Ovadiah and Habramo a transliteration of Abraham (his father&#x27;s name). He was also known by the Hebrew acronym יר&quot;א (&quot;Yareh&quot;).

Obadiah was a student of Joseph Colon Trabotto and became rabbi in Bertinoro, a town in the modern province of Forlì-Cesena, whence he derived his by-name, and in Castello.

===In Israel===
The desire to visit the Holy Land led him to Jerusalem, and he arrived there on March 25, 1488, having commenced his journey on October 29, 1486. At the time, the Jewish community in Jerusalem was suffering greatly from oppressive levels of taxation, which led to suffering and emigration.

In a letter written to his brother from Jerusalem on 24 August 1489, Obadiah mentions that Jews flock to Jerusalem from Egypt, Damascus, Aleppo, and other places to worship God. During that same year he says that he also met Jews from Aden. He says of himself that he was living in the home of the &quot;nagid&quot;, and that he gives regular sermons in a synagogue twice a month to the Jewish community, in the Hebrew language, and that he was exempt from paying the customary tax assessed to all other Jewish citizens. He succeeded in obtaining a reduction in taxation levels from the government and supported the Jewish poor using his wealth from Italy. On 17 December 1489, he writes that he had moved to Hebron where he found the atmosphere much more conducive and a small Jewish community numbering 20 households who were of a better temperament than those in Jerusalem, and where they lived along one alleyway.

Bertinoro&#x27;s personality, eloquence, and great reputation as a scholar led to his being accepted as the community&#x27;s spiritual head immediately upon his arrival. His first care was to raise the intellectual plane of the community, and for this purpose, he interested the younger generation in the study of the Talmud and rabbinic literature, and he delivered sermons every other Shabbat in Hebrew.

Upon the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492, many exiles settled in Jerusalem, and Bertinoro became their intellectual leader. These Spanish Jews, more educated than the Musta&#x27;arabi Jews of Israel, presented Bertinoro with a site for a yeshiva in Jerusalem, which he founded, centuries after the extinction of the last academy in Israel. The Jews of Egypt and Turkey supported the maintenance of the yeshiva at Bertinoro&#x27;s written solicitation. , the nagid of Egypt, was especially helpful.

In the decade during which Bertinoro thus controlled the best interests of the Jewish community at Jerusalem, a radical change for the better developed. Shortly after his arrival, he had been compelled upon one occasion to dig a grave because the community had provided no one to perform that labour; a few years later, the community enjoyed the benefits of hospitals, charitable relief societies, and similar associations. His reputation spread widely; not only was he accepted as a rabbinical authority, but the Muslim population frequently asked him to decide judicial cases.

He harshly reproved the rabbis for exacting fees for services at weddings and divorces, believing it their duty to perform religious ceremonies without monetary compensation.

==Works==
===Religion===
Bertinoro is best known as the primary commentator of the Mishnah; since its appearance (Venice, 1549) hardly an edition of the Mishnah has been printed without it. The commentary is based mainly on Rashi and Maimonides. Dedicated Mishnah study had been a marginal phenomenon in Jewish communities for many centuries; the few commentaries that were published tended to be limited to the tractates not covered by the Talmud, while Maimonides&#x27; commentary was written in Judeo-Arabic and thus inaccessible to many Jewish communities. Such study grew vastly in popularity in the late 16th century, aided by the spread of Bertinoro&#x27;s accessible Hebrew Mishnah commentary.

Bertinoro also authored a supercommentary upon Rashi&#x27;s Pentateuch commentary. It was later published under the name &quot;Amar Nakeh&quot; (from ); but this title was given by a later printer rather than Bertinoro himself.

Some piyyutim by Bertinoro exist in manuscript.

===Travel===
He also wrote descriptions of his travels; and his letters to his relations in Italy, although intended only as private communications, are of great historical value. Most interesting in these letters is the wealth of information concerning the social and intellectual conditions of the Jews in Greece, Egypt, and Israel. He shows himself not only a close observer, but a conscientious and unprejudiced chronicler. For example, he studied attentively the conditions of the Karaites in Alexandria, and did not hesitate to praise them for the possession of the very virtues which the Rabbanites denied to them, such as generosity and liberality. His description of the Samaritans in Egypt is one of the most valuable and reliable of medieval times.&quot;

<text>&quot;A-1&quot; (SP-1370) was a converted houseboat used by the United States Navy during World War I. She was assigned the section patrol craft number SP-1370.

The &quot;A-1&quot; was built in 1911 by Sillit Buchanan. Early in the war, the houseboat was inspected for possible naval service, and was taken over from F. E. Wright of San Pedro, California on 6 October 1917. The vessel was placed into service for the Navy on 30 December 1917. She operated in the waters of southern California through the end of World War I. Her logs end on 9 December 1918. So far no record of the boat&#x27;s subsequent fate has survived.

<text>Anthony Edward Visconti (born April 24, 1944) is an American record producer, musician and singer. Since the late 1960s, he has worked with an array of performers. His first hit single was T. Rex&#x27;s &quot;Ride a White Swan&quot; in 1970, the first of many hits in collaboration with Marc Bolan. Visconti&#x27;s lengthiest involvement was with David Bowie: intermittently from the production and arrangement of Bowie&#x27;s 1968 single &quot;In the Heat of the Morning&quot; / &quot;London Bye Ta-Ta&quot; to his final album &quot;Blackstar&quot; in 2016, Visconti produced and occasionally performed on many of Bowie&#x27;s albums. Visconti&#x27;s work on &quot;Blackstar&quot; was awarded the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical and his production of Angelique Kidjo&#x27;s &quot;Djin Djin&quot; received the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary World Music Album.

==Early life==
Visconti was born in Brooklyn, New York, to parents of Italian descent. He started to play the ukulele when he was five years old and then learned guitar. He attended New Utrecht High School. Throughout his teenage years Visconti was involved with both a classical brass band (playing tuba) and a traditional orchestra (playing double bass), as well as playing rock-and-roll-oriented guitar, valuable experience that served him well in later years. By the age of 15 he had focused his efforts on playing in local Brooklyn bands.

After leaving school he played guitar in a band called Ricardo &amp; the Latineers in the Catskills; the band also included Artie Butler, later a leading arranger. In 1960 he played his first recording session and over the next few years became one of the leading guitarists in New York nightclubs. He played in lounge acts, including the Ned Harvey Band and the Speedy Garfin Band, before joining a touring version of The Crew-Cuts, where he met his future wife. As Tony and Siegrid, the pair released two singles; the first, &quot;Long Hair,&quot; was a regional hit in New York in 1966, but they could not maintain its success.

==Production==
Visconti then became in-house producer for his publisher, the Richmond Organization. Through this position, in 1968, he met British producer Denny Cordell, who asked him to assist in recordings for successful jazz vocalist Georgie Fame, prompting Visconti to move to London.

One of his first production projects in England was with the British outfit Tyrannosaurus Rex (later to become T. Rex) on their debut album &quot;My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair... But Now They&#x27;re Content to Wear Stars on Their Brows&quot; (1968). This began a relationship with T. Rex that would last for their next eight albums and eleven UK Top Ten singles in a row, commencing with &quot;Ride a White Swan&quot; (1970). One of Visconti&#x27;s greatest successes was &quot;Electric Warrior&quot; (1971), the album that made T. Rex frontman Marc Bolan a superstar and cemented Visconti&#x27;s producing prowess.

More early production work included David Bowie&#x27;s second album (1969) and for the Welsh group The Iveys (later known as Badfinger). He produced several tracks for the Iveys&#x27; first LP, &quot;Maybe Tomorrow&quot; (1969), and &quot;Magic Christian Music&quot; (1970), released on the Beatles&#x27; Apple label.

He produced the first two albums by influential progressive rock band Gentle Giant. Shortly afterwards, Visconti began to work again with Bowie and, along with guitarist Mick Ronson and drummer John Cambridge, formed and toured with the band The Hype, in which he played bass. Although the band name would be very short-lived, most of the line-up persisted and—with Woody Woodmansey replacing Cambridge—would go on to record Bowie&#x27;s album and single &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; in 1970. He would further go on to work on Bowie&#x27;s albums &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; (1974), &quot;Young Americans&quot; (1975), &quot;Low&quot; (1977), &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot; (1977), &quot;Lodger&quot; (1979), &quot;Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)&quot; (1980), &quot;Heathen&quot; (2002), &quot;Reality&quot; (2003), &quot;The Next Day&quot; (2013), and his final album, &quot;Blackstar&quot; (2016).

In late 1970 and early 1971 Visconti produced both the debut and second albums by UK Afrorock pioneers Osibisa. These were 1971’s self titled debut and its follow up Woyaya. Both albums also featured early examples of the artwork of Roger Dean.

Visconti scored the orchestral arrangements for Paul McCartney and Wings&#x27; 1973 album &quot;Band on the Run&quot;. He later produced two albums for the Moody Blues, &quot;The Other Side of Life&quot; (1986) and &quot;Sur La Mer&quot; (1988).
In 1990 he produced several tracks on the Moody Blues&#x27; &quot;Keys of the Kingdom&quot; album (1991), Luscious Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Electric Honey&quot;, &quot;Leisure Noise&quot; by Gay Dad, &quot;Soul Caddy&quot; for Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies, and &quot;Dawn of Ananda&quot; for Annie Haslam. In 1997, Visconti produced the debut album of The Stone Roses member John Squire&#x27;s new band, The Seahorses, entitled &quot;Do It Yourself&quot;. 

He produced and played bass on a handful of tracks from The Dandy Warhols&#x27; 2003 album, &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House&quot;. In 2003 he teamed up with the Finn Brothers (Neil and Tim of Crowded House and Split Enz) to record and produce their second collaborative album, eventually released in 2004. That same year, he produced three songs on the Manic Street Preachers album Lifeblood. In 2005, he collaborated with Copenhagen band Kashmir, whose fifth album, &quot;No Balance Palace&quot;, featured David Bowie. He has also collaborated as co-writer and producer on an album project by Richard Barone. He worked in Rome and produced the No. 1 UK album by Morrissey &quot;Ringleader of the Tormentors&quot;.

His autobiography, &quot;Bowie, Bolan and The Brooklyn Boy&quot;, co-written with Richard Havers, was published in February 2007 by HarperCollins UK. The book has been translated into French by Jérôme Soligny as &quot;Bowie, Bolan et le Gamin de Brooklyn&quot;, published by Tournon.

In 2007 and 2008 Visconti was very active in the studio with Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo, producing her Grammy-winning album &quot;Djin Djin&quot;, which included guest artists Alicia Keys, Peter Gabriel, Joss Stone, Josh Groban, and Carlos Santana. He has also produced and mixed two albums at Saint Claire Recording Studio in Lexington, Kentucky: &quot;The Bright Lights of America&quot; by Pittsburgh punk band Anti-Flag and Alejandro Escovedo&#x27;s album &quot;Real Animal&quot;, released in June 2008. He produced &quot;Le Vent De L&#x27;Hiver&quot; by French artist Raphael in Paris and New York. He produced and mixed the Kristeen Young album &quot;Music for Strippers, Hookers, and the Odd On-Looker&quot;, released in 2009, and arranged the Fall Out Boy album &quot;Folie à Deux&quot;. 2010 marked the release of Richard Barone&#x27;s Visconti-produced &quot;Glow&quot; album, which includes five songs co-written with Barone and a remake of T. Rex&#x27;s &quot;Girl&quot;; he also played bass, guitar, synth, and Stylophone on the album and performed live in concert with Barone on numerous occasions.

Visconti produced the 2013 David Bowie album &quot;The Next Day&quot; and remixed and remastered both &quot;The Slider&quot; anniversary box set and &quot;Electric Warrior&quot; 40th-anniversary box set by T. Rex. In 2013, he produced &quot;Solar Secrets&quot; by Capsula.

In 2014 Visconti produced and arranged several tracks on Marc Almond&#x27;s album &quot;The Dancing Marquis&quot;. Almond had wanted to work with Visconti since hearing some of Visconti&#x27;s earliest production work with T-Rex and David Bowie, stating, &quot;It was a dream to work with Tony&quot;.

From 2016 to 2023 Visconti was a jury member of the ANCHOR-Award, linked to the Reeperbahn Festival.

In 2018 Visconti produced &quot;Evil Spirits&quot; for The Damned, their first album in ten years. He also produced, sang, and played recorder on &quot;Merrie Land&quot;, the second album by The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen (2018).

In 2019 Visconti produced the song &quot;The Dragon Cries&quot; with Band-Maid vocalists Miku Kobato and Saiki Atsumi. The track was released on Band-Maid&#x27;s 2019 release &quot;Conqueror&quot;.

Visconti served as music producer on the 2022 film &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot;, a documentary about Bowie written, produced, directed, and edited by Brett Morgen.

==Personal life==
After divorcing his first wife, Siegrid, Visconti married Welsh folk singer Mary Hopkin in 1971; they divorced in 1981. The pair have two children, musicians Jessica Lee Morgan and Morgan Visconti. In 1989 he married his third wife, May Pang; they had two children before they divorced in 2000. Visconti currently lives with his girlfriend of 20 years, musician Kristeen Young.

==Musician==

Visconti played bass on David Bowie&#x27;s 1970 album &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;. Since 2015 he has toured the UK, Japan, and the US with the Bowie cover band Holy Holy, playing the album in its entirety and other early Bowie classics, along with the album&#x27;s original drummer Mick Woodmansey and other well-known musicians, including singer Glenn Gregory and guitarist James Stevenson. The band have followed this up with later shows in which they perform &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot; album.

<doc id="751768" wikidata="Q5164701" url="?curid=751768" title="Consumer goods in the Soviet Union">
<text>Consumer goods in the Soviet Union were usually produced by a two-category industry. Group A was &quot;heavy industry&quot;, which included all goods that serve as an input required for the production of some other, final good. Group B was &quot;consumer goods&quot;, final goods used for consumption, which included food, clothing and shoes, housing, and such heavy-industry products as appliances and fuels that are used by individual consumers. From the early days of the Stalin era, Group A received top priority in economic planning and allocation so as to industrialize the Soviet Union from its previous agricultural economy.

==The consumer industry and Soviet economic development==

Following the October Revolution of 1917, the economy of the Soviet Union, previously largely agrarian, was rapidly industrialized. From 1928 to 1991 the entire course of the economy was guided by a series of ambitious five-year plans (see Economic planning in the Soviet Union). The nation was among the world&#x27;s three top manufacturers of a large number of basic and heavy industrial products, but it tended to lag behind in the output of light industrial production and consumer durables. One result of this was that consumer demand was only partially satisfied.

==Consumer goods in the early Stalin years (1930s)==

===Introduction of consumer goods===
The 1930s saw major changes in the supply and distribution of consumer goods in the Soviet Union. The first five-year plan focused on the industrialization of the country and the production of industrial goods. After the successful industrialization drive in the first five-year plan, the government turned its focus to improving the lives of its citizens. The introduction of the second five-year plan in 1933 attempted to accomplish this by shifting the focus of production exclusively from industrial goods to include the production of some consumer goods. The Party Congress of February 1934 bolstered the calls for improvement of both quantity and quality in food products and other consumer goods. These changes led Stalin to declare in 1935 that &quot;Life has become more joyous&quot;.

To a Soviet consumer, a luxury item was any good with the exception of plain breads, cabbage, potatoes and vodka. By granting all citizens access to a larger variety of consumer goods, views of consumer goods shifted from representative of the elite, and therefore despised, to being desired by all citizens. This shift in opinion and perception fit into the main Marxist–Leninist goal of empowering the proletariat. The Soviet government looked to teach Soviet citizens about Marxist–Leninist ideology along with table manners and discerning taste in food and material goods. Bolsheviks were expected to be cultured and mannered. Being able to discuss luxury goods with comrades was an important social skill.

The government used consumer items as legitimate awards to honor comrades whose work contributed to the building of socialism. However, the culturalization of society legitimized the formerly despised bourgeois concerns about status and possession, and the practice of giving special goods to a subset of the population also created a new social hierarchy which received special privileges.

===Distribution and supply===
In the early 1930s, the closed distribution system was the primary method of consumer goods distribution. By 1933, two thirds of Moscow&#x27;s population and 58 percent of Leningrad&#x27;s population were served by these stores. The closed distribution system consisted of stores and cafeterias accessible only to workers registered at that enterprise. These centers distributed rationed goods. The system was set up to protect the workers from the worst effects of limited supply and shortages. It also linked the rationing system with employment.

At the same time, there were three other legal alternatives to closed distribution stores: commercial stores, Torgsin stores and Kolkhoz markets. All had higher prices than the closed distribution stores. Since the state controlled all of these distribution methods, it could exercise a distribution monopoly.

The first five-year plan caused the closure of all artisan methods of consumer goods production, such as small private factories and workshops. In the mid-1930s, these methods of production were allowed to return on a small scale. In May 1936, a law was passed that slightly improved the supply of consumer goods by legalizing individual practice of trades such as cobbling, cabinetmaking, carpentry, dressmaking, hairdressing, laundering, locksmithing, photography, plumbing, tailoring, and upholstery – it slightly improved the shortage of consumer goods. Artisanal activity related to food was still banned. Kolkhoz markets were set up for artisans and peasants to sell their homemade goods. The State regulated the amount of participation in these markets but prices were allowed to float. This floating caused the prices at these markets to normally be higher than prices in the closed distribution stores. Individual service was illegal until May 1936.

The State also set up Torgsin stores that sold scarce goods in exchange for foreign currency, gold, silver, and other valuables. The purpose of these stores was to expand Soviet hard currency reserves so that the country could import more equipment for the industrialization drive. Since these goods were scarce, consumers viewed them as treasure and selling them was a huge sacrifice. Prices were kept low to entice people to participate in the Torgsin stores. These stores ran from 1930 to 1936.

From 1929, the State ran commercial stores that functioned outside the rationing system. Goods were sold for higher prices than in the closed distribution stores, two to four times as much. The goods sold were regarded as higher quality than goods sold by the closed distribution stores.

At the end of 1933, the first department store, called the Central Department Store, opened in Moscow. It ran until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 as part of the commercial store network. The end of the first rationing period and the abolition of the closed distribution system in 1935 caused the commercial store network to expand. In January 1935, there were five department stores open in the USSR. A year later, fifteen more department stores had opened.

===Foreign influence===
The import of foreign goods was extremely limited during the 1930s. The official slogan was &quot;There is much to be learned from the example of the advanced capitalist countries in the field of consumer goods&quot;. Small amounts of foreign goods were imported, studied, and then copied. These Soviet versions of foreign consumer goods were distributed through consumption channels. The State did not directly import large quantities of consumer goods.

During the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact period (1939–41), the Soviet citizens&#x27; primary interaction with the outside world was with the newly occupied borderlands of Finland, the Baltic States, Bessarabia, and Poland. Goods considered scarce in the USSR such as watches, bicycles, clothes and food products were plentiful in these regions. The occupying Red Army was fascinated with the diversity of goods at low prices. Viewed as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire them, soldiers bought large quantities of these goods to send back to their families in the USSR. This flow of goods inspired civilians to seek permission to travel to these areas to acquire the goods and sell them on the black market.

==1959 American National Exhibition==
In the summer of 1959 the American National Exhibition was held at Sokolniki Park in Moscow. The American National Exhibition was sponsored by the American government and featured many displays of the latest &quot;home appliances, fashions, television and hi-fi sets, a model house priced to sell [to] an &#x27;average&#x27; family, farm equipment, 1959 automobiles, boats, sporting equipment and a children’s playground.&quot;

<text>The Lisbon Metropolitan Area (; abbreviated as AML) is a metropolitan area in Portugal centered on Lisbon, the capital and largest city of the country. The metropolitan area, covering 17 cities in 18 municipalities, is the largest urban area in the country and the 10th largest in the European Union, with a population in 2023 of 2,961,177 in an area of 3,015.24 km².

The Lisbon Metropolitan Area has the largest GDP (€98.5 billion) of any metropolitan area in Portugal. The region is home to the largest tech hub in the country and a majority of Portugal&#x27;s major multinational corporations by revenue are based there.

== History ==
Portugal has been through a period of administrative changes since the 1974 revolution. More recently, new standards of territorial administration have been implemented to match European Union criteria.

After some years of indefinitions, municipalities are now associated in metropolitan areas or intermunicipal communities. These new regional divisions are colliding with the traditional Portuguese regional structures: &quot;Distritos&quot; (Districts). Districts were implemented in the 19th century by Mouzinho da Silveira after the Liberal Revolution of 1820, to replace clerical dioceses (which held the intermediate authority between the absolute monarchy and the municipalities), and still are the official regional authorities in Portugal, thus leaving the new metropolitan authorities with no authority at all. For instance, the District of Lisbon and the District of Setubal collide and interfere with the Lisbon metropolitan area authority. Each District is ruled by a &quot;governador civil&quot; (civil governor). These governors are empowered by the Prime Minister of Portugal and have most of the administrative power over the municipalities comprised, leaving the metropolitan areas with a passive status and communitarian tasks.

As an administrative entity, the Lisbon metropolitan area was only created in 1991 in order to meet the needs of urban territories with a large population density surrounding the Portuguese capital. 

To definitely end with these anomalies, a national Referendum was held on November 8, 1998, in order to approve a new regionalization, which was rejected by over 60% of the voting population on account of disagreements over the loss of sovereignty of some districts to others (e.g. by the time of the referendum it was not known where the seat of government of the new &quot;Estremadura &amp; Ribatejo&quot; region would be, which was a fusion of the District of Leiria with the District of Santarém, Leiria and Santarém being cities of the same size and importance).

The Regionalization experiment in Portugal was only successful among insular regions like in 1976, when the districts of Angra do Heroísmo, Horta and Ponta Delgada were substituted by the Autonomous Region of Açores with the seat of government being in Ponta Delgada, while the district of Funchal was replaced by the Autonomous Region of Madeira with a seat of government in Funchal.

==Overview==
The Lisbon metropolitan area, centered in the Portuguese capital city of Lisbon, is the largest population concentration in Portugal. The population in 2011 was 2,821,876, of whom 547,733 (19.4%) live in the city of Lisbon. About 26.7% of the total population of Portugal lives in the Lisbon metropolitan area. The area of the Lisbon metropolitan area is 3,015.24 km2, which is 3.3% of the total area of Portugal.

The Lisbon metropolitan area has an active population of about 1.3 million people. With 32.7% of the national employment being located in its territory, the contribution of AML for the gross domestic product surpasses 36%.

Today, the Lisbon metropolitan area territory is almost the same as Lisbon Region territory, being AML a union of metropolitan municipalities, and Lisbon Region a NUTS II region.

It is bordered by the Oeste Intermunicipal Community (Central Region) to the north, Lezíria do Tejo to the northeast, Alentejo Central to the east and by Alentejo Litoral to the south, the former ones belonging to the wider Alentejo region.

The municipalities north of the Tagus River are from Lisbon District (Grande Lisboa); those south of the river are from Setubal District (Península de Setúbal).

==Structure==
The metropolitan area of Lisbon was a semiofficial structure. Recently, Portugal has been incrementing the powers held by these territorial organization organs. In the officialization of the Lisbon Great Metropolitan Area, Azambuja left due to being mostly a rustic zone, more kindred to the city of Santarém which lies just 23 km northeast, while Lisbon is 45 km away from Azambuja, southeast.

In the official AML site is said:

As stated on the law 10/2003, of the 13 of May, the Grande Área Metropolitana de Lisboa (Lisbon Great Metropolitan Area) is a public collective person of associative nature, and of territorial scope that aims to reach common public interests of the municipalities that integrate it, that includes (18 City Halls) – Alcochete, Almada, Barreiro, Cascais, Lisboa, Loures, Mafra, Moita, Montijo, Odivelas, Oeiras, Palmela, Sesimbra, Setúbal, Seixal, Sintra and Vila Franca de Xira.

The Grande Área Metropolitana de Lisboa was constituted, by public scripture, in 2004, and published on 5 July 2004, in the III series of the Diário da República. It is composed by three organs: ·

Junta Metropolitana, executive organ, composed by the 18 presidents of the city halls that it integrates. They elect among themselves, a president and two vice presidents.

Assembleia Metropolitana, legislative organ, composed by the chosen representatives in the municipal assembly of the city halls, in odd number, over the triple the number of the towns that it integrates, in a maximum of 55.

Conselho Metropolitano, consultative organ, composed by representatives of the state and by the members of the Junta Metropolitana.

<doc id="751771" wikidata="Q1128622" url="?curid=751771" title="Distribution board">
<text>A distribution board (also known as panelboard, circuit breaker panel, breaker panel, electric panel, fuse box or DB box) is a component of an electricity supply system that divides an electrical power feed into subsidiary circuits while providing a protective fuse or circuit breaker for each circuit in a common enclosure. Normally, a main switch, and in recent boards, one or more residual-current devices (RCDs) or residual current breakers with overcurrent protection (RCBOs) are also incorporated.

In the United Kingdom, a distribution board designed for domestic installations is known as a consumer unit.

==North America==

North American distribution boards are generally housed in sheet metal enclosures, with the circuit breakers positioned in two columns operable from the front. Some panelboards are provided with a door covering the breaker switch handles, but all are constructed with a &quot;dead front&quot;; that is to say the front of the enclosure (whether it has a door or not) prevents the operator of the circuit breakers from contacting live electrical parts within. Busbars carry the current from incoming line (&quot;hot&quot;) conductors to the breakers, which are secured to the bus with either a &quot;bolt-on&quot; connection (using a threaded screw) or a &quot;plug-in&quot; connection using a retaining clip. &quot;Panelboards&quot; are more common in commercial and industrial applications and employ bolt-on breakers. Residential and light commercial panels are generally referred to as &quot;load centers&quot; and employ plug-in breakers. The neutral conductors are secured to a neutral bus using screw terminals. The branch circuit bonding conductors are secured to a terminal block attached directly to the panelboard enclosure, which is itself grounded.

During servicing of the distribution board, when the cover has been removed and the cables are visible, American panelboards commonly have some live parts exposed. In Canadian service entrance panelboards the main switch or circuit breaker is located in a &quot;service box&quot;, a section of the enclosure separated from the rest of the panelboard, so that when the main switch or breaker is switched off no live parts are exposed when servicing the branch circuits.

===Breaker arrangement===
Breakers are usually arranged in two columns. In a U.S.-style board, breaker positions are numbered left-to-right, along each row from top to bottom. This numbering system is universal with numerous competitive manufacturers of breaker panels.

Each row is fed from a different line (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; below), to allow 2- or 3-pole common-trip breakers to have one pole on each phase. In North America, it is common to wire large permanently installed equipment line-to-line. This takes two slots in the panel (two-pole) and gives a voltage of 240 V for split-phase electric power, or 208 V for three-phase power.

====Interior====

The photograph to the right shows the interior of a residential service panelboard manufactured by General Electric. The three service conductors—two &#x27;hot&#x27; lines and one neutral—can be seen coming in at the top. The neutral wire is connected to the neutral busbar to the left with all the white wires, and the two hot wires are attached to the main breaker. Below the main breaker are the two bus bars carrying the current between the main breaker and the two columns of branch circuit breakers, with each respective circuit&#x27;s red and black hot wires leading off. Three wires (hot black, neutral white, and bare ground) can be seen exiting the left side of the enclosure running directly to a NEMA 5-15 electrical receptacle with a power cord plugged into it. The incoming bare, stranded ground wire can be seen near the bottom of the neutral bus bar.

The photograph on the left shows a dual panel configuration: a main panel on the right (with front cover in place) and a subpanel on the left (with cover removed). The subpanel is fed by two large hot wires and a neutral wire running through the angled conduit near the top of the panels. This configuration appears to display two violations of the current U.S. National Electric Code: the main panel does not have a grounding conductor (here it is fed through the subpanel instead) and the subpanel neutral bar is bonded to the ground bar (these should be separate bars after the first service disconnect, which in this case is the main panel).

===Fuse boxes===
A common design of fuse box that was featured in homes built from 1940 through 1965 was the 60-amp fuse box that included four plug fuses (i.e. the Edison base) for branch circuits and one or more fuse blocks containing cartridge fuses for purposes such as major appliance circuits. After 1965, the more substantial 100 A panel with three-wire (230 V) service became common; a fuse box could have fuse blocks for the main shut-off and an electric range circuit plus a number of plug fuses (Edison base or Type S) for individual circuits.

==United Kingdom==

This picture shows the interior of a typical distribution panel in the United Kingdom. The three incoming phase wires connect to the busbars via a main switch in the centre of the panel. On each side of the panel are two busbars, for neutral and earth. The incoming neutral connects to the lower busbar on the right side of the panel, which is in turn connected to the neutral busbar at the top left. The incoming earth wire connects to the lower busbar on the left side of the panel, which is in turn connected to the earth busbar at the top right. The cover has been removed from the lower-right neutral bar; the neutral bar on the left side has its cover in place.

Down the left side of the phase busbars are two two-pole RCBOs and two single-pole breakers, one unused. The two-pole RCBOs in the picture are not connected across two phases, but have supply-side neutral connections exiting behind the phase busbars. Down the right side of the busbars are a single-pole breaker, a two-pole RCBO and a three-pole breaker.

The illustrated panel includes a great deal of unused space; it is likely that the manufacturer produces 18- and 24-position versions of this panel using the same chassis.

Larger commercial, public, and industrial installations generally use three-phase supplies, with distribution boards which have twin vertical rows of breakers. Larger installations will often use subsidiary distribution boards.

In both cases, modern boards handling supplies up to around 100 A (CUs) or 200 A (distribution boards) use circuit breakers and RCDs on DIN rail mountings. The main distribution board in an installation will also normally provide a main switch (known as an &quot;incomer&quot;) which switches the phase and neutral lines for the whole supply. (n.b., an incomer may be referred to, or sold as, an &quot;isolator&quot;, but this is problematic, as it will not necessarily be used as an isolator in the strict sense.)

For each phase, power is fed along a busbar. In split-phase panels, separate busbars are fed directly from the incomer, which allows RCDs to be used to protect groups of circuits. Alternatively RCBOs may be used to provide both overcurrent and residual-current protection to single circuits.

Other devices, such as transformers (e.g. for bell circuits) and contactors (relays; e.g. for large motor or heating loads) may also be used.

New British distribution boards generally have the live parts enclosed to IP2X, even when the cover has been removed for servicing.

===Consumer units===
In the United Kingdom, BS 7671 defines a consumer unit as &quot;A particular type of distribution board comprising a type tested coordinated assembly for the control and distribution of electrical energy, principally in domestic premises...&quot; These installations usually have single-phase supplies at 230 V (nominal standard); historically, they were known as fuse boxes, as older consumer units used fuses until the advent of mini-circuit breakers (MCBs).
A normal new domestic CU used as a main panel might have from 6 to 24 ways for devices (some of which might occupy two ways), and will be split into two or more sections (e.g. a non-RCD section for alarms etc., an RCD-protected section for socket outlets, and an RCD-protected section for lighting and other built-in appliances). Secondary CUs used for outbuildings usually have 1 to 4 ways plus an RCD.

Recent (pre-17th edition wiring regulations) CUs would not normally have RCD protected sections for anything other than socket outlets, though some older CUs featured RCD incomers. Before 1990, RCDs (and split busbars) were not standard in CUs.
Fuse boxes normally use cartridge or rewirable fuses with no other protective device, and basic 4-ways boxes are very common. Some older boxes are made of brown-black bakelite, sometimes with a wooden base. Although their design is historic, these were standard equipment for new installs as recently as the 1980s, so they are very common. Fuseholders in these boxes may not provide protection from accidental contact with live terminals.

==== Examples ====
In the UK, consumer units (CU) have evolved from basic main switch and rewireable fuses, that afforded only overload and short circuit protection, into sophisticated control units housing many safety features that can protect against different types of electrical fault. The choice of circuit protective device will depend upon the type of electrical circuit it is protecting and what level of protection needs to be afforded. BS7671:2018 Requirements for Electrical Installations, also referred to as the IET Wiring Regulations, gets regularly updated and its latest edition at the time of writing is amendment 2:2022 released on 28 March 2022.
Typical configurations of CU:
* Main switch consumer unit - Consists of a main switch that will disconnect power to all circuits simultaneously which has one busbar linking all protective devices to a common live source, and one neutral conductor or link bar connecting to a common neutral rail. There will be a separate earth rail to allow the main earth conductor to be connected. This example offers the highest degree of circuit separation as all circuits are independent. This particular example amay not be suitable as a standalone solution with only overload and short circuit protection MCBs for each circuit. Additional protection from earth leakage RCBOs faults and arc faults AFDD may be required by BS7671 making this an expensive solution.
* Main Switch and Dual RCD consumer unit - Consists of a main switch that will disconnect power to all circuits simultaneously and two 30mA RCDs RCDs each with its own live busbar each protecting a separate bank of circuits, typically half-and-half but other combinations are available, from earth leakage faults. Offers a cost-effective solution by using a combination of cheaper mcbs and only two, more expensive, RCDs. 
* High integrity consumer unit - Consists of a main switch that will disconnect power to all circuits simultaneously and three separate live busbars, one linked directly to the main switch and two others on each main RCD. The live busbar on the main switch allows the use of mcbs only where more sensitive devices such as RCBOs and AFDDs would not be appropriate, or the independent use of RCBOs, and may be limited to only one or two ways. The remainder of the circuits are divided in the same way as a dual RCD CU. This type of consumer unit offers improved circuit separation over a dual RCD CU whilst allowing for more flexibility.
* RCD incomer consumer unit - This is the least convenient solution in terms of circuit separation because the main switch is an RCD. Less common than the other types, it is no longer considered a standalone solution because power to all circuits is lost in the event of an earth fault causing the main switch RCD to activate.

Modern consumer units are now required to be metal (non-combustible) and usually use DIN rail mounted devices. The DIN rail is standardized but the busbar arrangements are not. Mixing of different brands devices is against the manufacturers requirements and should generally be avoided.

The choice of consumer unit will reflect several factors such as the size and layout of the dwelling, number of floors, outbuildings, the expected loads (lighting, sockets, ovens, showers, immersion heaters, car-chargers etc.), and how much protection is required for each circuit.

The box pictured top-right is a &quot;Wylex standard&quot; fitted with rewirable fuses. These boxes can also be fitted with cartridge fuses or miniature circuit breakers (MCBs). This type of consumer unit was very popular in Britain until 2001 when wiring regulations mandated residual-current device (RCD) protection for sockets that could &quot;reasonably be expected to&quot; supply outdoor equipment (BS 7671:2001, ). There were a number of similar designs from other manufacturers but the Wylex ones are by far the most commonly encountered and the only ones for which fuseholders/breakers are still commonly available.

Some manufacturers have added innovative features such as CPN Cudis who have added a LED strip light to their &#x27;Lumo&#x27; consumer unit to enhance visibility in dark locations such as under staircases.

==== RCD protection types ====
Since the introduction of (BS 7671:2008 incorporating amendment no 1: 2011) 17th Edition IET Wiring Regulations, consumer units in the UK must provide RCD protection to all cables embedded in walls excepting high integrity circuits such as those for burglar alarms or smoke alarms.

Consumer units have different methods of protecting circuits. For example, a dual split-load consumer unit can be arranged in a two-story dwelling as follows:

RCD 1

*Upstairs Lights,
*Downstairs Ring Final,
*Garage Sockets,
*Cooker

RCD 2

*Downstairs Lights,
*Upstairs Sockets,
*Shower,
*Heating

By arranging the circuits like this, power will still be present on one of the floors if only one RCD trips out. Moreover, having sockets and lights on alternate RCD&#x27;s means that if a faulty kettle downstairs trips that RCD for example, the kitchen lights will still be available, avoiding the hazard of investigating the fault in darkness.

Another way to protect circuits under the 17th Edition IET Wiring Regulations is by fitting Residual Current Circuit Breaker With Overload (RCBOs) to every circuit, and although this is more costly than the RCD+MCB&#x27;s option, it means any fault condition on a circuit trips only that circuit&#x27;s RCBO, so the search for the fault is narrowed down from the start. When an electrician must be called out, this localised fault can be resolved faster (and therefore cheaper) in contrast with the RCD+MCB&#x27;s arrangement, which only indicates a fault somewhere within that RCD&#x27;s set of circuits.

Some older systems such as those that use MK or old MEM Consumer Units that had one fuse per spur, so for instance:

*Upstairs Lights Fuse 1
*Upstairs Sockets Fuse 2
*Downstairs Lights Fuse 3
*Downstairs Sockets Fuse 4
etc..

===Legacy fuseboxes===
A small number of pre-1950 fuseboxes are still in service. These should be treated with caution because exposed live parts are common on these boxes. The installations they supply will not meet modern standards for electrical safety. Another characteristic of very old installations is that there may be two fuses for each circuit; one on the live and one on the neutral. In rare instances, old ring circuits may be encountered with no fewer than 4 15 A fuses per ring, one on each of L and N, and this duplicated for each of the two feeds for the ring.

==Manufacturer differences==
Despite the adoption of a standard DIN rail for mounting and a standard cut-out shape for seemingly interchangeable breakers, the positions of busbar connections and other features are not standardized. Each manufacturer has one or more &quot;systems&quot;, or kinds of breaker panels, that is only fully compatible with breakers of that type. These assemblies have been tested and approved for use by a recognized authority. Replacing or adding equipment which &quot;just happens to fit&quot; can result in unexpected or even dangerous conditions. Such installations should not be done without first consulting knowledgeable sources, including manufacturers&#x27; datasheets.

==Location and designation==
For reasons of aesthetics and security, domestic circuit breaker panels and consumer units are normally located in out-of-the-way closets, attics, garages, or basements, but sometimes they are also featured as part of the aesthetic elements of a building (as an art installation, for example) or where they can be easily accessible. However, current U.S. building codes prohibit installation of a panel in a bathroom (or similar room), in closets intended for clothing, or where there is insufficient space for an electrician to gain access to the panel. Specific situations, such as an installation outdoors, in a hazardous environment, or in other out-of-the-ordinary locations might require specialized equipment and more stringent installation practices.

Distribution boards may be designated for three phase or single phase and normal power or emergency power, or designated by use such as distribution panels for supplying other panels, lighting panels for lights, power panels for equipment and receptacles and special uses. Panels are located throughout the building in electric closets serving a section of the building.

==Theatre lighting==
In a theatre, a specialty panel known as a &quot;dimmer rack&quot; is used to feed stage lighting instruments. A U.S. style dimmer rack has a 208Y/120 volt 3-phase feed. Instead of just circuit breakers, the rack has a solid state electronic dimmer with its own circuit breaker for each stage circuit. This is known as a &quot;dimmer-per-circuit&quot; arrangement. The dimmers are equally divided across the three incoming phases. In a 96 dimmer rack, there are 32 dimmers on phase A, 32 dimmers on phase B, and 32 on phase C to spread out the lighting load as equally as possible. In addition to the power feed from the supply transformer in the building, a control cable from the lighting desk carries information to the dimmers in a control protocol such as DMX-512. The information includes lighting level information for each channel, by which it controls which dimmer circuits come up and go out during the lighting changes of the show (light cues), and over what fade time.

Distribution boards may be surface-mounted or flush. The former arrangement provides easier alteration or addition to wiring at a later date, but the latter arrangement might be neater, particularly for a residential application. The other problem with recessing a distribution board into a wall is that if the wall is solid, a lot of brick or block might need to be removed—generally for this reason, recessed boards would only be installed on new-build projects when the required space can be built into the wall.

<text>The Francis turbine is a type of water turbine. It is an inward-flow reaction turbine that combines radial and axial flow concepts. Francis turbines are the most common water turbine in use today, and can achieve over 95% efficiency.

The process of arriving at the modern Francis runner design took from 1848 to approximately 1920. It became known as the Francis turbine around 1920, being named after British-American engineer James B. Francis who in 1848 created a new turbine design.
Francis turbines are primarily used for producing electricity. The power output of the electric generators generally ranges from just a few kilowatts up to 1000 MW, though mini-hydro installations may be lower. The best performance is seen when the head height is between . Penstock diameters are between . The speeds of different turbine units range from 70 to 1000 rpm. A wicket gate around the outside of the turbine&#x27;s rotating runner controls the rate of water flow through the turbine for different power production rates. Francis turbines are usually mounted with a vertical shaft, to isolate water from the generator. This also facilitates installation and maintenance.

==Development==

Water wheels of different types have been used for more than 1,000 years to power mills of all types, but they were relatively inefficient. Nineteenth-century efficiency improvements of water turbines allowed them to replace nearly all water wheel applications and compete with steam engines wherever water power was available. After electric generators were developed in the late 1800s, turbines were a natural source of generator power where potential hydropower sources existed.

In 1826 the French engineer Benoit Fourneyron developed a high-efficiency (80%) outward-flow water turbine. Water was directed tangentially through the turbine runner, causing it to spin. Another French engineer, Jean-Victor Poncelet, designed an inward-flow turbine in about 1820 that used the same principles. S. B. Howd obtained a US patent in 1838 for a similar design.

In 1848 James B. Francis, while working as head engineer of the Locks and Canals company in the water wheel-powered textile factory city of Lowell, Massachusetts, improved on these designs to create more efficient turbines. He applied scientific principles and testing methods to produce a very efficient turbine design. More importantly, his mathematical and graphical calculation methods improved turbine design and engineering. His analytical methods allowed the design of high-efficiency turbines to precisely match a site&#x27;s water flow and pressure (water head).

==Components==
A Francis turbine consists of the following main parts:

Spiral casing: The spiral casing around the runner of the turbine is known as the volute casing or scroll case. Throughout its length, it has numerous openings at regular intervals to allow the working fluid to impinge on the blades of the runner. These openings convert the pressure energy of the fluid into kinetic energy just before the fluid impinges on the blades. This maintains a constant velocity despite the fact that numerous openings have been provided for the fluid to enter the blades, as the cross-sectional area of this casing decreases uniformly along the circumference.

Guide and stay vanes: The primary function of the guide and stay vanes is to convert the pressure energy of the fluid into kinetic energy. It also serves to direct the flow at design angles to the runner blades.

Runner blades: Runner blades are the heart of any turbine. These are the centers where the fluid strikes and the tangential force of the impact produces torque causing the shaft of the turbine to rotate. Close attention to design of blade angles at inlet and outlet is necessary, as these are major parameters affecting power production.

Draft tube: The draft tube is a conduit that connects the runner exit to the tail race where the water is discharged from the turbine. Its primary function is to reduce the velocity of discharged water to minimize the loss of kinetic energy at the outlet. This permits the turbine to be set above the tail water without appreciable drop of available head.

==Theory of operation==

The Francis turbine is a type of reaction turbine, a category of turbine in which the working fluid comes to the turbine under immense pressure and the energy is extracted by the turbine blades from the working fluid. A part of the energy is given up by the fluid because of pressure changes occurring on the blades of the turbine, quantified by the expression of degree of reaction, while the remaining part of the energy is extracted by the volute casing of the turbine. At the exit, water acts on the spinning cup-shaped runner features, leaving at low velocity and low swirl with very little kinetic or potential energy left. The turbine&#x27;s exit tube is shaped to help decelerate the water flow and recover the pressure.

==Blade efficiency==
Usually the flow velocity (velocity perpendicular to the tangential direction) remains constant throughout, i.e. and is equal to that at the inlet to the draft tube. Using the Euler turbine equation,
, where &quot;e&quot; is the energy transfer to the rotor per unit mass of the fluid. From the inlet velocity triangle,

:formula_1
and 
:formula_2
Therefore
:formula_3

The loss of kinetic energy per unit mass at the outlet is . Therefore, neglecting friction, the blade efficiency becomes

:formula_4
i.e.
:formula_5

==Degree of reaction==

Degree of reaction can be defined as the ratio of pressure energy change in the blades to total energy change of the fluid. This means that it is a ratio indicating the fraction of total change in fluid pressure energy occurring in the blades of the turbine. The rest of the changes occur in the stator blades of the turbines and the volute casing as it has a varying cross-sectional area. For example, if the degree of reaction is given as 50%, that means that half of the total energy change of the fluid is taking place in the rotor blades and the other half is occurring in the stator blades. If the degree of reaction is zero it means that the energy changes due to the rotor blades is zero, leading to a different turbine design called the Pelton Turbine.

:formula_6

The second equality above holds, since discharge is radial in a Francis turbine. Now, putting in the value of &#x27;e&#x27; from above and using formula_7 (as formula_8)

:formula_9

==Application==

Francis turbines may be designed for a wide range of heads and flows. This versatility, along with their high efficiency, has made them the most widely used turbine in the world. Francis type units cover a head range from , and their connected generator output power varies from just a few kilowatts up to 1000 MW. Large Francis turbines are individually designed for each site to operate with the given water flow and water head at the highest possible efficiency, typically over 90% (to 99%).

In contrast to the Pelton turbine, the Francis turbine operates at its best completely filled with water at all times. The turbine and the outlet channel may be placed lower than the lake or sea level outside, reducing the tendency for cavitation.

In addition to electrical production, they may also be used for pumped storage, where a reservoir is filled by the turbine (acting as a pump) driven by the generator acting as a large electrical motor during periods of low power demand, and then reversed and used to generate power during peak demand. These pump storage reservoirs act as large energy storage sources to store &quot;excess&quot; electrical energy in the form of water in elevated reservoirs. This is one of a few methods that allow temporary excess electrical capacity to be stored for later utilization.

<text>Gregory James Nickels (born August 7, 1955) is an American politician who served as the 51st mayor of Seattle, Washington. He took office on January 1, 2002, and was reelected to a second term in 2005. In August 2009, Nickels finished third in the primary election for Seattle mayor, failing to qualify for the November 2009 general election, and losing his bid for a third term as mayor. He left office on January 1, 2010.

==Early life and education==
Nickels, the oldest of six siblings, was born in Chicago to Bob and Kathie Nickels. In 1961, his family moved to Seattle, where he graduated from St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Primary School and the Jesuit Seattle Preparatory School. He attended the University of Washington but left before graduating to pursue his passion for politics.

==Career==

Nickels was legislative assistant to Seattle City Council member and future mayor Norm Rice from 1979 to 1987. Nickels was elected to the King County Council in 1987, defeating longtime incumbent Bob Grieve, and reelected in 1991, 1995 and 1999. In 2001, he was elected Mayor of Seattle (defeating Seattle City Attorney Mark Sidran) and was re-elected in 2005. Nickels ran for a third term in 2009, but he failed to advance to the general election after coming in third place in the primary election held in August 2009. He had several notable events during his tenure as mayor of Seattle. In 2003, he helped to break ground for the Sound Transit Link light rail project in November, and signed an executive order in 2004 giving equal rights to everyone who is married and works for Seattle city government regardless of sexual orientation.

Nickels&#x27; popularity began to decline in July 2008, when the Seattle SuperSonics NBA franchise relocated to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma after a lawsuit against the team&#x27;s ownership group was settled out of court – an outcome in which Nickels&#x27; administration, as well as Washington State lawmakers were faulted by many Seattle sports fans for not doing enough to keep the team in Seattle.

In December 2008, Nickels was criticized after an unusual snowstorm blanketed the city with the greatest snowfalls it had seen since 1996. The Seattle &quot;snowpack&quot;, which began accumulating on December 13, did not melt until December 27, the longest period of time snow had remained on the ground in Seattle since the mid-1980s. Seattle did not use salt to clear its roads, citing environmental concerns, which led to severe problems with the city&#x27;s public transit system.

Due to disapproval of Nickels&#x27; handling of illegal tent cities in Seattle, a tent city community in the Seattle area was known colloquially as &quot;Nickelsville&quot;.

A late 2008 poll of likely Seattle voters reflected dissatisfaction with the incumbent mayor, showing that 31% approved of Nickels&#x27;s performance as mayor while 57% disapproved. Nickels&#x27; low popularity numbers did not recover by August 2009, when he was defeated in the primary election in his bid for a third term as Seattle&#x27;s mayor. In Nickels&#x27; concession defeat, he thanked Seattle voters and noted, &quot;Twice they gave me the honor of doing this. They want a new generation of leadership.&quot;

Shortly before his defeat in his re-election campaign he had been appointed the 67th President of the United States Conference of Mayors earlier in 2009. With his defeat Elizabeth Kautz filled the remainder of his term until 2010. Nickels left Seattle to pursue a teaching position at Harvard University.

In 2012, Nickels ran for Washington Secretary of State as a Democrat. He received 15.85% for third place in the August 7 top-two primary, behind Kathleen Drew (D) and Kim Wyman (R).

==Affiliations==

Nickels is a member of the Washington State Democratic Party and served as the President of the United States Conference of Mayors, but left that post on the day he left office as Seattle mayor. Nickels served on the board of directors of Sound Transit. Since 2003, he has also been the chair of the Transportation and Communications Committee of the U.S. Conference of Mayors and served on the Conference&#x27;s Board of Trustees.

Nickels is a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, a bi-partisan group with a stated goal of &quot;making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets.&quot; The Coalition is co-chaired by former Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

He was the key negotiator for the City of Seattle in accepting $45 million up front from the Bennett Group to move the Seattle SuperSonics of the NBA to Oklahoma City.

==Environmental record==

In 2005, Nickels announced an &quot;Environmental Action Agenda&quot; with the goal of protecting air quality and public health. The primary goal of the agenda is to reduce Seattle&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions &quot;to meet or beat&quot; the levels stipulated in the Kyoto protocols. Nickels spearheaded the US Mayors Climate Protection Agreement, an accord between over 600 US cities committed to reducing greenhouse emissions. Nickels won the 2006 Climate Protection Award from the Environmental Protection Agency, the 2006 Edgar Wayburn Award for Environmental leadership from the National Sierra Club, and the 2006 National Conservation Achievement Award from the National Wildlife Federation.

<text>The Central Contra Costa Sanitary District (CCCSD), also called Central San, provides sanitary sewage transport and treatment for the central portion of Contra Costa County, California. The main facility is a per day treatment plant in residential Martinez, California and it provides service to approx 462,000 residents. It operates and maintains of sewer lines out of its second location in Walnut Creek, California. It is a California Energy Commission Showcase Plant.

==A Brief History==

In the 1940s, central Contra Costa County was a rural area of farms, orchards and a few small towns. With the end of World War II, a building boom began. As the nearby cities of San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley grew, so did the population of Contra Costa County. This ultimately resulted in a sanitation crisis with most of the county depending on septic systems, often inefficient due to the area&#x27;s heavy adobe clay soil. At the time, State health authorities considered the polluted conditions arising from those septic tanks to be among the worst in California.

With septic tanks overflowing and waterborne diseases such as typhoid becoming a potential threat, civic leaders rallied public support for a solution. In an election held on June 24, 1946, a proposal to form a sanitary district for areas of central Contra Costa County was approved. On July 15, 1946, the County Board of Supervisors passed a resolution officially creating the Central Contra Costa Sanitary District (CCCSD).

Board Members attended a groundbreaking ceremony on November 10, 1947, to mark Central San&#x27;s first construction—the main trunk sewer at the east end of Moraga Boulevard. Work began immediately and within 26 months, CCCSD&#x27;s newly constructed main sewer trunk line and treatment plant were operational. At that time, CCCSD&#x27;s service area population was 15,000; the treatment plant&#x27;s capacity was per day; and the CCCSD&#x27;s collection system consisted of of sewer pipe.

That original system was expected to handle the area&#x27;s wastewater for at least two decades. But by 1952, it was obvious that demand would soon exceed capacity. CCCSD began a series of expansions and improvements to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population.

Enormous changes have occurred since the District&#x27;s beginnings in 1946 as a small agency serving a rural area: the size, population, and characteristics of the service area; the processes and technologies used to treat and collect wastewater; the environmental awareness and stricter water quality standards and regulations.

CCCSD is one of the largest sewage plants to use ultraviolet disinfection. Its facilities include a cogeneration system, two multiple hearth furnaces for dried sludge incineration, and a recycled water plant.

<doc id="751787" wikidata="Q387755" url="?curid=751787" title="Soapnet">
<text>Soapnet was an American basic cable network owned by the Disney–ABC Television Group division of The Walt Disney Company.

The network&#x27;s programming was oriented towards the soap opera genre; on launch, Soapnet carried primetime encores of ABC&#x27;s current soaps, as well as reruns of classic daytime and primetime soap opera series. Soapnet also broadcast programming related to soap operas, including news and behind-the-scenes programs. In later years, Soapnet increased its focus on acquired reruns of drama series.

Due in part to a general decline in the soap opera genre as a whole, and the growing adoption of digital video recorders, cable/satellite video on demand, and streaming video options making its primetime soap encores increasingly unnecessary on a traditional linear network, Disney announced in 2010 that Soapnet would be replaced by the new preschool-oriented network Disney Junior, which launched on March 23, 2012. While some providers removed Soapnet upon the launch of Disney Junior, the channel continued to operate on some providers until it finally closed on December 31, 2013.

==History==
===Early history (2000–02)===
When Soapnet launched on January 20, 2000, the channel aired only current ABC soap operas in the evening and early morning, so that people who were at work or school during the day could watch them at their convenience. Programming was inclusive, as the channel was owned by ABC. Soapnet eventually gained high cable carriage due to Disney&#x27;s aggressive policy of pulling ABC-owned broadcast stations and the popular ESPN channels from cable providers if they did not agree to carry Soapnet as well. This was the main reason for ABC owned-and-operated station WABC-TV being pulled from Time Warner Cable&#x27;s New York City system for two days in May 2000.

When Soapnet was announced, Sony Pictures Entertainment planned to launch a competing cable channel and website called SoapCity, which would air all CBS soap operas and the Sony-owned/produced NBC soap &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. The plans for the SoapCity cable channel were abandoned early in 2000 after Sony failed to secure cable carriage, though the website component remained.

Soapnet&#x27;s inaugural lineup aired current soaps such as &quot;All My Children&quot;, &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, &quot;General Hospital&quot; and &quot;Port Charles&quot;, along with canceled daytime and nighttime soaps such as &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, &quot;The Colbys&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;Sisters&quot;, and &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;. As the years went on, Soapnet introduced original programming such as &quot;Soap Center&quot; and &quot;Soap Talk&quot;, the latter of which was nominated for several Daytime Emmy Awards. &quot;Soap Center&quot;, which debuted on Soapnet&#x27;s launch day schedule, was initially hosted by former soap stars Brooke Alexander and David Forsyth. They were replaced the following year by Peggy Bunker: based on the East Coast and covering New York-based soaps; and Tanika Ray discussing West Coast-based soaps. Peggy Bunker also hosted all events from Super Soap Weekend from Walt Disney World in Florida, including an exclusive interview with Susan Lucci. By 2003, the show ceased filming original material.

Other original series included &quot;1 Day With&quot;, a half-hour program featuring interviews with soap actors, that was hosted by &quot;General Hospital&quot; actor Wally Kurth; &quot;I Wanna Be a Soap Star&quot;, a recurring reality series in which twelve young actors compete for a contract role on a daytime soap; and &quot;Soapography&quot;, a 30-minute show profiling the lives and current shows of two different soap opera actors.

===Programming expansion (2002–10)===
In 2002, Soapnet began airing reruns of &quot;Dynasty&quot;, and by 2003, the channel added highly requested programming such as reruns of &quot;Another World&quot; and &quot;Dallas&quot;; replacing &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, &quot;The Colbys&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, and &quot;Sisters&quot;. In 2004, Soapnet acquired the rights to broadcast &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; episodes on a same-day basis. The channel also aired the 1975 to 1981 episodes of &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;, which had not been seen on television since its 1989 cancellation by ABC. At that time, many viewers who did not have Soapnet at its inception petitioned to have the channel broadcast the show from the very beginning. In 2003, the channel aired the first episodes starting on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day.

In 2004, Soapnet acquired reruns of the short-lived 1980s soap &quot;Paper Dolls&quot;. In January 2005, the channel began airing reruns of the Fox dramas &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; and &quot;Melrose Place&quot;; this was followed that spring with the addition of repeats of short-lived nighttime soaps &quot;The Monroes&quot; and &quot;Skin&quot;. In July 2005, it picked up the Fox primetime soap &quot;Pasadena&quot;, including nine episodes that were not aired during the show&#x27;s initial run. On March 16, 2006, Soapnet announced that it had acquired the rights to broadcast same-day episodes of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, which began airing on Soapnet on April 24, 2006 – making it the first CBS network soap to air on the channel.

Since the channel was a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, it also broadcast events from the annual ABC Super Soap Weekend, which was held every November at Walt Disney World, and each summer at Disney&#x27;s California Adventure until the event was discontinued in 2010. &quot;Soap Talk&quot; hosts Lisa Rinna and Ty Treadway served as hosts for question and answer sessions at the events, allowing fans to ask questions to their favorite soap stars.

Some viewers complained about what they viewed as an overabundance of prime-time programming on the channel, some of which (&quot;90210&quot; and &quot;Melrose Place&quot;) had ended their original broadcast runs only a few years prior and had been repeated in syndication on other networks. These fans also objected to the large number of new episodes of the ABC lineup and &quot;Days of our Lives&quot;, and repeatedly requested rebroadcasts of old daytime soaps such as &quot;Loving&quot;, &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;, and &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;.

On February 7, 2007, Soapnet acquired the rights to air reruns of &quot;The O.C.&quot; and &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;. The syndication deal also gave Soapnet an option to order a fifth season of &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; to air on the channel in the event that The CW chose not to renew the show (this option was never exercised as first-run episodes of &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; remained on The CW until the series ended in 2012).

In November 2007, Deborah Blackwell stepped down as general manager of the channel with then-ABC Daytime president Brian Frons assuming her duties. In August 2008, it was revealed that Soapnet had lost the broadcast rights for both &quot;Dallas&quot; and &quot;Melrose Place&quot;; both shows left the schedule that September.

In 2009, the channel started to further expand its acquired programming; and began airing &quot;Greg Behrendt&#x27;s Wake Up Call&quot;, a program that was originally set to air on ABC during the 2006–07 season. After airing the CBC Television series &quot;MVP&quot; (which was canceled by the CBC due to low ratings) in 2008, Soapnet also acquired the rights for the American broadcast of the Canadian dramedy &quot;Being Erica&quot; (which began in January of that year on the CBC) beginning in February 2009. According to Nielsen Media Research, Soapnet was available to 75,259,000 cable and satellite subscribers in December 2010, an increase of 4 million subscribers from May 2009.

===Decline and transition to Disney Junior (2010–13)===
Due to declining viewership in the genre, the Big Three networks had begun to cancel selected soaps and replace them with less-expensive talk show and game show programming, including ABC&#x27;s &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (an attempt to license the two soaps to Prospect Park to continue them as internet television series in 2013 was discontinued after a few months due to production and licensing conflicts), which were replaced with the cooking show &quot;The Chew&quot; (which aired until June 2018) and the lifestyle talk show &quot;The Revolution&quot; (which was canceled in April 2012 due to low ratings; its timeslot was assumed by &quot;General Hospital&quot; and the remaining hour given back to ABC&#x27;s affiliates). The decreasing number of active soaps, as well as the growing adoption of digital video recorders (which made it more convenient to record multiple soaps), along with cable and Internet video on demand options caching episodes online within a matter of hours, negated the further need for a linear channel devoted to the genre.

Disney–ABC Television Group head Anne Sweeney solicited concepts for a new network to replace Soapnet. The ABC Daytime division pitched two concepts for a women-focused network, including &quot;Carrie&quot; (named after Carrie Bradshaw of &quot;Sex and the City&quot;)—a &quot;hip and cool&quot; channel, and &quot;Disney Moms&quot;—which focused on &quot;[programs] moms would want to watch and their families would watch with them&quot;. They competed with a proposal by Disney Channels Worldwide for a network devoted to preschool programming. Much to the dismay of the ABC Daytime staff, Sweeney would choose Disney Channel&#x27;s proposal.

On May 26, 2010, Disney Junior was officially announced as Disney Channels Worldwide&#x27;s new preschool television brand. Replacing Playhouse Disney, Disney Junior would launch as a block on Disney Channel on February 14, 2011, and was to launch a 24-hour cable channel in January 2012, replacing Soapnet. On July 28, 2011, due to issues in reaching carriage deals for the new network, the launch of the Disney Junior channel was delayed to an unspecified date in early 2012. Disney Junior&#x27;s launch date was later set to March 23, 2012. Disney also stated that on some providers, Disney Junior would be carried in parallel with Soapnet until the network is eventually phased out. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that some television providers had been hesitant to immediately drop Soapnet, as they &quot;didn&#x27;t want to risk legions of vocal soap opera fans getting into a lather, or worse, moving to a rival service.&quot;

On March 1, 2012, Soapnet&#x27;s operations were taken over by ABC Family following the dismantling of the ABC Daytime corporate structure under Brian Frons, who had resigned in December 2011.

Some television providers, including certain Xfinity systems, immediately replaced Soapnet with Disney Junior in its channel space on launch. Soapnet continued to be carried on providers who had not yet made carriage agreements for Disney Junior (such as Dish Network), as well as for certain providers that retained Soapnet as part of their channel lineups, while also adding Disney Junior as an additional channel (such as Cablevision, DirecTV, Verizon FiOS, RCN. and Time Warner Cable). Same day rebroadcasts of &quot;General Hospital&quot;, &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; and &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; were retained, with repeats of ABC Family programming and reruns of &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; being added to the schedule. The rights to &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; were transferred to Pivot when that network launched in August 2013.

A 1-hour two-week Live Well Network block was broadcast on Soapnet weeknights from 11 PM to 12 AM (ET/PT) starting on July 30, 2012 through Friday, August 10, 2012.

On January 15, 2013, AT&amp;T U-verse reached a new wide-ranging multi-year carriage agreement with Disney for its various broadcast and cable channels, which included the addition of Disney Junior. In April 2013, Soapnet lost the rights to same-day broadcasts of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; to TVGN (which CBS Corporation, owner of the show&#x27;s originating broadcaster CBS, had acquired a 50% ownership stake in the previous month), effective July 1. TVGN eventually picked up &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; after Soapnet ended, a soap never carried by the network, and both are now carried in high definition on Pop&#x27;s HD simulcast network, along with eventually, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.

In November 2013, Disney announced that Soapnet would close on December 31, 2013, after 13 years of soapy drama. The network&#x27;s impending discontinuation had been previously reported by several cable providers, including AT&amp;T U-verse, Comcast, Charter and Cox, among others. Soapnet quietly went dark shortly before midnight ET on January 1, 2014, without ceremony.

==Programming==

Prior to the switch to an automated schedule, repeats of current soap operas made up the majority of Soapnet&#x27;s daily schedule; the channel usually aired daily episodes of network soaps it had carried (the previous weekday&#x27;s broadcasts airing weekday mornings from 6:00 to 11:00 a.m. ET, along with two same-day evening airings with one block from 6:00 to 11:00 p.m. ET and a repeat of the earlier block from 12:00 to 5:00 a.m. ET). With the reduction to two first-run soaps on the schedule, from July 2013 up until Soapnet&#x27;s cease in production, the timeslots in which same-day/day-behind repeats of the network soaps were reduced, with the two remaining first-run soaps airing on the channel – &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot; – airing in repeat blocks from 7:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. ET.

Prior to ABC&#x27;s cancellations of the former two series in 2011, daily reruns of &quot;All My Children&quot;, &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot; aired on the channel in that respective order as they had aired on ABC&#x27;s daytime schedule. &quot;All My Children&quot; had the most airings on the channel airing four times each weekday, one in the morning and three at night. Rebroadcasts of each soap&#x27;s episodes for the entire week aired each Saturday and Sunday during the late afternoon and nighttime hours; as of 2012, the network aired the past week&#x27;s episodes of &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; in Sunday primetime.

Due to it being owned by The Walt Disney Company, which also owns ABC, Soapnet cross-promoted &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; using the tagline &quot;weekdays on ABC and weeknights on SOAPnet&quot; when both shows aired on ABC. The same slogan continued to be used in promotions for &quot;General Hospital&quot; until the week of April 30, 2012 (inclusively). After a three-month hiatus, the &quot;weekdays on ABC and weeknights on SOAPnet&quot; slogan was revived in August 2012, but was used only for &quot;General Hospital&quot; promos airing on Soapnet and not those seen on ABC. References to &quot;Days of our Lives&#x27;s&quot; first-run airings on NBC (and until it was dropped from Soapnet in July 2013, &quot;The Young and the Restless&#x27;s&quot; first-run airings on CBS) were not included in the channel&#x27;s promos, instead only advertising their telecasts on Soapnet.

The channel also aired primetime drama series such as &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; and &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; each weekday during the late morning and afternoon hours, and as part of the &quot;Breakfast in Bed&quot; block between 6:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. ET each weekend. Weekend morning marathons of ABC&#x27;s cooking show &quot;The Chew&quot; (which had replaced &quot;All My Children&quot; on ABC) aired for a short time in December 2012 before being quickly dropped due to negative viewer reaction.

During the course of its lifetime, the channel occasionally aired past episodes in thematic format, such as &quot;Daytime&#x27;s Most Unforgettable Weddings&quot;, spotlighting the best episodes of popular couples on ABC&#x27;s soaps. Other thematic episode blocks included the &quot;Sonnylicious!&quot; marathon, featuring select episodes highlighting Maurice Benard&#x27;s best performances as his &quot;General Hospital&quot; character Sonny Corinthos, and the &quot;Tad the Cad&quot; marathon, with classic 1980s episodes of &quot;All My Children&quot; involving the Michael E. Knight character of Tad Martin&#x27;s romantic trysts with Liza Colby and her mother, Marian. These kinds of marathons were usually limited to series to which Soapnet had the rebroadcast rights (ABC&#x27;s soaps, &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; and previously, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;). However, in a lead-up to the 33rd Daytime Emmy Awards, the channel showed episodes of soaps that showcased performances that garnered award-nominating attention – including those from &quot;Guiding Light&quot; and &quot;As the World Turns&quot; – a first for the channel. Also, during its 13-year existence, the channel aired marathons of its acquired programs; such as on September 3, 2007, when it aired a marathon of &quot;The O.C.&quot; called &quot;Summer Spice&quot;, showcasting the metamorphosis of Summer Roberts (played by Rachel Bilson) throughout the series.

===Original dramatic programming===
The network only aired one dramatic series produced exclusively for the network, a prime-time spin-off of &quot;General Hospital&quot; entitled &quot;General Hospital: Night Shift&quot;, which aired for two seasons from July 2007 to October 2008.

===Movies===
In late 2008, the network entered into a distribution agreement with Sony Pictures Television to air a package of recent films from the studio&#x27;s library and some archived content on weekend evenings, along with several 20th Century Fox films and some in ABC and ABC Family&#x27;s telefilm archive aimed at the network&#x27;s target audience. The network discontinued airing films on April 30, 2011 as the network&#x27;s operations began to wind down, with much of its film library migrating to Lifetime Movie Network (which is owned in part by Disney through A&amp;E Networks).

<text>The Plunger&quot; classwas an early class of [[United States Navy]] [[submarine]]s. In the first years of their service, they were used primarily as training and experimental vessels for the newly formed &quot;silent service&quot; to familiarize naval personnel with the performance and operations of such craft. They were known as the &quot;A class&quot; after being renamed to A-type designations (&quot;A-1&quot; through &quot;A-7&quot;) on 17 November 1911. All except &quot;Plunger&quot; ended up being stationed in the [[Philippines]], an American possession, prior to the outbreak of [[World War I]]. They were shipped there on [[collier (ship)|colliers]] (coal-carrying ships) and formed an integral part of the harbor defense system for Manila. In some instances, this class of submarines is referred to as the Adder&quot; class, as USS &quot;Adder&quot; was the first boat of the class to be completed.

== Design and construction ==

These boats were essentially an enlarged and improved version of the &quot;Holland&quot;, with a much more powerful 4-cylinder, 160 bhp Otto engine and an enlarged battery. Their increased size allowed a crewman to stand upright inside the boat. They were designed by Electric Boat under the direct supervision of John Philip Holland and were known to the company as design EB 7. The design was considered such an advance over the &quot;Holland&quot; that the company took the unusual step of ordering a prototype of the class using internal company funds. The prototype, named &quot;Fulton&quot;, was built at Lewis Nixon&#x27;s Crescent Shipyard in New Jersey. It was a fortunate move, as the &quot;Fulton&#x27;s&quot; company trials turned up numerous deficiencies that needed to be corrected. These trials, along with the need to correct the noted deficiencies delayed the building of the &quot;Plungers&quot; quite a bit. On average the boats were delivered to the Navy two years late. Although &quot;Fulton&quot; eventually did quite well on trials, proving the capabilities of the &quot;Plungers&quot;, there were no approved appropriations from the Navy to purchase her so she was sold to Russia, and renamed .

A single hull design, all ballast and fuel tanks were located internally. The battery had 66 cells located underneath the torpedo reloads and was 24% more powerful than the one installed on &quot;Holland&quot;. The battery was open-topped, and when the decking was removed the battery acid could be seen sloshing around inside the cells. The top was shellacked wooden planks, with a layer of rubber above and finally a shellacked canvas covering. Holland&#x27;s emphasis was on optimizing underwater performance, and thus the boats had very little superstructure topside and a very small conning tower. Since these boats were intended for harbor defense and would be operating in relatively calm waters, this was not initially considered a problem. They were not internally subdivided, there was essentially one large compartment from bow to stern. One man, a very busy Commanding Officer, stood on a raised platform amidships with his head up inside the conning tower so he could see out of the small deadlight windows there. Initially there were no periscopes. Several wheels and control levers were within reach of this station, with the Commanding Officer acting as both a helmsman and a diving plane operator. He kept track of his bearings and any potential target by periodically broaching the boat so he could see out of the deadlights. The designed test depth was 100 feet, although &quot;Porpoise&quot; survived an accidental grounding at 144 feet in 1904.

Builder&#x27;s and Navy trials of the class noted several defects that needed to be corrected. Ventilation of the gasoline engine was poor, the main switchboard needed to be relocated, the 30-foot depth gauge was inadequate, the torpedo tube muzzle door was awkward to use, and periscopes were highly desired. Most notably, the lack of superstructure and the short conning tower made these boats prone to flooding when surfaced in even a moderate sea state. A modification program was drawn up and approved by the Navy and starting in January, 1905 the boats were taken in hand for the needed work. Eventually most of the boats were fitted with two fixed height periscopes, with a taller conning tower that had a large fairwater built around it. A removeable bow fairing was put in place to increase seaworthiness, helping to push the bow wake away from the conning tower. Since the boats found themselves spending more time on the surface than originally thought, a surface steering station was added forward of the conning tower fairwater, connected by a shaft to the main steering mechanism below. A small, metal framework and canvas bridge structure could be erected topside for extended surface transits. It had to be disassembled and taken below before diving. The diving process was quite lengthy and complicated, taking several minutes from being fully surfaced to fully submerged. The tactical environment that these boats operated in did not necessitate quick dives, thus the lengthy dive process was not seen as a liability.
At this point in their corporate history, Electric Boat was a design and engineering firm only. They did not have their own shipyard and thus sub-contracted out the construction of all their boats. The &quot;Plunger&quot; class was built at two different locations on both coasts of the United States. Five were built at the Crescent Shipyard in Elizabethport, New Jersey, while two more were built at Union Iron Works in San Francisco.

== Service ==
The five East Coast boats were based at Holland Torpedo Boat Station at New Suffolk, New York from 1903 until 1905, allowing New Suffolk to claim to be the first submarine base in the United States. As of January 1905, &quot;Grampus&quot; and &quot;Pike&quot; were at the Mare Island Navy Yard, &quot;Plunger&quot;, &quot;Porpoise&quot; and &quot;Shark&quot; were at the New York Navy Yard and &quot;Adder&quot; and &quot;Moccasin&quot; were assigned to Reserve Torpedo Flotilla in Norfolk, Virginia. 

In 1908 the &quot;A-2&quot;, &quot;A-4&quot;, &quot;A-6&quot; and &quot;A-7&quot; were moved on ships to Subic Bay in the Philippine Islands, where they served through the First World War. They were joined in 1915 by &quot;A-3&quot; and &quot;A-5&quot;. &quot;A-1&quot; (&quot;Plunger&quot;) served at Charleston, South Carolina until she was decommissioned in 1913.

After the initial deficiencies were worked out these boats served the Navy quite well for their entire service lives. They were considered pathfinders in submarine technology, and the design drew great interest from foreign navies. A slightly modified design, EB 7P, formed the basis for the first submarines of the British Royal Navy, and the navies of Japan, the Netherlands, and Imperial Russia. However, the rapidly advancing military technology of the early 20th century quickly made these boats obsolescent, and by the end of World War I they were completely outmoded. &quot;A-2&quot; (&quot;Adder&quot;), &quot;A-4&quot; (&quot;Moccasin&quot;), &quot;A-6&quot; (&quot;Porpoise&quot;) and &quot;A-7&quot; (&quot;Shark&quot;) were all decommissioned in December 1919.

The class was given alphanumeric hull classification symbols (SS-2, SS-3, etc.) on 17 July 1920, after all but &quot;Grampus&quot; (SS-4) and &quot;Pike&quot; (SS-6) had been decommissioned. &quot;Grampus&quot; and &quot;Pike&quot; were decommissioned in July 1921. All boats in the class, except &quot;Plunger&quot;, were used as targets. They were stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 16 January 1922 and sold for scrap.

<text>Nathan Joseph Harry Divinsky (October 29, 1925 – June 17, 2012) was a Canadian mathematician, university professor, chess master, writer, and politician. Divinsky was also known for being the former husband of the 19th prime minister of Canada, Kim Campbell. Divinsky and Campbell were married from 1972 to 1983.

==Early life, education, and academic career==
He was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1925, and was a contemporary and friend of Canadian Grandmaster and lawyer Daniel Yanofsky. Divinsky received a Bachelor of Science from the University of Manitoba in 1946. He received a Master of Science in 1947, and a PhD in Mathematics under A. A. Albert in 1950 from the University of Chicago after which he returned to Winnipeg and was on the staff of the Mathematics Department of the University of Manitoba for most of the &#x27;50s. Divinsky then moved to Vancouver where he served as a mathematics professor, and also as an assistant dean of science, at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, where he spent the remainder of his professional career.

He was featured in many segments relating to mathematics and chess on the Discovery Channel Canada program &quot;@discovery.ca&quot;, later called &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. During the first two seasons of the show, he presented a weekly contest segment emphasizing math puzzles.

==Political career==
Divinsky was a Vancouver School Board trustee from 1974 to 1980, and was the Chair from 1978 to 1980. He served as an alderman on Vancouver&#x27;s city council from 1981 to 1982.

==Chess life==
Divinsky learned his early chess as a teenager at the Winnipeg Jewish Chess Club, along with Yanofsky. He tied for 3rd–4th places in the Closed Canadian Chess Championship, held at Saskatoon 1945, with 9.5/12, along with John Belson; the joint winners were Yanofsky and Frank Yerhoff at 10.5/12. In the 1951 Closed Canadian Chess Championship, held at Vancouver, Divinsky scored 6/12 to tie for 5th–7th places. He won the Manitoba Championship in both 1946 and 1952, and finished runner-up in 1945. He tied for first place in the 1959 Manitoba Open. Divinsky scored 7.5/11 at Bognor Regis 1966, finishing in a tie for 7–13th places.

He represented Canada twice at the Chess Olympiads, in 1954 at Amsterdam (second reserve board, 0.5/1), and in 1966 at Havana (second reserve board, 4.5/8). Divinsky served as playing captain for both teams, and was the non-playing captain for the 1988 Canadian Olympiad team. Divinsky attained the playing level of National Master in Canada, and received through the Commonwealth Chess Association (founded by English Grandmaster Raymond Keene) the honorary title of International Master (although he did not receive this title officially from FIDE, the World Chess Federation).

Divinsky was also a Life Master at Bridge from 1972.

Divinsky served for 15 years, from 1959 to 1974, as editor of the magazine &quot;Canadian Chess Chat&quot;, and contributed occasionally to other Canadian chess magazines. He played an important role in chess organization in Canada from the 1950s. He first served as Canada&#x27;s representative to FIDE (the World Chess Federation), from 1987 to 1994, and served again in this post in 2007. During both terms, he served as a member of the FIDE General Assembly, since Canada is a zone of FIDE. He is a member of the Canadian Chess Hall of Fame, served as President of the Chess Federation of Canada in 1954, and was a Life Governor of the CFC.

He wrote several books on chess (see bibliography below). Chess historian Edward Winter in a 1992 review was very critical of Divinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Batsford Chess Encyclopedia&quot;, calling it &quot;A Catastrophic Encyclopedia&quot;. Winter in 2008 selected it as one of the five worst chess books in English from the past two decades. Winter&#x27;s 1989 review of Divinsky and Raymond Keene&#x27;s book &quot;Warriors of the Mind&quot; was also negative. In this book, the authors compared great chess champions throughout history using an advanced mathematical treatment; while necessarily imperfect due to generational evolution in chess, it was in fact the pioneering work in this field.

==Family, and marriage to Kim Campbell==
Divinsky was married three times. He had three daughters from his first marriage: Judy, Pamela, and Mimi. Divinsky met Kim Campbell, 22 years younger, while she was an undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia in the late 1960s. Their relationship continued while Campbell did graduate work at the London School of Economics, and the two were married in 1972. It was his second marriage and her first. Divinsky was a strong influence in interesting Campbell in political activity. The two divorced in 1983, but they remained on good terms. Their marriage produced no children. He died, aged 86, in Vancouver, survived by his third wife Marilyn Goldstone.

<text>The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (in case citations, E.D. Va.) is one of two United States district courts serving the Commonwealth of Virginia. It has jurisdiction over the Northern Virginia, Hampton Roads, and Richmond metro areas and surrounding locations with courthouses located in Alexandria, Norfolk, Richmond and Newport News (whose judges are shared with Norfolk).

Appeals from the Eastern District of Virginia are taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit.

== History ==
The United States District Court for the District of Virginia was one of the original 13 courts established by the Judiciary Act of 1789, , on September 24, 1789.

On February 13, 1801, the Judiciary Act of 1801, , divided Virginia into three judicial districts: the District of Virginia, which included the counties west of the Tidewater and south of the Rappahannock River; the District of Norfolk, which included the Tidewater counties south of the Rappahannock; and the District of Potomac, which included the counties north and east of the Rappahannock as well as Maryland counties along the Potomac. Just over a year later, on March 8, 1802, the Judiciary Act of 1801 was repealed and Virginia became a single district again, , effective July 1, 1802.

The District of Virginia was subdivided into Eastern and Western Districts on February 4, 1819, by . At that time, West Virginia was still part of Virginia, and was encompassed in Virginia&#x27;s Western District, while the Eastern District essentially covered what is now the entire state of Virginia. With the division of West Virginia from Virginia during the American Civil War, the Western District of Virginia became the District of West Virginia, and those parts of the Western District that were not part of West Virginia were combined with the Eastern District to again form a single District of Virginia on June 11, 1864, by . Congress again divided Virginia into the Eastern and Western Districts on February 3, 1871, by .

During the 1960s, Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. ran the Alexandria court, often ruled cases on the spot after motions were argued. The court earned the nickname of &quot;rocket docket&quot; for the speed and efficiency for which it processes its cases. Since 1997, the court has processed civil cases the fastest of the 94 federal districts, and eighth fastest in dealing with criminal cases. Courts at Richmond are located in the Spottswood W. Robinson III and Robert R. Merhige Jr. Federal Courthouse, having previously been held in the historic Lewis F. Powell Jr. United States Courthouse.

== Jurisdiction ==

The Eastern District of Virginia court&#x27;s jurisdiction covers slightly over six million people, comprising approximately 85% of the state&#x27;s population. Its jurisdiction is grouped into four geographic divisions:

=== Alexandria Division ===

The Alexandria Division covers the counties of suburban Washington, D.C.: Arlington, Fairfax, Fauquier, Loudoun, Prince William, and Stafford, and includes the independent cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, Manassas, Manassas Park, and Falls Church.

=== Richmond Division ===
The Richmond Division comprises the counties of Amelia, Brunswick, Caroline, Charles City, Chesterfield, Dinwiddie, Essex, Goochland, Greensville, Hanover, Henrico, James City, King and Queen, King George, King William, Lancaster, Lunenburg, Mecklenburg, Middlesex, New Kent, Northumberland, Nottoway, Powhatan, Prince Edward, Prince George, Richmond, Spotsylvania, Surry, Sussex, and Westmoreland, as well as independent cities such as Colonial Heights and Fredericksburg.

=== Norfolk Division ===
Norfolk Division includes the counties of Accomack, Northampton, Isle of Wight, Southampton, and independent cities such as Chesapeake, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Suffolk, and Virginia Beach.

=== Newport News Division ===
The Newport News Division includes the counties of Gloucester, Mathews, York County, James City and cities such as Hampton, Newport News, Poquoson, and Williamsburg.

== United States Attorney ==
The U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia is Erik S. Siebert, serving as prosecution for criminal cases brought by the federal government, and representing the United States in civil cases in the court. The U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office also manages the Project Safe Neighborhoods program within the district to reduce gun violence, and is involved with federal initiatives on drug trafficking, terrorism, cybercrime, and the prevention of elder care abuse.

<text>Copper Harbor is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located in Keweenaw County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is located within Grant Township. The population of the CDP was 136 as of the 2020 census.

The community is located at the northern tip of the Keweenaw Peninsula and is the northernmost permanently populated community in the state. Due to its natural environment and surroundings, which include Fort Wilkins Historic State Park, Copper Harbor is marketed as an all-season tourist destination.

==Etymology==
The name of the community, Copper Harbor, alludes to the former use of its harbor as a port for shipping copper mined from local deposits during the mid-19th century.

==History==

The Keweenaw Peninsula and the area that would become the Copper Country was home to the Ojibwe people prior to European settlement. In 1836, the Upper Peninsula was officially ceded from the Native American Chippewa to the United States following the signing of the Treaty of Washington. The treaty was signed in the national capital, Washington, D.C., by Henry Schoolcraft and Native American representatives from the Ojibwe and Odawa nations.

Copper Harbor was host to the first mineral land agency throughout the entire Lake Superior District. Captain Walter Cunningham was appointed by the United States Department of War to act as a Special Agent to the area. As soon as wayfinding was established in the spring of 1843, Cunningham had come to the area and opened his office, which was thereafter named the &quot;Government House&quot;. It was positioned on Porter&#x27;s Island, a small rocky island just opposite of present-day downtown Copper Harbor.

The Pittsburgh and Boston Copper Harbor Mining Company, formed by John Hayes of Cleveland, Ohio, began excavating some pits near Haye&#x27;s Point in Copper Harbor in 1844. It was a small development at first, but its mine was modern for its time, and the company struck it rich in 1845. The Pittsburgh and Boston mine operations were some of the first in the state of Michigan.

A few years later, the Central Mine, Cliff Mine, and others were opened and became successful. However, by 1870 the copper resources in the community had been largely worked out.

The community of Copper Harbor was listed as a newly organized census-designated place for the 2010 census, meaning it now has officially defined boundaries and population statistics.

==Geography==
In 2010, Copper Harbor was listed as a census-designated place. The CDP contains a total area of , of which is land and (37.86%) is water.

Copper Harbor is located at the northern edge of the Keweenaw Peninsula, which also extends for several miles to the east. Copper Harbor has its own post office and ZIP Code (49918). Some areas within the community and the surrounding area may use the Mohawk 49950 ZIP Code.

Beyond the community center, there are thick forests, limited roadways, and few developments.

Relative to other communities in the Keweenaw, Copper Harbor is from Mandan, north of Delaware, and east of Eagle Harbor. The village of Ahmeek is the nearest incorporated community at to the southwest.

=== Climate ===
Copper Harbor has a humid continental climate. Summers are warm but rarely hot due to the moderating influence of Lake Superior, while winters are cold and snowy, albeit milder than areas on similar parallels to the west, due to the low-scale maritime moderation. Although winter temperatures are similar to those in the nearest large metropolitan city Minneapolis, a couple of degrees latitude south-west, the main difference is that April is also a winter month in Copper Harbor, since the marine effects delay spring. The temperature lag effect is so great that March holds the town&#x27;s record low, and April&#x27;s record low temperatures are not much warmer than those of December.

=== Notable attractions ===

*Hunter&#x27;s Point is the name of a flat point, running out from the west into Lake Superior. It was named for an early settler of the area named Hunter who owned a tract of land on what is now Hunter&#x27;s Point. He is buried in the Fort Wilkins Cemetery. Today, Hunter&#x27;s Island is a Grant Township park, hosting a wide variety of both flora and fauna alike. It is also a well-known stop for migratory birds.
* Just outside the town is the northern terminus of U.S. Highway 41, which runs from Copper Harbor to Miami, Florida.
* Just east of downtown Copper Harbor is Fort Wilkins Historic State Park, an early restored frontier United States Army base originally built in 1844 to protect the vital port of Copper Harbor from the Ojibwe during the early years of the copper mining boom, America&#x27;s first great mining rush. It became clear later that issues in the region were their own—rough and icy winters, isolation, and sheer loneliness.

* The Copper Harbor Schoolhouse, one of the oldest one-room schools in Michigan, is found here. In 1999, this 140-year-old school had nine students who attended classes. The school district it lies in is called Grant Township Schools, District No. 2. The District motto is &quot;Searching For Knowledge&quot; and the mascot of the schoolhouse is the Copper Harbor Prospectors.
* Copper Harbor is home to a Fourth of July fireworks show that is locally notable on the Keweenaw Peninsula.
*Lake Fanny Hooe, named after the mining Captain William Albutrtis&#x27; juvenile sister-in-law, borders Fort Wilkins and is well known in the area for the origin of its name. This lake is one mile east of Copper Harbor, and runs parallel with the highway US-41. The lake is two miles long and a quarter mile wide, with a total depth of thirty-five feet and numerous points.
* The historic Copper Harbor Lighthouse is situated at the opening of the physical harbor itself. The lighthouse was rebuilt in 1866, replacing an original light from 1849, and is only accessible via a short ride in a compact, open vessel from the Copper Harbor Marina. Taken out of service in 1933, the historic navigational aid is one of the oldest lighthouses on Lake Superior. Within the yellow-bricked maritime post, furnishings from the era remain to conceptualize the life of the lighthouse keepers. Exhibits in the lighthouse museum cover both the lighthouse&#x27;s history and the local shipwreck culture of the area.
*The historic Copper Harbor Cemetery discloses the gravestones of some of the earliest settlers in the Copper Country, with the first recorded interment in 1853 and a number of other tombstones that predate the year 1900.
*Characterized as &quot;the most beautiful road in Michigan,&quot; Brockway Mountain Drive is a roadway that follows the spine of a ridge between the communities of Copper Harbor and Eagle Harbor, and it is the highest-paved road between the Rocky Mountains to the west and the Allegheny Mountains in the east. The notoriously picturesque road was constructed during the 1930s in the midst of the Great Depression by the Works Progress Administration. It offers views of Lake Superior, and the Keweenaw Peninsula, as well the archipelago of Isle Royale on an especially clear, transparent day. There is also a close on the drive called Brockway Mountain Lookout that offers a view of the community of Copper Harbor itself.
*In addition to the main 1849 Copper Harbor Lighthouse, the Copper Harbor Front Range and Rear Range Lights, both completed in 1869, remain and are locally considered to be iconic, as well as being the subject of memorabilia. The purpose of the Copper Harbor Range Lights was to do what the main lighthouse could not; it guided vessels and their sailors past the hazardous reefs on either side of the waterway.

==Demographics==
According to the 2020 census, the CDP had a population of 136. According to the 2021 American Community Survey, its median household income was $54,583.

==Gallery==
== Transportation ==
===Highways===
* travels through Copper Harbor and has its northernmost terminus just east of the community.
* has its northernmost terminus at U.S. Route 41 within the western portion of the community.

===Ferry services===
Copper Harbor contains a ferry port that provides transportation to Isle Royale National Park. The Isle Royale Line, Inc. (formerly named Isle Royale Ferry Service) operates the &quot;Isle Royale Queen IV&quot; out of Copper Harbor during the warmer months from May to September. The ferry takes 3.5 hours to travel across Lake Superior to Rock Harbor.

<text>Daily Planet was a television program on Discovery Channel Canada which featured daily news, discussion and commentary on the scientific aspects of current events and discoveries. The show first aired as @discovery.ca in 1995. It was relaunched as &quot;Daily Planet&quot; on September 30, 2002, adopting a &quot;science magazine&quot; programming format. The show adopted high definition in 2011. The show was cancelled by Bell Media on May 23, 2018 and its final episode aired on June 5, 2018.

From June 2012 until the show ended in May 2018, the hosts were Ziya Tong and Dan Riskin. &quot;Daily Planet&quot; aired on Discovery Channel Canada, Monday through Friday at 7 p.m.EST (Monday through Friday at 4 p.m.PST) as of September 4, 2012.

==History==
&quot;Daily Planet&quot; first aired on January 1, 1995, the same day as the premiere of Discovery Channel Canada, under the name &quot;@discovery.ca&quot;, it was an hour-long daily news magazine with a science news segment and several feature segments. During this era, the show aired for the fall/winter season. The summer season aired the variant show &quot;Summer@discovery.ca&quot;, with the daily science news segment, and repeats of feature segments from the fall/winter season in a half-hour format.

Jay Ingram, who hosted the show since Discovery Channel Canada&#x27;s inception, announced his retirement on May 16, 2011. &quot;Daily Planet: Jay&#x27;s Last Show&quot; aired on Sunday, June 5, 2011, which paid tribute to the host with flashbacks and guest segments.

Previous co-hosts include Gill Deacon (1996-2002), Natasha Stillwell, who left the show on February 2, 2007, temporary co-host Patty Kim, and Kim Jagtiani, who left in September 2008.

===Set design===
During the summer of 2002, the set was completely remade for the name change from &quot;@discovery.ca&quot; to &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. During the summer of 2006, the set of &quot;Daily Planet&quot; was completely made over. On the season premiere in September, the end of the show was about the rebuilding of the set. During the summer of 2011, the set was rebuilt to accommodate the relaunch of the show in high definition on August 29, 2011.

==Foreign versions==

An American version of the series, &quot;Science Daily&quot;, which was based in Washington, DC, aired on the Discovery-owned digital channel The Science Channel (then branded Discovery Science Channel) from 2000–2001, during the &quot;@discovery.ca&quot; era. Patty Kim hosted from Washington, DC. A weekly version called &quot;Discoveries This Week&quot;, hosted by Dan Duran, aired on that channel until 2006. The Science Channel more recently simulcasted a live &quot;Daily Planet&quot; special called &quot;Mars: The Phoenix Lands&quot; in HD on May 25, 2008.

International versions of &quot;Daily Planet&quot; are also produced for Discovery Channel (United States) Discovery Channel Latin America and Discovery Channel Asia.

<doc id="751808" wikidata="Q1366101" url="?curid=751808" title="Fingerpick">
<text>A fingerpick is a type of plectrum used most commonly for playing Lap steel guitar and bluegrass style banjo music. Hawaiian steel guitar players invented them to gain a more substantial sound from their instruments. The National Finger Pick was patented on July 20, 1928, by George Beauchamps and John Dopyera. Most fingerpicks are composed of metal or plastic (usually Celluloid or Delrin). Unlike flat guitar picks, held between the thumb and finger and used one at a time, fingerpicks clip onto or wrap around the end of the fingers and thumb; thus, one hand can pick several strings at once. Generally, three are used: one for the thumb, middle, and index fingers. Fingerpicks worn on the thumb are called &quot;thumbpicks&quot;. Some players use a plastic thumbpick while using metal fingerpicks. Fingerpicks come in various thicknesses to accommodate different musicians&#x27; styles of playing. Thin picks produce a quieter, more delicate sound, while thick picks produce a heavier sound. However, thumbpicks come in various styles and employ different materials, as with standard plectrums.

Fingerpicks are also used by guitar, Hawaiian guitar, lap steel, autoharp, pedal steel guitar and Dobro players. Fingerpicks generally take quite some time to adapt to, even for people who come from the more common (bare fingers with or without fingernails) fingerstyle techniques. Tone-wise, they are the most similar to standard guitar picks, offering a more consistent sound.

Some players combine a thumb pick and bare fingers/fingernails.

Classical guitar players, who traditionally use their fingernails to pluck the guitar&#x27;s strings, may use fingerpicks as an alternative to maintaining fingernails.

<text>Sidney Edward Paget (; 4 October 1860 – 28 January 1908) was a British artist of the Victorian era, best known for his illustrations that accompanied Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes stories in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;.

== Life ==
Sidney Paget was the fifth of nine children born to Robert Paget, the vestry clerk of St. James and St. John in Clerkenwell, and Martha Paget (née Clarke), a music professor. 
In 1881 Paget entered the Royal Academy Schools. Here he befriended Alfred Morris Butler, an architecture student who may have become the model for Paget&#x27;s illustrations of Dr. John Watson. Between 1879 and 1905 Paget contributed eighteen paintings, including nine portraits, to the Royal Academy exhibitions.

Paget&#x27;s drawings appeared in the &quot;Strand Magazine&quot;, the &quot;Pictorial World&quot;, &quot;The Sphere&quot;, &quot;The Graphic&quot;, &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;, and &quot;The Pall Mall Magazine&quot;, and his work became well known in both the United Kingdom and United States. He provided illustrations for Arthur Morrison&#x27;s Martin Hewitt detective stories and Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes work, doing much to popularise both series.

On 1 June 1893, Sidney Paget married Edith Hounsfield (1865—1942 or 1932?), daughter of William Hounsfield, a farmer. They had four daughters and two sons together: Leslie Robert (1894—1942); Winifred (1896); Edith Muriel (1897); Evelyn Mereoah (1899); Beryl May (1902—1955) and John L. Paget.

Sidney Paget died in Margate on 28 January 1908, at age 47, after suffering from a painful chest complaint for the last few years of his life. According to his death certificate, the cause of death was &quot;Mediastinal tumour, 3 years, exhaustion&quot;. Mediastinal tumours are growths that form in the central chest; as they grow, they increasingly constrict the lungs. The condition is rare, with unknown causes, and in the early twentieth century led to a painful and certain death.

Paget was buried in East Finchley Cemetery. Two brothers, H.M. (Henry Marriott) Paget (1856–1936) and Wal (Walter Stanley) Paget (1862–1935) were also successful portraitists and illustrators.

== &quot;The Strand&quot; illustrations ==


Paget is best remembered as the creator of the popular image of Sherlock Holmes from the original publication of Conan Doyle&#x27;s stories in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;. He was originally hired to illustrate &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series of twelve short stories that ran from July 1891 through June 1892.

In 1893, Paget illustrated &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, published in &quot;The Strand&quot; as further episodes of the &quot;Adventures&quot;. When Sir Arthur Conan Doyle revived the Sherlock Holmes series with &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;, serialised in &quot;The Strand&quot; in 1901–02, he specifically requested that Paget be the illustrator. Paget went on to illustrate another short story series, &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, in 1903–04. In all, he illustrated one Holmes novel and 37 Holmes short stories. His illustrations have influenced interpretations of the detective in fiction, film and drama.

&quot;The Strand&quot; became one of Great Britain&#x27;s most famous fiction magazines, with the Holmes series its most popular feature. As Holmes&#x27; popularity grew, Paget&#x27;s illustrations became larger and more elaborate. Beginning with &quot;The Adventure of the Final Problem&quot; in 1893, almost every Holmes story in &quot;The Strand&quot; featured a full-page illustration as well as many smaller ones.

Paget was the first to give Holmes his deerstalker cap and Inverness capedetails never mentioned in the stories and novels. The cap and cape first appear in an illustration for &quot;The Boscombe Valley Mystery&quot; in 1891 and reappear in &quot;The Adventure of Silver Blaze&quot; in 1893; they also appear in a few illustrations from &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. (The curved calabash pipe was added by the stage actor William Gillette.)

Altogether, Paget did some 356 published drawings for the Sherlock Holmes series. His depictions of Holmes became iconic and other illustrators found themselves compelled to imitate his style in their own depictions of Holmes.

A complete set of &quot;The Strand&quot; issues featuring the illustrated Sherlock Holmes tales is one of the rarest and most expensive collector&#x27;s items in publishing history. Paget&#x27;s original 6.75 x 10.5-inch drawing of &quot;Holmes and Moriarty in Mortal Combat at the Edge of the Reichenbach Falls&quot; was sold by Sotheby&#x27;s in New York on 16 November 2004 for $220,800.

Legend holds that the publishers of &quot;The Strand&quot; hired Paget accidentally when he mistakenly responded to a letter of commission intended for his younger brother Walter, but a 2019 paper published in the &quot;Baker Street Journal&quot; found no evidence for this story and much against it.
Another commonly held beliefthat Paget modeled his depiction of Holmes on that of Walterwas denied by their brother Henry Marriott Paget.

<text>Bellaire High School is a comprehensive, public secondary school in Bellaire, Texas. Part of the Houston Independent School District, it serves the incorporated city of Bellaire, the Houston community of Meyerland, and other adjacent Houston neighborhoods. It has a racially and socioeconomically diverse student body.

==History==

The school opened in 1955. It was originally an all-White high school. Because of the large number of Jewish students, the school had the nickname &quot;Hebrew High.&quot;

Bellaire introduced International Baccalaureate programs in 1980.

In the mid-to-late 1980s, families began moving into Bellaire and Meyerland. These families tore down many older houses and built new ones. This gave Bellaire High School a population of wealthier students. At the same time apartments formerly housing White singles began to house low income immigrants. Bellaire added Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate programs to encourage White parents to send their children to Bellaire. Parents strove to get their children into the classes. Mimi Swartz of the &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; said &quot;But these outstanding academic programs created, over time, a school within a school, in which the smartest kids with the most advantages took the IB and AP tracks, while everyone else was relegated to classes that, for various reasons--discipline problems, less talented teachers, lower standards--just weren&#x27;t as good.&quot;

In January 1987, Bellaire was offering the Arabic language for the second year. In 1987 the school also offered Chinese, French, German, Hebrew, Latin, Russian, and Spanish.

In September 1991, Bellaire was one of 32 HISD schools that had capped enrollments; in other words the school was filled to capacity and excess students had to attend other schools.

Bellaire High School was remodeled in the 1992-1993 period.

By the 2000s Bellaire placed on the lists of the top performing high schools in the United States. Athletic and academic programs won national and international awards. Many graduates attended prestigious American universities. At the same time, disciplinary infractions increased. From the 1999-2000 school year to the 2003-2004 school year, the total number of disciplinary actions increased from 441 to 1,082 and the number of in-school suspensions increased from 336 to 855. In February 2006, a stabbing involving two male freshmen occurred in a school stairwell. The victim survived the stabbing while the perpetrator was arrested and prosecuted.

During the same year Todd Spivak of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; reported about the school in the magazine&#x27;s feature &quot;These Kids Go to the Best Public High School in Houston.&quot; Spivak said that Bellaire High School had &quot;strong, consistent leadership and a diverse student population&quot; but that it received a lower rating due to a &quot;surprisingly high dropout rate.&quot; Spivak said that the survey indicated that Bellaire graduated two thirds of its students. Dr. Robert Sanborn, president and CEO of the Children at Risk organization, said that at Bellaire an achievement gap existed between the top-performing students and the lowest-performing students.

In 2007, 13 percent of high school-aged children zoned to Bellaire chose to attend a different Houston ISD school.

In 2010, Magnet Schools of America, a nonprofit, released a report recommending that Bellaire&#x27;s magnet program be abolished, due to overcrowding of the school.

In 2011, the Brays Oaks district expanded. A small portion of Bellaire High School attendance zone became a part of the district.

In 2014, HISD superintendent Terry Grier stated that Bellaire should reduce its enrollment to around 3,000 students.

After Chevron Corporation announced it was selling its office complex in Bellaire in 2016, HISD officials considered the idea of buying the property so a new Bellaire High School could be built there. Instead HISD decided to rebuild Bellaire High on its current site. In 2017 HISD announced plans to demolish the Gordon Elementary School/former Mandarin Immersion Magnet School campus in Bellaire so Bellaire High School&#x27;s baseball practice field could be relocated there, allowing HISD to easily rebuild the high school main campus.

On January 14, 2020, there was a fatal shooting where a senior died. The suspect received a manslaughter charge. The district attorney of Harris County stated that the evidence so far supports that the suspect had no intention of committing murder. HISD interim superintendent Grenita Latham stated that the district was exploring plans for metal detectors.

Around April 2021, the school announced there would be 9 students tied in the place for valedictorian for the spring graduating class of 2021.

Plans to demolish the main building began in summer of 2021. On May 15, 2021, visitors went through a final walk through event before demolition.
==Academic programs==
Mimi Swartz of &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; said in 2006 that Bellaire was &quot;arguably the city&#x27;s best public school&quot; and &quot;prestigious.&quot; Lynwood Abram of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said in 2006 that Bellaire is &quot;academically acclaimed&quot;. Jason Spencer of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said that the current principal and formal principal said that Bellaire has &quot;reputation for academic excellence&quot; because, in the words of former principal Hilbert Bludau, &quot;Parents felt ownership of that school.&quot; Cathy Mincberg, an HISD trustee, said in 1993 that &quot;There isn&#x27;t a private school in Houston that can beat Bellaire High School.&quot;

As of 2008, each year the school has about thirty National Merit Scholars. In 2005 it had 40 National Merit Scholars. Of 3,400 students, 323 were AP Scholars in 2005. Colleges and universities which have accepted Bellaire high school graduates include all 2016-2017 U.S. News &amp; World Report Top 10 Ranked National Universities, ranked: 
Princeton University, Harvard University, University of Chicago, Yale University, Columbia University, Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Duke University, University of Pennsylvania, and Johns Hopkins University as well as many more. As of 2008 Bellaire&#x27;s yearbook, the Carillion, frequently wins high school yearbook awards. The school typically has the highest SAT scores in the district. Bludau said that some parents tried to use political connections to ensure that their children entered Bellaire.

Out of over 20,000 high schools in the United States, the school ranked number 80th, 86th, 112th, 109th, and 100th in Newsweek&#x27;s 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2008 lists of the top high schools in the United States, respectively. The Challenge Index ranks schools by the number of AP and IB tests taken by students at a school in 2002 divided by the number of graduating seniors. 323 students at Bellaire High School in the 2004–2005 academic year earned the designation of AP Scholar by the College Board in recognition of their achievement on the college-level Advanced Placement Program Exams.

Bellaire also has a wide variety of music and fine arts programs. The Bellaire Theatre Department won 1st place at the state UIL One-Act Play Competition in 2004.

Bellaire led the Houston Independent School District in number of National Merit Program Finalists.

==Athletics==

Bellaire&#x27;s main athletic rival is Lamar High School.

The school&#x27;s baseball program won the Texas High School Baseball championship seven times with several former or current Major League Baseball players.

==Special programs==
Bellaire High School is denoted as a Magnet school for foreign languages, offering a wide array of languages taught from Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Arabic, Russian, Hindi, Japanese, Hebrew, Italian, and Latin. All languages are available at the IB level; and AP courses are taught in Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, and Latin.

In 2005, over 900 students tested for a space in the Magnet program; Bellaire had only 150 available spots. In the 2004–2005 school year, the TAKS passing percentages for all Magnet students in reading, math, science, and social studies were 100%, 99%, 96%, and 100% respectively.

Bellaire High School has Advanced Placement and IB Diploma Programme (International Baccalaureate) programs. Bellaire High School has been an IB World School since September 1979. In the last examination session, students completed the following exams (in both standard and higher levels): Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Economics, English A1, French B, Geography, German B, Hindi B, Italian B, Latin, Mandarin B, Mathematics, Music, Physics, Psychology, Russian B, Spanish Ab., Spanish B, Theory of Knowledge, and Visual Arts. In the 2005–2006 school year, there were 24 students who successfully received their IB Diplomas.

In the spring BHS hosts an open house for incoming students. Previously the open house emphasized the school&#x27;s difficulty. In 2013 it was changed to a &quot;jamboree&quot; format that emphasized the school&#x27;s social life.

==School culture==
According to an October 2004 Whatkidscando.org report called &quot;Students as Allies in Improving Their High Schools,&quot; in many of Houston ISD&#x27;s top high schools, including Bellaire, over one half of students are enrolled in high-level courses. According to the surveys given by the organization, many of the students at the schools cited academic pressure issues. 82 percent stated that they do not miss school during illnesses, stating that the makeup work would be too difficult.

Many parents volunteer at Bellaire. The parent-teacher organization has multiple committees. In 2005 the parents opened a &quot;college information center.&quot;

In 2006 Mimi Swartz said in &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; that the school was socially stratified. She said because drugs were &quot;plentiful&quot; in Meyerland, one community zoned to Bellaire, the drug culture among students &quot;would surprise no one. Drugs were everywhere, as socially segmented and niche marketed--bars (Xanax) for the rich kids, weed for the gang bangers, meth for the goths--as the designer sneakers and expensive handbags the students coveted.&quot;

==Location and campus==
Bellaire High School is located within the city of Bellaire, an enclave of the southwest area of Houston. Bellaire City Hall, the Bellaire Police Station, Bellaire Fire Station, and the Bellaire water tower are nearby. Several parks and playgrounds are in proximity. According to Ericka Mellon of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, the lot occupied by Bellaire High is one of the smallest used by an HISD school facility, and she stated that the district had a complication with rebuilding plans as it had the highest enrollment in the district. Bellaire area homeowners complained about potential complications from rebuilding plans.

In 2006 Mimi Swartz of &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; said that Bellaire &quot;still looks like the only high school in a small town. The architecture is blocky and unexceptional.&quot;

A new wing was recently added to the school, made possible through government grants. the wing is to include mostly science-based classes. with a special lab that cost nearly $300,000 designed specifically for the biology department.

==Demographics==
In 2006 Mimi Swartz of &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; said &quot;in the halls you see whites, blacks, Hispanics, and East and Central Asians.&quot; Bellaire also has disparate income gaps between students from wealthier families and students from poorer families.

Many students in other parts of Houston ISD transfer to Bellaire to escape home schools that do not have good academic performance, causing the attendance figures of those schools to suffer.

 most students at the school are within the Bellaire attendance zone.

In the 2022-2023 school year, the racial demographics of the student body consisted of:
* 42.4% Hispanic American
* 19.2% African American
* 21.4% White American
* 13.9% Asian American
* 0.2% Native American
* 2.7% Multiracial

==Neighborhoods served==

<text>Jay Ingram CM (born March 20, 1945) is a Canadian author, broadcaster and science communicator. He was host of the television show &quot;Daily Planet&quot; (originally titled &quot;@discovery.ca&quot;), which aired on Discovery Channel Canada, since the channel&#x27;s inception in 1995. Ingram&#x27;s last episode of &quot;Daily Planet&quot; aired on June 5, 2011. Ingram announced his retirement but stated he will make guest appearances on &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. He was succeeded by Dan Riskin. His book &quot;The End of Memory: A Natural History of Aging and Alzheimer&#x27;s&quot; was published by St. Martin&#x27;s Press in 2015.

==Biography==
Ingram hosted the science program &quot;Quirks and Quarks&quot; on CBC Radio One from 1979 (when he took over the show from David Suzuki) to 1992 (when he was succeeded by Bob McDonald). During his tenure Ingram won two ACTRA Awards and a Centre for Investigative Journalism Award. In 1993, Ingram hosted &quot;The Talk Show&quot;, a CBC Radio series about language, winning the &quot;Science in Society Journalism Award&quot; for his efforts. He then moved to CBC Television where he contributed science features to CBC Newsworld&#x27;s &quot;Canada Live&quot; and segments on the brain to &quot;The Health Show&quot; on the main network. In November 1994 he moved to the Discovery Channel.

Ingram is the author of several bestselling books including &quot;Talk, Talk, Talk: Decoding the Mysteries of Speech&quot;, &quot;The Science of Everyday Life&quot;, &quot;The Velocity of Honey: And More Science of Everyday Life, The Science of Why,&quot; and &quot;The Burning House: Unlocking the Mysteries of the Brain&quot;, which won the 1995 Canadian Science Writers Book Award. Ingram&#x27;s book &quot;Theatre of the Mind: Pulling Back the Curtain on Consciousness&quot; published by HarperCollins in October 2005 was chosen as one of The Globe and Mail&#x27;s Top 100 books for that year. Ingram had a weekly science column for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; for 12 years.

Ingram earned a bachelor of science degree in microbiology from the University of Alberta, followed by a master&#x27;s degree from the University of Toronto. He has also been awarded honorary degrees from six different Canadian universities: University of Alberta, Carleton, McGill, King&#x27;s College, McMaster and the University of Calgary.

== Geography ==
=== Americas ===
==== North America ====
Countries on the western side of North America have a Pacific coast as their western or south-western border. One of the notable exceptions is Panama, where the Pacific coast is primarily on its southern border. The first Europeans to see the Pacific Ocean were able to do so by crossing the narrow Isthmus of Panama. The unique position of Panama in relation to the Pacific Ocean resulted in the ocean initially being named the South Sea.

<text>Fly Pan Am, or Le Fly Pan Am, are a Canadian experimental rock band formed in Montreal in 1996. They release their albums through the Montreal-based Constellation Records, producing and collaborating on works with Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Shalabi Effect.

==About the band==
The band was formed in 1996 by guitarists Jonathan Parant and Roger Tellier-Craig, drummer Felix Morel, and bassist Jean-Sebastien Truchy. Eric Gingras would later on join the band in 2002, contributing guitar and percussion. They additionally shared personnel with Godspeed You! Black Emperor, until guitarist Roger Tellier-Craig left Godspeed You! Black Emperor in 2003 to concentrate full-time on Fly Pan Am.

The band is influenced by the French Canadian culture of Quebec, as well as the burgeoning avant-garde musical scene in Montreal. French is the predominant language used in producing albums and writing lyrics, with English peppered throughout. The track titles on past records, as stated by Roger Tellier-Craig, were written in a way to interpret the song, which Tellier-Craig concedes was &quot;lost on most listeners&quot; due to the French used. Unorthodox use of electronic sounds, occasionally provided by Alexandre St-Onge, serve to intersect and often confuse the listener.

The group often recorded their albums at the Hotel2Tango, a recording studio owned by Efrim Menuck and Thierry Amar of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, as well as Howard Bilerman. As a result of these ties, members of other Montreal-based bands sometimes participated as guest musicians or aided the recording process.

An announcement from the band in 2006 spoke of their indefinite hiatus and Parant&#x27;s part in Feu Thérèse. Tellier-Craig went on to found experimental pop band Pas Chic Chic with Gingras playing bass. Morel currently drums for the psychedelic sludge band, Panopticon Eyelids, and for Les Enfants Sauvages. Gingras has released two albums as Enfant Magique, the first self-released, the second, &quot;L&#x27;art d&#x27;enfiler les pearls&quot;, released by independent Montreal label, No Weapon.

In September 2018, the band announced on their Facebook page a re-formation after a 14-year hiatus to play a single live show in Montreal, along with new artwork to advertise as such. The band&#x27;s hiatus officially concluded with the announcement and release of their fourth studio album, &quot;C&#x27;est ça&quot;, in June and September 2019 respectively.

<text>The USS &quot;St. Louis&quot; (C-20/CA-18), was the lead ship of her class of protected cruisers in the United States Navy. &quot;St. Louis&quot; was launched on 6 May 1905 by the Neafie &amp; Levy Company, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was sponsored by Miss Gladys Bryant Smith and commissioned on 18 August 1906 with Captain Nathaniel R. Usher in command.

== Service history ==

=== Pre-war ===
Assigned to the Pacific Fleet, &quot;St. Louis&quot; departed Tompkinsville, New York, on 15 May 1907 following completion of her trials along the Virginia coast. &quot;St. Louis&quot; called at Port Castries, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, Montevideo, Punta Arenas, Valparaíso, Callao, and Acapulco before arriving at San Diego on 31 August 1907. Operating off the west coast into the spring of 1908, she steamed from Puget Sound to Honolulu in June, then cruised in Central American waters from July to October. On 5 November 1909, &quot;St. Louis&quot; returned to Puget Sound and was placed in reserve on 14 November.

Decommissioned on 3 May 1910, &quot;St. Louis&quot; was recommissioned, in reserve, on 7 October 1911 at the Puget Sound Navy Yard. She departed Puget Sound on 13 July 1911 for San Francisco and brief service as receiving ship there. After undergoing repairs, 22 July 1911 to 28 February 1912, she joined the Pacific Reserve Fleet again on 12 March. From 14 July 1912 until 26 April 1913, she operated in support of the Oregon Naval Militia, then returned to the Puget Sound Navy Yard to be placed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet for a year. She departed Puget Sound on 24 April 1914 and commenced her next assignment as receiving ship at San Francisco on the 27th. Returning north to Bremerton, &quot;St. Louis&quot; was again placed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet on 17 February 1916.

Detached from the Reserve Fleet on 10 July 1916, &quot;St. Louis&quot; departed Puget Sound on 21 July for Honolulu. Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 29 July, she commenced her next duty assignment as tender, Submarine Division Three, Pacific Fleet, with additional duty as station ship, Pearl Harbor. When it became evident that the crew of the interned German sloop intended to scuttle their ship, an armed party from &quot;St. Louis&quot; boarded the ship on 4 February 1917 and seized her. &quot;Geier&quot; subsequently served the United States as .

=== World War I ===
Placed in reduced commission on 6 April 1917, as the United States entered World War I, &quot;St. Louis&quot; departed Honolulu on 9 April to join the cruiser force engaged in escorting convoys bound for Europe. Calling first at San Diego, she took on board 517 National Naval Volunteers and apprentice seamen to bring her war complement to 823 officers and men. On 20 April, she was placed in full commission. A month later, she arrived in the Panama Canal Zone and embarked the 7th, 17th, 20th, 43d, 51st and 55th companies of Marines. She transported them to Santiago de Cuba and then sailed for Philadelphia, arriving on 29 May 1917.

&quot;St. Louis&#x27;s&quot; first convoy duty began on 17 June 1917 when she departed New York in escort of Group 4, American Expeditionary Force. Returning to Boston for repairs on 19 July 1917, she had completed six additional voyages, escorting convoys bound from New York for ports in Britain and France by the end of the war.

Together with the USS &quot;Huntington&quot; she left Halifax on 30 October 1917 carrying members of a high-level U.S. Commission to confer with the European Allies. Escorted by USS Balch and other British and American vessels she arrived in Plymouth on the evening of 7 November.

=== Post-war ===
After the Armistice, &quot;St. Louis&quot; was immediately pressed into service returning troops to the United States. She returned 8,437 troops to Hoboken, New Jersey, from Brest, France, in seven round-trip crossings between 17 December 1918 and 17 July 1919 when she arrived at the Philadelphia Navy Yard for repairs.

Designated CA-18 on 17 July 1920 and assigned to post-war duty with the European Squadron, &quot;St. Louis&quot; departed Philadelphia on 10 September 1920 for Sheerness, Cherbourg and Constantinople. She disembarked military passengers at Sheerness on 26 September, then continued on to the Mediterranean and reported to the Commander, United States Naval Forces in Turkish Waters at Constantinople on 19 October. Standing up the Bosphorus from Constantinople on 13 November, &quot;St. Louis&quot; embarked refugees at Sevastopol and Yalta, returning them to Constantinople on 16 November. The following day, her crew formed boat landing parties to distribute food among refugees quartered aboard naval transports anchored in the Bosphorus. &quot;St. Louis&quot; continued her humanitarian duties at Constantinople and at Anatolian ports during the time of unrest caused by the Russian Civil War and the Turkish revolution.

She departed Asia Minor for Naples on 19 September 1921 and called at Gibraltar.

== Decommissioning and fate ==
On 11 November, &quot;St. Louis&quot; arrived at Philadelphia where, on completion of pre-inactivation overhaul, she was decommissioned on 3 March 1922. In reserve until struck from the Navy List on 20 March 1930, &quot;St. Louis&quot;&#x27;s hulk was sold for scrap on 13 August in accordance with the provisions of the London Naval Treaty and Second London Naval Treaty for the limitation and reduction of naval armament.

<doc id="751852" wikidata="Q7763250" url="?curid=751852" title="The Seldom Scene">
<text>The Seldom Scene is an American bluegrass band that formed in 1971 in Bethesda, Maryland. The band&#x27;s original line-up comprised John Starling on lead vocals and guitar, Mike Auldridge on Dobro and baritone vocals, Ben Eldridge on banjo, Tom Gray on double bass, and John Duffey on mandolin; the latter three also provided backing vocals. Together they released their debut studio album, &quot;Act I&quot;, in 1972, followed by both &quot;Act II&quot; and &quot;Act III&quot; in 1973.

In 1977, Starling left the group and was replaced by singer-songwriter Phil Rosenthal. Starling and Rosenthal shared lead vocals on the group&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Baptizing&quot;, released in 1978. Around the same time, the group switched record labels from Rebel Records to Sugar Hill Records. In 1986, Rosenthal and Gray left the band, and were replaced by Lou Reid and T. Michael Coleman, respectively; Reid and Coleman first appeared on the band&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;A Change of Scenery&quot;. Reid left the band in 1992, and Starling briefly returned to the group, performing on their 1994 album &quot;Like We Used to Be&quot;. Starling was replaced by Moondi Klein as the band&#x27;s lead singer.

During 1995 and 1996, Klein, Coleman, and Auldridge, left the Seldom Scene to form a new band called Chesapeake. Duffey and Eldridge recruited guitarist Fred Travers, bassist Ronnie Simpkins, and guitarist and singer Dudley Connell into the Seldom Scene, and together released the album &quot;Dream Scene&quot; in 1996. That same year, Duffey died of a heart attack. Reid returned to the band to replace Duffey on mandolin, and the group released the album &quot;Scene It All&quot; in 2000. The group&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Scenechronized&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album. The band&#x27;s original members (Auldridge, Duffey, Eldridge, Gray, and Starling) were inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame in 2014.

==History==
===Formation and early career (1971)===
The Seldom Scene was established in 1971, and they would practice in Ben Eldridge&#x27;s basement. These practice sessions included John Starling on guitar and lead vocals, Mike Auldridge on Dobro and baritone vocals, and former Country Gentlemen member Tom Gray on bass. The mandolinist John Duffey, who had also performed with the Country Gentlemen, was invited to jam sessions at the time when Mike Auldridge arranged for the group to play as a performing band.
Another member of the Country Gentlemen, Charlie Waller, is responsible for the band&#x27;s name. Expressing his doubt that this new band could succeed, Waller reportedly asked Duffey, &quot;What are you going to call yourselves, the seldom seen?&quot; The band had weekly performances at clubs and performed regularly at the Red Fox Inn, a music club in Bethesda Maryland. The band switched over to the Birchmere music hall in Alexandria, Virginia, which resulted in a residency.

===Members&#x27; backgrounds===
Each of the band members had a job during the week; Duffey repaired musical instruments, Eldridge was a mathematician, Starling a physician, Auldridge a graphic artist, and Gray a cartographer with National Geographic. They agreed to play one night a week at local clubs, perform occasionally at concerts and festivals on weekends, and make records. After playing for six weeks at a small Washington, D.C., club called the Rabbit&#x27;s Foot, the group found a home at the Red Fox Inn in Bethesda, Maryland. They performed at that venue Friday nights from January 1972 through September 1977 before starting weekly performances at the Birchmere music hall.

===Rise to popularity (1972–1976)===
The progressive bluegrass style played by the Seldom Scene had become increasingly popular during the 1970s, especially Duffey&#x27;s high tenor and the vocal blend of Duffey/Starling/Auldridge. Their weekly shows included bluegrass versions of country music, rock, and even classical pop. The band&#x27;s popularity soon forced them to play more than once a week —but they continued to maintain their image as being seldom seen, and on several of their early album covers were photographed with the stage lights on only their feet, or with their backs to the camera. Though the Scene remained a non-touring band, they were prolific recorders, producing seven albums in their first five years of existence, including one live album (among the first live bluegrass albums).

===John Starling&#x27;s departure and Phil Rosenthal as lead singer (1977–1986)===
In 1977, John Starling left the group to focus on his medical career, and was replaced by singer and songwriter Phil Rosenthal, whose song &quot;Muddy Water&quot; had been recorded by the Scene on two earlier albums. Starling and Rosenthal shared their lead vocals on the group&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Baptizing&quot; (recorded in 1978). Around the same time, the group switched record labels from Rebel to Sugar Hill. Starling recorded a solo album for Sugar Hill in 1980 called &quot;Long Time Gone&quot; and another in 1982 called &quot;Waitin&#x27; On a Southern Train&quot;, on both of which Mike Auldridge played.

The lineup of Rosenthal-Duffey-Gray-Auldridge-Eldridge recorded five albums of a comparable popularity to the ones with the founding members, including John Starling. Rosenthal proved to be as good lead singer as Starling and his baritone voice contrasted well with Duffey&#x27;s high tenor extravaganzas. He also wrote typically two to three songs on each of the albums and also added acoustic guitar solos to the group.

===More changes in lineup (1986–1996)===
In 1986, Phil Rosenthal and Tom Gray both left the band to focus on other pursuits, and were replaced by Lou Reid and T. Michael Coleman, respectively. Coleman proved to be very controversial, as many purists objected to his use of an electric bass in what is nominally an acoustic genre, but the albums produced by the band after Coleman&#x27;s arrival maintained the traditional appeal of any of the Scene&#x27;s earlier albums.

Reid left the band in 1992, and Duffey convinced former member John Starling to return to the band for the next year. During that year the Scene recorded the album &quot;Like We Used to Be&quot;, but Starling did not wish to stay with the band long term. He was replaced in 1994 by lead singer Moondi Klein.

Throughout these changes, band leader John Duffey&#x27;s original plan of keeping a light touring schedule and staying close to home continued to prevail. During 1995 and 1996, Klein and Coleman, along with original member Mike Auldridge, wanting to be part of a full-time project, left the Seldom Scene to form a new band called Chesapeake. For a time the Scene stopped recording.

Duffey and Eldridge, the two remaining original members, recruited resophonic guitar player Fred Travers, bassist Ronnie Simpkins, and guitarist and singer Dudley Connell to join the band, and the reconstituted group recorded an album in 1996 and continued live appearances.

===John Duffey&#x27;s death, return of Lou Reid, and &quot;Scene It All&quot; (2000–2006)===
In late 1996, band leader and founder John Duffey suffered a fatal heart attack.

Banjoist Ben Eldridge, the sole remaining original member of the Seldom Scene, assumed leadership of the band. Former guitarist Lou Reid rejoined the band, replacing Duffey on mandolin. Initially the new Scene concentrated on live performances, but in 2000 the group recorded a new album, &quot;Scene It All&quot;. The Seldom Scene continues to tour, and has recorded for the Sugar Hill Records and Smithsonian Folkways labels.

===&quot;Scenechronized&quot;, &quot;Long Time... Seldom Scene&quot;, and &quot;Changes&quot; (2007–present)===

Seldom Scene continues to perform and has received critical acclaim for their work. &quot;Scenechronized&quot;, recorded in 2007, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album.

In July 2008, Seldom Scene performed at a White House dinner honoring the 2008 U.S. Olympic team as well as previous U.S. Olympians. Seldom Scene also played the National Folk Festival July 11–13, 2008, representing bluegrass music.

On April 22, 2014, the band returned with &quot;Long Time... Seldom Scene&quot;, via Smithsonian Folkways. The collection features interpretations of 16 oft-requested tunes and is the band&#x27;s first studio album since the &quot;Scenechronized&quot; in 2007. In 2015, &quot;Long Time...Seldom Scene&quot; and &quot;Mean Mother Blues&quot; won awards in the &quot;Bluegrass&quot; Album and Song categories at The 14th Annual Independent Music Awards.

In January 2016, Ben Eldridge retired after 44 continuous years with the band. He was replaced by Rickie Simpkins.

In 2017, Ron Stewart joined the Seldom Scene, replacing Rickie Simpkins.

In 2019, the Seldom Scene released the album &quot;Changes&quot;, featuring songs by songwriters of the 1960s and early 1970s, through Rounder Records.

The band currently consists of Dudley Connell (guitar/lead vocals), Ron Stewart (banjo/fiddle/guitar), Lou Reid (mandolin/tenor vocals), Fred Travers (dobro/lead vocals), and Ronnie Simpkins (bass/baritone vocals). Ben Eldridge&#x27;s son, Chris, also frequently performs with the group.

<text>Ogden Livingston Mills (August 23, 1884 – October 11, 1937) was an American lawyer, businessman and politician. He served as United States Secretary of the Treasury in President Herbert Hoover&#x27;s cabinet, during which time Mills pushed for tax increases, spending cuts and other austerity measures that would deepen the economic crisis. A member of the Republican Party, Mills also represented New York in the United States House of Representatives, served as 
Undersecretary of the Treasury during the administration of President Calvin Coolidge, and was the Republican nominee in the 1926 New York gubernatorial election.

==Early life==
Mills was born on August 23, 1884, in Newport, Rhode Island, the son of Ogden Mills (1856–1929), a financier and racehorse owner, and his wife, the former Ruth T. Livingston (1855–1920), granddaughter of Maturin Livingston (1769–1847). He had twin sisters, Beatrice Mills Forbes (1883–1972) and Gladys Mills Phipps (1883–1970), and was the grandson of the banker Darius Ogden Mills.

Mills graduated from Harvard University in 1904, and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1907. He was admitted to the bar in 1908.

==Career==
Mills and his sister Gladys owned Wheatley Stable, a horse racing and breeding operation. Their stable owned and bred Seabiscuit as well as Bold Ruler, whose offspring includes Secretariat.

Mills also owned Kantar who won the 1928 Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe.

After his father&#x27;s death in 1929, Mills and each of his sisters received $12,197,034 from their father&#x27;s estate.

===Political career===
Mills was a delegate to the 1912, 1916 and 1920 Republican National Conventions. He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1915 to 1917, sitting in the 138th, 139th and 140th New York State Legislatures, and was the Chairman of the Committee on Affairs of the New York City, New York in 1917.

He resigned his seat on July 31, 1917 to enlist in the United States Army, and served with the rank of captain until the close of World War I.

After the war, he served as president of the New York State Tax Association. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives from New York&#x27;s 17th Congressional District as a Republican, serving in the 67th, 68th and 69th United States Congresses, holding office from March 4, 1921 until March 3, 1927.

In 1926, Mills ran on the Republican ticket for the Governor of New York, but was defeated by Al Smith, the incumbent Democrat.

===Treasury===

Mills was appointed in 1927, by President Calvin Coolidge as the Undersecretary of the Treasury, serving under Secretary Andrew W. Mellon.

In 1932, Mills was appointed by President Herbert Hoover as Secretary of the Treasury. While Secretary, Mills acted as an adviser to President Hoover and actively campaigned for Hoover&#x27;s reelection in 1932, traveling to Detroit, St. Louis, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, and Minneapolis on his behalf. Hoover&#x27;s opponent was then-Governor of New York Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat who was Mills&#x27;s college friend and life-long neighbor. Mills remained in office until March 3, 1933.

===Later life===
After leaving the Treasury Department, Mills was highly critical of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal policies. He continued to be active in business, and published his views in two books, &quot;What of Tomorrow&quot; in 1935 and &quot;The Seventeen Million&quot; in 1937.

Mills served on the boards of the Lackawanna Steel Company, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, Virginia &amp; Truckee Railroad, Mergenthaler Linotype Company and the Shredded Wheat Company.

While in New York, Mills was an active member of the New York Civitan Club.

==Personal life==
On September 20, 1911, Mills married his first wife, Margaret Stuyvesant Rutherfurd (1891–1976), the daughter of Anne Harriman Rutherfurd and Lewis Morris Rutherfurd Jr. At the time of their wedding, she was the step-daughter of William Kissam Vanderbilt and the granddaughter of Lewis Morris Rutherfurd (1816–1892) and Oliver Harriman (1829–1904). They divorced in 1919. In 1922, she married Sir Paul Henry Dukes (1889–1967). They divorced in 1929 and, later that same year, she married Prince Charles Michel Joachim Napoléon (1892–1973), son of Joachim, 5th Prince Murat. They also divorced and in 1939, she married Frederick Leybourne Sprague.

On September 2, 1924, Mills married his second wife, Dorothy (née Randolph) Fell (d. 1968), the former wife of banker John R. Fell.

Mills died of heart disease in Manhattan, New York, on October 11, 1937. He had no children, but was the stepfather of three by his second wife. He was interred in St. James Churchyard, Hyde Park, New York.

<text>M-100 is a north–south state trunkline highway in the central region of the U.S. state of Michigan. It runs between Potterville and Grand Ledge, connecting Interstate 69 (I-69) and I-96 west of the state capital, Lansing. The highway was previously a section of M-16. After M-16 was realigned, M-100 was created by 1927. Three extensions in the 1930s, 1950s and 1990s resulted in the current highway routing.

==Route description==
M-100 starts at exit 66 on I-69 in Potterville. The highway runs north along Hartel Road, intersecting Lansing Road, the former route of US Highway 27 (US 27) south of downtown. Hartel Road runs due north from Potterville to Grand Ledge. North of M-43 (Saginaw Highway), M-100 follows Clinton Street, jogging northwest along Jefferson Street north of Willow Highway. Crossing the Grand River on Bridge Street, M-100 returns to Clinton Street north of the river. North of town, the roadway is once again known as Hartel Road before changing to Wright Road near the Abrams Municipal Airport. North of Grand River Highway, which is the former route of US 16, M-100 meets I-96 and ends; Wright Road continues to the north of the interchange.

Like other state highways in Michigan, M-100 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department&#x27;s traffic surveys showed that on average, 16,626 vehicles travelled along the highway in the city of Grand Ledge and 5,419 vehicles used the highway daily between Potterville and Grand Ledge, the highest and lowest counts respectively. No section of M-100 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

==History==
M-100 was created in 1925 when M-16 was rerouted directly between Lansing and Eagle. M-100 started at M-39 in Grand Ledge and ran north to M-16 in Eagle. The highway was extended southward in 1932 to end at US 27/M-78 in Potterville. The northern end was extended to meet the US 16 (now I-96) freeway in 1958. The south was similarly extended in 1991 with the completion of the I-69/US 27 freeway south of Potterville.

<text>Ogden Mills (December 18, 1856 – January 29, 1929) was an American financier and Thoroughbred racehorse owner.

==Early life==
Ogden Mills was born on December 18, 1856, in Sacramento, California, to Jane Templeton Cunningham and Darius Ogden Mills (1825–1910). His father was a highly successful banker and investor who, upon his death in 1910, left Ogden Mills and his sister, Elisabeth Mills, who married Whitelaw Reid an estate valued at $36,227,391. As a result of his father&#x27;s many corporate investments, Ogden Mills served on the Board of Directors of a number of companies including the New York Central Railroad.

==Thoroughbred racing==
A member of The Jockey Club, Ogden Mills raced horses in the United States and maintained a racing stable in France in partnership with Lord Derby. Among their successes in that country, they won the 1928 Grand Prix de Paris with the colt Cri de Guerre, bred by Evremond de Saint-Alary. On his death in 1929, Ogden Mills left to his daughter Beatrice, a resident of London, England, married to Bernard Forbes, 8th Earl of Granard, his French racing stable and a home at 73 Rue de Varenne in Paris. That year, Beatrice led all French owners in purses earned.

In 1926, Mills&#x27; daughter Gladys and son Ogden established Wheatley Stable, which became one of the preeminent racing and breeding operations in American racing history.

==Personal life==
In 1882, Ogden Mills married Ruth T. Livingston (1855–1920), daughter of Maturin Livingston Jr. and Ruth Baylies a descendant of Thomas Baylies (1687–1756). She was the twin sister of Elizabeth Livingston (1855–1943), who was married to William George Cavendish-Bentinck (1854–1909). She was also the granddaughter of Maturin Livingston (1769–1847) and Margaret Lewis (1780–1860), who was the only daughter and sole heiress of Gov. Morgan Lewis (1754–1844). Together, Ogden and Ruth had three children, twin daughters and a son:

* Gladys Livingston Mills (1883–1970), who married Henry Carnegie Phipps (1879–1953) in 1907
* Jane Beatrice Mills (1883–1972), who married Bernard Forbes, 8th Earl of Granard (1874–1948) in 1909
* Ogden Livingston Mills (1884–1937), who became the 50th United States Secretary of the Treasury in 1932, and married Margaret Stuyvesant Rutherfurd in 1911. After their divorce in 1919, he married Dorothy Randolph Fell, former wife of the banker John R. Fell, in 1924.

Mills&#x27; wife inherited the Livingston mansion in Staatsburg, New York, which the couple used as a summer home and where they raised horses.

Ruth Livingston Mills died at their residence in Paris, France, on October 13, 1920. Ogden Mills died of pneumonia on January 29, 1929, at the family home in New York City. Ogden Mills was buried with his wife at the mausoleum in St. James&#x27;s Cemetery in Hyde Park, New York.

===Philanthropy===
Like his father, Ogden Mills was involved in a number of charitable causes and the Ogden Mills &amp; Ruth Livingston Mills State Park encompasses their mansion at Staatsburg, New York, that is now Staatsburgh State Historic Site.

Mills was instrumental in assisting the State of New York to erect a statue of Robert Livingston, his wife&#x27;s great-great-great-grandfather, into the National Statuary Hall Collection in Washington, D.C., highlighting him as one of the state&#x27;s two most illustrious citizens.

===Descendants===
Through his eldest daughter, he was the grandfather of Barbara Phipps Janney and Ogden Phipps (1908–2002), and the great-grandfather of Ogden Mills Phipps (1940–2016) and Cynthia Phipps, also major figures in horse racing.

<doc id="751871" wikidata="Q2743454" url="?curid=751871" title="Operation Red Dog">
<text>Operation Red Dog was the code name of an April 27, 1981, military filibustering plot by Canadian and American citizens, largely affiliated with white supremacist and Ku Klux Klan groups, to overthrow the government of Dominica. They planned to restore former Prime Minister Patrick John to power. The chief figures included American Klansman Mike Perdue, German-Canadian neo-Nazi Wolfgang Droege, American white supremacist Don Black and Barbadian weapons smuggler Sydney Burnett-Alleyne. After the plot was thwarted by US federal agents in New Orleans, Louisiana, the news media dubbed it &quot;Bayou of Pigs&quot;, after the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba.

The leader Mike Perdue and six other men pleaded guilty to violation of the Neutrality Act; two others were found guilty by a jury. The men each received three-year prison sentences. Another man linked to the plot committed suicide after being implicated as a financier. 

Perdue claimed former Texas Governor John Connally and Congressman Ron Paul (R-TX) knew about the plot, but United States district judge Lansing Mitchell stated that neither had any connection to the plot and refused to subpoena them.

==Mission==

On April 27, 1981, Droege and eight other men, including Canadian James Alexander McQuirter and American Don Black, who later founded the white nationalist website Stormfront, were arrested by federal agents in New Orleans as they prepared to board a boat supplied with automatic weapons, shotguns, rifles, handguns, dynamite, ammunition, and a black and white Nazi flag.

The plan was to charter a boat to Dominica and rendezvous via rubber boats with Patrick John and his makeshift army. The genesis of the idea came from long-time Klan member Perdue, who was introduced in 1979 to Droege. That summer, Perdue outlined his plan to overthrow the government of Grenada and set up several lucrative businesses. After their meeting, they determined that Droege would locate funds and resources. Croatian-Canadian Don Andrews was initially involved, but after Perdue changed the target island to Dominica, Andrews withdrew. Klansmen Arnie Polli and Roger Dermee were paid US$3,000 to visit Dominica and make a preliminary reconnaissance. German-Canadian neo-Nazi Martin K. Weiche was allegedly a financial backer of the plot, along with James White of Houston and L. E. Matthews of Jackson, Mississippi.

In February 1981, the captain and crew backed out. Perdue approached Michael S. Howell, a local boat captain and Vietnam War veteran. Perdue said that the Central Intelligence Agency needed his boat for a covert operation. Howell then contacted the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF). On April 25, John was arrested in Dominica. When Perdue learned of the arrest and that their plans were no longer secret, he insisted that the mission should continue. On April 27, the group, including three undercover ATF agents, met at the predetermined location, loaded the van and proceeded to a marina where local police were waiting for them.

On June 21, 1981, lawyer J.W. Kirkpatrick of Memphis, linked to the coup attempt by court testimony, killed himself with a shotgun. Perdue testified that he&#x27;d received $10,000 from Kirkpatrick to finance the assault on Dominica. Kirkpatrick was the brother-in-law of former congressional representative E.C. &#x27;Took&#x27; Gathings (D-AR). Friends said that Kirkpatrick had extremely conservative political views, as did the former congressman, and thought the coup would prevent a communist takeover. One colleague said Kirkpatrick was a &quot;super-ultra-ultra-ultra-conservative,&quot; who &quot;thought the country was going to hell in a hand-basket.&quot; Perdue also testified that he used $70,000 collected from businessmen to purchase weapons, dynamite and other military equipment, and to pay for reconnaissance trips to Dominica.

In 1984, during an interview by Barbados&#x27;s daily &quot;Nation Newspaper&quot;, Sydney Burnett-Alleyne, one of the leaders of the plot, was asked if the group had planned to overthrow the government of Barbados and install John as prime minister there as well. He responded:

A book about the plot, &quot;Bayou of Pigs&quot;, by Canadian journalist Stewart Bell, was published in August 2008.

<text>Mejillones is a Chilean port city and commune in Antofagasta Province in the Antofagasta Region. Its name is the plural form of the Spanish meaning &quot;mussel&quot;, referring to a particularly abundant species and preferred staple food of its indigenous inhabitants. It is situated in the northern side of the Mejillones Peninsula, 60 km north of the city of Antofagasta. To the west, in the northern part of peninsula, is , the site of the naval combat of the same name, fought during the War of the Pacific (1879-1883).

Mejillones is surrounded by the waters of the Pacific Ocean to the west and by the most arid desert in the world to the east, the Atacama Desert. It also marks the country&#x27;s widest point (362 km) along a parallel.

==History==
The settlement of Mejillones dates back to the first communities of Chango people who inhabited the coastal area from 1825.

Mejillones was included in maps of the Captaincy General of Chile in the 18th century, depending from the city of Copiapó.

Between 1838 and 1839, French businessmen known as (&quot;Brothers Latrille&quot;), contracted mining services of the Copiapino Juan López (miner known as Chango Lopez, considered the founder of Antofagasta), to mine guano deposits located south of Mejillones. In this manner, Luan López began mining around the vicinity of San Luciano hill in 1841. The concession for the mining of this raw material was obtained by Domingo Latrille at the hands of the Bolivian government, which would last until 1842. Between 1841 and 1842, they made the largest shipments of this product to Europe.

In 1845, President of Bolivia Manuel Isidoro Belzu had a small fort built on the south side of Mejillones, to become a minor port of Bolivia. Through project development, the Bolivian government proposed to establish a major port city in the large jurisdiction of Mejillones.

The territory was disputed between Chile and Bolivia until the signing of the Boundary Treaty of 1866. Bolivia and Chile mutually agreed to finance the construction of the (&quot;Offices of Administration and Security of Customs&quot;) in order to protect the interests of Chilean workers and to implement an export tax on minerals, primarily salt and guano. Subsequently, one of these buildings was transferred to the city of Antofagasta during the War of the Pacific; currently, this building is still in force and designated as the &quot;Regional Museum&quot;.

On October 8, 1879, the Battle of Angamos was fought here in front of the peninsula of Angamos between the navies of Chile and Peru, which ended in the Chilean capture of the monitor . Afterward, the increasingly prosperous nitrate industry showed a boom going through the port at Mejillones, where the mineral boarded on the Antofagasta railroad left for foreign ports abroad. During this time, strong waves wreaked havoc on the shipping facilities, which required the reestablishment of Mejillones, this time reborn under the Chilean flag.

Also after the War of the Pacific, administrative organization began, which in the case of Mejillones would involve the preparation of urban planning in agreement with the existing type of port. This work was commissioned to naval engineer Emilio de Vitds. The plan, which was perhaps more realistic than those proposed before, was based on 63 city blocks and was completed with the Foundation Act (), signed by president Germán Riesco and dated February 7, 1906.

In 1970, a majority vote approved the bill presented by Mayor Araya Cuadra to build a theater located across the rear of the Plaza Almirante Latorre. The work was carried out with the grant of a loan by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development in the amount of $500,000. Such funding would not satisfy the completion of the project, and work stopped in 1972 pending the granting of a loan extension that failed to materialize by the time of the coup of the Armed Forces of September 11th of 1973.

Mejillones is within a sacrifice zone in the Atacama and has eight coal-fired power stations as of 2024. Pollution of the seabed has resulted in a decline in fishing in the area.

==Demographics==
According to data from the 2002 census by the National Institute of Statistics, the Mejillones commune has 10,042 inhabitants; of these, 7,888 (78.6%) live in urban areas and 530 (5.3%) in rural areas. At that time, there were 4,654 men and 3,764 women residing in the commune. In the ten years since the previous census of 1992 (pop. 6,315), the population grew 33.3% (2,103 persons). It is expected to grow after the construction of , due to be Chile&#x27;s biggest sea port, expected to be completed around 2030.

==Administration==
As a commune, Mejillones is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years.

Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Mejillones is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Pedro Araya (PRI) and Manuel Rojas (UDI) as part of the 4th electoral district, together with Antofagasta, Sierra Gorda, and Taltal. The commune is represented in the Senate by Carlos Cantero Ojeda (Ind.) and José Antonio Gómez Urrutia (PRSD) as part of the 2nd senatorial constituency (Antofagasta Region).

<text>Dr. Walter Gross (written Groß in German) (21 October 1904 in Kassel – 25 April 1945 in Berlin) was a German physician appointed to create the Office for Enlightenment on Population Policy and Racial Welfare (&quot;Aufklärungsamt für Bevölkerungspolitik und Rassenpflege&quot;) for the Nazi Party. He headed this office, renamed the Office of Racial Policy (&quot;Rassenpolitisches Amt&quot;) in 1934, until his suicide at the close of World War II.

== Life and career ==
Walter Gross was born in Kassel on 21 October 1904. Mandated territorial losses consequent to the Treaty of Versailles forced the relocation of young Walter (then 15 years old) and his parents from eastern Germany in 1919. Gross studied medicine at the University of Göttingen, where he was attracted to and joined its reactionary antisemitic socio-political circles. 

While training as a physician in 1925, he became a member of the Nazi Party (&quot;Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei &quot; or NSDAP). Gross obtained his doctorate from Göttingen in 1929 and worked as a physician in Braunschweig between 1929 and 1932. He was appointed leader of the National Socialist German Doctors&#x27; Alliance in 1932. Gross was an anti-Semite, committed believer of German racial purity, and called for the extermination of the Jews. He and Alfred Rosenberg held similar opinions on the alleged threats posed by racial contamination and the presence of Jews in Germany. 

In 1933, Gross was appointed to create the National Socialist Office for Enlightenment on Population Policy and Racial Welfare, which was designed to educate the public and build support for the Nazi sterilization program and other &quot;ethnic improvement&quot; schemes through the 1930s. This was termed &quot;enlightenment&quot; rather than &quot;propaganda&quot; by Nazi authorities, because it was not a call for immediate action but for a long-term change in attitude, aiming at undermining the view where people thought of themselves as individuals rather than as single links in the great chain of life. In its first year, it published fourteen pamphlets for racial education. In 1933, Gross founded a mass-market glossy magazine, &quot;Neues Volk&quot;, which achieved wide popularity. 

Historian Dan Stone explains that as a key leader on Nazi racial policies, the &quot;task of making racial propaganda simple and consistent fell to Walter Gross&quot;. Echoing Stone&#x27;s comments, historian Wolfgang Bialas likewise quipped that Gross was &quot;entrusted with the racial education of Germans, who should from that point on be encouraged to develop biased biological sentiments&quot;. In this role, Gross promulgated the message of Aryan procreation to German women explicitly, evidenced by a speech he gave on 13 October 1934. Also in 1934, Gross published his fanatically antisemitic book, &quot;Rasse und Politik&quot; (Race and Politics). Gross insisted that human inequality itself was a &quot;fact of nature&quot; and notions of &quot;human equality stood in contrast&quot; to it. Instead of focusing on the racial value of each individual, Gross made the &quot;Volkskörper&quot; or &quot;racial body&quot; the &quot;measurement of social value and worth&quot; and enthusiastically contended it was the &quot;voice of the blood streaming through history&quot; that would be a counterweight to Jewish ideals of effete democracy. 

Unlike some Nazi racial ideologues who idealized Germany&#x27;s distant Nordic relatives, Gross recommended caution with this theory, so as not to alienate or cause feelings of inferiority with the German population in any way. Over time, he signaled for the racial anthropological theories associated with Nordicism to &quot;adopt a lower public profile&quot;, while hereditary psychology gained comparative favor regarding inherited characteristics along with evolutionary biology and human genetics. 

Gross participated in a meeting at the NSDAP Supreme Party Court in Munich during December 1934 along with other Nazi authorities on genealogical and racial matters. This late 1934 meeting included: Dr. Rudolf Kummer from the Bavarian State Ministry for Instruction and Education, the leader and founder of the Reich Association of Kinship Researchers and Heraldists, Achim Gercke, the leader of the National Socialist German Doctors&#x27; League, Gerhard Wagner, and the General Commissioner for Medical and Health Service, Dr. Karl Brandt, who was ultimately responsible for overseeing the T4 extermination program; this assemblage of &quot;experts&quot; was called together to establish the Nazis&#x27; fundamental position on &quot;racial policy&quot;. To this end, Gross played an important role &quot;in the formulation of both the eugenic legislation and the Nuremberg racial laws&quot; enacted by the Nazi regime. 

After a committee meeting of &quot;racial experts&quot; brought together in March 1935 to deliberate the fate of Germany&#x27;s Rhineland bastards, Gross recommended—following an anthropological investigation—that they all be compulsorily sterilized; a task carried out by 1937. Another problematic area that came to the attention of Gross and demanded a solution—beyond sterilizing certain groups—was the alleged impact to the German people brought on by caring for the weak and crippled. Such thinking eventually contributed to the formation of the Nazi euthanasia program, where a vast array of factors (including many highly subjective illnesses) were cited as justification for murdering persons under the auspices of racial cleansing. 

Sometime in 1938, Gross was made an honorary professor and taught racial anthropology at the University of Berlin. That same year, Gross, then head of the Reich Bureau for Enlightenment on Population Policy and Racial Welfare, contributed a chapter entitled &quot;National Socialist Racial Thought&quot; to an English language book, &quot;Germany Speaks&quot;, wherein he elaborates with religious fervor the usual pseudo-scientific Nazi rhetoric about Aryan racial purity, the dangers of foreign blood, the need for additional arable soil, as well as the menace caused by Jews and other identified Nazi enemies. According to the Nazi worldview and Gross in particular, the world was not a single humanity but consisted only of varied groups of peoples &quot;with certain racial characteristics and hybridizations&quot;. Messaging from Gross remained consistently focused on race, indicated by his pamphlet &quot;You and Your Volk&quot;—disseminated at the beginning of the war—which urged German soldiers to think racially at all times. Even asocial people within the German population were not safe from Nazi categorization by Gross, who in a 1940 speech, avowed their problems were not derived via environmental determinism but were inescapably and immutably a part of their familial heritage. 

Along with Peter Heinz Seraphim, Gross was one of the only academics to speak publicly in support of the Final Solution of the Jewish Question as early as March 1941. 

In a 1943 brochure designed for the Hitler Youth, Gross railed against the dangers of foreign blood threatening German purity and stated therein that racial policy would be ineffective &quot;without a clear awareness of our own blood, self-respect, and racial pride&quot;. One of his later pseudo-scientific works—written in 1943 as the Final Solution was being carried out—evoked &quot;zoological anti-semitism&quot; and contained verbiage portending the horrors of Nazi carnage; its title for posterity, &quot;Die rassenpolitischen Voraussetzungen zur Lösung der Judenfrage&quot; (The Racial Political Prerequisites for Solving the Jewish Question). Between 1942 and 1945, Gross acted as one of the heads with the Rosenberg Bureau. 

Throughout his career, Gross advocated for sterner measures against the Jews to Nazi policymakers, and while he never attained the levels of power and influence achieved by Adolf Eichmann or Reinhard Heydrich, his &quot;blend of scientific vocabulary&quot; appealed to and impressed the highest levels of Nazi leadership since it accorded with their views on race and justified aggression.

===Final days and death===
As late as March 1945, Gross was still sending reports from his Racial Policy Office to the Party Chancellery concerning ethnic matters. Covering some of his own tracks, Gross burned his files in Berlin at the closing of World War II, thereby, in the opinion of Claudia Koonz, erasing significant evidence &quot;that would have incriminated the more than 3,000 members of his national network of racial educators.&quot;

Gross committed suicide on 25 April 1945, shortly before the German surrender.

<text>Luiz Felipe Scolari (; born 9 November 1948), also known as Felipão (&quot;Big Phil&quot;), is a Brazilian football manager and former player.

Considered to be one of the greatest and most successful managers of all time by several pundits, Scolari was a defender during his playing days, and notably represented Caxias before moving to a managerial role in 1982. After leading the Brazil national team to a FIFA World Cup win in 2002, he was manager of the Portugal national team from July 2003 to June 2008. He led Portugal to the final of UEFA Euro 2004, which they lost 0–1 to Greece, and to a fourth-place finish in the 2006 World Cup. Scolari also managed Portugal through UEFA Euro 2008, but resigned after a 2–3 loss to Germany in the second round.

After a return to club management at Chelsea in the Premier League, Scolari was hired again as manager of the Brazil national team in 2012. He led them to victory at the 2013 Confederations Cup, and to the semi-final in the 2014 World Cup. After the Brazil national team finished fourth overall in an upset 1–7 loss to Germany in the semi-finals, and a 0–3 loss to the Netherlands in the third-place playoff, the Brazilian Football Confederation decided not to renew his contract. In 2015, he started work at Guangzhou Evergrande and went on to claim both the 2015 Chinese Super League and 2015 AFC Champions League in his first season with the club. He returned to Palmeiras in 2018, winning his second Brazilian league title that year.

Scolari is a dual citizen of Brazil and Italy, as he is descended from Italian immigrants.

==Playing career==
Scolari was born in Passo Fundo, Rio Grande do Sul. A defender regarded as more uncompromising than skillful, he was known among his contemporaries as &quot;Perna-de-Pau&quot; (literally translated as &quot;wooden leg&quot; in Portuguese, a Brazilian slang for a bad player), Scolari followed in the footsteps of his father, Benjamin Scolari, who was also a professional footballer. His playing career encompassed spells with Caxias, Juventude, Novo Hamburgo, and CSA; he often captained his sides. It was with CSA that he won his only major title as a player – the 1981 Campeonato Alagoano.

==Style of play==
A central defender, Scolari described himself as a player who was tough, physically strong, and who had a good positional sense and leadership qualities, despite not being a particularly skilful player, which made him a useful player for his teams. Throughout his career he was nicknamed &quot;Perna-de-Pau,&quot; or &quot;Wooden Leg,&quot; in Portuguese, due to his perceived lack of class on the ball.

==Managerial career==

===Early career===
Upon retiring as a player in 1982, he was appointed manager of CSA, his former club, and would go on to win the Alagoas state championship in his first season. After spells with Juventude (twice), Brasil de Pelotas and Pelotas and Saudi Arabian side Al Shabab, he moved to Grêmio, where he won the 1987 Gaúcho state championship. After managing Goiás, Scolari had a two-year stint in charge of Kuwaiti side Qadsia, with whom he won the prestigious Kuwait Emir Cup in 1989. This was followed by a brief period as manager of the Kuwait national team, winning the 10th Gulf Cup in Kuwait. Scolari returned to Brazil to coach Coritiba. He stayed for just three matches, losing all of them. After the last loss, he abandoned the club by boarding the winning team&#x27;s bus back to his hometown; and did not return even to collect his wages. Scolari coached Criciúma to their first major national title, in the 1991 Copa do Brasil. He returned to club management in the Middle East, managing Al-Ahli and a second spell at Qadsia.

===Return to Grêmio===
In 1993, Scolari returned to Grêmio, where, albeit leading the team to historic victories, he was criticized by the Brazilian media for playing a pragmatic style of football regarded as &quot;un-Brazilian&quot;. He claimed six titles in only three years, including the 1995 Copa Libertadores, which qualified Grêmio for the Intercontinental Cup, which they lost to Dutch side Ajax on penalties. The following year, they won the Brazilian Championship.

His team featured no real superstar and depended on workman-like players such as Paraguayan right back Francisco Arce, tough-tackling midfielder Dinho, Paulo Nunes, and centre forward Mário Jardel.

===Júbilo Iwata===
In 1997, Scolari became manager of J. League side Júbilo Iwata, but left after eleven games and shortly afterwards took charge of Palmeiras back in Brazil.

===Palmeiras===
In three years as manager, Scolari led Palmeiras to the Copa do Brasil, the Mercosur Cup, and their first Copa Libertadores title with a win on penalties over Deportivo Cali of Colombia. They were also runners-up to Manchester United in the 1999 Intercontinental Cup. He was named South American Coach of the Year for 1999.

===Cruzeiro===
In 2000, Scolari was appointed to manage Minas Gerais club Cruzeiro, coaching them for a year.

===Brazil===
In June 2001, Scolari was appointed manager of his native Brazil, the team&#x27;s third coach in the space of a year. With five qualifying matches ahead, the team were in jeopardy of not qualifying for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, which would be a first in the Brazilian competitive record. Despite losing his first match 1–0 to Uruguay, and also suffering a 2–1 defeat to rivals Argentina in September, Scolari eventually guided the team to qualification for the tournament. He also led the team through the 2001 Copa América, where they were unexpectedly eliminated in the quarter-finals by Honduras following a 2–0 defeat. After the match, Scolari commented: &quot;I will go down in history as the Brazil coach who lost to Honduras – it&#x27;s horrible. But Honduras played better, they deserved their win.&quot;

In the build-up to the 2002 World Cup finals, Scolari refused to include veteran striker Romário in his squad, despite public pressure and a tearful appeal from the player himself. Brazil entered the tournament unfancied, but wins over Turkey, China, Costa Rica, Belgium, England and Turkey again took them to the final, where they beat Germany 2–0 with two goals from Ronaldo to win their fifth FIFA World Cup title. Scolari resigned in August 2002, intending to move to Europe.

===Portugal===
In November 2002 Scolari was appointed coach of Portugal, who would be the host nation for UEFA Euro 2004. The appointment was controversial as Scolari was highly paid, and was the first foreigner to coach Portugal since Otto Glória. Scolari caused more controversy by calling up Brazil-born Deco, who had only recently become eligible for Portuguese citizenship. At Euro 2004, Portugal got through the group stages and saw off England in the quarter-finals on penalties before beating the Netherlands in the semi-finals. In the final, however, they were beaten in a 1–0 upset by tournament underdogs Greece. Scolari managed Portugal through the 2006 World Cup in Germany, where they reached the semi-finals, again coming out victorious in the quarterfinals against England. But they did not reach the final due to a semifinal defeat against eventual runners-up France. Following the tournament, Scolari was strongly linked with the job of England manager, but chose to see out his contract with Portugal.

Scolari took Portugal to Euro 2008, where they reached the knock-out stages by placing first in Group A before being eliminated by Germany in the quarter-finals. During the tournament, he announced that he would be joining English Premier League side Chelsea for the 2008–09 season.

===Chelsea===

Scolari took over as manager of Chelsea on 1 July 2008. This was announced shortly after Portugal&#x27;s Euro 2008 match against the Czech Republic on 11 June. With this appointment, Scolari became the first World Cup-winning manager to manage in the Premier League. In previous press conferences, Scolari had talked about &quot;tantrums&quot; and &quot;triumphs&quot; and had a reputation as a tough and unpredictable person. When asked whether his decision to join Chelsea was financial, he responded, &quot;Yes, that is one of the reasons,&quot; but also added, &quot;I&#x27;m 59 and I don&#x27;t want to work as a coach until I&#x27;m 70. I want to retire in four or five years, so it was a financial matter but there are other things.&quot; He also said, &quot;I could offer my son the opportunity to study elsewhere. You only get this kind of opportunity once so you take it or leave it, but it was not only financial.&quot; Scolari later said that he had turned down an offer to manage Manchester City.

Scolari&#x27;s first match in charge of Chelsea was a friendly match against Chinese side Guangzhou Pharmaceutical, a 4–0 victory. He made Barcelona midfielder Deco, a player he was familiar with on the Portugal national team, his first signing for a fee of around £8 million, but was subsequently frustrated in his attempts to sign Brazilian international Robinho from Real Madrid. Under Scolari, Chelsea had the biggest away win of the club in five years in which Chelsea won 5–0 at the Riverside Stadium in October 2008. It was also the club&#x27;s biggest win ever at Middlesbrough.

Scolari was sacked as Chelsea manager on 9 February 2009 after a run of poor form culminating in a 2–0 defeat at Liverpool followed by frustrating 0–0 home draw with Hull City. The club&#x27;s stated reason for his removal was that &quot;the results and performances of the team appeared to be deteriorating at a key time in the season&quot;. Scolari&#x27;s replacement at Chelsea for the remainder of the 2008–09 season was Dutch manager Guus Hiddink, who simultaneously managed the Russia national team.

===Bunyodkor===
On 6 June 2009, Scolari was spotted in attendance at Uzbekistan&#x27;s World Cup qualifier against Japan; on 8 June 2009, Scolari revealed that he had signed an 18-month contract with the Uzbekistani champions FC Bunyodkor. The contract made Scolari the highest paid football manager in the world, earning €13 million a year.

He left by mutual consent on 29 May 2010 after failing to guide Bunyodkor past the last 16 in the AFC Champions League, although he cited concern regarding his son&#x27;s education as the key reason.

===Return to Palmeiras===
On 13 June 2010, Scolari was announced as Palmeiras&#x27; new manager. He signed a -year contract. Palmeiras were 2012 Copa do Brasil champions under his management. In September 2012, Scolari left by mutual consent after an unsatisfying result in the Campeonato Brasileiro.

===Return to Brazil===
In November 2012, after two months without a club, Scolari returned to managing the Brazil national team, replacing the outgoing Mano Menezes. He was tasked with securing a win in the 2014 FIFA World Cup, in which Brazil would be hosts. Scolari had previously won the 2002 FIFA World Cup as manager of Brazil.

Under Scolari, Brazil beat Japan 3–0 in the opening game of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, with goals from Neymar in the third minute, Paulinho in the 48th minute and Jô on the 90th minute. Three days later, his team won 2–0 over Mexico, with Neymar scoring again in the ninth minute.

Brazil defeated Uruguay 2–1 in the semi-final match of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup in a tough draw, with goals from Fred in the 41st minute paired with a late goal from Paulinho in the 86th minute. In the final, Brazil defeated Spain 3–0 with two goals from Fred and one from Neymar.

After a successful campaign which earned them a semi-final spot in the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Brazil were defeated 7–1 in an upset loss against Germany at the semi-final stage, which became their biggest-ever defeat at the World Cup (their largest margin of defeat was previously losing 3-0 to France in the 1998 final), the record for most goals conceded in their World Cup track record and its first home loss in a competitive match since 1975. Scolari described the match as &quot;the worst day of [his] life&quot;, and took responsibility for the loss.

On 14 July 2014, following a further 3–0 defeat in the third place playoff match against the Netherlands, Scolari resigned from his position as Brazilian manager.

===Third return to Grêmio===
On 29 July 2014, Scolari signed with Grêmio. He was officially unveiled by the club the following day at the Arena do Grêmio. On 19 May 2015, Scolari resigned from his position after a poor start to the season.

===Guangzhou Evergrande===
On 4 June 2015, Scolari was appointed head coach of Chinese Super League champions Guangzhou Evergrande, signing a one-and-a-half plus one-year contract. After four months in charge, Scolari led the club to victory in the 2015 Chinese Super League and AFC Champions League, defeating Cosmin Olăroiu&#x27;s Al-Ahli side with a 1–0 aggregate win in the final. He extended his contract for one year on 24 October 2016 after his potential successor Marcello Lippi was appointed as the manager of China national team. Scolari led Guangzhou win three consecutive league titles from 2015 to 2017. He refused to extend his contract again by the end of 2017 season.

===Third return to Palmeiras===
On 27 July 2018, Scolari returned to Brazilian side Palmeiras for a third time. On 2 September 2019, Scolari would be fired by club, that is under a poor performance after 2019 Copa America; in this period, Scolari gained only 23.8% of points played by Palmeiras.

===Return to Cruzeiro===
On 15 October 2020, Scolari returned to manage the football team of Cruzeiro. On 25 January 2021, Scolari and Cruzeiro parted ways by mutual agreement.

===Fourth return to Grêmio===
On 7 July 2021, Scolari returned to Grêmio for the fourth time, with the goal of moving the team out of the last place in the Brasileiro Série A and fighting for the Copa Sudamericana. He left on a mutual agreement on 11 October, with the club second bottom of the league.

===Athletico Paranaense===
On 4 May 2022, Scolari was hired by Athletico Paranaense as a technical director, being also a manager of the first team &quot;until new definitions&quot;. With favorable results, he ended up coaching the side for the remainder of the season, leading them to the 2022 Copa Libertadores final, lost 1–0 to Flamengo. He stepped down as head coach and continued at the club solely as a director in the 2023 season, appointing his assistant Paulo Turra as his successor.

===Atlético Mineiro===
On 16 June 2023, Scolari accepted an offer to resume his coaching career at Atlético Mineiro, signing a one-and-a-half-year deal. He led the club to an impressive run in the 2023 Série A, but left on a mutual agreement on 20 March 2024, despite the club being in the 2024 Campeonato Mineiro finals.

==Personal life==
Scolari also holds Italian citizenship, since his family emigrated from Veneto. He is a fan of Grêmio, and was reported to be a fan of Nottingham Forest, having watched their successes under Brian Clough in the 1970s. Scolari is a Roman Catholic.

During his career, the media has been fond of pointing out Scolari&#x27;s facial resemblance to actor Gene Hackman and Marlon Brando&#x27;s portrayal of Don Vito Corleone in the film &quot;The Godfather&quot;. In Brazil, Scolari is also known as &quot;Felipão&quot;, and during his stint with Chelsea, he was sometimes referred by the English translation, Big Phil.

==Style of management==
Considered to be one of the greatest and successful managers of all time by several pundits, in 2024 &quot;90min.com&quot; attributed Scolari&#x27;s success to his unpredictable, authoritarian, and &quot;enigmatic style, with his ability to inspire his players proving to be as important as his tactical prowess.&quot; Nicknamed &quot;Felipão,&quot; or &quot;Big Phil,&quot; in Portuguese, in the early part of his coaching career, he was known for his no-nonsense style of football. However, in the 1990s, he adopted a more attractive style of play, and his teams became more clinical offensively. He was also known for fostering a team spirit and for using religion-inspired motivational techniques, and attempted to shelter his teams from the media. His relationship with the press was often complicated, however, due to his passionate and temperamental style, which saw him involved in conflicts with journalists. He was also known for his intensity on the sidelines.

Throughout his career, Scolari was known for his balanced tactical approach defensively and offensively, as well as his flexibility, adopting several different formations, including the 4–3–2–1, 3–4–1–2, and 4–3–3. He often gave his players lots of freedom on the pitch. The midfielders were paramount to his sides&#x27; offensive strategy, as they were required to make funs through central areas. The gameplay of his wingers was also an important part of his tactical approach, as he often had them switch positions in order to provide a diverse range of attacking plays for his team.

With Grêmio and Palmeiras, he often used a 4–4–2 formation, which was solid defensively, and which made use of quick transitions and counter-attacks. During his first stint as Brazil&#x27;s manager, he initially played a more defensive style, but took a more attacking approach during the 2002 World Cup, using a 3–5–2, 3–4–1–2, or 3–4–2–1 formation with Cafu and Roberto Carlos as attacking wing-backs supporting the front line, which complemented the ability of his team&#x27;s talented forwards – Ronaldo, Rivaldo, and Ronaldinho, as well as the passing ability of his midfielders. His side also made use of quick transitions and counter-attacks.

With Portugal, Scolari also adopted an entertaining playing style based on passing, which highlighted the skill of his players, but also placed an emphasis on tactical preparation, pragmatism, and the psychological aspect of the game. Former Portugal midfielder Deco praised Scolari for his ability to motivate the team during the 2006 World Cup. During the latter tournament, Scolari used a 4–2–3–1 formation with wingers Cristiano Ronaldo and Luís Figo on the left and right flanks respectively, often switching sides and running at opposing defenders.

During his second stint with Brazil, Scolari instead adopted a flexible 4–2–3–1 and successfully stifled Spain&#x27;s possession during the 2013 Confederations Cup final through the use of heavy pressing, in particular on the opposing team&#x27;s holding midfielder Sergio Busquets. He also made use of a solid defence, who played a high line, hard-working box-to-box midfielders, and used Oscar as an attacking midfielder, who was given defensive responsibilities but also the freedom to join the attack, while Neymar played as a left winger, supporting a genuine lone centre-forward upfront.

<text>James William Mitchell (12 March 1926, in South Shields – 15 September 2002, in Newcastle-upon-Tyne) was a British writer, principally of crime fiction and spy thrillers. He is best known for creating &quot;Callan&quot; (1967–1972) and &quot;When the Boat Comes In&quot; (1976–1981).

==Biography==

The son of a shipyard worker, Mitchell also wrote under the pseudonyms James Munro and Patrick O. McGuire. He received BA and MA degrees from Oxford. After graduating he tried numerous jobs, including shipyard worker and civil servant before taking up teaching, in his own words he taught, &quot;for some 15 years in almost every kind of institution from secondary modern school to college of art&quot;. In 1968 Mitchell moved to London to concentrate on writing.

Mitchell created the ITV spy thriller &quot;Callan&quot;, starring Edward Woodward as a remorseful secret service assassin, and the BBC period drama &quot;When the Boat Comes In&quot;, starring James Bolam as a World War I veteran returning to his Tyneside hometown. These programmes proved to be his most notable, and acclaimed work.

He also wrote many other television scripts, including episodes of &quot;The Troubleshooters&quot;, the legal drama &quot;Justice&quot; and &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
He married twice and had two children. Mitchell died in Newcastle upon Tyne on 15 September 2002. He was 76.

<doc id="751884" wikidata="Q648042" url="?curid=751884" title="Non-subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland">
<text>The Non-subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland is a non-creedal Christian denomination, which maintains a great emphasis on individual conscience in matters of Christian faith. Today, the denomination has thirty-four congregations (thirty-three churches) on the island of Ireland, divided into two Presbyteries and one synod, with a total of about four thousand members. The denomination currently has twenty-five ministers on its roll with both women and men serving as ministers. The NSCPI is also a member of the International Association for Religious Freedom. It has also recorded year-on-year growth in recent years.
 
Non-subscribing Presbyterians continue to maintain a strong commitment to the worship of God, the person of Christ, and the centrality of Scripture. This is in accordance with &#x27;The Constitution and Code of Discipline&#x27; (1997) of the denomination, which states:

&quot;That the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament are the rule of Christian Faith and Duty under the teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot; and &quot;That it is the inalienable right of every Christian to search these records of Divine Truth for his instruction and guidance, to form his own opinions with regard to what they teach and to worship God in sincerity, agreeably to the dictates of his conscience, without privation, penalty or inconvenience by his fellow-men.&quot;

Whilst it continues, for historic reasons, friendly relations with the Unitarian and Free Christian General Assembly, it does not share the latter&#x27;s &#x27;post-Christian&#x27; outlook and remains firmly part of the Christian family of faith. In common with most Protestant churches they affirm the two Biblical Sacraments of communion and baptism. Baptism is usually performed using the wording from Matthew 28, and this usage has increased in many places in recent years.

The Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland is a founder of, and active within, the Irish Council of Churches and the European Liberal Protestant Network (ELPN). The Church became part of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches on its foundation in 1928, although it is now recognised under the terms of the 2010 Accord with the General Assembly as an independent and fully functioning denomination in its own right.

==History==
The Church has its origins with early 18th-century Presbyterian ministers who refused to subscribe at their ordination to the Westminster Confession, a standard Reformed (Calvinist) statement of faith; and who were placed, in 1725, in the Presbytery of Antrim. A similar disagreement led to the creation of the Remonstrant Synod of Ulster in 1830. In 1835 the two bodies together with the Synod of Munster formed the Association of Irish Non-subscribing Presbyterians. However, the foundation of the earliest of Irish Presbyterian congregations predates the formulation of the Westminster Confession, and the congregations of the Synod of Munster never subscribed to this. When the Presbytery of Antrim was formed, it received support from the Synod of Munster. As the eighteenth century progressed, the attitude to subscription within the Synod of Ulster became more relaxed.

The Non-subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland (NSPCI) was consolidated in 1910 when the Presbytery of Antrim, the Remonstrant Synod of Ulster, and those congregations that had formed the Free Congregational Union (a radical group made up of a few congregations who had left the Remonstrant Synod or the Presbytery of Antrim) for a few years, formed the General Synod. By 1910 only three congregations of the original Synod of Munster remained in the south of Ireland. Although (like all the elements that came to form the General Synod in 1910) the Synod of Munster was and remained a member of the Association of Irish Non-subscribing Presbyterians, it did not formally join the General Synod until 1935.

==Statement of uniting principles==
The Non-subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland has a statement of uniting principles, which are:

&quot;We declare allegiance to the principle that:
* The teaching of Christ must take precedence over the doctrines of a later time, and
* Christian unity is to be sought, not in the uniformity of creed but in a common standard of duty and adherence to the commandments set out in the Bible.

Our faith:
* is governed by the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible
* asserts and upholds the right of every individual to search these scriptural records for themselves and to use reason and personal conscience to discover God’s Divine Truth
* removes Human Tests and Confessions of Faith that restrict private judgment and prevent free enquiry
* upholds the beautiful simplicity of the great commandments as defined by Jesus Christ: “You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul and all your mind” and “You must love your neighbour as yourself.”

==Structure==
The denomination is constituted of two Presbyteries and one synod: the Presbytery of Antrim with 16 churches, the Presbytery of Bangor with 13 churches, and the Synod of Munster with four churches. The Unitarian churches of Dublin and Cork publish a monthly magazine titled &quot;Oscailt&quot;. The denomination publishes its own monthly magazine called &quot;Inspiration&quot;.

==Presbytery of Antrim==
In 1725, the Synod of Ulster formed a new Presbytery of Antrim, consisting of the following 16 congregations:

* Aghadowey - John Elder - the congregation rejoined the Synod of Ulster after his resignation in or before 1773
* Ahoghill - Thomas Shaw - the congregation rejoined the Synod of Ulster after his death in 1731
* Antrim - John Abernethy
* Ballyclare - Thomas Wilson
* 1st Belfast - Samuel Haliday
* 2nd Belfast - James Kirkpatrick
* Cairncastle - William Taylor
* Comber - John Orr - the current non-subscribing congregation was not founded until 1838
* Downpatrick - Thomas Nevin
* Dromore - ? Colvil
* Dundalk - Patrick Simpson - the congregation rejoined the Synod of Ulster after his death in or before 1779
* Duneane - John Henderson - the congregation rejoined the Synod of Ulster after his death in 1753
* Holywood - Michael Bruce
* Larne - Josias Clugston
* Moira - Samuel Harpur - the congregation rejoined the Synod of Ulster after his death in or before 1731
* Newtownards - John Mears

Newtownlimavady, under Joseph Osborne, is included in a list given by James Armstrong in &quot;A summary history of the Presbyterian churches in the City of Dublin&quot;. However, William Dool Killen in &quot;History of the congregations of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland&quot; states that Osborne&#x27;s ordination by the Presbytery of Antrim occurred after 1740. He and his congregation joined the Synod of Ulster in 1743.

<doc id="751891" wikidata="Q1848855" url="?curid=751891" title="United States Botanic Garden">
<text>The United States Botanic Garden (USBG) is a botanical garden on the grounds of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., near the James A. Garfield Monument.

The Botanic Garden is supervised by the Congress through the Architect of the Capitol, who is responsible for maintaining the grounds of the United States Capitol. The USBG is open every day of the year, including federal holidays. It is the oldest continually-operating botanic garden in the United States.

== History ==
The Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences in Washington, DC first suggested the creation of the Botanic Garden in 1816. In 1820 it was given land by an act of Congress. The land was located west of the Capitol extending from First Street to Third Street between Pennsylvania and Maryland Avenues. The facility ceased to operate in 1837 when the society stopped holding meetings. However it was re-instituted in 1842 when the Wilkes expedition of the South Seas brought back a collection of plants.

In 1838, Charles Wilkes set out on the United States Exploring Expedition commissioned by Congress to circumnavigate the globe and explore the Pacific Ocean. During this trip (the &quot;Wilkes Expedition&quot;), Wilkes collected live and dried specimens of plants and was one of the first to use wardian cases to maintain live plants on long voyages. Wilkes returned in 1842 with a massive collection of plants previously unknown in the United States.

The dried specimens comprised the core of what is now the National Herbarium, an herbarium curated by the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of Natural History. The live specimens and seeds came to be housed in the Old Patent Office greenhouse, and were cared for there until 1850. At that time, a botanic garden was built to house the collection in front of the Capitol, where the Capitol reflecting pool is now located.

Abolitionist Photius Fisk conducted scientific exploration of minerals and plants. While he was U.S. Navy chaplain on the Frigate Raritan in South America and the Pacific he collected seeds and rare plants for the United States Botanic Garden. Some of the species he gathered were the vanilla plant, dendrobium, cattleya, epidendrum, stanhopea, and several other named and unnamed species. Most of the flowers were from Brazil. He also obtained the rare butterfly flower Oncidium Papilio from Saint Thomas which he carefully guarded. Photius Fisk kept careful notes of his observations of the plants. In February 1853, he immediately traveled to Washington and gave the plants to the superintendent and botanist of the United States Botanic Garden W. D. Breckenridge.

In 1933, the building was moved to its present location, just to the southwest of the Capitol, bordered by Maryland Avenue on the north, First Street on the east, Independence Avenue on the south, and Third Street on the west.

The building was closed for renovations on September 1, 1997, and reopened to the public on December 11, 2001. At the time of closure for renovation, plants in the collection were either placed in storage at the USBG Production Facility, retired to greenhouses in Florida, or composted.

== Facilities ==

The USBG proper consists of three locations: the Conservatory, Bartholdi Park, and the Production Facility.

The Conservatory is a conservatory housed in a Lord &amp; Burnham greenhouse. It is divided into separate rooms, each simulating a different habitat:
* The Garden Court
* Rare and Endangered Plants (rare species, endangered species)
* Plant Exploration
* Orchid House (orchids)
* Medicinal Plants (medicinal plants)
* Desert (desert species)
* Hawaii
* Garden Primeval (primeval)
* Plant Adaptation
* Jungle (jungle species; this is the largest of the rooms, and includes a second-story catwalk so that the jungle canopy may be observed from both below and above)
* Children&#x27;s Garden (courtyard; features many thriving temperate annuals used to encourage interest in plants)
* Southern Exposure (courtyard), on the south side of the building, is surrounded by glass walls, receiving more warmth. It features many plants from the Southeast and Southwest, which would not be able to live in the colder District of Columbia climate if not for the microclimate)

Except for the Hawaiian house, the galleries, and the south lobby, none of the conservatory has air conditioning. Each room is closely monitored by computer-operated sensors to maintain the environment best suited to the plants in that room. Humidity, sunlight and temperature are regulated by means of a misting system, retractable shades and levered windows. All plants are watered daily by hand. Construction was completed on the National Garden on the Botanic Garden&#x27;s west border, in October 2006 and the garden includes a regional garden of plants native to the Atlantic Coastal Plain and Piedmont, a rose garden, a butterfly garden, and the First Ladies Water Garden, a water garden in memory of the First Ladies of the United States.The National Garden construction was funded by the National Fund for the U.S. Botanic Garden which now exists as a &#x27;friends group&#x27;.

Bartholdi Park lies just south of the Conservatory, across Independence Avenue. It is named for the Bartholdi Fountain in the garden&#x27;s center designed by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi. One of the goals of this garden is to provide inspiration and ideas for home gardeners who visit it. It displays a variety of small structured and non-structured gardens, and infuses color, shape, and planting themes. One section of the garden is certified as a National Wildlife Federation Backyard Wildlife Habitat. The Park also houses the administrative building for the United States Botanic Garden.

The Production Facility in southwest D.C. is used for growing and storing plants for propagation, for collection maintenance, or for display in upcoming annual shows.

The USBG participates in CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species), which means that it cares for plants seized by Customs. It specializes in orchids and succulents.

== Wilkes Plants ==
There are four plants in the garden that are believed to be directly related to the original Wilkes Expedition.

* The Vessel Fern (&quot;Angiopteris evecta&quot;) situated in the Jungle, is a fern believed to be the direct progeny of the Vessel Fern brought back on Wilkes&#x27; ship. Because of the lifespan of Vessel Ferns, it is highly unlikely that the present fern is the original; however it is believed that the present fern is a direct descendant and genetically identical to the original.
* The Ferocious Blue Cycad (&quot;Encephalartos horridus&quot;) is a cycad questionably one of the original Wilkes plants. Due to its size and possible age, some believe this plant to have come back with the expedition in 1842; unfortunately, early records are incomplete and inaccurate, so this is left to speculation.
* The Queen Sagos Cycas circinalis, which are cycads, live in the Garden Court. The Botanic Garden cares for both a male and a female of the species, and both were brought back with the Wilkes Expedition.

<text>USS &quot;Adder&quot; (Submarine Torpedo Boat No. 3), later renamed &quot;A-2&quot;, was one of seven s built for the United States Navy (USN) in the first decade of the 20th century.

==Construction==
&quot;Adder&quot; was laid down on 3 October 1900 at the Crescent Shipyard, Elizabethport, New Jersey, by Lewis Nixon, a subcontractor for the Holland Torpedo Boat Company, New York City; launched on 22 July 1901; sponsored by Mrs. Jane S. Wainwright, wife of Rear Admiral Richard Wainwright. &quot;Adder&quot; was commissioned on 12 January 1903 at the Holland Torpedo Boat Station at New Suffolk, New York with Ensign Frank L. Pinney in command. She was the second submarine commissioned in the United States Navy after USS &quot;Holland&quot; (SS-1).

==Design==
The &quot;Plunger&quot;-class submarines were enlarged and improved versions of the preceding , the first submarine in the USN. They had a length of overall, a beam of and a mean draft of . They displaced on the surface and submerged. The &quot;Plunger&quot;-class boats had a crew of one officer and six enlisted men. They had a diving depth of .

For surface running, they were powered by one gasoline engine that drove the single propeller. When submerged the propeller was driven by a electric motor. The boats could reach on the surface and underwater.

The &quot;Plunger&quot;-class boats were armed with one torpedo tube in the bow. They carried two reloads, for a total of three torpedoes.

==Service history==
After initial experimental duty at the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, &quot;Adder&quot; was towed to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard by the tug &quot;Peoria&quot;, arriving there on 4 December 1903. In January 1904, the submarine torpedo boat was assigned to the Reserve Torpedo Flotilla. Placed out of commission on 26 July 1909, &quot;Adder&quot; was loaded onto the collier , and was transported to the Philippines, arriving on 1 October.

Recommissioned on 10 February 1910, she was assigned to duty with the 1st Submarine Division, Asiatic Torpedo Fleet. Over almost a decade, the submarine torpedo boat operated from Cavite and Olongapo, principally in training and experimental work. During this time, she was renamed on 17 November 1911, becoming simply &quot;A-2&quot; (Submarine Torpedo Boat No. 3).

===World War I===
During World War I, she carried out patrols off the entrance to Manila Bay, and around the island of Corregidor. Decommissioned on 12 December 1919, &quot;A-2&quot; (assigned the alphanumeric hull number &quot;SS-3&quot; on 17 July 1920) was designated for use as a target on 24 September 1920. Sunk as a target in mid-January 1922, she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 16 January 1922.

<text>Helena Dahlbäck (1960–2000) was a Swedish author who wrote several children&#x27;s books, such as &quot;My Sister Lotta and Me&quot;.

&quot;My Sister Lotta and Me&quot; was translated into English by Rika Lessar in 1993 and published by Henry Holt &amp; Co. (). It was illustrated by Charlotte Ramel, who also illustrated &quot;The Cake Book&quot;, published by Sprall Publishing, Sweden. In 1996, she was the Nils Holgersson Plaque laureate.

During the 1990s, she shared her time between writing, cultural pedagogical work with children, reading and literature promotion work and her family. She debuted in 1991 with the book My Sister and I who came to be followed by about twenty books. She described this writing process herself as &quot;it was as if my entire secret childish soul life began to bubble over in all directions. I couldn&#x27;t stop it!&quot;.

<doc id="751914" wikidata="Q1065003" url="?curid=751914" title="Charles J. Folger">
<text>Charles James Folger (April 16, 1818 – September 4, 1884) was an American lawyer and politician. A member of the Republican Party, he was a State Senator in New York from 1862 to 1869 and served as the 34th U.S. Secretary of the Treasury from November 14, 1881 until his death in 1884. Folger was the Republican nominee for Governor of New York in 1882, but was defeated by the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee, future President Grover Cleveland.

==Early life==
He was born in 1818 on the island of Nantucket, Massachusetts. When Folger was 12 years old his family moved to Geneva, New York. He later attended Geneva College (now called Hobart and William Smith Colleges), where in 1836 he graduated with honors. After his graduation, he read law with Mark H. Sibley and Alvah Worden in Canandaigua, New York and was admitted to the bar of New York state three years later in 1839. He began his practice in Lyons, New York, but returned to Geneva in 1840, where he remained for the rest of his life. On June 18, 1844, he married Susan Rebecca Worth.

==Public life==

In 1844, Folger was appointed to the bench of the Ontario County Court of Common Pleas, serving for about a year.

He was a Republican member of the New York State Senate (26th D.) from 1862 to 1869, sitting in the 85th, 86th, 87th, 88th, 89th, 90th, 91st and 92nd New York State Legislatures. During his term he served as President pro tempore for four years and as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Folger served as a delegate to the New York State Constitutional Convention of 1867–68 and to the 1868 Republican National Convention.

Folger resigned from the State Senate in 1869, having been appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant to Assistant United States Treasurer in New York City. The following year, Folger was elected one of the first judges of the re-organized New York Court of Appeals. After the death of Sanford E. Church, Folger was appointed Chief Judge by Governor Alonzo B. Cornell on May 20, 1880, to fill the vacancy temporarily. In November he was elected to a full 14-year term as Chief Judge.

He was a member of the &quot;Stalwart&quot; faction of the Republican Party, led by New York senator Roscoe Conkling, which was known during the early Gilded Age for its advocacy of civil rights and opposition towards civil service reform.

In 1881, President James Garfield offered Folger the position of United States Attorney General, which he declined. Later that year, he resigned from the bench to accept an appointment by President Chester Arthur to serve as Secretary of the Treasury. In 1883 he appointed Mifflin E. Bell to the Office of the Supervising Architect for the U.S. Treasury, an agency that designed federal government buildings from 1852 to 1939.

==Gubernatorial race==
While serving as U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Folger ran in 1882 for Governor of New York, but was defeated by Democrat Grover Cleveland.

==Death==
Folger died on September 4, 1884, at his home on Main Street in Geneva, NY. He was buried at Glenwood Cemetery, Geneva, at the side of his wife who had died seven years earlier.

The Geneva Fire Department&#x27;s C.J. Folger Hook &amp; Ladder Co. #1 is named in his honor, as is Folger Park in Washington, D.C. In 1879 and 1880, a company of the New York Army National Guard was organized in Geneva and named the Folger Independent Corps in honor of Folger. The unit became the 34th Independent Company and served during the Spanish–American War as Company B, 3rd New York Infantry Regiment. The unit currently exists as Co. D, 2nd Battalion, 108th Infantry Regiment, based in Ithaca, New York.

<text>The Truce of Andrusovo (, , also sometimes known as Treaty of Andrusovo) established a thirteen-and-a-half year truce, signed on between the Tsardom of Russia and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which had fought the Russo-Polish War since 1654 over the territories of modern-day Ukraine and Belarus.

Afanasy Ordin-Nashchokin (for Russia) and Jerzy Chlebowicz (for the Commonwealth) signed the truce in the village of Andrusovo not far from Smolensk. Representatives of the Cossack Hetmanate were not allowed.

==Terms==
The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Tsardom of Russia agreed on the following terms:

* A truce was signed for 13.5 years during which both states were obligated to prepare the conditions for eternal peace.
* Russia secured the territories of Left-bank Ukraine, Siever lands, and Smolensk.
* Poland-Lithuania was left with Right-bank Ukraine, and Russian-occupied Belarus with Vitebsk, Polotsk, and Dzwinsk.
* The city of Kiev, though situated on the right bank of the Dnieper River, was handed over to Russia for two years under a series of conditions. The transfer, though phrased as temporary, was, in fact, a permanent one cemented in 1686 in exchange for 146,000 rubles.
* The Zaporozhian Sich was recognized as a condominium of both states.
* Both states agreed to provide a common defence against the Ottoman Empire.
* The right of free trade was granted.
* A compensation from Russia to Poland-Lithuania of 1,000,000 złotych or 200,000 rubles was agreed on for the lands of Left-bank Ukraine.

==Consequences==

The transfer of Kiev to the Russian tsardom had far-reaching consequences. Kiev, situated in the Greek-Orthodox part of the Lithuanian Grand Duchy before the Union of Lublin (1569) and in the Polish kingdom thereafter, was the seat of the orthodox metropolitan, who, despite being formally placed under the Roman pope since the Union of Brest (1596), retained authority over the Orthodox population in Poland-Lithuania&#x27;s eastern territories. Prior to Andrusovo, Kiev had been an orthodox counterweight to the Moscow patriarchate, founded in 1589, and since the metropolitanship of Petro Mohyla hosted the Mohyla Academy, that opened orthodoxy to Western influence. The transfer of Kiev to Russia came only days after patriarch Nikon, who reformed the rites within the Muscovite patriarchate, had won the upper hand over his adversary Avvakum, resulting in an intra-Russian schism (&quot;raskol&quot;) between the Reformed Orthodoxy and the Old Believers.

Kiev now supplied the Russian patriarch with an academy (after Mohyla&#x27;s offer to found an academy in Moscow had been rejected) on whose scholars Nikon had relied already for his reforms. Nikon himself, having proposed to replace the Russian &quot;simfonia&quot; (the traditional balance of ecclesiastical and secular power) by a more theocratic model, was banned upon his success, effectively shifting the power balance to the Romanov tsars ruling Russia since the end of the Great Smuta (1613). As the see of the metropolitan, Kiev furthermore granted Moscow influence on the Orthodox population in Poland-Lithuania. &quot;Protection&quot; of the Orthodox population thus became a future argument for Romanov influence over eastern Poland-Lithuania.

==Perspectives==

In Ukraine, the treaty is often viewed as leading to the partition of the Hetmanate state between its more powerful neighboring states.

From the Polish point of view the treaty is considered a significant mistake that tipped the balance of power in the region and replaced Poland as the dominant state by the emerging Russian Empire.

<doc id="751933" wikidata="Q1785085" url="?curid=751933" title="Method of characteristics">
<text>In mathematics, the method of characteristics is a technique for solving partial differential equations. Typically, it applies to first-order equations, though in general characteristic curves can also be found for hyperbolic and parabolic partial differential equation. The method is to reduce a partial differential equation (PDE) to a family of ordinary differential equations (ODE) along which the solution can be integrated from some initial data given on a suitable hypersurface.

==Characteristics of first-order partial differential equation==
For a first-order PDE, the method of characteristics discovers so called characteristic curves along which the PDE becomes an ODE. Once the ODE is found, it can be solved along the characteristic curves and transformed into a solution for the original PDE.

For the sake of simplicity, we confine our attention to the case of a function of two independent variables &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; for the moment. Consider a quasilinear PDE of the form

Suppose that a solution &quot;z&quot; is known, and consider the surface graph &quot;z&quot; = &quot;z&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) in R3. A normal vector to this surface is given by

:formula_1

As a result, equation () is equivalent to the geometrical statement that the vector field

:formula_2

is tangent to the surface &quot;z&quot; = &quot;z&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) at every point, for the dot product of this vector field with the above normal vector is zero. In other words, the graph of the solution must be a union of integral curves of this vector field. These integral curves are called the characteristic curves of the original partial differential equation and follow as the solutions of the characteristic equations:

:formula_3

A parametrization invariant form of the &quot;Lagrange–Charpit equations&quot; is:

:formula_4

===Linear and quasilinear cases===
Consider now a PDE of the form

:formula_5

For this PDE to be linear, the coefficients &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; may be functions of the spatial variables only, and independent of &quot;u&quot;. For it to be quasilinear, &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; may also depend on the value of the function, but not on any derivatives. The distinction between these two cases is inessential for the discussion here.

For a linear or quasilinear PDE, the characteristic curves are given parametrically by

:formula_6
:formula_7

such that the following system of ODEs is satisfied


Equations () and () give the characteristics of the PDE.
In the quasilinear case, the use of the method of characteristics is justified by Grönwall&#x27;s inequality. The above equation may be written as
formula_8

We must distinguish between the solutions to the ODE and the solutions to the PDE, which we do not know are equal &quot;a priori.&quot; Letting capital letters be the solutions to the ODE we find
formula_9
formula_10

Examining formula_11, we find, upon differentiating that
formula_12
which is the same as
formula_13

We cannot conclude the above is 0 as we would like, since the PDE only guarantees us that this relationship is satisfied for
formula_14, formula_15,
and we do not yet know that formula_16.

However, we can see that
formula_17
since by the PDE, the last term is 0. This equals
formula_18

By the triangle inequality, we have
formula_19

Assuming formula_20 are at least formula_21, we can bound this for small times. Choose a neighborhood formula_22 around formula_23 small enough such that formula_20 are locally Lipschitz. By continuity, formula_25 will remain in formula_22 for small enough formula_27. Since formula_28, we also have that formula_29 will be in formula_22 for small enough formula_31 by continuity. So, formula_32 and formula_33 for formula_34. Additionally, formula_35 for some formula_36 for formula_34 by compactness. From this, we find the above is bounded as
formula_38
for some formula_39. It is a straightforward application of Grönwall&#x27;s Inequality to show that since formula_40 we have formula_41 for as long as this inequality holds. We have some interval formula_42 such that formula_43 in this interval. Choose the largest formula_44 such that this is true. Then, by continuity, formula_45. Provided the ODE still has a solution in some interval after formula_44, we can repeat the argument above to find that formula_43 in a larger interval. Thus, so long as the ODE has a solution, we have formula_43.
===Fully nonlinear case===
Consider the partial differential equation

where the variables &quot;p&quot;i are shorthand for the partial derivatives

:formula_49

Let (&quot;x&quot;i(&quot;s&quot;),&quot;u&quot;(&quot;s&quot;),&quot;p&quot;i(&quot;s&quot;)) be a curve in R2n+1. Suppose that &quot;u&quot; is any solution, and that

:formula_50

Along a solution, differentiating () with respect to &quot;s&quot; gives

:formula_51

:formula_52

:formula_53

The second equation follows from applying the chain rule to a solution &quot;u&quot;, and the third follows by taking an exterior derivative of the relation formula_54. Manipulating these equations gives

:formula_55

where λ is a constant. Writing these equations more symmetrically, one obtains the Lagrange–Charpit equations for the characteristic

:formula_56

Geometrically, the method of characteristics in the fully nonlinear case can be interpreted as requiring that the Monge cone of the differential equation should everywhere be tangent to the graph of the solution.

== Example ==
As an example, consider the advection equation (this example assumes familiarity with PDE notation, and solutions to basic ODEs).

:formula_57

where formula_58 is constant and formula_59 is a function of formula_60 and formula_61. We want to transform this linear first-order PDE into an ODE along the appropriate curve; i.e. something of the form

:formula_62

where formula_63 is a characteristic line. First, we find

:formula_64

by the chain rule. Now, if we set formula_65 and formula_66 we get

:formula_67

which is the left hand side of the PDE we started with. Thus

:formula_68

So, along the characteristic line formula_69, the original PDE becomes the ODE formula_70. That is to say that along the characteristics, the solution is constant. Thus, formula_71 where formula_72 and formula_73 lie on the same characteristic. Therefore, to determine the general solution, it is enough to find the characteristics by solving the characteristic system of ODEs:

* formula_66, letting formula_75 we know formula_76,
* formula_77, letting formula_78 we know formula_79,
* formula_80, letting formula_81 we know formula_82.

In this case, the characteristic lines are straight lines with slope formula_58, and the value of formula_59 remains constant along any characteristic line.

== Characteristics of linear differential operators ==
Let &quot;X&quot; be a differentiable manifold and &quot;P&quot; a linear differential operator
:formula_85
of order &quot;k&quot;. In a local coordinate system &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;,
:formula_86
in which &quot;α&quot; denotes a multi-index. The principal symbol of &quot;P&quot;, denoted &quot;σ&quot;&quot;P&quot;, is the function on the cotangent bundle T∗&quot;X&quot; defined in these local coordinates by

:formula_87

where the &quot;ξ&quot;&quot;i&quot; are the fiber coordinates on the cotangent bundle induced by the coordinate differentials &quot;dx&quot;&quot;i&quot;. Although this is defined using a particular coordinate system, the transformation law relating the &quot;ξ&quot;&quot;i&quot; and the &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; ensures that &quot;σ&quot;&quot;P&quot; is a well-defined function on the cotangent bundle.

The function &quot;σ&quot;&quot;P&quot; is homogeneous of degree &quot;k&quot; in the &quot;ξ&quot; variable. The zeros of &quot;σ&quot;&quot;P&quot;, away from the zero section of T∗&quot;X&quot;, are the characteristics of &quot;P&quot;. A hypersurface of &quot;X&quot; defined by the equation &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;c&quot; is called a characteristic hypersurface at &quot;x&quot; if
:formula_88
Invariantly, a characteristic hypersurface is a hypersurface whose conormal bundle is in the characteristic set of &quot;P&quot;.

== Qualitative analysis of characteristics ==
Characteristics are also a powerful tool for gaining qualitative insight into a PDE.

One can use the crossings of the characteristics to find shock waves for potential flow in a compressible fluid. Intuitively, we can think of each characteristic line implying a solution to formula_59 along itself. Thus, when two characteristics cross, the function becomes multi-valued resulting in a non-physical solution. Physically, this contradiction is removed by the formation of a shock wave, a tangential discontinuity or a weak discontinuity and can result in non-potential flow, violating the initial assumptions.

Characteristics may fail to cover part of the domain of the PDE. This is called a rarefaction, and indicates the solution typically exists only in a weak, i.e. integral equation, sense.

The direction of the characteristic lines indicates the flow of values through the solution, as the example above demonstrates. This kind of knowledge is useful when solving PDEs numerically as it can indicate which finite difference scheme is best for the problem.

<text>USS &quot;Moccasin&quot; (SS-5) (later renamed A-4) was one of seven s built for the United States Navy (USN) in the first decade of the 20th century.

==Description==
The &quot;Plunger&quot;-class submarines were enlarged and improved versions of the preceding , the first submarine in the USN. They had a length of overall, a beam of and a mean draft of . They displaced on the surface and submerged. The &quot;Plunger&quot;-class boats had a crew of one officer and six enlisted men. They had a diving depth of .

For surface running, they were powered by one gasoline engine that drove the single propeller shaft. When submerged the propeller was driven by a electric motor. The boats could reach on the surface and underwater.

The &quot;Plunger&quot;-class boats were armed with one 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tube in the bow. They carried two reloads, for a total of three torpedoes.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Moccasin&quot; was laid down under the direction of Arthur Leopold Busch on 8 November 1900 in Elizabeth, New Jersey at the Crescent Shipyard, launched on 20 August 1901, and commissioned on 17 January 1903 at the Holland Torpedo Boat Station at New Suffolk, N.Y. Assigned to duty at the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, &quot;Moccasin&quot; operated locally on principally training and experimental activities until assigned to the Reserve Torpedo Flotilla at Norfolk on 15 June 1904, in which unit she remained inactive for the next half decade. The submarine ran aground in North Carolina&#x27;s outer banks in late 1903, and was several miles away from the Wright Brothers&#x27; inaugural flight on 17 December 1903. 1904 On 20 July 1909, the submarine torpedo boat was loaded onto the collier , which sailed soon thereafter for the Philippines. &quot;Moccasin&quot;″s sister-ship, , was on board as deck cargo as well, lashed to the auxiliary&#x27;s forward well deck. Arriving at Olongapo on 1 October, &quot;Moccasin&quot; was launched on 7 October. Recommissioned on 10 February 1910, she was assigned to the First Submarine Division, Asiatic Torpedo Fleet, based in the Manila area.
==A new name==
&quot;Moccasin&quot; was renamed &quot;A-4&quot; on 17 November 1911. During World War I, like her sister-ships, she patrolled the entrance to Manila Bay and convoyed ships moving out of local waters. Later placed in reserve, &quot;A-4&quot; was decommissioned at Cavite on 12 December 1919. She was sunk as a target ship afterwards.

<text>Xserve RAID is a attachment mass-storage server that was offered by Apple Inc.

Xserve RAID held up to 14 hot-swappable Ultra-ATA hard drives, and had a capacity of 10.5 TB when filled with 750 GB modules. Xserve RAID supported RAID levels of 0, 0+1, 1, 3 and 5 in hardware, hybrid RAID levels such as 10 and 50 could be created in software. It was rack-mountable and was 3U high.

Although the Xserve RAID contained 14 drives, they were split into two independent groups of 7 drives each managed by an identical RAID controller. Importantly, the controllers were independent, but not redundant; each managed seven of the storage array&#x27;s fourteen drives, given a failure of one of the controllers those 7 drives were not accessible: the other could not take over its duties. Xserve RAID did, however, have redundant cooling units and power supplies. Xserve RAID&#x27;s ports were two Fibre Channel ports for regular data transfer, a 10/100 Ethernet port for remote management, and a serial port for UPS communication via the Simple Signaling Protocol.

Apple marketed Xserve RAID mainly as a companion to Xserve in file server and high-performance technical computing applications. The storage array is also useful in some environments such as non-linear video editing. Also, Apple certified Xserve RAID for use with some other vendors&#x27; servers, such as those running Windows Server 2003 or Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Due to the cross-platform support available, users do not need a Mac to administer the Xserve RAID. Apple shipped a CD-ROM with the device containing the Xserve RAID Admin Tools, a Java software application that runs on most operating systems — including OS X, Windows, Linux, and Solaris.

Xserve RAID was available in models costing between US$5,999 and US$10,999 (later US$12,999), plus configuration and support options.

The Xserve RAID was discontinued on February 19, 2008.

<text>is a gate in the Shuri neighborhood of Naha, the capital of Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. It was the second of Shuri Castle&#x27;s main gates. Now it is the main gate to the castle complex. Chūzanmon was the first ceremonial gate to Shurijo, built around 1427 by King Shō Hashi, and it was demolished in 1907.

==Construction==
It was first built in the 16th century, and the structure of the gate is similar to that of Chinese three-bay turret gates, and is covered with a red tiled hip roof. The four Hanzi framed on the gate - &quot;Shu&quot;, &quot;rei&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, and &quot;kuni&quot;, which mean &#x27;Land of Propriety&#x27;, were added to the gate long after it was built. It was also called and in Okinawan. The gate reflects strong Chinese influence, alongside indigenous religious traditions.

==Reconstruction==
The gate was destroyed in 1945 during the Battle of Okinawa and reconstructed through local campaigns and support in the 1950s and 1960s. It became the first part of the Shuri Castle to be reconstructed, while decades would follow until the rest of the castle was restored. The main columns are 7.94 meters apart. The top layer of the gate is 7.05 meters high, and the lower layer 5.11 meters. The four pillars stand on foundation stones, and they are supported on front and back by slanting accessory pillars for better stability. A picture of the reconstructed gate appears on the 2000 yen note issued in 2000 to commemorate the 26th G8 summit held in Okinawa.

<doc id="751960" wikidata="Q1457686" url="?curid=751960" title="List of United States Navy amphibious warfare ships">
<text>This is a list of United States Navy amphibious warfare ships. This type of ship has been in use with the US Navy since World War I. 

Ship status is indicated as either currently active [A] (including ready reserve), inactive [I], or precommissioning [P]. Ships in the inactive category include only ships in the inactive reserve, ships which have been disposed from US service have no listed status. Ships in the precommissioning category include ships under construction or on order.

==Historical overview==
There have been four generations of amphibious warfare ships, with each generation having more capability than the previous:
* The first generation simply landed troops and equipment ashore with standard (i.e., non-specialized) boats and barges. These ships are not listed in this article since they were indistinguishable from the troopships and other surface combatants of their day, and as such were not assigned specialized hull classification symbols.
* The second generation was designed during World War II to land personnel and vehicles ashore, either directly or via carried specialized landing craft.
* The third generation was designed beginning in the 1950s to use helicopters for amphibious operations, with the result that such operations were no longer limited to beaches.
* The fourth generation was designed beginning in the 1980s to use hovercraft (Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) specifically), with the result that the numbers and types of beaches which could be accessed dramatically increased.

===World War II===

During the naval build-up for World War II, almost 200 Maritime Commission (MARCOM) standard designs were converted to US Navy amphibious warfare ships. In the Cold War these and newer standard designs were built under MARCOM&#x27;s successor agency, the United States Maritime Administration (MARAD): 
* 1 Type C1 ship: 1 AKA
* 101 Type C2 ships: 15 AGC, 79 AKA, 7 APA
* 16 Type C3 ships: 15 APA, 1 AKA
* 3 Type C4 ships: 1 AKA, 2 APA
* 64 Type S4 ships: 32 AKA, 32 APA
* 117 Type VC2 Victory ships: all AKA
In the following lists MARCOM types are abbreviated as &#x27;MC type&#x27; and MARAD as &#x27;MA type&#x27;; &#x27;MC types&#x27; became &#x27;MA types&#x27; in 1950.

===Postwar===
The first amphibious warfare ships had a top speed of 12 to 17 knots. With the appearance of higher speed submarines at the end of World War II, the US Navy decided that all new amphibious warfare ships would have to have a minimum speed of to increase their chances of survival. The High Speed Transport destroyer conversions (APD/LPR), the Landing Platform Docks (LPD), and all new ships with a full flight deck (LPH, LHA, LHD) would meet this criterion. The other major types would see relatively small numbers of new ships constructed with this 20 knot requirement, with the last appearing in 1969.

===Classifications===
Amphibious warfare ships were considered by the US Navy to be auxiliaries and were classed with hull classification symbols beginning with &#x27;A&#x27; until 1942. Many ships were reclassed at that time as landing ships and received new hull symbols beginning with &#x27;L&#x27;; others would retain &#x27;A&#x27; hull symbols until 1969 and then receive &#x27;L&#x27; symbols. This article pairs the two lists of what are the same ships, with each &#x27;L&#x27; list preceding the respective &#x27;A&#x27; list. Littoral Combat Ships also use &#x27;L&#x27; hull symbols but are not solely intended for amphibious warfare.

In 2015 the US Navy created new hull classification symbols that began with an &#x27;E&#x27; to designate &#x27;expeditionary&#x27; vessels. Expeditionary vessels are designed to support low-intensity missions, allowing more expensive, high-value amphibious warfare ships to be re-tasked for more demanding missions. Most of these ships are not commissioned warships, but rather are operated by the Military Sealift Command.

==Amphibious assault ship (General Purpose) (LHA)==


:The &quot;Tarawa&quot;-class LHA was the first to combine the features of the well deck of the Landing Ship Dock (LSD) or Landing Platform Dock (LPD) and the full flight deck of the Landing Platform Helicopter (LPH) into one ship. Though not designed to carry Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC)s, they could accommodate one in their well decks.

* USS &quot;Peleliu&quot; (LHA-5) [I]

:The &quot;America&quot;-class LHA would be a follow-on to the &quot;Wasp&quot;-class LHD. The first two ships, &quot;America&quot; and &quot;Tripoli&quot;, would not have a well deck, so as to dedicate more space to the support of air operations. This was criticized as a repeat of the mistakes of the LPH concept, and so it was decided that &quot;Bougainville&quot; and all future ships of this class would have a well deck.

==Amphibious assault ship (multi-purpose) (LHD)==

:The well deck of the &quot;Tarawa&quot;-class LHA was not designed to accommodate the LCAC, which came into service just six years after the last of that class was completed. The &quot;Wasp&quot;-class LHD and the later units of the &quot;America&quot;-class LHA were designed to be LCAC compatible; the &quot;Wasp&quot;-class could carry 3 LCACs.

==Landing Platform Helicopter (LPH)==

The Landing Platform Helicopter (LPH) would be the first ships to operate helicopters for large scale air assault behind beaches. One major defect of the LPH concept was that these ships did not carry landing craft to disembark Marines when weather or hostile anti-aircraft systems grounded helicopters; only &quot;Inchon&quot; would be modified to carry &quot;two&quot; landing craft. In such situations the LPH would be reliant on landing craft supplied by other ships, which proved awkward in practice. This defect would drive the design of the &quot;Tarawa&quot;-class LHA, in effect a LPH with a well deck.

:As the &#x27;definitive&#x27; LPH design under project SCB 157, the &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; class would be the only class to be built as such, with sufficient &#x27;hotel&#x27; accommodations for the embarked Marines. All other LPH ships would be conversions of aircraft carriers, and so had accommodation deficiencies (for example, some Marine units could not bunk together, and water evaporation was insufficient to allow all personnel showers within a 24 hour period).

:After their retirement as amphibious warfare ships, one (&quot;Inchon&quot;) would be converted to carry minesweeping helicopters as a mine countermeasures support ship (MCS). All of these ships would be scrapped or sunk as targets by 2018.

==Landing Platform Dock (LPD)==



The Landing Platform Dock (LPD) concept began as a compromise design, an attempt to build a ship with much more capability than a Landing Ship Dock (LSD) - the LPD superficially resembles an LSD with an enlarged flight deck - but without the expense of a LPH. The well deck is smaller than that of an LSD. The &quot;Raleigh&quot; and &quot;Austin&quot; classes could be fitted with a temporary telescoping helicopter hangar.

Several of these ships were built with space dedicated for command capabilities. Two of these, &quot;La Salle&quot; and &quot;Coronado&quot;, would be redesignated as auxiliary command ships (AGF).

The &quot;Raleigh&quot; class would be designed under project SBC 187 (&quot;La Salle&quot; under SBC 187A) and the &quot;Austin&quot; class under SBC 187B.

==Landing Ship Dock (LSD)==


The LSD came as a result of a British requirement during World War II for a vessel that could carry large landing craft across the seas at speed. The design was developed and built in the US for the Royal Navy and the US Navy, with the US Navy originally classifying these ships as Mechanized artillery transports (APM), then changing them to LSDs. The first LSDs could carry 36 Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM) at in a flooding well deck, the first ships with this capability. Late in the war they were modified with the addition of a temporary superdeck over the well deck; this could carry vehicles, support helicopter operations, or be removed for outsized cargo. 

In December 2020 the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Report to Congress on the Annual Long-Range Plan for Construction of Naval Vessels stated that it was planned that all LSDs would be placed Out of Commission in Reserve by 2027.

:The &quot;Blue Ridge&quot;-class would be the only amphibious command ships purposely built as such by the US Navy, and the first and only class capable of exceeding 20 knots. Their hulls were based on the &quot;Iwo Jima&quot;-class Landing Platform Helicopter (LPH) design due to the need for flat deck space for multiple antennas. After the retirement of the fleet flagships [cruisers] (see also ) these ships would be pressed into that role despite their lack of speed relative to carrier strike groups.

==Landing craft, control (LCC)==
Not to be confused with the later Amphibious command ship (LCC).

During World War II a number of small boats were built to direct the movements of landing craft as they approached beaches. These were 56 feet in length, displaced 30 tons, and ran 13-16 knots in speed. They were equipped with multiple radios and SO radar (the same radar as on PT boats). During the invasion of southern France they were used to control drone minesweepers.

==Landing craft infantry (LCI)==
The United States Navy built 932 Landing Craft Infantry ships in World War II.
==Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM)==
The United States Navy built 11,144 landing craft Motorized, designated &quot;Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM)&quot; in World War II.

==Landing craft tank (LCT)==
The United States Navy built 1,394 landing craft tank, designated &quot;Landing Craft Tank (LCT)&quot; in World War II. Those that were still in use in 1949 were redesignated as Landing Craft, Utility.
==Landing craft utility (LCU)==
The United States Navy built the LCU 1466, 1610 and 1627 classes after World War II. Seventy old LCUs (likely ex-LCTs) were retired from amphibious duties and reclassified as Harbor utility craft (YFU).
==Landing ship medium (LSM)==
Towards the end of World War II the United States Navy built 558 Landing Ship Medium (LSM) type vessels across three classes. They were originally designed under the classification Landing Craft Tank - Mark 7 but were reclassified after exceeding 200 feet in length.
As of February 2023 the US Marine Corps has proposed the purchase of 18 to 35 modern LSMs; this LSM concept was previously known as the Light Amphibious Warship (LAW).

==Landing ship, tank (LST)==
The United States Navy built nearly 1,200 tank landing ships, classified as &quot;Landing Ship, Tank&quot; or &quot;LST&quot;, from the World War II-era up through the early 1970s. The &quot;Newport&quot; class, which entered service in 1969, would be the last class built and the only class capable of exceeding 20 knots. The 1987 introduction of Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) — which allowed for over-the-horizon amphibious landings onto a far larger number of beaches — made LSTs obsolete, but they remained with the fleet for another decade because they were the only means by which the hundreds of thousands of gallons of motor vehicle fuel needed by a Marine Expeditionary Force could be landed. Only the development of tankers with the Offshore Petroleum Discharge System (OPDS) and the later development of special fuel bladders which gave the LCACs a tanker capability allowed for their retirement.
===Landing ship, tank, hospital (LSTH)===
==Atlantic tank landing ship (ATL)==
The ATL hull classification was short-lived; it was changed to Landing Ship Tank (LST).
* USS &quot;ATL-1&quot;, later USS &quot;LST-1&quot;

==Vehicle landing ship (LSV)==
The World War II LSVs were converted from surplus minelayers (CM) and netlayers (AN) into ships which could carry and launch amphibious vehicles. After the war most were slated to become mine countermeasures support ships (MCS), but only two were actually converted.
* , former CM-6, AP-106, later MCS-1
* , former CM-7, AP-107, later MCS-2
* , former AN-3, AP-108, later MCS-3 canceled
* , former AN-4, AP-109, later MCS-4 canceled
* , former AN-1, AP-160, later MCS-5 canceled
* , former AN-2, AP-161, later AKN-6

The post-WW2 LSVs were among the first roll-on/roll-off cargo ships.

* , former T-AK-269, later T-AKR-7
* , former LSD-23, T-AK-273
* , later T-AKR-9

==Patrol craft, control (PCC)==

Thirty-five s were converted into amphibious landing control vessel during World War II and reclassified as Patrol Craft, Control after the war. Extra personnel (eight radiomen, two signalmen, one quartermaster and two communications officers), accommodations and improved radar and communications equipment were added. PCs proved exceptionally adept as Control Vessels, guiding waves of landing craft during numerous amphibious landings in the European and Pacific Theaters.

<text>General Walter Bedell &quot;Beetle&quot; Smith (5 October 1895 – 9 August 1961) was a senior officer of the United States Army who served as General Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s chief of staff at Allied Forces Headquarters (AFHQ) during the Tunisia Campaign and the Allied invasion of Italy in 1943, during World War II. He was Eisenhower&#x27;s chief of staff at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) in the campaign in Western Europe from 1944 to 1945.

Smith enlisted as a private in the Indiana Army National Guard in 1911. During World War I, he served with the American Expeditionary Forces and was commissioned to second lieutenant in 1917. He was wounded in the Aisne-Marne Offensive in 1918. After the war, he was a staff officer and instructor at the U.S. Army Infantry School. In 1941, he became secretary of the General Staff, and in 1942 he became the secretary to the Combined Chiefs of Staff. His duties involved taking part in discussions of war plans at the highest level, and Smith often briefed President Franklin D. Roosevelt on strategic matters.

Smith became chief of staff to Eisenhower at AFHQ in September 1942 and acquired a reputation as Eisenhower&#x27;s &quot;hatchet man&quot; for his brusque and demanding manner. However, he also successfully represented Eisenhower in sensitive missions requiring diplomatic skill. Smith was involved in negotiating the armistice between Italy and the Allies, which he signed on behalf of Eisenhower. In 1944, he became the chief of staff of SHAEF, again under Eisenhower. In that position, Smith also negotiated successfully for food and fuel aid to be sent through German lines for the cold and starving Dutch civilian population, and he opened discussions for the peaceful and complete German capitulation to the First Canadian Army in the Netherlands. In May 1945, Smith met representatives of the German High Command in Reims, France, to conduct the surrender of the German Armed Forces, and he signed the German Instrument of Surrender on behalf of Eisenhower.

After the war, he served as the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1946 to 1948. In 1950, Smith became the Director of Central Intelligence, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the other intelligence agencies in the United States. Smith reorganized the CIA, redefined its structure and its mission, and gave it a new sense of purpose. He made the CIA the arm of government that is primarily responsible for covert operations. He left the CIA in 1953 to become Under Secretary of State. After retiring from the State Department in 1954, Smith continued to serve the Eisenhower administration in various posts for several years until he retired shortly before he died in 1961.

==Early life==
Walter Bedell Smith was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, on 5 October 1895, the elder of two sons of William Long Smith, a silk buyer for the Pettis Dry Goods Company, and his wife, Ida Francis née Bedell, who worked for the same company.

Smith was called Bedell from his boyhood. From an early age he was nicknamed &quot;Beetle&quot; or occasionally &quot;Beedle&quot; or &quot;Boodle.&quot; He was educated at St. Peter and Paul School, Public Schools #10 and #29, Oliver Perry Morton School, and Emmerich Manual High School, where he studied to be a machinist. There, he took a job at the National Motor Vehicle Company and eventually left high school without graduating. Smith enrolled at Butler University, but his father developed serious health problems, and Smith left to return to his job and support his family.

In 1911, at the age of 16, Smith enlisted as a private in Company D of the 2nd Indiana Infantry of the Indiana National Guard. The Indiana National Guard was called out twice in 1913 for the Ohio River flood and during the Indianapolis streetcar strike. Smith was promoted to corporal and then sergeant. During the Pancho Villa Expedition he served on the staff of the Indiana National Guard.

In 1913, Smith met Mary Eleanor (Nory) Cline, who was born in 1893 and died in 1963, and they were married in a traditional Roman Catholic wedding ceremony on 1 July 1917. Their marriage was of long duration but was childless.

==World War I==
Smith&#x27;s work during the Ohio River flood of 1913 led to his nomination for officer training in 1917, and he was sent to the Officer Candidate Training Camp at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indiana for officer indoctrination. Upon his graduation on 27 November 1917, he was directly commissioned as a second lieutenant. He was then assigned to the newly formed Company A, 1st Battalion, 39th Infantry, part of the 4th Infantry Division at Camp Greene, North Carolina. The 4th Infantry Division embarked for Europe, which was embroiled in World War I, from Hoboken, New Jersey, on 9 May 1918, and reached Brest, France, on 23 May. After training with the British and French Armies, the 4th Division entered the front lines in June 1918 and joined the Aisne-Marne Offensive on 18 July 1918. Smith was wounded by shell fragments during an attack two days later.

Because of his wounds, Smith was returned to the United States. He served with the U.S. Department of War&#x27;s General Staff and was assigned to the Military Intelligence Division. In September 1918, he was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the Regular Army.

Smith was next sent to the newly formed 379th Infantry Regiment as its intelligence officer. The regiment was part of the 95th Infantry Division, based at Camp Sherman, Ohio. The 95th Infantry Division was demobilized following the signing of the Armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918.

In February 1919, Smith was assigned to Camp Dodge, Iowa, where he was involved with the disposal of surplus equipment and supplies. In March 1919, he was transferred to the 2nd Infantry Regiment, a regular unit based at Camp Dodge, remaining there until November 1919, when it moved to Camp Sherman.

==Between the wars==
In 1921, the staff of the 2nd Infantry moved to Fort Sheridan, Illinois. In 1922, Smith became aide de camp to Brigadier General George Van Horn Moseley, the commander of the 12th Infantry Brigade at Fort Sheridan. From 1925 to 1929 Smith worked as an assistant in the Bureau of the Budget. He then served a two-year tour of duty overseas on the staff of the 45th Infantry at Fort William McKinley in the Philippines. After nine years as a first lieutenant, he was promoted to captain in September 1929.

Returning to the United States, Smith reported to the U.S. Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia, in March 1931. Upon graduation in June 1932, he stayed on as an instructor in the Weapons Section in which he was responsible for demonstrating weapons like the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle. In 1933, he was sent to the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He later returned to the Infantry School but was detached again to attend the U.S. Army War College from which he graduated in 1937.

He returned to the Infantry School once more and he was promoted to major on 1 January 1939 after nine years as a captain. The slow promotion was common in the Army in the 1920s and the 1930s. Officers like Smith, commissioned between November 1916 and November 1918, made up 55.6% of the Army&#x27;s officer corps in 1926. Promotions were usually based on seniority, and the modest objective of promoting officers to major after 17 years of service could not be met because of a shortage of posts for them to fill.

==World War II==
===Washington, D.C.===
When General George C. Marshall became the Army&#x27;s Chief of Staff in September 1939, he brought Smith to Washington, D.C., to be the assistant to the secretary of the General Staff. The Secretary of the General Staff was primarily concerned with records, paperwork, and the collection of statistics, but he also performed a great deal of analysis, liaison, and administration. One of Smith&#x27;s duties was liaison with Major General Edwin &quot;Pa&quot; Watson, the senior military aide to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Smith was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 4 May 1941, and then to colonel on 30 August 1941. On 1 September, the Secretary of the General Staff, Colonel Orlando Ward, was given command of the 1st Armored Division, and Smith became secretary of the General Staff.

The Arcadia Conference, which was held in Washington, D.C., December 1941 and January 1942, mandated the creation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as a counterpart to the British Chiefs of Staff Committee, and Smith was named as its secretary on 23 January 1942. The same conference also brought about the creation of the Combined Chiefs of Staff, which consisted of the (American) Joint Chiefs of Staff and the (British) Chiefs of Staff Committee meeting as a single body. Brigadier Vivian Dykes of the British Joint Staff Mission provided the secretarial arrangements for the new organization at first, but Marshall thought that an American secretariat was required.

He appointed Smith as the secretary of the Combined Chiefs of Staff and of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Since Dykes was senior in service time to Smith, and Marshall wanted Smith to be in charge, Smith was promoted to brigadier general on 2 February 1942. He assumed the new post a week later, with Dykes as his deputy. The two men worked in partnership to create and organize the secretariat and to build the organization of the Combined Chiefs-of-Staff into one which could co-ordinate the war efforts of both allies, along with the Canadians, Australians, French and others.

Smith&#x27;s duties involved taking part in discussions of strategy at the highest level, and he often briefed Roosevelt on strategic matters. However Smith became frustrated as he watched other officers receive operational commands that he desired. He later remarked: &quot;That year I spent working as secretary of the general staff for George Marshall was one of the most rewarding of my entire career, and the unhappiest year of my life.&quot;

===North African Theater===

When Major General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed as the commander of the European Theater of Operations in June 1942, he requested that Smith be sent from Washington as his chief of staff. Smith&#x27;s record as a staff officer and his proven ability to work harmoniously with the British made him a natural choice for the post. Reluctantly, Marshall acceded to the request, and Smith took over as the chief of staff at Allied Forces Headquarters (AFHQ) on 15 September 1942. Reporting to him were two deputy chiefs of staff, Brigadier General Alfred Gruenther and Brigadier John Whiteley, and also the chief administrative officer (CAO), Major General Humfrey Gale.

AFHQ was a balanced binational organization in which the chief of each section was paired with a deputy of the other nationality. Its structure was generally American but with some British aspects. For example, Gale as CAO controlled both personnel and supply functions, which under the American system would have reported directly to Smith. Initially, AFHQ was located in London, but it moved to Algiers in November and December 1942, with Smith arriving on 11 December. Although AFHQ had an authorized strength of only 700, Smith aggressively expanded it. By January 1943 its American component alone was 1,406 and its strength eventually topped 4,000 men and women. As the chief-of-staff, Smith zealously guarded access to Eisenhower, acquired a reputation as a tough and brusque manager, and was often referred to as Eisenhower&#x27;s &quot;hatchet man.&quot;

Pending the organization of the North African Theater of Operations, U.S. Army (NATOUSA), Smith also acted as its chief of staff until 15 February, when Brigadier General Everett S. Hughes became the Deputy Theater commander and the commanding general of the Communications Zone. The relationship between Smith and Hughes, an old friend of Eisenhower, was tense. Smith later accused Hughes of &quot;empire building,&quot; and the two clashed over trivial issues. In Algiers, Smith and Eisenhower seldom socialized together. Smith conducted formal dinners at his villa, an estate surrounded by gardens and terraces, with two large drawing rooms decorated with mosaics, oriental rugs, and art treasures. Like Eisenhower, Smith had a female companion, a nurse, Captain Ethel Westerman.

After the disastrous Battle of the Kasserine Pass, Eisenhower sent Smith forward to report on the state of affairs at the American II Corps. Smith recommended the relief of its commander, Major General Lloyd Fredendall, as did General Harold Alexander and Major Generals Omar Bradley and Lucian Truscott. On their advice, Eisenhower replaced Fredendall with Major General George S. Patton Jr. Eisenhower also relieved his Assistant Chief of Staff Intelligence (G-2), Brigadier Eric Mockler-Ferryman, pinpointing faulty intelligence at AFHQ as a contributing factor in the defeat at Kasserine. Mockler-Ferryman was replaced by Brigadier Kenneth Strong.

The debacle at Kasserine Pass strained relations between the Allies, and another crisis developed when II Corps reported that enemy aviation operated at will over its sector because of an absence of Allied air cover. That elicited a scathing response from British Air Marshal Arthur Coningham on the competence of American troops. Eisenhower drafted a letter to Marshall suggesting that Coningham should be relieved of his command since he could not control the acrimony between senior Allied commanders, but Smith persuaded him not to send it. Instead, Air Chief Marshal Arthur Tedder, Major General Carl Spaatz, and Brigadier General Laurence S. Kuter paid Patton a visit at his headquarters. Their meeting was interrupted by a German air raid, which convinced the airmen that Patton had a point. Coningham withdrew his written criticisms and apologized.

For the Allied invasion of Sicily, the Combined Chiefs of Staff designated Eisenhower as the overall commander but ordered the three component commanders, Alexander, Tedder, and Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham of the Royal Navy, to &quot;cooperate&quot;. To Eisenhower, that command arrangement meant a reversion to the old British &quot;committee system&quot;. He drafted a cable to the Combined Chiefs of Staff demanding a unified command structure, but Smith persuaded him to tear it up.

Disagreements arose between Allied commanders over the operational plan, which called for a series of dispersed landings based on the desire of the air, naval, and logistical planners concerning the early capture of ports and airfields. General Bernard Montgomery, the commander of the British Eighth Army, objected to that aspect of the plan since it exposed the Allied forces to defeat in detail. Montgomery put forward an alternate plan that involved American and British forces landing side by side. He convinced Smith that his alternate plan was sound, and the two men persuaded most of the other Allied commanders. Montgomery&#x27;s plan provided for the early seizure of airfields, which satisfied Tedder and Cunningham. The fears of logisticians like Major General Thomas B. Larkin that supply would not be practical without a port were resolved by the use of amphibious trucks.

In August 1943, Smith and Strong flew to Lisbon via Gibraltar in civilian clothes and met with &quot;Generale di Brigata&quot; Giuseppe Castellano at the British embassy. Castellano had hoped to arrange terms for Italy to join the United Nations against Nazi Germany, Smith was empowered to draw up an armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces but was unable to negotiate political matters. On 3 September, Smith and Castellano signed the agreed-upon text on behalf of Eisenhower and Pietro Badoglio, respectively, in a simple ceremony beneath an olive tree at Cassibile, Sicily. In October, Smith traveled to Washington for two weeks to represent Eisenhower in a series of meetings, including one with Roosevelt at Hyde Park, New York, on 10 October.

===European theater===
In December 1943, Eisenhower was appointed Supreme Allied Commander for Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy. Eisenhower wished to take Smith and other key members of his AFHQ staff with him to his new assignment, but British Prime Minister Winston Churchill wanted to retain Smith at AFHQ as Deputy Supreme Commander in the Mediterranean. Churchill reluctantly gave way at Eisenhower&#x27;s insistence. On New Year&#x27;s Eve, Smith met with General (one day later Field Marshal) Sir Alan Brooke to discuss the transfer of key British staff members from AFHQ to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF). Brooke released Gale only after a strong appeal from Smith but refused to transfer Strong. A heated exchange resulted, and Brooke later complained to Eisenhower about Smith&#x27;s behavior. That was the only time that a senior British officer ever complained openly about Smith. Whiteley became Chief of Intelligence (G-2) at SHAEF instead of Strong, but Eisenhower and Smith had their way in the long run, and Strong assumed the post on 25 May 1944, with Brigadier General Thomas J. Betts as his deputy.
Smith was promoted to lieutenant general and made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in January 1944. On 18 January, he set out for London with two-and-a-half tons of personal baggage loaded onto a pair of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses. The staff of the chief-of-staff to the Supreme Allied Commander (COSSAC) was already active, and he had been planning Operation Overlord since April 1943.

This staff was absorbed into SHAEF, with COSSAC, with Major General Frederick Morgan, becoming Smith&#x27;s deputy chief of staff at SHAEF. Gale also held the title of deputy chief of staff, as well as being chief administrative officer, and there was also a deputy chief of staff (Air), Air Vice Marshal James Robb. The heads of the other staff divisions were Major General Ray W. Barker (G-1), Major General Harold R. Bull (G-3), Major General Robert W. Crawford (G-4) and Major General Sir Roger Lumley (G-5).

Morgan had located his COSSAC headquarters in Norfolk House at 31 St. James&#x27;s Square, London, but Smith moved it to Bushy Park, in the outskirts of London in accord with Eisenhower&#x27;s expressed desire not to have his headquarters in a major city. A hutted camp was built with of floor space. By the time Operation Overlord began, accommodations had been provided for 750 officers and 6,000 enlisted men and women.

Eisenhower and Smith&#x27;s offices were in a subterranean complex. Smith&#x27;s office was spartan, dominated by a large portrait of Marshall. An advanced command post codenamed Sharpener was established near Portsmouth, where Montgomery&#x27;s 21st Army Group and Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay&#x27;s Allied Naval Expeditionary Force headquarters were located.

Ground operations in Normandy were controlled by Montgomery at first, but the SHAEF Forward headquarters moved to Jullouville in August, and on 1 September Eisenhower assumed control of Bradley&#x27;s 12th Army Group and Montgomery&#x27;s 21st Army Group. Smith soon realized that he had made a mistake. The forward headquarters was remote and inaccessible and lacked the necessary communications equipment.

On 6 September, Eisenhower ordered both SHAEF Forward and SHAEF Main to move to Versailles as soon as possible. SHAEF Forward began its move on 15 September and it opened in Versailles on 20 September. SHAEF Main followed, moving from Bushy Park by air. The move was completed by October, and SHAEF remained there until 17 February 1945, when SHAEF Forward moved to Reims. By this time, SHAEF had grown in size to 16,000 officers and enlisted men, of whom 10,000 were American and 6,000 British.

By November 1944, Strong was reporting that there was a possibility of a German counteroffensive in the Ardennes or the Vosges. Smith sent Strong to personally warn Bradley, who was preparing an offensive of his own. The magnitude and ferocity of the German Ardennes Offensive came as a shock, and Smith had to defend Strong against criticism for failing to sound the alarm. He felt that Bradley had been given ample warning.

Once battle was joined, Eisenhower acted decisively by committing the two armored divisions in the 12th Army Group&#x27;s reserve over Bradley&#x27;s objection, along with his own meager reserves, two airborne divisions. Whiteley and Betts visited the U.S. First Army headquarters and were unimpressed with how its commanders were handling the situation. Strong, Whiteley, and Betts recommended that command of the armies north of the Ardennes be transferred from Bradley to Montgomery.

Smith&#x27;s immediate reaction was to dismiss the suggestion out of hand. He told Strong and Whiteley that they were fired and should pack their bags and return to the United Kingdom. On the next morning, Smith apologized, had had second thoughts, and informed them that he would present their recommendation to Eisenhower as his own. He realized the military and political implications and knew that such a recommendation had to come from an American officer. On 20 December, he recommended it to Eisenhower, who telephoned both Bradley and Montgomery, and Eisenhower ordered it.

This decision was greatly resented by many Americans, particularly in 12th Army Group, who felt that the action discredited the U.S. Army&#x27;s command structure. Heavy casualties since the start of Operation Overlord had resulted in a critical shortage of infantry replacements even before the crisis situation created by the Ardennes Offensive. Steps were taken to divert men from Communications Zone units. The commander of the Communication Zone, Lieutenant General John C. H. Lee, persuaded Eisenhower to allow soldiers to volunteer for service &quot;without regard to color or race to the units where assistance is most needed, and give you the opportunity of fighting shoulder to shoulder to bring about victory.&quot;

Smith immediately grasped the political implications and put his position to Eisenhower in writing:

The policy was revised, with colored soldiers serving in provisional platoons. In the 12th Army Group these were attached to regiments, while in the 6th Army Group the platoons were grouped into whole companies attached to the division. The former arrangement were generally better rated by the units they were attached to, because the colored platoons had no company-level unit training.

During the liberation of Paris, the Allied High Command put pressure on the Free French Forces leading the march to be all white, which was made difficult as the vast majority of units were over two-thirds African. Smith wrote a confidential memo that stated that it was &quot;more desirable that the division mentioned above consist of white personnel&quot; to match US segregated platoons.

On 15 April 1945, the Nazi governor (&quot;Reichskommissar&quot;) of the Netherlands, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, offered to open up Amsterdam to food and coal shipments to ease the suffering of the civilian population. Smith and Strong, representing SHAEF, along with Major General Ivan Susloparov representing the Soviet Union, Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld representing the Dutch government, and Major General Sir Francis de Guingand from 21st Army Group, met with Seyss-Inquart in the Dutch village of Achterveld on 30 April. After threatening Seyss-Inquart with prosecution for war crimes, Smith successfully negotiated for the provision of food to the suffering Dutch civilian population in the cities in the west of the country and opened discussions for the peaceful and complete German capitulation in the Netherlands to the First Canadian Army, which occurred on 5 May.

Smith had to conduct another set of surrender negotiations, that of the German armed forces, in May 1945. Smith met with the representatives of the German High Command (the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot;), Colonel General Alfred Jodl and General-Admiral Hans-Georg von Friedeburg. Once again, Strong acted as an interpreter. Smith took a hard line by threatening that unless terms were accepted, the Allies would seal the front, which would force the remaining Germans into the hands of the Red Army, but he made some concessions on a ceasefire before the surrender came into effect. On 7 May, Smith cosigned the surrender document along with Soviet General Susloparov, both of whom represented the Allies, and Jodl, who represented Germany. The French representative, Major General François Sevez, signed as a witness.

==Postwar==
===Ambassador to the Soviet Union===
Smith briefly returned to the United States in late June 1945, after spending several days resting at the 108th General Hospital in Clichy, France. In August, Eisenhower nominated Smith as his successor as commander of U.S. Forces, European Theater, as ETOUSA was redesignated on 1 July 1945. Smith was passed over in favor of General Joseph McNarney. When Eisenhower took over as Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army in November 1945, he summoned Smith to become his assistant chief of staff for operations and planning. However, soon after his arrival back in Washington he was asked by President Harry S. Truman and U.S. Secretary of State James F. Byrnes to become the United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union. In putting Smith&#x27;s nomination for the post before the United States Senate, Truman asked for and received special legislation permitting Smith to retain his permanent military rank of major general.

Smith&#x27;s service as the American ambassador was eventful. Although it was not Smith&#x27;s fault, the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union during his tenure deteriorated rapidly as the Cold War set in. Smith&#x27;s tenacity of purpose was in line with the policy of containment that replaced about 1947 the conciliant stance that had for some years tried to find common ground with Moscow. He became convinced that no understanding was possible in dealings with the Soviets short of acquiescence to their expansionism, and that their intransigence and delaying tactics precluded the reconstruction and economic recovery of Europe. He saw the Soviet Union as a secretive, totalitarian, and antagonistic state. In &quot;My Three Years in Moscow&quot; (1950), Smith&#x27;s account of his time as ambassador, he wrote:

Smith returned to the United States in March 1949. Truman offered him the post of Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, but Smith declined the appointment and preferred to return to military duty. He was appointed as the commander of the First Army at Fort Jay in New York, his first command since 1918. Throughout the war, Smith had been troubled by a recurring stomach ulcer. The problem became severe in 1949. He was no longer able eat a normal diet, and he suffered from malnutrition. Smith was admitted to the Walter Reed Army Hospital, whose surgeons decided to remove most of his stomach. That did cure his ulcer, but Smith remained malnourished and thin.

===Director of Central Intelligence===
Truman selected Smith as Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), the head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Since the post had been established in 1946, there had been three directors, none of whom had wanted the position. Smith became the director on 7 October 1950.

The 1949 Intelligence Survey Group had produced the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report, which found that the CIA had failed in its responsibilities in both the coordination and production of intelligence. In response, the U.S. National Security Council accepted the conclusions and recommendations of the report. It remained to implement them. In May 1950, Truman decided that Smith was the man he needed for the CIA. Before Smith could assume the post on 7 October, there was a major intelligence failure. The North Korean invasion of South Korea in June 1950, which started the Korean War, took the administration entirely by surprise and raised fears of World War III.

Since Smith knew little about the CIA, he asked for a deputy who knew a lot. Sidney Souers, the executive secretary of the National Security Council, recommended William Harding Jackson, one of the authors of the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report, to Smith. Jackson accepted the post of deputy director on three conditions, one of which was &quot;no bawlings out.&quot;

Smith and Jackson moved to reorganize the agency in line with the recommendations of the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report. They streamlined procedures to gather and disseminate intelligence. On 10 October, Smith was asked to prepare estimates for the Wake Island Conference between the president and General Douglas MacArthur. Smith insisted for the estimates to be simple, readable, conclusive, and useful, rather than mere background. They reflected the best information available, but unfortunately, one estimate concluded that the Chinese would not intervene in Korea, which was another major intelligence failure.

Four months after the outbreak of the Korean War, the CIA had produced no co-ordinated estimate of the situation in Korea. Smith created a new Office of National Estimates (ONE) under the direction of William L. Langer, the Harvard historian who had led the Research and Analysis branch of the wartime Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Langer&#x27;s staff created procedures that were followed for the next two decades. Smith stepped up efforts to obtain economic, psychological, and photographic intelligence. By 1 December, Smith had formed a Directorate for Administration. The agency would ultimately be divided by function into three directorates: Administration, Plans, and Intelligence.

Smith is remembered in the CIA as its first successful Director of Central Intelligence and one of its most effective by redefining its structure and mission. The CIA&#x27;s expansive covert action program remained the responsibility of Frank Wisner&#x27;s quasi-independent Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), but Smith began to bring OPC under the DCI&#x27;s control. In early January 1951 he made Allen Dulles the first deputy director for plans (DDP), to supervise both OPC and the CIA&#x27;s separate espionage organization, the Office of Special Operations (OSO). Not until January 1952 were all intelligence functions consolidated under a deputy director for intelligence (DDI). Wisner succeeded Dulles as DDP in August 1951, and it took until August 1952 to merge the OSO and the OPC, each of which had its own culture, methods, and pay scales, into an effective, single directorate.

By consolidating responsibility for covert operations, Smith made the CIA the arm of government that was primarily responsible for them. Smith wanted the CIA to become a career service. Before the war, the so-called &quot;Manchu Law&quot; limited the duration of an officer&#x27;s temporary assignments, which effectively prevented anyone from making a career as a general staff officer. There were no schools for intelligence training, and the staffs had little to do in peacetime. Career officers therefore tended to avoid such work unless they aspired to be a military attaché. Smith consolidated training under a director of training and developed a career service program.

When Eisenhower was appointed as the Supreme Allied Commander Europe in 1951, he asked for Smith to serve as his chief of staff again. Truman turned down the request by stating that the DCI was a more important post. Eisenhower therefore took Lieutenant General Alfred Gruenther with him as his chief of staff. When Eisenhower later recommended Gruenther&#x27;s elevation to four-star rank, Truman decided that Smith should be promoted as well. However, Smith&#x27;s name was omitted from the promotion list. Truman then announced that no one would be promoted before Smith, which occurred on 1 August 1951. Smith retired from the Army upon leaving the CIA on 9 February 1953.

===Under Secretary of State===
On 11 January 1953, Eisenhower, now president-elect, announced that Smith would become an Under Secretary of State. Smith&#x27;s appointment was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on 6 February and he resigned as the DCI three days later. In May 1954, Smith traveled to Europe in an attempt to convince the British to participate in an intervention to avert French defeat in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. When that failed, he reached an agreement with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Vyacheslav Molotov to partition Vietnam into two separate zones.

In 1953, Guatemalan President Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán threatened to nationalize land belonging to the United Fruit Company. Smith ordered the American ambassador in Guatemala to put a CIA plan for a Guatemalan coup into effect, which was accomplished by the following year. Smith left the State Department on 1 October 1954 and took up a position with the United Fruit Company. He also served as president and chairman of the board of the Associated Missile Products Company and AMF Atomics Incorporated, vice chairman of American Machine and Foundry (AMF) and a director of RCA and Corning Incorporated.

===Final positions===
After retiring as Under Secretary of State in 1954, Smith continued to serve the Eisenhower administration in various posts. He was a member of the National Security Training Commission from 1955 to 1957, the National War College board of consultants from 1956 to 1959, the Office of Defense Mobilization Special Stockpile Advisory Committee from 1957 to 1958, the President&#x27;s Citizen Advisors on the Mutual Security Program from 1956 to 1957, and the President&#x27;s Committee on Disarmament in 1958.

Smith was a consultant at the Special Projects Office (Disarmament) in the Executive Office of the President from 1955 to 1956. He also served as chairman of the advisory council of the President&#x27;s Committee on Fund Raising and as a member-at-large from 1958 to 1961. In recognition of his other former boss, he was a member of the George C. Marshall Foundation Advisory Committee from 1960 to 1961.

In 1955, Smith was approached to perform the voice-over and opening scene for the film &quot;To Hell and Back&quot;, which was based on the autobiography of Audie Murphy. He accepted and had small parts in the movie, most notably in the beginning in which he was dressed in his old service uniform. He narrated several parts of the film and referred constantly to &quot;the foot soldier.&quot; Smith was portrayed on screen by Alexander Knox in &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962), Edward Binns in &quot;Patton&quot; (1970) and Timothy Bottoms in &quot;&quot; (2004). On television he has been portrayed by John Guerrasio in &quot;Cambridge Spies&quot; (2003), Charles Napier in &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; (1989), Don Fellows in &quot;The Last Days of Patton&quot; (1986) and J.D. Cannon in &quot;Ike: The War Years&quot; (1979).

==Death and legacy==
Smith suffered a heart attack on 9 August 1961 at his home in Washington, D.C., and he died in the ambulance on the way to Walter Reed Army Hospital. He was entitled to a Special Full Honor Funeral, but his widow requested that a simple joint service funeral be held, which was patterned after the one given to Marshall in 1959. She selected a grave site for her husband in Section 7 of Arlington National Cemetery, near Marshall&#x27;s grave. She was buried next to him after her death in 1963. Smith&#x27;s papers are in the Eisenhower Presidential Center in Abilene, Kansas.

<text>Jacaranda mimosifolia is a sub-tropical tree native to south-central South America that has been widely planted elsewhere because of its attractive and long-lasting violet-colored flowers. It is also known as the jacaranda, blue jacaranda, black poui, Nupur or fern tree. Older sources call it &quot;J. acutifolia&quot;, but it is nowadays more usually classified as &quot;J. mimosifolia&quot;. In scientific usage, the name &quot;jacaranda&quot; refers to the genus &quot;Jacaranda&quot;, which has many other members, but in horticultural and everyday usage, it nearly always means the blue jacaranda.

In its native range in the wild, &quot;J. mimosifolia&quot; is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN.

==Description==
The tree grows to a height of up to . Its bark is thin and gray-brown, smooth when the tree is young but eventually becoming finely scaly. The twigs are slender and slightly zigzag; they are a light reddish-brown. The flowers are up to long, and are grouped in panicles. They appear in spring and early summer, and last for up to two months. They are followed by woody seed pods, about in diameter, which contain numerous flat, winged seeds. The blue jacaranda is cultivated for the sake of its large compound leaves, even in areas where it rarely blooms. The leaves are up to long and bi-pinnately compound, with leaflets little more than long. There is a white form available from nurseries.

The unusually shaped, tough pods, which are across, are often gathered, cleaned and used to decorate Christmas trees and dried arrangements.

==Wood==

The wood is pale grey to whitish, straight-grained, relatively soft and knot-free. It dries without difficulty and is often used in its green or wet state for turnery and bowl carving.

==Habitat and range==
&quot;Jacaranda mimosifolia&quot; is native to southern Brazil, Paraguay, northern Argentina (Salta, Jujuy, Catamarca and Misiones provinces) and southern Bolivia. It is found in the Dry Chaco and flooded savannas, and in the Southern Andean Yungas of the eastern Andean piedmont and inter-Andean valleys, up to 2600 meters elevation. In its native range the tree is threatened by uncontrolled logging and clearing of land for agriculture, and is assessed as Vulnerable in the IUCN Red List.

The jacaranda is regarded as an invasive species in parts of South Africa and Queensland, Australia, where it can out-compete native species.

==Taxonomy==
The taxonomic status of the blue jacaranda is unsettled. ITIS regards the older name, &quot;J. acutifolia&quot;, as a synonym for &quot;J. mimosifolia&quot;. However, some modern taxonomists maintain the distinction between these two species, regarding them as geographically distinct: &quot;J. acutifolia&quot; is endemic to Peru, while &quot;J. mimosifolia&quot; is native to Bolivia and Argentina. If this distinction is made, cultivated forms should be treated as &quot;J. mimosifolia&quot;, since they are believed to derive from Argentine stock. Other synonyms for the blue jacaranda are &quot;J. chelonia&quot; and &quot;J. ovalifolia&quot;. The blue jacaranda belongs to the section &quot;Monolobos&quot; of the genus &quot;Jacaranda&quot;.

==Ornamental use==
The blue jacaranda has been cultivated in almost every part of the world where there is no risk of frost; established trees, however, tolerate brief spells of temperatures down to around . Even when young trees are damaged by a hard frost and suffer dieback, they will often rebound from the roots and grow in a shrub-like, multi-stemmed form. However, flowering and growth will be stunted if the jacaranda is grown directly on the California coast, where a lack of heat combined with cool ocean winds discourages flowering.

This plant has won the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==Notable cultivation==

Pretoria, the administrative capital of South Africa, is popularly known as Jacaranda City because of the large number of trees, which turn the city blue and purple when they flower in spring. The jacaranda trees, far from their native south-central South America (southern Brazil, Paraguay, northern Argentina and southern Bolivia), bloom every October. Water scarcity has South Africa trying to eradicate foreign species of plants and trees, including the jacaranda. Acknowledging the tree&#x27;s popularity with locals, the government announced in the early 2000s that it would not remove the trees, but had banned the planting of new jacarandas. However this position softened by 2016, and they were again allowed to be planted in urban environments in a number of provinces, although the position of councils like Johannesburg remained uncertain.

The first jacaranda bloomed in Sydney, Australia in about 1850. An 1865 report mentioned that Sydneysiders were visitng the Botanic Garden to see the tree&#x27;s &quot;luxuriant blossom&quot;. The same tree is now over 175 years old, and protected by ropes to prevent it falling apart. Jacarandas were first introduced to Brisbane in 1864, and there are guides tours of the best locations to view the flowers. The city of Grafton on the north coast of New South Wales has a jacaranda festival each year in late October and early November. 

In the United States, the jacaranda is grown extensively in California, the Southwest, southeast Texas and Florida. Jacaranda can be found throughout most of Southern California, where they were imported by the horticulturalist Kate Sessions. They are also planted as far north as the San Francisco Bay Area and along the frost-free coastal regions of Northern California. In San Francisco, they can only be grown in the city&#x27;s warmest microclimates, such as Potrero Hill and the Mission District. Phoenix, Arizona and San Diego, California are known for them. They also grow in Hawaii.

It is one of the most common trees in Argentina&#x27;s capital city, Buenos Aires. Jacarandas can also be found in many parts of Mexico City and are usually in full bloom in March.

In Europe the jacaranda is grown on the Mediterranean coast of Spain (it is prominent in the Valencian Community, the Balearic Islands and Andalusia, with especially large specimens present in Valencia, Alicante and Seville, and usually with earlier flowering than in the rest of Europe), in southern Portugal (notably in Lisbon), southern Italy (Naples and Cagliari have many mature specimens), southern Greece (especially Athens) and the islands of Malta and Cyprus.

Jacaranda are also widely common in cities across Southern Africa. It was introduced to Cape Town; then Johannesburg; Lusaka, Zambia; Gaborone, Botswana; Nairobi, Kenya; and Harare, Zimbabwe. Beyond the region, Jacaranda are also cultivated in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal and Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, and Jharkhand states in India. it is also a common sight in Israel, mainly in the towns and cities of the coastal plain. As mentioned above, the trees are best associated with spring in the cities of Pretoria and Harare, the respective capitals of South Africa and Zimbabwe.

==In popular culture==
The Australian Christmas song &quot;Christmas Where the Gum Trees Grow&quot; makes reference to jacaranda trees, as the blooms are only seen in summer time—as the song explains, &quot;When the bloom of the jacaranda tree is here, Christmas time is near&quot;. 

The movie musical &quot;Encanto&quot;, set in Colombia, references the plant in the song &quot;What Else Can I Do&quot;. Isabela Madrigal explores her plant-summoning powers, she creates, and mentions by line, &quot;a hurricane of jacarandas&quot;. 

References to the jacaranda plant recur in the musical work of Trevor Rabin, providing the title of his 2012 solo album and also appearing in the lyrics of &quot;I&#x27;m Running&quot;, a song which he co-wrote and performed as part of Yes and which appeared on their 1987 album &quot;Big Generator&quot;. The plant has also lent its name to his home studio, The Jacaranda Room.

In Argentina, writer Alejandro Dolina, in his book &quot;Crónicas del Ángel Gris&quot; (&quot;Chronicles of the Gray Angel&quot;), tells the legend of a massive &quot;jacarandá&quot; tree, planted in Plaza Flores in Buenos Aires, that was able to whistle tango songs on demand. María Elena Walsh dedicated her song &quot;Canción del Jacarandá&quot; to the tree. Miguel Brascó&#x27;s folk song &quot;Santafesino de veras&quot; mentions the aroma of &quot;jacarandá&quot; as a defining feature of the littoral Santa Fe Province (along with the willows growing by the rivers).

===Exam folklore===
The University of Queensland in Brisbane is particularly well known for its ornamental jacarandas, and a common maxim among students holds that the blooming of the jacarandas signals the time for serious study for end-of-year exams; the jacaranda when in bloom is also known as the exam tree. Purple panic is a term used by students in south-east Queensland for student stress during the period of late spring and early summer. The &quot;purple&quot; refers to the flowers of Jacaranda trees, which bloom at that time and have been extensively planted throughout that district. The &quot;panic&quot; refers to the need to be completing assignments and studying for final exams.

Conversely, while the time of year the jacarandas bloom in Pretoria coincides with the year-end exams at the University of Pretoria, legend has it there that if a flower from a jacaranda drops on a student&#x27;s head, the student will pass all their exams.

<text>U.S. Route 25 or U.S. Highway 25 (US 25) is a north–south United States Numbered Highway that runs for in the Southern and Midwestern U.S. Its southern terminus is in Brunswick, Georgia, from where it proceeds mostly due north, passing through the cities of Augusta, Georgia; Greenville, South Carolina; and Asheville, North Carolina, before dividing into two branches, known as US 25W and US 25E between Newport, Tennessee, and North Corbin, Kentucky. After passing through Richmond and Lexington, Kentucky, it reaches its northern terminus at Ohio state line in Covington, Kentucky. The route is an important crossing of the Appalachian Mountains, and it is covered by three of the corridors of the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS). When the highway was originally established in 1926, the route extended from North Augusta, South Carolina, to Port Huron, Michigan. The southern end was extended to its current terminus in 1936, while the northern end was truncated in 1974.

===Georgia===

Starting at the intersection of US 17/State Route 25 in Brunswick, US 25 goes northwest to Jesup then northeast to Ludowici. It then stays at a general north route through the cities of Statesboro, Millen, Waynesboro, and finally Augusta, where it crosses the Savannah River into South Carolina. As it led south from Augusta, the predecessor thoroughfare was known as the &quot;Southeastern Plank Road&quot; which later became &quot;Peach Orchard Road&quot; which name is still in use in southern Richmond County. The plank road likely connected with the Florida–Georgia Plank Road from Brunswick to Jacksonville, Florida. Currently, the overall majority of US 25 is four lanes.

===South Carolina===
Entering South Carolina from Augusta, Georgia, US 25 goes north through downtown North Augusta, connecting with Interstate 20 (I-20) just outside town. US 25 goes northwesterly through the cities of Edgefield, Greenwood, and Greenville, going due north at Travelers Rest to the North Carolina state line. Majority of the route is four lanes, with various sections at expressway grade.

===North Carolina===

US 25 becomes a freeway from the state line in Tuxedo, in Henderson County. It continues for before connecting with I-26/US 74 near East Flat Rock. Splitting from I-26/US 74 near Fletcher, it goes north through Arden, Biltmore Forest, and downtown Asheville, before reconnecting with I-26 near Woodfin. At Weaverville, US 25 and US 70 travel northwesterly together, through Marshall and Hot Springs into Tennessee.

===Tennessee===

In concurrency with US 70 and State Route 9 (SR 9), US 25 enters the state through the Bald Mountains, followed by crossing the French Broad River along Wolf Creek Bridge. Along the northern bank of the French Broad River, it crosses back over and leaves the Cherokee National Forest. US 25 enters Newport, after crossing the Pigeon River, and serves as Broadway Street through the downtown area. At the western edge of Newport, US 25 splits: US 25E toward Morristown and US 25W toward Knoxville.

===U.S. Route 25E===

Traversing a from Newport, Tennessee, to North Corbin, Kentucky, US 25E connects the cities of White Pine, Morristown, Bean Station, Tazewell, and Harrogate in Tennessee. Entering Kentucky via the Cumberland Gap Tunnel, it connects the cities of Middlesboro and Barbourville. In North Corbin, after merging back with US 25W, a US 25E connector continues west to I-75.

===U.S. Route 25W===

Traversing a from Newport, Tennessee, to North Corbin, Kentucky, US 25W goes west connecting Dandridge and Knoxville and northwest to Clinton. Going north in parallel or in concurrency with I-75, it goes through Caryville, Jacksboro, LaFollette, and Jellico, before crossing the Tennessee–Kentucky line. Continuing north, it goes through Williamsburg before going through downtown Corbin and then reconnecting with US 25E in North Corbin.

===Kentucky===

US 25 starts again in North Corbin and traverses north, in parallel with I-75, connecting the cities of London, Berea, Richmond, Lexington, and Dry Ridge. US 25 ends in Covington at the Ohio state line over the Ohio River along the Clay Wade Bailey Bridge; US 42/US 127 continue into Cincinnati.

US 25 overlaps with three corridors that are part of the ADHS, which is part of Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC). Passed in 1965, the purpose of the ADHS is to generate economic development in previously isolated areas, supplement the Interstate System, connect Appalachia to the Interstate System, and provide access to areas within the region as well as to markets in the rest of the nation.

* Corridor F: From I-75, in Caryville, Tennessee, to US 23, in Jenkins, Kentucky. US 25W overlaps a section in Caryville; though already a four-lane boulevard, it is slated to be improved upon in that area. US 25E overlaps a section, centered around the Cumberland Gap area. From Harrogate, Tennessee, to Pineville, Kentucky, US 25E is a mostly four-lane limited-access road with interchanges at major intersections.
* Corridor S: From I-81, near Morristown, Tennessee, to SR 63, in Harrogate, Tennessee. The entire section of US 25E is authorized for ADHS funding. , is still slated for construction along the route. Cutting through various mountain ridges, US 25E provides a four-lane limited-access road with interchanges at major intersections.
* Corridor W: From I-85, in Greenville, South Carolina, to I-26/US 74, near East Flat Rock, North Carolina. Of the section of US 25, only was authorized for ADHS funding. In 2013, both states have completed Corridor W. US 25 in South Carolina provides a four-to-six-lane limited-access road, with interchanges at major intersections; while US 25 in North Carolina is a four-lane controlled-access highway.

==History==
US 25 was established on November 11, 1926, as part of the original U.S. Numbered Highway System; it was routed along the Dixie Highway from North Augusta, South Carolina, to Port Huron, Michigan, with two divides (US 25E and US 25W) through Tennessee and Kentucky, with US 25E having also a short section in Virginia. In 1928, one divided section between Richmond and Newport, Kentucky, was removed; US 25 followed the US 25W routing, while US 25E was mostly replaced by US 27. In 1929, US 25 was extended south into Georgia, ending at US 80 near Statesboro, Georgia. In 1933, US 25 was extended north from Port Huron to Port Austin, Michigan. In 1936, US 25 was extended south again to its current terminus at US 17 in Brunswick, Georgia. In 1957, US 25 was shifted onto new four-lane road in Richmond County, Georgia.

In 1974, US 25 was eliminated in Ohio and Michigan, establishing its northern terminus on the Clay Wade Bailey Bridge in Covington, Kentucky. Its former alignment was replaced by I-75 between Cincinnati and Detroit, and I-94 between Detroit and Port Huron. M-25 continues as the designation of former US 25 between Port Huron and Port Austin, while Ohio State Route 25 much of the former route from Toledo to near Cygnet, Ohio.

In 2000, US 25E was rerouted through the Cumberland Gap Tunnel (opened four years prior), making a direct link between Tennessee and Kentucky, eliminating Virginia&#x27;s short section. Its old alignment that went through historic Cumberland Gap was handed over to the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park, and the former roadbed through the park restored to an early 19th-century wagon path.

<text>The Hunting of the President is a 2004 English-language documentary film about former US President Bill Clinton. Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton appear in archived footage. The film is based on the book The Hunting of the President: The Ten Year Campaign to Destroy Bill and Hillary Clinton, written by investigative journalists Joe Conason and Gene Lyons, and published by Thomas Dunne Books in 2000. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film premiered at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival.

The book and movie explore Clinton friends Jim and Susan McDougal, former Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell, and Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker. Interviewed for the book and movie, Susan McDougal discusses legal threats from the independent counsel to pressure her to implicate the Clintons in something illegal. She told the independent counsel the Clintons did nothing wrong, and the independent counsel said they had statements prepared and she simply had to agree with the pre-written claims.

The film was nominated for Best Documentary Screenplay from the Writers Guild of America.

<text>Johannes Dieckmann (19 January 1893 – 22 February 1969) was a German journalist and politician who served as the 1st President of the Volkskammer, the parliament of East Germany, from 1949 to 1969.

==Biography==
Dieckmann was born in Fischerhude in the Prussian Province of Hanover, the son of a Protestant pastor. He studied economics and philosophy at the universities of Berlin, where he joined the Verein Deutscher Studenten (VDSt), a German Studentenverbindung, Giessen, Göttingen and Freiburg. In 1916 he was recruited to the German Army and was severely injured in World War I, being declared permanently invalid. Nevertheless, he was later mobilised to the Italian campaign in 1917. During the German Revolution in November 1918, he became chairman of a Soldiers&#x27; council.

After the war, he joined the liberal German People&#x27;s Party (DVP) and became a close associate of Gustav Stresemann in his election campaign. In March 1919, he became a DVP party secretary in constituency Weser-Ems, and in 1921 he was sent by Stresemann to the Duisburg/Oberhausen constituency. During the Belgian occupation in 1922, he was briefly imprisoned for publishing a journal not approved by the occupation authorities. During the Weimar Republic, Dieckmann held various posts within DVP regional leadership and was a member of the Saxon Landtag for DVP from the end of 1929 to February 1933.

After the Nazi seizure of power in January 1933, Dieckmann lost his office and worked from October 5, 1933 to August 30, 1939 in fuel and oilshale companies. From August 1939 to January 1941 he was mobilised again and participated in the French campaign; from January 15, 1941 to 1945 he worked in the Silesian industrial business. After the failed coup attempt against Hitler, when Johannes Dieckmann’s cousin Wilhelm Dieckmann (1893–1944) was executed for connections with the plotters, Johannes Dieckmann was put under cautious surveillance by Gestapo. After the war, Dieckmann established &quot;Sächsisches Tageblatt&quot; and led Sächsischer Kohlekontor GmbH.

In October 1945, he was a co-founder of Kulturbund. In 1945, he with his Bundesbruder Hermann Kastner (1886–1956) were some of the founders of &quot;Demokratische Partei Deutschlands&quot; (later renamed Liberal-Demokratische Partei Deutschlands); Dieckmann remained member of the party’s central management (Zentralvorstand). From 1946 to 1952 he was a LDPD MP and chairman of the LDPD faction in the &quot;Landtag&quot; of Saxony and its &quot;Präsidium&quot;. In that post, he helped push out the more courageous members of his party and led it into the National Front of the GDR, which included official political and social organisations and was effectively controlled by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.

From 1950 on, Dieckmann was a member of the &quot;Präsidium&quot; of the National Front.

Later, from 10 March 1948 to 11 December 1949, he was Minister of Justice of the State of Saxony and deputy &quot;Ministerpräsident&quot; of Saxony. In 1948/49 Dieckmann was a member of the German Economic Commission (German: Deutsche Wirtschaftskommission or DWK), a member of the German People’s Council (Volksrat) and its constitution committee. He also acted as the president (chairman) of the provisional People’s Chamber and the permanent People’s Chamber (Volkskammer), the parliament of the GDR, a post he held until his death.

As such he was acting head of state after president Wilhelm Pieck&#x27;s death on 7 September 1960, until the presidency was replaced by the State Council five days later. Dieckmann was elected one of the deputy chairmen of the State Council, a post he held until his death.

A member of the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany, one of several parties in the socialist system of East Germany, Dieckmann was already a founding member of the Society for Studying the Culture of the Soviet Union (&quot;Gesellschaft zum Studium der Kultur der Sowjetunion&quot;; from 1949: Gesellschaft für Deutsch-Sowjetische Freundschaft) in 1947. He became one of its leaders and from 1963 to 1968 was the president of the association. He was the Chairman of Permanent Delegation of the GDR for the &quot;International Conference for the Peaceful Solution to the German Question&quot; and Chairman of the &quot;Foundation of Veterans for People’s Solidarity&quot;.
