<text>The United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (USPHSCC; also referred to as the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health Service) is the uniformed service branch of the United States Public Health Service and one of the eight uniformed services of the United States (along with the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Air Force, Space Force, and NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps). The commissioned corps&#x27; primary mission is the protection, promotion, and advancement of health and safety of the general public.

Along with the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps, the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps is one of two uniformed services that consist only of commissioned officers and has no enlisted or warrant officer ranks, although warrant officers have been authorized for use within the service. Officers of the commissioned corps are classified as noncombatants, unless directed to serve as part of the military by the president or detailed to a service branch of the military. Members of the commissioned corps wear uniforms modeled after the United States Navy and the United States Coast Guard, with special Public Health Service Commissioned Corps insignia, and hold naval ranks equivalent to officers of the Navy and Coast Guard, along with corresponding in-service medical titles. Commissioned corps officers typically receive their commissions through the commissioned corps&#x27;s direct commissioning program.

As with its parent division, the Public Health Service, the commissioned corps is under the direction of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The commissioned corps is led by the surgeon general, who holds the rank of vice admiral (O-9). The surgeon general reports directly to the Department of Health and Human Services assistant secretary for health. The assistant secretary for health may be appointed to the rank of admiral (O-10) if they are also a serving uniformed officer of the commissioned corps.

==History==
The Public Health Service Commissioned Corps had its beginnings with the creation of the Marine Hospital Fund in 1798, which later was reorganized in 1871 as the Marine Hospital Service. The Marine Hospital Service was charged with the care and maintenance of merchant sailors, but as the country grew, so did the ever-expanding mission of the service. The Marine Hospital Service soon began taking on new expanding health roles that included such health initiatives that protected the commerce and health of America. One such role was quarantine.

John Maynard Woodworth, a famous surgeon of the Union Army who served under General William Tecumseh Sherman, was appointed in 1871 as the supervising surgeon. Woodworth&#x27;s title was later changed to &quot;Supervising Surgeon General&quot;, which later became the surgeon general. Woodworth is credited with the formal creation of the commissioned corps. Woodworth organized the Marine Hospital Service medical personnel along Army military structure in 1889 to facilitate a mobile force of health professionals that could be moved for the needs of the service and country. He established appointment standards and designed the Marine Hospital Service herald of a fouled anchor and caduceus. Later that year of 1889, President Grover Cleveland signed an Act into law that formally established the modern Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (then the Marine Hospital Service) under the Supervising Surgeon (later Surgeon General). At first open only to physicians, over the course of the 20th century, the Corps expanded to 11 careers in a wide range of specialties to include veterinarians, dentists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, engineers, pharmacists, nurses, environmental health specialists, scientists, dietitians, and other allied health professionals.

Today, the commissioned corps is under the United States Public Health Service (PHS), a major agency now of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), established by Congress in 1979 and 1980. It was previously established in 1953 as the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW), and it is still led by the surgeon general. The commissioned corps allocates officers to all of the other uniformed services depending on the health or medical needs of each service.

By the 1980s, the wearing of uniforms on a day-to-day basis was not consistently practiced. In 1987, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop advocated for consistent use of the uniform while on duty, although he allowed individual agencies to determine their own requirements. In 2004, Surgeon General Richard Carmona made uniforms compulsory whenever officers were on duty.

The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act established a Ready Reserve Corps for the PHSCC, but technical errors in the legislation prevented it from being implemented until the errors were corrected in the 2020 CARES Act.

According to , service in the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps after 30 June 1960, is considered military service for retirement purposes. Under , active service in the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps is considered active military service for the purposes of most veterans&#x27; benefits.

==Purpose==
The stated mission of the commissioned corps of the U.S. Public Health Service is &quot;Protecting, promoting, and advancing the health and safety of the Nation&quot; in accordance with the commissioned corps&#x27;s four Core Values: Leadership, Excellence, Integrity, and Service. Officers execute the mission of the commissioned corps in the following ways:
* Help provide healthcare and related services to medically underserved populations: to Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and to other population groups with special needs;
* Prevent and control disease, identify health hazards in the environment and help correct them, and promote healthy lifestyles for the nation&#x27;s citizens;
* Improve the nation&#x27;s mental health;
* Ensure that drugs and medical devices are safe and effective, food is safe and wholesome, cosmetics are harmless, and that electronic products do not expose users to dangerous amounts of radiation;
* Conduct and support biomedical, behavioral, and health services research, and communicate research results to health professionals and the public; and
* Work with other nations and international agencies on global health problems and their solutions.

As of 2019, the most common agency for commissioned corps officers was the Indian Health Service, followed by the Food and Drug Administration, and then the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The increased benefits and pay of commissioned corps officers is considered especially beneficial for the Indian Health Service, where recruitment is difficult due to the remote locations of many of its jobs.

In addition, the commissioned corps provides officers (medical officers, dental officers, therapists, environmental health officers, etc.) to other uniformed services, primarily the United States Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps (NOAA Corps), which do not commission their own medical or dental officers. The Commissioned Corps provides a number of officers to support the Coast Guard throughout the country, including within the Coast Guard&#x27;s senior leadership: The Coast Guard&#x27;s chief medical officer is a rear admiral in the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps.

Commissioned corps officers also may be detailed to other U.S. Government agencies, including the Department of Defense, TRICARE, the Department of Justice (Federal Bureau of Prisons), the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of the Interior (National Park Service). Commissioned Corps officers may develop individual memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with other organizations, including state and local health agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

The commissioned corps is often called upon by other federal, state, and local agencies to aid and augment in times when those agencies&#x27; resources are overwhelmed. These responses are designated as deployments by the Commissioned Corps, if the deployment is outside of the officer&#x27;s normal duties, and coordinated through the Commissioned Corps&#x27;s Readiness and Deployment Branch (RDB) in Commissioned Corps Headquarters (CCHQ). Deployments may be for technical needs in standard settings, or in the event of disasters, in austere environments.

The commissioned corps may be militarized by an act of Congress or by executive order by the president of the United States, not only in time of war, but also in &quot;an emergency involving the national defense proclaimed by the President.&quot; . states:&lt;poem&gt;In time of war, or of emergency involving the national defense proclaimed by the President, he may by Executive order declare the commissioned corps of the Service to be a military service. Upon such declaration, and during the period of such war or such emergency or such part thereof as the President shall prescribe, the commissioned corps (a) shall constitute a branch of the land and naval forces of the United States, (b) shall, to the extent prescribed by regulations of the President, be subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, et seq., and (c) shall continue to operate as part of the Service except to the extent that the President may direct as Commander in Chief.&lt;/poem&gt; Major militarization of the Commissioned Corps occurred during World War II (1941–1945) and the Korean War (1950–1953). Should it be called into active duty again, it would constitute a seventh branch of the United States Armed Forces.

==Deployments==

The commissioned corps is often deployed as part of the National Response Framework Emergency Support Function No. 8 – Public Health and Medical Services, but can be deployed outside of the Framework for various needs to other federal agencies, states, local governments, or even to aid foreign governments. Like all other federal-level responses, commissioned corps officers are deployed only upon request, and upon the recommendation of the surgeon general and permission of the assistant secretary for health. During deployments, commissioned corps officers may report to regular office spaces, such as coordinating responses at state-of-the-art emergency operations centers, or into the field in extremely austere environments, such as when responding to a natural disaster. In addition, deployments may either be on an individual basis, such as when specific skill sets are needed, or as part of a team, when large-scale responses are needed.

The commissioned corps organizes PHS officers into units for rapid deployment. PHS officers are either assigned to a pre-configured rapid deployment unit (RDU) or a group augmenting those units. PHS officers must be prepared to deploy within 48 hours of receipt of deployment orders. Rapid deployment units include Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) teams that are made up of over 100 officers with multiple specialties, and are focused on providing acute clinical care of disaster-exacerbated chronic conditions. Officers who do not work as a clinical care provider on one of these teams are often in support roles, such as logistics, administration/finance, or planning. Tier 2 teams are composed of a smaller, more specialized workforce. Other rapid deployment units include the Applied Public Health Team (APHT), the Mental Health Team (MHT), and the Services Access Team (SAT). PHS officers not already assigned to one of the rapid deployment units are used to augment the other teams in the event of staffing shortages due to availability, or the need to scale up a response.

Commissioned Corps personnel are trained and equipped to respond to public health crises and national emergencies, such as natural disasters, disease outbreaks, or terrorist attacks. The teams are multidisciplinary and are capable of responding to domestic and international humanitarian missions. Some notable deployments involving the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps include:
* 1989 – Hurricane Hugo; Loma Prieta, California, earthquake.
* 1992 – More than 1,000 PHS officers were deployed to South Dade County, Florida, following Hurricane Andrew.
* Early 1990s – Flooding throughout the United States and Alaska.
* 1994 – Northridge, California, earthquake.
* 1995 – Bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
* 1995 – Hundreds of PHS officers were deployed to the U.S. Virgin Islands following Hurricane Marilyn.
* 1999 – Hospital center at Fort Dix, New Jersey, for Kosovo Refugees
* 2001 – More than 1,000 PHS officers were deployed to New York City after the attacks on September 11, 2001 to aid victims and provide medical and mental health services to responders and rescue workers.
* 2001 – 2001 anthrax attacks
* 2004 – Hurricane Ivan.
* 2004 – 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami
* 2005 – More than 2,000 PHS officers deployed to set up field hospitals and render aid and assistance to evacuees and responders in the wakes of Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Rita, and Hurricane Wilma.
* 2006 – 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake
* 2007 – Medicine Contamination in Panama
* 2008 – PHS-2 Rapid Deployment Force deployed pre-landfall to Louisiana in advance of Hurricane Gustav. It became the first standing PHS team to set up and run a Federal Medical Station. The team and 200 patients rode out the hurricane in Alexandria&#x27;s Riverfront Center. RDF-1 and RDF-3 deployed pre-landfall in advance of Hurricane Ike to set up Federal Medical Stations in College Station, Texas, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, respectively.
* 2008 – Hurricane Ike
* 2009 – 2009 Samoa earthquake and tsunami
* 2010 – Haiti earthquake; Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
* 2011 – 2011 Japan tsunami and earthquake
* 2012 – Hurricane Sandy.
* 2014 – 2014 American immigration crisis of Unaccompanied Minor Children.
* 2014–2015 – Ebola outbreak response including Ebola virus epidemic in Liberia—Ebola field hospital for health workers at Harbel near Monrovia
* 2016–present – Great Plains region of the Indian Health Service.
* 2017–present – Hurricane Maria, Hurricane Irma, and Hurricane Harvey
* 2020–present – COVID-19 pandemic

In addition to disaster response, the commissioned corps frequently partners with the United States Navy on health diplomacy missions. Commissioned Corps officers have been part of the Navy&#x27;s Pacific Partnership (in the Pacific basin) and Operation Continuing Promise (in the Caribbean and western Atlantic) since 2007. Such missions are often carried out on one of the Navy&#x27;s commissioned hospital ships ( and ), though other ships, such as the amphibious assault ship , have also been used. The command staff of the PHS deployed team(s) is deployed for the entire mission duration (often three months), while operational personnel serve one month aboard, meeting and departing the ships at the ports of call during the mission.

== Ready Reserve Corps ==

The Affordable Care Act (ACA), signed by President Barack Obama on 23 March 2010, established the Ready Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps as the new surge capacity for the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. The ready reserve corps is intended to fulfill the need for additional commissioned personnel on short notice to assist Regular Corps personnel for both routine public health and emergency response missions during involuntary calls to active duty.

The Ready Reserve Corps replaced the former Reserve Corps, which had active and inactive components. All former Reserve Corps officers who were serving on extended active duty on 23 March 2010 were converted to Regular Corps officers. The same legislation also abolished the Inactive Reserve Corps (IRC) on 23 March 2010, and consequently the commissions of the existing 10,000 commissioned corps IRC officers. The IRC had consisted of inactive reservists voluntarily activating to provide over 3,000 active-duty days annually for routine and public health emergencies including during Hurricane Katrina and other emergency response missions, and in providing surge capacity for numerous shortages in isolated and hardship underserved areas. Inactive reservists also played roles in the humanitarian shipboard training missions with other uniformed services.

A Ready Reserve Corps Working Integrated Project Team was convened in April 2010 to propose policy concepts, a strategic framework, and a budget. It submitted its final report in June 2010. As of late 2010, the directives and policies to implement the Ready Reserve awaited Secretarial decisions.

However, due to a technical error, the ACA failed to include statutory authority for pay and benefits, preventing the Ready Reserve Corps from being activated. Efforts to pass legislation to correct these errors picked up in late 2019. Funding was finally approved through the CARES Act, passed on 18 March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The first officers were expected to be commissioned in the first half of 2021.

The Ready Reserve has three main components. The Selected Ready Reserve (SELRES) consists of officers who are required to train periodically and must be prepared for voluntary or involuntary active duty mobilization within 24 hours to respond to an urgent or emergency public health care need. The Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) consists of officers who have had military and/or USPHS Commissioned Corps training; they are not required to participate in training or other USPHS Commissioned Corps activities, but are subject to involuntary recall to active duty under certain circumstances. The Retired Reserve consists of members who accumulate 20 or more years of qualifying service and have reached age 60.

==Ranks and insignia==

The Commissioned Corps adopted naval ranks to impose military discipline on the doctors of the service, and their medical titles correspond with their service rank and pay grade. The service uses officer ranks and service titles interchangeably when referring to the grades of its officers.

The commissioned corps uses the same commissioned officer rank structure as the United States Navy and Coast Guard: from ensign to admiral (O-1 through O-10). Commissioned corps officers are typically appointed via direct commission and must complete a two-week officer basic course (OBC) before entering active duty. Commissioned corps officers receive the same pay and benefits as other members of the uniformed services. They cannot hold a dual commission with another uniformed service but inter-service transfers are permitted via .

The commissioned corps is authorized to use warrant officer ranks W-1 to W-4 but does not currently use these ranks.

Unlike their United States Armed Forces counterparts, Commissioned Corps officers do not require their rank appointments and promotions to be confirmed by the United States Senate, and only require approval from the president. Officers serving as assistant secretary for health and the surgeon general however, do require senatorial confirmation due to their status as senior federal officials.

==Rank flags==

Flag officers of the Commissioned Corps are authorized to use rank flags. When the Department of Health and Human Services assistant secretary for health is a Commissioned Corps admiral, he or she is authorized use of the flag of the Assistant Secretary for Health as a four-star rank flag. The Commissioned Corps vice admiral serving as Surgeon General of the United States uses the flag of the surgeon general as a three-star rank flag, while the Commissioned Corps rear admiral serving as deputy surgeon general uses the deputy surgeon general&#x27;s flag as a two-star rank flag. Other Commissioned Corps rear admirals use a two-star assistant surgeon general flag, and Commissioned Corps officers at the rank of rear admiral (lower half) use a one-star assistant surgeon general flag.

==Officer specialty rates==

The members of the Commissioned Corps number over 6,000 officers in 11 professional categories:
* Dentist
* Dietitian
* Engineer
* Environmental health officers
* Health services
** Basic and Applied Science
** Dental Hygiene
** Healthcare Administration
** Health information technology
** Medical Laboratory Science
** Optometry
** Physician assistant
** Podiatry
** Public health
** Psychology
** Social Work
* Nurse
* Medical Officer
* Pharmacist
* Scientist
* Therapist (including physical, occupational, speech, respiratory)
* Veterinarian

The Health Services Officer (HSO) category comprises over 50 allied health specialties, including audiology, social workers, physician assistants, optometrists, statisticians, computer scientists, dental hygienists, medical records administrators, medical technologists and others.

==Uniforms==

Commissioned Corps officers wear uniforms similar to those of the United States Navy and the United States Coast Guard with special Public Health Service insignia. Their service dress blues, summer whites, and service khakis are modeled after the Navy&#x27;s, and their operational dress uniform was modeled after the Coast Guard&#x27;s. When attached to another uniformed service, a Commissioned Corps officer is subject to the grooming standards of that service for uniform appearance. Because of the close relationship between the Commissioned Corps and the Coast Guard, a Commissioned Corps officer on assignment with the Coast Guard is required to wear the same service uniforms as commissioned Coast Guard officers, although still wearing the insignia of the Commissioned Corps to identify them.

== March of the United States Public Health Service ==

Senior Musician George King III, U.S. Coast Guard (Retired) composed the &quot;U.S. Public Health Service March&quot; in the late 1980s, and presented the copyright to the PHS Surgeon General, by whom it is still held. The PHS is the only one of the uniformed services in which the copyright is held by the titular head of the Corps. In addition, King composed the Centennial Fanfare, &quot;Anchor and Caduceus&quot;, for the PHS Corps Centennial event in 1989. 

The U.S. Coast Guard Band recorded both the PHS March and Centennial Fanfare for the Public Health Service and presented it to the PHS during their centennial.  At the Washington gala celebrating the event in January of 1989, the Coast Guard Band played and Senior Musician King conducted, for the premier of the fanfare. The only coast guardsman so honored, Senior Musician King was presented the PHS Citation by Surgeon General Koop for his special service. The lyrics are as follows:

&lt;poem&gt;The mission of our service is known the world around
In research and in treatment no equal can be found
In the silent war against disease no truce is ever seen
We serve on the land and the sea for humanity
The Public Health Service Team&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="750092" wikidata="Q6604710" url="?curid=750092" title="List of Zulu War Victoria Cross recipients">
<text>The Victoria Cross (VC) was awarded to 23 members of the British Armed Forces and colonial forces for actions performed during the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879. The Victoria Cross is a military decoration awarded for valour &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; to members of the armed forces of some Commonwealth countries and previous British Empire territories. The VC was introduced in Great Britain on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to reward acts of valour during the Crimean War, and takes precedence over all other orders, decorations and medals. It may be awarded to a person of any rank in any service and to civilians under military command. The first ceremony was held on 26 June 1857, when Queen Victoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in Hyde Park.

The Anglo-Zulu War (also known as the Zulu War) was fought in 1879 between the British Empire and the Zulu Kingdom (Zululand; part of modern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa). Although British and colonial forces under General Lord Chelmsford entered Zululand unopposed, on 11 January 1879, the Zulu army soon inflicted a heavy defeat on them at the Battle of Isandlwana, in which more than 1,300 British and colonial forces were killed. Immediately after the battle, Zulu troops moved onto the small garrison at Rorke&#x27;s Drift. Here, just over 150 British and colonial soldiers defended the outpost against 4,000 Zulu warriors. The action was later made famous by the film &quot;Zulu&quot;. The defence of Rorke&#x27;s Drift is considered by historians as a masterly defensive action and an example of heroism against overwhelming numbers. Eleven VC recipients received their awards for deeds performed during the defence of the small garrison – one of the largest number awarded for a single action, and the largest number (7) awarded to a single unit (the 2nd/24th Foot) for a single action. The severe losses at Isandlwana resulted in Lord Chelmsford having to abandon his initial invasion plan and to request significant reinforcements before another could be attempted. After these reinforcements arrived, a second invasion was launched in May. The second invasion culminated in the defeat of the Zulu army at the Battle of Ulundi, on 4 July 1879. The war saw the end of the Zulu nation&#x27;s independence as it became a protectorate of the British.

Under the original Royal Warrant, the VC could not be awarded posthumously. Between 1879 and 1901, several notices were issued in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; regarding soldiers who would have been awarded the VC had they survived. In a partial reversal of policy in 1902, six of the soldiers mentioned were granted the VC, but not &quot;officially&quot; awarded the medal. In 1907, the posthumous policy was completely reversed and medals were sent to the next of kin of the six officers and men; Nevill Coghill and Teignmouth Melvill were two of the soldiers who were decorated thus. The Victoria Cross warrant was not officially amended to include posthumous awards until 1920 but one quarter of all awards for the First World War were posthumous.

<text>Madeira is a Portuguese island, and is the largest and most populous of the Madeira Archipelago. It has an area of , including Ilhéu de Agostinho, Ilhéu de São Lourenço, Ilhéu Mole (northwest). As of 2021, Madeira had a total population of 245,595.

The island is the top of a massive submerged shield volcano that rises about from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. The volcano formed atop an east–west rift in the oceanic crust along the African Plate, beginning during the Miocene epoch over 5 million years ago, continuing into the Pleistocene until about 700,000 years ago. This was followed by extensive erosion, producing two large amphitheatres open to south in the central part of the island. Volcanic activity later resumed, producing scoria cones and lava flows atop the older eroded shield. The most recent volcanic eruptions were on the west-central part of the island only 6,500 years ago, creating more cinder cones and lava flows.

Madeira is the largest island of the group with an area of , a length of (from Ponta de São Lourenço to Ponta do Pargo), while approximately at its widest point (from Ponta da Cruz to Ponta de São Jorge), with a coastline of . It has a mountain ridge that extends along the centre of the island, reaching at its highest point (Pico Ruivo), while much lower (below ) along its eastern extent. The primitive volcanic foci responsible for the central mountainous area, consisted of the peaks: Ruivo (), Torres (), Arieiro (), Cidrão (), Cedro (), Casado (), Grande (), Ferreiro (). At the end of this eruptive phase, an island circled by reefs was formed, its marine vestiges are evident in a calcareous layer in the area of Lameiros, in São Vicente (which was later explored for calcium oxide production). Sea cliffs, such as Cabo Girão, valleys and ravines extend from this central spine, making the interior generally inaccessible. Daily life is concentrated in the many villages at the mouths of the ravines, through which the heavy rains of autumn and winter usually travel to the sea.

<text>Jacob Friedrich von Abel (9 May 1751 – 7 July 1829) was a German philosopher. His main interest was the human soul and in trying to find a proof for its immortality.

Born in Vaihingen an der Enz, von Abel studied philology, philosophy and theology in the lower seminaries in Denkendorf and Maulbronn and in the higher seminary in Tübingen. He graduated in 1770 and was appointed professor of philosophy at the &quot;Militär-Pflanzschule&quot; at the Solitude Palace which moved later to Stuttgart. While there, he was one of Schiller&#x27;s teachers and a good friend (becoming the dedicatee of his second play, &quot;Fiesco&quot;).

In 1790 he was appointed professor of philosophy and headmaster of the &quot;Contubernium&quot; in Tübingen; in 1792 he was a pedagogue of the Latin &quot;Schulen ob der Staig&quot;. Notably during this period, he adopted renowned German idealist Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel as his protege, according to Hegel&#x27;s sister. It is also known that Abel&#x27;s short book in defence of traditional rational metaphysics against Kant&#x27;s arguments, was one of the first pieces of literature on Kantianism to which Hegel was exposed. In 1811 Abel became prelate, general superintendent in Oehringen and member of the executive authority of the Evangelic Church in Württemberg. In 1823 von Abel became general superintendent in Bad Urach and Reutlingen, and lived in Stuttgart. He died on a leisure excursion in Schorndorf.

Jacob Friedrich von Abel was also a member of the Illuminatenorden, known as &quot;Pythagoras Abderites&quot;.

<text>The following is a list of countries and territories where English is an official language used in citizen interactions with government officials. , there are 57 sovereign states and 28 non-sovereign entities where English is an official language. Many administrative divisions have declared English an official language at the local or regional level.

Most states where English is an official language are former territories of the British Empire.
Exceptions include Rwanda and Burundi[also should be on map], which were formerly German and then Belgian colonies;
Cameroon, where only part of the country was under the British mandate;
and Liberia, the Philippines, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau, which were American territories.
English is the sole official language of the Commonwealth of Nations and of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). English is one of the official languages of the United Nations, the European Union, the African Union, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Caribbean Community, the Union of South American Nations, and many other international organisations. Although English is not &quot;de jure&quot; an official language at the national level in the United States, most states and territories within the United States have English as an official language, and only Puerto Rico uses a language other than English as a primary working language.
The United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, where the overwhelming majority of native English speakers reside, do not have English as an official language &quot;de jure&quot;, but English is considered their &quot;de facto&quot; official language because it dominates in these countries.

==Sovereign states==
=== English is a &quot;de jure&quot; official language ===


=== English is a predominant language without &quot;de jure&quot; designation as official ===
In these countries, English is conventionally spoken by both the government and main population, despite it having no &quot;de jure&quot; official status at national level. 

=== English is a &quot;de facto&quot; working language ===
In these countries, English is spoken in government or education, but it is not recognised as &quot;de jure&quot; official, nor a primary language spoken by the main population 


==Non-sovereign entities==
=== English is a &quot;de jure&quot; official language ===
=== English is a &quot;de facto&quot; official language ===

=== English is a &quot;de facto&quot; official, but not a primary language ===

==Country subdivisions==
In these country subdivisions, English has &quot;de jure&quot; official status, but English is not official in their respective countries at the national level.

<text>Domain knowledge is knowledge of a specific discipline or field in contrast to general (or domain-independent) knowledge. The term is often used in reference to a more general discipline—for example, in describing a software engineer who has general knowledge of computer programming as well as domain knowledge about developing programs for a particular industry. People with domain knowledge are often regarded as specialists or experts in their field.

==Knowledge capture==
In software engineering, &quot;domain knowledge&quot; is knowledge about the environment in which the target system operates, for example, software agents. Domain knowledge usually must be learned from software users in the domain (as domain specialists/experts), rather than from software developers. It may include user workflows, data pipelines, business policies, configurations and constraints and is crucial in the development of a software application. Expert domain knowledge (frequently informal and ill-structured) is transformed in computer programs and active data, for example in a set of rules in knowledge bases, by knowledge engineers.

Communicating between end-users and software developers is often difficult. They must find a common language to communicate in. Developing enough shared vocabulary to communicate can often take a while.

The same knowledge can be included in different domain knowledge. Knowledge which may be applicable across a number of domains is called &quot;domain-independent&quot; knowledge, for example logic and mathematics. Operations on domain knowledge are performed by metaknowledge.

<doc id="750102" wikidata="Q6596641" url="?curid=750102" title="List of Second World War Victoria Cross recipients">
<text>The Victoria Cross (VC) is a military decoration awarded for valour &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; to members of armed forces of some Commonwealth countries and previous British Empire territories. It takes precedence over all other Orders, decorations and medals; it may be awarded to a person of any rank in any service and to civilians under military command. The award was officially constituted when Queen Victoria issued a warrant under the Royal sign-manual on 29 January 1856 that was gazetted on 5 February 1856. The order was backdated to 1854 to recognise acts of valour during the Crimean War. The first awards ceremony was held on 26 June 1857, where Queen Victoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in a ceremony in Hyde Park.

The Victoria Cross was awarded 182 times to 181 recipients for action in the Second World War. The war, also known as World War II (WWII), was a global military conflict that involved a majority of the world&#x27;s nations, including all of the great powers, organised into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. The war involved the mobilisation of more than 100 million military personnel, making it the most widespread war in history. In a state of &quot;total war&quot;, the major participants placed their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities at the service of the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Throughout the six-year duration of the war, weapons and technology improved rapidly, including the use of jet aircraft, radar and nuclear weapons. More than 70 million people, the majority of whom were civilians, were killed, making it the deadliest conflict in human history.

The start of the war is generally held to be 1 September 1939, with the German invasion of Poland and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by most of the Crown Colonies of the British Empire and Commonwealth, and by France. The first Victoria Cross of the war was awarded to Gerard Roope for action whilst in command of HMS &quot;Glowworm&quot; (although not gazetted until 1945). The war at sea began immediately after war was declared with the Battle of the Atlantic, in which German U-boats attempted to disrupt and destroy allied convoys. Throughout the war the Royal Navy was tasked with guarding vital shipping lanes and enabling amphibious operations across the globe; the St Nazaire Raid saw five Victoria Crosses awarded. The Battle of the Mediterranean was fought throughout the war and included the Battle of Taranto and Battle of Matapan, as well as protecting convoys including the Malta convoys. In total, 23 servicemen from the Royal Navy were awarded the Victoria Cross including one Royal Marine. Aerial warfare came into its own in World War II with several distinct roles emerging. The role of fighter planes developed during the Battle of Britain, where the Royal Air Force fought for air superiority against the &quot;Luftwaffe.&quot; The Battle of Britain was the first major campaign to be fought entirely by air forces. It was the largest and most sustained bombing campaign until that date. Initially, RAF airfields were attacked, however as the battle progressed, operations were extended to the strategic level with The Blitz. Britain also conducted controversial strategic bombing campaigns in Europe and Asia; they involved hundreds of aircraft dropping tens of thousands of tons of munitions over a single city. Tactical strikes were also carried out by the RAF including Operation Chastise, where No. 617 Squadron RAF attacked German dams in the Ruhr valley using &quot;bouncing bombs&quot;; Guy Gibson was awarded the Victoria Cross for this action.

The war on the land did not begin until May 1940, as Britain and France were involved in a Phoney War between Germany and the Franco-British alliance. The phoney war ended with the Battle of France where Germany invaded Benelux and subsequently France, which forced British troops to escape from Dunkirk. In 1941, war spread to the Middle East and North Africa as well as the East African Campaign. The United States officially joined the war in December 1941 after the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1942, British forces under Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery defeated the Axis forces of General Erwin Rommel in the Second Battle of El Alamein, which marked a major turning point in the Western Desert campaign and the North African campaign. It ended Axis hopes of occupying Egypt, taking control of the Suez Canal, and gaining access to the Middle Eastern oil fields. Nine VCs were awarded for action in the Western Desert Campaign. By 1943, the war was being fought in several theatres, including the Pacific, North Africa and Southeast Asia. The Burma campaign of the Pacific War took place from 1942 to 1945, and saw 29 Victoria Crosses awarded. By 1944 and the Allied invasion of Normandy, the Allies were making ground in several theatres including advances in the Burma campaign. In Europe, the unsuccessful raid on Arnhem saw five soldiers awarded the Victoria Cross, four posthumously. In May 1945, the Allies accepted the unconditional surrender of German forces, celebrated with VE Day. Actions after VE Day until the war in the Pacific was ended with the surrender of Japan on board USS &quot;Missouri&quot; on 2 September 1945. saw seven Commonwealth servicemen awarded the VC.

Charles Upham received the Victoria Cross and Bar; two awards for two acts. Upham was only the third recipient of the Victoria Cross and Bar, and the first for combatant actions; the previous two recipients were medical officers of the Royal Army Medical Corps.

Of the 181 recipients 85 (46.96%) were awarded posthumously.

<doc id="750103" wikidata="Q728115" url="?curid=750103" title="Kirk McLean">
<text>Kirk Alan McLean (born June 26, 1966) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New Jersey Devils, Vancouver Canucks, Carolina Hurricanes, Florida Panthers and New York Rangers. He played in the style of a stand-up goaltender.

McLean played major junior hockey with the Oshawa Generals of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) and was drafted in the sixth round, 107th overall by the Devils in 1984. He played with the Devils&#x27; American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Maine Mariners, before being traded to the Canucks in 1987. He is best known for playing more than 10 seasons with the Canucks, during which time he was a finalist for two Vezina Trophies in 1989 and 1992, named to two NHL All-Star Games and received Second All-Star team honours. In 1994, he backstopped the Canucks to the seventh game of the Stanley Cup Finals against the Rangers. In 1998, he was traded away and spent the final three seasons of his career with the Hurricanes, Panthers and Rangers, before retiring in 2001.

Since retiring, McLean has been a goaltending coach for the Kamloops Blazers of the Western Hockey League (WHL), worked in broadcasting with the Canucks&#x27; pay-per-view telecasts and became a part-owner of the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL)&#x27;s Burnaby Express (now Coquitlam Express). He was involved in the restaurant business in Vancouver.
He now works for the Vancouver Canucks as the Ambassador and is a boardmember of the Canuck Alumni Foundation.

==Early life==
McLean was born in North York, Ontario, on June 26, 1966, and is of Scottish and smaller Irish descent, in which his mask had his family&#x27;s Scottish tartan on it. He grew up dreaming of playing for the Toronto Maple Leafs and looked up to NHL star Bernie Parent as a role model. Playing minor ice hockey in the Metro Toronto Hockey League (MTHL) with the Don Mills Flyers, he recorded a 2.01 goals against average (GAA) over 26 games in the 1982–83 season. He played in the 1979 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with Don Mills.

==Playing career==
===New Jersey Devils (1985–87)===
McLean played major junior in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) for three seasons with the Oshawa Generals. Following his rookie season with the Generals, he was drafted by the New Jersey Devils in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft with their sixth pick, 107th overall. He debuted with the Devils in 1985–86, appearing in two games after being called up from Oshawa on April 2, 1986. McLean had to compete with numerous other goaltenders in the Devils&#x27; system for ice time. Following the club&#x27;s 1987 training camp, he and Craig Billington were sent to their AHL affiliate, the Maine Mariners, while Karl Friesen and Chris Terreri were chosen to backup Alain Chevrier. Sean Burke was also in the Devils&#x27; system, although he was playing for the Canadian National Team at the beginning of the season.

McLean was called up from Maine on December 19, 1986, after Friesen was released and Terreri was sidelined with the flu. He arrived in New Jersey three hours before game-time against the Washington Capitals that day. He appeared in relief of Chevrier after the starter allowed three goals in the first 81 seconds. McLean allowed one goal on 24 shots for the rest of the game while earning the win in a 6–4 comeback victory. He appeared in four games during his call-up before being reassigned on January 6, 1987. After his return to the AHL, McLean suffered an injury, damaging cartilage in his right knee during a game on February 15. The injury required arthroscopic surgery. He finished the campaign in Maine with a 15–23–4 record and 3.22 GAA in 45 games. While training in the off-season, McLean injured his left knee and underwent his second arthroscopic surgery on July 29, 1987.

===Vancouver Canucks (1987–98)===
====Arrival to Stanley Cup run (1987–94)====
Leading up to the 1987–88 season, McLean was traded, along with Greg Adams and a second round choice (Leif Rohlin) in the 1988 NHL Entry Draft, to the Vancouver Canucks for centre Patrik Sundström and the Canucks&#x27; second- (Jeff Christian) and fourth-round draft picks (Matt Ruchty) in 1988, on September 15, 1987. The deal constituted the first major transactions by newly appointed Vancouver Canucks and New Jersey Devils general managers Pat Quinn and Lou Lamoriello, respectively. McLean&#x27;s acquisition was an integral part of Vancouver&#x27;s rebuilding process, led by Quinn. Within the next two years, McLean was joined in the Canucks organization by additional franchise cornerstones Trevor Linden and Pavel Bure. He became known to fans as &quot;Captain Kirk&quot;, in reference to the Star Trek protagonist.

McLean made 14 saves in his Canucks debut, recording an 8–2 win over the St. Louis Blues in the season opener on October 8, 1987. He notched his first NHL career shutout later that season on February 17, 1988, making 27 saves in a 5–0 win against the Pittsburgh Penguins. McLean split playing time with long-time Canucks starter Richard Brodeur in his first season in Vancouver, playing in 41 games with an 11–27–4 record, 3.71 GAA and .875 save percentage. He won his first of three Molson Cups with the Canucks at the end of the season, having earned the most three stars selections on the team.

McLean emerged the following season in 1988–89 with a winning 20–17–3 record, 3.08 GAA and .891 save percentage. Early in the season, he returned to New Jersey in a game against the Devils and recorded a shutout against his former team in a 4–0 Canucks win on October 20, 1988. He went on to receive his first Vezina Trophy nomination as the league&#x27;s best goaltender and finished third in voting, losing to Patrick Roy of the Montreal Canadiens. In 1989–90, McLean appeared in his first NHL All-Star Game in Pittsburgh and was the top goaltender at the Skills Competition by allowing the fewest goals against for the Breakaway Relay and Rapid Fire events. He led the league in games and minutes played with 63 and 3,738, respectively. McLean also set Canucks records with 1,797 shots against and 1,581 saves (both marks have since been surpassed). Backstopping the Canucks to 21 wins, 33 losses and 10 ties, he won his first Cyclone Taylor Trophy as Canucks MVP and second Molson Cup.

Early in the 1990–91 season, McLean re-signed with the Canucks to a one-year contract with a second year option on October 16, 1990. He was set to make $145,000 prior to re-organizing his contract for the season. McLean struggled in his fourth year with the Canucks, however, recording a career-worst 3.99 GAA with a 10–22–3 record in 41 games.

McLean bounced back the following season in 1991–92, starting the season with five consecutive wins to be named league player of the week for October 3 to 13, 1991. He set an NHL record for wins in October with nine (McLean&#x27;s mark was matched by the Toronto Maple Leafs&#x27; Felix Potvin and Philadelphia Flyers&#x27; Dominic Roussel in October 1993 and surpassed by the Detroit Red Wings&#x27; Manny Legace&#x27;s 10 wins in October 2005); he was named player of the month. Another season and historic highlight for McLean occurred at the Montreal Forum on December 4 when he stopped 45 shots in a 3–0 win, not only earning him his third shutout of the season but also the Canucks first shutout against the Montreal Canadiens in franchise history; the performance garnered a standing ovation from Canadiens&#x27; fans in attendance. McLean went on to lead the league with five shutouts (tied with the Chicago Blackhawks&#x27; Ed Belfour, the Canadiens&#x27; Patrick Roy and the Winnipeg Jets&#x27; Bob Essensa) and 38 wins in 65 games (tied with the Red Wings&#x27; Tim Cheveldae), as Vancouver won their first Smythe Division title since 1975. He appeared in his second All-Star Game, won his second Cyclone Taylor Trophy and was named to the second All-Star team. He earned his second Vezina Trophy nomination, finishing second in voting as Roy won the award once more. He recorded personal bests with a 2.74 GAA and 38 wins, the latter of which set a Canucks single-season goaltending record (the mark stood for 15 years before Roberto Luongo recorded 47 wins in 2006–07). In the subsequent 1992 playoffs, McLean recorded his first post-season shutout by stopping 33 shots in a 5–0 win against the Winnipeg Jets in game seven of the opening round. The win eliminated the Jets after the Canucks overcame a 3–1 series deficit.

McLean appeared in 54 games in 1992–93, posting a 28–21–3 record. He recorded three shutouts, which included back-to-back blankings in January 1993. Playing against the Los Angeles Kings in the second round of the 1993 playoffs, McLean recorded his 15th playoff win in a 7–2 Game 4 victory, establishing himself as the winningest playoff goaltender in Canucks history. The Canucks were, however, eliminated in six games by Los Angeles, the eventual Western Conference champions.

Towards the end of the 1993–94 season, McLean became a part of hockey history in a game against the Los Angeles Kings on March 23, 1994, by allowing Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s 802nd career NHL goal. The goal broke Gordie Howe&#x27;s record of 801, making Gretzky the all-time leading goal-scorer in NHL history. Despite allowing the historic goal, the Canucks won the game 6–3. McLean finished the season with a losing 23–26–3 record, as the Canucks finished with the seventh seed in the Western Conference.

McLean&#x27;s peak with the Canucks came during the subsequent 1994 Stanley Cup playoffs, when he backstopped them to the seventh game of the Stanley Cup Finals. Facing the Calgary Flames in the opening round, he made one of the most memorable plays in Canucks and NHL playoff history – a series saving stop on Flames forward Robert Reichel during the first overtime of the seventh game. Reichel had one-timed a pass from Theoren Fleury on a 3-on-1 when McLean threw out both his pads to make the stop and preserve the series. With McLean out of position and Reichel having had an open net to shoot at, the red light even came on at the Olympic Saddledome to signal a goal. The following overtime, Bure scored to eliminate the Flames and advance the Canucks to the second round.

Vancouver defeated the Dallas Stars the following round to advance to the semi-finals against the Toronto Maple Leafs. McLean posted back-to-back shutouts against the Leafs in the third and fourth games to tie the NHL playoff record of four shutouts in a single year (the New York Rangers&#x27; Mike Richter also recorded four that year; they became the seventh and eighth goaltenders to tie the record. Five more goaltenders went on to record four shutouts until the Red Wings&#x27; Dominik Hašek broke the record with six in 2002). He also became the first goaltender to record back-to-back shutouts in the semifinals since the Red Wings&#x27; Terry Sawchuk did so against the Maple Leafs in 1952. McLean&#x27;s shutout streak lasted a total of 143 minutes and 17 seconds.

The Canucks went on to capture the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl as Western Conference champions to meet the New York Rangers in the Finals. McLean opened the series with a 52-save performance, including 17 in overtime, to win the first game 3–2. It was the most saves by a Canucks goaltender in a playoff game until Luongo made 72 stops in 2007. Canucks head coach Pat Quinn commented after the game that McLean&#x27;s performance should be sent &quot;in an instructional package...to young goaltender[s].&quot; Although the Canucks managed to force a game seven after falling 3–1 in the series, they eventually lost the Stanley Cup to the Rangers by a 3–2 score in the final game. McLean finished the 1994 playoffs with a 15–9 record, a 2.29 GAA and .928 save percentage. His 1,544 minutes played, 820 shots against and 761 saves all set playoff records (they have since been surpassed).

====Post-lockout to trade (1994–97)====
The following lockout-shortened 1994–95 season, McLean appeared in 40 of the Canucks&#x27; 48 games and recorded all 18 wins for the team. Winning his third and final Molson Cup, he posted a career-high .904 save percentage along with a 2.75 GAA. Before the season ended, McLean signed a five-year contract extension that included the 1994–95 season, worth an approximate $2.4 million per season, on April 5, 1995. Vancouver failed to defend their Western Conference title of the previous year&#x27;s playoffs, however, as the Chicago Blackhawks swept them in the second round.

McLean&#x27;s play began to slip in 1995–96 as his GAA inflated to 3.54 and he recorded a losing 15–21–9 record. He was sidelined for six weeks during the season, beginning in January 1996, due to a cartilage tear in his left knee that required arthroscopic surgery. Rookie Corey Hirsch, who began the season as McLean&#x27;s backup, in comparison recorded a 2.93 GAA and a 17–14–6 record. McLean was chosen to start in the opening series against the top-seeded Colorado Avalanche, but was pulled in favour of Hirsch during Game 1 after allowing three goals on 12 shots. The game marked McLean&#x27;s final playoff appearance of his career as Hirsch played the remaining five games. The Avalanche eliminated Vancouver in six games and went on to win the Stanley Cup.

McLean reinjured his knee during the 1996–97 season during a game against the Dallas Stars on November 11, 1996. He missed approximately a month after undergoing his second arthroscopic surgery of the year in mid-November 1996. McLean and Hirsch continued to share starts in 1996–97, as McLean appeared in 44 games with a 21–18–3 record and 3.21 GAA.

===Post-Vancouver (1998–2001)===
McLean&#x27;s tenure with the Canucks ended during the season in 1997–98. Pat Quinn was dismissed as general manager early in the campaign and was replaced by a four-man committee of team executives. On the recommendation of newly hired head coach Mike Keenan, the management team dealt McLean to the Carolina Hurricanes on January 3, 1998. He was sent in a trade, along with winger Martin Gélinas, in exchange for goaltender Sean Burke, winger Geoff Sanderson and defenceman Enrico Ciccone.

After ten-and-a-half seasons in Vancouver, McLean left as the franchise&#x27;s all-time leader in regular season games played (516), wins (211) and shutouts (20), as well as playoff games played (68), wins (34) and shutouts (6). (Luongo surpassed McLean&#x27;s regular season shutouts total with his 21st on October 26, 2009.) McLean&#x27;s departure marked the beginning of an unstable period of time for Canucks goaltending. In the seven-and-a-half seasons between the time McLean was traded away and Luongo was acquired by the Canucks, a total of 18 goaltenders played for the club. General manager Brian Burke, who succeeded the four-man committee, coined the term &quot;goalie graveyard&quot; during his time in Vancouver to describe the club&#x27;s goaltending fortunes.

McLean entered his first game with the Hurricanes with the NHL&#x27;s worst GAA at 3.68, but helped his new club to a 4–1 win to record his first victory with Carolina. His tenure in Carolina was brief, as the Hurricanes traded him after eight appearances to the Florida Panthers for forward Ray Sheppard on March 24, 1998. He made his debut with the Panthers two days later on March 26 and recorded a 5–4 win against the Canadiens. The following season, McLean recorded his first shutout with the Panthers in a 1–0 win against the Nashville Predators. He went on to match his personal best 2.74 GAA in his first and only full season with the Panthers in 1998–99, playing in 30 games as Sean Burke&#x27;s backup.

The following off-season, he signed a two-year deal, worth an approximate $1.64 million with bonus incentives for games played, as an unrestricted free agent with the New York Rangers on July 13, 1999. McLean was brought in to replace Dan Cloutier, who had been traded away, as Mike Richter&#x27;s backup. McLean was forced to switch his number upon joining the club, as his customary number 1 was retired in honor of Ed Giacomin, he opted to wear number 30. McLean was thrust into the starter&#x27;s role in the first month of the 1999–2000 season, as Richter was sidelined with back problems early He made his Rangers debut in the season opener, making 25 saves in a 2–1 loss on October 5, 1999. He completed the season with a 2.89 GAA in 22 games. The following campaign in 2000–01, McLean&#x27;s GAA rose to 3.49 GAA in 23 games. After two seasons in New York and 17 seasons in the NHL overall, McLean retired in 2001.

==International play==
Over the course of his career, McLean represented Canada in international competition once. On March 28, 1990, McLean was among the players named to Canada&#x27;s roster for the 1990 World Championships in Bern and Fribourg, Switzerland. McLean was given the role of starting goaltender, with Ken Wregget serving as his backup. Canada won its first four-round robin games with McLean in net, including an 8–0 shutout victory versus Norway in which McLean split goaltending duties with Wregget, thus clinching a spot in the medal round. As the round robin continued, Canada added to their perfect record with a 5–3 victory over Czechoslovakia in which McLean stopped 25 of 28 shots for the victory. McLean started Canada&#x27;s next game, a 3–1 victory versus Sweden, but was replaced in the second period by third string goaltender Bob Essensa who had yet to play in the tournament. Following a 3–3 tie with the Soviet Union, Canada clinched first place in the round robin. The game was one of McLean&#x27;s best of the tournament, as he managed to keep the Soviet Union at bay during the third period in which they had a 14–2 margin in shots on goal.

After suffering a 3–2 loss versus Czechoslovakia in the opening game of the medal round, Canada opted to start Essensa versus the Soviet Union. Essensa let in four early goals before being replaced by McLean, who let in another three in a 7–1 loss to move Canada out of contention for the gold medal. In the final game of the tournament versus Sweden, Canada suffered a 6–4 loss and finished fourth overall for the tournament, missing out on their opportunity for a bronze medal that would have come with a win versus Sweden.

==Post-playing career==
Following McLean&#x27;s retirement, he was hired as a goaltending coach for the Kamloops Blazers of the WHL. He served in that capacity for one season, in 2002–03. McLean also returned to the Canucks organization as a broadcaster for the team&#x27;s pay-per-view telecasts.
McLean has also pursued the restaurant business in Vancouver, British Columbia. He co-owns McLean&#x27;s restaurant (opened June 24, 2010), the result of buying out other owners of So.cial at Le Magasin, a restaurant in the Gastown neighbourhood that opened in April 2007, with his former Canucks head coach, Bob McCammon. McLean is also a part-owner in the Coquitlam Express, a Junior A team in the BCHL. The ownership group includes several other former NHLers, including Darcy Rota, Bill Ranford and Dave Lowry.

From Sept 3, 2010, to May 14, 2013, McLean served as Colorado Avalanche&#x27;s goaltending consultant;. During the 2010–11 season, McLean was honoured by the Canucks in a ceremony prior to a game against the Avalanche on November 25, 2010. The organization made him the second inductee of the Canucks&#x27; Ring of Honour, commemorating the team&#x27;s best players of all-time with plaques circling the Rogers Arena stands.

McLean was named to BC&#x27;s Hockey Hall of Fame on Jan 22, 2014.

==Personal life==
Following his retirement, McLean moved back to Vancouver, where he joined the Canucks&#x27; alumni squad. The group is active in the local community, participating in fundraisers and working alongside Hockey Canada and BC Hockey for minor hockey associations. In September 2011, his off-ice efforts as a member of the Canucks&#x27; alumni were recognized and he was presented the Jake Milford Award.

McLean has pursued various interests besides hockey during and after his playing career. An avid golfer, he is part of the Marine Drive Golf Club in Vancouver and the Nicklaus North Golf Club in Whistler. He was also accepted into the Royal Portrush Golf Club in Northern Ireland in 2008. McLean began playing regularly at the age of 10.

Involved in thoroughbred horse racing, he co-owned Regal Discovery, a colt who won the 136th Queen&#x27;s Plate in 1995, with his wife Lesley and her parents Anne and Ron. McLean and Lesley have since divorced. He was also briefly married to Canadian journalist Jane MacDougall, a columnist for the National Post newspaper.

He is now married to ex-model and media account consultant Genevieve Duford, living together in Vancouver.

<text>Rustam Nurgaliyevich Minnikhanov (born 1 March 1957) is a Russian politician who has served as the head of Tatarstan, a federal subject of Russia, since 2010.

==Early life and education==
Rustam Minnikhanov was born on 1 March 1957, in a Volga Tatar family in the New Arysh village of Rybno-Slobodsky District in the Tatar ASSR.

He graduated from Kazan Agricultural Institute in 1978 as mechanical engineer and from Correspondence Institute of Soviet Trade as a commodity expert in 1986. He is a doctor of economic sciences.

== Career ==
After graduating from the institute in 1978, he began his career as an engineer in Sabinsky District Association of &quot;Selkhoztekhnika&quot;. He then worked in the district as a senior engineer and chief power engineer in a state timber industry enterprise and was deputy chairman of District Consumer Society Board.

From 1985 to 1993, he worked in Arsky District as chairman of the District Consumer Society Board, Chairman of the Executive Committee of People&#x27;s Deputies District Council, First Deputy Head of District Administration.

In 1993 he was appointed head of Vysokogorsky District administration.

===Minister of Finance (1996–1998)===
In November 1996 Minnikhanov was appointed minister of finance of the Republic of Tatarstan.

===Prime Minister of Tatarstan (1998–2010)===
From 10 July 1998 to 25 March 2010, Minnikhanov was prime minister of the Republic of Tatarstan.

As prime minister, he was known for his enthusiasm for technological innovation, spearheading the republic&#x27;s move to digital, paperless government and the streamlining of official business through the use of electronically distributed documents and electronic signing of official documents.

===President of Tatarstan (2010–2021)===
On 27 January 2010, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev nominated Minnikhanov to be the new president of Tatarstan and on 25 March 2010, Minnikhanov formally assumed the office of President. His ceremony was presented on Channel One Russia by Maxim Sharafutdinov.

===Head of Tatarstan (2021-present)===

In December 2021, Putin signed a law abolishing regional presidencies, and as such Minnikhanov&#x27;s title, despite protests from Tatarstan’s regional assembly and other cultural and political figures. 

====2014 welcome committee for Crimea====
During the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, Minnikhanov acted as a mediator between the Kremlin government and the Crimean Tatar community over concerns raised amongst Crimean Tatars over potential persecution by Russia should it annex the peninsula. On 5 March Minnikhanov signed an agreement on co-operation between Tatarstan and the Aksyonov government in Crimea that implied collaboration between ten government institutions as well as significant financial aid to Crimea from Tatarstan businesses. On 11 March Minnikhanov was in Crimea on his second visit and attended as a guest in the Crimean parliament chamber during the vote on the declaration of sovereignty pending 16 March referendum. The Tatarstan Mufti Kamil Samigullin invited Crimean Tatars to study in madrasas in Kazan, and declared support for their &quot;brothers in faith and blood&quot;.

Following news of Crimea&#x27;s independence referendum organized with the help of Russia on 16 March 2014, the Kurultai leadership voiced concerns of renewed persecution, as commented by a U.S. official before the visit of a UN human rights team to the peninsula. At the same time, Minnikhanov was dispatched to Crimea to quell Crimean Tatars&#x27; concerns and to state that &quot;in the 23 years of Ukraine&#x27;s independence the Ukrainian leaders have been using Crimean Tatars as pawns in their political games without doing them any tangible favors&quot;. The issue of Crimean Tatar persecution by Russia has since been raised regularly on an international level. On 18 March, the day Crimea was annexed by Russia, and Crimean Tatar was &quot;de jure&quot; declared one of the three official languages of Crimea. It was also announced that Crimean Tatars will be required to relinquish coastal lands on which they squatted since their return to Crimea in the early 1990s and be given land elsewhere in Crimea. Crimea stated it needed the relinquished land for &quot;social purposes&quot;, since part of this land is occupied by the Crimean Tatars without legal documents of ownership. The situation was caused by the inability of the USSR (and later Ukraine) to sell the land to Crimean Tatars at a reasonable price instead of giving back to the Tatars the land owned before deportation, once they or their descendants returned from Central Asia (mainly Uzbekistan). As a consequence, some Crimean Tatars settled as squatters, occupying land that was not legally registered.

====2017 Iranian envoy====
On 20 April 2017 Minnikhanov was Putin&#x27;s envoy to meet with candidate Ebrahim Raisi in Mashhad in Raisi&#x27;s capacity as Head of Astan Quds Razavi. MP Alireza Rahimi questioned the meeting and asked for explanations about the reasons for it, citing alleged Russian interference in 2016 U.S. election. “The recent meeting raises the suspicion of interference in the elections, which is not appropriate”, he said. According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency, Minnikhanov also met vice president Eshaq Jahangiri in Tehran one day earlier, discussing bilateral relations.

====Other presidential duties====
On 18 March 2022 Minnikhanov met and awarded 2022 European figure skating champion and provisional 2022 Olympic gold medallist Kamila Valieva a “Duslyk” order and to her mother Alsu Valieva a medal of “100 years of the Establishment of TASSR”.

==Corporate directorships==
During his tenure as republican prime minister, Minnikhanov continued to be involved in industry, serving as chairman of the board of directors of the oil company Tatneft from 2005 to 2006.

In September 2021 Minnikhanov while still President of Tatarstan was elected chairman of the board of directors of aircraft manufacturer Tupolev.

==Personal life==

Minnikhanov is married and fathered two sons. His son Irek Minnikhanov died in the Tatarstan Airlines Flight 363 crash on 17 November 2013.

Minnikhanov is a keen motorsports enthusiast and was a regular competitor in the FIA European Rallycross Championship, in 2007 driving a Citroën C4 T16 4x4 with 550+bhp that was built and raced in 2006 by 14-time European Rallycross champion Kenneth Hansen of Sweden. For the 2008 and 2009 ERX series Hansen&#x27;s team built a brand new C4 for Minnikhanov. In 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2006 Minnikhanov won the truck category of the UAE Desert Challenge (a Rally Raid competition) in the United Arab Emirates with his Kamaz 4911 and in 2004 as well as 2005 he finished 3rd overall in the FIA European Championship for Autocross Drivers with a four-wheel-driven Ford Puma.

Minnikhanov is certified to fly a helicopter.

=== Sanctions ===

In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury added Minnikhanov to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List on 26 January 2023, which results in his assets being frozen and U.S. persons being prohibited from dealing with him. Canada sanctioned Rustam Minnikhanov, together with his wife in April 2023.

<doc id="750105" wikidata="Q103985" url="?curid=750105" title="Arsk">
<text>Arsk (; ) is a town and the administrative center of Arsky District in Tatarstan, Russia, located on the Kazanka River, from the republic&#x27;s capital of Kazan. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 18,114.

==Etymology==
The Tatar name of the town () can be translated as &quot;Udmurt&#x27;s&quot; or &quot;Udmurtian&quot;.

==History==
It was founded at the end of the 14th century. It was the seat of Archa Darugha (a type of subdivision) during the Khanate of Kazan period. Even though the town was located in the area mostly populated by Tatars, the larger part of the &quot;darugha&quot;&#x27;s population was Udmurt. It is possible that earlier population of this area was also Finno-Ugric, who later assimilated with the Tatars.

Arsk was one of the strongest forts in the khanate. In 1506, it was the site of the Battles of Arsk Field, in which Tatar forces were defeated by the Russians but later turned the tables and won one of their most significant victories in the course of the Russo-Kazan Wars.

Arsk was captured by the Russian army under Prince Vorotynsky in 1552, the same year when Kazan itself was captured. In 1606, it was rebuilt as a Russian fortress. In 1708–1796, it was the seat of Arsky Uyezd. In 1781, it was granted town status. In 1918, it was taken in an anti-Bolshevik peasant rebellion. In 1920–1930, it was the administrative center of Arsky Kanton; when the &quot;kantons&quot; were abolished in 1930, it became the administrative center of the newly formed Arsky District. In 1938, it was demoted in status to that of an urban-type settlement. On June 27, 2008, it was granted town status again.
==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Arsk serves as the administrative center of Arsky District, to which it is directly subordinated. As a municipal division, the town of Arsk, together with five rural localities, is incorporated within Arsky Municipal District as Arsk Urban Settlement.

==Economy and transportation==
There are several light and food industry enterprises in the town, as well as a brick factory and a construction materials factory.

The town is a station on the Kazan–Agryz railway.

==Demographics==
Ethnically, the population is 83% Tatar and 15% Russian, with Mordvins, Mari, Chuvash, and Udmurts making up the remaining 2%.

==Namesakes==
The eastern part of Kazan, which had been situated out of the Arsk Gates of Kazan during Khanate&#x27;s epoch, was called Arsk Field. Later, this name spread to the cemetery, now situated in Central Kazan.

<text>Clan Keith is a Highland and Lowland Scottish clan, whose Chief historically held the hereditary title of Marischal, then Great Marischal, then Earl Marischal of Scotland.

==History==

===Origins of the Clan===

The placename Keith comes from a Cumbric form of the Modern Welsh &quot;coed&quot; (&quot;wood&quot;).

A warrior of the Chatti tribe is said to have killed the Danish General, Camus, at the Battle of Barrie in 1010. For this valour Malcolm II of Scotland dipped three fingers into the blood of the dead and drew them down the warrior&#x27;s shield. The warrior was thereafter named &quot;Marbhachair Chamuis&quot; which meant the &quot;Camus Slayer&quot;. The chief of the Clan Keith has borne the same three lines on his shield ever since. It can be found as early as 1316 on the seal of Sir Robert de Keith.

King Malcolm&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Carham in 1018 brought him into possession of Lothian, and the lands of Keith in Lothian were subsequently held by the Camus Slayer. It is from these lands that his progeny took their name.

A Norman adventurer named Hervey married the native heiress of &quot;Marbhachair&quot; and in about 1150 David I of Scotland granted her a charter for the lands of Keith. In a charter of 1176, their son was styled as &quot;Marischal of the King of Scots&quot;. The Marischal was charged with the safety of the king&#x27;s person within Parliament and was also custodian of the royal regalia.

===Wars of Scottish Independence===
In 1308, Robert the Bruce granted the royal Halforest of Aberdeenshire to his friend, Robert de Keith. Here the Marischal built his castle. His nephew was William Keith of Galston who returned Bruce&#x27;s heart to Melrose Abbey after the death of the Sir James Douglas at the Battle of Teba in Andalucia. Bruce confirmed to the family the hereditary office of marischal by a charter of 1324 and Sir Robert de Keith had commanded the Scottish cavalry at the Battle of Bannockburn. The office was held upon the condition that they bore the ancient arms that they had inherited from &quot;Marbhachair Chamuis&quot;.

Sir Robert Keith, the Marishchal, escorted the young David II of Scotland when he fled to France to escape the usurpation Edward Balliol.

===15th century and Clan conflicts===
The Clan Keith were often at feud with the neighbouring Clan Irvine and, in 1402, the Clan Irvine are said to have attacked and defeated an invading war party of the Clan Keith in what was known as the Battle of Drumoak.

Sir William Keith the Marischal who died in 1407 married the heiress of Sir Alexander Fraser and in doing so added great estates in Buchan, Kincardine and Lothian to his existing patrimony. William&#x27;s half-brother, John Keith, married the Cheyne heiress which brought the Keiths massive estates in Inverugie as well as Inverugie Castle, which later became the seat of the clan chiefs. Three of Sir William Keith&#x27;s children married children of Robert II of Scotland, while another daughter married Sir Adam Gordon, ancestor of the Earls of Huntly.

Circa 1458, the heir of the Marischal or Great Marischal was made 1st Earl Marischal and was the only peer to be styled by his office of state.

A branch of the Clan Keith who inhabited Caithness fought at the Battle of Tannach (probably 1464) where they assisted the Clan Mackay against the Clan Gunn. They later fought another battle against the Gunns, known as the Battle of Champions (probably 1478). This battle was fought between twelve men of the Clan Gunn and twenty four men of the Clan Keith. Most the Gunns, including the chief of the clan, were killed. However, Keith of Ackergill was soon after killed by the Gunns in a revenge attack. 

===16th and 17th centuries===

William Keith, 3rd Earl Marischal, along with the Earl of Glencairn invited John Knox the religious reformer back to Scotland in 1559. William Keith, 4th Earl Marischal, founded the Marischal College in Aberdeen. George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal, undertook the embassy to Denmark which resulted in the marriage of James VI of Scotland to Anne of Denmark.

A clansmen, William Keith of Delny (died 1599), was a Scottish courtier and Master of the Royal Wardrobe. He also served as ambassador for James VI to various countries. He was an important intermediary between George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal and the king, the king and courtiers, and the king and foreign governments.

After Charles II of England was crowned in 1651, William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal, was captured and imprisoned in the Tower of London. He remained there until the Restoration when the king appointed him a Privy Councillor and later Lord Privy Seal as recompense for what he and his family had suffered in the royal cause. After Charles&#x27;s coronation the Scottish crown jewels had been hidden on the Keith lands and as a result Marischal&#x27;s brother, John Keith, was created Knight Marischal and Earl of Kintore.

===18th century and Jacobite Risings===
George Keith, 8th Earl Marischal, was appointed a Knight of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle by James Francis Edward Stuart (the &quot;Old Pretender&quot;). During the Jacobite rising of 1715, the Clan Keith supported the Jacobite cause. As a result, George Keith, 10th Earl Marischal, along with his brother, James Francis Edward Keith, forfeited their lands, castles and titles. However the two Keith brothers played a part in Continental affairs during the 18th century with the earl being one of the very few Jacobite Knights of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. He also received the highest order in Prussia, the Order of the Black Eagle, while his brother was given Russia&#x27;s Order of St. Andrew the Apostle the First-Called.

In 1801, the Right Honourable the Lord Lyon King of Arms recognised Keith of Ravelston and Dunnotter as representer of the Marischal Keiths and his nephew was dubbed Knight Marischal in 1822 for George IV&#x27;s visit to Edinburgh that year.

Algernon Hawkins Thomond Keith-Falconer, 9th Earl of Kintore and 9th Lord Keith Inverurie and Keith Hall, was flamboyant and decimated the Kintore estates. However, Sir James Ian Baird of Urie then Keith of Urie, 12th Earl of Kintore, 12th Lord Keith of Inverurie and Keith Hall, 2nd Viscount Stonehaven, 2nd Baron Stonehaven and 3rd Baronet, promoted the clan internationally and appointed a Seanchaí to preserve their history and traditions.

In 1978, the Chief of Clan Keith and the Commander of Clan Gunn signed a peace treaty at the site of the Chapel of St. Tayrs, ending the feud between the two clans which began in 1478.

In 2002, the 13th Earl of Kintore, who was the previous Chief of Clan Keith, entered into a peace treaty the previous Chief of Clan Irvine, with at an elaborate ceremony on the banks of the River Dee to end their 600-year feud.

==Chief==
The current Chief of Clan Keith is Sir James William Falconer Keith of Urie, 14th Earl of Kintore, 14th Lord Keith of Inverurie and Keith Hall, 4th Viscount Stonehaven, 4th Baron Stonehaven, 5th Baronet, 6th of Ury (b. 15 April 1976).

==Clan Tartan, Crest &amp; Motto==

The Keith clan tartan is registered with the Scottish Register of Tartans with a date of 1 January 1838. The Scottish Tartans Authority (STA) and Scottish Tartans World Register (STWR) reference numbers are both 253. The designer is not specified and the tartan was registered prior to the establishment of the Scottish Register of Tartans (SRT).

Registration notes:
Jack Dalgety notes of June 1963 state: &#x27;This sett is the same as Falconer, Austin and Marshall and derives from Lord Falconer who took over the entailed lands of the Keith, Earl Marischal in the early 1800&#x27;s. There is a family Keith-Falconer who wear this tartan&#x27; The earliest known date from a list compiled by D.C. Stewart from Wilsons of Bannockburn letters is 1838. Also recorded in Wilson&#x27;s of Bannockburn, 1819 pattern book as No. 75 or Austin. D.W. Stewart writes in &#x27;Old and Rare..&#x27;in 1893, &quot;that it is included in every early collection.&quot; The Keiths were a powerful Celtic family, who held the hereditary office of Great Marischal of Scotland. They are associated with Dunottar Castle, near Stonehaven&#x27;. Wilsons of Bannockburn a weaving firm founded c1770 near Stirling. The Pattern books are in the National Museum of Antiquities, Edinburgh. Copys of the Pattern books and letters in the Scottish Tartans Society archive
===The Clan Crest and motto===

The clan crest is a roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) also known as the roe, western roe deer or European roe, is a species of deer. The male of the species is sometimes referred to as a roebuck. The Keith Clan Motto: Veritas Vincit is translated as Truth Conquers.

==Castles==
* Keith Marischal House, three miles south of Pencaitland, East Lothian, is an L-plan tower house that dates from the sixteenth century. It is on the site of an earlier castle that was built by the Keiths from the fourteenth century.
* Dunnottar Castle stands on a cliff-girt promontory above the sea a couple of miles south of Stonehaven, Kincardineshire. There has been a strong-hold there since the twelfth century, although it was held by the Keiths from 1382 after they exchanged their property of Struthers with the Clan Lindsay for Dunnottar. The present ruins at Dunnottar include a tower, courtyard, chapel and the entrance to the castle that is up a steep ascent through a tunnel. Donald, King of Scots was killed there in 900 and William Wallace captured the castle from the English in 1297. Mary, Queen of Scots stayed at the castle in 1562 and James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose unsuccessfully laid siege to the castle in 1645. William Keith, 9th Earl Marischal entertained Charles II of England at the castle in 1650 and the Scottish regalia was kept there when Oliver Cromwell invaded in 1651. Cromwell besieged the castle in 1652 and it only capitulated after eight months by starvation and mutiny. The castle garrison had then been commanded by Sir Robert Keith, fourth son of the 6th Earl Marischal. The castle was held for William of Orange in 1689 and many Jacobites were imprisoned in it. The Duke of Argyll partly slighted the castle after George Keith, 10th Earl Marischal had supported the Jacobite rising of 1715.
* Keith Hall in Aberdeenshire, once known as Caskieben, is the current seat of the chief of Clan Keith. It is a Z-plan tower house dating from the sixteenth century.
* Fetteresso Castle passed from the Clan Strachan to the Clan Keith chief, Earl Marischal during the early 14th century.
* Ackergill Tower, a couple of miles north of Wick, Caithness is a tower and mansion that dates from the fifteenth century. It rises to five storeys and was originally held by the Cheynes but passed to the Keith Earls Marischal in about 1350. The Keiths who inhabited Caithness had a long and bitter feud with the Clan Gunn. In 1556 the Keiths were besieged in the castle by the Clan Sinclair before eventually selling it to them in 1612. Sir Robert Keith of Benholm had also once attacked the castle during a family dispute.
* Clackriach Castle, a sixteenth century tower house near Maud in Aberdeenshire.

<text>James Frederick Bryan Wood (April 27, 1813 – June 20, 1883) was an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He was the fifth Bishop and first Archbishop of Philadelphia, serving between 1860 and his death in 1883.

==Early life==
James Wood was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents were both from England, his father (a merchant) from Manchester and his mother from Gloucestershire; they immigrated to the United States in 1809. His father had him baptized by a Unitarian minister.

After attending an elementary school on Dock Street, he was sent abroad to the Crypt School at Gloucester in November 1821. He returned to Philadelphia five years later and then enrolled at a private school on Market Street. In November 1827, he and his family removed to Cincinnati, Ohio, where the young Wood became a clerk at the Branch Bank of the United States. After being advanced to individual book-keeper and discount clerk, he was made a paying and receiving teller (1833) and cashier (1836) in the Franklin Bank of Cincinnati.

===Conversion and ordination===
Wood also developed a friendship with Bishop John Baptist Purcell, who later baptized him into the Catholic Church on April 7, 1836. Deciding to enter the priesthood, he resigned as cashier at Franklin Bank in September 1837 and went to Rome for his studies the following October. After spending a few months at the Pontifical Irish College under Paul Cullen (later Paul Cardinal Cullen), he studied at the College of the Propaganda for seven years, also becoming prefect of discipline there. Wood was ordained a priest by Cardinal Giacomo Filippo Fransoni on March 25, 1844. Upon his return to the Diocese of Cincinnati in October 1844, he served as a curate at the Cathedral of St. Peter in Chains until 1854, when he became pastor of St. Patrick&#x27;s Church in Cincinnati.

==Episcopal ministry==

===Coadjutor Bishop of Philadelphia===
On January 9, 1857, Wood was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Philadelphia and Titular Bishop of &quot;Antigonea&quot; by Pope Pius IX. He received his episcopal consecration on the following April 26 from Archbishop Purcell, with Bishops John Neumann, C.SS.R. (later a Saint), and Richard Vincent Whelan serving as co-consecrators. After arriving in Philadelphia, he took charge of the financial affairs of the diocese and established the cathedral parish.

===Fifth Bishop of Philadelphia===
Wood later succeeded Neumann as the fifth Bishop of Philadelphia upon the latter&#x27;s death on January 5, 1860. At the time of his succession, the diocese (which included the entire states of Pennsylvania and Delaware in addition to western New Jersey) included 200,000 Catholics, 137 priests, 131 parishes, 17 chapels and missions, 40 parish schools with 8,710 pupils, four colleges and four academies. The erection of the Cathedral of Sts. Peter and Paul came to a brief halt with the outbreak of the Civil War, but was later dedicated by Wood on November 20, 1864. In 1865 he purchased a large tract of land in Overbrook, on the outskirts of Philadelphia, for the new St. Charles Borromeo Seminary, the cornerstone of which was laid on April 4, 1866. The seminary was opened in September 1871 with 128 students. He was named an Assistant at the Pontifical Throne in 1862.

Wood established the Catholic Home for Destitute Orphan Girls, enlarged St. Vincent&#x27;s Home and founded a convent for the Sisters of the Good Shepherd. He also introduced into the diocese the Little Sisters of the Poor, Servant Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, and Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus. He also determined that those Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia based in Syracuse, New York should establish a separate daughter congregation. He condemned such secret societies as the Freemasons and Molly Maguires.

In 1868 the Dioceses of Harrisburg, Scranton and Wilmington were established, leaving Philadelphia with 93 churches and 157 priests. Wood attended the First Vatican Council, where he supported the definition of papal infallibility, but was forced to leave early in March 1870 due to poor health. He was also named Treasurer of the Board for the Pontifical North American College.

===Metropolitan Archbishop===
On February 12, 1875, the Diocese of Philadelphia was elevated to the rank of an archdiocese, with Wood becoming its first Metropolitan Archbishop. He was invested with the pallium by Archbishop James Roosevelt Bayley on the following June 17. He traveled to Rome in 1877 to assist at the celebration of the golden jubilee of Pius IX&#x27;s episcopate, but returned home after suffering from a severe attack of rheumatism. He also suffered from Bright&#x27;s disease. Since the division of the diocese in 1868, Wood increased the number of churches to 127 and of chapels to 53 chapels, and founded 25 new parochial schools. By 1883, there were also 31 missions, 260 priests, 99 seminarians between St. Charles Seminary and the North American College, three colleges, 22,000 students in parochial schools, six orphanages, four hospitals, two homes for the elderly and over 300,000 Catholics.

Wood later died in Philadelphia, aged 70. He is buried in the crypt beneath Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral. Archbishop Wood Catholic High School in Warminster is named in his honor.

In 2014, St. Charles Borromeo Seminary decided to sell an 1877 portrait of Archbishop Wood painted by Thomas Eakins. Although Eakins was not Catholic, he and his friend, Samuel Murray, would bicycle on Sundays to the seminary to attend vespers. Eakins took advantage of the brilliant vestments to animate the composition in a way not possible in his other male portraits. Proceeds from the sale will go toward the costs of renovations at the seminary.

<text>John Stephens Wood (February 8, 1885 – September 12, 1968) was an American attorney and politician from the state of Georgia, United States. He served as a Democrat in the United States House of Representatives, 1931–1935 and 1945–1953.

==Early life, education and career==
Wood was born on a farm near Ball Ground, Cherokee County, Georgia, February 8, 1885. He attended the public schools and graduated from North Georgia Agricultural College in Dahlonega. He earned his law degree from Mercer University in Macon in 1910. He was admitted to the bar the same year and commenced the practice of law in Jasper, Georgia, the county seat of Pickens County.

==Career==
In 1915, Wood turned up at the scene of the lynching of Leo Frank, Jewish factory owner in Atlanta, with Judge Newt Morris on the morning after the murder. He drove the vehicle in which Frank&#x27;s body was conveyed to the undertaker. Whether he had any prior knowledge of or involvement with the lynching is open to dispute, as he and Morris may have been simply trying to ensure Frank&#x27;s body had a decent burial.

Entering politics, Wood was a member of the Georgia House of Representatives in 1917; served as Solicitor General of the Blue Ridge Judicial Circuit, 1921–1925. He was elected as a Superior Court Judge, Blue Ridge Judicial Circuit, 1925–1931.

In 1931, Wood was elected as a Democrat from Georgia&#x27;s 9th congressional district to the 72nd United States Congress and was reelected to the 73rd Congress (March 4, 1931 – January 3, 1935). He was unsuccessful in seeking renomination in 1934 and resumed the practice of law.

Ten years later, in 1944, Wood was elected to the 79th United States Congress serving until the 82nd Congress (January 3, 1945 – January 3, 1953). As chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee, he had a prominent role in investigating the American Communist Party and the entertainment industry; the committee charged 10 persons with contempt of Congress for refusing to testify, and their careers and reputations were severely damaged in what was called the Hollywood Blacklist.

Wood was criticized for failing to investigate the Ku Klux Klan in the same period, as it was expanding in chapters in opposition to civil rights activism by African-Americans.

==Later years==
Wood did not seek reelection in 1952 and he resumed the practice of law in Canton, Georgia. Finally, failing health forced his retirement. Wood died in Marietta, Georgia, September 12, 1968, and was interred in Arlington Memorial Park, Sandy Springs, Georgia.

<text>Robert Coldwell Wood (September 16, 1923 – April 1, 2005) was an American political scientist, academic and government administrator, and professor of political science at MIT. From 1965 to 1969, Wood served as the Under Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development under President Lyndon B. Johnson, and for two weeks as the Secretary at the end of the Johnson Administration.

After his return to MIT, he directed the Joint Center for Urban Studies at MIT and Harvard. He also had a joint appointment as chairman of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. He served as president of the University of Massachusetts (1970-1977), overseeing expansion of programs, including construction of a campus in south Boston.

== Early life and career ==

Wood was born on September 16, 1923, in St Louis, Missouri, the son of Mary (née Bradshaw) Wood and Thomas Frank Wood. He won a scholarship to Princeton University, interrupting his studies during World War II to serve in the U.S. Army. Wood saw action during Battle of the Bulge, won a Bronze Star, and rose to the rank of sergeant.

After graduating from Princeton University, Wood earned three degrees from Harvard University: a master&#x27;s in public administration, and a master&#x27;s and a doctorate in government.

Wood taught political science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1959 to 1965. From 1965 to 1969, Wood served as the Under Secretary of the newly created Department of Housing and Urban Development under President Lyndon B. Johnson.

In 1968, Wood was awarded the Wiener Medal for Cybernetics from the American Society for Cybernetics. Following the resignation of Robert C. Weaver as Secretary of HUD, Wood served briefly in the position for two weeks before George Romney took office.

Wood returned to MIT, where he directed the Joint Center for Urban Studies at MIT and Harvard. At the same time, he was appointed as head of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).

From 1970 to 1977, he served as president of the University of Massachusetts. During these years, Wood led the expansion of the university, to include UMass Medical Center in Worcester and its Boston campus. He also played a key role in bringing the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum to its site at Columbia Point, next to UMass-Boston. He also taught at Wesleyan University.

In 1978, Wood was chosen to serve as superintendent of Boston Public Schools. It was the first time since Franklin B. Dyer&#x27;s hiring in 1912 that someone outside of Boston Public Schools was given the job of superintendent. He took over the district while it was in the midst of the busing crisis—a period in which the district was under a federal court order to desegregate. In 1980, the school committee voted to remove Wood from office, with anti-busing members John J. McDonough, Elvira &quot;Pixie&quot; Palladino, and Gerald O&#x27;Leary voting for his ouster and John D. O&#x27;Bryant and Jean Sullivan McKeigue opposing.

== Personal life ==
Wood married the former Margaret Byers, on March 22, 1952. They had three children, including the actor Frank Wood and the Governor of New Hampshire and U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan. Wood died from stomach cancer at his home in Boston, on April 1, 2005, aged 81.

<doc id="750154" wikidata="Q917796" url="?curid=750154" title="Osoyoos">
<text>Osoyoos (, ) is the southernmost town in the Okanagan Valley in British Columbia between Penticton and Omak. The town is north of the United States border in the Washington State and is adjacent to the Osoyoos Indian reserve. The origin of the name Osoyoos was the word &quot;sw̓iw̓s&quot; (pronounced &quot;soo-yoos&quot;) meaning &quot;narrowing of the waters&quot; in the local Okanagan language (&quot;Syilx&#x27;tsn&quot;). The &quot;O-&quot; prefix is not indigenous in origin and was attached by settler-promoters wanting to harmonize the name with other place names beginning with O in the Okanagan region (Oliver, Omak, Oroville, Okanogan). There was a local newspaper, the &quot;Osoyoos Times,&quot; but merged with the Oliver Chronicle and became the Times Chronicle in May 2020.

The town&#x27;s population of 5,556 (2021) swells in the summer months with seasonal visitors. Seniors (age 65 and over) comprise 43% of the town population. Another 2,139 people live around the town within Electoral Area A of the Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen, and 1,426 more in the Osoyoos 1 Indian Reserve.

==History==
The first Europeans to visit Osoyoos were fur traders working for the Pacific Fur Company, an American enterprise. They ventured up the Okanagan River to Osoyoos Lake and farther north. After the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company took over the fur trade in 1821, the Okanagan Valley became a major trade route for supplies to inland forts of British Columbia and furs that were shipped south to the Columbia River and the Pacific to European and Asian markets. The final Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company brigade in 1860 was the end of an era, as gold rushes transformed the economy of the new Colony of British Columbia. As parties of miners headed for the Fraser goldfields via the Okanagan Trail, they commonly met conflict with the Okanagan people. The Dewdney Trail passed through Osoyoos on its way from Hope to the Kootenays. The trail now forms the backbone of the Crowsnest Highway.

Thousands of miners heading to the goldfields and drovers with large herds of livestock crossed the 49th parallel after 1858. A customs house was built in Osoyoos in 1861 with John Carmichael Haynes as the tax collector. Haynes was also the first pioneer settler who obtained land along the Okanagan River north of Osoyoos that had been part of the Osoyoos Indian Reserve established by the Joint Indian Reserve Commission in 1877. These lands, now known as the Haynes Lease lands, remain as an original house and barn.

Osoyoos was incorporated as a village in 1946 when the railway arrived and became a town in the 1980s. When the railway was discontinued, its station house was purchased from the Town of Osoyoos and moved 300 m north to its current location by the Osoyoos Sailing Club.

==Geography==
Osoyoos is situated on the east-west Crowsnest Highway (Highway 3) with a significant ascent out of the Okanagan Valley in either direction. The Crowsnest headed east begins with an switchback up the flank of the Okanagan Highland with a rise to the mining and ranching region of Anarchist Mountain, which is part of the Boundary Country (the stretch of rising highway is also referred to as Anarchist Mountain). Highway 3 westbound leads to Keremeos and the Similkameen Valley via Richter Pass. On Highway 97 south is a 24-hour border crossing between Canada and the United States between Osoyoos and Oroville, Washington. The Canada–United States border is located south of the Highway 3 and 97 intersection on the northwest side of town.

The town is situated on Osoyoos Lake, which has a perimeter of , an elevation of , a maximum depth of , and a mean depth of . The lake&#x27;s elevation marks the lowest point in Canada of the Okanagan Valley.

=== Ecology ===
The far southern reaches of the Okanagan and Similkameen Valleys are part of a threatened xeric shrubland ecosystem in Canada known as the Columbia Plateau ecoregion. Specifically, the ecosystem of the area is named after the antelope brush plant typical of the local climate. This ecosystem was once more prevalent in the South Okanagan but is now becoming fragmented and degraded due to the spread of agriculture, urban development, and other human activities.

Since 2003, a feasibility study by Parks Canada has been going on to determine the need for protection of a large area of grasslands west of the town known as the South Okanagan-Lower Similkameen National Park Reserve Feasibility Study.

===Climate===

The climate, according to the Köppen climate classification, is a cold semi-arid (&quot;&quot;BSk&quot;&quot;) with summers that are generally hot and dry. Although it claims to be a desert, Osoyoos is actually about too wet to be an actual desert. The average daytime temperature in Osoyoos is , which is the warmest in Canada. Osoyoos also has an average annual temperature of , which is one of the warmest in the country.

September and October are usually dry and sunny with cool mornings.

==Agriculture==

Although the fruit-growing possibilities were noticed by early settlers, the first commercial orchard in the area was not established until 1907, growing cherries, apricots, nectarines, peaches, plums, pears and apples. Osoyoos Orchard Limited was formed in 1920 and an irrigation project was planned which finally brought water to the west bench via &quot;The Ditch&quot; in 1927. The former shrub-steppe environment was transformed into a lush agricultural belt and Osoyoos promoted &quot;the earliest fruit in Canada&quot;.

Today, the area continues to produce tree fruits. Aside from tourism, agriculture is a major component of the local economy, as is evident by the abundant produce stands along Highways 3 and 97, and the numerous commercial orchards surrounding the town. With the growing popularity of viticulture, some of these orchards are being converted to vineyards, as the area is a major wine-producing region of Canada. After clearing of mainly sagebrush, parcels of bench land have been replanted for viticulture.

The vast majority of the land in the valley bottom surrounding the town is protected by the Agricultural Land Reserve which prevents valuable agricultural lands from being converted into other uses.

==Tourism==
 Tourism in the Osoyoos area has become a large contributor to the local economy. This tourism is brought on by the many amenities in the Osoyoos area.

Osoyoos Lake is &quot;the warmest freshwater lake in Canada&quot; according to the town of Osoyoos and the BC Parks System, with reported average summer water temperatures of 24 °C (75 °F). The lake is surrounded by kilometres of beaches (public and private), parks and picnic grounds, such as Gyro Beach, Lions Centennial Park, Kinsmen Park, Legion Beach and Sẁiẁs Provincial Park. There are also major plans to revitalize the waterfront along the town core, spurred on by recent major developments such as the Watermark Beach Resort which include increased public space and an expanded marina.

Spotted Lake is a saline endorheic alkali lake located northwest of Osoyoos.

There are two centres dedicated to preserving the ecosystem of the Okanagan Desert. The Osoyoos Desert Centre is located north of Osoyoos off Highway 97, while the Nk&#x27;Mip Desert Cultural Centre is located adjacent to the Nk&#x27;mip Winery on the Osoyoos Indian Reserve.

The area is served by four championship golf courses – Osoyoos Golf Club which boasts two distinct eighteen-hole courses, the Park Meadows Golf Course and the Desert Gold Golf Course, Fairview Mountain Golf Club (Oliver) and the Nk&#x27;Mip Canyon Desert Golf Course (Oliver) – and one nine-hole course, Sonora Dunes (Osoyoos).

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Osoyoos had a population of 5,556 living in 2,647 of its 3,279 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 5,050. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The town&#x27;s popularity among retirees is reflected in the age of the average resident at 55.4 years (2016) compared to 40.8 years for the rest of the population of British Columbia. The average age of the Osoyoos senior population is second in Canada only to Qualicum Beach, BC (60.1 years).

The town is served by a high school, Osoyoos Secondary School.

<doc id="750157" wikidata="Q2458911" url="?curid=750157" title="Wycliffe (TV series)">
<text>Wycliffe is a British television series based on W. J. Burley&#x27;s novels about Detective Superintendent Charles Wycliffe. It was produced by HTV and broadcast on the ITV Network, after a pilot episode on 7 August 1993, between 24 July 1994 and 5 July 1998. The series was filmed in Cornwall, with a production office in Truro. Music for the series was composed by Nigel Hess, who was nominated for the Royal Television Society award for the best original television theme in 1997. Charles Wycliffe, played by Jack Shepherd, is assisted by DI Doug Kersey (Jimmy Yuill) and DI Lucy Lane (Helen Masters).

Each episode deals with a murder investigation. In the early series, stories were adapted from Burley&#x27;s books and were in classic whodunit style, often with quirky characters and plot elements. In later seasons, the tone became more naturalistic, and there was more emphasis on internal politics within the police force.

==Setting and characters==
The setting in Cornwall is an important feature of the series, providing both picturesque landscapes and glimpses into the local way of life. Some characters work in the tourist industry. Some of the problems of the county, such as the struggling fishing industry, long-term unemployment, and prejudice against new age travellers, are shown in various episodes. Wycliffe and his team are responsible for a large geographical area and often have to spend time away from home during an investigation. This can cause problems for Wycliffe, who is shown as a contented family man married to a teacher (Lynn Farleigh) and with two teenage children. It also makes it difficult for Lane and Kersey, who are both single, to form relationships outside work.

Wycliffe&#x27;s beat appears to cover mainly central and west Cornwall. There are frequent references to certain major towns, including Truro, Newquay, Camborne and Penzance (these places were also used as filming locations). Other towns in the same area, such as Falmouth, St Austell or St Ives, figure less frequently, although Falmouth probably provided some of the backgrounds to scenes in &quot;Time Out&quot;, the only episode for which a fictional Cornish town (&quot;Carrick&quot;) was invented, complete with a red-light district, called Eastgate. Bodmin (actually mainly Bodmin Moor) features strongly in one episode, &quot;Number of the Beast&quot;, which is about the so-called Beast of Bodmin (said to be a big cat). In the final episode, &quot;Land&#x27;s End&quot;, Wycliffe refers to Wadebridge, near Bodmin, as being on &quot;the other side of the county&quot;.

Devon and Cornwall Police is no longer organised into divisions. The Major Crime Investigation Team in Cornwall, which would presumably be headed by Wycliffe, was actually based at Newquay during the period in which the series was made, but Wycliffe&#x27;s divisional headquarters appears to be in the Camborne area.

==Cast==
*Jack Shepherd as Detective Superintendent Charles Wycliffe
*Jimmy Yuill as DI Doug Kersey 
*Helen Masters as DI Lucy Lane 
*Lynn Farleigh as Helen Wycliffe 
*Tim Wylton as Dr. Franks 
*Aaron Harris as DS Dixon (Series 1–3)
*Adam Barker as DC Potter (Series 1–3)
*Michael Attwell as Deputy Chief Constable Stevens (series 4–5)

==List of episodes==

Wycliffe ran for five series from 24 July 1994 to 5 July 1998, and included a pilot episode (originally shown on 7 August 1993) and a Christmas special shown between the fourth and fifth series.

Notes:&lt;br&gt;
† includes the pilot episode originally aired on 7 August 1993.
‡ includes the Christmas special originally aired on 27 December 1997.

===Series 1 (1993-94)===

The first series of &quot;Wycliffe&quot; was originally aired on the ITV network in the summer of 1994.

The pilot episode was originally aired one year earlier than the commissioned first series, in the summer of 1993. The cast of the pilot differs from that used for the commissioned series; Jack Shepherd plays Wycliffe both in the pilot and in the commissioned series.

===Series 2 (1995)===

The second series of &quot;Wycliffe&quot; was originally aired on the ITV network in the summer of 1995.
===Series 3 (1996)===

The third series of &quot;Wycliffe&quot; was originally aired on the ITV network in the summer of 1996. There was a short hiatus in the third series due to ITV&#x27;s coverage of the Euro &#x27;96 football tournament.
===Series 4 (1997)===

The fourth series of &quot;Wycliffe&quot; was originally aired on the ITV network in the summer of 1997.
===Series 5 (1997-98)===

The final series of &quot;Wycliffe&quot; was originally aired on the ITV network in the summer of 1998. The Christmas special was originally aired about five months earlier in December 1997.

The fifth and final series saw Jack Shepherd directing two episodes: &quot;On Offer&quot;; and &quot;Standing Stone&quot;. During the filming of this series Jimmy Yuill fell ill with meningitis. While he was in hospital the production company, HTV, terminated his contract. Though he made a full recovery HTV then refused to allow him to return to the programme, apparently for insurance reasons. This caused considerable ill-feeling and Jack Shepherd made it clear that he did not wish to continue as Wycliffe. ITV did not recommission the programme.

Notes:
† Christmas Special.

==Home media==

All five series were released individually on DVD in the UK by Network between 27 July 2009, and 21 February 2011.

All five series were released individually on DVD in Australia through Time Life, distributed by Shock Entertainment. The Complete Collection DVD containing five individual seasons in a slip box was released first, followed later in the same year by a new collection slimmed down to a single case with new artwork. In 2014 ITV released &quot;The Complete Collection&quot; in a single case.

<text>Kafr El Dawwar ( ) is a major industrial city and municipality on the Nile Delta in the Beheira Governorate of northern Egypt. Located approximately 30 km from Alexandria, the municipality has a population of about 265,300 inhabitants and comprises a number of smaller towns and villages.

==History==
Kafr El Dawwar was the location of the famous Battle of Kafr El Dawwar between the Egyptian army, headed by Ahmed Orabi, and the British army, during the Anglo-Egyptian War of 1882. For five weeks, Orabi was able to stop British forces from advancing toward the Egyptian capital of Cairo. Egyptian victory in the battle compelled the British to change their strategy, with British forces shifting to the Suez Canal to reach Cairo through Tel El Kebir.

In the early months of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, Kafr El Dawwar was the scene of industrial action that resulted in death sentences for two leaders of the strike.

In September 1984, protests broke out in Kafr El Dawwar over efforts by Hosni Mubarak, Egypt&#x27;s President, to raise food prices during a period of wage decreases. Thousands of demonstrators threw rocks, and occupied markets and roads. In response, security forces fired rubber bullets and tear gas, killing three persons at a milling plant, and injuring dozens more. Rioting spread to other centres, including the Misr Spinning and Weaving Company in El-Mahalla.

In the vicinity of the Kafr El Dawwar are a great number of ancient cemeteries (including Kom Ishu, Kom El Farag, Sidi Ghazi, Kom Defshu, Kom El Terfayeh, and Tell El Kanaies), where remains of pottery, and other items from Egypt&#x27;s Ptolemaic era can be found.

==Industry==
The city is renowned for electricity generation as well as textile and fruit packing industries. Misr for Weaving and Spinning is the largest company in Kafr El Dawwar. Other industrial activities include paint, silk fibers and chemicals. 
Agriculture is a major activity for the countryside that surrounds the industrial area.

==Geography==
The Mahmudiyya Canal () goes through Kafr El Dawwar north to Alexandria. It branches west from the Nile, and is the main source of drinking water and irrigation.

===Climate===
Kafr El Dawwar is classified by the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system as having a hot desert climate (BWh).

Its highest record temperature, 45 °C (113 °F), was recorded on 30 May 1961, while its lowest record temperature, 0 °C (32 °F), was recorded on 31 January 31, 1994. Kafr El Dawwar has, on average, 38 rainy days annually.

Rafah, Alexandria, Abu Qir, Rosetta, Baltim, Kafr El Dawwar, and Mersa Matruh are the wettest places in Egypt.

<text>Josef Abel (22 August 1768 – 4 October 1818) was an Austrian historical painter and etcher.

== Biography ==
Abel was born in Aschach an der Donau, Upper Austria. He visited the Academy in Vienna, which was at the time directed by Friedrich Heinrich Füger, and was one of his best scholars. Abel developed an interest for the ancient world, reflecting a popular direction in the art of the beginning of the 19th century in Germany and France. During the years 1801–1807, he studied in Italy, then returned to Vienna, where he became a member of the Academy on 8 February 1815 and remained till his death in 1818.

Among his famous works are paintings and etchings of Klopstock in Elysium, Orestes and Electra, Socrates and Theramenes as well as Emperor Francis I of Austria. He also painted the figural part of the front curtain of the old Burgtheater under directions of Füger.

For some time there has been discussion of whether his portrait of a young man with glasses is a portrayal of the young Franz Schubert.

<text>William Hartman Woodin (May 27, 1868 – May 3, 1934) was a U.S. industrialist. He served as the Secretary of Treasury under Franklin Roosevelt in 1933.

==Biography==
Woodin was born in Berwick, Pennsylvania. He was closely involved in Jackson and Woodin Manufacturing Company. His father, Clemuel Ricketts &quot;Clement&quot; Woodin, preceded him in the presidency of the company and his grandfather, also named William Hartman Woodin, was an early partner in the company. He was a member of the Union League Club of New York. Woodin graduated from the Columbia College School of Mines in 1890.

Jackson &amp; Woodin grew under this combined leadership to become the largest railroad car builder in the eastern United States, and was one of the 13 companies that merged in 1899 to form American Car and Foundry Company (ACF).

Woodin married Annie Jessup, on October 9, 1889. They had three daughters and one son: Mary, Annie Jessup, William Hartman Jr., and Elizabeth Foster Woodin. They lived in New York City.

Woodin stayed on with ACF for a while after the merger.

Woodin worked up through ACF management to become president in 1916. He was a director of several other companies including: chairman of the board of American Locomotive Company, chairman of the board of Railway Steel Spring Company, a director of Remington Arms Company, a director of Montreal Locomotive Works, and a director of American Ship and Commerce Company. He was a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 1927 through 1932.

As Will Woodin, he collaborated with children&#x27;s author Johnny Gruelle, composing music for the 1930 book &quot;Raggedy Ann&#x27;s Sunny Songs&quot; and was the namesake of Gruelle&#x27;s character Little Wooden Willie. In 1933, Woodin composed a march in honor of Roosevelt.
Woodin was a Republican businessman and was a major contributor to Roosevelt&#x27;s campaign in 1932. Woodin served as the Treasury Secretary from March 4, 1933, until he resigned effective December 31, 1933. Because of his poor health, for some weeks in 1933 Treasury Under-Secretary Dean Acheson served as the Acting Secretary of the Treasury. Woodin was involved in major decisions that the new Roosevelt administration made to combat the Great Depression.

On March 4, 1933, when Roosevelt first took the oath of office, banks were closing their doors all over the United States as waves of panic led depositors to demand immediate payment of their money. Woodin was the point man in the administration&#x27;s declaration of a &quot;Bank Holiday&quot; which closed every bank in the U.S. until bank examiners could determine which were sound enough to re-open. With &quot;seals of approval&quot; from the examiners, depositors regained confidence, and the vast majority left their money in bank deposits. This preceded the creation of deposit insurance and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation with the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933.

Woodin also presided over the Roosevelt Administration&#x27;s withdrawal from the international monetary conference in London and the decision to take the United States off the international gold standard there. While he was the Secretary of the Treasury, the Administration also began the decision-making process that eventually led to the administration&#x27;s decision to buy all the gold in private hands in the United States (other than that used by dentists and jewelers) and then to raise the dollar price of gold, devaluing the dollar against gold.

Treasury Under Secretary Dean Acheson opposed FDR on the latter two decisions and was forced to resign in November 1933. Woodin was an avid coin collector and when gold was withdrawn from private hands, he made certain that an exception was put in place for &quot;rare or unusual&quot; coins.

From 1930 until 1934 he was a trustee of Lafayette College.

He died in New York City, New York, and was buried in Pine Grove Cemetery, near his birthplace of Berwick, Pennsylvania.

Woodin is the great-grandfather of mathematician W. Hugh Woodin.

<text>Edita Gruberová (; 23 December 1946 – 18 October 2021) was a Slovak coloratura soprano. She made her stage debut in Bratislava in 1968 as Rosina in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot;, and successfully auditioned at the Vienna State Opera the following year, which became her base. She received international recognition for roles such as Mozart&#x27;s Queen of the Night in &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; and Zerbinetta in &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; by Richard Strauss.

In her later career, she explored heavier roles in the Italian bel canto repertoire, such as the title role in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, and Elvira in Bellini&#x27;s &quot;I puritani&quot;. In 2019, she portrayed Elisabetta in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot;, who leaves her throne, concluding a stage career performing leading roles over 51 years. She is remembered as the &quot;&quot; (Slovak Nightingale), and as prima donna assoluta.

== Early life and education ==
Edita Gruberová was born on 23 December 1946 in Rača, Bratislava, to a German father and a Hungarian mother. As an anti-communist, her father survived a five-year prison sentence for treason. Her father drank and she developed a close relationship with her mother. She sang in a school choir and in the children&#x27;s choir of the broadcaster. The pastor of the parish where she prepared for Confirmation accompanied her when she sang solos at church, and prepared her in piano playing to pass the exam to enter the conservatory. Gruberová began her musical studies at the Bratislava Conservatory (&quot;Konzervatórium v Bratislave&quot;), where she was a student of . She then continued at the Academy of Performing Arts in Bratislava (VŠMU). While studying there, she was a singer of the Lúčnica folk ensemble and appeared several times in the Slovak National Theatre. She would later study with Ruthilde Boesch in Vienna.

== Career ==
=== Opera ===
In 1968, Gruberová made her operatic debut at the National Theatre in Bratislava as Rosina in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot;. After winning a singing competition in Toulouse, she was then engaged as a soloist of the opera ensemble of the J. G. Tajovský Theatre in Banská Bystrica, Slovakia, from 1968 to 1970. Among her roles was Eliza Doolittle in Loewe&#x27;s musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. Since communist Czechoslovakia was going through normalisation, during which the borders to non-communist countries were closed, Medvecká surreptitiously arranged for an audition for Gruberová at the Vienna State Opera in the summer of 1969. She was immediately engaged, and made her breakthrough the following year when she appeared as the Queen of the Night in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;. In 1971, Gruberová decided to emigrate to the West. She became a member of the Vienna State Opera in 1972, where she was only given secondary and supporting roles in her early years. She was invited to perform at many of the most important opera houses in the world, especially in coloratura roles. Gruberová made her debut at Glyndebourne in 1973 as the Queen of the Night. She became an Austrian citizen in 1974.

In Vienna, she studied with Ruthilde Boesch, whom she described as a wonderful, tough, diligent teacher, the demanding role of Zerbinetta in &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; by Richard Strauss. Although a guest was planned to sing the role in a new production in 1976, Gruberová convinced conductor Karl Böhm that she was capable. The premiere won her international recognition, and Böhm said he wished that the composer could have heard that performance. Gruberová first appeared at the Metropolitan Opera, New York City in 1977, again as the Queen of the Night, conducted by James Conlon. She appeared as Zerbinetta in a live broadcast conducted by James Levine in 1979. Robert Jacobson of &quot;Opera News&quot;, in his review noted:

In 1977, she first appeared at the Salzburg Festival, as Thibault in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlo&quot;, conducted by Herbert von Karajan. In opera films, she performed as Gilda in Ponnelle&#x27;s 1982 film adaptation of &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, alongside Ingvar Wixell in the title role and Luciano Pavarotti as the Duke, and in his 1988 film adaptation of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, alongside Delores Ziegler and Ferruccio Furlanetto. Gruberová made her Royal Opera House debut as Giulietta in Bellini&#x27;s &quot;I Capuleti e i Montecchi&quot; in 1984. Other important roles include the title roles of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot;, Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, and Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Manon&quot;. She performed as Konstanze in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot;, and Oscar in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;.
Gruberová appeared as a regular guest at the Zürich Opera, as Marie in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;La fille du régiment&quot; in 1984, as Lucia in 1990, and in the title role of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Semiramide&quot; in 1992. She performed there in the title role of Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Linda di Chamounix&quot; in 1995, as Elvira in Bellini&#x27;s &quot;I puritani&quot; in 1999, in the title role of Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Anna Bolena&quot; in 2000, and in the title role of Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Beatrice di Tenda&quot; in 2001. The same year, she withdrew from all her performances at the Zürich Opera, after Alexander Pereira, then intendant, claimed that her dancer daughter&#x27;s injury, which forced her to quit dancing, was not an occupational accident. In 2012, she appeared there again in a recital, stepping in for Jonas Kaufmann. Later that year, after Pereira&#x27;s departure, she performed with the company again, in a revival of &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot;.

Gruberová appeared as Donna Anna in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; at La Scala in Milan in 1987 and as Elisabetta in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot; in Vienna in 1990. The latter became one of her signature roles; in a new production in Munich directed by Christof Loy, she made peace with &quot;Regietheater&quot; in a dramatic portrayal of the Queen, without losing her distinctive coloratura. She always performed coloratura ornamentation with dramatic expressiveness, with humour as Zerbinetta, and in rapture with a high trill as the dying Antonia in Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Les contes d&#x27;Hoffmann&quot;. In 2006, she added the title role in Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot; to her repertoire, at the Bavarian State Opera.

She gave her last opera performance on 27 March 2019 as Elisabetta in &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot; at the Bavarian State Opera. She concluded her stage career after 51 years of singing leading roles, and received ovations for 58 minutes. Jürgen Kesting, writing for the &quot;FAZ&quot;, allegorized her convincing portrayal of the aging Elizabeth I who leaves her throne and drew parallels to her retiring. She then focused on concerts and giving masterclasses. She officially retired from the stage in September 2020, in part due to delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic which made planning further performances difficult. Her last performance was in Gersthofen on 20 December 2019. Her two planned farewell performances in November 2020, in a semi-staged &quot;Roberto Devereux&quot; at the National Theatre Košice, were cancelled due to the pandemic.

=== &quot;Lied&quot; ===
Gruberová was introduced to &quot;Lieder&quot; repertoire by , a professor at the Vienna Music Academy, and repetiteur at the Vienna State Opera. They often performed together, until Erik Werba became her &quot;Lied&quot; partner with whom she performed songs by Franz Schubert, Gustav Mahler and Strauss. In 1980, they performed a recital at the Salzburg Festival with clarinetist Peter Schmidl, featuring songs by Mendelssohn, Schubert and Strauss.

=== Recognition === 
Gruberová was an Austrian and Bavarian Kammersängerin, and an honorary member of the Vienna State Opera from 1988. She was known as the &quot;Slowakische Nachtigall&quot; (Slovak Nightingale). Kesting recognized Gruberová as the last prima donna assoluta.

== Personal life ==
Gruberová was married to Štefan Klimo, a Czech composer and musicologist. They divorced in 1983 and Klimo died by suicide soon afterwards. Beginning in the 1980s, she had a long professional and personal relationship with Friedrich Haider, a pianist and conductor. They separated in 2007. She is the mother of two daughters, including the dancer and choreographer Barbara Klimo. She moved her residence to Zürich in the mid-1980s for tax reasons. 

Gruberová died of an accidental head injury in Zürich on 18 October 2021 at age 74.

== Recordings ==

Gruberová made many recordings, most notably in full-length opera, and extended selections from Donizetti&#x27;s Tudor Queens&#x27; trilogy and other bel canto operas. She recorded &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; with conductors Alain Lombard, Bernard Haitink and Nikolaus Harnoncourt, &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; with Georg Solti, and &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; with Heinz Wallberg, among others. In her later years, she recorded exclusively on the Nightingale label that she founded. More than a dozen of her filmed and televised opera appearances have been released on DVD, including &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;, &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot;, &quot;I puritani&quot;, &quot;Norma&quot;, &quot;Manon&quot;, &quot;Beatrice di Tenda&quot;, and Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot; and &quot;Linda di Chamounix&quot;, and &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;.

She recorded Bach&#x27;s solo cantatas for soprano, such as &quot;Jauchzet Gott in allen Landen&quot;, BWV 51, and &quot;Mein Herze schwimmt im Blut&quot;, BWV 199, in 1979, with Helmut Winschermann conducting the Deutsche Bachsolisten and trumpeter Wolfgang Basch. She also appeared as the soprano soloist in Giuseppe Sinopoli&#x27;s 1991 recording of Mahler&#x27;s Fourth Symphony.

<text>Harry Hines Woodring (May 31, 1887September 9, 1967) was an American politician. A Democrat, he was the 25th Governor of Kansas and the United States Assistant Secretary of War from 1933 to 1936. His most important role was Secretary of War in President Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s cabinet from 1936 to 1940. After 1938, Roosevelt rejected isolationism regarding Europe. Woodring quietly opposed Roosevelt and was eventually fired.

==Biography==
Harry Hines Woodring was born in 1887 in Elk City, Kansas, the son of farmer and Union Army soldier Hines Woodring. He was educated in city and county schools and at sixteen began work as a janitor. He attended Lebanon Business University in Lebanon, Indiana, for one year, which gained him employment as a bookkeeper and assistant cashier of the First National Bank in Elk City.

==Career==
Woodring soon became assistant cashier at the First National Bank of Neodesha. Woodring moved up quickly to become vice president and owner of the bank until he enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army. He was later commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Tank Corps in World War I. He was elected department commander of the American Legion in Kansas then in 1928 he sold his banking business to enter politics.

===Governor of Kansas===
Woodring won the Kansas gubernatorial election of 1930 in a controversial three-way race with Republican Frank Haucke and write-in candidate and goat-gland transplantation specialist, John Brinkley. Brinkley won the most votes, but the state only counted ballots with &quot;J. R. Brinkley&quot; written in, disqualifying tens of thousands of ballots with variants like &quot;John Brinkley&quot; written in. Woodring himself admitted he would have lost, had all Brinkley&#x27;s votes been counted. Woodring served as governor of Kansas from 1931 to 1933. As the only Democrat elected to a statehouse office, his efforts to cut expenditures were largely blocked by Republicans, so he cut his own salary and the highway department, the one place where Democrats had control.

Woodring ran for re-election in 1932, but lost to Republican Alf Landon in a three-way race, again featuring John Brinkley.

On July 25, 1933, Woodring married Helen Coolidge, with whom he had three children. Coolidge was the daughter of United States Senator Marcus A. Coolidge.

===War Department===
Woodring served as Assistant Secretary of War from 1933 to 1936, with supervision over procurement matters. He was promoted and served as Secretary of War in the Roosevelt cabinet from 1936 to 1940. He continued the recommendations of his predecessor for increasing the strength of the Regular Army, National Guard, and the Reserve Corps. During his tenure he directed a revision of mobilization plans to bring personnel and procurement into balance and stressed the need to perfect the initial (peacetime) protective force.

A strict non-interventionist, Woodring came under pressure from other cabinet members to resign in the first year of World War II. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes met with Roosevelt at least twice to call for Woodring&#x27;s firing, but FDR was at first unwilling to do so, instead appointing outspoken interventionist Louis A. Johnson as Woodring&#x27;s assistant secretary of war. Woodring and Johnson were immediately at odds, and quickly reached the point where they refused to speak to each other. On June 20, 1940, Roosevelt ended the struggle by finally firing Woodring, replacing him with long-time Republican politician Henry Stimson. Woodring remained isolationist, opposing the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940.

Woodring ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Kansas in 1946, and for the Democratic Party nomination for that post in 1956.

==Death==
Woodring died following a stroke in Topeka, Kansas, on September 9, 1967, at the age of 80. He is buried at the Mount Hope Cemetery in Topeka.

<text>George David Woods (July 27, 1901 – August 20, 1982) was an American investment banker and financier. He served as the fourth President of the World Bank, from January 1963 until March 1968. Prior to that he had a 46-year career in investment banking, rising to chairman of First Boston Corporation.

==Early life and education==

Woods was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1901. He grew up Brooklyn, New York City, where his father, who died when Woods was three, had moved the family to find shipyard work.

He attended high school at Commercial High School in Brooklyn.

==Career==
===Investment banking===
After graduating from high school, at the age of 17 Woods was employed on Wall Street as an office boy at the investment firm Harris, Forbes &amp; Co. At the company&#x27;s urging, he attended night school in banking theory and finance, and in the firm&#x27;s underwriting department he drafted prospectuses, did statistical work, and drew up contracts. in 1927, at the age of 26, he was promoted to a vice president position and given major projects. In 1930 Harris, Forbes &amp; Co. was acquired by Chase Bank, and Woods was made vice president of the new firm.

In 1933, the firm was dissolved after the passage of the Glass–Steagall Act, and Chase transferred what remained of its securities business to the Bank of Boston&#x27;s newly formed First Boston Corporation. Woods was included in the transfer and became vice president and a member of the board of First Boston Corporation.

First Boston became one of the largest investment banking firms in the United States, and Woods played a major role in that expansion. In 1947 he became one of two executive vice presidents, and in 1948 became chairman of the executive committee. In 1951 Woods became chairman of the board.

===World Bank===
Woods was first called to the World Bank by Eugene Black, the World Bank&#x27;s president from 1949 to 1962, who was an old associate and friend from Harris, Forbes. While at the World Bank, Black had asked him to help out on special assignments for the bank. Woods had thereby become familiar with the workings of the World Bank. In the summer of 1962, Black asked Woods to meet with the Kennedy Administration, which subsequently nominated him for president of the World Bank, and he accepted. He took office January 1, 1963.

Whereas the first three World Bank presidents had focused on loans for reconstruction, Woods shifted the bank towards a primary focus on less developed countries. By the end of Woods&#x27;s tenure, the bank was engaged in a far broader range of developmental activities than at its beginning.

Woods led a major expansion in the World Bank&#x27;s lending for agriculture and for agrarian reform. Woods also expanded lending for higher education, but only for technical and vocational schools. Additional lending went to water supply, and &quot;technical assistance&quot;. The various areas of developmental loans were considered &quot;riskier&quot; investments than reconstruction loans, and therefore justified the significant excess profits the World Bank had been making by the early 1960s.

The main beneficiaries of the new developmental lending were India and Pakistan, rather than the newly emerging African nations. From 1964 to the end of his tenure, Woods rebuffed most new requests from the newly emerging African nations.

In 1966, despite the General Assembly of the United Nations passing resolutions condemning the apartheid regime in South Africa and the continuing colonial subjugation of Angola and Mozambique by Portugal as violations of the U.N. charter, and despite a personal plea from U.N. Secretary General U Thant to Woods, the World Bank proceeded with a $10 million loan to Portugal and a $20 million loan to South Africa.

Woods increased the number, power, and influence of economists at the bank. In 1964 he hired Irving S. Friedman as the newly created position of economic advisor to the president. Friedman hired nearly 200 economists, thus increasing the overall World Bank staff by 25 percent. Friedman worked to change World Bank preferences from infrastructure projects toward policy-based economic development. The economists were instrumental in advancing American interests.

Woods strongly supported increased foreign private investment in developing countries. In his first address to the World Bank&#x27;s board, he pledged to explore “all possible ways in which the Bank can help to widen and deepen the flow of private capital to the developing countries”. He added that he was convinced that countries which accept this &quot;will achieve their development objectives more rapidly than those who do not&quot;, and &quot;that means, to mince no words about it, giving foreign investors a fair opportunity to make attractive profits&quot;.

==Additional posts==
Woods was a director of The New York Times Company. He was also one of the three trustees of the Ochs Trust, which holds a controlling interest in The New York Times Company and was established by Adolph S. Ochs, the publisher of &quot;The New York Times&quot; from 1896 until his death in 1935.

From 1961 to 1967, Woods was a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation. He was a member of the Commission on Population Growth and the American Future.

In addition, long after he had turned over the leadership of the First Boston Corporation of New York, Woods maintained an office in New York and was sought out by executives around the world for consultation.

He served as a director of numerous companies during his career.

Woods was a director of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, and chairman of the Repertory Theater of Lincoln Center.

For several years he was treasurer and a director of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, and helped his friend John Ringling North reorganize the circus.

==Honors==
* : Honorary Grand Commander of the Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia (1973)

==Personal life==
Woods married Louise Taraldson in 1935. They had no children. Louise was a civic leader, and became a trustee of the Institute of International Education.

Woods never moved to Washington DC, not even during his tenure as World Bank president. The couple lived in Manhattan, and had a second home in Lisbon.

Woods was close to Nelson A. Rockefeller, and for a time had a home at the Rockefeller estate at Pocantico Hills, New York.

Woods died in Lisbon in 1982 at the age of 81. His wife died in Manhattan in 1986 at the age of 78.

<text>Steve Tibbetts (born 1954) is an American guitarist and composer. He views the recording studio as a tool for creating sounds. Most of his albums include percussionist Marc Anderson.

== Style ==
Tibbetts plays acoustic and electric guitar and exotic percussive instruments such as the kendang and kalimba. His music has been described as rock, jazz, ambient, experimental, and world music. Tibbetts refers to it as &quot;postmodern neo-primitivism&quot;. Often more than one genre or style is found in a single composition.

On guitar he uses a string-bending technique to imitate a sarangi while alternating between ambient soundscapes and electric distortion. He incorporates field recording, such as the footsteps in the track &quot;Running&quot; from &quot;Safe Journey&quot; and the chanting of Nepalese villagers on &quot;Big Map Idea&quot;. His albums often include percussion by Marc Anderson. The album &quot;A Man About a Horse&quot; included tracks based on rhythms built from different pitches and speeds. These recordings were then sampled, sequenced, and looped on synthesizers. He stated, &quot;I go back and forth between the sampler and tape machine so much—looping, cutting, offsetting, and layering—that eventually I don&#x27;t know where the sounds come from.&quot; A collection of his loops and textures entitled &quot;Friendly Fire&quot; was released in 2002 by Sonic Foundry for their &quot;Acid Loops&quot; series.

== History ==
Tibbetts was born in Madison, Wisconsin, in 1954. When he was twelve years old, he started to play guitar and was attracted to the electric distortion of the Blind Joe Mendelbaum Blues Band. He went to Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, where he experimented with distortion pedals and other devices that could be plugged into a guitar. He met drummer Marc Anderson in college, and the two began a lifelong collaboration. Tibbetts has cited jazz guitarist Bill Connors as an influence and the fingerstyle technique of Harvey Mandel.

His first album, released in 1976, received attention on Minnesota public radio. His second, &quot;Yr&quot; (Frammis, 1980) was the first to be recorded with Anderson. His first album for a major label was &quot;Northern Song&quot; for ECM in 1982. This was an attempt to fit into producer Manfred Eicher&#x27;s style of recording in two or three days. &quot;Northern Song&quot; received scathing reviews. Tibbetts returned to his method of recording slowly over a period of months or longer. His subsequent records gained better reviews. He released five albums in the 1980s, three in the 1990s. He has collaborated with Norwegian hardingfele player Knut Hamre and Tibetan Buddhist nun Chöying Drolma.

Tibbetts stopped doing live performances regularly in the mid-1980s. Tibbetts and Anderson have toured on other occasions, including a 1988 YR tour, a 1991–1992 Big Map Idea tour, and shows with Chöying Drolma in 1997, 1999, and 2005. Starting in the late 1980s he travelled extensively in Nepal, which is where he met Drolma. Their first collaboration, &quot;Chö&quot;, was not intended as a commercial record but it was released and gained some positive notice. The second album, &quot;Selwa&quot;, was a more carefully considered collaboration and was praised as a successful meeting between different musical traditions. These albums helped establish Drolma&#x27;s career on the Nepalese music chart.

<text>William Burnham Woods (August 3, 1824 – May 14, 1887) was an American jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. An appointee of President Rutherford B. Hayes, he served from 1881 until 1887. He wrote the majority opinion in &quot;United States v. Harris&quot;, involving the constitutionality of the Ku Klux Klan Act, and &quot;Presser v. Illinois&quot;, involving the application of the Second Amendment to the states; both cases adopted a narrow interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment. He dissented rarely and wrote mostly uncontroversial opinions, and he has been largely forgotten by history.

Born in Newark, Ohio, Woods received his degree from Yale University. He practiced law in Newark and entered politics, soon rising to be the speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives. A Democrat, he initially opposed the Lincoln administration&#x27;s policies but supported the Union once the Civil War broke out. He joined the Union army as an officer, participating in a number of battles; after his discharge as a brevet major general in 1866, he settled in Alabama, where he practiced law and engaged in commercial activities.

In 1869, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Woods a circuit judge for the Fifth Circuit, which covered six Southern states. In the &quot;Slaughter-House Cases&quot; and &quot;United States v. Cruikshank&quot;, he favored a broad interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment that contrasted with the narrower one he supported on the Supreme Court. In another case, he upheld &quot;separate but equal&quot; schools. Hayes nominated Woods to the Supreme Court in 1880, and he was confirmed by the Senate 39–8. On the Court, he was a diligent worker who wrote more opinions than any other associate justice during his six-year tenure. He was struck ill in spring 1886 and died in 1887.

==Early life, education, and career==
William Burnham Woods was born in Newark, Ohio, on August 3, 1824, to Ezekiel S. Woods, a Kentucky-born merchant and farmer, and Sarah Burnham Woods, who was from New England. He attended Western Reserve College (now Case Western Reserve University) before transferring to Yale University, from which he graduated as valedictorian in 1845. After returning to Newark, he studied law under the tutelage of S. D. King, a prominent lawyer; the two became partners after Woods was admitted to the bar in 1847. Woods took an interest in politics in the 1850s. While some evidence suggests that he was at first a Whig, he later became a member of the Democratic Party. In 1855, he married Anne E. Warner, with whom he had two children.

Woods became Newark&#x27;s mayor in 1856, and the following year he was elected as a Democrat to the Ohio House of Representatives, immediately becoming its speaker. At first Woods staunchly opposed the policies of the Lincoln administration, but when the Civil War broke out, he supported the Union cause, vowing to stand by the federal government &quot;in sunshine or storm, in peace or war, right or wrong&quot;. In February 1862, he joined the 76th Ohio Infantry Regiment as a lieutenant colonel, becoming colonel in September when the previous colonel – his brother, Charles R. Woods – was promoted to brigadier general.

Woods served in the Battle of Shiloh, the Siege of Vicksburg, and Sherman&#x27;s March. He was made brigadier general in 1865 and participated in the Grand Review of the Armies in Washington. Just before his discharge in February 1866, he was brevetted a major general at the recommendation of Generals Sherman, Ulysses S. Grant, and John A. Logan. After being mustered out, Woods settled in Alabama, where he had been serving; there he practiced law, involved himself in cotton production, and invested in ironworks. He had by this time become a Republican, and in 1868 he was elected on the Republican ticket chancellor of the middle chancery division of Alabama.

== Circuit judge ==
An 1869 judicial reorganization law created nine new circuit judgeships. President Grant appointed Woods to be circuit judge for the Fifth Circuit, which comprised Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, and he was sworn in on December 22, 1869. Little information is available as to why the President selected Woods, but Thomas E. Baynes Jr. suggests that his Republican politics, his military service with Grant, and the fact that his brother-in-law Willard Warner was a U.S. Senator all played a role.

Woods and Justice Joseph P. Bradley (who was riding circuit) heard the &quot;Slaughter-House Cases&quot; in 1870; in an opinion by Bradley, they both agreed that the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Privileges or Immunities Clause should be interpreted broadly to protect civil rights associated with U.S. citizenship against infringement by the states. In another privileges-and-immunities decision, &quot;United States v. Hall&quot; (1871), Woods sustained an indictment under the Enforcement Act of 1870, holding that the Fourteenth Amendment gave Congress the power to protect the freedoms of speech and of assembly through legislation. The Supreme Court&#x27;s 1873 ruling in the &quot;Slaughter-House Cases&quot; rejected Bradley and Woods&#x27;s broader interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment. In the 1874 Enforcement Act case of &quot;United States v. Cruikshank&quot;, Bradley dismissed federal charges against the perpetrators of the Colfax massacre, in which scores of African-American men were killed, but Woods dissented without an opinion; when the case reached the Supreme Court by certificate of division, it affirmed Bradley&#x27;s decision.

Woods expended considerable effort to learn Louisiana law, which was especially complicated due to its French and Spanish roots. In the aftermath of the contested 1876 presidential election, he avoided becoming involved in a dispute over the eligibility of a Florida Republican elector who had attempted to resign another federal office by writing to Woods. Woods&#x27;s 1878 decision in &quot;Bertonneau v. Board of Directors of City Schools&quot; upheld &quot;separate but equal&quot; schools for blacks and whites; he wrote: &quot;White children and colored children are compelled to attend different schools. That is all. The state, while conceding equal privileges and advantages to both races, has the right to manage its schools in the manner which, in its judgment, will best promote the interest of all.&quot; Woods moved to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1877.

== Supreme Court nomination ==
Ohio notables and Southern congressmen recommended Woods for an 1877 vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court, but President Rutherford B. Hayes nominated John Marshall Harlan instead. In December 1880, the press reported that Justice William Strong intended to resign. Bradley wanted to take his place as circuit justice for the Third Circuit, which would leave the Fifth Circuit position vacant—making it preferable for Strong&#x27;s replacement to have experience with Louisiana and Texas law. Additionally, Woods&#x27;s connections to both North and South made him &quot;precisely the kind of candidate Hayes sought to help bind bitter sectional wounds&quot;, according to the legal scholar Henry J. Abraham. Strong submitted his letter of resignation on December 14, and the following day Hayes nominated Woods to take his place. Despite concerns that too many justices from Ohio were being appointed (Chase, Waite, Swayne, Woods, and the rumored next nominee Stanley Matthews were all associated with that state), the Senate confirmed him by a vote of 39 to 8 on December 21, 1880. He was sworn in on January 5, 1881.

== Supreme Court service ==
Woods remained on the Supreme Court until his death in 1887. A hard worker on a Court deluged with cases, he wrote more opinions during his tenure than any other associate justice. Most of his opinions for the Court were in uncontroversial cases, often involving real property, patents, taxation, commerce, municipal law, trusts, or corporations. He participated in nearly 1,500 cases but dissented only eight times, and Baynes states that he &quot;clearly should be characterized with the majority of the Court&quot;. His jurisprudence was generally nationalistic: he joined the majority in &quot;Juilliard v. Greenman&quot; to hold that the federal government could lawfully print paper money, and he dissented when the Court held in &quot;United States v. Lee&quot; that individuals could sue federal officers. In &quot;Elk v. Wilkins&quot;, he joined a dissent by Harlan when the majority held that Native Americans were not U.S. citizens.

Woods interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment more narrowly and conservatively on the Supreme Court than he had on the Fifth Circuit. He wrote for an eight-justice majority in &quot;United States v. Harris&quot; (1883) that the Fourteenth Amendment did not authorize laws that prohibit individuals from interfering with other individuals&#x27; civil rights. The decision, which involved defendants charged with breaking into a jail and beating four black prisoners (in one case to death), held that the Ku Klux Klan Act exceeded Congress&#x27;s power. &quot;Harris&quot; set the stage for the Court&#x27;s 8–1 decision later that year in the &quot;Civil Rights Cases&quot;, in which Woods joined the majority in holding much of the Civil Rights Act of 1875 unconstitutional. In &quot;Presser v. Illinois&quot;, involving a man convicted of violating Illinois law by carrying firearms as part of a private militia, Woods&#x27;s opinion for a unanimous Court held that the Second Amendment applied only to the federal government; it &quot;limited the possibilities of applying the Bill of Rights to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment&quot;, according to the legal scholar Robert J. Cottrol.

Woods became suddenly ill in the spring of 1886 and did not participate in the Court&#x27;s 1886–87 term; the details of his illness are not known. His condition seemed to be improving during a lengthy stay in California, but it soon worsened. Woods died aged 62 on May 14, 1887, in Washington, D.C., and he was buried at the Cedar Hill Cemetery in Newark, Ohio. President Grover Cleveland nominated Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar to replace him.

==Legacy==
The scholar Louis Filler began a 1969 essay on Woods by describing him as &quot;one of the least known of all the Justices who have served on the United States Supreme Court&quot;. A 1970 survey of law professors rated him &quot;below average&quot;, but the legal scholar D. Grier Stephenson suggests that this rating &quot;probably results more from general unfamiliarity than from a careful appraisal of his work&quot;. The historian Stephen Cresswell attributes Woods&#x27;s low historical reputation to his brief tenure, the frequency of his votes with the majority, and perceptions that he was a carpetbagger with a &quot;muddled judicial philosophy&quot;. According to Timothy L. Hall, &quot;[m]ore a follower than a leader, more an echo of the reverberating ideas of others than an original thinker in his own right, his brief years on the Court climaxed a life too far removed from the center of events to warrant more than passing historical mention&quot;.

<text>99 Posse is an Italian hip hop/reggae group from Naples. It raps both in Italian and in the local Neapolitan language. Most of 99 Posse&#x27;s songs deal with political or social issues, and the group members are considered left-wing hardliners. As a showing of their activism, all of the group&#x27;s albums have been released with a &quot;prezzo politico&quot; (&quot;political price&quot;): each CD displays a sticker saying &quot;Don&#x27;t pay more than...&quot;. For &quot;99 Posse&quot;, this means &quot;putting into practice a specific understanding about their relationship with the market, a sort of ideal practice&quot;. The group has gained popularity in Italy through its songs and its voicing of progressive political causes.

Its first album, &quot;Curre Curre Guagliò&quot; (1993), was mainly influenced by reggae and world music. Subsequent albums, &quot;Cerco Tiempo&quot; (1996) and &quot;Corto Circuito&quot; (1998), included new styles like drum &#x27;n bass and trip hop. &quot;Curre Curre Guaglio&quot; was self-produced but rose from its underground status to become an iconic album and cultural manifesto that eventually inspired the film &quot;Sud&quot; by Oscar-winning director Gabriele Salvatores. The group also has its own record label, Novenove, which works to promote underground artists.

On 18 July 2009, they came back without Meg in Naples during a concert created by movements against repression and the blocking of 21 activists for G8 in Turin&#x27;s university.

<text>John Maynard Woodworth (August 15, 1837 – March 14, 1879) was an American physician and member of the Woodworth political family. He served as the first Supervising-Surgeon General under president Ulysses S. Grant, then changed to Surgeon General of the United States Marine Hospital Service from 1871 to 1879.

==Early life and education==
Woodworth was born at Big Flats, Chemung County, New York. His family soon moved to Illinois, where Woodworth attended school in Warrenville. He studied pharmacy at the University of Chicago and worked as a pharmacist for a time.

Woodworth was one of the organizers of the Chicago Academy of Science and in 1858 became curator of its museum. In this capacity, he made several trips west of the Mississippi River to collect natural history specimens. He was appointed naturalist by the University of Chicago in 1859 and asked to establish a museum of natural history. Woodworth also spent time working at the Smithsonian Institution over the next few years. He then decided to embark on medical studies, and graduated from the Chicago Medical College in 1862.

==Career==
Almost immediately upon graduating from medical school, Woodworth was appointed Assistant Surgeon in the Union Army. He was soon promoted to Surgeon and eventually became Medical Director of the Army of the Tennessee. Woodworth served under General William Tecumseh Sherman, and on &quot;Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea&quot; he was in charge of the ambulance train, bringing the sick and wounded to Savannah without the loss of a single man.

After the war, Woodworth became a companion of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

Following the Civil War, Woodworth spent a year in Europe, receiving clinical instruction chiefly in the hospitals of Berlin and Vienna. In 1866, he became demonstrator in anatomy at the Chicago Medical College. He was also appointed Surgeon of the Soldier&#x27;s home of Chicago and Sanitary Inspector of the Chicago Board of Health in that same year.

==Surgeon General==
In 1871, Woodworth was appointed the first Supervising Surgeon of the Marine Hospital Service. The Service had its origins in a 1798 Act of Congress &quot;for the relief of sick and disabled seamen.&quot; The 1798 law created a fund to be used by the Federal Government of the United States to provide medical services to merchant seamen in American ports, which was expanded to include military and others who made their living associated with seagoing. The marine hospital fund was administered by the Treasury Department and financed through a monthly deduction from the wages of the seamen. Medical care was provided through contracts with existing hospitals and, increasingly as time went on, through the construction of new hospitals for this purpose. The earliest marine hospitals were located along the East Coast of the United States, with Boston being the site of the first such facility, but later they were also established along inland waterways, the Great Lakes, and the Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast.

The marine hospitals hardly constituted a system in the Antebellum period. Funds for the hospitals were inadequate, political rather than medical reasons often influenced the choice of sites for hospitals and the selection of physicians, and the Treasury Department had little supervisory authority over the hospitals. During the Civil War, the Union and Confederate forces occupied the hospitals for their own use, and in 1864 only 8 of the 27 hospitals listed before the war were operational. In 1869, the United States Secretary of the Treasury commissioned an extensive study of the marine hospitals, and the resulting critical report led to the passage of reform legislation in the following year.

The 1870 reorganization converted the loose network of locally controlled hospitals into a centrally controlled Marine Hospital Service, with its headquarters in Washington, D.C. The position of Supervising Surgeon (later Surgeon General) was created to administer the Service. Woodworth began his service in the position on March 29, 1871, and he moved quickly to reform the system. He adopted a military model for his medical staff, instituting examinations for applicants instead of appointing physicians on the recommendation of the local Collector of Customs. Physicians, whom Woodworth placed in uniforms, were no longer appointed to serve in a particular facility, but appointed to the general Service. In this way, Woodworth created a cadre of mobile, career service physicians who could be assigned and moved as needed to the various marine hospitals. The uniformed services component of the Marine Hospital Service was formalized as the Commissioned Corps by legislation enacted in 1889 under Woodworth&#x27;s successor, John B. Hamilton.

In 1872, Woodworth initiated the publication of annual reports of the Marine Hospital Service. That same year he also served as one of the founders of the American Public Health Association.

From the time of his appointment, Woodworth envisioned broader responsibilities for the Marine Hospital Service, well beyond the care of merchant seamen. In 1873, his title was changed to Supervising Surgeon General. He issued publications on cholera and yellow fever, and laid the foundations for the passage of the National Quarantine Act of 1878. This Act conferred quarantine authority on the Marine Hospital Service, initiating a process whereby over the next half a century the Service progressively took over quarantine functions from the states. The Act also authorized the publication of &quot;Bulletins of the Public Health&quot; (the forerunner of the Service&#x27;s journal &quot;Public Health Reports&quot;). The Marine Hospital Service thus moved into public health activities under Woodworth, paving the way for its later evolution into the Public Health Service.

Woodworth also designed the seal of the Service, which he first used on a publication that he authored in 1874 on Nomenclature of Diseases. The seal consisted of a fouled anchor, to represent the seamen cared for by the Service, and the caduceus of Mercury. The latter symbol was particularly appropriate since it served as a symbol of commerce (which could represent the merchant marine) but was also used by the Army Medical Corps as its symbol. With minor changes in design, this device has remained the seal of the Public Health Service to the present day.

Woodworth remained in the position of Supervising Surgeon General until his death in Washington, DC, on March 14, 1879.

<text>Theodore Dwight Woolsey (31 October 1801 – 1 July 1889) was an American academic, author and President of Yale College from 1846 through 1871.

==Biography==
Theodore Dwight Woolsey was born 31 October 1801 in New York City. His mother was Elizabeth Dwight (1772–1813) and father was William Walton Woolsey (1766–1839).
At Yale, he served as President of the secret society, Brothers in Unity, and then graduated as valedictorian of his class from Yale College in 1820. He spent a year in legal study in Philadelphia, and two years of the study of theology at Princeton. For some time, Woolsey was a tutor at Yale, then went abroad to study Greek in Leipzig, Bonn, and Berlin. From 1831 to 1846, he was professor of Greek at Yale.

Woolsey&#x27;s mother&#x27;s brother Timothy Dwight (1752–1817) had been president of Yale 1795–1817. Jeremiah Day was the only president Yale had in between the family members.

Woolsey was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1845. After being chosen as president of Yale, he instructed students of history, political economy, political science, and especially international law.
He resigned as president of Yale in 1871. After Noah Porter served as president, the office was back in the family as his cousin once removed Timothy Dwight V (1828–1916), was selected in 1886. In 1871, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

During his 25 years as president, Yale advanced in wealth and influence and two new departments, the Scientific School and the School of Fine Arts, were begun. Woolsey was one of the founders of the &quot;New Englander&quot;, chairman of the American commission for the revision of the Authorized Version of the Bible, president of the World&#x27;s Evangelical Alliance at its international meeting in New York, a lifelong member and at one time president of the American Oriental Society, and a regent of the Smithsonian Institution. Among Woolsey&#x27;s writings and publications are these: Editions of the &quot;Alcestis&quot; of Euripides (1834), of the &quot;Antigone&quot; of Sophocles (1835), of the &quot;Prometheus&quot; of Æschylus (1837), of the &quot;Electra&quot; of Sophocles (1837), and of the &quot;Gorgias&quot; of Plato (1843); an edition of Lieber&#x27;s &quot;Civil liberty and Self Government&quot;, and:
* &quot;Introduction to the study of International Law&quot; (1860, many times republished)
* &quot;Essays on Divorce and Divorce Legislation&quot; (1869)
* &quot;Religion of the Present and Future&quot;, a collections of sermons (1871)
* &quot;Political Science&quot; (1877)
* &quot;Communism and Socialism&quot; (1880)
* &quot;Helpful Thoughts for Young Men&quot; (1882)

==Family and legacy==

Woolsey married twice and had a total of 13 children.
On 5 September 1833, he married Martha Salisbury, who was born 30 November 1812 and died 3 November 1852. Their children were:
# Edward Salisbury Woolsey was born 10 June 1834, but died from scarlet fever on 17 December 1843.
# Elizabeth Woolsey was born 30 November 1835, but died in the same scarlet fever epidemic on the same day as her two brothers.
# Agnes Woolsey was born 30 June 1838, married Edgar Laing Heermance (1833–1888), had three children and died in 1915.
# William Walton Woolsey was born 12 June 1840, and died in the 1843 scarlet fever epidemic.
# Laura Woolsey was born 22 June 1842 but died of typhoid fever on 23 March 1861.
# Catherine Woolsey was born 17 January 1845 but died 7 June 1854.
# Martha Woolsey was born 7 July 1847 but died 6 December 1870.
# Helen Woolsey was born 7 August 1849 but died 8 December 1870.
# Theodore Salisbury Woolsey was born 22 October 1852 and died 24 April 1929.

On 6 September 1854, Woolsey married Sarah Sears Prichard, who was born 3 March 1824 and died in 1900.
Their children were:
# Mary Pritchard Woolsey born 1 September 1855, married Alfred Terry Bacon and died in 1931.
# John Muirson Woolsey was born 13 February 1858 but died from typhoid fever 13 March 1861.
# George Woolsey was born 2 May 1861.
# Edith Woolsey was born 2 July 1864.

Woolsey died 1 July 1889 in New Haven.

Woolsey was a descendant of George (Joris) Woolsey, one of the earliest settlers of New Amsterdam, and Thomas Cornell (settler).

Woolsey Hall at Yale, completed in 1901, and Woolsey Street in New Haven, Connecticut are named in his honor. The statue erected in Woolsey&#x27;s memory, now displayed on Yale&#x27;s Old Campus, has a golden toe from being rubbed for good luck.

<text>Ledley Brenton King (born 12 October 1980) is an English former professional footballer. A one-club man, he spent his entire career with Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur and played 323 competitive matches for them from 1999 to 2012. He is currently a club ambassador for Tottenham Hotspur.

Highly rated as a central defender, in 2009 he was named by &quot;The Times&quot; as Tottenham&#x27;s 25th best player of all time. From 2002 to 2010, King made 21 international appearances for England, scoring twice and representing the nation at UEFA Euro 2004 and the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

In the latter part of his career, King was plagued by chronic knee problems, for which no effective treatment or remedy was found. Instead of training with the rest of the squad King undertook fitness exercises on his own, allowing him to play one first team game per week. His former manager Harry Redknapp called King &quot;an absolute freak&quot; for being able to perform at a Premier League level despite not training. Whilst playing, King was cited by opponents and pundits as one of the best defenders in the Premier League.

King announced his retirement from all forms of football on 19 July 2012 as a result of the chronic knee injuries that plagued much of his career. In August 2020, King was appointed assistant first team coach to work alongside José Mourinho and other coaching staff at Tottenham.

==Early career ==
King was born in Bow, London in 1980. As a youth footballer, he played for Senrab F.C. and the Tower Hamlets district representative team. He attended the Blessed John Roche RC School, which is now closed. King joined Tottenham as a trainee in July 1996 and progressed through the youth system. Whilst a trainee, he was identified as having qualities and instincts similar to Bobby Moore.

==Club career==
===1999–2001===
His debut came in May 1999 at Anfield ending in a 3–2 defeat to Liverpool. When breaking into the first team under former manager George Graham he was often used as a midfielder. It was with a performance in central midfield during Tottenham&#x27;s 2–1 win over Liverpool in November 2000 that he established himself as a regular in the Spurs side. His first goal for Tottenham came in December 2000 in a 3–3 draw away to Bradford City after just ten seconds, setting a new Premier League record for the quickest goal. This record stood for over 18 years, finally beaten by Shane Long, scoring for Southampton on 23 April 2019 after only 7.69 seconds.

===2006–2012===
After injuring his knee in training before the start of the season, King did not start his season until mid-September. Then after breaking his metatarsal again, he did not feature for Spurs from Boxing Day until the UEFA Cup quarter-final clash with Sevilla in mid-April. Spurs played 59 games in all competitions that season, but King featured in less than half of them. Tottenham only managed 3 clean sheets against top flight opposition without King in the side. In a Premier League clash with reigning champions Chelsea at White Hart Lane, Spurs went on to win the game 2–1, meaning King had captained Tottenham to their first league win over Chelsea since 1990, and the first at White Hart Lane since 1987.

King underwent surgery in the summer, meaning he would miss the start of the season. Manager Martin Jol had been sacked and replaced by Juande Ramos. But on Boxing Day 2007, King made a surprise return to the starting line-up against Fulham, playing 73 minutes before being replaced by Adel Taarabt. He appeared sporadically for the rest of the season, but captained Tottenham to a 2–1 victory over Chelsea in the 2008 League Cup final, the first major honour of his career.

On 3 April 2008, it was announced that he would be rested for the remainder of the season, Spurs having been knocked out of the UEFA Cup, FA Cup and unable to qualify for the Champions League through the League. King had featured in just 10 games all season, with just four Premiership games under his belt.

On 12 August 2008, King picked up the trophy for the cleanest team in the Premier league for the season. He received the award at the &#x27;Get on with the Game&#x27; programme which was shown on Sky Sports News. 

It became clear at the start of the 2008–09 season that King&#x27;s injury problems meant that he could not play in every game. Ramos picked him in all five of the cup games he managed the club for that season, but only two of the eight league games. With Spurs rooted to the bottom of the league, having picked up just 2 points from those 8 games, Ramos was sacked and replaced by Harry Redknapp, who chose to prioritise the league and only play King in those games. On 26 October 2008, King made his 200th league appearance for Tottenham Hotspur as they defeated Bolton Wanderers 2–0. He captained the club in the League Cup final yet again, this time against Manchester United, keeping a clean sheet after 120 minutes of play, but Tottenham lost on penalties.

Harry Redknapp said of King&#x27;s knee injury:

&quot;There&#x27;s no cure. There&#x27;s no cartilage, nothing to operate on. It&#x27;s just bone on bone. So it&#x27;s just a question of managing it. It swells up after games and it normally takes seven days to recover but having played on Monday night he&#x27;s had less time than usual. He rarely trains, he mostly just goes to the gym to keep himself ticking over. But not running or anything like that. But even if he only plays 20 games a season, he&#x27;s worth having because he&#x27;s so good we have a much better chance of winning.&quot;

King won his first game ever against Arsenal in the league on 14 April 2010, with a 2–1 win, of which he played 90 minutes. Exactly three weeks later, on 5 May 2010 King captained Tottenham to a 1–0 away victory at Manchester City, thus guaranteeing Tottenham&#x27;s highest ever finish in the Premier League and securing entry into the qualification round of the UEFA Champions League for the first time. King had been a major doubt for the match having played against Bolton just 4 days earlier, however his performance in this game and many other games in early 2010 look to have secured his place in Fabio Capello&#x27;s England squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. On 16 May 2010 it was reported that King had signed a new two-year contract extension with Spurs which would keep him at the club until 2012. It was rumoured that King had been released by Tottenham after The Premier League released a list of players who would not be staying at their clubs; with King included on the list. This was confirmed to be incorrect by Tottenham, who said they were still in the process of offering King a new deal.

The following season he made 3 appearances for Tottenham in the UEFA Champions League. In 2011, a steel statue of King was erected in Mile End Park.

On 19 July 2012, King announced he would retire from football. He has continued at Tottenham as a club ambassador. Thierry Henry stated he was the best defender he had played against and the only one to tackle him without resorting to fouling. Throughout the whole of his career King received only eight yellow cards, unusual even for a relatively short career.

===Testimonial===
On 12 May 2014, Ledley made a final playing appearance at White Hart Lane in his testimonial match. King with a Guests XI featuring David Ginola, Teddy Sheringham and Dimitar Berbatov faced a Tottenham Hotspur team made up of first and reserve team players. The game finished 6–3 to the Ledley XI, with King opening the scoring from the penalty spot, and Louis Saha netting a second half hat trick for the XI.

==International career==

King&#x27;s England debut came in a 1–2 loss to Italy in March 2002. He was called into the England squad for the friendly against Portugal on 18 February 2004, and netted his first goal on his third appearance.

King received his England call-up for Euro 2004 deputising for the injured John Terry in the opener against France in Portugal. He also made a substitute appearance in midfield in the final group game against Croatia.

After featuring regularly in the qualifiers, King looked a likely participant in the England 2006 World Cup squad before fracturing a bone in his foot on 15 April 2006. Although not as bad as a similar injury affecting David Beckham, Gary Neville and Steven Gerrard, King&#x27;s injury prevented him from being named in Sven-Göran Eriksson&#x27;s squad. &quot;Ledley King is injured and he can&#x27;t train. If you talk about centre-halves we are very well covered, so taking another one half-injured when we have so many good ones it is not a good idea.&quot;

King played in the Euro 2008 qualifier against Estonia on 6 June 2007. King played 90 minutes and England won 3–0. Although he featured in Fabio Capello&#x27;s first squad, he had to pull out through injury. Due to the chronic knee condition which preventing him holding down a regular place in the club side he was also not selected for England games for the rest of 2007 and during the whole of 2008.

On 22 March 2009, King was given a recall by head coach Fabio Capello to the team to play Slovakia and Ukraine. However, two days later he was removed from the squad after being assessed by England&#x27;s medical staff, who thought it was in his best interests to continue his personal training regimen at his club, due to the chronic knee condition that he has.
Fabio Capello later said, in response to Harry Redknapp&#x27;s objection to King&#x27;s call-up, &quot;Without doubt, King is one of the best central defenders in England. If he was fit, Redknapp would not need to make the journey. King could come with us.&quot; He later promoted King&#x27;s cause again, saying that &quot;We hope (he has an international future), because he&#x27;s a very interesting player – one of the best centre-backs. But I don&#x27;t know the future.&quot;

On 11 May 2010, King was named in the 30-man provisional squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup alongside fellow Spurs central defender Michael Dawson. He went on to score a headed goal against Mexico in the first preparation friendly on 24 May.

King made it into England&#x27;s World Cup 2010 squad. On 12 June 2010, King played 45 minutes for England in their opening match against the US, before picking up a groin injury which kept him out of the rest of the tournament.

==Coaching career==
On 26 July 2020, Tottenham Hotspur manager José Mourinho confirmed King&#x27;s appointment as an assistant coach for the club. On 6 August 2020, Tottenham announced that King, who had previously been a club ambassador, would be a first-team assistant coach. Following the sacking of Jose Mourinho, King returned full time to his club ambassador duties.

==Personal life==
King is a cousin of Ipswich Town full-back Ben Johnson.

===2009 arrest===
On 10 May 2009 at 2:30 am, King was arrested on Soho Street on suspicion of a racially aggravated common assault outside a London nightclub. He spent the night in a police cell and was subsequently bailed until mid-July while the police investigated the incident. King later issued an apology to his club, saying:
&quot;I sincerely regret that a night out with friends went too far. I have apologised to Harry and I fully appreciate that, as a professional footballer, I have a duty to behave in a responsible manner&quot;, King said in a statement on the club&#x27;s website. &quot;I am assisting the police with their enquiries. Anyone who knows me, knows that much of what has been suggested is totally out of character. I am keen to resolve this as soon as possible and concentrate on my football.&quot;
This prompted his manager at Tottenham, Harry Redknapp, to promise a ban on alcohol for Tottenham players:
&quot;I&#x27;ll implement a strong rule next season that drinking is a no-no here. Footballers should not drink. You shouldn&#x27;t put diesel in a Ferrari. I know it&#x27;s hard but they are earning big money, they are role models to kids. We wouldn&#x27;t get these problems if the players weren&#x27;t drinking. There&#x27;s still too much of a drinking culture in English football but it&#x27;s not as bad as it used to be. At Tottenham we do a lot with kids, a lot of them underprivileged. We have to set an example. Too much drinking goes on in this country. Too many people are not happy unless they have had a drink.&quot;

<doc id="750211" wikidata="Q6282899" url="?curid=750211" title="Joseph Emerson Worcester">
<text>Joseph Emerson Worcester (August 24, 1784 – October 27, 1865) was an American lexicographer who was the chief competitor to Noah Webster of &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; in the mid-nineteenth-century. Their rivalry became known as the &quot;dictionary wars&quot;. Worcester&#x27;s dictionaries focused on traditional pronunciation and spelling, unlike Noah Webster&#x27;s attempts to Americanize words. Worcester was respected by American writers and his dictionary maintained a strong hold on the American marketplace until a later, posthumous version of Webster&#x27;s book appeared in 1864. After Worcester&#x27;s death in 1865, their war ended.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Worcester was born August 24, 1784, in Bedford, New Hampshire, and worked on a farm in his youth, entering Phillips Academy, Andover, in 1805. In 1809, he entered Yale University and graduated in two years. He began a school in Salem, Massachusetts, in March 1812, but gave up on the project by 1815. One of his students had been a young Nathaniel Hawthorne; Worcester tutored Hawthorne privately at the boy&#x27;s home. During this time, Worcester worked on several works on geography, including &quot;A Geographical Dictionary, or Universal Gazetteer, Ancient and Modern&quot;, which was published in 1817. In 1823, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences He wrote a much-used textbook, &quot;Elements of History, Ancient and Modern, accompanied by an Historical Atlas&quot;, published in 1827. Worcester collected philological works and wrote a journal in Europe in 1831. For many years, he co-edited the annual &quot;American Almanac and Repository of Useful Knowledge&quot;. He earned LL.D. degrees from Brown University (1847) and Dartmouth College (1856).

===Dictionary war===
Worcester&#x27;s first edited dictionary was an abridgment of Samuel Johnson&#x27;s &quot;English Dictionary, as Improved by Todd, and Abridged by Chalmers; with Walker&#x27;s Pronouncing Dictionary Combined&quot;, published in the United States in 1827, the year before Noah Webster&#x27;s &quot;American Dictionary&quot; appeared. Having worked as an assistant on the production of Webster&#x27;s dictionary, he produced an abridgment of Webster&#x27;s work in 1829. Worcester believed that Webster&#x27;s dictionary sacrificed tradition and elegance. Worcester&#x27;s version added new words, excluded etymology, and focused on pronunciation.
Worcester published his &quot;Comprehensive Pronouncing and Explanatory English Dictionary&quot; in 1830, inciting charges of plagiarism from Webster. Worcester protested that he had worked on his dictionary before working for Webster and had used his own research. Webster&#x27;s first accusations against Worcester were in March 1831, when he wrote to ask if Worcester had taken many definitions from his own work. Worcester replied, &quot;No, not many.&quot; Accusation became attack in 1834, the Worcester, Massachusetts-based &quot;Palladium&quot; published an article that called Worcester&#x27;s book &quot;a gross plagiarism&quot; and stated that its author &quot;pilfer[ed] the products of the mind, as readily as... the common thief.&quot; Webster later published an open letter to Worcester in the &quot;Palladium&quot; dated January 25, 1835, accusing Worcester of stealing the definitions of 121 words, claiming their definitions were not published in any other dictionary and challenging Worcester to prove otherwise. Worcester responded saying that the burden of proof fell on Webster but provided his sources anyway. In what is often referred to as the &quot;dictionary wars&quot;, rivalry and contention between the two dictionaries continued beyond Webster&#x27;s death in 1843, and long after with Webster&#x27;s successor, the G. &amp; C. Merriam Company, which bought rights to the &quot;American Dictionary&quot;.

Worcester continued to revise his dictionary, producing &quot;A Universal and Critical Dictionary of the English Language&quot; in 1846. When a British edition of the work stated that it was based on the work of Noah Webster, and omitted Worcester&#x27;s introductory statement claiming otherwise, he responded with &quot;A Gross Literary Fraud Exposed&quot;.
In 1860, Worcester published &quot;A Dictionary of the English Language&quot;, a substantially revised and expanded work which was soon recognized as a major English language dictionary. The first copies were electrotype printed at the Boston Stereotype Foundry. The dictionary featured numerous illustrations throughout the text, a relatively new innovation. However, Worcester&#x27;s work was not technically the first American dictionary to feature illustrations. Having heard about the plans for Worcester&#x27;s new edition, Webster&#x27;s publishers, George and Charles Merriam, rushed to put out a similar work. They managed to publish a Pictorial Edition of Webster&#x27;s &quot;American Dictionary&quot; in 1859. The Pictorial Edition was basically a reprint of the 1847 &quot;American Dictionary&quot;, with engravings taken from the Imperial Dictionary of the English Language. More competition arrived in the form of the Merriam&#x27;s revised edition of Webster&#x27;s &quot;American Dictionary&quot;, which appeared in 1864. Worcester&#x27;s dictionary was posthumously revised in 1886, but was eclipsed by &quot;Webster&#x27;s International&quot; and other dictionaries of the 1890s.

===Marriage and family===
In 1841 he married Amy Elizabeth McKean; the couple had no children. McKean, daughter of the founder of Harvard College&#x27;s Porcellian Club, had previously served as a teacher after taking over the post of Sophia Ripley.

Around this time, Worcester was living in the Craigie House in Cambridge, Massachusetts, renting rooms from the widow of Andrew Craigie, first apothecary general of the United States. When Mrs. Craigie died, Worcester rented out the entire house from her heirs and subleased rooms to the poet and professor Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. In 1843, after the house was purchased by Nathan Appleton on Longfellow&#x27;s behalf, Worcester rented a portion of the house from Longfellow until the construction of his own home a few doors down was completed that spring. The home is still standing at 121 Brattle Street in Cambridge.

===Death===

Worcester died on October 27, 1865. He is interred at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The historian Howard Jackson notes it was not until Worcester&#x27;s death that the &quot;dictionary war&quot; was finally over.

==Critical response and legacy==

Unlike Webster, Worcester adhered to British pronunciation and spellings, calling them &quot;better&quot;, &quot;more accurate&quot;, &quot;more harmonious and agreeable&quot;. He opposed Webster&#x27;s phonetic spelling reforms (e.g. &quot;tuf&quot; for &quot;tough&quot;, &quot;&quot; for &quot;daughter&quot;), to Webster&#x27;s disapproval. The 20th century lexicographer and scholar James Sledd noted that the commercial rivalry between the two attracted significant public interest in lexicography and dictionaries. It was not until 1864, when the much-improved &quot;Webster-Mahn Dictionary&quot;, which completely revised etymologies, was published, that the Worcester dictionary was outsold in the American marketplace.

Worcester sent a copy of one of his dictionaries to the author Washington Irving, who predicted it would be used &quot;to supply the wants of common schools&quot;. Though Webster&#x27;s dictionary was the more popular, Worcester&#x27;s book proved to be a favorite among writers. Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. wrote that the book was one &quot;on which, as is well known, the literary men of this metropolis are by special statute allowed to be sworn in place of the Bible.&quot; Edward Everett Hale wrote of the 1860 &quot;Dictionary of the English Language&quot;: &quot;We have at last a good dictionary.&quot;

<text>John VIII of Constantinople (; 1010 – 2 August 1075), a native of Trebizond, was a Byzantine intellectual, jurist, and Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from 1064 to 1075. He was the uncle of John Xiphilinus, the Epimator. He is considered &quot;an innovator in the field of the methodology of jurisprudential research&quot;.

== Early career ==
John was born in Trebizond to the Xiphilinos family. He pursued studies at the University of Constantinople and eventually became &quot;nomophylax&quot; of its School of Law. Later he became a monk and was eventually selected by Emperor Constantine X Doukas (1059–1067) to succeed Constantine III of Constantinople as the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.

== Episcopacy ==
In 1072, John VIII presided over an assembly of metropolitans and archbishops at the oratory of Saint Alexius in which the question of the election of bishops to vacant sees was discussed. Michael I of Constantinople had forbidden metropolitans who were resident in Constantinople from participating in such elections. John, however, recognised that metropolitans sometimes had to remain for a long period in the capital due to ecclesiastical business or illness. The assembly with John&#x27;s consent decreed that metropolitans who gave the patriarch advance notification of their intent could again vote while resident in Constantinople. After his death, his remains were buried at the monastery of Angourion on 2 August 1075.

John VIII wrote a hagiography of Saint Eugenios of Trebizond.

John VIII has been canonised in the Eastern Orthodox Church and his feast day is celebrated on 30 August.

<doc id="750220" wikidata="Q469731" url="?curid=750220" title="Sviatoslav II of Kiev">
<text>Sviatoslav II Iaroslavich or Sviatoslav II Yaroslavich (; 1027 – 27 December 1076) was Grand Prince of Kiev from 1073 until his death in 1076. He was a younger son of Yaroslav the Wise, the grand prince of Kiev. He is the progenitor of the &quot;Sviatoslavichi&quot; branch of Rurikids.

He ruled the Principality of Vladimir in Volhynia in his father&#x27;s lifetime (from around 1040 to 1054). Yaroslav the Wise, who divided the Kievan Rus&#x27; among his five sons in his testament, willed the Principality of Chernigov to Sviatoslav. Sviatoslav joined his brothers, Iziaslav of Kiev and Vsevolod of Pereyaslav, in forming a princely &quot;triumvirate&quot; that oversaw the affairs of Kievan Rus&#x27; until 1072. The three brothers together fought against their enemies, including the nomadic Oghuz Turks, and their distant relative, Prince Vseslav of Polotsk. The Cumans defeated their united force in the autumn of 1068, but Sviatoslav routed a Cuman band plundering his principality.

The &quot;triumvirate&quot; broke up, when Sviatoslav, supported by his younger brother Vsevolod, dethroned and replaced their older brother Iziaslav in 1073. He commissioned the compilation of at least two miscellanies of theological works. Otherwise, his short reign was uneventful.

==Early life==
Sviatoslav was the fourth son of Yaroslav the Wise, Grand Prince of Kiev, and his wife, Ingegerd of Sweden. He was born in 1027. The &quot;Lyubetskiy sinodik&quot;a list of the princes of Chernigov which was completed in the Monastery of Saint Anthony in Lyubechwrites that his baptismal name was Nicholas.

The &quot;Russian Primary Chronicle&quot; writes that Sviatoslav was staying &quot;at Vladimir&quot; in Volhynia around the time his father fell seriously ill before his death. According to the historian Martin Dimnik, the chronicle&#x27;s report shows that Yaroslav the Wise had, most probably in about 1040, appointed Sviatoslav to rule this important town of the Kievan Rus&#x27;.

On his deathbed, Yaroslav the Wise divided the most important towns of his realm among his five sonsIziaslav, Sviatoslav, Vsevolod, Igor, and Vyacheslavwho survived him. To Sviatoslav, he bequeathed Chernigov. The dying grand prince also ordered that his four younger sons should &quot;heed&quot; their eldest brother, Iziaslav, who received Kiev.

==Triumvirate==

Yaroslav the Wise died on 20 February 1054. His three elder sonsIziaslav of Kiev, Sviatoslav of Chernigov, and Vsevolod of Pereyaslavdecided to jointly govern the Kievan Rus&#x27;. Historian Martin Dimnik writes that taking into account Sviatoslav&#x27;s political and military skills it &quot;is reasonable to assume that he was one of the main motivating forces, if not the actual architect, of many of the policies adopted&quot; by the three brothers. The &quot;triumviri&quot; closely cooperated in the following years. In 1059 they liberated their uncle Sudislav, whom their father had sent to prison around 1035. They made a joint expedition &quot;by horse and ship against the Torks&quot; or Oghuz Turks, according to the &quot;Russian Primary Chronicle&quot;, in 1060. On hearing of the arrival of the Rus&#x27; forces, the Torks fled from their lands without resistance.

In 1065, Sviatoslav led his troops against his nephew, Rostislav Vladimirovich, who had in the previous year forcibly expelled Sviatoslav&#x27;s son, Gleb, from Tmutorakan. Upon Sviatoslav&#x27;s arrival, Rostislav withdrew from this important center of his uncle&#x27;s domains, but he reoccupied it after Sviatoslav had returned to Chernigov. A distant cousin of the &quot;triumviri&quot;, Vseslav Briacheslavich (Prince of Polotsk), attacked Pskov in 1065, according to &quot;The Chronicle of Pskov&quot;. Vseslav Briacheslavich could not take this town, but he seized and plundered Novgorodwhich had been ruled by Iziaslav of Kiev&#x27;s son, Mstislavin the next winter. Izyaslav, Sviatoslav and Vsevolod soon united their forces and set forth against Vseslav, &quot;though it was the dead of winter&quot;, according to the &quot;Russian Primary Chronicle&quot;. They routed Vseslav&#x27;s army by the Nemiga River (near Minsk) on 3 March 1066. Vseslav, who fled from the battlefield, agreed to enter into negotiations with the &quot;triumviri&quot;, but they treacherously captured him at a meeting at Orsha in early June.

The Cumans, who had emerged as the dominant power of the Pontic steppes in the early 1060s, invaded the southern regions of Kievan Rus&#x27; in 1068. The three brothers together marched against the invaders, but the Cumans routed them on the Alta River. From the battlefield, Sviatoslav withdrew to Chernigov and regrouped his troops. He returned to defeat the Cumans with a smaller force at the town of Snovsk on 1 November at the Battle of Snovsk, thus enhancing his prestige among the populace. In the meantime, the townspeople of Kiev had dethroned and expelled Sviatoslav&#x27;s brother, Iziaslav. Taking advantage of Iziaslav&#x27;s absence, Sviatoslav sent his own son, Gleb, to Novgorod to rule the town.

Iziaslav returned at the head of Polish reinforcements. The townspeople of Kiev sent messages to Sviatoslav and Vsevolod, imploring them to come to their &quot;father&#x27;s city&quot; and defend it, according to the &quot;Russian Primary Chronicle&quot;. Sviatoslav and Vsevolod requested Iziaslav &quot;not to lead the Poles in attack upon Kiev&quot;, stating that &quot;if he intended to nurse his wrath and destroy the city, they would be properly concerned for the ancestral capital&quot;. Iziaslav partially acquiesced: he did not let his Polish allies enter the town, but his retinue slaughtered or mutilated many of his opponents in Kiev. He also attempted to punish Anthonythe founder of the Monastery of the Caves in Kievwho had supported his enemies, but Sviatoslav gave shelter to the saintly monk in Chernigov.

With Iziaslav&#x27;s return to Kiev, the &quot;triumvirate&quot; was restored. The three brothers together visited Vyshhorod in order to participate in the translation of the relics of their saintly uncles, Boris and Gleb, on 3 May 1072. According to &quot;The Narrative, Passion, and Encomium of Boris and Gleb&quot;, Sviatoslav took Saint Gleb&#x27;s hand and &quot;pressed it to his injury, for he had pain in his neck, and to his eyes, and to his forehead&quot; before placing it back into the coffin. In short order, Sviatoslav felt a pain at the top of his head and his servant found a fingernail of the saint under his cap. Most historians agree that the three brothers expanded their father&#x27;s legal code on this occasion, but the exact date is unknown. 

==Grand Prince of Kiev==

According to the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, &quot;the devil stirred up strife&quot; among the three brothers shortly after the canonization of Saints Boris and Gleb. Sviatoslav and Vsevolod united their forces and expelled Iziaslav from Kiev on 22 March 1073. The chronicler put the blame for this action on Sviatoslav, stating that &quot;he was the instigator of his brother&#x27;s expulsion, for he desired more power&quot;. The chronicler also states that Sviatoslav had &quot;misled Vsevolod by asserting that&quot; Iziaslav &quot;was entering into an alliance&quot; with Vseslav Briacheslavich against them. Modern historians disagree about the motives of Sviatoslav&#x27;s action. Franklin and Shepard write that he was driven by &quot;straightforward greed&quot;; Martin says that Sviatoslav who seems to have suffered from a grave illness wanted to secure his sons&#x27; right to Kiev which would have been lost if Sviatoslav &quot;had predeceased Iziaslav without having ruled&quot; the town. In fact, the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; states that it was Sviatoslav who &quot;ruled in Kiev after the expulsion&quot; of Iziaslav.

Initially, the head of the Monastery of the Caves, Feodosy criticized Sviatoslav for usurping the throne. However, before his death in May 1074 he was reconciled with the grand prince, who supported the foundation of a stone church dedicated to the Mother of God in Kiev. Sviatoslav also supported the compilation of ecclesiastic works. Two &quot;izborniki&quot; or miscellaniescollections of excerpts from the Bible and from theological workswere completed under his auspices in 1073 and 1076. According to the &quot;Izbornik of 1073&quot;, Sviatoslav, who is praised as a &quot;new Ptolemy&quot;, had by that time collected a great number of spiritual books.

Sviatoslav&#x27;s rule was short and uneventful. His dethroned brother first fled to Poland, but Duke Bolesław II, who was Sviatoslav&#x27;s son-in-law, expelled him from his lands. Next Iziaslav sought the assistance of the German monarch, Henry IV. The latter, in 1075, sent his envoysincluding Sviatoslav&#x27;s brother-in-law, Burchardto Kiev to collect more information. According to the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, &quot;in his pride&quot;, Sviatoslav &quot;showed them his riches&quot;, displaying them &quot;the innumerable quantity of his gold, silver and silks&quot;. In 1076 Sviatoslav sent reinforcements to Poland to help his son-in-law against the Bohemians.

Sviatoslav died on 27 December 1076. The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; writes that &quot;the cutting of a sore&quot; caused his death. He was buried in the Holy Savior Cathedral in Chernigov. Within a year, his elder brother Iziaslav was restored and Sviatoslav&#x27;s sons lost most parts of his domains.

==Ancestry==

According to the &quot;Lyubetskiy sinodik&quot;, Sviatoslav&#x27;s wife was Killikiya or Kelikia (Cecilia). On the other hand, German chroniclers write that his wife was Oda of Stade, a sister of Burchard, the Provost of Trier, and she gave birth to one son. A portrait depicting Sviatoslav and his family in the &quot;Izbornik of 1073&quot; shows that he had five sons and four of them were adults at the time their portrait was made. Based on these sources, Sviatoslav married twice.

According to Dimnik, Sviatoslav married his first wife, Killikiya, between 1043 and 1047. Their first child seems to have been a daughter, Vysheslava. Her eldest brother Gleb became prince of Tmutorakan and later of Novgorod. The second son of Sviatoslav and Killikiya was Oleg, the future prince of Chernigov. Davyd, the future prince of Novgorod and Chernigov, was born around 1051. Roman, who became prince of Tmutorakan, was born around 1052.

Sviatoslav married his second wife, Oda of Stade, in about 1065, according to Dimnik. Oda, the daughter of Lothair Udo I, Margrave of the Nordmark, was in some way related to Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor. She gave birth to Sviatoslav&#x27;s fifth son, Yaroslav, who later became prince of Murom and Chernigov. After Sviatoslav&#x27;s death, Oda and her son moved to the Holy Roman Empire.

<text>John Lorimer Worden (March 12, 1818 – October 19, 1897) was a U.S. Navy officer in the American Civil War, who took part in the Battle of Hampton Roads, the first-ever engagement between ironclad steamships at Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 9 March 1862.

Commanding the Union&#x27;s only warship of this class, , Worden challenged the Confederate vessel &quot;Virginia&quot;, a converted steam-frigate that had sunk two Union blockaders and damaged two others. After a four-hour battle, both ships withdrew, unable to pierce the other&#x27;s armour.

==Background and early career==
Worden was born in Scarborough, New York. He grew up in Swartwoutville , Dutchess County, New York, and was married to Olivia Toffey, the aunt of Daniel Toffey, captain&#x27;s clerk of the USS &quot;Monitor&quot;. He was appointed midshipman in the Navy on January 10, 1834. He served his first three years in the sloop-of-war &quot;Erie&quot; on the Brazil Station. Following that, he was briefly assigned to the sloop before he reported to the Naval School at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for seven months of instruction. He returned to sea in July 1840 for two years with the Pacific Squadron.

Between 1844 and 1846, Worden was stationed at the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. During the Mexican–American War, he cruised the west coast, primarily in the store ship &quot;Southampton&quot;, but in other ships as well. In 1850, he returned to the Naval Observatory for another two-year tour of duty. The ensuing nine years were filled with sea duty which took Worden on several cruises in the Caribbean and Mediterranean Seas.

==Civil War service==

Brought to Washington early in 1861, he received orders in April to carry secret dispatches—regarding the reinforcement of Fort Pickens—south to the warships at Pensacola. During the return journey north, Worden was arrested near Montgomery, Alabama, and was held prisoner until being exchanged about seven months later.

===Taking command of the &quot;Monitor&quot;===
Though still ill as a result of his imprisonment, Lieutenant Worden accepted orders to command the new ironclad &quot;Monitor&quot; on January 16, 1862. He reported to her building site at Greenpoint in Brooklyn on Long Island and supervised her completion. He placed the new warship in commission at the New York Navy Yard on February 25 and two days later sailed for Hampton Roads. However, steering failure forced the ironclad back to New York for repairs. On March 6, she headed south again, this time under tow by &quot;Seth Low&quot;.

On the afternoon of March 8, &quot;Monitor&quot; approached Cape Henry, Virginia, while inside Hampton Roads, the Confederacy&#x27;s own ironclad, CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;, wrought havoc with the Union Navy&#x27;s wooden blockading fleet. During that engagement, the Southern warship sank both the sloop and the frigate , as well as severely damaging the steam frigate before retiring behind Sewell&#x27;s Point. Arriving on the scene too late to participate in the engagement, Worden and his ship set about assisting the grounded &quot;Minnesota&quot;.

===The battle of the ironclads===
At daybreak on the 9th, &quot;Virginia&quot; emerged once more from behind Sewell&#x27;s Point to complete her reduction of the Federal fleet at Hampton Roads. As the Confederate ironclad approached &quot;Minnesota&quot;, Worden maneuvered &quot;Monitor&quot; from the grounded ship&#x27;s shadow to engage &quot;Virginia&quot; in the battle that revolutionized naval warfare. For four hours, the two iron-plated ships slugged it out as they maneuvered in the narrow channel of Hampton Roads, pouring shot and shell at one another to almost no visible effect. Three hours into the slugfest, Worden received facial wounds when a Confederate shell exploded just outside the pilot house that partially blinded him. He relinquished command to his first officer, Samuel D. Greene. About an hour later, &quot;Monitor&quot; withdrew from the battle temporarily and, upon her return to the scene, found that &quot;Virginia&quot;, too, had withdrawn. The first battle between steam-driven, armored ships had ended in a draw.
===Other wartime commands===
After the battle, Worden moved ashore to convalesce from his wounds. During that recuperative period, he received the accolade of a grateful nation, the official thanks of the United States Congress, and promotion to commander. Late in 1862, he took command of the ironclad monitor &quot;Montauk&quot; and placed her in commission at New York on December 14, 1862. Later in the month, Worden took his new ship south to join the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron off Port Royal, South Carolina. On January 27, 1863, he led his ship in the bombardment of Fort McAllister. A month later, newly promoted Captain Worden took his ship into the Ogeechee River, found the Confederate privateer &quot;Rattlesnake&quot; (formerly CSS &quot;Nashville&quot;), and destroyed her with five well-placed shots. His last action came of April 7, 1863, when &quot;Montauk&quot; participated in an attack on Charleston, South Carolina.

==Post-war career and last years==
Not long after the Charleston attack, Capt. Worden received orders to shore duty in conjunction with the construction of ironclads in New York. That assignment lasted until the late 1860s. He was promoted to commodore in May 1868. In 1869, Commodore Worden began a five-year tour as Superintendent of the United States Naval Academy. In 1872, Worden was promoted to rear admiral. In 1873 he became the first president of the United States Naval Institute.

During the late 1870s, he commanded the European Squadron, visiting ports in northern Europe and patrolling the eastern Mediterranean during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78. He returned ashore and concluded his naval career as a member of the Examining Board and as President of the Retiring Board. When he retired on December 23, 1886, Congress voted him full sea pay in his grade for life.

Admiral Worden was a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, Sons of the American Revolution, Naval Order of the United States and the Military Order of Foreign Wars.

Rear Admiral Worden resided in Washington, D.C., until his death from pneumonia on October 19, 1897. After funeral services at St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Washington, he was buried in the Pawling Cemetery in Pawling, New York. He was married to Olivia Toffey (1820–1903), and she and three of their four children survived him. His oldest son was John Lorimer Worden, Jr. (1845–1873), who served as a volunteer captain in the U.S. Army during the Civil War and later as a first lieutenant in the regular army until his death in 1873. The second son was Daniel Toffey Worden (1847–1914), a Wall Street stock broker. Worden also had two daughters, Grace Worden (1852–1905) and Olivia Steele Worden (1856–1933). Worden&#x27;s widow and all of his children except Daniel were buried with him in Pawling, New York.

==Tiffany &amp; Co. sword==

After the battle of the &quot;Monitor&quot; and &quot;Virginia&quot; the state of New York celebrated their hero with the commissioning of a custom-made gold-and-silver inlaid sword from Tiffany &amp; Co. The handle was emblazoned with the Roman god of the sea, Neptune, and included a gold-plated sheath and gold embroidered belt made at the cost of $550. ($16,128 adjusted for inflation as of 2022.)

In 1912, fifteen years after his death, Worden&#x27;s family donated the sword to the Naval Academy, where it rested until 1931, when it was stolen. The subsequent naval investigation yielded no leads.

The sword was missing for over six decades until 1998, when the FBI began an investigation into several dealers of the PBS show &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;. By 2002, three men were in jail for $1 million in memorabilia fraud. The FBI continued to delve further into the records of the appraisers, searching for more stolen items. The sword had been purchased by an appraiser and then resold to a collector. After the FBI verified the sword was stolen, it was confiscated and returned to the Naval Academy.

==Namesake==
Fort Worden, located in Port Townsend, Washington, and four United States Navy ships have been named USS &quot;Worden&quot; for him. The parade field at the United States Naval Academy is named in his honor. The John L. Worden Camp 150, Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War, is based in Peekskill, New York, not far from Worden&#x27;s grave in Pawling, New York.

<text>Simple public key infrastructure (SPKI, pronounced &quot;spoo-key&quot;) was an attempt to overcome the complexity of traditional X.509 public key infrastructure. It was specified in two Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comments (RFC) specifications – and – from the IETF SPKI working group. These two RFCs never passed the &quot;experimental&quot; maturity level of the IETF&#x27;s RFC status. The SPKI specification defined an authorization certificate format, providing for the delineation of privileges, rights or other such attributes (called authorizations) and binding them to a public key. In 1996, SPKI was merged with Simple Distributed Security Infrastructure (SDSI, pronounced &quot;sudsy&quot;) by Ron Rivest and Butler Lampson.

== History and overview ==
The original SPKI had identified principals only as public keys but allowed binding authorizations to those keys and delegation of authorization from one key to another. The encoding used was attribute:value pairing, similar to headers.

The original SDSI bound local names (of individuals or groups) to public keys (or other names), but carried authorization only in Access Control Lists (ACLs) and did not allow for delegation of subsets of a principal&#x27;s authorization. The encoding used was standard S-expression. Sample RSA public key in SPKI in &quot;advanced transport format&quot; (for actual transport the structure would be Base64-encoded):
(public-key
   (rsa-pkcs1-md5
    (e #03#)
    (n
     |ANHCG85jXFGmicr3MGPj53FYYSY1aWAue6PKnpFErHhKMJa4HrK4WSKTO
     YTTlapRznnELD2D7lWd3Q8PD0lyi1NJpNzMkxQVHrrAnIQoczeOZuiz/yY
     VDzJ1DdiImixyb/Jyme3D0UiUXhd6VGAz0x0cgrKefKnmjy410Kro3uW1| )))
The combined SPKI/SDSI allows the naming of principals, creation of named groups of principals and the delegation of rights or other attributes from one principal to another. It includes a language for expression of authorization – a language that includes a definition of &quot;intersection&quot; of authorizations. It also includes the notion of threshold subject – a construct granting authorizations (or delegations) only when &quot;K&quot; of &quot;N&quot; of the listed subjects concur (in a request for access or a delegation of rights). SPKI/SDSI uses S-expression encoding, but specifies a binary form that is extremely easy to parse – an LR(0) grammar – called Canonical S-expressions.

SPKI/SDSI does not define a role for a commercial certificate authority (CA). In fact, one premise behind SPKI is that a commercial CA serves no useful purpose.
As a result of that, SPKI/SDSI is deployed primarily in closed solutions and in demonstration projects of academic interest. Another side-effect of this design element is that it is difficult to monetize SPKI/SDSI by itself. It can be a component of some other product, but there is no business case for developing SPKI/SDSI tools and services except as part of some other product.

The most prominent general deployments of SPKI/SDSI are E-speak, a middleware product from HP that used SPKI/SDSI for access control of web methods, and UPnP Security, that uses an XML dialect of SPKI/SDSI for access control of web methods, delegation of rights among network participants, etc.

<text>Hubert Work (July 3, 1860December 14, 1942) was a U.S. administrator and physician. He served as the United States Postmaster General from 1922 until 1923 during the presidency of Warren G. Harding. He served as the United States Secretary of the Interior from 1923 until 1928 during the administrations of Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge.

==Early life and career==
Work was born in Marion Center, Pennsylvania, to Tabitha Van Horn and Moses Thompson Work. He attended medical school at the University of Michigan from 1882 to 1883 and received an M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1885. He settled in Colorado and founded Woodcroft Hospital in Pueblo, Colorado, in 1896.

Work was active in the Republican Party and served as the Colorado state chairman in 1912. In 1914, Work ran unsuccessfully in a special election for the United States Senate. He was defeated by Democrat Charles S. Thomas, later the governor of Colorado.

Work received 98,728 votes (39 percent) compared to Thomas&#x27; 102,037 ballots (40.3 percent). This was Colorado&#x27;s first Senate election by popular vote under the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. During World War I, Work served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps and attained the rank of lieutenant colonel.

From 1921 to 1922, Work served as the president of the American Medical Association. He was the Colorado delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1920 and was chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1928 to 1929.

Work served as the U.S. Assistant Postmaster General from 1921 to 1922, and as the U.S. Postmaster General from 1922 to 1923 under President Harding. He served as the U.S. Secretary of the Interior from 1923 to 1928, under the administrations of President Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge. During Work&#x27;s tenure as the Secretary of the Interior, American citizenship was formally granted to the Native Americans in the United States. He resigned from the Department of the Interior on July 24, 1928, and was replaced by Roy O. West. He was the first physician to serve in the U.S. Cabinet.

==Personal life==
In 1887, Work married Laura M. Arbuckle (18591924), with whom he had three children: Philip, Dorcas &quot;Doris&quot; Logan, and Robert Van Horn Work. Work&#x27;s first wife died and he married the former Ethel Reed Gano in 1933.

Work died in Denver, Colorado, on December 14, 1942. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, next to his first wife.

<doc id="750243" wikidata="Q60777" url="?curid=750243" title="Manfred Wörner">
<text>Manfred Hermann Wörner (24 September 1934 – 13 August 1994) was a German politician and diplomat. He served as the defense minister of West Germany between 1982 and 1988. He then served as the seventh Secretary General of NATO from 1988 to 1994. His term as Secretary General saw the end of the Cold War and the German reunification. Whilst serving in that position, he was diagnosed with cancer, but, in spite of his illness, continued serving until his final days.

== Family ==
He grew up in his grandfather&#x27;s house in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt and attended the Johannes-Kepler-Gymnasium there. He was married to Elfie Wörner, who was supporting several German army related humanitarian agencies, and who died of a tumor on 4 July 2006.

== Education ==
After graduation in 1953 he studied law at Heidelberg, Paris, and Munich. He closed his studies 1957 with the first and 1961 the second Staatsexamen. He got his Dr. jur. in 1961 writing about International law. Afterwards he worked for the administration of Baden-Württemberg. He was a county official for Oehringen until 1962, for the Baden-Württemberg Landtag until 1965 and the County Göppingen. Wörner was a jet pilot and reserve officer in the Luftwaffe.

== Political career ==
Wörner was a member of the German CDU and was elected to the German parliament, representing Göppingen.

On 4 October 1982 he was appointed Federal Minister of Defence in Helmut Kohl&#x27;s government. Wörner played an important role in defending NATO&#x27;s decision to deploy intermediate-range ballistic missiles IRBM after arms reduction talks with the Soviet Union to reverse Soviet deployment of its SS-20 intermediate-range ballistic missiles IRBM from the years before.

In 1983, Wörner faced criticism due to the scandal surrounding German General Günter Kießling. The German military secret service had accused Kießling of being homosexual—this was later revealed to be a case of mistaken identity—and Wörner had ordered Kießling&#x27;s early retirement, as homosexuality was considered a security risk at the time. Kießling insisted on disciplinary procedures against himself and eventually achieved his reinstatement. Wörner accepted political responsibility for the affair and on 18 May 1984 offered his resignation, which was rejected by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

==Secretary-General of NATO (1988-1994)==
In December 1987, the 16 members of NATO elected Wörner Secretary General. He was the first German to be appointed to that position. Resigning from his post in the German government, he took office on 1 July 1988.

An address given by Wörner in 1990 to the Bremer Tabak Collegium became a subject of a controversy when Vladimir Putin cited it in his 2007 speech at 43rd Munich Conference on Security Policy to claim that NATO made a promise not to expand eastward after the end of the Cold War.

Wörner executed his duties as NATO Secretary General despite severe illness and until his death from colorectal cancer in 1994. He is buried at the cemetery of Hohenstaufen nearby Göppingen.

== Personal life ==
In December 1972 Wörner married Anna-Maria Caesar. From 1982 until his death he was married with Elfie Wörner, née Reinsch (1941–2006).

== Medal ==
Since 1996, the Ministry of Defense has awarded the Manfred Wörner Medal on an annual basis to honour public figures who have rendered &quot;special meritorious service to peace and freedom in Europe&quot;.

Since then it was given to:
* 1996 Richard Holbrooke, US diplomat and Special Envoy in Bosnia and Kosovo
* 1997 Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist-Schmenzin, publisher and initiator of the Munich Conference on Security Policy
* 1998 Dr. Gerd Wagner (postmortem), for the implementation of the Dayton Agreement
* 1999 Dr. Janusz Onyszkiewicz, Minister of Defense of Poland
* 2000 Elizabeth Pond, American Journalist
* 2001 Karsten Voigt, Coordinator at the German State Department for the German-American Cooperation
* 2002 Javier Solana, the European Union&#x27;s foreign policy chief and former Secretary General of NATO
* 2003 Prof. Dr. Catherine McArdle Kelleher, U.S. Naval War College and former Head of the Aspen Institute Berlin
* 2005 Hans Koschnick
* 2006 Christian Schwarz-Schilling
* 2007 Martti Ahtisaari
* 2009 Jörg Schönbohm
* 2011 Hans-Friedrich von Ploetz, German diplomat

== Honours ==
The Manfred-Wörner-Seminar, a security-policy information seminar of the German Federal Ministry of Defense for young civilian executive personnel from Germany, the United States and other European nations, is named after Manfred Wörner to honour his merits on transatlantic dialogue and understanding.

Wörner Gap on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Dr. Wörner in recognition of his contribution to European unification.

<text>Samantha Smith (born 27 November 1971) is an English former professional tennis player, who was the British ladies&#x27; No. 1 from 1996 to 1999. She now commentates on the game, predominantly for the BBC, ITV, Sky Sports, BT Sport, Eurosport &amp; Amazon Prime and for 17 consecutive years since 2009 in Australia on the Australian Open for the Seven Network and since 2019 the Nine Network.

==Early life==
Smith was born in Epping, Essex and was educated at Bancroft&#x27;s School. She took three years out of tennis to attend the University of Exeter where she attained an upper second class Honours degree in history.

==Tennis career==
Smith competed on the WTA Tour from 1990 to 1992 and from 1995 to 2000. Her highest achievement was in reaching the fourth round at the Wimbledon Championships in 1998, when she beat Anne-Gaëlle Sidot, Mariana Díaz Oliva and former champion Conchita Martínez before losing to eventual runner up Nathalie Tauziat. In so doing she picked up an ankle injury that required her to have two operations and spend four months in plaster; this effectively ended her career. She peaked at No. 55 in the WTA rankings before the injury curtailed her climb up the rankings.

At the Australian Open, she competed in the first round of the women&#x27;s doubles competition in 1992 (with Ilana Berger), and reached the second round in 1999.

At the French Open at Roland Garros, she competed in the first round in 1991 and 1999.

At Wimbledon, she competed eight times and reached the fourth round in 1998.
At the US Open, she competed in the first round in 1998 and reached the second round in 1997.
At the 1992 Barcelona Olympics she reached the second round.

Smith won a silver medal in the mixed doubles at the 1995 Universiade (World University Games) in Fukuoka, Japan, partnering Paul Robinson. She also reached the quarterfinals in the singles.

She won the ITF tournaments at Nottingham in 1995 (singles and doubles) and Frinton-on-Sea in 2000. She represented Britain in the Fed Cup and European Cup in 1991 and from 1996 to 1999. She was unbeaten in her five singles matches in the 1997 Fed Cup.

<text>William Wallace Wotherspoon (November 16, 1850 – October 21, 1921) was a United States Army general who served as Chief of Staff of the United States Army in 1914.

==Early life==
Wotherspoon was born in Washington, D.C., on November 16, 1850, the son of Army surgeon Alexander Summerville Wotherspoon (1817–1884) and Louisa Kuhn Wotherspoon. Alexander Wotherspoon was a veteran of the Mexican War; in addition to serving on Winfield Scott&#x27;s staff, he was present when President Zachary Taylor became ill in 1850, and treated Taylor during his final illness.

William Wotherspoon was educated in private schools and served as a mate in the United States Navy from March 9, 1870 to October 9, 1873 aboard the screw sloop of war USS &quot;Plymouth&quot; and the paddle steamer USS &quot;Tallapoosa&quot;. He resigned from the Navy to accept a commission in the U.S. Army.

==Army career==
Wotherspoon was commissioned a second lieutenant and assigned to the 12th Infantry in October 1873. From 1874 to 1881, he served in the West during the Indian wars as a troop officer and quartermaster.

After a year of absence from the Army for being sick, he became the superintendent and did much needed work to expand the Soldiers&#x27; Home in Washington, D.C. He then served at Fort Sully and at Mount Vernon Barracks, where he trained a company of Apache prisoners from 1890 to 1894. In 1893 he became an hereditary member of the Aztec Club of 1847.

In 1894, he became aide to General Oliver O. Howard, commander of the Department of the East, and was the Rhode Island College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (today named the University of Rhode Island) first Professor Military Science and Tactics from 1894 to 1898.

===Spanish–American War===
In 1898, while on recruiting duty at Fort McPherson, he organized the 3rd Battalion, 12th Infantry. He served in the Philippines against insurgents and as collector of customs at Iloilo from 1899 to 1901 under the command of Colonel Edmund Rice.

===Senior command===

In 1901, he was promoted to major and transferred to the 30th Infantry. He commanded the 2nd Battalion, 6th Infantry at Fort Leavenworth and then taught at the Command and General Staff College from 1902 to 1904. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel and assigned to the 14th Infantry in 1904 and later was transferred to the 19th Infantry and became the director of the U.S. Army War College from 1904 to 1906. Wotherspoon was the chief of staff of the Army of Cuban Pacification from 1906 to 1907.

Wotherspoon served as the acting president of the Army War College and chief of the Third Division, General Staff in 1907. He was promoted to brigadier general in October 1907, advanced over 140 officers with more seniority. He was president of the Army War College, serving from 1907 to 1909 and again from 1910 to 1912. Wotherspoon was largely instrumental in transforming the Army War College from an adjunct of the General Staff to an autonomous educational institution, he became assistant to the chief of staff from 1901 to 1910 and again in 1912 to 1914. He was promoted to major general in May 1912 and served as the commander of the Department of the Gulf until that September.

===Army Chief of Staff===
Wotherspoon became the Chief of Staff of the United States Army in 1914; he served from April 21 to November 15. During his term, he highlighted the shortage of experienced officers and noncommissioned as the Army began to prepare for possible involvement in World War I. He also emphasized the need to improve coastal defenses to match battleships that were increasing in size and armament, oversaw establishment of the Army&#x27;s first aviation section as a branch of the Signal Corps, and completion of the Panama Canal and its opening to ship traffic.

==Retirement==
Wotherspoon retired upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 64 on November 16, 1914 After retiring, he was New York State Superintendent of Public Works from 1915 to 1920.

Wotherspoon died in Washington, D.C. on October 21, 1921. He was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery, Section 3, Site 1949.

In 1893 Wotherspoon became a representative member of the Aztec Club of 1847 by right of his father&#x27;s service in the Mexican War.

==Family==
In 1887, while stationed in northern New York, he married Mary C. Adams (1865–1953) of Utica, New York. They were the parents of a son, Alexander Somerville Wotherspoon (1892–1976). Alexander Wotherspoon was a career officer in the United States Navy, and retired as a rear admiral.

<doc id="750254" wikidata="Q689947" url="?curid=750254" title="American Pie (Don McLean album)">
<text>American Pie is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Don McLean, released by United Artists Records in October 1971. The folk rock album reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, containing the chart-topping singles &quot;American Pie&quot; and &quot;Vincent&quot;. Recorded in May and June 1971 at The Record Plant in New York City, the LP is dedicated to Buddy Holly, and was reissued in 1980 minus the track &quot;Sister Fatima&quot;. The album was released to much acclaim, later being included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

At the Australian 1972 King of Pop Awards the album won Most Popular Overseas L.P.

==Background==
&quot;American Pie&quot; is McLean’s second album; his first, &quot;Tapestry&quot;, having been released to only moderate commercial success and acclaim in 1970. McLean was a protégé of Pete Seeger, having played with him in the 1960s. The album &quot;American Pie&quot; was intended as a unified work, as McLean has said that he was influenced by the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt Pepper&quot; album and envisioned &quot;American Pie&quot; to be a similar album. Believing that an artist&#x27;s work should stand by itself, McLean generally did not offer explanations for his work&#x27;s themes or meaning, though he did describe the title song as involving &quot;a sense of loss&quot;. McLean dedicated the album to Buddy Holly, one of his childhood icons, and it was released in 1971. It has a melancholy feel and rather sparse arrangements. At the time of the writing McLean’s first marriage was failing and the optimism and hopefulness of the 1960s was giving way to the nihilism and hedonism of the 1970s.

==Production==
The album was recorded in Studio A at The Record Plant on West 44th street in New York City. The producer, Ed Freeman, decided to use accomplished musicians who were not &quot;studio musicians who could act like a metronome&quot; because he wanted to capture the feel of a &quot;band that was really cooking,&quot; so he rented a rehearsal studio and they rehearsed the title song for two weeks before they recorded it. Because McLean rarely phrased his singing the same way twice there were as many as 24 takes for some of the voice parts, but the rhythm tracks are mostly one take.

The original United Artists Records inner sleeve featured a free verse poem written by McLean about William Boyd, also known as Hopalong Cassidy, along with a picture of Boyd in full Hopalong regalia. The words to this poem appear on a plaque at the hospital where Boyd died. The Boyd poem and picture tribute do appear on a special remastered 2003 CD.

The title track contains references to the death of Buddy Holly (McLean being a 13-year-old paper-boy at the time). The phrase &quot;The Day the Music Died&quot; was used by McLean on this song, and has now become an unofficial name for the tragedy.

On the original release, the title of the song &quot;Sister Fatima&quot; is misspelled &quot;Sister Faima&quot; 

The final track, &quot;Babylon&quot;, is a close paraphrase of the 1st Verse of the 137th Psalm. It is based on the canon &quot;By the Waters of Babylon&quot; by Philip Hayes, originally published in 1786.

== Back-up singers ==
The final chorus of &quot;American Pie&quot; features multi-tracked overdubs, credited in the sleeve notes to the &quot;West Forty Fourth Street Rhythm and Noise Choir&quot;. Although the individual choristers have never been publicly named, the album&#x27;s producer, Ed Freeman, has claimed that the choir included Pete Seeger, James Taylor, Livingston Taylor and Carly Simon.

==Release and reception==
The album reached number 1 within two weeks of release and was certified gold within six months, spending almost a year on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts. Its appeal cut across genres in what was becoming a fragmented music scene.

==Reissue==
The album was reissued in 1980 without the song &quot;Sister Fatima&quot;, and again on June 27, 2003 with the track restored, along with the addition of two bonus tracks. Also the first Spanish issue delivered by Hispavox was released without &quot;Sister Fatima&quot;.

<text>Norseman is a town located in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia along the Coolgardie-Esperance Highway, east of Perth and above sea level. It is also the starting point of the Eyre Highway, and the last major town in Western Australia before the South Australian border to the east. At the 2021 census, Norseman had a population of 562, of which 17% were Australian Aboriginal.

==History==
The quest for gold led to the establishment of Norseman, on the traditional land of the Ngadju. Today there are a number of small goldmining operations in the area but only the Central Norseman Gold Corporation can be considered a major producer. Gold was first found in the Norseman area in 1892, about 10 km south of the town, near Dundas. The &quot;Dundas Field&quot; was proclaimed in August 1893 and a townsite gazetted there.

In August 1894, Lawrence Sinclair, his brother George Sinclair, and Jack Alsopp discovered a rich gold reef. Sinclair named it after his horse, Hardy Norseman. The family had originally come from the Shetland Isles in December 1863. Laurie&#x27;s brother James was working in Esperance as the Post and Telegraphist Master. 

In January 1895 the mining warden asked the Government to declare a townsite for the 200 or so miners who had arrived. It was gazetted on 22 May. The Aboriginal name for the area isad &quot;Jimberlana&quot;. A mining entrepreneur from Melbourne, Ernest McCaughan, led a party of 13 by steamship from Melbourne to Esperance to walk inland and discover the central part of the Gold Field. He later went on to develop substantial mining interests in Western Australia and Tasmania.

Norseman initially struggled to develop because of the established town of Dundas; but, between 1895 and 1901, a post office, banks, doctor, courthouse, stores and churches were established and, in 1899 Cobb &amp; Co, mail coaches started delivering mail to Norseman. In 1935, Western Mining Corporation came to Norseman and invested significantly in its infrastructure, resulting in new bitumen roads, electricity and an extension of the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme to the town.

The population of the town was 418 (262 males and 156 females) in 1898.

Once it was the second-richest goldfield in Western Australia, next to the Golden Mile of Kalgoorlie. It is claimed that since 1892, over 100 tonnes of gold have been extracted from the area. The Norseman Gold Mine is Australia&#x27;s longest continuously running gold mining operation. As of 2006, it had been in operation for more than 65 years, producing in excess of 5.5 million ounces of gold in that time.

==Present day==
Modern Norseman is a small, sprawling town driven by mining, tourism and dominated by a huge tailings dump.

Norseman is located 724 km east of Perth via Great Eastern Highway and Coolgardie-Esperance Highway, and has a population of about 1,000. It contains a district high school (opened 1894), shopping facilities, accommodation (hotel, motel, caravan park), district hospital, council offices and a Community resource centre are located within the town. Being at the start of the Eyre Highway, two fuel outlets are available.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Norseman experiences a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSh&quot;).

<text>Circassian ( ), also known as Cherkess ( ), is a subdivision of the Northwest Caucasian language family, spoken by the Circassian people. There are two main variants of the Circassian language, defined by their literary standards, Adyghe (; also known as West Circassian) and Kabardian (; also known as East Circassian). The languages are highly mutually intelligible with one another, but differ to a degree where they would be considered clear-cut dialects. The earliest extant written records of the Circassian language are in the Arabic script, recorded by the Turkish traveller Evliya Çelebi in the 17th century, although the Greek and Georgian alphabets were adapted for them in ancient and medieval times.

There is consensus among the linguistic community about the fact that Adyghe and Kabardian are typologically distinct languages. However, the local terms for these languages refer to them as dialects. The Circassian people call themselves (; English: Adyghe) in their native language. In the southwestern part of European Russia, there is also a Federal Subject called Adygea (, ), enclaved within Krasnodar Krai, which is named after the Circassian endonym. In the Russian language, the Circassian subdivision is treated as a group of languages and called (, meaning the Adyghe languages), whereas the Adyghe language is called (, meaning the language of those in [the Republic of] Adygea). The terms &quot;Circassian&quot; and &quot;Cherkess&quot; are sometimes used in several languages as synonyms for the Northwest Caucasian languages in general or the Adyghe language in particular.

<text>The Air Medal (AM) is a military decoration of the United States Armed Forces. It was created in 1942 and is awarded for single acts of heroism or meritorious achievement while participating in aerial flight.

==Criteria==
The Air Medal was established by , signed by Franklin D. Roosevelt on May 11, 1942. It was awarded retroactive to September 8, 1939, to anyone who distinguishes himself by meritorious achievement while serving with the Armed Forces in aerial flight.

The original award criteria set by an Army Policy Letter dated September 25, 1942, were for one award of the Air Medal:

* per each naval vessel or three enemy aircraft in flight confirmed destroyed. An entire aircrew would be credited for the destruction of a ship, but only the pilot or gunner responsible would be credited for destroying an enemy aircraft.
* per 25 operational flights during which exposure to enemy fire is expected.
* per 100 operational flights during which exposure to enemy fire is not expected.

These criteria were altered by the commanding generals of each numbered Air Force to fit the conditions of their theater of operations and to maintain morale. The Distinguished Flying Cross would usually be awarded for roughly twice to five times the requirements of the Air Medal. This led to automatic &quot;score card&quot; awards of the Air Medal and Distinguished Flying Cross for completing a set number of operational missions rather than distinguished service, meritorious action, or bravery, as had been intended. On August 5, 1943, such score card awards were officially abolished by a Headquarters Army Air Forces Awards Board memorandum due to the embarrassment when airmen received the Air Medal for &quot;score carding&quot; five missions or more but were later removed from flying duties for &quot;lack of moral fibre&quot;. Commanders could still issue the awards on those grounds, but the recipient must perform exceptional or meritorious service as well.

===Army Air Forces (1942–1947)===
During World War II, the medal&#x27;s award criteria varied widely depending on the theater of operations, the aircraft flown, and the missions accomplished. In Europe, the airspace was considered completely controlled by the enemy and heavy air defenses were encountered, so the criteria were altered from those of the original medal. Bomber, photographic reconnaissance, or observation crewmembers and air transport pilots received it for five sorties, fighter pilots received it for ten sorties, and individual pilots or air crewmen received one award per enemy aircraft shot down. Elsewhere in the Pacific and the China Burma India Theater, the pilots and crews flew mostly over uncontrolled or contested airspace for long hours and lighter air defenses were encountered, so much higher criteria were used. Anti-submarine patrols from the United States could qualify for the medal if an airman logged 200 hours of flight time.

===Air Force (1947–present)===
The Air Medal may be awarded to recognize either single acts of merit or gallantry in combat or for meritorious service in a combat zone. Award of the Air Medal is primarily intended to recognize those personnel who are on current crew member or non-crew member flying status which requires them to participate in aerial flight on a regular and frequent basis in the performance of their primary duties. However, it may also be awarded to certain other individuals whose combat duties require regular and frequent flying in other than a passenger status, or individuals who perform a particularly noteworthy act while performing the function of a crew member but who are not on flying status. These individuals must make a discernible contribution to the operational land combat mission or to the mission of the aircraft in flight.

Examples of personnel whose combat duties require them to fly include those in the attack elements of units involved in air-land assaults against an armed enemy and those directly involved in airborne command and control of combat operations. Examples would be transport performing supporting &quot;Dustoff&quot; Medevac or resupply operations, or aircraft involved in reconnaissance over hostile airspace. Awards will not be made to individuals who use air transportation solely for the purpose of moving from point to point in a combat zone.

The Army may award the Air Medal for peacetime service, but approval authority is by general-grade officers at the group or brigade level or higher. The Air Force does not award the Air Medal for peacetime sustained operational activities and flights. Non-combat meritorious service is instead awarded the Aerial Achievement Medal, instituted in 1988.
==== Ribbon devices ====
* The Air Force uses the aircraft sortie designation as a tool, but uses Oak Leaf Clusters rather than Strike / Flight Numerals to indicate additional awards. A member&#x27;s individual flight management records will list the sorties that are eligible for the award. These sorties are designated Combat, Combat Support, or Operational (Active Air Defense or Hostile Reconnaissance). Only the first sortie of the day counts. Armed aircraft crews require ten sorties for each award, while all others require twenty sorties.
* The United States Secretary of the Air Force approved the &quot;V&quot; Device for Air Medals awarded for heroism in combat effective October 21, 2004. This applies to all Air Force members (Active Duty, Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard), retirees, and veterans. The &quot;V&quot; device is not authorized for wear on the medal for an earlier date.

==Variants==

===US Air Force===
The United States Air Force does not utilize numeral devices on the Air Medal. Subsequent awards are annotated with the traditional oak leaf clusters (OLCs). Enlisted members are also awarded three points toward promotion per award.

Each ribbon carries a maximum of four OLCs; the ribbon signifies the first award, a bronze OLC equals one additional award, and a silver OLC represents five additional awards. If there were more than four OLC devices awarded (like the 10th, 14th, 15th, 18th, 19th, and 20th awards), extra Air Medal ribbons were issued to wear the extra OLCs (although only one Air Medal was awarded). Multiple Air Medals were usually earned by aircrew with extensive flight time and long meritorious service records, like during World War II or Korea.

The award of the medal is sometimes denoted on a member&#x27;s gravestone with the abbreviation &quot;AM&quot; followed by an ampersand and the number of OLCs. For example, &quot;AM&amp;5 OLC&quot; means Air Medal and five oak leaf clusters.

===US Army===

====Air Medal [Army] (1944–1968)====
The United States Army used the same criteria as the Air Force. Oak leaf clusters were awarded on the Air Medal&#x27;s ribbon for additional awards – Bronze OLCs for every additional award and Silver OLCs for every five additional awards. Extra ribbons were worn to hold extra OLCs if the recipient had earned more than four OLCs.

One award was credited per every 25 hours of combat assault flights (any flight in which the aircraft was directly involved in combat), 50 hours of combat support flights (Visual Reconnaissance or Resupply), or 100 hours of non-combat service flights (Administrative or VIP flights). Flight hours were calculated in six-minute blocks.

In 1968 numerals replaced the oak leaf clusters to simplify their display.

====Air Medal [Army] (1968–2006)====
During the Vietnam War, the US Army awarded the Air Medal to Warrant Officer or Commissioned pilots and enlisted aircrew for actual flight time (awards were also made to infantry troops who flew on combat assault missions). This became a bureaucratic nightmare to correctly log because of the short flight time of typical helicopter flights. Later, an equivalent &quot;flight hours&quot; conversion was created and an award standard was set by individual commands. This eventually was standardized in theater to one award per every 24 &quot;flight hours&quot; logged. A simplified set time was awarded depending on the type of mission, regardless of the actual flight time. Administrative or VIP flights counted for a quarter hour, regular duties (such as Visual Reconnaissance or Resupply) counted for a half hour, and hazardous duties (combat assaults or extractions) counted for one hour. Pilots and aircrew could log over 1,000 &quot;flight hours&quot; a year and earn a 40 or higher numeral on their Air Medal ribbon.

The &quot;score card&quot; system was retained after the war. This was changed on December 11, 2006, to an award for every six months of meritorious service instead of the number of flight hours.

====Air Medal [Army] (2006–present)====
Currently (as per AR 600-8-22 [December 11, 2006]) the medal can be awarded for every six months of meritorious service. The recipient must perform flight-related duties while serving in a combat zone. The number of flight hours logged is no longer a criterion. The soldier must be assigned as air crew with flight status (i.e., as a pilot, navigator, or gunner). Soldiers without flight status can be eligible if they help with an aerial attack during general transport (e.g., as a door gunner), serve as a combat controller (e.g., as a Pathfinder or Forward Air Controller) or the combat commander of an air or land operation at the Group or Brigade level or lower. Soldiers being transported by air as passengers are not eligible for the meritorious service award, but they may be eligible for the gallantry award.

==== Ribbon devices ====
* Subsequent awards of the Air Medal are denoted in the U.S. Army by Numeral devices displayed on the medal and ribbon. The Army originally used oak leaf clusters to signify additional awards. However, this was changed to numeral devices in September 1968, during the Vietnam War, when the number of Air Medals awarded became too large to be annotated on a single ribbon.
* Since February 29, 1964, the medal may be awarded with a &quot;V&quot; Device for an act of heroism against an armed enemy less than the criteria for the Distinguished Flying Cross.

===US Navy/US Marine Corps===
The United States Navy and United States Marine Corps have two types of Air Medal awards: &quot;Individual&quot; for singular meritorious acts and &quot;Strike/Flight&quot; for participation in sustained aerial flight operations.

==== Ribbon devices ====

* As of September 27, 2006, gold Numeral devices are used to denote the number of &quot;Individual&quot; Air Medals. (This is a return to the standard used before November 22, 1989.)
* Bronze Strike/Flight numerals denote the total number of Strike/Flight awards. Sorties are missions or sustained operations involving aircraft, like: delivering ordnance against the enemy, landing or evacuating personnel in an assault, or in which personnel are engaged in search and rescue operations. Strikes are combat sorties that encounter enemy opposition. Flights are combat sorties that do not encounter enemy opposition.

Officers of Captain (USN) or Colonel (USMC) rank and above are not eligible for award of the Air Medal on a Strike/Flight basis unless the sorties they fly are required in the performance of their regular duties.

* Since April 5, 1974, the Combat &quot;V&quot; may be authorized for awards for heroism or meritorious action in conflict with an armed enemy.

====Ribbon devices (1989–2006)====
In the interval between November 22, 1989, and September 27, 2006, inch bronze stars, inch gold stars, and inch silver stars denoted the number of &quot;Individual&quot; Air Medals. A bronze star was used to denote a first award. Gold stars were used for the second through the fifth awards, seventh through tenth awards, and so on. Silver stars were used in lieu of five gold stars, and denote the sixth and eleventh (and so on) awards. For &quot;Individual&quot; Air Medals, the Combat &quot;V&quot; may be authorized.

Bronze Strike/Flight numerals denoted the number of Strike/Flight awards. They are authorized for operations in hostile or disputed territory and count the total number of Strikes (operations that faced enemy opposition) and Flights (operations that did not encounter enemy opposition) added together.

===US Coast Guard===
The Commandant of the United States Coast Guard may award the Air Medal to any person in the Armed Forces of the United States who distinguishes themselves by heroic or meritorious achievement while participating in aerial flight.

The Coast Guard awards the &quot;Individual&quot; Air Medal but not the Strike/Flight Award.

====Ribbon devices====
* Gold and silver inch stars are authorized for wear to denote additional Air Medal awards. The gold star denotes the second through fifth awards of the Air Medal. 
* Valor Device may be authorized for wear if the award is for performance of a heroic act or acts while directly performing in conflict or combat with an armed enemy.

===Civil Air Patrol===
During World War II, the Air Medal was also awarded to members of the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) who participated in the CAP&#x27;s anti-submarine patrol program. This was not made public at the time, since the Federal government did not want to admit it was arming civilian aircraft.

==Design==
The medal&#x27;s design is prescribed by law.

Description: A Bronze compass rose 1 inches circumscribing diameter and charged with an eagle volant carrying two lightning flashes in its talons. A fleur-de-lis at the top point holds the suspension ring. The points of the compass rose on the reverse are modeled with the central portion plain for engraving the name of the recipient.

Ribbon: The ribbon is 1 inches wide and consists of the following stripes:

#  inch Ultramarine Blue 67118;
# ¼ inch Golden Orange 67109;
# center  inch Ultramarine Blue;
# ¼ inch Golden Orange; and
#  inch Ultramarine Blue.

Components: The following are authorized components of the Air Medal and the applicable specifications for each:

*a. Decoration (regular size): MIL-D-3943/23. NSN for decoration set is 8455-00-269-5747. For replacement medal NSN 8455-00-246-3837.

<doc id="750266" wikidata="Q5500325" url="?curid=750266" title="Free to Be... You and Me">
<text>Free to Be... You and Me is a children&#x27;s entertainment project, conceived, created and executive-produced by actress and author Marlo Thomas. Produced in collaboration with the Ms. Foundation for Women, it was a record album and illustrated book first released in November 1972 featuring songs and stories sung or told by celebrities of the day (credited as &quot;Marlo Thomas and Friends&quot;) including Alan Alda, Rosey Grier, Cicely Tyson, Carol Channing, Michael Jackson, Roberta Flack, Shirley Jones, Jack Cassidy, and Diana Ross. An ABC television special, also created by Thomas, using poetry, songs, and sketches, followed sixteen months later in March 1974. The basic concept was to encourage post-1960s gender neutrality, saluting values such as individuality, tolerance, and comfort with one&#x27;s identity. A major thematic message is that anyone—whether a boy or a girl—can achieve anything.

In 2021, the album was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry.

== Overview ==
The original idea to create the album began with Marlo Thomas, who wanted to teach her then-young niece Dionne about life, in particular that it is acceptable to refute or reject the gender stereotypes expressed in children&#x27;s books of the period. In an Emmy Legends interview Thomas explains:

I told my sister Terre &quot;it would take Dionne 30 years to get over it [stories featuring traditional gender roles], the same as it took all of us. We need to find her some different books to read,&quot; and she said, &quot;You go and find &#x27;em.&quot;

Well there weren&#x27;t any. And not only weren&#x27;t there any, I was in the bookstore one day looking around and found this one (picture book—&quot;I&#x27;m Glad I&#x27;m a Boy! I&#x27;m Glad I&#x27;m a Girl!&quot; by Whitney Darrow Jr.) that showed a pilot on one page and a stewardess on a facing page (with a caption) that said &quot;Boys are pilots, girls are stewardesses.&quot; Well I nearly had a heart attack right there in the bookstore. So I said &quot;I&#x27;ll make a record for Dionne. I&#x27;ll ask everybody to donate their talents and it&#x27;ll be fun.&quot;

Produced by Carole Hart, with music produced by Stephen J. Lawrence and Bruce Hart, with stories and poems directed by Alan Alda, the title has never been out of print.

Proceeds went to the Ms. Foundation for Women. The album was originally released on Bell Records in 1972 and, since 1975, has been available on Arista Records cassettes and CDs.

Well-known songs include &quot;It&#x27;s All Right to Cry,&quot; sung by football hero Rosey Grier; the title track by the New Seekers; &quot;Helping,&quot; a Shel Silverstein poem performed by Tom Smothers; &quot;Sisters and Brothers&quot; by the Voices of East Harlem; and &quot;When We Grow Up&quot; performed by Diana Ross on the album and by Roberta Flack and a teenage Michael Jackson on the special.

Other sketches, some of them animated in the television special, include &quot;Atalanta,&quot; co-narrated by Thomas and Alda, a retelling of the ancient Greek legend of Atalanta; &quot;Boy Meets Girl&quot; with Thomas and Mel Brooks providing the voices for puppets, designed, performed and manipulated by Wayland Flowers, resembling human babies, who use cultural gender stereotypes to try to discover which is a boy and which a girl; &quot;William&#x27;s Doll&quot;, based on Charlotte Zolotow&#x27;s picture book about a boy whose family resists his requests for a doll until his grandmother explains that William wishes to practice being a good father; and &quot;Dudley Pippin&quot; with Robert Morse and Billy De Wolfe, based on stories by Phil Ressner.

A number of pieces from the record did not make the special, most for lack of time, although &quot;Housework&quot; was left off due to the somewhat condescending tone it lent to its description of domestic workers.

Thomas says in the Emmy Legends 40th anniversary interview:

 In among all the praise we got for the project as a whole, we kept getting all these letters and phone calls talking about the track sounding as if it wasn&#x27;t normal to be fond of cooking and cleaning and caretaking etc. So we left that off the special for that reason.

The children pictured on the original LP jacket were schoolmates of Abigail, Robin, and David Pogrebin, children of Letty Cottin Pogrebin, then editor of &quot;Ms.&quot; Most of the children attended Corlears School.

&quot;Marlo Thomas and Friends&quot; followed &quot;Free to Be... You and Me&quot; with a 1988 sequel, &quot;Free to Be... a Family&quot;, the first primetime variety show created and produced in both the United States and the Soviet Union.

== Reception ==

Reviewing the LP in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;I&#x27;ve been giving this high-minded feminist kiddie record to various young Americans on the theory that it is not necessary, or easy, to like the New York Dolls at age five. I figured it would be good for them, like baths. Surprise number one is that they all love it, to a person. Surprise number two is that I myself would much rather listen to Carol Channing on housework than to Robert Klein on dope.&quot;

According to Thomas, &quot;Larry Uttal at Bell Records told me, this kind of record might sell 15,000 copies tops. Well it went Gold right away, went Platinum within two years and went Diamond in under ten years. EVERYBODY was amazed it had touched such a nerve. It&#x27;s still in the top 100 albums of all time over 40 years later.&quot;

&quot;Free to Be&quot; faced backlash from some conservative religious leaders, including Evangelical author and psychologist James Dobson.

In her 2010 memoir, &quot;Growing Up Laughing&quot;, Thomas reflected on the astonishing impact the Free to Be projects had on the culture.

The show won an Emmy and a Peabody, the book became number one on the &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller list and the record went gold. We were floored by the impact it all had. My little message for Dionne had gone straight to the hearts of moms and dads and aunties and uncles and, most of all, teachers, who embraced it as a way to teach the kids in their lives a new way of thinking about themselves.

==Television special==
A television special, produced by Marlo Thomas and Free to Be Productions, in association with Teru Murakami-Fred Wolf Films, Inc. and cosponsored by the Ms. Foundation, first aired March 11, 1974, on ABC. The broadcast earned an 18.6 rating/27 share and went on to win an Emmy Award. 16mm prints were also struck, and some schoolchildren from the 1970s and 1980s remember seeing the television special, or the filmstrip based on the special, at school during the era.

The special appeared occasionally on HBO throughout the 1980s, and was released on VHS and Betamax videotapes through Vestron Video subsidiary Children&#x27;s Video Library in 1983. It also aired on cable channel TV Land.

A Region 1 DVD was released in November 2001, and in 2010, a newly remastered version was issued featuring a number of new extras, including a deleted scene showcasing Dustin Hoffman.

<doc id="750272" wikidata="Q2915384" url="?curid=750272" title="The Giving Tree">
<text>The Giving Tree is an American children&#x27;s picture book written and illustrated by Shel Silverstein. First published in 1964 by Harper &amp; Row, it has become one of Silverstein&#x27;s best-known titles, and has been translated into numerous languages.

==Background==
Silverstein had difficulty finding a publisher for &quot;The Giving Tree&quot;. An editor at Simon &amp; Schuster rejected the book&#x27;s manuscript because he felt that it was &quot;too sad&quot; for children and &quot;too simple&quot; for adults. Tomi Ungerer encouraged Silverstein to approach Ursula Nordstrom, who was a publisher with Harper &amp; Row.

An editor with Harper &amp; Row stated that Silverstein had made the original illustrations &quot;scratchy&quot; like his cartoons for &quot;Playboy&quot;, but that he later reworked the art in a &quot;more pared-down and much sweeter style&quot;. The final black-and-white drawings have been described as &quot;unadorned...visual minimalism&quot;. Harper &amp; Row published a small first edition of the book, consisting of only 5,000–7,500 copies, in 1964.

==Plot==
The book follows the lives of an apple tree and a boy, who develop a relationship with each other. The tree is very &quot;giving&quot; and the boy ages into a &quot;taking&quot; teenager, a young man, a middle-aged man, and finally an elderly man. Despite the fact that the boy ages in the story, the tree addresses him as &quot;Boy&quot; throughout his entire life.

In his childhood, the boy enjoys playing with the tree, climbing her trunk, swinging from her branches, carving &quot;Me + T (Tree)&quot; into the bark, and eating her apples. However, as the boy grows older, he spends less time with the tree and tends to visit her only when he wants material items at various stages of his life, or not coming to the tree alone [such as bringing his girlfriend to the tree and carving &quot;Me +Y.L.&quot; (her initials, often assumed to be an initialism for &quot;young love&quot;)] into the tree. In an effort to make the boy happy at each of these stages, the tree gives him parts of herself, which he can transform into material items, such as money from her apples when the boy is a teenager, a house from her branches when the boy is a young man, and a boat from her trunk when the boy is a middle-aged man. With every stage of giving, &quot;the Tree was happy&quot;.

In the final pages, both the tree and the boy feel the consequences of their respective &quot;giving&quot; and &quot;taking&quot; nature. When only a stump remains for the tree, the boy returns as a tired elderly man to meet the tree once more. She mentions she cannot provide him shade, apples, or any materials like in the past. The man tells her that all he wants is &quot;a quiet place to sit and rest&quot;, which the tree, who is weak being just a stump, could provide. With this final stage of giving, &quot;the Tree was happy&quot;.

==Reception==
Interest in the book increased by word of mouth; for example, in churches &quot;it was hailed as a parable on the joys of giving&quot;. As of 2001, over 5 million copies of the book had been sold, placing it 14th on a list of hardcover &quot;All-Time Bestselling Children&#x27;s Books&quot; from &quot;Publishers Weekly.&quot; By 2011, 8.5 million copies of the book had been sold.

In a 1999–2000, National Education Association online survey of children, the book was ranked 24th among the &quot;Kids&#x27; Top 100 Books&quot;. In the 2007 online &quot;Teachers&#x27; Top 100 Books for Children&quot; poll by the National Education Association, the book came in third. It was 85th of the &quot;Top 100 Picture Books&quot; of all time in a 2012 poll by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;. &quot;Scholastic Parent &amp; Child&quot; magazine placed it #9 on its list of &quot;100 Greatest Books for Kids&quot; in 2012. As of 2013, it ranked third on a Goodreads list of &quot;Best Children&#x27;s Books&quot;.

== Interpretations ==
The book prompted a diverse scope of interpretations from several critics. These can be summarized:

=== Religious interpretations ===
Ursula Nordstrom attributed the book&#x27;s success partially to &quot;Protestant ministers and Sunday-school teachers&quot;, who believed that the tree represents &quot;the Christian ideal of unconditional love&quot;.

===Environmental interpretations===
Some have interpreted the tree as Mother Nature and the boy represents humanity. The book has been used to teach children environmental ethics. An educational resource for children describes the book as an &quot;allegory about the responsibilities a human being has for living organisms in the environment&quot;. Lisa Rowe Fraustino states that &quot;some curricula use the book as a what-not-to-do role model&quot;.

===Friendship interpretations===
One writer believes that the relationship between the boy and the tree is one of friendship. As such, the book teaches children &quot;as your life becomes polluted with the trappings of the modern world — as you &#x27;grow up&#x27; — your relationships tend to suffer if you let them fall to the wayside&quot;. Another writer&#x27;s criticism of this interpretation is that the tree appears to be an adult when the boy is young, and cross-generational friendships are rare. Additionally, this relationship can be seen from a humanities perspective, emphasizing the need for helping each other.

===Mother–child interpretations===
A common interpretation of the book is that the tree and the boy have a mother–son relationship, as in a 1995 collection of essays about the book edited by Richard John Neuhaus in the journal &quot;First Things&quot;. Among the essayists, some were positive about the relationship; for example, Amy A. Kass wrote about the story that &quot;it is wise and it is true about giving and about motherhood&quot;, and her husband Leon R. Kass encourages people to read the book because the tree &quot;is an emblem of the sacred memory of our own mother&#x27;s love&quot;. Other essayists put forth negative views. Mary Ann Glendon wrote that the book is &quot;a nursery tale for the &#x27;me&#x27; generation, a primer of narcissism, a catechism of exploitation&quot;, and Jean Bethke Elshtain felt that the story ends with the tree and the boy &quot;both wrecks&quot;.

A 1998 study using phenomenographic methods found that Swedish children and mothers tended to interpret the book as dealing with friendship, while Japanese mothers tended to interpret the book as dealing with parent–child relationships.

===Political interpretations===
Christopher Westley, writing for the Mises Institute (an anarcho-capitalist think-tank), describes the tree-boy relationship as similar to a socialist or communist government that extracts far too much from its citizens while not providing anything back in return. He describes this unsustainable and parasitic relationship as something toxic and ought to be avoided at all costs, regardless of whether on an individual level, such as two lovers, or a parent and child, or on the level of voter to their government.

===Interpretation as satire===
Some authors believe that the book is not actually intended for children, but instead should be treated as a satire aimed at adults along the lines of &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; by Jonathan Swift.

== Criticism and controversy ==
Elizabeth Bird, writing for the &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, described &quot;The Giving Tree&quot; as &quot;one of the most divisive books in children&#x27;s literature&quot;. Criticism revolves about the depiction of the relationship between the boy and the tree.
Winter Prosapio said that the boy never thanks the tree for its gifts. In an interview with &quot;Horn Book Magazine&quot;, Phyllis J. Fogelman, an editor with Harper &amp; Row, said the book is &quot;about a sadomasochistic relationship&quot; and &quot;elevates masochism to the level of a good&quot;, which mirrors Mary Daly&#x27;s analysis in &quot;Gyn/Ecology: the Metaethics of Radical Feminism&quot;.

One college instructor discovered that the book caused both male and female remedial reading students to be angry because they felt that the boy exploited the tree. For teaching purposes, he paired the book with a short story by Andre Dubus entitled &quot;The Fat Girl&quot; because its plot can be described as &quot;The Giving Tree&quot; &quot;in reverse&quot;.

Ruth Margalit further relayed the damaging message that mothers sometimes have by receiving &quot;The Giving Tree&quot; as a gift; she quotes children&#x27;s book author Laurel Snyder who said, &quot;When you give a new mother ten copies of &#x27;The Giving Tree,&#x27; it does send a message to the mother that we are supposed to be this person.&quot;

=== Author&#x27;s photograph ===
The photograph of Silverstein on the back cover of the book has attracted negative attention, with some people finding it frightening.

==Cultural influences and adaptations==
===Other versions===
A short animated film of the book, produced in 1973, featured Silverstein&#x27;s narration.

Silverstein also wrote a song of the same name, which was performed by Bobby Bare and his family on his album &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Kitchen&quot; (1974).

Silverstein created an adult version of the story in a cartoon entitled &quot;I Accept the Challenge&quot;. In the cartoon, a nude woman cuts off a nude man&#x27;s arms and legs with scissors, then sits on his torso in a pose similar to the final drawing in &quot;The Giving Tree&quot; in which the old man sits on the stump.

University of Illinois Springfield professor Jacqueline Jackson and Carol Dell (1979) wrote an &quot;alternative version&quot; of the story for teaching purposes that was entitled &quot;The Other Giving Tree&quot;. It featured two trees next to each other and a boy growing up. One tree acted like the one in &quot;The Giving Tree&quot;, ending up as a stump, while the other tree stopped at giving the boy apples, and does not give the boy its branches or trunk. At the end of the story, the stump was sad that the old man chose to sit under the shade of the other tree.

In 2010, two parodies were published by different authors, &quot;The Taking Tree&quot; and &quot;The Taking Tree: A Selfish Parody&quot;, that use comedy to change the story and its message. And later, writer Topher Payne came up with an alternate ending by modifying the second half of the book, calling it &quot;The Tree Who Set Healthy Boundaries&quot;.

===Cultural influences===
The Giving Tree Band took its name from the book. Plain White T&#x27;s EP &quot;Should&#x27;ve Gone to Bed&quot; has a song &quot;The Giving Tree&quot;, written by Tim Lopez. The 2010 short film &quot;I&#x27;m Here&quot;, written and directed by Spike Jonze, is based on &quot;The Giving Tree&quot;; the main character Sheldon is named after Shel Silverstein.

<doc id="750273" wikidata="Q458920" url="?curid=750273" title="John Wrathall">
<text>John James Wrathall (28 August 191331 August 1978), was a British-born Rhodesian politician. He was the last white President of Rhodesia (later holders of the post were only acting as such). He formerly worked as a chartered accountant.

==Early life==
Wrathall was born in Lancaster in Lancashire, Great Britain, and went to Lancaster Royal Grammar School. Having qualified as a chartered accountant in 1935, he emigrated to Southern Rhodesia the next year. He worked for the Southern Rhodesian Government in its income tax department for the next ten years.

==Rhodesian career==
In 1946 Wrathall set up in private practice as an accountant in Bulawayo and also became involved in politics. In 1949 he was elected to Bulawayo City Council, where he served for a decade. Wrathall was elected to the Legislative Assembly for Bulawayo South in the 1954 general election, as a member of the United Federal Party, then led by Garfield Todd, but stood down after one term in 1958.

==Ministerial office==
By 1962 Wrathall was no longer a supporter of the United Federal Party and became a founder member of the Rhodesian Front under Winston Field. He was elected in Bulawayo North in the December 1962 election under the RF banner, defeating the incumbent, Cyril Hatty, by 67 votes. As one of the party&#x27;s most experienced members, in October 1963 he was made Minister of African Education. A month later he also took on the Ministry of Health, which was being transferred from the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland on its demise at the end of 1963.

Wrathall was among the members of the Rhodesian Front who deposed Winston Field and instead installed Ian Smith as Prime Minister in April 1964. Smith promoted him to be Minister of Finance and of Posts and Telecommunications. As such, he was one of the signatories to the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) on 11 November 1965. He was Deputy Prime Minister from 7 September 1966. Known as &quot;the quiet man of Rhodesian politics&quot;, he nevertheless was a key figure in the secret struggle against United Nations sanctions imposed after UDI.

As Minister of Finance, Wrathall also oversaw the adoption of a new decimal currency to replace the Rhodesian pound, known as the Rhodesian dollar, a name which he regarded as having international substance.

In July 1973 Wrathall ceded his responsibility as Minister of Posts; during the 1974 general election he stood down from the House of Assembly and transferred to the Senate. In 1975 he presented his 12th (and last) consecutive Budget as Rhodesia&#x27;s longest serving Minister of Finance.

==Presidency==
In 1976, Wrathall became the second President of Rhodesia, succeeding Clifford Dupont. 
On 14 January of that year, he was sworn in as president by the Chief Justice, Sir Hugh Beadle, in a ceremony at Government House witnessed by Prime Minister Ian Smith and his Cabinet ministers. Wrathall served for two and a half years, and died in office of a heart attack.

<doc id="750274" wikidata="Q179293" url="?curid=750274" title="Kingdom of Castile">
<text>The Kingdom of Castile (; : ) was a polity in the Iberian Peninsula during the Middle Ages. It traces its origins to the 9th-century County of Castile (, ), as an eastern frontier lordship of the Kingdom of León. During the 10th century, the Castilian counts increased their autonomy, but it was not until 1065 that it was separated from the Kingdom of León and became a kingdom in its own right. Between 1072 and 1157, it was again united with León, and after 1230, the union became permanent.

Throughout that period, the Castilian kings made extensive conquests in southern Iberia at the expense of the Islamic principalities. The Kingdoms of Castile and of León, with their southern acquisitions, came to be known collectively as the Crown of Castile, a term that also came to encompass overseas expansion.

==History==
===9th to 11th centuries: beginnings===
According to the chronicles of Alfonso III of Asturias, the first reference to the name &quot;Castile&quot; (Castilla) can be found in a document written during AD 800. In the Al-Andalus chronicles from the Cordoban Caliphate, the oldest sources refer to it as Al-Qila, or &quot;the castled&quot; high plains past the territory of Alava, further south than it and the first encountered in their expeditions from Zaragoza. The name reflects its origin as a march on the eastern frontier of the Kingdom of Asturias, protected by castles, towers, or castra, in a territory formerly called Bardulia.

The County of Castile, bordered in the south by the northern reaches of the Spanish Sistema Central mountain system, was just north of modern-day Madrid province. It was re-populated by inhabitants of Cantabria, Asturias, Vasconia and Visigothic and Mozarab origins. It had its own Romance dialect and customary laws.

From the first half of the 9th century until the middle of the century, in which it came to be paid more attention, it was administered and defended by the monarchs of Leon, due to the increased incursions from the Emirate of Córdoba. Its first repopulation settlements were led by small abbots and local counts from the other side of the Cantabrian ridge neighbor valleys, Trasmiera and Primorias and smaller ones, from the contiguous maritime valleys of Mena and Encartaciones in nearby Biscay; some of those settlers had abandoned those exposed areas of the Meseta a few decades earlier, and taken refuge in the much denser and more intractable woods of the Atlantic valleys, so they were not that foreign to them.

A mix of settlers from the Cantabrian and Basque coastal areas, which were recently swelled with refugees, was led under the protection of Abbot Vitulus and his brother, Count Herwig, as registered in the local charters they signed around the first years of the 800s. The areas that they settled did not extend far from the Cantabrian southeastern ridges, and not beyond the southern reaches of the high Ebro river valleys and canyon gores.

The first count of a wider and more united Castile was Rodrigo in 850, under Ordoño I of Asturias and Alfonso III of Asturias. He settled and fortified the ancient Cantabrian hill town of Amaya, west and south of the Ebro river, which offered an easier defense from the Muslim military expeditions and command of the main highway, still functional from the Roman Empire, passing by, south of the Cantabrian ridge all the way to Leon. Subsequently, the region was subdivided, separate counts being named to Alava, Burgos, Cerezo &amp; Lantarón, and a reduced Castile. In 931 the county was reunified by Count Fernán González, who rose in rebellion against the Kingdom of León, successor state to Asturias, and achieved an autonomous status, allowing the county to be inherited by his family instead of being subject to appointment by the Leonese king.

===11th and 12th centuries: expansion and union with the Kingdom of León===

 The minority of Count García Sánchez led Castile to accept Sancho III of Navarre, married to the sister of Count García, as feudal overlord. García was assassinated in 1028 while in León to marry the princess Sancha, sister of Bermudo III of León. Sancho III, acting as feudal overlord, appointed his younger son (García&#x27;s nephew) Ferdinand as Count of Castile, marrying him to his uncle&#x27;s intended bride, Sancha of León. Following Sancho&#x27;s death in 1035, Castile returned to the nominal control of León, but Ferdinand, allying himself with his brother García Sánchez III of Navarre, began a war with his brother-in-law Vermudo. At the Battle of Tamarón Vermudo was killed, leaving no surviving heirs. In right of his wife, Ferdinand then assumed the royal title as king of León and Castile, for the first time associating the royal title with the rule of Castile.

When Ferdinand I died in 1065, the territories were divided among his children. Sancho II became King of Castile, Alfonso VI, King of León and García, King of Galicia, while his daughters were given towns: Urraca was given Zamora, and Elvira was given Toro.

Sancho II allied himself with Alfonso VI of León and together they conquered, then divided, Galicia. Sancho later attacked Alfonso VI and invaded León with the help of El Cid, and drove his brother into exile, thereby reuniting the three kingdoms. Urraca permitted the greater part of the Leonese army to take refuge in the town of Zamora. Sancho laid siege to the town, but the Castilian king was assassinated in 1072 by Bellido Dolfos, a Galician nobleman. The Castilian troops then withdrew.

As a result, Alfonso VI recovered all his original territory of León, and became the king of Castile and Galicia. This was the second union of León and Castile, although the two kingdoms remained distinct entities joined only in a personal union. The oath taken by El Cid before Alfonso VI in Santa Gadea de Burgos regarding the innocence of Alfonso in the matter of the murder of his brother is well known.
During the first years of the 12th century, Sancho, the only son of Alfonso VI, died, leaving only his daughter. Because of this, Alfonso VI took a different approach from other European kingdoms, including France. He gave his daughters, Elvira, Urraca, and Theresa in marriage to Raymond of Toulouse, Raymond of Burgundy, and Henry of Burgundy respectively. In the Council of Burgos in 1080 the traditional Mozarabic rite was replaced by the Roman one.
Upon his death, Alfonso VI was succeeded by his daughter, the widowed Urraca, who then married Alfonso I of Aragon, but they almost immediately fell out. Alfonso tried unsuccessfully to conquer Urraca&#x27;s lands, before he repudiated her in 1114. Urraca also had to contend with attempts by her son from her first marriage, the king of Galicia, to assert his rights. When Urraca died, this son became king of León and Castile as Alfonso VII. During his reign, Alfonso VII managed to annex parts of the weaker kingdoms of Navarre and Aragón which fought to secede after the death of Alfonso I of Aragon.
Alfonso VII refused his right to conquer the Mediterranean coast for the new union of Aragón with the County of Barcelona (Petronila and Ramón Berenguer IV).

=== 12th century: a link between Christianity and Islam ===
The centuries of Moorish rule had established Castile&#x27;s high central plateau as a vast sheep pasturage; the fact that the greater part of Spanish sheep-rearing terminology was derived from Arabic underscores the debt.

The 8th and 9th centuries was preceded by a period of Umayyad conquests, as Arabs took control of previously Hellenized areas such as Egypt and Syria in the 7th century. It was at this point they first encountered Greek ideas, though from the beginning, many Arabs were hostile to classical learning. Because of this hostility, the religious Caliphs could not support scientific translations. Translators had to seek out wealthy business patrons rather than religious ones. Until Abbasid rule in the 8th century, however, there was little work in translation. Most knowledge of Greek during Umayyad rule was gained from scholars of Greek who remained from the Byzantine period, rather than through widespread translation and dissemination of texts. A few scholars argue that translation was more widespread than is thought during this period, but this remains the minority view.

The main period of translation was during Abbasid rule. The 2nd Abbasid Caliph Al-Mansur moved the capital from Damascus to Baghdad. Here he founded a great library, containing Greek Classical texts. Al-Mansur ordered this collection of world literature translated into Arabic. Under al-Mansur, and by his orders, translations were made from Greek, Syriac, and Persian. The Syriac and Persian books themselves were translations from Greek or Sanskrit.
A legacy of the 6th century King of Persia, Anushirvan (Chosroes I) the Just was the introduction of many Greek ideas into his kingdom. Aided by this knowledge and the juxtaposition of beliefs, the Abbasids considered it valuable to look at Islam with Greek eyes, and to look at the Greeks with Islamic eyes. Abbasid philosophers also advanced the idea that Islam had, from the very beginning, stressed the gathering of knowledge as a key part of the religion. These new ideas enabled the amassing and translation of Greek concepts to disseminate like never before.

During the 12th century, Europe enjoyed great advances in intellectual achievements, sparked in part by the kingdom of Castile&#x27;s conquest of the great cultural center of Toledo (1085). There Arabic classics were discovered, and contacts established with the knowledge and works of Muslim scientists. In the first half of the century a translation program, called the &quot;School of Toledo&quot;, translated many philosophical and scientific works from the Classical Greek and the Islamic worlds into Latin. Many European scholars, including Daniel of Morley and Gerard of Cremona, travelled to Toledo to gain further knowledge.

The Way of St. James further enhanced the cultural exchange between the kingdoms of Castile and León and the rest of Europe.

The 12th century saw the establishment of many new religious orders, like the rest of Europe, such as Calatrava, Alcántara and Santiago; and the foundation of many Cistercian abbeys.

===13th century: definitive union with the Kingdom of León===

Alfonso VII restored the royal tradition of dividing his kingdom among his children. Sancho III became King of Castile and Ferdinand II, King of León.

The rivalry between both kingdoms continued until 1230 when Ferdinand III of Castile received the Kingdom of León from his father Alfonso IX, having previously received the Kingdom of Castile from his mother Berenguela of Castile in 1217. In addition, he took advantage of the decline of the Almohad empire to conquer the Guadalquivir Valley whilst his son Alfonso X took the taifa of Murcia.

The Courts from León and Castile merged, an event considered as the foundation of the Crown of Castile, consisting of the kingdoms of Castile, León, taifas and other domains conquered from the Moors, including the taifa of Córdoba, taifa of Murcia, taifa of Jaén and taifa of Seville.

===14th and 15th centuries: the House of Trastámara===
The House of Trastámara was a lineage that ruled Castile from 1369 to 1504, Aragón from 1412 to 1516, Navarre from 1425 to 1479, and Naples from 1442 to 1501.

Its name was taken from the Count (or Duke) of Trastámara. This title was used by Henry II of Castile, of the Mercedes, before coming to the throne in 1369, during the civil war with his legitimate brother, King Peter of Castile. John II of Aragón ruled from 1458 to 1479 and upon his death, his daughter became Queen Eleanor of Navarre and his son became King Ferdinand II of Aragon.

====Union of the Crowns of Castile and Aragon====

The marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, in 1469 at the Palacio de los Vivero in Valladolid began the familial union of the two kingdoms. They became known as the Catholic Monarchs &quot;(los Reyes Católicos)&quot;. Isabella succeeded her brother as Queen of Castile and Ferdinand became &quot;jure uxoris&quot; King of Castile in 1474. When Ferdinand succeeded his father as King of Aragon in 1479, the Crown of Castile and the various territories of the Crown of Aragon were united in a personal union, creating for the first time since the 8th century a single political unit, referred to as &quot;España (Spain)&quot;.
&quot;Los Reyes Católicos&quot; started policies that diminished the power of the bourgeoisie and nobility in Castile, and greatly reduced the powers of the &quot;Cortes&quot; (General Courts) to the point where they became rubber-stamps for the monarch&#x27;s acts. They also brought the nobility to their side. In 1492, the Kingdom of Castile conquered the last Moorish state of Granada, thereby ending Muslim rule in Iberia and completing the Reconquista.

===16th century===
On Isabella&#x27;s death in 1504 her daughter, Joanna I, became Queen (in name) with her husband Philip I as King (in authority). After his death Joanna&#x27;s father was regent, due to her perceived mental illness, as her son Charles I was only six years old. On Ferdinand II&#x27;s death in 1516, Charles I was proclaimed as king of Castile and of Aragon (in authority) jointly with his mother Joanna I as the Queen of Castile (in name). As the first monarch to reign over Castile and Aragon, Charles I may be considered as the first operational King of Spain. Charles I also became Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire in 1519.

== Government: municipal councils and parliaments ==
As with all medieval kingdoms, supreme power was understood to reside in the monarch &quot;by the grace of God&quot;, as the legal formula explained. Nevertheless, rural and urban communities began to form assemblies to issue regulations to deal with everyday problems. Over time, these assemblies evolved into municipal councils, known as variously as &quot;ayuntamientos&quot; or &quot;cabildos&quot;, in which some of the inhabitants, the property-owning heads of households (&quot;vecinos&quot;), represented the rest. By the 14th century these councils had gained more powers, such as the right to elect municipal magistrates and officers (&quot;alcaldes&quot;, speakers, clerks, etc.) and representatives to the parliaments (&quot;Cortes&quot;).

Due to the increasing power of the municipal councils and the need for communication between these and the King, &quot;cortes&quot; were established in the Kingdom of León in 1188, and in Castile in 1250. Unlike other kingdoms, Castile didn&#x27;t have a permanent capital (neither did Spain until the 16th century), so the &quot;cortes&quot; were celebrated in whichever city the king chose to stay. In the earliest Leonese and Castilian Cortes, the inhabitants of the cities (known as &quot;laboratores&quot;) formed a small group of the representatives and had no legislative powers, but they were a link between the king and the general population, something that was pioneered by the kingdoms of Castile and León. Eventually the representatives of the cities gained the right to vote in the Cortes, often allying with the monarchs against the great noble lords.

==Arms of the Kingdom of Castile==

During the reign of Alfonso VIII, the king began to use the canting arms of Castile as its emblem, in its blazons and banners, which were gules, a three towered castle or masoned sable and ajouré azure.

<doc id="750282" wikidata="Q6245074" url="?curid=750282" title="John Lloyd Wright">
<text>John Lloyd Wright (December 12, 1892 – December 20, 1972) was an American architect and toy inventor. Born in Oak Park, Illinois, Wright was the second-oldest son of famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright. John Lloyd Wright became estranged from his father in 1909 and subsequently left his home to join his brother on the West Coast. After unsuccessfully working a series of jobs, he decided to take up the profession of his father in 1912. Shortly afterward, he was able to reconnect with his father, who took John under his wing. Differences in opinion regarding the Imperial Hotel, Tokyo caused the pair to again become disunited.

John Lloyd Wright took a break from architecture after this falling-out and focused on designing toys. The most successful of these inventions was Lincoln Logs in 1916, which would later be one of the original inductees into the National Toy Hall of Fame. In 1923, Wright moved to Long Beach, Indiana and designed several buildings. His style was characterized by the Prairie School of architecture with International Style influences. After marrying a third time in 1946, Wright left Indiana for Del Mar, California, where he spent the rest of his life designing houses.

==Biography==
===Early life===
John Lloyd Wright was born on December 12, 1892, while his father, Frank Lloyd Wright, was practicing in Chicago with Adler &amp; Sullivan. He was the second-oldest of the six children of Frank Lloyd and Catherine Wright. They lived in Oak Park, Illinois, in what is now known as the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio. John became estranged from his father in 1909, when Frank abandoned his family to be with Mamah Borthwick Cheney. John was accepted to the University of Wisconsin-Madison shortly after, but soon dropped out. He moved to Portland, Oregon, to get away from his family. He traveled with his elder brother, Lloyd Wright, to San Diego, California, where they worked with the Olmsted Brothers as they prepared for the Panama–Pacific International Exposition. He also sold posters designed by his brother and briefly worked a job pressing pants. Destitute and without direction, he decided to take up the profession of his father and become an architect.

===Early architecture===
While walking in San Diego, he saw a sign calling for a draftsman for the Pacific Building Company. Wright was hired and drew architectural details for bungalows. He soon realized that he had a talent for the profession and sought out a professional architectural firm. He found a position in the firm of Harrison Albright, one of the preeminent architects in Los Angeles. Originally acting as a clerk, Wright received his first design commission for a house in Escondido in 1912. The design was heavily borrowed from his father&#x27;s Sherman M. Booth House in Glencoe, Illinois. Pleased with the results, Albright gave Wright the opportunity to design the Workingman&#x27;s Hotel, a three-story building. During the project, Wright worked closely with sculptor Alfonso Iannelli, whom he would befriend. After the hotel was completed, Wright determined that he should receive formal architectural training. He intended to apprentice with Vienna Secession architect Otto Wagner in exchange for room and board in Vienna, Austria.

After John wrote a letter to his father, asking him for money for a ticket to Vienna, Frank wrote back that John was welcome to train with him. He accepted the opportunity, but struggled under the dominating personality of his father. In 1913, upon completion of Taliesin I, Frank left Chicago for Wisconsin and placed John in charge of his Chicago office. John oversaw the construction of Midway Gardens, utilizing sculpture from his friend Iannelli. John accompanied his father to Japan to oversee the design of the Imperial Hotel. However, an argument over John&#x27;s salary resulted in his firing and the two again became estranged.

In 1913, John married Jeanette Winters, whom he had met in Los Angeles. He designed a home for them in Chicago they called the Bird Center. Now without an architectural practice, John focused on some of his hobbies, including toys. It was at this time that he perfected the design for his Lincoln Logs, an idea he had conceived while in Japan. Construction of the Imperial Hotel required beams to be designed in an interlocking method to make it safe for earthquakes, and John realized that this design could be adapted into a toy version. He used his own funds to bring the idea to market in 1918 as the Red Square Toy Company (so named after his father&#x27;s famous symbol). The toys were notched miniature logs about in diameter that could be arranged to build miniature log cabins. Wright received a patent on August 31, 1920, and had the name registered on August 28, 1923. Wright later sold the patent which became one of the most popular toys ever designed.

===Long Beach and Del Mar===
In 1920, John and Jeanette divorced; Wright moved back to the Oak Park studio with his mother. He remarried in 1921 to Hazel Lundin, and they had a child, Elizabeth, in 1922.

John sought out his father&#x27;s former employer, Louis Sullivan, and had a series of conversations which inspired him to practice architecture again. The next year, he and his family moved to Long Beach, Indiana, so that he could establish his own, independent practice. Wright also opened a second office in the Warren Building in nearby Michigan City. His second child, John Lloyd Wright, Jr., was born in 1925. During this time John&#x27;s designs began to shift from his father&#x27;s Prairie School style to the emerging International Style. This transition was particularly notable following a 1929 trip to Europe. Among the houses he designed were the Hoover-Timme House (1929), John and Isabel Burnham House (1934), Lowell E. and Paula G. Jackson House (1938), and George and Adele Jaworowski House (1945-1946), all listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.

Aside from houses, Wright was also commissioned to build the local elementary school and town hall. Because Long Beach was populated with wealthy vacationers, Wright was able to receive a steady stream of commissions during the Great Depression. Wright received two Works Progress Administration commissions during the depression, including the Arcade Cabins Hotel in Indiana Dunes State Park. In 1939, a fire devastated Wright&#x27;s house when his automobile caught fire in his garage. The fire destroyed most of his records and designs. Like his father, Wright fell in love with one of his clients, Frances Welsh, and left his family.

During World War II, residential commissions stopped. Wright did manage to receive a commission to design two buildings for the Kingsbury Ordnance Plant 20 miles south of Long Beach. In 1946, Wright published a biography of his father, &quot;My Father Who Is on Earth&quot;. Wright and Hazel Lundin were divorced in 1942, and Wright married Frances Welsh in 1946. Wright designed a home for him and his third wife in Del Mar, California, later that year. He also resumed his architectural toy designs, designing Wright Blocks and Timber Toys. He designed nearly four dozen houses in California until his death on December 20, 1972, eight days after his eightieth birthday.

<text>Joseph Marshall Walker (July 1, 1784 – January 20, 1856) was a Louisiana soldier and politician and the 13th Governor of Louisiana, from 1850 to 1853. He is best known for being the first Governor inaugurated in the new state capital building in Baton Rouge.

== Early life ==
Walker was born in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana in July, 1786 when Louisiana was a colony of Spain. Walker was the son of English immigrant Peter Walker and Charlotte Constance Revoil, a second-generation Louisiana creole woman. He married Catherine Carter of Adams County, Mississippi, in the mid-1810s, and together they had twelve children.

In 1807, Walker went to Mexico and joined the Spanish army, serving as a lieutenant of dragoons, and later becoming master of a military school at Chihuahua.

After the outbreak of the War of 1812 he returned to New Orleans and enlisted in the Louisiana State Militia where he fought against the British in the Battle of New Orleans at Chalmette, Louisiana.

==Political career==
A member of the Democratic Party, Walker was first elected to public office in 1820, as a member of the House of Representatives of Louisiana.

On January 22, 1822, he was promoted to brigadier general of the First Brigade of the State Militia, serving concurrently with his role as a member of the state house.

Walker was reelected to the legislature three times—in 1822, 1832, and 1836. He was active in promoting the State Militia, and was credited with improving the organization and discipline of that force.

In 1846 he served as State Treasurer.

In 1849 he ran for Governor, winning against split Whig opposition from General Alexander De Clouet and Duncan F. Kenner. On 28 January 1850, he became the first governor inaugurated in the new state capital at Baton Rouge.

As governor, he established a free public school system for white children.

There was widespread opposition to the 1846 State Constitution, and in 1852, a convention elected to adopt a new one. Walker strongly objected to this document, and, as a result, he subsequently resigned his position the following year, retiring to a family plantation in Rapides Parish. He turned down offers from Democratic Party officials to be their candidate for the United States House of Representatives. Joseph Marshall Walker died three years later in 1856 and is buried on his plantation.

<text>Second corporal is a military rank, used in some countries.

==National use==

===Portugal===
Second corporal () is an enlisted rank of the army and the air force. Its rank insignia is a single chevron. The rank is immediately below first corporal (). The rank of second corporal was created in the late 19th century to replace the former rank of lance-corporal ().

===United Kingdom===
Second corporal was a former rank in the Royal Engineers and Army Ordnance Corps of the British Army. Second corporals wore one rank chevron like lance-corporals, but unlike the latter, which was an appointment, they held full non-commissioned officer rank. They were thus equivalent to bombardiers in the Royal Artillery. The rank was abolished in 1920.

<text>Louis Booker Wright (March 1, 1899 – December 26, 1984) was an American author, educator and librarian.

Wright was the director of the Folger Shakespeare Library, the author of numerous books about the American colonial period, and in 1928 he was awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship.

==Life and career==
Wright resided in Greenwood County, South Carolina, his birthplace, until he attended Wofford College, where he enlisted in the Student Army Training Corps. He was subsequently stationed at Plattsburgh, New York, for six months during World War I. He did not return directly to Wofford after the war, but spent several months as an airmail pilot before resuming his studies. In 1920 he graduated from Wofford with a B.A. in chemistry. In 1923, he became an English teaching assistant at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he wrote his Master&#x27;s thesis in 1924. In 1926, he received his Ph.D from Chapel Hill and became an Assistant Professor of English there. During this period, he married Francis Black. Louis and Francis moved to London in 1928 upon his reception of a Guggenheim Fellowship.

In 1931, joined the staff of the Huntington Library as an administrator and scholar. Much of his research at Huntington was concerned with the English Renaissance and the colonial period of the United States. While at the Huntington, he also served as a visiting professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, the California Institute of Technology, and Pomona College.

Before his appointment as director of the Folger Shakespeare Library in 1947, Wright was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters by Princeton University. He officially began working for the Folger in the summer of 1948. While director, Wright used administrative insight gained at the Huntington to initiate more modern and efficient practices at the Folger, adding reference works and improving lighting in the main research room. During his time as director, Folger also adopted the Library of Congress&#x27; classification system. With Virginia LaMar, the Folger&#x27;s executive secretary, Wright edited an early series of Folger Shakespeare Library editions of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, drawing on Folio and Quarto editions of the plays and compiling notes to make the plays as accessible as possible to the casual reader. The editions were published in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1948 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1949. Following retirement Wright published some other books, including Barefoot in Arcadia, a coming of age memoir about his developmental years in South Carolina.

Wright gave the A.S.W. Rosenbach Lectures in Bibliography in 1966. He received the Cosmos Club Award in 1973. 

Among the organizations Wright served after his retirement in 1968 were the National Geographic Society, the Modern Language Association, and the Harry S. Truman Institute for National and International Affairs. Wright died in 1984 of cardiovascular disease in Chevy Chase, Maryland. He is buried in West Oakwood Cemetery, Spartanburg, SC with his wife and her parents.

<doc id="750299" wikidata="Q205837" url="?curid=750299" title="Fat-tailed dwarf lemur">
<text>The fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus medius), also known as the lesser dwarf lemur, western fat-tailed dwarf lemur, or spiny forest dwarf lemur, is endemic to Madagascar. 

The fat-tailed dwarf lemur is long from its head to the end of its torso, with an tail extending beyond that. It weighs . It has a lifespan of 4-11 years in the wild and 18 years in captivity. It uses its tail to store fat reserves for torpor.

==Hibernation==
Recent research has shown that &quot;C. medius&quot; hibernates (or aestivates), even though in the tropical winter of Madagascar, temperatures remain high. It is the first tropical mammal and only primate in which hibernation has been demonstrated. However, the Malagasy winter is dry, and it appears that the lemur is avoiding the drought. It can hibernate for seven months. Unlike animals that hibernate in temperate regions, the lemur does not control its body temperature while hibernating, and if the tree hole in which it is sleeping is not well insulated, its body temperature fluctuates in accordance with the outside temperature. During torpor, this lemur has been found to periodically enter REM sleep; non-REM sleep has not been observed, a pattern opposite that found in hibernating ground squirrels. The REM sleep episodes occurred during periods of higher ambient temperature (averaging 27 C, versus an average of 20 C during nonsleeping intervals while in torpor).

&quot;C. medius&quot; has a significantly longer lifespan than other strepsirrhinine or nonstrepsirrhinine primates of similar size, and this longevity is thought to be related to its status as part of the only primate genus that is an obligatory hibernator. Its maximum lifespan in captivity is nearly 30 years.

Like other fat-tailed lemurs, &quot;C. medius&quot; is able to store fat in its tail, and this provides a source of energy during its period of dormancy.

== Reproduction ==
Although most &quot;C. medius&quot; live in areas where the environment is dry, there are those who live in tropical rain forest. Through research, it is understood that these animals hibernation period is linked to their reproduction strategies. In the rainforest these lemurs are in more of an active state than they would be in a dry forest. This level of high activity from the lemurs is linked to higher reproduction rates according to Dr. Lahann.

==Taxonomy==

Between 2000 and 2009, a population of dwarf lemur was known as a separate species, the southern fat-tailed dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus adipicaudatus). It was described by taxonomist Colin Groves as having a pelage coloration that is dark dorsally and gray ventrally, with a vaguely expressed dorsal stripe running down the back, a relatively short white median facial stripe, and black eye-rings. However, in 2009, Groeneveld &quot;et al.&quot; demonstrated genetically that &quot;Cheirogaleus adipicaudatus&quot; was a synonym of &quot;Cheirogaleus medius&quot;, so the southern fat-tailed dwarf lemur is no longer recognized as a species.

==Behaviour ==
This species is nocturnal, with a diet of insects, other small animals, fruits and flowers.

The fat-tailed lemur is the only known primate to hibernate for extended periods of time, up to seven months. It performs this torpor during the dry season to minimise the impacts of droughts. During the wet season, it gorges on food, accumulating a fat reserve in its tail. By the beginning of torpor, the tail accounts for up to 40% of its body weight.

<text>Black Celebration is the fifth studio album by English electronic music band Depeche Mode, released on 17 March 1986 by Mute Records. The album&#x27;s co-producer Daniel Miller devised &quot;a plan to capture the essence of the dark works&quot; that Martin Gore created because Martin Gore had no intention of compromising the mood that his demos had set. Miller and Gareth Jones produced the album to be more like an environment rather than a collection of songs. Their production created &quot;a tech-noir future dystopia&quot; that &quot;glitters of gloom&quot;.

&quot;Black Celebration&quot; reached number four on the UK Albums Chart, and has been cited as one of the most influential albums of the 1980s. To promote the album, the band embarked on the Black Celebration Tour. Three years after its release, &quot;Spin&quot; ranked it at number 15 on its &quot;25 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list.

The album was promoted by the single &quot;Stripped&quot; released 10 February, and was followed by &quot;A Question of Lust&quot;, released 14 April, &quot;A Question of Time&quot; released 11 August. Instead of &quot;Stripped&quot;, &quot;But Not Tonight&quot; was released as a single in the US, due to its more commercial appeal, on 22 October.

==Background==
The band wanted to change their working routine yet again to make sure that things would not lead to boredom or lack of production. Daniel Miller stated: &quot;I was a bit frustrated because I couldn&#x27;t get the guys to think about working in different ways.&quot; He admired the working methods of the German film director Werner Herzog, which meant that the band had &quot;lived the album&quot;, meaning they attended the studio every day and worked endlessly on the songs and production. Miller felt that he wanted &quot;a kind of intensity&quot;, as he had felt that production was slowing down since their debut &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot;, which had snappy recording and production, with the exception of &quot;Construction Time Again&quot;, which he claims was due to there being &quot;so many new things going on&quot;.

With regard to the recording processes and song formation, samples were yet again at the forefront of the sound. Gareth Jones stated that they would always use their own samples and tried to avoid using samples from other sources. For example, the opening title track initially was to have samples of Winston Churchill saying &quot;A brief period of rejoicing&quot; because they enjoyed &quot;that idea of a brief moment of rejoicing.&quot; However, instead of sampling Churchill saying it, they had Miller say the quote instead. He said that, though they admired hip hop, they had no desire to sample in the same fashion. &quot;We didn&#x27;t want to collage other people&#x27;s work and drop it into Martin&#x27;s songs. We used samplers to grab real sounds from the real world to make sure our samples were original.&quot; On the song &quot;Fly on the Windscreen&quot;, Jones recalled: &quot;You can hear a rather young sounding Daniel again saying &#x27;over and done with.&#x27; The breath sample noise at the start is interesting too.&quot; On Alan Wilder&#x27;s Shunt website, in the Q&amp;A section, he stated that these &quot;breath samples&quot; were in fact Miller saying &quot;&#x27;Horse&#x27; repeatedly very fast.&quot;

==Critical reception==

Contemporaneous reviews for &quot;Black Celebration&quot; in the British press were mixed. &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Steve Sutherland lambasted the album and wrote that Depeche Mode came off as &quot;pussycats desperate to appear perverted as an escape from the superficiality of teen stardom&quot; and &quot;Sounds&quot; published a similarly scathing review, while criticizing chief songwriter Martin Gore&#x27;s &quot;adolescent fragments of despair&quot;, 

Sean O&#x27;Hagan of &quot;NME&quot; nonetheless praised &quot;Black Celebration&quot;″s &quot;perfectly constructed jigsaw melodies&quot; and concluded, &quot;When the songs address topics other than the composer&#x27;s state of mind – as on the evocative exploration of loneliness that is &#x27;World Full of Nothing&#x27; – Depeche Mode sound like a lot more than just a high tech, low-life melodrama.&quot; Betty Page of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; felt that the band should be admired for their &quot;refusal to follow anything but their own fashion&quot; and &quot;unswerving ability to come up with great, fresh melodies.&quot;

&quot;Black Celebration&quot; has since been reappraised in retrospective reviews. In 2007, Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; referred to the album as an &quot;instant classic for the band&#x27;s fans&quot; that at the time of its release had seemingly been &quot;utterly ignored by everybody else.&quot; Bandmate Andy Fletcher recognised that it was a &quot;classic Depeche Mode fan favourite&quot; among their albums in &quot;The Singles 86&gt;98&quot; Electronic Press Kit, saying &quot;a collection of songs on there that&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.&quot;

Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails cited &quot;Black Celebration&quot;, and its subsequent tour, as an influence and said it helped inspire him to write the album &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;, saying &quot;DM was one of our favorite bands and the &quot;Black Celebration&quot; record took my love for them to a new level.&quot;

==Tour==
The tour began with a European leg, starting in Oxford, England in late March 1986 and finishing in Rüsselsheim, West Germany in late May. A North American jaunt followed in early June, commencing in Boston and culminating mid-July in Irvine, California. Shortly after the North American leg, the group headed to Japan to play three dates.

In early August, the group began a second run of European shows, starting in Fréjus, France. The group performed four additional dates in France, as well as two shows in Italy, before wrapping up the tour in Copenhagen.

Book of Love joined the tour as the opening act on 29 April in Hanover, West Germany, and continued for the rest of the first European leg and throughout all tour dates of the North American leg (ending on 15 July).

==Re-release==
In 2007, &quot;Black Celebration&quot; was re-released with a bonus DVD. It was released on 20 March 2007 in the United States, on 26 March in the United Kingdom and on 2 April in the rest of Europe, as a part of the third wave of reissues (along with &quot;Construction Time Again&quot;). The first CD was remastered and (except in the United States) released as a CD/SACD hybrid. The bonus DVD includes the album&#x27;s B-sides in addition to the singles and B-sides for &quot;Shake the Disease&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Called a Heart&quot;, two singles released in the interim between &quot;Some Great Reward&quot; and &quot;Black Celebration&quot;. The reissue also includes several live versions of some of the songs from &quot;Black Celebration&quot;. The album is released as originally intended and ends with &quot;New Dress&quot; (not &quot;Black Day&quot; or &quot;But Not Tonight&quot;).

As with the other reissues, the accompanying DVD includes a documentary film. The film&#x27;s title, &quot;The Songs Aren&#x27;t Good Enough, There Aren&#x27;t Any Singles and It&#x27;ll Never Get Played on the Radio&quot;, is a quote from the film in which Martin Gore paraphrases Daniel Miller&#x27;s reaction to the album&#x27;s early demos. The documentary includes much detail about the making of the album, its singles and the ensuing tour. Other highlights include the band meeting the Cure and behind-the-scenes footage of several of the music videos.

The remastered album was released on vinyl on 2 April 2007 in Europe and on 11 September 2007 in the United States.

<text>Luke Edward Wright (August 29, 1846 – November 17, 1922) was a United States political figure. He served as Governor-General of the Philippines from 1904 to 1905 and also as Secretary of War from 1908 to 1909.

==Biography==
Luke Edward Wright was born in Giles County, Tennessee, and moved with his family to Memphis in 1850. He attended the public schools, and enlisted at fifteen in the Confederate States Army with Company G of the 154th Senior Tennessee Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War. In 1863, Wright was cited for bravery under fire in the Battle of Murfreesboro and promoted to second lieutenant. After the Civil War, Wright attended the University of Mississippi from 1867 to 1868, but he did not graduate. He was a member of the Delta Psi fraternity, also known as St. Anthony Hall.

After studying law in his father&#x27;s office, Wright was admitted to the bar and entered into practice in Memphis. For eight years, he served as Tennessee Attorney General, and he was instrumental in establishing a relief committee during an epidemic of yellow fever in 1878. Before the nomination of William Jennings Bryan, Wright was a Democrat. In 1900, Wright was a member of the second Philippine Commission and was appointed vice-governor of the Philippines in 1901. Wright became full Governor-General of the Philippines in 1904 and continued in that office until 1905. From 1906 to 1907, Wright served as the first full United States Ambassador to Japan.

From July 1, 1908 to March 11, 1909, Wright served as United States Secretary of War under President Theodore Roosevelt. He stressed actions to eliminate unfit officers and sought to take advantage of aviation technology. He served less than a year before resigning. He returned to private life and died on November 17, 1922, at his home in Memphis. He was buried at Forest Hill Cemetery in Memphis.

==Legacy==
The &quot;Pool of Pines&quot;, better known as Wright Park in Baguio, Philippines was named after Governor Luke E. Wright, the architect of this long, shallow reflecting pool. A street in Dumaguete in Negros Oriental province is named after him.

<text>Philip Quincy Wright (December 28, 1890 – October 17, 1970) was an American political scientist based at the University of Chicago known for his pioneering work and expertise in international law, international relations, and security studies. He headed the Causes of War project at the University of Chicago, which resulted in the prominent 1942 multi-volume book &quot;A Study of War&quot;.

== Biography ==
Born in Medford, Massachusetts, Wright received his B.A. from Lombard College in 1912. He completed his Ph.D. at the University of Illinois in 1915. He also received an LL.D. He taught at Harvard University and the University of Minnesota before joining the department of social sciences at the University of Chicago in 1923. In 1927, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was one of the co-founders of Chicago&#x27;s Committee On International Relations in 1928, the first graduate program in international relations established in the United States. In addition to his academic work, Wright was an adviser to Justice Robert H. Jackson at the Nuremberg Trials, and often provided advice to the U.S. State Department. During World War II, Wright was a consultant in the U.S. State Department. In 1956 he became Professor of International Law in the Woodrow Wilson Department of Foreign Affairs at the University of Virginia. He retired in 1961 and became a visiting professor at numerous universities, both within the United States and abroad, including, Tsing Hua University in Beijing, the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva, Mexico, Cuba, The Hague and Turkey.

Throughout his career Wright served as president of several scholarly bodies, including the American Association of University Professors (1944–1946), the American Political Science Association (1948–1949), the International Political Science Association (1950–1952), and the American Society of International Law (1955–1956). He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1943. He was a member of the editorial board of the American Association of International Law from 1923 until his death. He was also active in the U.S. United Nations Association.

Wright&#x27;s father was the economist Philip Green Wright and his brothers were the geneticist Sewall Wright and the aeronautical engineer Theodore Paul Wright.

== Academic work ==
During the 1920s, the horrors of World War I were foremost in the thoughts of many social scientists. Soon after his arrival at Chicago, Wright organized an ongoing interdisciplinary study of wars, which eventually resulted in over 40 dissertations and 10 books. Wright summarized this research in his magnum opus &quot;A Study of War&quot; (1942).

According to Karl Deutsch of Harvard University,

Wright&#x27;s study of warfare inspired many social scientists and his database of wars is an indispensable resource for anyone seriously interested in quantitative studies of human conflicts.

Other than &quot;A Study of War&quot;, Wright published a further 20 books and nearly 400 journal articles during his career. Several of his books became standard texts, including &quot;Mandates Under the League of Nations&quot; (1930) and &quot;The Study of International Relations&quot; (1955). In &quot;The Study of International Relations&quot;, Wright distinguished between eight root disciplines of international relations: &quot;international law, diplomatic history, military science, international politics, international organization, international trade, colonial government, and the conduct of foreign relations.&quot; These disciplines were supplemented by the following specialties: &quot;world history, world geography, pacifism, the psychology and sociology of international relations; humanistic, social, and biological disciplines; and the recent development of regional studies, operational research, and group dynamics.&quot; In a review of the book, Harold Lasswell wrote that Wright sought to provide a common frame for the study of world politics and to halt an emerging trend towards increased specialization.

Wright was a prominent legal expert on the mandates system. While conducting research for &quot;Mandates Under the League of Nations&quot; (1930), which was funded by a Guggenheim Foundation grant, Wright visited Damascus less than two weeks after it had been shelled during the Great Syrian Revolt. His experiences in Damascus shaped his views on the mandates system and colonialism. Wright rebutted notions that Syrians were barbarians who could not govern themselves. He argued that the Syrian rebels were a state in the making and that French actions to repress the Syrians were a &quot;policy of terrorism&quot; and war crimes. Wright rebutted notions that Syrians were not protected by international law.

<doc id="750310" wikidata="Q6982625" url="?curid=750310" title="Navy E Ribbon">
<text>The Navy &quot;E&quot; Ribbon or Battle Efficiency Ribbon (informally the Battle &quot;E&quot; ribbon) was authorized on March 31, 1976, by Secretary of the Navy J. William Middendorf as a unit award for battle efficiency competition. The service ribbon replaced the &quot;E&quot; patch previously sewn on the right sleeve of the enlisted naval uniform for rates/pay grades E-1 through E-6.

== History ==
The Navy &quot;E&quot; Ribbon was designed by AZ3 Cynthia L. Crider in 1973. Her design and recommendation were approved by the Secretary of the Navy after three years, and the ribbon was subsequently created by the Department of the Army, which has the final approval for the design and colors of all ribbons and medals in the U.S. military. Serving with Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron 88 (VAW-88), a Naval Air Reserve E-2 Hawkeye squadron at NAS North Island, California, Petty Officer Crider designed the ribbon after her squadron won the &quot;E&quot; award for the second time in a row, but with the new uniform change could not wear anything on their uniforms to show they had been awarded the Navy &quot;E&quot; two consecutive times.

==Award criteria ==
The Navy &quot;E&quot; Ribbon denotes the wearer was on permanent duty aboard a U.S. Navy ship or in a unit that won a battle efficiency competition after July 1, 1974. United States Marine Corps members assigned as ship&#x27;s company are eligible on the same basis as Navy personnel; Marine Corps (and other sister-Service) personnel assigned to embarked units, such as aircraft squadrons, battalion landing teams, and Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU) are not eligible to wear the ribbon.

The Navy &quot;E&quot; Ribbon does not have a corresponding medal, meaning that when in full dress uniform (when medals are worn), the ribbon is placed above the right breast pocket of the uniform instead of the left. However, when in standard uniform (no medals are worn), the ribbon is placed above the left breast pocket, along with all other citations and awards.

The United States Coast Guard&#x27;s equivalent of the Navy &quot;E&quot; Ribbon is the Coast Guard &quot;E&quot; Ribbon.

== Navy &quot;E&quot; device ==

The first, second, and third award of the Navy &quot;E&quot; (Battle &quot;E&quot;) are denoted by a silver inch letter &quot;E&quot; device on the Navy &quot;E&quot; Ribbon for each award. When a sailor or Marine receives a fourth Navy &quot;E&quot; award, a silver wreathed letter &quot;E&quot; replaces the three &quot;E&quot; devices on the ribbon. The wreathed &quot;E&quot; effectively &quot;closes out&quot; the award ribbon — no further &quot;E&quot; devices are authorized for display to denote five or more awards of the Navy &quot;E&quot;. Multiple &quot;E&quot; ribbon attachments are placed in a symmetrical, horizontal line in the center of the ribbon.

<text>Robert Charles Wright (born April 23, 1943) is an American lawyer, businessman, lobbyist, and author. He is a former NBC executive, having served as president and CEO from 1986 to 2001, and chairman and CEO from 2001 until he retired in 2007. He has been credited with overseeing the broadcast network&#x27;s expansion into a media conglomerate and leading the company to record earnings in the 1990s. Prior to NBC, he held several posts at General Electric in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. He served as President and CEO of GE Capital, GE Financial Services 1983 to 1986 and served as GE&#x27;s vice chairman until he retired from that role in 2008.

In 2005, Wright and his wife, Suzanne Wright, founded Autism Speaks. In 2016, after his wife&#x27;s death from pancreatic cancer, Wright established the Suzanne Wright Foundation, which funds research for pancreatic cancer. Through the Suzanne Wright Foundation, he led the initiative to establish a Health Advanced Research Projects Agency, or HARPA, a government research agency modeled after the U.S. Department of Defense&#x27;s DARPA. On March 15, 2022, Public Law 117-103 was enacted authorizing the establishment of ARPA-H within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

==Early life and education==
Wright was born on April 23, 1943, in Hempstead, New York, on Long Island, the only child of Catherine Drum Wright and Gerald Franklin Wright. After graduating from Chaminade High School in Mineola, New York, Wright enrolled at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. He originally studied pre-med, but later changed his studies to major in psychology and minor in history. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965. Wright earned an LL.B. from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1968.

==Career==
===Early career===
Wright began his career with General Electric as a staff lawyer in 1969. The following year, he left GE to take a judicial clerkship for a federal judge in New Jersey. Wright joined GE again in 1973 as a lawyer for the company&#x27;s plastics unit, where he later took on several management positions. GE made a deal to acquire radio, broadcast TV and cable properties of Atlanta, Georgia-based Cox Communications in 1979 and appointed Wright as Cox Cable president and executive vice president of Cox Broadcasting. The deal did not come to fruition, however Wright remained with Cox Cable as president until 1983. Under Wright&#x27;s leadership, Cox Cable launched franchises across the U.S., including franchises in Omaha, Nebraska, Tucson, Arizona, New Orleans, Louisiana, Vancouver, Washington, suburbs near Chicago, Illinois, and Providence, Rhode Island, and a portion of Long Island, New York. Wright was a contemporary of Ted Turner (Turner Broadcasting Systems), John Malone (TCI), Chuck Dolan (Cablevision Systems) and Ralph J. Roberts (Comcast) during the early days of cable television. Wright left Cox to join GE once again in 1983, when GE chairman and CEO Jack Welch hired him to lead the company&#x27;s housewares and audio units. He was promoted to president of GE Financial Services from 1984 to 1986.

===NBC and NBC Universal===
GE named Wright the president and CEO of the National Broadcasting Company when the company acquired the broadcast network in 1986. He succeeded Grant Tinker in the role. He became chairman and CEO of NBC in 2001. He was named chairman and CEO of NBC Universal in 2004.

Upon succeeding Tinker, Wright&#x27;s main mission became finding new areas of business in addition to running a television network, and transformed the network into a media conglomerate. NBC launched CNBC in 1989 and MSNBC in 1996. Both are examples of the strategic partnerships NBC created under Wright to improve distribution and content. CNBC included a partnership with Dow Jones allowing delivery of local business and financial news in Europe and Asia; and MSNBC was a venture with Microsoft that launched a new 24-hour news network and accompanying news website to combine the two mediums.

Wright is credited with leading NBC during a time when the company became a powerful media leader, driving the company to record earnings in the 1990s. The network reported $5 billion in revenues and nearly more $1 billion in operating profits in 1996. Also under Wright, NBC acquired Universal Pictures, Telemundo and Bravo.

In the early- and mid-90s, Wright and NBC led efforts to persuade lawmakers and regulators to relax rules preventing networks from becoming multichannel program providers, obtaining certain financial interests and syndication.

General Electric named Wright as vice chairman of NBC&#x27;s then-parent company in 2000.

Under Wright, NBC completed its acquisition of Vivendi Universal Entertainment in 2004. Led by Wright, the newly formed NBCUniversal controlled seven cable networks, including USA Network and Sci-Fi Channel); 29 TV stations; film and TV studios; and theme parks.

During his career with NBC, Wright was active in opposing digital piracy, and was a founding member of the Global Leadership Group for the Business Alliance to Stop Counterfeiting and Piracy. In that role, Wright spoke at the Global Congress on Combating Counterfeiting and Piracy in Geneva, Switzerland, pushing for lawmakers and businesses to curb rising intellectual property theft in the digital age, and delivered a speech titled &quot;Technology and the Rule of Law in the Digital Age&quot; at the Media Institute in 2004. He also penned an op-ed in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; titled &quot;Stop IP theft&quot;. Wright&#x27;s speech at the Media Institute was published in the Notre Dame Journal of Law, Ethics &amp; Public Policy. His 2002 speech for the Legatus Tri-State Chapter on issues of faith and business was reprinted in &quot;50 High-Impact Speeches and Remarks.&quot;

Wright retired from NBC in 2007. When Wright first took the helm at the network, it saw operating profits of $400 million. In 2007, when he retired, NBC generated $3.1 billion in profit on $15.4 billion in revenue. He remained vice chairman of GE until his retirement from that role in 2008.

===Autism Speaks===

One of Wright&#x27;s grandchildren, Christian, was diagnosed with autism, prompting him and his wife, Suzanne, to found an advocacy group. The couple launched Autism Speaks in 2005, and Wright became its chairman. The Wrights&#x27; organization merged with Autism Coalition for Research and Education in 2005, National Alliance for Autism Research in 2006 and Cure Autism Now in 2007. In its first 9 years, Autism Speaks invested a half-billion dollars, focusing on science and research. The organization helped persuade the U.S. government to invest billions in autism research; as of 2014, Congress had dedicated more than $3 billion for autism research and monitoring. During Wright&#x27;s tenure, the organization teamed up with Google in 2014 on the MSSNG project to sequence a database of autism genomes. Wright resigned as chairman of Autism Speaks in May 2015; as of February 2016, he remained on the board as a co-founder of the organization and on its executive committee. His book, &quot;The Wright Stuff: from NBC to Autism Speaks&quot;, written with Diane Mermigas, was published March 29, 2016.

=== The Suzanne Wright Foundation ===
Bob Wright is Founder and Chairman of the Suzanne Wright Foundation, established in honor of his late wife, Suzanne, who died from pancreatic cancer on July 29, 2016. The Suzanne Wright Foundation launched CodePurple, a national awareness and advocacy campaign to fight pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer has the highest mortality rate of all major cancers. With no screening tools, the mortality rate is 92% and has seen virtually no improvement in more than 40 years. Through advocacy and awareness, the foundation&#x27;s goal was to accelerate discovery of detection tools, better treatments, and ultimately, a cure for pancreatic cancer.

The Suzanne Wright Foundation proposed a national health policy initiative to establish HARPA, the Health Advanced Research Projects Agency. HARPA would exist with HHS and leverage federal research assets and private sector tools to drive medical breakthroughs for diseases, like pancreatic cancer, that have not benefited from the current system. HARPA is modeled after the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the gold-standard for innovation and accountability. DARPA, an agency within the Department of Defense, developed The Internet, Voice Recognition Technology, GPS navigation, Night vision, Robotic Prostheses, Stealth Technology. DARPA&#x27;s success proves there is an effective government model for translating science to product. HARPA&#x27;s identical operating principles, built on urgency, leadership, high-impact investments and accountability, would advance scientific research &quot;from bench to bedside.&quot; HARPA would work within an innovation ecosystem that includes: the commercial market; biotech and healthcare companies; venture capital and philanthropy; academic institutions; and other government and regulatory agencies.

On May 22, 2018, The Suzanne Wright Foundation premiered their film The Patients Are Waiting: How HARPA Will Change Lives, in New York City. The film screening was followed by a panel hosted by Maria Bartiromo, Anchor and Global Markets Editor, FOX Business Network – FOX News Channel. Panelists included Bob Wright, Dr. Herbert Pardes, Executive Vice Chairman of NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital; Former Director NIMH, Dr. Geoffrey Ling, Col. (Ret.) Prof. of Neurology, Johns Hopkins; Founder &amp; Former Director, DARPA BTO, Jessica Morris, Co-founder of OurBrainBank, and Karen Reeves, President &amp; CMO, AZTherapies.

On March 15, 2022, Public Law 117-103 was enacted authorizing the establishment of ARPA-H within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

===Lee Equity Partners===
Lee Equity Partners, a private equity firm run by financier Thomas H. Lee, announced in January 2008 that Wright would join the company as a senior advisor. Due to Wright&#x27;s background with GE Financial Services and NBC, Wright was brought on to advise in media and financial sector deals.

===Boards and affiliations===
Wright has served on numerous boards, councils and committees. As of February 2016, he sits on the board of directors for Polo Ralph Lauren; Autism Speaks, an autism advocacy group he co-founded with his wife Suzanne; AMC Networks; Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation; and Palm Beach Fellowship of Christians &amp; Jews. He is chairman and CEO of Palm Beach Civic Association. He is a life trustee of the New York-Presbyterian Hospital.

==Honors and awards==
Wright has accepted various awards and honors during his career in media. He was inducted into the Broadcasting &amp; Cable Hall of Fame in 1996, the Cable Center&#x27;s Cable Hall of Fame in 2007 and AAF&#x27;s Advertising Hall of Fame in 2009. He received the &quot;Gold Medal Award&quot; from International Radio &amp; Television Society Foundation in 1997, the &quot;Steven J. Ross Humanitarian of the Year Award&quot; of UJA-Federation of New York in 1998, &quot;Public Service Award&quot; from the Ad Council in 2002, Broadcasters&#x27; Foundation&#x27;s &quot;Golden Mike Award&quot; in 2003, Media Institute&#x27;s 2004 &quot;Freedom of Speech Award&quot;, &quot;Humanitarian Award&quot; from the Simon Wiesenthal Center in 2005, &quot;Distinguished Leadership in Business Award&quot; from Columbia Business School in 2005, and the &quot;Visionary Award&quot; from the Museum of Television &amp; Radio in 2006. He also was awarded the Minorities in Broadcasting Training Program&#x27;s &quot;Striving for Excellence Award&quot;.
Wright and his wife Suzanne have been honored for their work with Autism Speaks. They were presented with the first-ever &quot;Double Helix Medal&quot; for Corporate Leadership from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, the New York University &quot;Child Advocacy Award&quot;, the Castle Connolly &quot;National Health Leadership Award&quot; and the American Ireland Fund &quot;Humanitarian Award&quot;. They received the &quot;Dean&#x27;s Medal&quot; from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the &quot;President&#x27;s Medal for Excellence&quot; at Boston College&#x27;s Wall Street Council Tribute Dinner and the &quot;Visionary Award&quot; at the 20th Annual Nantucket Film Festival.

<text>Rotogravure (or gravure for short) is a type of intaglio printing process, which involves engraving the image onto an image carrier. In gravure printing, the image is engraved onto a cylinder because, like offset printing and flexography, it uses a rotary printing press.

Once a staple of newspaper photo features, the rotogravure process is still used for commercial printing of magazines, postcards, and corrugated (cardboard) and other product packaging.

== History and development ==
In the 19th century, a number of developments in photography allowed the production of photo-mechanical printing plates. Henry Fox Talbot mentions in 1852 the use of a textile in the photographic process to create half-tones in the printing plate. A French patent in 1860 describes a reel-fed gravure press. A collaboration between Karel Klič and Samuel Fawcett, in Lancaster resulted in the founding of the Rembrandt Intaglio Printing Company in 1895, which company produced art prints. In 1906 they marketed the first multi-colour gravure print.

In 1912 Messrs Bruckman in Munich produced proofs for Bavarian postage stamps which went into production in 1914. Also in 1912 newspaper supplements printed by reel-fed gravure were on sale in London and Berlin (&quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; and &quot;Der Weltspiegel&quot;).

Irving Berlin&#x27;s song &quot;Easter Parade&quot; specifically refers to this type of supplements in the lines &quot;the photographers will snap us, and you&#x27;ll find that you&#x27;re in the rotogravure.&quot; And the song &quot;Hooray for Hollywood&quot; contains the line &quot;…armed with photos from local rotos&quot; referring to young actresses hoping to make it in the movie industry. In 1976, ex-Beatle Ringo Starr released an album titled &quot;Ringo&#x27;s Rotogravure&quot;.

Gravure is one of several printing techniques being actively used in the field of printed electronics.

== Process and components ==
In direct gravure printing, the ink is applied directly to the cylinder and from the cylinder it is transferred to the substrate. One printing unit consists of the following components:

* an engraved cylinder (also known as &quot;gravure cylinder&quot;) whose circumference can differ according to the layout of the product being made.
* an ink fountain
* a doctor blade assembly
* an impression roller
* a dryer

For indirect gravure processes, the engraved cylinder transfers ink in the desired areas to a transfer roller, and the transfer roller transfers it to the substrate.

=== Engraved cylinder ===
The first step of Gravure is to create the cylinder with the engraved images that need to be printed: the engraving process will create on the cylinder surface the cells that will contain the ink in order to transfer it to the paper. Since the amount of ink contained in the cells corresponds to different colour intensities on the paper, the dimensions of the cells must be carefully set: deeper or larger cells will produce more intense colours whereas smaller cells will produce less intense ones. There are three methods of photoengraving that have been used for engraving of gravure cylinders, where the cell open size or the depth of cells can be uniform or variable:

Gravure cylinders are usually made of steel and plated with copper, though other materials, e.g. ceramics can also be used. The desired pattern is achieved by engraving with a laser or a diamond tool, or by chemical etching. If the cylinder is chemically etched, a resist (in the form of a negative image) is transferred to the cylinder before etching. The resist protects the non-image areas of the cylinder from the etchant. After etching, the resist is stripped off. The operation is analogous to the manufacture of printed circuit boards. Following engraving, the cylinder is proofed and tested, reworked if necessary, and then chrome plated.

=== Process ===
While the press is in operation, the engraved cylinder is partially immersed in the ink tray, filling the recessed cells. As the cylinder rotates, it draws excess ink onto its surface and into the cells. Acting as a squeegee, the doctor blade scrapes the cylinder before it makes contact with the paper, removing the excess ink from the non-printing (non-recessed) areas and leaving in the cells the right amount of ink required. The position of the blade relative to the nip is normally variable.

Next, the substrate gets sandwiched between the impression roller and the gravure cylinder: this is where the ink gets transferred from the recessed cells to the web. The purpose of the impression roller is to apply force, ensuring that the entire substrate is brought into contact with the gravure cylinder, which in turn ensures even and maximum coverage of the ink. Once in contact with the substrate, the ink&#x27;s surface tension pulls (part of) the ink out of the cell and transfers it to the substrate.

Then the inked substrate goes through a dryer because it must be completely dry before going through the next color unit and accepting another coat of ink. A rotogravure printing press has one printing unit for each color, typically CMYK or cyan, magenta, yellow and key (printing terminology for black), but the number of units varies depending on what colors are required to produce the final image.

== Features ==
Because gravure is capable of transferring more ink to the paper than most other printing processes, it is noted for its remarkable density range (light to shadow) and hence is a process of choice for fine art and photography reproduction, though not typically as clean an image as that of offset lithography. A shortcoming of gravure is that all images, including type and &quot;solids,&quot; are actually printed as dots, and unless the ink and substrate combination is set up to allow solid areas to flow together, the screen pattern of these dots can be visible to the naked eye.

Gravure is an industrial printing process capable of consistent high quality printing. Since the Gravure printing process requires the creation of one cylinder for each colour of the final image, it is expensive for short runs and best suited for high volume printing. Typical uses include long-run magazines in excess of 1 million copies, mail order catalogs, consumer packaging, Sunday newspaper ad inserts, wallpaper and laminates for furniture where quality and consistency are desired. Another application area of gravure printing is in the flexible-packaging sector. A wide range of substrates such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, BOPP, etc. can be printed in the gravure press. Gravure printing is one of the common processes used in the converting industry.

Rotogravure presses for publication run at per second and more, with paper reel widths of over , enabling an eight-unit press to print about seven million four-color pages per hour.

The vast majority of gravure presses print on rolls (also known as webs) of paper or other substrates, rather than sheets. (Sheetfed gravure is a small, specialty market.) Rotary gravure presses are the fastest and widest presses in operation, printing everything from narrow labels to 12-foot-wide (3.66-meter-wide) rolls of vinyl flooring. For maximum efficiency, gravure presses operate at high speeds producing large diameter, wide rolls. These are then cut or slit down to the finished roll size on a slitting machine or slitter rewinder. Additional operations may be in line with a gravure press, such as saddle stitching facilities for magazine or brochure work.

=== Advantages ===
Although the rotogravure printing process is not the most popular printing process used in flexible-packaging manufacturing, it does have the ability to print on thin film such as polyester, polypropylene, nylon, and polyethylene, which come in a wide range of thicknesses, commonly 10 to 30 micrometers.

Other appreciated features include:

* printing cylinders that can last through large-volume runs without the image degrading
* good quality image reproduction
* low per-unit costs running high volume production

=== Disadvantages ===
Shortcomings of the gravure printing process include:

* high start-up costs: hundreds of thousands of copies needed to make it profitable
* rasterized lines and texts
* long lead time for cylinder preparation, which is offsite as the techniques used are so specialized
* rotogravure cylinder manufacturing utilizes hexavalent chromium electroplating. OSHA states that &quot;all hexavalent chromium compounds are considered carcinogenic to workers.&quot;

<text>Fanshawe is a novel written by American author Nathaniel Hawthorne. It was his first published work, which he published anonymously in 1828.

==Background==
Hawthorne had worked on a novel as early as his time as an undergraduate at Bowdoin College. &quot;Fanshawe&quot;, his first published novel, may or may not have been that book. &quot;Fanshawe: A Tale&quot; appeared anonymously in October 1828 from the Boston publishers Marsh and Capen. Its printing was paid for at the author&#x27;s own expense, costing him $100. The book was based on Hawthorne&#x27;s experiences as a Bowdoin College student in the early 1820s.

&quot;Fanshawe&quot; generally received positive reviews. In what may have been the first review, John Neal&#x27;s magazine &quot;The Yankee&quot; referred to it as &quot;powerful and pathetic&quot; and said that the author &quot;should be encouraged to persevering efforts by a fair prospect of future success.&quot; Sarah Josepha Hale, then editor of the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Magazine&quot;, advised potential readers buy the book rather than rely on finding it at a circulating library. As she wrote, &quot;Purchase it, reader. There is but one volume, and trust me that it is worth placing in your library.&quot; William Leggett saw further potential in the young author: &quot;The mind that produced this little, interesting volume, is capable of making great and rich additions to our native literature.&quot;

The book, however, did not sell well. After its commercial failure, Hawthorne burned the unsold copies. Hawthorne felt compelled to abandon novels, instead focusing on short stories, many of which he published anonymously in &quot;The Token&quot; annual gift book between 1830 and 1838. &quot;Fanshawe&quot; was so rare and Hawthorne was so secretive about his early attempt at a novel that after his death his wife, Sophia, insisted her husband had never written a novel with that title, despite being shown a copy. &quot;Fanshawe&quot; wasn&#x27;t republished until 1876, when it was picked up by James R. Osgood.

==Summary==

Dr. Melmoth, the president of fictional Harley College, takes into his care Ellen Langton, the daughter of his friend, Mr. Langton, who is at sea. Ellen is a young, beautiful girl and attracts the attentions of the college boys, especially Edward Walcott, a strapping though immature student, and Fanshawe, a reclusive, meek intellectual. While out walking, the three young people meet a nameless character called “the angler”, a name he gets for appearing an expert fisherman. The angler asks for a word with Ellen, tells her something in secret, and apparently flusters her. Walcott and Fanshawe become suspicious of his intentions.

We learn that the angler is an old friend of the reformed Inn owner, Hugh Crombie. The two had been at sea together, where Mr. Langton had been the angler&#x27;s mentor and caretaker. Langton and the angler had a falling out, however, and, thinking that Langton has been killed at sea, the angler undertakes to marry Ellen in order to inherit her father&#x27;s considerable wealth. Thus in his secret meeting with Ellen, the angler instructs her to sneak out of Melmoth&#x27;s home and follow him, telling her he has information about her father’s whereabouts. His real aim, though, is to kidnap her, to tell her of her father’s death, and to manipulate her into marrying him.

When the various men (Melmoth, Edward, Fanshawe) learn that she is not in her chamber, they go searching for her. The search reveals the nature of each: Melmoth, an aged scholar unused to physical labor, enlists the help of Walcott, who is the most skilled rider and the most likely to be able to contend with the angler in a fight. Fanshawe, who lags behind the search because of his weak constitution and his slow horse, is given information by an old woman in a cabin (where another old woman, Widow Butler, who turns out to be the angler&#x27;s mother, has just died) that allows him to reach the angler and Ellen first. The angler has taken Ellen to a craggy cliff and cave, where he intends to hold her captive. Ellen has finally realized the angler&#x27;s intentions. When Fanshawe arrives, he stands above them, looking over the edge of the cliff. The angler begins to climb up the cliff to fight Fanshawe but grabs a twig too weak to support him and tumbles to his death. Fanshawe awakens Ellen from a faint, and they travel back to town together.

Fanshawe loves Ellen but knows that he will die young because of his shut-in lifestyle. When Langton offers Ellen&#x27;s hand in marriage to Fanshawe in exchange for rescuing her, he refuses, sacrificing his happiness so as not to subject her to a life of widowhood. He also knows that Ellen has affections for Walcott. Fanshawe dies at 20. Ellen and Walcott marry four years later. The narrator states that Walcott grows out of his childish ways (drunkenness, impulsiveness, the suggestion of teenage affairs) and becomes content with Ellen. They are, according to the narrator, happy, but the book ends on an ambivalent note, stating that the couple did not produce children.

<text>Theodore Paul Wright (May 25, 1895 – August 21, 1970), also known as T. P. Wright, was a U.S. aeronautical engineer and educator.

==Biography==

He was born in Galesburg, Illinois on May 25, 1895. His father was the economist Philip Green Wright and his brothers were the geneticist Sewall Wright and the political scientist Quincy Wright. He graduated from Lombard College and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He served in World War I.

In 1936, he published an important paper entitled &quot;Factors affecting the costs of airplanes&quot; which describes what is known as &quot;Wright&#x27;s law&quot; or experience curve effects. The paper describes that &quot;we learn by doing&quot; and that the cost of each unit produced decreases as a function of the cumulative number of units produced. 

He served as administrator of the Civil Aeronautics Administration during 1944–1948. When President Truman announced Wright’s resignation as Administrator of Civil Aeronautics on January 16, 1948, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that Wright felt he could not continue in office at a salary of $10,000 per year ().

He served as Cornell University&#x27;s vice president in charge of research from 1948 to 1960 and served as acting president of Cornell University in 1951. He died on August 21, 1970.

<text>In mathematics, a compact (topological) group is a topological group whose topology realizes it as a compact topological space (when an element of the group is operated on, the result is also within the group). Compact groups are a natural generalization of finite groups with the discrete topology and have properties that carry over in significant fashion. Compact groups have a well-understood theory, in relation to group actions and representation theory.

In the following we will assume all groups are Hausdorff spaces.

==Compact Lie groups==

Lie groups form a class of topological groups, and the compact Lie groups have a particularly well-developed theory. Basic examples of compact Lie groups include
* the circle group T and the torus groups T&quot;n&quot;,
* the orthogonal group O(&quot;n&quot;), the special orthogonal group SO(&quot;n&quot;) and its covering spin group Spin(&quot;n&quot;),
* the unitary group U(&quot;n&quot;) and the special unitary group SU(&quot;n&quot;),
* the compact forms of the exceptional Lie groups: G2, F4, E6, E7, and E8.
The classification theorem of compact Lie groups states that up to finite extensions and finite covers this exhausts the list of examples (which already includes some redundancies). This classification is described in more detail in the next subsection.

===Classification===

Given any compact Lie group &quot;G&quot; one can take its identity component &quot;G&quot;0, which is connected. The quotient group &quot;G&quot;/&quot;G&quot;0 is the group of components π0(&quot;G&quot;) which must be finite since &quot;G&quot; is compact. We therefore have a finite extension
:formula_1
Meanwhile, for connected compact Lie groups, we have the following result:
:Theorem: Every connected compact Lie group is the quotient by a finite central subgroup of a product of a simply connected compact Lie group and a torus.
Thus, the classification of connected compact Lie groups can in principle be reduced to knowledge of the simply connected compact Lie groups together with information about their centers. (For information about the center, see the section below on fundamental group and center.)

Finally, every compact, connected, simply-connected Lie group &quot;K&quot; is a product of finitely many compact, connected, simply-connected simple Lie groups &quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot; each of which is isomorphic to exactly one of the following:
*The compact symplectic group formula_2
*The special unitary group formula_3
*The spin group formula_4
or one of the five exceptional groups G2, F4, E6, E7, and E8. The restrictions on &quot;n&quot; are to avoid special isomorphisms among the various families for small values of &quot;n&quot;. For each of these groups, the center is known explicitly. The classification is through the associated root system (for a fixed maximal torus), which in turn are classified by their Dynkin diagrams.

The classification of compact, simply connected Lie groups is the same as the classification of complex semisimple Lie algebras. Indeed, if &quot;K&quot; is a simply connected compact Lie group, then the complexification of the Lie algebra of &quot;K&quot; is semisimple. Conversely, every complex semisimple Lie algebra has a compact real form isomorphic to the Lie algebra of a compact, simply connected Lie group.

===Maximal tori and root systems===

A key idea in the study of a connected compact Lie group &quot;K&quot; is the concept of a &quot;maximal torus&quot;, that is a subgroup &quot;T&quot; of &quot;K&quot; that is isomorphic to a product of several copies of formula_5 and that is not contained in any larger subgroup of this type. A basic example is the case formula_6, in which case we may take formula_7 to be the group of diagonal elements in formula_8. A basic result is the &quot;torus theorem&quot; which states that every element of formula_8 belongs to a maximal torus and that all maximal tori are conjugate.

The maximal torus in a compact group plays a role analogous to that of the Cartan subalgebra in a complex semisimple Lie algebra. In particular, once a maximal torus formula_10 has been chosen, one can define a root system and a Weyl group similar to what one has for semisimple Lie algebras. These structures then play an essential role both in the classification of connected compact groups (described above) and in the representation theory of a fixed such group (described below).

The root systems associated to the simple compact groups appearing in the classification of simply connected compact groups are as follows:
*The special unitary groups formula_11 correspond to the root system formula_12
*The odd spin groups formula_13 correspond to the root system formula_14
*The compact symplectic groups formula_15 correspond to the root system formula_16
*The even spin groups formula_17 correspond to the root system formula_18
*The exceptional compact Lie groups correspond to the five exceptional root systems G2, F4, E6, E7, or E8

===Fundamental group and center===

It is important to know whether a connected compact Lie group is simply connected, and if not, to determine its fundamental group. For compact Lie groups, there are two basic approaches to computing the fundamental group. The first approach applies to the classical compact groups formula_11, formula_20, formula_21, and formula_15 and proceeds by induction on formula_23. The second approach uses the root system and applies to all connected compact Lie groups.

It is also important to know the center of a connected compact Lie group. The center of a classical group formula_24 can easily be computed &quot;by hand,&quot; and in most cases consists simply of whatever roots of the identity are in formula_24. (The group SO(2) is an exception—the center is the whole group, even though most elements are not roots of the identity.) Thus, for example, the center of formula_11 consists of &quot;n&quot;th roots of unity times the identity, a cyclic group of order formula_23.

In general, the center can be expressed in terms of the root lattice and the kernel of the exponential map for the maximal torus. The general method shows, for example, that the simply connected compact group corresponding to the exceptional root system formula_28 has trivial center. Thus, the compact formula_28 group is one of very few simple compact groups that are simultaneously simply connected and center free. (The others are formula_30 and formula_31.)

==Further examples==

Amongst groups that are not Lie groups, and so do not carry the structure of a manifold, examples are the additive group &quot;Z&quot;&quot;p&quot; of p-adic integers, and constructions from it. In fact any profinite group is a compact group. This means that Galois groups are compact groups, a basic fact for the theory of algebraic extensions in the case of infinite degree.

Pontryagin duality provides a large supply of examples of compact commutative groups. These are in duality with abelian discrete groups.

==Haar measure==

Compact groups all carry a Haar measure, which will be invariant by both left and right translation (the modulus function must be a continuous homomorphism to positive reals (R+, ×), and so 1). In other words, these groups are unimodular. Haar measure is easily normalized to be a probability measure, analogous to dθ/2π on the circle.

Such a Haar measure is in many cases easy to compute; for example for orthogonal groups it was known to Adolf Hurwitz, and in the Lie group cases can always be given by an invariant differential form. In the profinite case there are many subgroups of finite index, and Haar measure of a coset will be the reciprocal of the index. Therefore, integrals are often computable quite directly, a fact applied constantly in number theory.

If formula_8 is a compact group and formula_33 is the associated Haar measure, the Peter–Weyl theorem provides a decomposition of formula_34 as an orthogonal direct sum of finite-dimensional subspaces of matrix entries for the irreducible representations of formula_8.

==Representation theory==

The representation theory of compact groups (not necessarily Lie groups and not necessarily connected) was founded by the Peter–Weyl theorem. Hermann Weyl went on to give the detailed character theory of the compact connected Lie groups, based on maximal torus theory. The resulting Weyl character formula was one of the influential results of twentieth century mathematics. The combination of the Peter–Weyl theorem and the Weyl character formula led Weyl to a complete classification of the representations of a connected compact Lie group; this theory is described in the next section.

A combination of Weyl&#x27;s work and Cartan&#x27;s theorem gives a survey of the whole representation theory of compact groups &quot;G&quot;. That is, by the Peter–Weyl theorem the irreducible unitary representations ρ of &quot;G&quot; are into a unitary group (of finite dimension) and the image will be a closed subgroup of the unitary group by compactness. Cartan&#x27;s theorem states that Im(ρ) must itself be a Lie subgroup in the unitary group. If &quot;G&quot; is not itself a Lie group, there must be a kernel to ρ. Further one can form an inverse system, for the kernel of ρ smaller and smaller, of finite-dimensional unitary representations, which identifies &quot;G&quot; as an inverse limit of compact Lie groups. Here the fact that in the limit a faithful representation of &quot;G&quot; is found is another consequence of the Peter–Weyl theorem.

The unknown part of the representation theory of compact groups is thereby, roughly speaking, thrown back onto the complex representations of finite groups. This theory is rather rich in detail, but is qualitatively well understood.

==Representation theory of a connected compact Lie group==
Certain simple examples of the representation theory of compact Lie groups can be worked out by hand, such as the representations of the rotation group SO(3), the special unitary group SU(2), and the special unitary group SU(3). We focus here on the general theory. See also the parallel theory of representations of a semisimple Lie algebra.

Throughout this section, we fix a connected compact Lie group &quot;K&quot; and a maximal torus &quot;T&quot; in &quot;K&quot;.

===Representation theory of &quot;T&quot;===
Since &quot;T&quot; is commutative, Schur&#x27;s lemma tells us that each irreducible representation formula_36 of &quot;T&quot; is one-dimensional:
:formula_37
Since, also, &quot;T&quot; is compact, formula_36 must actually map into formula_39.

To describe these representations concretely, we let formula_40 be the Lie algebra of &quot;T&quot; and we write points formula_41 as
:formula_42
In such coordinates, formula_36 will have the form
:formula_44
for some linear functional formula_45 on formula_40.

Now, since the exponential map formula_47 is not injective, not every such linear functional formula_45 gives rise to a well-defined map of &quot;T&quot; into formula_5. Rather, let formula_50 denote the kernel of the exponential map:
:formula_51
where formula_52 is the identity element of &quot;T&quot;. (We scale the exponential map here by a factor of formula_53 in order to avoid such factors elsewhere.) 
Then for formula_45 to give a well-defined map formula_36, formula_45 must satisfy
:formula_57
where formula_58 is the set of integers. A linear functional formula_45 satisfying this condition is called an analytically integral element. This integrality condition is related to, but not identical to, the notion of integral element in the setting of semisimple Lie algebras.

Suppose, for example, &quot;T&quot; is just the group formula_5 of complex numbers formula_61 of absolute value 1. The Lie algebra is the set of purely imaginary numbers, formula_62 and the kernel of the (scaled) exponential map is the set of numbers of the form formula_63 where formula_23 is an integer. A linear functional formula_45 takes integer values on all such numbers if and only if it is of the form formula_66 for some integer formula_67. The irreducible representations of &quot;T&quot; in this case are one-dimensional and of the form
:formula_68

===Representation theory of &quot;K&quot;===


We now let formula_69 denote a finite-dimensional irreducible representation of &quot;K&quot; (over formula_70). We then consider the restriction of formula_69 to &quot;T&quot;. This restriction is not irreducible unless formula_69 is one-dimensional. Nevertheless, the restriction decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations of &quot;T&quot;. (Note that a given irreducible representation of &quot;T&quot; may occur more than once.) Now, each irreducible representation of &quot;T&quot; is described by a linear functional formula_45 as in the preceding subsection. If a given formula_45 occurs at least once in the decomposition of the restriction of formula_69 to &quot;T&quot;, we call formula_45 a weight of formula_69. The strategy of the representation theory of &quot;K&quot; is to classify the irreducible representations in terms of their weights.

We now briefly describe the structures needed to formulate the theorem; more details can be found in the article on weights in representation theory. We need the notion of a root system for &quot;K&quot; (relative to a given maximal torus &quot;T&quot;). The construction of this root system formula_78 is very similar to the construction for complex semisimple Lie algebras. Specifically, the weights are the nonzero weights for the adjoint action of &quot;T&quot; on the complexified Lie algebra of &quot;K&quot;. The root system &quot;R&quot; has all the usual properties of a root system, except that the elements of &quot;R&quot; may not span formula_40. We then choose a base formula_80 for &quot;R&quot; and we say that an integral element formula_45 is dominant if formula_82 for all formula_83. Finally, we say that one weight is higher than another if their difference can be expressed as a linear combination of elements of formula_80 with non-negative coefficients.

The irreducible finite-dimensional representations of &quot;K&quot; are then classified by a theorem of the highest weight, which is closely related to the analogous theorem classifying representations of a semisimple Lie algebra. The result says that: 
# every irreducible representation has highest weight, 
# the highest weight is always a dominant, analytically integral element, 
# two irreducible representations with the same highest weight are isomorphic, and 
# every dominant, analytically integral element arises as the highest weight of an irreducible representation.

The theorem of the highest weight for representations of &quot;K&quot; is then almost the same as for semisimple Lie algebras, with one notable exception: The concept of an integral element is different. The weights formula_45 of a representation formula_69 are analytically integral in the sense described in the previous subsection. Every analytically integral element is integral in the Lie algebra sense, but not the other way around. (This phenomenon reflects that, in general, not every representation of the Lie algebra formula_87 comes from a representation of the group &quot;K&quot;.) On the other hand, if &quot;K&quot; is simply connected, the set of possible highest weights in the group sense is the same as the set of possible highest weights in the Lie algebra sense.

===The Weyl character formula===

If formula_88 is representation of &quot;K&quot;, we define the character of formula_89 to be the function formula_90 given by
:formula_91.
This function is easily seen to be a class function, i.e., formula_92 for all formula_93 and formula_94 in &quot;K&quot;. Thus, formula_95 is determined by its restriction to &quot;T&quot;.

The study of characters is an important part of the representation theory of compact groups. One crucial result, which is a corollary of the Peter–Weyl theorem, is that the characters form an orthonormal basis for the set of square-integrable class functions in &quot;K&quot;. A second key result is the Weyl character formula, which gives an explicit formula for the character—or, rather, the restriction of the character to &quot;T&quot;—in terms of the highest weight of the representation.

In the closely related representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras, the Weyl character formula is an additional result established &quot;after&quot; the representations have been classified. In Weyl&#x27;s analysis of the compact group case, however, the Weyl character formula is actually a crucial part of the classification itself. Specifically, in Weyl&#x27;s analysis of the representations of &quot;K&quot;, the hardest part of the theorem—showing that every dominant, analytically integral element is actually the highest weight of some representation—is proved in a totally different way from the usual Lie algebra construction using Verma modules. In Weyl&#x27;s approach, the construction is based on the Peter–Weyl theorem and an analytic proof of the Weyl character formula. Ultimately, the irreducible representations of &quot;K&quot; are realized inside the space of continuous functions on &quot;K&quot;.

===The SU(2) case===
We now consider the case of the compact group SU(2). The representations are often considered from the Lie algebra point of view, but we here look at them from the group point of view. We take the maximal torus to be the set of matrices of the form
:formula_96
According to the example discussed above in the section on representations of &quot;T&quot;, the analytically integral elements are labeled by integers, so that the dominant, analytically integral elements are non-negative integers formula_33. The general theory then tells us that for each formula_33, there is a unique irreducible representation of SU(2) with highest weight formula_33.

Much information about the representation corresponding to a given formula_33 is encoded in its character. Now, the Weyl character formula says, in this case, that the character is given by
:formula_101
We can also write the character as sum of exponentials as follows:
:formula_102
(If we use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series on the above expression and simplify, we obtain the earlier expression.)

From this last expression and the standard formula for the character in terms of the weights of the representation, we can read off that the weights of the representation are 
:formula_103
each with multiplicity one. (The weights are the integers appearing in the exponents of the exponentials and the multiplicities are the coefficients of the exponentials.) Since there are formula_104 weights, each with multiplicity 1, the dimension of the representation is formula_104. Thus, we recover much of the information about the representations that is usually obtained from the Lie algebra computation.

===An outline of the proof===
We now outline the proof of the theorem of the highest weight, following the original argument of Hermann Weyl. We continue to let formula_8 be a connected compact Lie group and formula_7 a fixed maximal torus in formula_8. We focus on the most difficult part of the theorem, showing that every dominant, analytically integral element is the highest weight of some (finite-dimensional) irreducible representation.

The tools for the proof are the following:
*The torus theorem.
*The Weyl integral formula.
*The Peter–Weyl theorem for class functions, which states that the characters of the irreducible representations form an orthonormal basis for the space of square integrable class functions on formula_8.

With these tools in hand, we proceed with the proof. The first major step in the argument is to prove the Weyl character formula. The formula states that if formula_89 is an irreducible representation with highest weight formula_45, then the character formula_95 of formula_89 satisfies:
: formula_114
for all formula_115 in the Lie algebra of formula_7. Here formula_36 is half the sum of the positive roots. (The notation uses the convention of &quot;real weights&quot;; this convention requires an explicit factor of formula_118 in the exponent.) Weyl&#x27;s proof of the character formula is analytic in nature and hinges on the fact that the formula_119 norm of the character is 1. Specifically, if there were any additional terms in the numerator, the Weyl integral formula would force the norm of the character to be greater than 1.

Next, we let formula_120 denote the function on the right-hand side of the character formula. We show that &quot;even if formula_45 is not known to be the highest weight of a representation&quot;, formula_120 is a well-defined, Weyl-invariant function on formula_7, which therefore extends to a class function on formula_8. Then using the Weyl integral formula, one can show that as formula_45 ranges over the set of dominant, analytically integral elements, the functions formula_120 form an orthonormal family of class functions. We emphasize that we do not currently know that every such formula_45 is the highest weight of a representation; nevertheless, the expressions on the right-hand side of the character formula gives a well-defined set of functions formula_120, and these functions are orthonormal.

Now comes the conclusion. The set of all formula_120—with formula_45 ranging over the dominant, analytically integral elements—forms an orthonormal set in the space of square integrable class functions. But by the Weyl character formula, the characters of the irreducible representations form a subset of the formula_120&#x27;s. And by the Peter–Weyl theorem, the characters of the irreducible representations form an orthonormal basis for the space of square integrable class functions. If there were some formula_45 that is not the highest weight of a representation, then the corresponding formula_120 would not be the character of a representation. Thus, the characters would be a &quot;proper&quot; subset of the set of formula_120&#x27;s. But then we have an impossible situation: an orthonormal &quot;basis&quot; (the set of characters of the irreducible representations) would be contained in a strictly larger orthonormal set (the set of formula_120&#x27;s). Thus, every formula_45 must actually be the highest weight of a representation.

==Duality==

The topic of recovering a compact group from its representation theory is the subject of the Tannaka–Krein duality, now often recast in terms of Tannakian category theory.

==From compact to non-compact groups==

The influence of the compact group theory on non-compact groups was formulated by Weyl in his unitarian trick. Inside a general semisimple Lie group there is a maximal compact subgroup, and the representation theory of such groups, developed largely by Harish-Chandra, uses intensively the restriction of a representation to such a subgroup, and also the model of Weyl&#x27;s character theory.

<text>S. S. Van Dine (also styled S.S. Van Dine) is the pen name used by American art critic Willard Huntington Wright (October 15, 1888 – April 11, 1939) when he wrote detective novels. Wright was active in avant-garde cultural circles in pre-World War I New York, and under the pen name (which he originally used to conceal his identity) he created the fictional detective Philo Vance, a sleuth and aesthete who first appeared in books in the 1920s, then in films and on the radio.

==Early life==
Willard Huntington Wright was born to Archibald Davenport Wright and Annie Van Vranken Wright on October 15, 1888, in Charlottesville, Virginia. His younger brother, Stanton Macdonald-Wright, became a respected painter, one of the first American abstract artists, and co-founder (with Morgan Russell) of the school of modern art known as &quot;Synchromism&quot;. Willard and Stanton were raised in Santa Monica, California, where their father owned a hotel. Willard, a largely self-taught writer, attended St. Vincent College, Pomona College, and Harvard University without graduating. In 1907, he married Katharine Belle Boynton of Seattle, Washington; they had one child, Beverley. He abandoned Katherine and Beverley early in their marriage. Katharine was granted a divorce in October 1930. he married for a second time in October 1930. His second wife was Eleanor Rulapaugh, known professionally as Claire De Lisle, a portrait painter and socialite.

==Writing career==
At age 21, Wright began his professional writing career as literary editor of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, where – describing himself as &quot;&#x27;Esthetic expert and psychological shark&quot; – he was known for his scathing book reviews and irreverent opinions. He was particularly caustic about romance and detective fiction. His friend and mentor H.L. Mencken was an early inspiration. Other important literary influences included Oscar Wilde and Ambrose Bierce. Wright was an advocate of the naturalism of Theodore Dreiser, and Wright&#x27;s own novel, &quot;The Man of Promise&quot; (1916), was written in a similar style.

In 1909, Wright wrote a perceptive profile of Edgar Allan Poe for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. Wright moved to New York City in 1911. He published realist fiction as editor of the New York literary magazine &quot;The Smart Set,&quot; from 1912 to 1914, a job he attained with Mencken&#x27;s help. He was fired from that position when the magazine&#x27;s conservative owner felt that Wright was intentionally provoking their middle-class readership with his interest in unconventional and often sexually explicit fiction. In his two-year tenure, Wright published short stories by Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio, Floyd Dell, Ford Madox Ford, D.H. Lawrence, and George Moore; a play by Joseph Conrad; and poems by Ezra Pound and William Butler Yeats.

In 1913, he visited Paris and Munich, seeing Impressionist and Synchromist works of art. He wrote an article about the art, &quot;Impressionism to Synchromism&quot;, December 1913, published in &quot;New York&quot; magazine, which brought the abstract art to public attention in the US.

Wright&#x27;s many projects reflected his wide range of interests. His book &quot;What Nietzsche Taught&quot; appeared in 1915. An attempt to popularize the German philosopher with skeptical American audiences, it described and commented on all of Nietzsche&#x27;s books and provided quotations from each work. Wright continued to write short stories in this period; in 2012, Brooks Hefner revealed heretofore unknown short stories that featured an intellectual criminal, written by Wright under a pseudonym several years before his adoption of the Van Dine pseudonym.
Wright was, however, most respected in intellectual circles for his writing about art. In &quot;Modern Painting: Its Tendency and Meaning&quot; (secretly co-authored in 1915 with his brother Stanton), he surveyed the important art movements of the last hundred years from Manet to Cubism, praised the largely unknown work of Cézanne, and predicted a coming era in which an art of color abstraction would replace realism. Admired by Alfred Stieglitz and Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe among others, Wright became under his brother&#x27;s tutelage one of the most progressive (and belligerently opinionated) art critics of the time and helped to organize several shows, including the &quot;Forum Exhibition of Modern American Painters&quot;, bringing the most advanced new painters to the attention of audiences on both coasts. He also published a work of aesthetic philosophy, &quot;The Creative Will&quot; (1916), that O&#x27;Keeffe and William Faulkner both regarded as a meaningful influence on their thinking about artistic identity.

In 1917, Wright published &quot;&quot;, in which he mounted a blistering attack on alleged inaccuracies and British biases in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition&quot;. A Germanophile, Wright did not support America&#x27;s decision to join the Allied cause in World War I, and he was blackballed from journalism for more than two years after an overzealous secretary (erroneously) accused him of spying for Germany, an episode that became a much-publicized scandal in New York in November 1917. Though cleared, his favourable view of Prussian militarism cost him his friendships with Mencken and Dreiser. In 1929, at the height of his fame as &#x27;Philo Vance&#x27;, he was appointed Police Commissioner of Bradley Beach, New Jersey. After suffering a nervous breakdown and the beginning of a long-term dependence on drugs, Wright retreated to California, where he attempted to make a living as a newspaper columnist in San Francisco. Contrary to what is stated in some sources, Wright did write a biography of the poet Richard Hovey and it was announced for publication in Spring 1914. In 1929, Wright stated that &quot;It is true that at one time I was working on a book relating to Richard Hovey and his friends but Mrs Hovey died before the book went to press, and it has never been published&quot;; that remains the case.

==Detective fiction==
Returning to New York in 1920, Wright took any freelance work that came his way but lived a restless, impoverished existence and, in his displays of temper and anxiety, alienated many of his old friends. By 1923, he was seriously ill, the result of a breakdown from overwork, he claimed, but in reality the consequence of his secret cocaine addiction, according to John Loughery&#x27;s biography &quot;Alias S.S. Van Dine&quot;. Confined to bed for a prolonged period of recovery, he began in frustration and boredom reading hundreds of volumes of crime and detection. As a direct result of this exhaustive study, he wrote a seminal essay, published in 1926, which explored the history, traditions and conventions of detective fiction as an art form. Wright also decided to try his own hand at detective fiction and approached Maxwell Perkins, the famous Scribner&#x27;s editor whom he had known at Harvard, with an outline for a trilogy that would feature an affluent, snobbish amateur sleuth, a Jazz Age Manhattan setting, and lively topical references. In 1926, the first Philo Vance book, &quot;The Benson Murder Case,&quot; was published under the pseudonym &quot;S.S. Van Dine&quot;. Within two years, following the publication of &quot;The Canary Murder Case&quot; and &quot;The Greene Murder Case,&quot; Wright was one of the best-selling authors in the United States.

Frankly embarrassed by his turn from intellectual pursuits to mass market fiction, Wright never wanted to publish under his own name. He took his pseudonym from the abbreviation of &quot;steamship&quot; and from Van Dine, which he claimed was an old family name. According to Loughery, however, &quot;there are no Van Dines evident in the family tree&quot; (p. 176). He wrote twelve mysteries in total, though their author&#x27;s identity was unmasked by 1928. The first few books about the distinctive Philo Vance (who shared with his creator a love of art and a disdain for the common touch) sold many copies, leading Wright to become wealthy for the first time in his life. His readership was diverse and worldwide. David Shavit&#x27;s study of World War II POW reading habits revealed that Vance was one of the favorite detectives among officer POWs. However, according to critic Julian Symons:

Wright&#x27;s later books declined in both quality and popularity. The reading public&#x27;s tastes changed, and the &quot;hard-boiled&quot; school of detective fiction became the dominant style in the 1930s. The new mood was captured by Ogden Nash in his brief verse:

&lt;poem&gt;
Philo Vance
Needs a kick in the pance.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Philo Vance and Sam Spade occupy different aesthetic universes. Wright continued to make money, though, and by the end of the decade, he saw himself caught in a trap from which he could not escape: in the midst of the Great Depression, he could not return to literary journalism and art criticism which paid very little, now that he and his wife were accustomed to an extravagant way of life, and yet he no longer believed in the kind of novels he was producing each year in order to maintain that way of life.

==Study of detective fiction==
Wright&#x27;s lengthy introduction and notes to the anthology &quot;The World&#x27;s Great Detective Stories&quot; (1927) are important in the history of the critical study of detective fiction. Although dated by the passage of time, this essay is still a core around which many other such commentaries have been constructed. He also wrote an article, &quot;Twenty Rules for Writing Detective Stories&quot;, in 1928 for &quot;The American Magazine&quot; It has been frequently reprinted and compared to &quot;Knox&#x27;s (Ten) Commandments&quot; by Ronald Knox.

==Short film series==
Wright wrote scenarios for Warner Brothers film studio in the early 1930s. These were used as the basis for a series of 12 two-reel &quot;murder mystery&quot; films, each approximately 20 minutes long, which were released in 1931–1932. Of these, &quot;The Skull Murder Mystery&quot; shows Wright&#x27;s vigorous plot construction. It features a non-stereotypical treatment of its Chinese characters, something quite unusual in its day.

Donald Meek (as Dr. Crabtree) and John Hamilton (as Inspector Carr) were featured players, with Joseph Henabery directing. Three titles (&quot;The Wall Street Mystery&quot;, &quot;The Studio Murder Mystery&quot;, and the &quot;Trans-Atlantic Murder Mystery&quot;) have been released on DVD as extras on &quot;Forbidden Hollywood Collection Volume 3&quot; (Warner).

As far as it is known, none of Van Dine&#x27;s screen treatments has been published in book form, and none of the manuscripts survive. Short films were a common part of theatre screenings at the time, and Hollywood made hundreds of them during the studio era.

On 13 September 1932, a $500,000 plagiarism suit was filed against Van Dine and the Vitaphone Film Company by Arlo Channing Edington and Carmen Ballen Edington who charged that their novel, &quot;The Studio Murder Mystery&quot;, which had been filmed by Paramount in 1929, had been &quot;&#x27;lifted&#x27; – title, plot and incident&quot; and produced by the film company, credited to Van Dine. The action was unsuccessful.

==Late career and death==
From a monetary perspective, Wright was fortunate in his experiences with Hollywood, and he was lionized on his visits to the movie capital. All but two of his novels were adapted as feature-length films, and the role of Philo Vance was played by stars such as William Powell (before his Nick Charles period), Basil Rathbone, and Edmund Lowe. Louise Brooks (in &quot;The Canary Murder Case&quot;), Jean Arthur (in &quot;The Greene Murder Case&quot;), and Rosalind Russell (in &quot;The Casino Murder Case&quot;) appeared in the S.S. Van Dine movies.

On April 11, 1939, at age 50, Wright died in New York of a heart condition exacerbated by excessive drinking, a year after the publication of an unpopular experimental novel incorporating one of the biggest stars in radio comedy, &quot;The Gracie Allen Murder Case&quot;. He left behind a complete novelette-length story intended for a Sonja Henie film vehicle, which was published posthumously as &quot;The Winter Murder Case&quot;. Max Perkins generously referred to Wright as a &quot;gallant, gentle man&quot; at the time of his death who had been tormented by the pressures of a market-driven age. His portrait, painted by his brother in 1914, hangs in the permanent collection of the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.

<text>William Mills Wrigley Jr. (September 30, 1861 – January 26, 1932) was an American chewing gum industrialist. He founded the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company in 1891.

==Biography==

William Mills Wrigley Jr. was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on September 30, 1861, the son of Mary Ann (née Ladley) and William Mills Wrigley Sr. His family members were Quakers of English descent.

In 1891, Wrigley moved from Philadelphia to Chicago to go into business for himself. He had $32 to his name (equivalent to ~$1000 in 2023) and with it, he formed a business to sell Wrigley&#x27;s Scouring Soap. He offered customers small premiums, particularly baking powder, as an incentive to buy his soap. Finding the baking powder was more popular than his soap, Wrigley switched to selling baking powder, and giving his customers two packages of chewing gum for each can of baking powder they purchased. Again, Wrigley found that the premium he offered was more popular than his base product, and his company began to concentrate on the manufacture and sale of chewing gum. In this business, Wrigley made his name and fortune.

Wrigley played an instrumental role in the development of Santa Catalina Island, California, off the shore of Long Beach, California. He bought a controlling interest in the Santa Catalina Island Company in 1919 and with the company received the island. Wrigley improved the island with public utilities, new steamships, a hotel, the Casino building, and extensive plantings of trees, shrubs, and flowers. He also sought to create an enterprise that would help employ local residents. By making use of clay and minerals found on the island at a beach near Avalon, in 1927 William Wrigley Jr. created the Pebbly Beach quarry and tile plant. Along with creating jobs for Avalon residents, the plant also supplied material for Wrigley&#x27;s numerous building projects on the island. After building the Avalon Casino in 1929, the Catalina Clay Products Tile and Pottery Plant began producing glazed tiles, dinnerware and other household items such as bookends.

Another of Wrigley&#x27;s legacies was his plan for the future of Catalina Island—that it be protected for future generations to enjoy. In 1972, his son, Philip K. Wrigley, established the Catalina Island Conservancy for this purpose and transferred all family ownership to it. Wrigley is honored by the Wrigley Memorial in the Wrigley Botanical Gardens on the island.

The Wrigley district of Long Beach, California bears his name.
In 1916, Wrigley bought a minority stake in the Chicago Cubs baseball team as part of a group headed by Charles Weeghman, former owner of the Federal League&#x27;s Chicago Whales. Over the next four years, as Weeghman&#x27;s lunch-counter business declined, he was forced to sell much of his stock in the ball club to Wrigley. By 1918, Weeghman had sold all of his stock to Wrigley, making Wrigley the largest shareholder and principal owner, and by 1921, Wrigley was majority owner. Wrigley Field, the Cubs&#x27; ballpark in Chicago, was renamed for him in 1926, and has continued to bear the name to this day. The now-demolished former home of the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League, at that time the Cubs&#x27; top farm team, was also called Wrigley Field. Wrigley purchased full control of the Cubs from Albert Lasker in 1925.

In 1930, Wrigley gave the Salvation Army use of a six-story factory building he owned in Chicago to use as a lodging house for the unemployed. He donated the building, then called New Start Lodge, to the Salvation Army outright the following year. It was renamed Wrigley Lodge later that year.

The Arizona Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona was partially financed and wholly owned by Wrigley, who finished the nearby Wrigley Mansion as a winter cottage in 1931. At , it was the smallest of his five residences.

==Death==
William Wrigley Jr. died on January 26, 1932, at his Phoenix mansion, at age 70. He was stricken by acute indigestion, complicated by a heart attack and apoplexy. He was interred in his custom-designed sarcophagus located in the tower of the Wrigley Memorial &amp; Botanical Gardens near his beloved home on California&#x27;s Catalina Island. In 1947, Wrigley&#x27;s remains were moved to allow the gardens to be made public. There is a rumor that the remains were moved during World War II due to &quot;wartime security concerns&quot;. His original grave memorial marker still adorns the tower site. Wrigley was reinterred in the corridor alcove end of the Sanctuary of Gratitude, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

His estate, estimated to be worth , went to daughter Dorothy Wrigley Offield and son Philip K. Wrigley. The son continued to run the company until his death in 1977. His ashes were interred near his father, in the same Sanctuary of Gratitude alcove.

Wrigley Jr. was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 2000.

His great-grandson, William Wrigley Jr. II, was the executive chairman and CEO of the Wrigley Company from 1999 until 2006, when he turned it over to William Perez, the first non-Wrigley head of the company.

<text>Brigadier Allan Lawrence Mallinson (born 6 February 1949) is an English author and retired British Army officer.

Mallinson is best known for writing a series of novels chronicling the (fictional) life of Matthew Hervey, an officer serving in the (fictional) British 6th Light Dragoons from the late Napoleonic Wars through subsequent colonial conflicts in India, North America and South Africa.

==Early life==
Mallinson was born on 6 February 1949 in Yorkshire, England, to Alfred and Edith Mallinson. From 1966, he trained for the Anglican priesthood at St Chad&#x27;s College in Durham.

==Military career==
Mallinson took a break from his theological studies to join the Army in 1969, joining the King&#x27;s Own Royal Border Regiment as a Second Lieutenant on probation, and served with the infantry in Cyprus, Malaysia, Northern Ireland and Germany. He was confirmed as a Second Lieutenant in 1970, promoted to Lieutenant on 11 February 1971, and promoted to Captain on 11 August 1975, and acting Major on 1 September 1979..

He transferred to the 13th/18th Royal Hussars (Queen Mary&#x27;s Own) on 28 October 1980, and was promoted to substantive Major on 30 September 1981. He served in Whitehall, Norway, Cyprus and again in Germany. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel on 31 December 1988 (with seniority from 30 June 1988), commanding his Regiment from 1988 to 1991. He was promoted to acting Colonel on 1 December 1992, and to substantive rank on 30 June 1993 and then to Brigadier on 1 September 1999.

His last Army appointment was as Military Attaché at the British Embassy, Rome. He retired from active service on 16 March 2004.

==&quot;Matthew Hervey&quot; series==

Beginning as a Cornet at Waterloo, Matthew Hervey of the 6th Light Dragoons, and son of the vicar of Horningsham finds himself in many of the colonial military actions thereafter, including Ireland, Canada, India, South Africa, Burma and the Balkans. His climb through the ranks is neither fast nor easy, as the son of a vicar does not have the private means to readily buy promotion. His romantic life is also more turbulent than might be expected of a vicar&#x27;s son. Despite his personal trials he makes a very human effort to remain a man of honor, and the adversities he faces change him perceptibly as a character throughout the series. As the impressionable cornet is tried and tested his touchstone remains his fellow dragoons, to several of whom he becomes very close.

The series is highly detailed with regard to the daily operations of a cavalry regiment, campaigning and at barracks. Matthew Hervey&#x27;s social life also demonstrates for the reader many of the customs and proprieties of English society in the early to mid 1800s. Also of note, unlike many books of either fiction or non-fiction, equestrian details related to tack, training, riding and equestrian health are specific and frequent. Much like the Patrick O&#x27;Brian character Stephen Maturin&#x27;s medical practice, the various troop veterinary surgeons of the 6th Light Dragoons are often consulted and they give the reader some interesting insight into the evolution of veterinary practice. Matthew Hervey&#x27;s familiarity with the subject contributes greatly to the sensation of being transported to the life of a cavalryman.

* &quot;Light Dragoons&quot; (1993) – a non-fictional history of the four light cavalry regiments of the British Army. It was published in 1993, soon after he relinquished command of 13th/18th Royal Hussars (which includes (in merged form) two of the light dragoon regiments: the 13th was originally raised as a heavy dragoon regiment in 1715 but later converted to light dragoons; the 18th was raised as a light dragoon regiment in 1759; both retitled as hussars in 1861, merged in 1922 and then merged with the 15th/19th The King&#x27;s Royal Hussars to form the present Light Dragoons in 1992).
* &quot;The Making of the British Army: From the English Civil War to the War On Terror&quot; (2009). The book examines nearly 500 years of the British Army and examines how its military actions has made it one of the most effective fighting forces in the world today. Mallinson demonstrates how people and events have shaped the army&#x27;s development. Sections include: how Marlborough&#x27;s victory at Blenheim is linked to Wellington&#x27;s success at Waterloo; how the desperate fight at Rorke&#x27;s Drift in 1879 underpinned the heroism of the airborne forces in Arnhem in 1944; and why Montgomery&#x27;s momentous victory at El Alamein mattered long after the Second World War.
* &quot;1914: Fight the Good Fight: Britain, the Army and the Coming of the First World War&quot; (2013) - In this major new history, one of Britain&#x27;s foremost military historians and defence experts tackles the origins - and the opening first few weeks of fighting - of what would become known as &#x27;the war to end all wars&#x27;. Intensely researched and convincingly argued, Allan Mallinson explores and explains the grand strategic shift that occurred in the century before the war, the British Army&#x27;s regeneration after its drubbings in its fight against the Boer in South Africa, its almost calamitous experience of the first twenty days&#x27; fighting in Flanders to the point at which the British Expeditionary Force - the &#x27;Old Contemptibles&#x27; - took up the pick and the spade in the middle of September 1914. For it was then that the war changed from one of rapid and brutal movement into the now familiar image of the trenches and the coming of the Territorials, Kitchener&#x27;s &#x27;Pals&#x27;, and ultimately the conscripts - and of course the poets. And with them, that terrible sense of the pity and of the futility.
* &quot;Too Important for the Generals: Winning and Losing the First World War&quot; (2017). In this work Mallinson argues that recent defences of Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig and other are mistaken - and that critics of the strategy and tactics of the First World War (such as Winston Churchill) were actually correct, but that the critics lacked the power to put their ideas into practice. For example, Winston Churchill could suggest alternative approaches - but he did not have the power to pick what commanders would carry out his ideas.

<text>Tembec Industries Inc., known as Tembec, was a paper company in Canada, founded by Frank Dottori. In 2011, Tembec had approximately 3000 employees, with locations in Canada, United States, and France. Tembec&#x27;s operating divisions included Forest Products, Pulp, Paper &amp; Paperboard, and Chemicals.

==History==
Tembec was founded in 1973 by Frank Dottori in the town of Témiscaming, Quebec, following efforts by former employees and Temiscaming residents to save their jobs and save their town&#x27;s economy. They organized to create a company through an unprecedented relationship among entrepreneurs, unionized employees, the community and several levels of government. In 1973, the newly-founded company purchased the shuttered mill and Tembec was founded. A documentary covering the efforts of workers to form Tembec and reopen the mill, &quot;Témiskaming, Quebec&quot;, was created by Martin Duckworth and released by the National Film Board in 1975.

In May 2017, it was announced that Tembec had agreed to a takeover offer by Rayonier Advanced Materials for CAD $320 million. In July, Rayonier&#x27;s offer was raised to CAD $475 million. The deal closed in November.

On 8 January 2020, the company was fined $250,000 for the 25 May 2018 death of a worker in Chapleau, to which it had pled guilty. The accident had occurred six days prior to when, according to court proceedings, &quot;Rayonier acquired the mill from Tembec Industries Inc., which operated the mill under the name Ryam Lumber, on May 31, 2018.&quot;

==Operations==
Tembec&#x27;s Forest Products Group comprised 31 manufacturing operations producing softwood lumber, engineered wood products, and specialty wood products. The Pulp, Paper &amp; Paperboard Group consisted of 9 pulp manufacturing plants, 5 paper manufacturing plants and 1 paperboard plant. The Chemicals group produced resins, ethanol lignin from the pulping discharge in five of its pulping plants.

==In popular culture==
The town gained national attention and its efforts to save itself were chronicled in the documentary, &quot;A Town that Wouldn’t Die.&quot;

<text>Jerome Wurf (May 18, 1919 – December 10, 1981) was a U.S. labor leader and president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) from 1964 to 1981. Wurf was a friend of Martin Luther King Jr., and was arrested multiple times for his activism, notably during the Memphis sanitation strike. He was present for King&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Been to the Mountaintop&quot; oratory at the strike, the day before King was assassinated, and attended King&#x27;s funeral.

==Background==
Wurf was born in New York City in 1919. The son of Jewish immigrants (his father was a tailor and textile worker) from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, he developed polio at the age of four. As a young man growing up in Brighton Beach, he was inclined towards radicalism by his family&#x27;s poverty and by communists he met. For some time he joined the Young Communist League; he subsequently left it for the Young People&#x27;s Socialist League. He was a critical of both groups, but preferred the YPSL due to his dislike of Soviet totalitarianism.

==HERE==
He enrolled at New York University but dropped out to pursue radical organizing. He got his start in the labor movement by working cafeterias and organizing the workers, forming Local 448, Food and Cashiers Local of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE), in 1943. Local 448 was becoming powerful when HERE leadership incorporated it into Local 325 (Cooks, Countermen, Subdispensers, Cashiers and Assistants), then fired Wurf. Wurf believed that hostile union leaders caused him to be systematically denied work in the following years.

==AFSCME District Council 37==
AFSCME president Arnold Zander hired Wurf to the union in 1947, after it became clear that Wurf was not welcome in HERE. At this point, AFSCME was not very powerful, and Wurf recalled being treated with contempt by other local organizers. He was generally disillusioned by his union&#x27;s apparent capitulation to the anti-communism of the AFL–CIO and to the desires of local politicians.

On the brink of quitting his job in 1952, Wurf was appointed, again by Zander, to the presidency of New York&#x27;s District Council 37. This upset various established local union leaders, who in many cases tried to leave AFSCME for other unions. Nevertheless, District Council 37 achieved some concrete victories for workers under Wurf&#x27;s leadership.

In 1958, Wurf wrung from mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. an executive order giving the city&#x27;s workers the right to form unions, and providing for elections which could establish these unions as exclusive bargaining agents for the workers in various city agencies. (This order was a model for President Kennedy&#x27;s Executive Order 10988, which recognized the right of federal employees to collective bargaining. ) District Council 37 won many of the ensuing elections, making it into one of the large public employee local unions in the world.

Wurf broke with Zander over his allegiances to the AFL–CIO and to the Mafia. He also questioned Zander&#x27;s growing authority over individual Locals through trusteeships. After the union&#x27;s 1958 convention, he decided to seek its presidency.

==Election campaign==
Wurf and others unhappy with Zander&#x27;s leadership formed COUR, the Committee on Union Responsibility, as an opposition party. The organization gained popularity, and received a number of votes in 1962 even though hundreds of &quot;international&quot; delegates were directly controlled by Zander. Zander also benefited from rules limiting any one Local&#x27;s representation to five delegates (with one delegate per hundred members), rules which substantially decreased the power of larger urban Locals. Wurf himself did not campaign actively in 1962, although he did receive a nomination for president. Even so, the final vote was close (1490 to 1085). Zander, surprised by the result, subsequently lost face at the convention during unsuccessful efforts to increase union taxes on the Locals.

Over the next two years, Zander tried to expel Wurf and other members of COUR from the union. This proved difficult due to their popular support. Zander and his supporters also published negative stories about Wurf in the union&#x27;s newspaper, denying COUR access to the mailing list for its distribution.

In 1964, Wurf unseated Zander by just 21 votes, despite Zander&#x27;s active use of his incumbent position to control the election procedurally. According to the &quot;Milwaukee Sentinel&quot;: &quot;Zander&#x27;s supporters attempted to prevent Wurf&#x27;s backers from reading results of the election into the convention records. The struggle from the floor, with Zander guiding the fight from the podium continued into the afternoon session.&quot; COUR won ten out of eleven seats on the executive board. After the announcement of his narrow victory, Wurf surrounded himself with bodyguards and sent three people to the union office in Washington to change the locks. He also moved to designate Zander &#x27;president emeritus&#x27; and provide him with a full salary and expenses until retirement age.

Wurf became the first challenger to defeat a president of a major AFL-CIO international union since Walter Reuther had done so in 1946.

===Arrival in Washington===
When Wurf arrived at AFSCME offices at 815 Mount Vernon Place in Washington, they were trashed inside and outside. One floor of the building had been leased to a pizza bakery. After examining the account books, Wurf also realized that AFSCME was hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. Wurf sold the building and moved the union to a smaller office.

Also soon after arriving, Wurf discovered and ended an ongoing CIA program within AFSCME. This program funneled around a million dollars to British Guiana between 1957 and 1964 for the purpose of supporting Forbes Burnham over Cheddi Jagan.

===Constitutional convention===
In 1965, Wurf called a constitutional convention for AFSCME in Washington. The convention passed amendments that increased representation from large Locals (allowing them more than five delegates, though only one for every additional thousand), decreased the central office&#x27;s ability to control Locals through trusteeships, and required that union vice presidents be elected locally and not paid members of the &quot;international&quot; office. The convention did increase the powers of the union president, authorizing him or her to &quot;employ, terminate, fix the compensation and expenses, and direct the activities of such office staff, administrative assistants, technical and professional assistants, field staff, organizers, and representatives as are required to carry out effectively the functions of his office.&quot;

==Presidency==
Wurf&#x27;s election in 1964 began an area of growth and racial inclusion for the union.

Through energetic organizing and aggressive bargaining, AFSCME grew rapidly under his leadership from about 220,000 members to just over one million in 1981.

Wurf presided over strikes in New York (1965), Lansing (1966), Memphis (1968), Baltimore (1974) and more.

Wurf was a frequent dissenter to the policies of the AFL-CIO and its president George Meany.

==Civil rights movement==
Wurf was extremely active in the civil rights movement. He helped establish the first New York State chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) in the late 1940s. He was a close associate of Martin Luther King Jr., who was working in support of the Memphis sanitation strike when he was assassinated in April 1968. &quot;Let us never forget that Martin Luther King, on a mission for us, was killed in this city. He helped bring us this victory,&quot; Wurf later said. Although Wurf did not back the strike initially, due to the violent atmosphere, he supported it after it went into effect.

==After AFSCME presidency==

Wurf died of a heart attack at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C., on December 10, 1981. Gerald McEntee succeeded him as president of AFSCME.

Wurf&#x27;s legacy as AFSCME President is documented in the AFSCME Archives at the Walter P. Reuther Library in Detroit as the AFSCME Office of the President: Jerry Wurf Records, 1959–1981, as well as many other AFSCME departmental collections.

<text>, or Konkō, is a Shinto sect, with origins in Shinbutsu-shūgō beliefs. It is part of the . 

Konkōkyō believers worship the spirit and energy that flows through all things (&quot;musubi&quot;, one of the core beliefs of Shinto) as &quot;Tenchi Kane No Kami&quot; , or the Golden Kami of the Heavens and Earth (in Japanese, &quot;Heavens and Earth&quot; also means the Universe). 

While Konkōkyō is hard to define with any one particular theology, Tenchi Kane no Kami is understood to be omnipresent and is essentially the energy that penetrates (and/or manifests) the universe and gives all things a consciousness; a non-omnipotent director of the workings of nature. The physical universe is referred to as &quot;Kami’s body&quot; within Konko texts. 

In Konkōkyō theology, the relationship between Kami and humanity is a benevolent and interdependent one. Kami is often seen as a divine ideal parent - offering love, affection, support, protection, and nurturing us through his blessings. Konkōkyō teaches that Kami loves all people of the world no matter their race, religion, gender, etc. Although mentioned as &#x27;He&#x27; in materials for linguistic convenience, Tenchi Kane no Kami is neither male or female.

The sole interest of Tenchi Kane no Kami is the happiness of individual humans. Konkōkyō&#x27;s ideal is the alleviation of human suffering through two means; firstly, realizing all occurrences and parts of human life are gifts of Kami and part of the natural order and maintenance of the universe, and secondly, realizing the identity of the self and the universe as undying and part of Tenchi Kane No Kami. Humans are to serve their role in the universe with inner peace, and bring joy to themselves through healthy and natural indulgence. 

Tenchi Kane No Kami is also referred to as &quot;Tenchi No Kami-Sama&quot;, &quot;Oyagami-Sama,&quot; &quot;Kami-Sama,&quot; and &quot;Kami.&quot; In English, Kami can also be called &quot;Divine Parent of the Universe,&quot; &quot;Principle Parent,&quot; &quot;Parent Kami,&quot; &quot;Kami-Sama,&quot; or &quot;Kami.&quot;

==Founder==
 is recognized as the founder of Konkōkyō, beginning in 1859. He was born on September 29, 1814, in the village of Urami in Bitchū Province (in present-day Asakuchi, Okayama Prefecture) to a farming family. Urami was a small quiet village located about two kilometers northwest of present-day Konkōkyō Headquarters. Genshichi was often carried on his father&#x27;s back and visited various shrines and temples. Given the name Genshichi, he was the second son of Kandori Juhei (Father) and Kandori Shimo (Mother). When Bunji was 13, he received education from Ono Mitsuemon, the village headman for two years.

As Genshichi was the second son and thus not expected to take over the family lineage or farm, he was arranged to be adopted in the fall of 1825. At age twelve, Genshichi was adopted into the Kawate household by Kawate Kumejiro (Father) and Kawate Iwa (Mother), and he was renamed Kawate Bunjiro, or Bunji. He worked assiduously for the prosperity and welfare of his family, and he gained the respect of those around him.

In 1855, at the age of forty-two, Bunjirō went to the important shrine of Okayama Prefecture Kibitsu Jinja to do a divination and prayer ceremony as it was his &quot;yakudoshi&quot; (unlucky age year). He believed he had received a good omen, yet that year suffered from a serious throat ailment, rendering him in a chronic condition and unable to speak or move. He could not receive help from doctors, so he turned to ancient Shinto ritual with the help of his brother in law, Furukawa Jiro, to find the reason of his illness. The deity of Ishizuchi revealed through an oracle that Bunjirō was supposed to die from his illness for offending the deity Konjin. Realizing his mistakes, Bunjirō wanted to apologize to the deity. By this sincere desire to do so, he was able to gain his voice back, and was able to apologize to the deity with his own voice. From that time, he then gradually recovered from his illness completely, the experience impacting his faith and beliefs.

As he continued his faith practice from that day, more spiritual experiences occurred, and his faith grew in the Kami and Bodhisattvas. In particular, he prayed most often to Konjin due to the spiritual experience during his yakudoshi year and apologizing for his irreverence to this deity. Over time, his faith led him to pray to multiple kami at once as a composite deity. He understood this composite deity as Nittenshi (The Buddhist understanding of the Sun) Gattenshi (The Buddhist understanding of the Moon), and Kane no Kami (Nigimitama of Ushitora no Konjin). Ultimately, however, this deity revealed themselves through an oracle that they were not a composite deity, but the deity that was the spirit/soul that was the Universal workings and energy (not unlike the Hindu concept of Brahman), to which Bunjirō understood the name to be Tenchi Kane no Kami.

Thus, Bunjirō practiced his faith in this deity, Tenchi Kane no Kami, who revealed to him many teachings through spiritual experiences. On November 15, 1859 (The date understood as the founding date of the Konkōkyō way) Tenchi Kane no Kami asked Bunjirō to give up his farming career, and help people by listening to them and praying for their troubles or requests, and become a priest. In a response, Bunjirō gave up farming and devoted himself to helping others.

He taught others who came to his worship space that Tenchi Kane no Kami &quot;Wishes to help and save people. But can do so only through other people. By helping people, one performs the work of this deity. This deity depends on people, and at the same time, people depend on this deity, in mutual fulfillment.&quot;

Before long, the number of visitors seeking advice and spiritual guidance grew, and as well a group of disciples called the &quot;deyashiro&quot; was formed to help Bunjirō spread the teachings of this deity.

After the Meiji Restoration of 1868, religious policies of the new government temporarily placed limits on Konkōkyō teachings, due to Tenchi Kane no Kami not being a formal deity of the Kojiki (the only deities allowed worship and shrines in the Meiji era), however, this provided an opportunity to develop important aspects that ended up preserving Konkōkyo&#x27;s history and teachings, such as the memoir &quot;Konkō Daijin Oboegaki,&quot; written by Bunjirō documenting his spiritual experiences and daily living with his faith in Tenchi Kane no Kami. In his later years, he compiled the &quot;Oshirase-goto oboechō&quot; (Record of Revelations) which documented the spiritual experiences clearly. On October 10, 1883, Bunjirō passed away at the age of seventy.

He was succeeded by his son, Konko Ieyoshi, who became regarded as the successor and spiritual leader to pass on the Konkōkyō way of helping others, who was supported by the disciples of Bunjirō.

Subsequently, the Konko family line has retained their leadership roles and have been responsible for spiritually guiding the followers of Konkōkyō - the teachings of Tenchi Kane no Kami - since Bunjirō&#x27;s passing.

The 6th generation son, Hiromichi Konko, became the spiritual leader of Konkōkyō in 2021.

==Beliefs==

In Konkōkyō, everything is seen as being in profound interrelation with each other. Kami is not seen as distant or residing in heaven, but present within this world. The universe is perceived to be the body of Tenchi Kane no Kami. Suffering is seen as being caused by an individual&#x27;s high expectations, unwillingness to compromise, impatience, arrogance, and disregard between the relationship between all things. Konkōkyō&#x27;s beliefs center around the betterment of human life in this world by showing appreciation for all things, living upright, and providing mutual help, and prayer for others. By embodying these virtues, it is taught anyone can become an &quot;ikigami&quot;, or living kami - one who helps others unconditionally and has inner peace. An ikigami is not an exalted being or someone with mysterious, spiritual powers. It is the ideal human being who strives to save people from suffering and problems and to make the world a happier place to live in. It is believed that after death, the spirits of those who have passed on remain of the universe, as mitama-no-kami (divine ancestral spirits) in connection with Tenchi Kane No Kami.

Bunjirō taught that one could receive the help of Tenchi Kane no Kami by &quot;having faith in the Kami out of a sincere mind&quot; (known in Japanese as the phrase &quot;Jitsui Teinei Shinjin&quot;).

Konkōkyō believes there is a mutually dependent relationship between Tenchi Kane No Kami and people. People cannot exist without Tenchi Kane No Kami, and Tenchi Kane No Kami cannot exist without people. With air, water, food, and other blessings of the universe, all living things can thrive. In return, Tenchi Kane No Kami asks that people help others, live in harmony with the ways of the Universe, and make the world a peaceful place to live for everyone. By fulfilling Tenchi Kane No Kami&#x27;s wishes to help others, people bring Tenchi Kane No Kami&#x27;s virtue to life. Through this mutually reliant and interdependent relationship, both Tenchi Kane No Kami and people can continue to exist and work together to make the world a more peaceful place.

An aspect that separates Konkōkyō as a unique way is &quot;Toritsugi&quot; which means mediation. In Konkōkyō, Toritsugi (Mediation) is a spiritual practice for people to establish a communication link between themselves and Tenchi Kane no Kami. One can receive &quot;Toritsugi&quot; by a Konkōkyō minister, generally at a Konkōkyō church. A visitor enters the church, sits in front of the minister, and says whatever is on their mind. It can be a request to resolve a problem, or a word of thanks.

In &quot;Toritsugi,&quot; after the visitor says everything they have wanted to say, the minister relays the visitor&#x27;s words to the spirit of Ikigami Konko Daijin (the spiritual formal name of Bunjirō, who was first taught &quot;Toritsugi&quot; by Tenchi Kane no Kami) in prayer. Ikigami Konko Daijin then helps the minister to further relay the words to Tenchi Kane No Kami.

Tenchi Kane no Kami then replies their message to the minister, who will then relay it back to the person.

By understanding the message of Tenchi Kane No Kami&#x27;s teachings and advice, the visitor can receive guidance to their issues, or feel relieved from anxieties knowing the deity has heard their words. &quot;Toritsugi&quot; can help the person put a problem into perspective and find solutions from within their own hearts.

Tenchi Kane No Kami asks people to understand their teachings, thus to make people become aware of their relationship with the Universe and the ways of the Universe. By working within the framework of the laws of the Universe instead of going against it, people can avoid troubles which lead to suffering. While &quot;Toritsugi&quot; at churches is typically performed by ministers, lay members are also encouraged to perform &quot;Toritsugi&quot; in their daily lives to help others. When they meet people who are suffering, the Konkōkyō way is to listen to their problems, support them, and pray for their wellbeing and happiness. Tenchi Kane no Kami wishes for all people to become a mediator and help others.

Konkōkyō has churches where people can go to worship and pray. Though Konkōkyō believes that Tenchi Kane No Kami is everywhere, and followers of the way can talk to the deity anytime and anywhere, the church is a place to receive assistance and guidance through &quot;Toritsugi,&quot; and for people to focus their prayers, to appreciate blessings, apologize for any irreverences they may feel they have made, as well as be a safe and calming center for people to visit.

The faith believes that all people came from and are connected by the universe. This means that all people are connected by Tenchi Kane no Kami and there is no one that does not belong. Konkōkyō desires to have all people, regardless of race, creed, gender, and occupation, work together to resolve the problems of the world. The faith also respects and accepts all ethnic groups and religions.

All people are regarded as equal regardless of race, religion, gender, occupation, social status, and wealth. Women in Konkōkyō are also held in high esteem with many women serving as head ministers at its churches.

Konkōkyō also does not impose any restrictions on food and drink. Konkōkyō believers are permitted to consume alcohol, caffeine, meat, etc.

Celibacy is also not a requirement for the clergy or anyone. There are no restrictions for Konkōkyō believers. Additionally, believers are not obligated or required to pay any dues or make any donations.

Defining Konkōkyō&#x27;s theology in western terminology is complex, but panentheism, pantheism, non-dualism, animism, monotheism, and henotheism can be, and have been, used to describe the faith depending on one&#x27; definition of those terms.

==Membership==
The following information is current as of December 1, 2012 (Kondō, 2013, p. 39).
* Churches (教会): 1,550
* Missions (布教所): 10
* Ministers (教師): 3,909
* Ministerʻs assistants/Deacons (補教): 1,855

There are about 450,000 adherents.

Konkōkyō churches and missions are found in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Germany, Paraguay, and South Korea, and majorly Japan. Due to the Japanese cultural nature of Konkōkyō, it has limited churches overseas.

Through its various churches and missions, Konkōkyō has a number of activities and organizations that help fulfill the necessities of modern-day society: Konkōkyō Peace Activity Center, Konkō Library, Konkō Church of Izuo Miyake Homes (India, Bangladesh, and Nepal), Yatsunami Foundation, Shinkō-kai Medical Foundation, Konkō Academy, Wakaba Orphanage, and Katsuragi Memorial Park (cemetery) (Takahashi, 1994).

==Relationship to Shintō==

Because of Japanese society being deeply intertwined with Shinbutsu shūgō at the time of Bunjirō, the founder, Konkōkyō is deeply rooted in Shinto ways, traditions, and rituals - many of which still are present in the ceremonies in the present day.

Due to the Meiji Restoration&#x27;s new laws on Shinto practices, Konkōkyō was classified as a sect of Shintō. This allowed Konkōkyō to continue practicing as a spiritual way without persecution from the government.

Konkōkyō has never renounced this classification even after it was free to do so at the end of World War II, alongside the abolition of State Shinto and organization turning into shrine-based or Shrine (Jinja) Shinto.

As of January 2020, Konkōkyō maintains membership in the .

The philosophy, practices, and beliefs of Konkōkyō are aligned very similar to Shrine Shinto; since they both are Shinto practices. Therefore, there are many Konkō followers who also consider themselves Shinja (Followers of Shinto).

However, since Konkōkyō is not dogmatic; interpretations and understandings in regard to connection to Shinto varies between individuals and regions. However historically and within its nature, as well as rituals and ceremonies, Konkōkyō is deeply connected to Shinto practices.

Since Jinja Shinto is the more common organization of Shinto way in Japan, it is thought that Konkōkyō is different than Shinto. But it is more accurate to say it only differs from Jinja Shinto, but is still Shinto. The only few main differences between Jinja Shinto and Konkōkyō are:

*Toritsugi Mediation, which is a practice unique to Konkōkyō.

*Not offering items commonly seen in Jinja Shinto shrines; such as ofuda or omamori, due to the teaching from Tenchi Kane no Kami that Konkōkyō churches shouldn&#x27;t be a place that people feel pressured to donate to receive protection from omamori, or need to donate for an ofuda to call to the power of Tenchi Kane no Kami. In addition, if one has the financial ability and wishes to receive the items, it is taught that it is good to support the other kamis and Buddha&#x27;s shrines or temples instead. This is also why Konkōkyō does not have set ritual fees, nor requires donations from visitors or parishioners.

*Konkōkyō has also centralized the Tenchi Kakitsuke [Universal Reminder] as its main focus on the altar and in prayers. Some churches only have a Tenchi Kakitsuke, while others have additional traditional items seen in Shinto shrines, such as sacred mirrors, or gohei, to indicate the presence of the deity.

*Another difference is, while some Konkōkyō followers are able to and may revere other Kami, such as Amaterasu, who is the required most revered deity in Jinja Shinto teachings, Konkōkyō places a focus on Tenchi Kane no Kami, and to have an equal respect for all deities, not placing importance on one kami or the other; since they are all part of the universe and should all be equally respected.

*The faith also differs in that it does not believe in taboos including beliefs related to unlucky days, unlucky years (age), and ominous directions. There are no distinctions between pure and impure things or sacred and non-sacred places. There is the concept of places where there is more amount of spiritual power, but the amount of spiritual power is not seen as determining its sacredness, as all is within the universe/nature which is seen as sacred in itself.

*It should also be noted that some churches, especially overseas, have been making modern changes to worship style that are different than traditional Shintō style to be more welcoming to those unfamiliar with Japanese culture.

*New Konkōkyō-unique prayers were also written in 1985 from the original traditional Shintō prayers — Amatsu Norito and Ōharae no Kotoba— to Shinzen Haishi [Prayer to Kami], Reizen Haishi [Prayer to Ancestral spirits]. Despite this, some churches overseas and in Japan, keep traditional Shinto ritual, worship, and prayers. It varies greatly from church to church, and a minister by minister basis.

<text>State Route 80 (SR 80) is a long, roughly arc-shaped highway lying in southeastern Arizona. Starting in downtown Benson, the highway serves as the main route through the towns of St. David, Tombstone, Bisbee and Douglas before terminating at the New Mexico state line, becoming New Mexico State Road 80 (NM 80). SR 80 also acts as the national southern terminus of US 191 near Douglas and provides the only connection between the U.S. Highway and its business route in Douglas.

Both SR 80 and NM 80 were once part of U.S. Route 80, which traveled through Arizona between San Diego, California and Savannah, Georgia, starting in 1926. The US 80 designation was retired from this route in 1989 after being made redundant by Interstate 10. Despite being replaced by the Interstate, this segment of old US 80 was not closely paralleled by or reconstructed into I-10, as the Interstate was constructed further north and instead supplants the shorter former route of SR 86 and NM 14.

==Route description==
State Route 80 (SR 80) begins at an intersection with I-10 Business (4th Street) in Benson near an Amtrak station. The route heads south until it exits the city limit of Benson, where it turns slightly southeast, parallelling the San Pedro River through the southern extent of the San Pedro Valley. At the intersection with Apache Powder Road, SR 80 turns eastward, crossing over the San Pedro River and entering St. David as Patton Street. In St. David, SR 80 turns south as Lee Street. South of St. David, SR 80 continues to parallel the San Pedro River until the highway steers southeast, where the river continues due south. from Just north of Tombstone, SR 80 intersects the eastern terminus of SR 82. While SR 82 heads west towards Nogales, SR 80 continues southeast, before entering Tombstone.
In Tombstone, SR 80 becomes Sumner Street, before curving southeast on Fremont Street through town, past the infamous O.K. Corral. Continuing southeast out of Tombstone, SR 80 curves south just before passing the Tombstone Municipal Airport. The road intersects the eastern terminus of SR 90, which heads west towards Fort Huachuca and Sierra Vista. Past the SR 90 junction, SR 80 proceeds south through the Mule Mountains, where the highway passes through the Mule Pass Tunnel, entering the Bisbee city limits, then skirts around the southern edge of downtown Bisbee. Downtown Bisbee is accessible from SR 80 via two grade-separated interchanges at Tombstone Canyon Road and Main Street. After passing both the inactive Copper Queen Mine and the Lavender Pit, the road meets the eastern terminus of SR 92 at a traffic circle. SR 92 heads southwest towards Sierra Vista, while SR 80 continues east of the traffic circle, past the Warren district of Bisbee. The highway turns southeast at the intersection with Double Adobe Road.
Southeast of Bisbee, SR 80 approaches the international boundary with Mexico as it nears Douglas. Immediately west of town, SR 80 intersects with the southern terminus of U.S. Route 191, directly north of the old smelter site. Entering town, SR 80 becomes 16th Street, which becomes G Avenue shortly before arriving at an intersection with Pan American Avenue, directly in front of the old railroad station, which currently houses the Douglas Police Department. South of this intersection, Pan American Avenue is designated US 191 Business, which serves the Raul H. Castro Port of Entry between Douglas and Agua Prieta. As US 191 Business does not intersect its parent route, US 191, both routes rely on SR 80 as a direct connection.

SR 80 turns north on Pan American Avenue away from US 191 Business. After a short distance, the route takes a more northeasterly route away from the international boundary, paralleling the abandoned trackbed of the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad. SR 80 heads through the San Bernardino Valley, passing through the small hamlet of Apache, where the Geronimo Surrender Monument is located. Northeast of Apache, the highway crosses the appropriately named State Line Road at the New Mexico state line and becomes New Mexico State Road 80 (NM 80). NM 80 continues through Rodeo towards Interstate 10.

==History==
State Route 80 (SR 80) was originally conceived as part of the proposed state highway system in 1919. On November 11, 1926, it became part of the transcontinental highway U.S. Route 80, which ran between San Diego, California and Savannah, Georgia. The road was paved at this time between Douglas and Bisbee as well as a portion south of Tombstone. The remainder of the highway was a gravel road. By 1931, the highway was paved from Bisbee to the New Mexico state line as well as a portion south of Benson and another portion south of Tombstone. By 1934, the only portion of the highway yet to be paved was a section between Tombstone and Bisbee. The entire route had been paved by 1935.

By 1964, most of the US 80 nationwide was being largely replaced or made redundant by Interstate 8, Interstate 10 and Interstate 20. On July 1, 1964, California decommissioned its entire segment of US 80 between San Diego and Yuma. The state of Arizona followed suit in 1977, decommissioning all of US 80 west of I-10 in Benson. This made Benson the western terminus of US 80. Between Benson and Rodeo, New Mexico, I-10 did not directly replace US 80, as the new interstate was constructed over the heavier traveled and shorter route of former Arizona State Route 86 and New Mexico State Road 14. US 80 remained designated east of Benson until 1989, when US 80 was truncated to the Texas state line in Anthony, New Mexico, removing the designation entirely from within the state of Arizona. All of former US 80 between Fourth Street in Benson and the New Mexico state line was redesignated as SR 80. The remainder of former US 80 between SR 80 and I-10 along Fourth Street is now designated as part of I-10 Business.

On September 21, 2018, most of SR 80 was designated as the Benson to New Mexico segment of Historic U.S. Route 80. The designation was further applied to parts of Allen Street and 6th Street in Tombstone along with Old Divide Road/Tombstone Canyon Road as well as Main Street in Bisbee and G Avenue, 10th Street and A Avenue in Douglas. These other roads were also designated as part of US 80 in previous years, but were bypassed before SR 80 was designated. The I-10 Business Loop in Benson was also designated as part of the Historic Route, as the loop between I-10 and SR 80 was part of US 80 before 1989.

<doc id="750381" wikidata="Q6045958" url="?curid=750381" title="Powdery mildew">
<text>Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants. Powdery mildew diseases are caused by many different species of ascomycete fungi in the order Erysiphales. Powdery mildew is one of the easier plant diseases to identify, as the signs of the causal pathogen are quite distinctive. Infected plants display white powdery spots on the leaves and stems. This mycelial layer may quickly spread to cover all of the leaves. The lower leaves are the most affected, but the mildew can appear on any above-ground part of the plant. As the disease progresses, the spots get larger and denser as large numbers of asexual spores are formed, and the mildew may spread up and down the length of the plant.

Powdery mildew grows well in environments with high humidity and moderate temperatures; greenhouses provide an ideal moist, temperate environment for the spread of the disease. This causes harm to agricultural and horticultural practices where powdery mildew may thrive in a greenhouse setting. In an agricultural or horticultural setting, the pathogen can be controlled using chemical methods, bio-organic methods, and genetic resistance. It is important to be aware of powdery mildew and its management strategies as the resulting disease can significantly reduce important crop yields.


== Reproduction ==

Powdery mildew fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually. Sexual reproduction occurs via chasmothecia (formerly cleistothecium), a type of ascocarp in which genetic recombination takes place. Ascocarps including chasmothecia, apothecia, perithecia, and pseudothecia, are the fruiting bodies unique to fungi in the Ascomycota phylum (known as ascomycetes). Within each ascocarp are several asci that contain ascospores. Powdery mildew fungi must be adapted to their host for successful infection.

Under optimal conditions, ascospores mature and are released to initiate new infections. Conditions necessary for spore maturation differ among species. In asexual reproduction, the mother fungi and offspring are genetically identical. Asexual reproduction is the predominant form of reproduction and dispersal in powdery mildew infections of wheat and barley species, as compared to sexual reproduction. Yet sexual reproduction results in durable and resistant overwintering spores, produced in chasmothecia. These spores are dark (to protect against UV irradiation), round and thick-walled (to protect against freezing rupture), giving them the ability to survive throughout the winter. They will germinate in the spring for new infection.

=== DNA repair ===

DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is an enzymatic system for recognizing and repairing erroneous base insertions, deletions, and mis-incorporations in DNA that can arise during DNA replication and recombination. This system can also repair some forms of DNA damage. Four closely related species of plant parasites from the powdery mildew genera were found to have lost between 5 and 21 of the 48 to 52 MMR genes that are present in most other ascomycete genomes. The powdery mildew species with higher levels of MMR gene loss exhibited elevated rates of various types of mutation. These elevated mutation rates suggest that a lack of genes essential for accurate DNA replication can cause an increased rate of sequence evolution and evolutionary diversification.

== Management==

In an agricultural setting, the pathogen can be controlled using chemical methods, genetic resistance, and careful farming methods. Some cultivated plants have varieties resistant to powdery mildew.

Powdery mildew growth can be limited by reducing humidity, such as by allowing space between plants for airflow, and pruning to thin foliage.

=== Conventional chemical control ===

Standard fungicides are an effective way to manage powdery mildew disease on plants. Spray programs of conventional fungicides are advised to begin when powdery mildew symptoms and signs are first noticed. Conventional fungicides should be applied on a regular basis for best results against the disease.

Control is possible with triadimefon and propiconazole. It is also possible with hexaconazole, myclobutanil, and penconazole.

=== Non-conventional chemical control ===

Some unconventional chemical control methods offer alternative modes of action.
The most effective non-conventional methods of chemical control against powdery mildew are milk, natural sulfur (&gt;), potassium bicarbonate, metal salts, and oils. 

Metal salt fungicides should be applied on a regular basis up until harvest of the host. Sulfur must be applied before the disease has emerged since it prevents fungi spores from germinating. Copper sulfate is an effective fungicide allowed in organic farming, but can cause harm to the host plant. Addition of lime hampers this effect.

Neem oil effectively manages powdery mildew on many plants by interfering with the fungus&#x27; metabolism and terminating spore production. Sulfur and Fish Oil + Sesame Oil is a mixture effective against powdery mildew.

Milk has long been popular with home gardeners and small-scale organic growers as a treatment for powdery mildew. Milk is diluted with water (typically 1:10) and sprayed on susceptible plants at the first sign of infection, or as a preventative measure, with repeated weekly application often controlling or eliminating the disease. Studies have shown milk&#x27;s effectiveness as comparable to some conventional fungicides, and better than benomyl and fenarimol at higher concentrations. Milk has proven effective in treating powdery mildew of summer squash, pumpkins, grapes, and roses. The exact mechanism of action is unknown, but one known effect is that ferroglobulin, a protein in whey, produces oxygen radicals when exposed to sunlight, and contact with these radicals is damaging to the fungus.

Dilute sprays containing sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and vegetable or mineral oils in water are often recommended for controlling powdery mildew, but such mixtures have limited and inconsistent efficacy. While sodium bicarbonate has been shown to reduce to growth of mildews in lab tests, sprays containing only baking soda and water are not effective in controlling fungal diseases on infected plants, and high concentrations of sodium are harmful to plants.

Potassium bicarbonate is an effective low-toxicity fungicide against powdery mildew and apple scab.

Another non-conventional chemical treatment involves treating with a solution of calcium silicate. Silicon helps the plant cells defend against fungal attack by degrading haustoria and by producing callose and papilla. With silicon treatment, epidermal cells of wheat are less susceptible to powdery mildew.

=== Genetic resistance ===

The Pm3 allele is an effective genetic resistance strategy that protects host species against powdery mildew fungus.

In 2014, resistance was induced in hexaploid bread wheat to powdery mildew via targeted mutations with the use of CRISPR and TALENS gene-editing technology.

== In specific crops ==

=== Sunflowers ===

Sunflower powdery mildew is a disease caused by the pathogens &quot;Golovinomyces cichoracearum&quot;, &quot;Podosphaera xanthii&quot;, and &quot;Leveillula taurica&quot;. The symptoms caused by &quot;L. taurica&quot; differ from the other pathogen symptoms. Green-yellow spots appear on upper leaf surface.

=== Cereals ===

&quot;Blumeria graminis&quot; f. sp. &quot;tritici&quot;, causes powdery mildew of wheat, whereas f. sp. &quot;hordei&quot; causes powdery mildew of barley.

=== Legumes ===

Legumes, such as soybeans, are affected by &quot;Microsphaera diffusa&quot;.

=== Grapes ===

&quot;Erysiphe necator&quot; (or &quot;Uncinula necator&quot;) causes powdery mildew of grapes.

===Onions===
The fungus causing powdery mildew of onions is &quot;Leveillula taurica&quot; (also known by its anamorph name, &quot;Oidiopsis taurica&quot;). It also infects the artichoke.

=== Apples and pears ===

&quot;Podosphaera leucotricha&quot; causes powdery mildew of apples and pears.

=== Squashes ===

Multiple species of fungus can cause powdery mildew of cucurbits: cucumbers, squashes (including pumpkins), luffas, melons, and watermelons.

&quot;Podosphaera xanthii&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Sphaerotheca fuliginea&quot;) is the most commonly reported cause on cucurbits. &quot;Erysiphe cichoracearum&quot; was formerly reported to be the primary causal organism throughout most of the world.

Since 1925, commercial &quot;Cucumis melo&quot; (cantaloup and muskmelon) production has been engaged in a biological &quot;arms race&quot; against cucurbit powdery mildew (CPM) caused by the fungus &quot;Podosphaera xanthii&quot;, with new cultivars of melons being developed for resistance to successively arising races of the fungus, identified simply as race 1, race 2, etc. (seven in total by 2004), for races found around the world, and race N1 through N4 for some divergent races native to Japan. Various subraces have been identified, and given names such as race 2U.S., race 3.5, and race 4.5. A new race S was discovered in 2003, and a specific melon cultivar (&quot;C. melo&quot; var. &quot;acidulus&quot; &#x27;PI 313970&#x27;) found resistant to it, then used for backcrossing to increase resistance in other cultivars. Such modern selective breeding of plants for phytopathological resistance to particular fungal races involves a great deal of genetic research; this PI 313970 versus race S case involved multi-stage hybridization to propagate a recessive gene, &quot;pm-S&quot; in successive generations, and how this may affect other recessive and codominant genes for resistance to other races of &quot;P. xanthii&quot; &quot;remains to be determined&quot;.

A 2004 literature review regarding powdery mildew races that parasitize various cucurbit plants concluded that &quot;race identification is important for basic research and is especially important for the commercial seed industry, which requires accuracy in declaring the type and level of resistance ... in its products&quot;. However, identifying specific races was seen as having little utility in horticulture for choosing specific cultivars, because of the rapidity with which the local pathogen population can change geographically, seasonally, and by host plant.

At least three other Erysiphaceae fungi can cause powdery mildew in cucurbits: The most frequent, after &quot;P. xanthii&quot;, is &quot;Erysiphe cichoracearum&quot;, the former primary causal organism throughout most of the world. &quot;Podosphaera fusca&quot; is another, sometimes considered synonymous with &quot;P. xanthii&quot;. Cucumbers in greenhouse environments have also been reported to be susceptible to &quot;Leveillula taurica&quot;.

=== Lilacs ===

&quot;Microsphaera syringae&quot; is a fungus that can cause powdery mildew in lilac.

=== Strawberries ===

&quot;Podosphaera aphanis&quot; is the cause of powdery mildew in strawberries and other Rosaceae like &quot;Geum rivale&quot; (the water avens).

=== Tree leaves ===

&quot;Sawadaea tulasnei&quot; is a fungus that causes powdery mildew on tree leaves. This fungus attacks the leaves of the &quot;Acer platanoides&quot; (Norway maple) in North America, Great Britain, and Ireland, &quot;Acer palmatum&quot; (also known as the Japanese maple or smooth Japanese maple).

=== Oregon grape ===

&quot;Erysiphe berberidis&quot; is a fungus that causes powdery mildew on Oregon grape leaves.
=== Arabidopsis ===

&quot;Golovinomyces orontii&quot; causes powdery mildew on &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; (rockcress) leaves.

=== &quot;Cannabis&quot; ===
Caused by several fungi including &quot;Golovinomyces ambrosiae&quot; (syn. &quot;G. spadiceus&quot;) and &quot;Podosphaera macularis&quot;.

== Hyperparasites ==

In the family Sphaeropsidaceae of the Sphaeropsidales fungi, species of the genus &quot;Cicinnobolus&quot; are hyperparasites of powdery mildew.

&quot;Ampelomyces quisqualis&quot; is an anamorphic fungus that is a hyperparasite of powdery mildews. This parasitism reduces growth and may eventually kill the mildew. Research on biological control of powdery mildews (especially in high-value crops such as grapes) has been ongoing since the 1970s, resulting in the development of fungicides which contain &quot;A. quisqualis&quot; as the active ingredient.

<text>Triplicate Girl (Luornu Durgo) is a superhero appearing in DC Comics, primarily as a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes in the 30th and 31st centuries. She has also had the aliases Duo Damsel, Triad, Una, Duplicate Damsel, and Duplicate Girl.

Luornu has appeared in various media outside comics, primarily those featuring the Legion of Super-Heroes. She is voiced by Kari Wahlgren in &quot;Legion of Super Heroes&quot; (2006) and Daisy Lightfoot in &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; (2023).

==Publication history==
Luornu Durgo first appeared in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #276 and was created by producer Jerry Siegel and Jim Mooney.

==Fictional character biography==
===Original continuity===
Luornu Durgo, codenamed Triplicate Girl, first appeared in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #276, written by Jerry Siegel. A native of the planet Cargg, she could split into three identical bodies, as could all Carggites, due to the planet Cargg having three suns. She is the fourth hero to join the Legion of Super-Heroes, and its first non-founding member.

After Computo kills one of her selves, Luornu becomes known as Duo Damsel. She later marries Bouncing Boy and leaves the Legion, with the two becoming instructors at the Legion Academy.

A temporal clone of Luornu known as Triad is introduced during the &quot;Five Year Gap&quot; following the Magic Wars.

===&quot;Zero Hour&quot; reboot===
A new version of Luornu is introduced following &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot;, which reboots the Legion&#x27;s contiunity. This version is an employee of R. J. Brande who was ostracized due to her bodies possessing distinct personalities. Furthermore, she possesses the SW6 version&#x27;s codename of Triad.

===&quot;Threeboot&quot;===
In the &quot;Threeboot&quot; continuity, Luornu is the only inhabitant of Cargg, who does not remember her past and populates the planet with duplicates of herself. When a United Planets craft arrives on Cargg, three of Luornu&#x27;s clones are sent as emissaries. When they return, the other replicates considered them &quot;tainted&quot; for experiencing things outside Cargg and exile them. Subsequently, the three join the Legion as Triplicate Girl.

In &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot;, Luornu takes on the alias Una and is killed battling mutant rats.

===Legion of &quot;3 Worlds&quot;===
In the final issue of the &quot;Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds&quot; series, Luornu returns to assist the Legion in battle with the Legion of Super-Villains, revealing that she has gained the ability to create vast numbers of duplicate bodies, and now goes by the name &quot;Duplicate Damsel&quot;. In subsequent appearances, she uses the name &quot;Duplicate Girl&quot;.

=== DC Rebirth ===
In &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Doctor Manhattan erases Triplicate Girl and the Legion from existence before eventually restoring them. In Brian Michael Bendis&#x27; &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; reboot, the character is reimagined as possessing a pink, yellow, and blue color scheme.

==Powers and abilities==
Triplicate Girl has the ability to split into three identical bodies. When Triplicate Girl merges into one body, she gains the memories and knowledge that her divided selves obtained. Furthermore, she is a master of the martial art of &quot;Tri-Jistu&quot;, using her three bodies to maximize her fighting prowess. 

In the &quot;Threeboot&quot; and New Earth continuities, Triplicate Girl can create an unlimited amount of clones.

As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Luornu is provided a Legion Flight Ring, which allows her to fly and protects her from the vacuum of space and other dangerous environments.

<text>Philip Gordon Wylie (May 12, 1902 – October 25, 1971) was an American writer of works ranging from pulp science fiction, mysteries, social diatribes and satire to ecology and the threat of nuclear holocaust.

==Early life and career==
Born in Beverly, Massachusetts, Wylie was the son of Presbyterian minister Edmund Melville Wylie and Edna Edwards, a novelist, who died when Philip was five years old. His family later moved to Montclair, New Jersey.

Wylie attended Princeton University from 1920 to 1923.

A writer of fiction and nonfiction, Wylie&#x27;s output included hundreds of articles, novels, serials, short stories, syndicated newspaper columns, and works of social criticism. He also wrote screenplays while in Hollywood, was an editor for Farrar &amp; Rinehart, served on the Dade County, Florida Defense Council, was a director of the Lerner Marine Laboratory, and at one time was an adviser to the chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee for Atomic Energy, which led to the creation of the Atomic Energy Commission. Most of Wylie&#x27;s major writings contain critical, though often philosophical, views on man and society as a result of his studies and interests in biology, ethnology, physics and psychology.

Sixteen films were made based on screenplays, novels, or stories written by Wylie. He sold the rights for two others that were never produced.

Wylie&#x27;s wide range of interests defies easy classification, but his earliest work exercised great influence in 20th-century science fiction pulp magazines and comic books:
* &quot;Gladiator&quot; (1930) may have partially inspired the comic-book character Superman.
* &quot;The Savage Gentleman&quot; (1932) &quot;Pulp historians point out that the themes of &quot;The Savage Gentleman&quot; are replicated to an uncanny degree in the pulp character Clark &quot;Doc&quot; Savage (1933) created by Lester Dent...&quot; - Richard A. Lupoff
* &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; (1933), co-written with Edwin Balmer, inspired Alex Raymond&#x27;s comic strip Flash Gordon and was adapted as an eponymous 1951 film by producer George Pal.

Wylie applied engineering principles and the scientific method quite broadly in his work. His novel &quot;The Disappearance&quot; (1951) is about what happens when everyone suddenly finds that all members of the opposite sex are missing (all the men have to get along without women, and vice versa). The book delves into the double standards between men and women that existed prior the women&#x27;s movement of the 1970s, exploring the nature of the relationship between men and women and the issues of women&#x27;s rights and homosexuality.

During World War II, writing &quot;The Paradise Crater&quot; (1945) resulted in Wylie&#x27;s house arrest by the federal government; in this work, he described a post-WWII 1965 Nazi conspiracy to develop and use uranium-237 bombs, months before the first successful atomic test at Alamogordo – the most highly classified secret of the war. Wylie&#x27;s book of essays, &quot;Generation of Vipers&quot; (1942), was a best-seller during the 1940s and inspired the term &quot;Momism&quot;. Some people have accused &quot;Generation of Vipers&quot; of being misogynistic. &quot;The Disappearance&quot; shows his thinking on the subject is very complex. (His only child, Karen Pryor, is the author of a classic book for breastfeeding mothers, &quot;Nursing Your Baby&quot;, and has commented that her father was far from being a misogynist.) His novel of manners, &quot;Finnley Wren&quot;, was also highly regarded in its time.

In 1945, he wrote a political column for the New York Post.

Wylie wrote 69 &quot;Crunch and Des&quot; stories, most of which appeared in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, about the adventures of Captain Crunch Adams, master of the charter boat &quot;Poseidon&quot;, which was the basis of a brief television series. In 1941, Wylie became vice-president of the International Game Fish Association, and for many years was responsible for writing IGFA rules and reviewing world record claims.

Wylie&#x27;s 1954 novel &quot;Tomorrow!&quot; dealt graphically with the civilian impact of thermonuclear war to make a case for a strong Civil Defense network in the United States, as he told the story of two neighboring cities (one prepared, one unprepared) before and after an attack by missile-armed Soviet bombers. This was adapted on October 17, 1956, by ABC Radio, as a one-hour drama narrated by Orson Welles, produced in cooperation with the Federal Civil Defense Administration.

Wylie was also active in writing detective and mystery novelettes for a variety of magazines. Five of them were collected in 2010 as &quot;Ten Thousand Blunt Instruments and Other Mysteries,&quot; published by Crippen &amp; Landru in its &quot;Lost Classics&quot; series and edited by Bill Pronzini.

An article Wylie wrote in 1951 in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; entitled &quot;Anyone Can Raise Orchids&quot; led to the popularization of this hobby—not just the rich, but gardeners of every economic level began experimenting with orchids.

Wylie&#x27;s final works dealt with the potentially catastrophic effects of pollution and climate change. Notably, Wylie wrote &quot;L.A. 2017&quot;, a 1971 episode of the television series &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;. The series was normally a contemporary drama; however, in this unique science fiction episode, the lead character awakens in a science-fiction dystopia, centered on a psychiatric/fascist government overseeing the underground-sheltered remnants of humanity, the aftermath of an environmental (pollution) catastrophe. The 90-minute episode was directed by Steven Spielberg, and featured Gene Barry, Barry Sullivan, Edmond O&#x27;Brien, Severn Darden and Sharon Farrell. Wylie wrote a near-simultaneous novelization of the story as &quot;Los Angeles: A.D. 2017&quot;.

Wylie&#x27;s final novel, &quot;The End of the Dream&quot;, was published posthumously in 1972 and foresees a dark future where America slides into ecological catastrophe.

Wylie, and now the Philip Wylie estate, is represented by Harold Ober Associates.

==Personal life==
Wylie married Sally Ondek, and had one child, Karen Pryor. After divorcing his first wife, he married Frederica Ballard, who was born and raised in Rushford, New York; they are both buried in Rushford.

Wylie&#x27;s daughter, Karen Pryor, was an author who became the inventor of animal &quot;clicker&quot; training.

Wylie&#x27;s niece Janice Wylie, the daughter of his brother Max Wylie, co-creator of &quot;The Flying Nun&quot;, was murdered, along with her roommate Emily Hoffert, in New York in August 1963, in what became known as the &quot;Career Girls Murders&quot; case.

==Death==
While on vacation, Wylie died from a heart attack on October 25, 1971, in Miami. Some of his papers, writings, and other possessions are in the Department of Rare Books and Special Collections at Princeton University Library.

Wylie&#x27;s setting allows him to investigate the role of homosexuality in situations where no gender alternative exists.

<text>George Wyndham, PC (29 August 1863 – 8 June 1913) was a British Conservative politician, statesman, man of letters, and one of The Souls.

==Background and education==
Wyndham was the elder son of the Honourable Percy Wyndham, third son of George Wyndham, 1st Baron Leconfield, and he was a direct descendant of Sir John Wyndham. He was the brother of Guy Wyndham and Mary Constance Wyndham. His mother was Madeleine Campbell, sixth daughter of Major-General Sir Guy Campbell, 1st Baronet, and Pamela, through whom he was the great-grandson of the Irish Republican leader Lord Edward FitzGerald, whom Wyndham greatly resembled physically. He was educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He joined the Coldstream Guards in March 1883, serving through the Suakin campaign of 1885.

==Political career==
Wyndham started his political career in 1887, when he became private secretary to Arthur Balfour (afterward the Earl of Balfour). In 1889, he was elected unopposed to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for Dover, and held the seat until his death.

Wyndham launched an Imperialist magazine called &quot;The Outlook&quot; in February 1898. This may have been supported financially by Cecil Rhodes, with whom he had a close relationship. Joseph Conrad, who was a contributor, described the publication: 

Also in 1898, Wyndham was appointed Under-Secretary of State for War under Lord Salisbury, which he remained until 1900. He was closely involved in Irish affairs at two points. Having been private secretary to Arthur Balfour during the years around 1890 when Balfour was Chief Secretary for Ireland, Wyndham was himself made Chief Secretary by Salisbury in 1900. He continued in this position after Balfour succeeded as Prime Minister in July 1902, but was taken into the Cabinet, and sworn a member of the Privy Council on 11 August 1902.

Wyndham furthered the 1902 Land Conference and also successfully saw the significant Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903 into law. This change in the law ushered in the most radical change in history in Ireland&#x27;s land ownership. Before it, Ireland&#x27;s land was largely owned by landlords; within years of the Acts, most of the land was owned by their former tenants, who had been supported in their purchases by government subsidies. This could without exaggeration be called the most radical change in Irish life in history.

He brought forward a devolution scheme to deal with the Home Rule question co-ordinated with the Irish Reform Association conceived by his permanent under-secretary Sir Antony MacDonnell (afterwards Baron) and with the approval of the Lord Lieutenant the Earl of Dudley. He resigned, largely as a result of the failure of his devolution scheme, in March 1905. Balfour&#x27;s Unionist government fell in December 1905.

Wyndham was in October 1902 elected by the students of the University of Glasgow to be Lord Rector of the university for three years. He was elected a Member of the Worshipful Company of Musicians in January 1903.

Wyndham was the leader of the &quot;die-hard&quot; opponents in the House of Commons of the Parliament Bill that became the Parliament Act 1911.

==Family==
Wyndham married in 1887 Sibell Mary, Countess Grosvenor, daughter of Richard Lumley, 9th Earl of Scarbrough, and widow (since 1884) of Victor Grosvenor, Earl Grosvenor, son of the 1st Duke of Westminster. She was Wyndham&#x27;s senior by eight years, and her son succeeded as 2nd Duke of Westminster in 1899. Towards the end of his life the couple settled at Clouds House in Wiltshire, designed for his father Percy Wyndham by the Arts and Crafts movement architect, Philip Webb (1886). In 1911 he succeeded his father and had the management of a small landed estate on his hands.

Wyndham died suddenly in June 1913 in Paris, aged 49, of a blood clot. He was survived by his wife and one son.

Lady Grosvenor died in February 1929, aged 73.

There has been speculation over the years that Wyndham was the natural father of Anthony Eden, who was prime minister from 1955 to 1957. Eden&#x27;s mother, Sybil, Lady Eden, was evidently close to Wyndham, to whom Eden bore a striking resemblance.

<text>William Madden Plante (January 14, 1938 – September 28, 2022) was an American journalist and correspondent for CBS News. He joined the network in 1964. Plante was noted for being the network&#x27;s senior White House correspondent for over three decades. 

Plante was posthumously awarded the Dunnigan-Payne Prize for lifetime career achievement on Saturday, April 29, 2023, at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner.

==Early life and education==
Plante was born in Chicago, on January 14, 1938. His father, Regis, was employed as a field engineer for a heating company; his mother, Jane (Madden), worked as a school administrator. Plante attended Loyola Academy in his hometown, graduating in 1955. It was around this time he was employed by a classical music radio station in Evanston, Illinois, his first experience with broadcasting.

Plante studied business and humanities at Loyola University Chicago, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1959. He dropped out of Chicago-Kent College of Law after a friend got him a job as assistant news director at WISN-TV. He was at the station for four years before being awarded a journalism fellowship by CBS to study political science at Columbia University.

==Career==
After completing his studies at Columbia, Plante started working for CBS News in June 1964 as a reporter and assignment editor. He was sent to South Vietnam later that year to report on the Vietnam War, the first of four tours as a correspondent. His final tour in 1975 saw him cover the fall of Phnom Penh and fall of Saigon, which earned his CBS News team the &quot;Best Radio Spot News Reporting from Abroad&quot; award from the Overseas Press Club.

In March 1965, Plante went to Selma, Alabama and was there when state troopers assaulted marchers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in what was later dubbed &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;. He returned later that month to report on the Selma to Montgomery marches and interviewed Martin Luther King Jr. during the event.

Plante was promoted to correspondent the following year and was posted to the network&#x27;s Chicago bureau. He was there for ten years and reported on the 1966 riots in the city, protests at Ohio University, the strike by the United Auto Workers in 1970, and Jimmy Hoffa&#x27;s disappearance five years later. During this time, he also covered events overseas, including the state funeral of Gamal Abdel Nasser and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, which earned him two more Overseas Press Club awards for spot radio news.

Plante moved to CBS&#x27; Washington bureau in December 1976. He was appointed Senior White House Correspondent for CBS ten years later and held that role for 35 years until his retirement in November 2016. He anchored &quot;CBS Sunday Night News&quot; from 1988 to 1995 and also reported for &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; and the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;. Plante won several Emmy Awards – both outright and shared with fellow CBS News correspondents – for his coverage on the Vietnam War air theater (1972), Ronald Reagan&#x27;s re-election in 1984, Reagan&#x27;s summit with Mikhail Gorbachev two years later, and the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales (1997).

Plante was noted for his extensive wine collection. Other members of the press corps considered him to be an expert on the subject and became their unofficial sommelier during his tenure as White House correspondent. He also spoke about the subject from time to time on &quot;The Early Show&quot; and &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot;. 

While covering Bill Clinton&#x27;s visit to New Zealand, Plante bungee jumped over the Kawarau River alongside White House aides. Before jumping, he declared, &quot;This is Bill Plante of CBS News, proving that you&#x27;re never too old to do something foolish&quot;.

Plante was known for his booming baritone voice.

==Personal life==
Plante&#x27;s first marriage was to Barbara Barnes Orteig. Together, they had two children, as well as four sons from her previous marriage whom Plante adopted, including future syndicated radio talk show host Chris Plante. They eventually divorced and he later married Robin Smith in 1987. They remained married for 34 years until his death. One of his sons, Patrick, predeceased him in 2014.

Plante died on September 28, 2022, at his home in Washington, D.C., after suffering from respiratory failure. He was 84.
