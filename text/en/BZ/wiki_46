<text>Separation of powers is a political doctrine originating in the writings of Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu in &quot;The Spirit of the Laws&quot;, in which he argued for a constitutional government with three separate branches, each of which would have defined authority to check the powers of the others. This philosophy heavily influenced the United States Constitution, according to which the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches of the United States government are kept distinct in order to prevent abuse of power. The American form of separation of powers is associated with a system of checks and balances.

During the Age of Enlightenment, philosophers such as Montesquieu advocated the principle in their writings, whereas others, such as Thomas Hobbes, strongly opposed it. Montesquieu was one of the foremost supporters of separating the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. His writings considerably influenced the Founding Fathers of the United States, such as Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, who participated in the Constitutional Convention of 1787 which drafted the Constitution.

Some U.S. states did not observe a strict separation of powers in the 18th century. In New Jersey, the governor also functioned as a member of the state&#x27;s highest court and as the presiding officer of one house of the New Jersey Legislature. The president of Delaware was a member of the Court of Appeals; the presiding officers of the two houses of the state legislature also served in the executive department as vice presidents. In both Delaware and Pennsylvania, members of the executive council served at the same time as judges. On the other hand, many southern states explicitly required separation of powers. Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia all kept the branches of government &quot;separate and distinct.&quot;

==Legislative power==

Congress has the sole power to legislate for the United States. Under the nondelegation doctrine, Congress may not delegate its lawmaking responsibilities to any other agency. In this vein, the Supreme Court held in the 1998 case &quot;Clinton v. City of New York&quot; that Congress could not delegate a &quot;line-item veto&quot; to the President, by powers vested in the government by the Constitution.

Where Congress does not make great and sweeping delegations of its authority, the Supreme Court has been less stringent. One of the earliest cases involving the exact limits of non-delegation was &quot;Wayman v. Southard&quot; 23 U.S. (10 Wet.) 1, 42 (1825). Congress had delegated to the courts the power to prescribe judicial procedure; it was contended that Congress had thereby unconstitutionally clothed the judiciary with legislative powers. While Chief Justice John Marshall conceded that the determination of rules of procedure was a legislative function, he distinguished between &quot;important&quot; subjects and mere details. Marshall wrote that &quot;a general provision may be made, and power is given to those who are to act under such general provisions, to fill up the details.&quot;

Marshall&#x27;s words and future court decisions gave Congress much latitude in delegating powers. It was not until the 1930s that the Supreme Court held a delegation of authority unconstitutional. In a case involving the creation of the National Recovery Administration called &quot;A.L.A. Schechter Poultry&quot;, 295 U.S. 495 (1935), Congress could not authorize the president to formulate codes of &quot;fair competition.&quot; It was held that Congress must set some standards governing the actions of executive officers. The Court, however, has deemed that phrases such as &quot;just and reasonable,&quot; &quot;public interest&quot; and &quot;public convenience&quot; suffice.

==Executive power==

Executive power is vested, with exceptions and qualifications, in the President. By law (Section 2.) the president becomes the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, Militia of several states when called into service, has power to make treaties and appointments to office &quot;with the Advice and Consent of the Senate,&quot; receive Ambassadors and Public Ministers, and &quot;take care that the laws be faithfully executed&quot; (Section 3.) By using these words, the Constitution does not require the president to personally enforce the law; rather, officers subordinate to the president may perform such duties. The Constitution empowers the president to ensure the faithful execution of the laws made by Congress and approved by the President. Congress may itself terminate such appointments, by impeachment, and restrict the president. Bodies such as the War Claims Commission (created by the War Claims Act of 1948), the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Federal Trade Commission—all quasi-judicial—often have direct Congressional oversight.

Congress often writes legislation to restrain executive officials to the performance of their duties, as laid out by the laws Congress passes. In &quot;Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha&quot; (1983), the Supreme Court decided (a) The prescription for legislative action in Art. I, § 1—requiring all legislative powers to be vested in a Congress consisting of a Senate and a House of Representatives—and § 7—requiring every bill passed by the House and Senate, before becoming law, to be presented to the president, and, if he disapproves, to be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and House—represents the Framers&#x27; decision that the legislative power of the Federal Government be exercised in accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure. This procedure is an integral part of the constitutional design for the separation of powers. Further rulings clarified the case; even both Houses acting together cannot override Executive vetoes without a majority. Legislation may always prescribe regulations governing executive officers.

==Judicial power==

Judicial power—the power to decide cases and controversies—is vested in the Supreme Court and inferior courts established by Congress. The judges must be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate, hold office during good behavior and receive compensations that may not be diminished during their continuance in office. If a court&#x27;s judges do not have such attributes, the court may not exercise the judicial power of the United States. Courts exercising the judicial power are called &quot;constitutional courts.&quot;

However, because Congress controls the budget, jurisdiction, and structure of the federal courts, the judiciary as a branch is better described as largely dependent on Congress rather than independent of it. Although the Constitution, not Congress, creates the Supreme Court, it is Congress that decides whether to create lower federal courts, how to arrange them, how many judges will be appointed to them, and whether to abolish them. Congress also has the power to grant jurisdiction to and withdraw jurisdiction from, lower federal courts. Moreover, although judges have the power to issue final judgments, they must rely on the executive for enforcement.

Congress may also establish &quot;legislative courts,&quot; which do not take the form of judicial agencies or commissions, whose members do not have the same security of tenure or compensation as the constitutional court judges. Legislative courts may not exercise the judicial power of the United States. In &quot;Murray&#x27;s Lessee v. Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co.&quot; (1856), the Supreme Court held that a legislative court may not decide &quot;a suit at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty,&quot; as such a suit is inherently judicial. Legislative courts may only adjudicate &quot;public rights&quot; questions (cases between the government and an individual and political determinations).

==Checks and balances==
===Executive===
The president exercises a check over Congress through their power to veto bills, but Congress may override any veto (excluding the so-called &quot;pocket veto&quot;) by a two-thirds majority in each house. When the two houses of Congress cannot agree on a date for adjournment, the president may settle the dispute. Either house or both houses may be called into emergency session by the president. The Vice President serves as president of the Senate, but they may only vote to break a tie.

The president, as noted above, appoints judges with the Senate&#x27;s advice and consent. They also have the power to issue pardons and reprieves. Such pardons are not subject to confirmation by either the House of Representatives or the Senate, or even to acceptance by the recipient. The President is not mandated to carry out the orders of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court does not have any enforcement power; the enforcement power lies solely with the executive branch. Thus, the executive branch can place a check on the Supreme Court through refusal to execute the orders of the court. However the prestige of the Court makes that difficult to do.

The president is the civilian Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States. They have the authority to command them to take appropriate military action in the event of a sudden crisis. However, only the Congress is explicitly granted the power to declare war per se, as well as to raise, fund and maintain the armed forces. Congress also has the duty and authority to prescribe the laws and regulations under which the armed forces operate, such as the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and requires that all Generals and Admirals appointed by the president be confirmed by a majority vote of the Senate before they can assume their office.

===Judicial===
Courts check both the executive branch and the legislative branch through judicial review. This concept is not written into the Constitution, but was envisioned by many of the Constitution&#x27;s Framers (for example, &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot; mention it). The Supreme Court established a precedent for judicial review in &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot;. There were protests by some at this decision, born chiefly of political expediency, but political realities in the particular case paradoxically restrained opposing views from asserting themselves. For this reason, precedent alone established the principle that a court may strike down a law it deems unconstitutional.

A common misperception is that the Supreme Court is the only court that may determine constitutionality; the power is exercised even by the inferior courts. But only Supreme Court decisions are binding across the nation. Decisions of a Court of Appeals, for instance, are binding only in the circuit over which the court has jurisdiction.

The power to review the constitutionality of laws may be limited by Congress, which has the power to set the jurisdiction of the courts. The only constitutional limit on Congress&#x27; power to set the jurisdiction of the judiciary relates to the Supreme Court; the Supreme Court may exercise only appellate jurisdiction except in cases involving states and cases affecting foreign ambassadors, ministers or consuls.

The Chief Justice presides in the Senate during a president&#x27;s impeachment trial. The rules of the Senate, however, generally do not grant much authority to the presiding officer. Thus, the Chief Justice&#x27;s role in this regard is a limited one.

McCulloch v. Maryland, decided in 1819, established two important principles, one of which explains that states cannot make actions to impede on valid constitutional exercises of power by the federal government. The other explains that Congress has the implied powers to implement the express powers written in the Constitution to create a functional national government. All three branches of the US government have certain powers and those powers relate to the other branches of government. One of these powers is called the express powers. These powers are expressly given, in the Constitution, to each branch of government. Another power is the implied powers. These powers are those that are necessary to perform expressed powers. There are also inherent and concurrent powers. Inherent powers are those that are not found in the Constitution yet the different branches of government can still exercise them. Concurrent powers are those that are given to both state and federal governments. There are also powers that are not lined out in the Constitution that are given to the federal government. These powers are then given to the states in a system called federalism.

Congress is one of the branches of government so it has a lot of powers of its own that it uses to pass laws and establish regulations. These include express, implied, and concurrent powers. It uses its express powers to regulate bankruptcies, business between states and other nations, the armed forces, and the National Guard or militia. They also establish all laws necessary and proper for carrying out other powers. In addition to this Congress makes laws for naturalization. Implied powers are used to keep the regulation of taxes, the draft, immigration, protection of those with disabilities, minimum wage, and outlaw discrimination. Congress&#x27;s inherent powers are used to control national borders, deal with foreign affairs, acquire new territories, defend the state from revolution, and decide the exclusion or establishment of aliens. Concurrent powers makes it so that both federal and state governments can create laws, deal with environmental protection, maintain national parks and prisons, and provide a police force.

The judicial branch of government holds powers as well. They have the ability to use express and concurrent powers to make laws and establish regulations. They use express powers to interpret laws and perform judicial review. Implied powers are used by this branch to declare laws that were previously passed by a lower court unconstitutional. They can also use express powers to declare laws that are in the process of being passed unconstitutional. Concurrent powers are used to make it so that state courts can conduct trials and interpret laws without the approval of federal courts and federal courts can hear appeals form lower state courts.

The executive branch also has powers of its own that they use to make laws and establish regulations. The powers that are used in this branch are express, implied, and inherent. The President uses express powers to approve and veto bills and to make treaties as well. The President is constitutionally obligated to make sure that laws are faithfully executed and uses their powers to do just this. He uses implied powers to issue executive orders and enter into treaties with foreign nations. The executive branch uses inherent powers to establish executive privilege, which means that they can enforce statutes and laws already passed by Congress. They can also enforce the Constitution and treaties that were previously made by other branches of government.

The system of checks and balances makes it so that no one branch of government has more power than another and cannot overthrow another. It creates a balance of power that is necessary for a government to function, if it is to function well. This, in most situations, makes it so that each branch is held to a certain standard of conduct. If a branch of the government thinks that what another branch is doing is unconstitutional, they can &quot;call them out&quot; so to say. Each branch is able to look at the other branches wrongdoing and change it to meet the needs of the people whom they serve. Humans as a whole have a history of abusing positions of power but the system of checks and balances makes it so much more difficult to do so. Also, as there is more than one person running each branch gives room for debate and discussion before decisions are made within a single branch. Even so, some laws have been made and then retracted because they were an abuse of the power given to that particular branch. The people that created these laws had been serving a selfish agenda when forming these laws instead of looking out for the welfare of those people that they were supposed to be protecting by making certain laws. While this is a horrible scenario, it does happen. That does not mean that it cannot be fixed though. Indeed, it can be, by another branch of government stepping up to right the wrongs that had been done.

The federal government is fully capable to intervene in affairs of Native Americans on reservations to some extent. Their ability to create and enforce treaties makes it so that they can interact with the Native Americans and build a treaty that works for both parties and make reservations for the Native Americans to live on and make it so that the people that would live on the reservation not be interrupted by the outside world and be able to live their lives as they please. This responsibility also falls on to the states as well. This happens because the federal government is the one that creates the treaties but the reservations are then put in the jurisdiction of the states. The states are then responsible for maintaining the relationships with the Native Americans on those reservations and to honor the treaties that were previously made by the federal government.

==Equality of the branches==

The Constitution does not explicitly indicate the pre-eminence of any particular branch of government. However, James Madison wrote in Federalist 51, regarding the ability of each branch to defend itself from actions by the others, that &quot;it is not possible to give to each department an equal power of self-defense. In republican government, the legislative authority necessarily predominates.&quot;

One may claim that the judiciary has historically been the weakest of the three branches. In fact, its power to exercise judicial review—its sole meaningful check on the other two branches—is not explicitly granted by the U.S Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court exercised its power to strike down congressional acts as unconstitutional only twice prior to the Civil War: in &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot; (1803) and &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; (1857). The Supreme Court has since then made more extensive use of judicial review.

Throughout America&#x27;s history dominance of one of the three branches has essentially been a see-saw struggle between Congress and the president. Both have had periods of great power and weakness such as immediately after the Civil War when republicans had a majority in Congress and were able to pass major legislation and shoot down most of the president&#x27;s vetoes. They also passed acts to essentially make the president subordinate to Congress, such as the Tenure of Office Act. Johnson&#x27;s later impeachment also cost the presidency much political power. However the president has also exercised greater power largely during the 20th century. Both Roosevelts greatly expanded the powers of the president and wielded great power during their terms.

The first six presidents of the United States did not make extensive use of the veto power: George Washington only vetoed two bills, James Monroe one, and John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and John Quincy Adams none. James Madison, a firm believer in a strong executive, vetoed seven bills. None of the first six Presidents, however, used the veto to direct national policy. It was Andrew Jackson, the seventh President, who was the first to use the veto as a political weapon. During his two terms in office, he vetoed 12 bills—more than all of his predecessors combined. Furthermore, he defied the Supreme Court in enforcing the policy of ethnically cleansing Native American tribes (&quot;Indian Removal&quot;); he stated (perhaps apocryphally), &quot;John Marshall has made his decision. Now let him enforce it!&quot;

Some of Jackson&#x27;s successors made no use of the veto power, while others used it intermittently. It was only after the Civil War that presidents began to use the power to truly counterbalance Congress. Andrew Johnson, a Democrat, vetoed several Reconstruction bills passed by the &quot;Radical Republicans.&quot; Congress, however, managed to override fifteen of Johnson&#x27;s twenty-nine vetoes. Furthermore, it attempted to curb the power of the presidency by passing the Tenure of Office Act. The Act required Senate approval for the dismissal of senior Cabinet officials. When Johnson deliberately violated the Act, which he felt was unconstitutional (Supreme Court decisions later vindicated such a position), the House of Representatives impeached him; he was acquitted in the Senate by one vote.

Johnson&#x27;s impeachment was perceived to have done great damage to the presidency, which came to be almost subordinate to Congress. Some believed that the president would become a mere figurehead, with the Speaker of the House of Representatives becoming a &quot;de facto&quot; prime minister. Grover Cleveland, the first Democratic President following Johnson, attempted to restore the power of his office. During his first term, he vetoed over 400 bills—twice as many bills as his 21 predecessors combined. He also began to suspend bureaucrats who were appointed as a result of the patronage system, replacing them with more &quot;deserving&quot; individuals. The Senate, however, refused to confirm many new nominations, instead demanding that Cleveland turn over the confidential records relating to the suspensions. Cleveland steadfastly refused, asserting, &quot;These suspensions are my executive acts ... I am not responsible to the Senate, and I am unwilling to submit my actions to them for judgment.&quot; Cleveland&#x27;s popular support forced the Senate to back down and confirm the nominees. Furthermore, Congress finally repealed the controversial Tenure of Office Act that had been passed during the Johnson Administration. Overall, this meant that Cleveland&#x27;s Administration marked the end of presidential subordination.

Several 20th-century presidents have attempted to greatly expand the power of the presidency. Theodore Roosevelt, for instance, claimed that the president was permitted to do whatever was not explicitly prohibited by the law—in direct contrast to his immediate successor, William Howard Taft. Franklin Delano Roosevelt held considerable power during the Great Depression. Congress had granted Franklin Roosevelt sweeping authority; in &quot;Panama Refining v. Ryan&quot;, the Court for the first time struck down a Congressional delegation of power as violative of the doctrine of separation of powers. The aforementioned &quot;Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States&quot;, another separation of powers case, was also decided during Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s presidency. In response to many unfavorable Supreme Court decisions, Roosevelt introduced a &quot;Court Packing&quot; plan, under which more seats would be added to the Supreme Court for the president to fill. Such a plan (which was defeated in Congress) would have seriously undermined the judiciary&#x27;s independence and power.

Richard Nixon used national security as a basis for his expansion of power. He asserted, for example, that &quot;the inherent power of the President to safeguard the security of the nation&quot; authorized him to order a wiretap without a judge&#x27;s warrant. Nixon also asserted that &quot;executive privilege&quot; shielded him from all legislative oversight; furthermore, he impounded federal funds (that is to say, he refused to spend money that Congress had appropriated for government programs). In the specific cases aforementioned, however, the Supreme Court ruled against Nixon. This was also because of an ongoing criminal investigation into the Watergate tapes, even though they acknowledged the general need for executive privilege. Since then, Nixon&#x27;s successors have sometimes asserted that they may act in the interests of national security or that executive privilege shields them from Congressional oversight. Though such claims have in general been more limited than Nixon&#x27;s, one may still conclude that the presidency&#x27;s power has been greatly augmented since the 18th and 19th centuries.

==Views on separation of powers==
Many political scientists believe that separation of powers is a decisive factor in what they see as a limited degree of American exceptionalism. In particular, John W. Kingdon made this argument, claiming that separation of powers contributed to the development of a unique political structure in the United States. He attributes the unusually large number of interest groups active in the United States, in part, to the separation of powers; it gives groups more places to try to influence, and creates more potential group activity. He also cites its complexity as one of the reasons for lower citizen participation.

==Judicial independence==
Separation of powers has again become a current issue of some controversy concerning debates about judicial independence and political efforts to increase the accountability of judges for the quality of their work, avoiding conflicts of interest, and charges that some judges allegedly disregard procedural rules, statutes, and higher court precedents.

Many legislators hold the view that separation of powers means that powers are shared among different branches; no one branch may act unilaterally on issues (other than perhaps minor questions), but must obtain some form of agreement across branches. That is, it is argued that &quot;checks and balances&quot; apply to the Judicial branch as well as to the other branches—for example, in the regulation of attorneys and judges, and the establishment by Congress of rules for the conduct of federal courts, and by state legislatures for state courts. Although in practice these matters are delegated to the Supreme Court, the Congress holds these powers and delegates them to the Supreme Court only for convenience in light of the Supreme Court&#x27;s expertise, but can withdraw that delegation at any time.

On the other side of this debate, many judges hold the view that separation of powers means that the Judiciary is independent and untouchable within the judicial sphere. In this view, separation of powers means that the Judiciary alone holds all powers relative to the judicial function and that the Legislative and Executive branches may not interfere in any aspect of the Judicial branch. An example of the second view at the state level is found in the Florida Supreme Court holding that only the Florida Supreme Court may license and regulate attorneys appearing before the courts of Florida, and only the Florida Supreme Court may set rules for procedures in the Florida courts. The State of New Hampshire also follows this system.

<text>Jennifer Miller (born 1961) is an American circus entertainer, writer, and professor at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York. She has lived with a beard for most of her life. She is a juggler and fire eater. Miller lives in New York City.

==Biography==
Miller is the youngest daughter of two Quaker professors and grew up in Connecticut and California. Miller became involved in the performing arts and theater while in high school, and was involved in the downtown dance scene in New York in the early 1980s. In her career as a performing artist, which has spanned over 20 years, she has performed with numerous choreographers and dancers, several circus companies, and in the Coney Island SideShow. Miller has also collaborated on theatrical works with Sarah Schulman.

In 1989, she established the acclaimed NYC political performance troupe Circus Amok. She was also a focus of Tami Gold&#x27;s documentary &quot;Juggling Gender,&quot; an exploratory piece addressing themes of androgyny, gender classification and identification, feminism, and femaleness through a singular focal character, Jennifer Miller herself. Circus Amok has been the subject of numerous documentary films. Miller is widely recognized for her work and is the recipient of awards including the Obie, Bessie, BAX 10, and, most recently, the Ethyl Eichelberger Award. She currently teaches in New York at Pratt Institute, and has taught at several universities including UCLA, Cal Arts, Scripps College, Trinity/La MaMa Performing Arts Program and NYU.

In 2010, Miller served as a co-hostess to Vaginal Davis&#x27; performance piece &quot;Speaking from the Diaphragm&quot; at Performance Space 122.

<doc id="738691" wikidata="Q1421778" url="?curid=738691" title="John Myatt">
<text>John Myatt, (born 1945), is a British artist convicted of art forgery who, with John Drewe, perpetrated what has been described as &quot;the biggest art fraud of the 20th century&quot;. In 1999 he was convicted of conspiracy to defraud and imprisoned for four months. Since his conviction, Myatt has continued to paint in the style of famous artists, selling his works as &quot;genuine fakes&quot;.

==Early life==
The son of a farmer, Myatt attended art school and discovered a talent for mimicking other artists&#x27; styles but at first only painted for amusement and for friends. He worked as a songwriter for a time and claims authorship of the song &quot;Silly Games&quot;, a UK no. 2 hit for Janet Kay in 1979, although this is attributed by Kay to producer Dennis Bovell and credited to Diana Bovell. He later worked as a teacher in Staffordshire.

==Painting==
When his wife left him in 1985, Myatt gave up teaching to spend more time with his children, and attempted to make a living by painting original works in the style of well-known artists. He placed an advertisement in &quot;Private Eye&quot; magazine which read &quot;Genuine fakes. Nineteenth and twentieth century paintings from £150&quot;. He was initially honest about the nature of his paintings, but John Drewe, a regular customer, was able to re-sell some of his paintings as genuine works. When he later told Myatt that Christie&#x27;s had accepted his &quot;Albert Gleizes&quot; painting as genuine and paid £25,000, Myatt became a willing accomplice to Drewe&#x27;s fraud, and began to paint more pictures in the style of masters like Roger Bissière, Marc Chagall, Le Corbusier, Jean Dubuffet, Alberto Giacometti, Matisse, Ben Nicholson, Nicolas de Staël and Graham Sutherland.

==Forgeries==
According to the police estimates, Myatt painted about 200 forgeries in a regular schedule and delivered them to Drewe in London. Police later recovered only sixty of them. Drewe sold them to the auction houses of Christie&#x27;s, Phillips and Sotheby&#x27;s and to dealers in London, Paris and New York.

==Arrest and trial==
In September 1995, Myatt was arrested by Scotland Yard detectives. He quickly confessed, stating that he had created the paintings using emulsion paint and K-Y Jelly, a mixture that dried quickly but was hardly reminiscent of the original pigments. He estimated that he had earned around £275,000, and offered to return the money and help convict Drewe. He had come to dislike the deception and Drewe. However the total sum of profits made through Myatt&#x27;s forgeries exceeds €25 million.

On 16 April 1996 police raided Drewe&#x27;s gallery in Reigate, Surrey, south of London, and found materials he had used to forge certificates of authenticity. Drewe had also altered the provenances of genuine paintings to link them to Myatt&#x27;s forgeries, and added bogus documents to archives of various institutions in order to &quot;prove&quot; the authenticity of the forgeries.

The trial of Myatt and Drewe began in September 1998. On 13 February 1999 John Myatt was sentenced to one year in prison for a conspiracy to defraud. He was released the following June after serving four months of his sentence. Drewe was sentenced to six years for conspiracy and served two.

==Current career==
After his release, Myatt has continued to paint commissioned portraits and clear copies, and has held exhibitions of his work. His &quot;genuine fakes&quot; are popular amongst collectors as an affordable alternative for a highly sought-after artist or artwork. Some of his most copied artworks include Impressionist and Post-Impressionist artists, Claude Monet and Vincent van Gogh.

In 2020 it is reported that a film is to be made about Myatt&#x27;s case, written by Justin Michel and Julie Daly-Wallman. It is a Green Eye Production Academy production and with the confirmed title &quot;Genuine Fakes&quot;. John Myatt now works alongside law enforcement in helping to expose fraudsters.

Myatt also has a television show on Sky Arts called &quot;Fame in the Frame&quot;. He has a private sitting with one celebrity each episode and paints a portrait of them in the style of a famous artist. Episodes include painting singer and songwriter Ian Brown in the style of Paul Cézanne and actor and comedian Stephen Fry in the style of Diego Velázquez. Myatt now hosts his own series – &quot;Virgin Virtuosos on Sky Arts&quot;, where he takes celebrities and recreates a famous painting.

Myatt has said of his works, When I paint in the style of one of the greats… Monet, Picasso, Van Gogh… I am not simply creating a copy or pale imitation of the original. Just as an actor immerses himself into a character, I climb into the minds and lives of each artist. I adopt their techniques and search for the inspiration behind each great artist’s view of the world. Then, and only then, do I start to paint a ‘Legitimate Fake’.

<text>John Drewe (born 1948) is a British purveyor of art forgeries who commissioned artist John Myatt to paint them. Drewe earned about £1.8 million executing these art crimes.

==Early life==
Drewe was born John Cockett in 1948 in Sussex, England. At the age of 17 he dropped out of school and changed his surname to Drewe. He worked briefly with the British Atomic Energy Authority, having initially convinced his superiors that he had a Ph.D. in physics. He resigned two years later, after this was found to be false. After that, there is a 15-year gap in official records about him — no employment or tax records.

According to Drewe himself, he joined the student protests in Paris in 1968, moved to West Germany and studied physics in the Kiel University. When he moved back to the UK, he taught experimental physics at the University of Sussex for a year and received a second degree in physics at SUNY Buffalo. None of those educational institutions have his name on their records.

In 1970 Drewe, claiming a PhD in physics, worked for a year as head of the Physics Department of Bexhill Grammar School in East Sussex.

In 1980, Drewe met wealthy Israeli expatriate Bat-Sheva Goudsmid and soon moved into her house, having charmed her with claims that he was an advisor to the Atomic Energy Authority, a British Aerospace board member, and worked for the Ministry of Defence. In fact, he was teaching physics in a Jewish private school in Highgate until he was apparently pressured to leave in 1985.

==Career as a forger==
Also in 1985, Drewe met John Myatt, who was in dire need of money. First Drewe presented himself as a nuclear physicist who wanted art copies for his own home and hinted at links to British intelligence. Eventually he persuaded Myatt to paint forgeries for him. He used mud and vacuum cleaner dust to &quot;age&quot; them. Drewe contacted auction houses like Christie&#x27;s and Sotheby&#x27;s through intermediaries and sold about 200 of Myatt&#x27;s paintings for £1.8 million. In the course of their many year relationship he gave Myatt a total of only £100,000 while he lived lavishly off the proceeds.

Drewe did not try to sell paintings in a vacuum but created false backgrounds for them. He forged certificates of authenticity and even invoices of previous sales to establish false provenance and paper trails for the paintings. He wrote to relatives of the artist to fool them into authenticating the forgeries. He tricked a small Catholic religious order in a village to sign a contract which would verify some of the paintings.

He also forged documents about previous owners so that the painting did not just suddenly seem to appear from nowhere. For this he used records of dead people, some of them his old acquaintances. He also convinced some of his living friends to sign documents as though they were previous owners of the paintings — most of them were broke or otherwise in trouble and accepted the money he offered them. To an old childhood friend, Daniel Stokes, he concocted a story about a drinking wife and needy children and convinced him to pretend to be an owner of a fake Ben Nicholson painting. Clive Bellman, another acquaintance, was told that the paintings were sold to provide money for purchases of archival materials from the Soviet Union about the Holocaust. When he could not find anyone to bribe, he just invented nonexistent people.

In 1989, Drewe gained access to the letter archives of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London by claiming to be an interested collector. He also donated two paintings — Myatt&#x27;s forgeries — for a fundraising auction. Later he used the institute&#x27;s stationery in his fake documents. The Tate Gallery received a donation of two Roger Bissière paintings but Bissière&#x27;s son did not accept them. Drewe withdrew the paintings but he made a donation of £20,000 (about US$32,000) to the gallery, so the gallery opened its archives to him. To become accepted by the Victoria and Albert Museum he needed a false reference — he provided one himself.

Drewe used the opportunity to introduce false records to the archives. He replaced old pages and inserted numerous new ones into old art catalogues to include Myatt&#x27;s forgeries. The institutions have said that it will take years to purge the archives of all the false information. Through a middleman, Drewe also created a company called &quot;Art Research Associates&quot; and again used himself as a reference.

In 1995, Drewe left Goudsmid to marry Helen Sussman, a doctor. Goudsmid studied papers that Drewe had left behind and found a number of incriminating letters. She decided to tell the police and the Tate Gallery.

==1995 arrest==
In September 1995, Scotland Yard quietly arrested Myatt. He had fallen out with Drewe and agreed to cooperate. On 16 April 1996 police raided Drewe&#x27;s house in Reigate, Surrey, and found materials he had used to forge certificates of authenticity. They also found two catalogues Drewe had stolen from the Victoria and Albert Museum. Police also found evidence that another artist in addition to Myatt might have supplied some of the forgeries.

During the interrogation, Drewe continuously protested his innocence against all evidence. He was released on bail and disappeared. Two months later police found him by following his mother.

This time, Drewe had concocted a conspiracy theory of frame-up. He claimed that he was an arms dealer and a fall guy for a conspiracy including British law enforcement and governments of seven countries and that there had been a total of 4,000 forgeries that had been used to finance arms deals between the UK arms industry and Iran, Iraq and Sierra Leone. He also claimed that he was a British intelligence agent, that Myatt was a neo-Nazi operative and that Robert Harris, a name mentioned in many forged certificates, was a South African arms dealer. He could not prove any of these stories.

If he had intended to scare police to drop the case, he failed. The prosecution declared his story pure fantasy and charged him.

The trial against Drewe and Myatt began in September 1998. Drewe fired his lawyer because he refused to use Drewe&#x27;s story as a defence and decided to defend himself. Again he failed; Myatt called him a liar to his face and the jury declared him guilty in six hours.

On 13 February 1999 Drewe was sentenced to six years for conspiracy to defraud, two counts of forgery, one of theft, and one of using a false instrument with intent. He served two years in prison.

==Later criminal activity==
In March 2012 at Norwich Crown Court, Drewe was convicted of defrauding a 71-year-old retired music teacher of her life savings of £700,000 and leaving her penniless. He was jailed for eight years by a judge who told him “In my view you are about the most dishonest and devious person I have ever dealt with&quot;.

<doc id="738695" wikidata="Q2330895" url="?curid=738695" title="Francis Tresham">
<text>Francis Tresham ( 1567 – 23 December 1605) was a member of the group of English provincial Catholics who planned the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605, a conspiracy to assassinate King James I of England.

Tresham joined the Earl of Essex&#x27;s failed rebellion against the government in 1601, for which he was imprisoned. Only his family&#x27;s intervention and his father&#x27;s money saved him from attainder. Despite this, he became involved in two missions to Catholic Spain to seek support for English Catholics (then heavily persecuted), and finally with the Gunpowder Plotters.

According to his confession, Tresham joined the plot in October 1605. Its leader, Robert Catesby, asked him to provide a large sum of money and the use of Rushton Hall, but Tresham apparently provided neither, instead giving a much smaller amount of money to fellow plotter Thomas Wintour. Tresham also expressed concern that if the plot was successful, two of his brothers-in-law would be killed. An anonymous letter delivered to one of them, William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, found its way to the English Secretary of State, Robert Cecil, an event which eventually proved decisive in the conspiracy&#x27;s failure.

Historians have long suspected that Tresham wrote the letter, a hypothesis that remains unproven. Catesby and Wintour shared the same suspicion and threatened to kill him, but he was able to convince them otherwise. He was arrested on 12 November and confined to the Tower of London. In his confession, he sought to allay his involvement in the plot, but never mentioned the letter. He died of natural causes on 23 December 1605.

==Family and life before 1605==
Born in about 1567, Francis Tresham was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Tresham, of Rushton Hall in Northamptonshire, and Meriel Throckmorton, daughter of Sir Robert Throckmorton of Coughton in Warwickshire and his wife Elizabeth Hussey. According to the antiquary Anthony Wood, Tresham was educated in Oxford at either St John&#x27;s College or Gloucester Hall or both, although biographer Mark Nicholls mentions that there appears to be no other evidence to corroborate that claim.

Francis is said to have been a fellow prisoner with Robert Catesby held in Wisbech Castle at the time of the Spanish Armada.

He married Anne Tufton, daughter of Sir John Tufton of Hothfield in Kent, in 1593. The couple had three children, twins Lucy and Thomas (b.1598), and Elizabeth. Thomas died in infancy, Lucy became a nun in Brussels, and Elizabeth married Sir George Heneage of Hainton, Lincolnshire.

Tresham&#x27;s father, born near the end of Henry VIII&#x27;s reign, was regarded by the Catholic community as one of its leaders. Thomas was received into the Catholic Church in 1580, and in the same year he allowed the Jesuit Edmund Campion to stay at his house in Hoxton. For the latter, following Campion&#x27;s capture in 1581, he was tried in Star Chamber. Thomas&#x27;s refusal to fully comply with his interrogators was the beginning of years of fines and spells in prison. He proclaimed the accession of James I to the English throne, but the king&#x27;s promises to Thomas of forestry commissions and an end to recusancy fines were not kept. His finances were seriously depleted by fines of £7,720 for recusancy, and the spending of £12,200 on the marriages of six daughters meant that when he died in 1605, his estate was £11,500 in debt.

Author Antonia Fraser suggests that as a young man Francis became &quot;resentful of his father&#x27;s authority and profligate with his father&#x27;s money.&quot; Authors Peter Marshall and Geoffrey Scott describe him as possessing a &quot;somewhat hot-headed nature&quot;, while another source calls him a &quot;wild unstayed man&quot;. The Jesuit priest Oswald Tesimond wrote that he was &quot;a man of sound judgement. He knew how to look after himself, but was not much to be trusted&quot;. While still young he assaulted a man and his pregnant daughter, claiming that their family owed his father money. Tresham spent time in prison for this offence.

On 8 February 1601 he joined the Earl of Essex in open rebellion against the government. Essex&#x27;s aim was to secure his own ambitions, but the Jesuit Henry Garnet described the young men who accompanied him as being interested mostly in furthering the Catholic cause. Captured and imprisoned, Tresham appealed to Katherine Howard, but was rebuked. His sister, Lady Mounteagle, alerted his cousin John Throckmorton, who turned to &quot;three most honorable parsons and one especiall instrument&quot; for help. The identity of these individuals is unclear, but Tresham was promised freedom on the condition that over the next three months his father pay £2,100 to William Ayloffe, to &quot;save his lyef attainder in bloode.&quot; He was released on 21 June. The experience did not dissuade him from engaging in further conspiracies; in 1602 and 1603 he was involved in the missions to Catholic Spain made by Thomas Wintour, Anthony Dutton (possibly an alias of Christopher Wright) and Guy Fawkes, later dubbed by the English government as the Spanish Treason. However, upon James&#x27;s accession to the throne, he told Thomas Wintour (secretary to Tresham&#x27;s brother-in-law William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle), that he would &quot;stand wholly for the King&quot;, and &quot;to have no speech with him of Spain.&quot;

His father tried to have him appointed as keeper of the deer parks at Brigstock. This was resisted by the villagers in May 1603, who objected to the Tresham family&#x27;s recusancy. One of Tresham&#x27;s servants Thomas Walker was installed at a lodge in Brigstock and Catholics gathered at the lodge at night.

==Introduction==

English Catholics had hoped that the persecution of their faith would end when James succeeded Elizabeth I, as he appeared to hold more moderate views toward Catholics than his predecessor but Robert Catesby, a religious zealot also imprisoned for his involvement in the Essex rebellion, had grown tired of James&#x27;s supposed perfidy and planned to kill the king. He hoped to achieve this by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder and inciting a popular revolt to install James&#x27;s daughter Princess Elizabeth as titular Queen.

Catesby had recruited 11 fellow Catholics to his cause but was running out of money. Even with his debts, with an annual income of over £3,000 Tresham was one of the wealthiest people known to the plotters, and Catesby&#x27;s mother was Anne Throckmorton, an aunt of Tresham&#x27;s. The two cousins had been raised together and shared a close relationship.

Despite their shared upbringing and involvement in the Spanish Treason, the conspirators chose not to reveal the plot to him until 14 October 1605, shortly after his father died, and just weeks before the planned explosion. According to his confession, the meeting took place at the home of Tresham&#x27;s brother-in-law, Lord Stourton, in Clerkenwell. Tresham claimed to have questioned Catesby on the morality of the plot, asking if it was spiritually &quot;damnable&quot;. Catesby replied that it was not, at which point Tresham highlighted the danger that all Catholics would face should the plot succeed. Catesby replied, &quot;The necessity of the Catholics&quot; was such that &quot;it must needs be done&quot;. He wanted two things from Tresham: £2,000, and the use of Rushton Hall; Catesby received neither. Tresham had no money to spare, his father&#x27;s debts having reduced his inheritance, although he paid a small sum to Thomas Wintour, on the understanding that the latter was to travel to the Low Countries. Following the meeting, he hurried back to Rushton Hall and closed his household, taking care to hide family papers (not discovered until 1838). He then returned to London with his mother and sisters, and on 2 November acquired a licence to travel abroad with his servants and horses.

==Monteagle letter==
Later in October, during a meeting at which Tresham was present, the conspirators discussed the fates of several notable Catholic peers. Foremost in Tresham&#x27;s thoughts were the lives of two brothers-in-law, William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, and Edward Stourton, 10th Baron Stourton, but Catesby proclaimed that &quot;the innocent must perish with the guilty, sooner than ruin the chances of success.&quot; As the last few details were being finalised that month, on Saturday 26 October Monteagle received an anonymous letter while at his house in Hoxton. It contained the following message:

Uncertain of its meaning, Monteagle delivered it to the English Secretary of State, Robert Cecil.

Tresham has long been suspected as the letter&#x27;s author. Mark Nicholls states that he almost certainly wrote it, pointing to the fact that once Catesby was made aware of its existence he immediately suspected Tresham and went with Thomas Wintour to confront him. The two threatened to &quot;hang him&quot;, but &quot;with such oaths and emphatic assertions&quot; Tresham managed to convince the pair of his innocence, the next day urging them by letter to abandon the plot. Antonia Fraser suggests that Catesby and Wintour&#x27;s decision to believe him should not be disregarded. While making his deathbed confession in the Tower of London, Tresham failed to mention the letter; an omission which in her opinion makes no sense if he is to be regarded as its author, especially considering that its recipient was by then being credited as the country&#x27;s saviour. Author Alan Haynes views Tresham as the most likely culprit, but raises the possibility that Cecil penned the letter himself, to protect a source.

==Revealed==
Although he was already aware of certain stirrings even before he received the letter, Cecil did not yet know the exact nature of the plot or who was involved and had elected to watch to see what would happen. When Monteagle&#x27;s letter was shown to the king on Friday 1 November, James felt that it hinted at &quot;some stratagem of fire and powder&quot;, perhaps an explosion exceeding in violence the one that killed his father, Lord Darnley, in 1567. The following day, members of the Privy Council visited James to inform him that a search would be made of the Houses of Parliament, &quot;both above and below&quot;. Meanwhile, Tresham again urged Catesby and Wintour to abandon the scheme, but his attempts were in vain. Fellow plotter Thomas Percy said he was ready to &quot;abide the uttermost trial&quot;, and subsequently on 4 November Catesby and several others left London for the Midlands to prepare for the planned uprising.

Fawkes was arrested while guarding the explosives shortly after midnight on 5 November 1605. Calling himself John Johnson, he was at first interrogated by members of the King&#x27;s Privy Chamber, but on 6 November James ordered that &quot;John Johnson&quot; be tortured. His will finally broken, he revealed his true identity on 7 November, and on 8 November he began to name some of those with whom he was associated. Tresham&#x27;s complicity was not revealed until the following day, although he was attributed with only a minor role. But while his compatriots had fled London the moment they discovered that Fawkes had been captured, Tresham had stayed in the city. He was arrested on 12 November and transferred to the Tower three days later. Catesby and several other plotters were killed on 8 November, during an armed siege at Holbeche House in Staffordshire.

==Death==

Although at first he was uncooperative, on 13 November Tresham confessed to being involved in the plot, outlining his version of events to his interrogators. Moving his family from the safety of Rushton was, he pointed out, not the action of a man who believed he was taking them into &quot;the very mouth and fury&quot; of the plot. He admitted to the government that he was guilty only of the plot&#x27;s concealment, denying that he had ever been an active member of the conspiracy, although by the end of the month he had also admitted his involvement in the Spanish Treason of 1602–1603. He claimed to have persuaded Thomas Wintour and Thomas Percy to postpone the explosion, and that he had planned to inform the king&#x27;s secretary Thomas Lake of a &quot;Puritan conspiracy&quot;. Fraser views much of his confession as &quot;highly partial ... not only for his own sake but for that of his wife and children&quot;, and important in serving to highlight his unreliability.

Tresham suffered from a strangury caused by an inflammation of his urinary tract, and in December 1605 his health began to decline. Lieutenant of the Tower William Waad, wondering if Tresham would live long enough for justice to take its course, described his condition as &quot;worse and worse&quot;. Tresham preferred the services of a Dr Richard Foster over those of the Tower&#x27;s regular doctor Matthew Gwinne; apparently Foster understood his case, indicating that it was not the first occasion on which he had treated him. During his last days, he was attended by three more doctors and a nurse, along with William Vavasour, a rumoured illegitimate child of Thomas Tresham and possibly Francis&#x27;s half-brother. As Tresham&#x27;s wife, Anne, was apparently too upset, Vavasour wrote Tresham&#x27;s deathbed confession and also an account of his last hours. Tresham apologised to the Jesuit priest Henry Garnet for implicating him in the Spanish Treason, and used the rest of his deathbed confession to protest his innocence. Anne and William read prayers at his bedside; he died at 2:00 am on 23 December. Despite not being tried, his head joined those of Catesby and Percy on display at Northampton, while his body was thrown into a hole at Tower Hill. His estates passed to his brother Lewis. Tresham&#x27;s apology never reached its intended target, and his letter, along with the discovery of Garnet&#x27;s &quot;Of Equivocation&quot;, found among the &quot;heretical, treasonable and damnable books&quot; at Tresham&#x27;s chamber in the Inner Temple, was used to great effect by Sir Edward Coke in Garnet&#x27;s trial. The priest was executed in May 1606.

<text>Otto Wacker (1898–1970) was a German art dealer who became infamous for commissioning and selling forgeries of paintings by Vincent van Gogh. He had gained a good reputation in the 1920s after false starts in various other professions. Since the end of World War II, he lived in East Berlin. A study of his life and times has been written by Modris Eksteins.

== Wacker&#x27;s Case==
Otto Wacker became an art dealer in 1925. He developed a reputation for reliability in the art field. The fraudulent Van Goghs were probably the work of his brother, the painter and restorer Leonhard Wacker. Otto&#x27;s father, Hans, was also an artist.

Wacker managed to convince prominent Van Gogh experts Jacob Baart de la Faille, Hendrik P. Bremmer, Julius Meier-Graefe and that the paintings he was selling were genuine and they supplied certificates of authenticity without proof of provenance. These experts accepted his account that a Russian had bought the paintings, transferred them to Switzerland illegally, and had commissioned an illegal agent to sell them. They understood the need for this Russian to remain anonymous in order to prevent reprisals from relatives who still lived in the Soviet Union. Thannhauser, Matthiesen and Goldschmidt galleries bought some of the paintings.

Wacker&#x27;s paintings were to be exhibited in January 1928 by the firm of Paul Cassirer in Berlin. It was organized to coincide with the publication of de la Faille&#x27;s standard catalogue of Van Gogh&#x27;s work. When Wacker delivered the last four paintings, and Walter Feilchenfeldt, the general managers of the exhibition, noticed the differences and recognized them as fakes. The canvases were returned to Wacker. Further investigation revealed 33 suspect paintings, all of them supplied by Wacker. Galleries that had sold his paintings asked their customers to return them. Hugo Perls, an art dealer and lawyer who had bought several paintings, still insisted that they were authentic. In December 1928 the Matthiesen gallery, with the aid of the Federation of German Art and Antique Dealers, sued Wacker.

De la Faille responded to the accusations by publishing a supplement to his catalogue in November 1928, which listed all the paintings supplied by Wacker as fakes. In 1930 de la Faille published &quot;Les faux van Goghs&quot; (&quot;The False Van Goghs&quot;) which again listed the suspect paintings among 174 that he regarded as forgeries. In May 1929 the studios of Wacker&#x27;s father and brother were raided by police, who seized nine paintings from Hans and twelve from Leonhard. The latter claimed that the paintings were only in his studio for restoration. The National Gallery in Berlin analysed the paints used in the seized artworks; they discovered the presence of a resin used to accelerate the drying process, which had not been found in any genuine van Goghs.

The trial against Wacker began on 6 April 1932. Vincent Willem van Gogh, nephew of the painter, gave the first evidence at the trial and stated that family records did not include any Russian who would have purchased any paintings. De la Faille, on the other hand, had changed his mind once again and claimed that five of the paintings were genuine. During the trial, various experts did not come to full agreement on what paintings were authentic (and the argument was to continue in some circles for years afterwards). Bremmer argued that at least 9 paintings were genuine. Meier-Graefe admitted his mistake and even that the expert opinion could be fallible. Hans Rosenhagen said that 14 of the works were inferior but genuine. However, the Dutch restorer A M de Wild found that the pigments used in the paintings were not similar to those Van Gogh had used. Art restorer Kurt Wehlte showed with X-rays that the painting techniques were different (although he used a painting that was declared a forgery in the 1970s). Later it was found that the paintings had not been painted on French canvases at all. On 19 April 1932 Wacker was charged with fraud, and after an appeal, was sentenced to 19 months in prison and a fine of . Some former directors of the Bank für Deutsche Beamte, who had been speculating on the paintings on behalf of the bank, were sued. A few of the incriminated paintings have disappeared since the close of the affair.

<doc id="738698" wikidata="Q78589" url="?curid=738698" title="Emil Jellinek">
<text>Emil Jellinek, known after 1903 as Emil Jellinek-Mercedes (6 April 1853 – 21 January 1918), was an automobile entrepreneur of the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG), responsible in 1900 for commissioning the first modern automobile, the Mercedes 35hp. Jellinek created the Mercedes trademark in 1902, naming it in honor of his daughter, Mercédès Jellinek.

The trademark developed into the company Mercedes-Benz, and the marque became one of the largest car brands in the world. Jellinek lived in Vienna, Austria, then later moved to Nice, on the French Riviera, where he was General Consul of Austria-Hungary.

==Early life==
Jellinek was born in Leipzig, Germany, the son of Adolf Jellinek (sometimes known as Aaron Jellinek). His father was a well-known Czech-Hungarian rabbi and intellectual in the Jewish communities of Leipzig and Vienna. Jellinek&#x27;s mother, Rosalie Bettelheim (born 1832 in Budapest, died 1892 in Baden bei Wien), was an active rebbitzen. He had two brothers, both of whom achieved fame: Max Hermann Jellinek, as a linguist, and Georg Jellinek, as an international law teacher. His sisters were Charlotte and Pauline.

The family moved, shortly after Jellinek&#x27;s birth, to Vienna. He found paying attention to school work difficult and dropped out of several schools, including Sonderhausen. His parents were displeased with his performance, while Jellinek began to indulge in practical jokes. In 1870, when he was 17, his parents found him a job as a clerk in a Moravian railway company, Rot-Koestelec North-Western. Jellinek worked two years before being fired by management, upon discovery that he had been organising train races late at night.

==Diplomat and businessman (1872 to 1893)==
In 1872, when 19 years old, he moved to France. There, through his father&#x27;s connections, Schmidl, the Austro-Hungarian Consul in Morocco, requested his services, getting Jellinek diplomatic posts at Tangier and Tetouan, successively. In Tetouan, he met Rachel Goggmann, an Algerian-born illegitimate daughter of a &quot;Sephardi&quot; mother, Meriem Azoulay, adopted by the husband of the mother, Moise Goggmann (Gogman), a Jew from Lorraine.

In 1874, Jellinek was conscripted for military service in Vienna, but was declared unfit. He resumed his diplomatic career as Austrian vice-consul at Oran, Algeria, and also began trading Algerian tobacco to Europeans, in partnership with Rachel&#x27;s father.

He also worked as an inspector for the French &quot;Aigle&quot; insurance company and traveled to Vienna briefly in 1881 at the age of 28 to open one of its branch offices. Returning to Oran, he married Rachel, and their first two sons Adolph and Fernand were born there.
Two years later, in 1884, Jellinek joined the insurance company full-time and moved with the family to Baden bei Wien, Austria, where they lived in the house of a wine dealer named Hanni. His first daughter, Mercédès Jellinek, was born in Baden on September 16, 1889; the name &quot;Mercédès&quot; means &quot;favor&quot;, &quot;kindness&quot;, &quot;mercy&quot;, or &quot;pardon&quot; in Spanish. Rachel died four years later, and was buried in Nice. Even so, Jellinek came to believe the name Mercedes brought good fortune and called all his properties after it. One of his sons wrote: &quot;He was as superstitious as the ancient Romans.&quot;

Jellinek&#x27;s insurance business and stock-market trading became very successful, and they started to spend the winters in Nice on the fashionable French Riviera, eventually moving there and establishing links with both international business people and the local aristocracy.

Helped by his diplomatic career, he became the Austrian Consul General in Nice, and began selling automobiles, mainly French makes, to European aristocrats spending winter vacations in the region. Associated with the automobile business were Leon Desjoyeaux, from Nice, and Alsatian cyclist Karl Lehmann, who acquired the sole French agency and adopted the alias of &quot;C. L. Charley&quot;. Jellinek acquired a large mansion which he named &quot;Villa Mercedes&quot; to run the business from and by 1897 he was selling about 140 cars a year and started calling them &quot;Mercedes&quot;. The car business was by now more profitable than his insurance work.

It was in Nice that Jellinek became enthralled by the automobile, studying any information that he could gather about it and purchasing successively: a &quot;De Dion-Bouton&quot;, a &quot;Léon-Bollée Voiturette&quot;, both three-wheelers, and a four-seat &quot;Benz&quot; &quot;motorized-coach&quot;. Jellinek greatly admired automobile designer Wilhelm Maybach&#x27;s work. He promised to buy a shipment of 36 automobiles for 550,000 goldmarks if Maybach could design a great race car for him following his specifications. The prototype was finished in December 1900 and, in 1901 went on to have a string of racing successes. Its engine was baptized Daimler-Mercedes.

In 1899 he married Madelaine Henriette Engler (Anaise Jellinek), and had four more children: Alain Didier, Guy, Rene and Andree (Maya).

==Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG), 1896–1900==

Seeing an advertisement for a DMG car in the weekly magazine &quot;Fliegende Blätter&quot;, Jellinek, now aged 43, travelled to Cannstatt, (near Stuttgart), in 1896, to find out more about the company, its factory, and the designers Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach. He placed an order for one of the &quot;Daimler&quot; cars and took delivery in October of that year.

The car, a &quot;Phoenix Double-Phaeton&quot; with 8 hp engine, could reach 24 km/h (15 mph). Maybach had designed the &quot;DMG-Phoenix&quot; engine, which featured four cylinders for the first time in a car, in 1894, when staying at Stuttgart&#x27;s former Hermann Hotel.

DMG seemed a reliable enterprise, so Jellinek decided to start selling its cars. In 1898, he wrote to DMG requesting six more cars and to become a DMG main agent and distributor. In 1899, he sold 10 cars and 29 in 1900. Among French car-makers such as Peugeot, Panhard &amp; Levassor and other makers licensed to sell Daimler-engined vehicles in France there was a shortage of cars, and Jellinek benefited by being able to beat other suppliers&#x27; lengthy waiting-times.

Jellinek kept contacting DMG&#x27;s designers with his ideas, some were good, but often with harangues, such as &quot;Your manure wagon has just broken down on schedule&quot;; &quot;Your car is the chrysalis and I want the butterfly&quot;; and &quot;Your engineers should be locked up in an insane asylum.&quot; This annoyed Daimler, but Maybach took notice of many of his suggestions.

Every year in March, the French Riviera celebrated a speed-week, attracting many members of the local high-society. The events included:
* &quot;Nice-Castellane 90k&quot; (90 km long-distance race)
* &quot;Magagnosc&quot; (touring race)
* &quot;Promenade des Anglais&quot; (sprint race)
* &quot;Nice-La Turbie&quot; (hill-climb race)
* &quot;Monte Carlo&quot; (&quot;concours d&#x27;elegance&quot;)

In 1899. Jellinek entered his cars in all of them. As the usage of pseudonyms was common, he called his race-team Mercedes and this was visibly written on the cars&#x27; chassis. &quot;Monsieur Mercedes&quot; became his personal alias and he became well known by it in the region.

Using the DMG-Phoenix, Jellinek easily won all the races, reaching , but he was still not satisfied with the car.

==The Mercedes 35hp (1900)==
In 1899 DMG commissioned some engineers including Wilhelm Bauer, Wilhelm Werner and Hermann Braun, to investigate the possibility of using the Phoenix for sporting events as at that time car racing was the best way of generating publicity in Europe.

On March 30, 1900, Wilhelm Bauer decided spontaneously to enter the &quot;Nice-La Turbie&quot; hill climb but crashed fatally after hitting a rock on the first turn while avoiding spectators. This caused DMG to abandon racing.

Nonetheless, Jellinek came to an agreement with DMG on April 2, 1900, by promising the large sum of 550,000 Goldmark if Wilhelm Maybach would design a revolutionary sports car for him, to be called the &quot;Mercedes&quot; great right, of which 36 units had to be delivered before October 15. The deal also included an order for 36 standard DMG 8 hp cars. Jellinek also became a member of DMG&#x27;s Board of Management and obtained the exclusive dealership for the new &quot;Mercedes&quot; for France, Austria, Hungary, Belgium and United States of America. Jellinek had some legal problems over the use of the Daimler name in France with Panhard Levassor who owned the Daimler licences for France, and the use of the Mercedes name put an end to that problem.

Apparently Jellinek laid down a strict specification for the &quot;Mercedes&quot; stating &quot;I don&#x27;t want a car for today or tomorrow, it will be the car of the day after tomorrow&quot;. He itemized many new parameters to overcome the problems found in many of the ill-designed &quot;horseless carriages&quot; of the time which made them unsuitable for high speeds and at risk of overturning:
* Long wheelbase and wide track to provide stability.
* Engine to be better located on the car&#x27;s chassis.
* Lower center of gravity.
* Electric ignition using the new &quot;Bosch&quot; system (in lieu of a gas heated glow tube).

The model would be officially called the &quot;Daimler-Mercedes&quot; which the DMG chairman accepted readily as it overcame the problem of the Daimler name in France being owned by Panhard &amp; Levassor.

Over the next few months, Jellinek oversaw the development of the new car at first by daily telegrams and later by traveling to Stuttgart. He took delivery of the first one on December 22, 1900, at Nice&#x27;s railway station – it had already been sold to the Baron Henri de Rothschild who had also raced cars in Nice.

In 1901, the car amazed the automobile world. Jellinek again won the Nice races, easily beating his opponents in all the capacity classes and reaching . The director of the French Automobile Club, Paul Meyan, stated: &quot;We have entered the Mercedes era&quot;, a sentiment echoed by newspapers worldwide.

The records set by the new Mercedes amazed the entire automobile world. DMG&#x27;s sales shot up, filling its Stuttgart plant to full capacity and consolidating its future as a car making company. The number of employees steadily increased from 340 in 1900 to 2,200 in 1904. In 1902, on June 23, the company decided to use the &quot;Mercedes&quot; name as the trademark for its entire automobile production and officially registered it on September 26.

==Life after the Mercedes success (1900 to 1914)==

As well as shaving off his side-whiskers, the overjoyed Emil Jellinek, in Vienna in June 1903 at the age of 50, changed his name to &quot;Jellinek-Mercedes&quot;, commenting: &quot;This is probably the first time that a father has taken his daughter&#x27;s name&quot;. From then on, he signed himself &quot;E.J. Mercédès&quot;.

Jellinek and his enthusiastic associates were distributing DMG-Mercedes models worldwide, six hundred were sold by 1909, making millions for DMG. He supplied cars to all 150 members of Nice&#x27;s Automobile Club and also supported racing teams all over Europe. His life was absorbed by the business, spending much time away from home, and sending many telegrams.

As the 1900s continued, his passion for the Mercedes began to fade. He tired of the special requests being made by his highly demanding aristocratic customers. He also became disillusioned by DMG&#x27;s technical department which he called &quot;those donkeys&quot; and built his own large repair facilities at Nice behind &quot;Villa Mercedes&quot;. Wilhelm Maybach, his favorite designer, left DMG in 1907. He also so angered DMG&#x27;s chairman that in 1908 he permanently cancelled Jellinek&#x27;s original contract.

His diplomatic career continued and he was Austro-Hungarian Consulate General in successively Nice (1907), Mexico and Monaco. In 1909 when in Monte Carlo, Jellinek finally severed his commercial activities to concentrate on his consular work but did purchase some casinos in the region.

==First World War, his last years (1914 to 1918)==
Just before war broke out in 1914 the Austrian government charged Jellinek for taxes on his French properties. The family then moved to Semmering, Austria. While being treated at a sanatorium in Bad Kissingen by Dr. Von Dapper, he ceded the Baden mansion to his family, writing: &quot;(The Baden Villa) disturbs me terribly, I cannot sleep and that is detrimental to my health!&quot;

When Austria-Hungary entered war on July 28, 1914, Jellinek and his family stopped speaking French outside their property. Later that year, they moved to Meran (France) but there, he was accused of espionage for Germany, supposedly hiding saboteurs in his Mediterranean yachts. At the same time, the Austrians suspected his wife, Anaise.

Fleeing in 1917, they ended up in Geneva, in neutral Switzerland, where Emil Jellinek was temporarily arrested again. He stayed there until his death on January 21, 1918, at the age of 64. All his French properties were later forfeited. Since 1982, his remains have rested near Rachel&#x27;s tomb, in Nice&#x27;s Catholic Cemetery.

A decade after his death, in 1926, amid the German post-war crisis, DMG merged with Benz to become the Daimler-Benz company with their automobiles called &quot;Mercedes-Benz&quot;. Daimler-Benz purchased Chrysler in 1998 and became DaimlerChrysler until August 2007, when Chrysler was sold off to Cerberus Capital Management. The company is now known as the Mercedes-Benz Group.

==Jellinek-Mercedes&#x27;s properties==
In the Mercedes global boom in 1900, Jellinek-Mercedes purchased several properties including:
* Mercedes exhibition room in the Champs-Élysées, Paris.
* Grand hotels: &quot;Royal&quot; and &quot;Scribe&quot; in Nice and the &quot;Astoria&quot;, in Paris.

His most important properties were:
* &quot;Villa Mercedes&quot; in Nice. No. 57, &quot;Promenade des Anglais.&quot;
* &quot;Villa Mercedes II&quot; in Nice. No. 54, &quot;Promenade des Anglais&quot;. Bought in 1902.
* &quot;Villa Jellinek-Mercedes&quot;, &quot;Wienerstrasse&quot; 39–45, in Baden (next to the original vineyard house). Purchasing it as a building plot in 1891, Jellinek built a large mansion, adding to it progressively from 1909 until it had 50 rooms, 8 bathrooms and 23 toilets. During the battle of Berlin in 1945 the villa was destroyed and only the garage as well as two rooms were left.

<doc id="738703" wikidata="Q3121821" url="?curid=738703" title="Guy Hain">
<text>Guy Hain is a French art forger who produced number of fake bronze sculptures.

Guy Hain began as a seller of veterinary products. In his job he met a number of veterinarians who had antique bronze sculptures of animals and developed an interest in them. In 1962 he spent 550,000.00 French francs for Rodin&#x27;s &quot;The Kiss&quot;. When he could not find a job as a salesman, he became an art dealer. He opened a gallery &quot;Aux ducs de Bourgogne&quot; in the Louvre des Antiquaires - a shopping mall not far from the Louvre that is leased mostly by antiques dealers . He closed the gallery in 1988.

Hain approached the foundry of Rudier that was one of the foundries that had produced Rodin&#x27;s bronze sculptures at the beginning of the 20th century. He convinced the owners Georges and Bernard Rudier to use the original molds to recast known Rodin works. He set up a chasing shop in Nogent-sur-Marne and in 1990 bought the Balland foundry in Luxeuil-les-Bains and managed them with his wife.

Since the bronzes were based on the original moulds, the experts could not see the difference. Some of the bronzes were also made based on production plaster copies used 75–90 years previously.

Hain sold thousands of new bronzes to art dealers as originals, using the signature of Alexis Rudier, the original caster for Rodin. He earned equivalent to FFR 130 million ($18.2 million). He later claimed that he had a contract to use the name of Alexis but the Rudiers contested that.

He expanded to the production of copies from other sculptors like Antoine-Louis Barye, Alfred Barye, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, Camille Claudel, Christophe Fratin, Emmanuel Frémiet, Aristide Maillol, Pierre-Jules Mene and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. He practically flooded the art market with his copies.

In January 1992, police inspectors from Dijon, in Burgundy, arrested Hain and seized about twenty metric tons of bronze sculptures in various foundries in Burgundy and Paris.

On 17 January 1996 Hain appeared in court in Lure, central France, accused of forgery. On 28 June 1997 he was sentenced to four years in jail but served only 18 months.

The auctioneers &quot;Rey et Faure&quot; of Rambouillet were also charged with complicity for selling the bronzes of Hain in their auctions between 1987 and 1991. They had sold copies worth about $3 million. A big would-be-Rodin bronze called &quot;The Kiss&quot; was sold for Fr4.5 million (about US$800,000). Charges were later dropped.

Other auction houses such as Christie&#x27;s and Sotheby&#x27;s had also sold copies by Hain to their customers.

On 27 January 2006 a public auction organized by DNID (Direction Nationale d&#x27;Interventions Domaniales) was held in Dijon, France, with 73 bronzes in the exhibition. Five pieces were removed from the sale and 68 remained.
&quot;Angélique et Roger montés sur l&#x27;hippogriffe&quot;, &quot;after&quot; Antoine Barye, unmounted, sandcast bronze sculpture without inscription was adjudged €54,000.
An original piece was sold for a record price of $310,000.00 at Christie&#x27;s on 25 April 2003.

When Hain was released, he continued the practice: he had the bronzes produced in stages, one foundry doing the casting, one the chasing and one the patination. In 2000 he registered the names of Alexis and Georges Rudier - along with a number of other foundries - as trademarks he was wishing to be allowed to use. However, Georges Rudier sued him to get the names back.

Hain was rearrested in 2002 and appeared in court in April. Evidence collected by the Dijon police department included some 1,100 copies of the works of 98 different French sculptors. The prosecutor asked for five years in prison and a fine of two million Francs.

Many art dealers and collectors became very suspect of bronze works. Art expert Gilles Perrault calculated that Hain had produced over 6,000 copies beyond those the police had found and confiscated. Only one-third of the copies had been traced.

<text>The Assam Rifles (AR) is a Paramilitary force of India responsible for border security, counter-insurgency, and maintaining law and order in Northeast India and in Jammu &amp; Kashmir in lines of Rashtriya Rifles. Its primary duty involves guarding the Indo-Myanmar border. The AR is one of the Oldest Central Para-military Forces of India administered by the Ministry of Home Affairs while operational control rests with Indian Army. As a central paramilitary force, its recruitment, perks, promotions, and retirement policies are governed by Assam Rifles Regulations. Approximately 80 percent of the officers are deputed from the Army, while the remaining are drawn from the AR cadre. The AR is commanded by the Director General of the Assam Rifles (DG AR), appointed by the Ministry of Home Affairs.

The AR is often nicknamed &quot;Sentinels of the North East&quot; and &quot;Friends of the Hill People&quot;. It is the oldest paramilitary force in India, originally raised in 1835 as Cachar Levy, a militia to protect tea gardens and the fertile plains of Assam against unruly tribes. Its scope increased with the expansion of British Raj in Northeast India, and it was used against insurgencies in the region. The force was redesignated as Assam Frontier Police in 1883, Assam Military Police in 1891, and East Bengal and Assam Military Police in 1913. It got its present name in 1917. After independence, the AR functioned under the Ministry of External Affairs. Its operational control was transferred to the Indian Army after the Sino-Indian War of 1962. It came under the administration of Ministry of Home Affairs in 1965, with the Army retaining operational control.

Throughout its history, the Assam Rifles have served in various conflicts and theaters, including World War I by serving in Europe and the Middle East, and World War II, where they served mainly in Burma. After the Chinese annexation of Tibet, the AR were tasked with manning Assam&#x27;s section of the Tibetan border. They were also instrumental in maintaining law and order in Arunachal Pradesh.

As of the 2019–2020 report of the Ministry of Home Affairs, there are 46 battalions in the Assam Rifles with a sanctioned strength of 65,143 personnel. They perform many roles including upholding internal security under the control of the army through the conduct of counterinsurgency and border security operations, provision of aid to civilians in times of emergency, and the facilitation of communications, medical assistance and education in remote areas. In times of war they can also be used as a combat force to secure rear areas if needed. Since 2002, the force has had the role of guarding the India–Myanmar border.

The present day Assam Rifles can trace its origins to a paramilitary force known as &quot;Cachar Levy&quot; which was established by the British in 1835 in the Assam region. The Assam Rifles boasts of being the oldest paramilitary force. With approximately seven hundred and fifty men, this force was formed as a police unit to protect settlements against tribal raids and other assaults as British rule slowly moved towards the north east parts of India.

Despite problems with equipment and training, the contribution of this force in opening the region to administration and commerce was nevertheless quite significant and over time they have become known as the &quot;right arm of the civil and [the] left arm of the military&quot; in the region. In 1870 these existing elements were merged into three Assam Military Police battalions which were spread out in the Lushai Hills (later 1st battalion), Lakhimpur (2nd battalion) and Naga Hills (3rd battalion). A fourth battalion was later formed Imphal in 1915. Following India&#x27;s independence, Col. Sidhiman Rai, MC, was appointed the first Indian DG of Assam Rifles.

Since then the name of the force has undergone a number of changes, as have the roles that it has been required to perform.

=== World War I and Interwar years ===
During World War I, men from what was then known as the &quot;Assam Military Police&quot; were part of the Indian forces that fought in Europe and the Middle East. Over three thousand men from the force were provided to the Gorkha regiments of the Indian Army in this time, earning seventy-six gallantry awards during the conflict including seven Indian Order of Merit awards and five Indian Distinguished Service Medals. These men performed with such distinction that the name &quot;Assam Rifles&quot; was assigned in 1917 as recognition of their part in the war. Elements of the force were also utilised in India during the war, being used to maintain internal security in order to free up troops from the army for use overseas. During this time, the most notable action occurred in 1917 when columns of the Assam Rifles were despatched to Patna, to restore law and order in the riot-torn city.

After the war the force returned to northern India where they were used to maintain security amidst growing civil unrest and disorder. In concert with the British Indian Army, they also undertook a number of expeditions into remote tribal areas along the north-east frontier and into Burma. In 1924 they were sent to Malabar, which was then still part of the Madras Presidency, to carry out operations against the Mopla rebels.

=== World War II ===
During World War II, the role of the Assam Rifles evolved once more as they were called upon to undertake even more varied tasks due to their status as both a police and military organisation. This time, however, their service would be undertaken closer to home. After the lightning Japanese advance in 1942, the Assam Rifles fought a number of Independent actions behind enemy lines as the task of rear-area defence and rear-guard often fell to them during the Allies retreat into India. Later, as a large influx of refugees fled from the advancing Japanese into India, the Assam Rifles were given the task of managing and organising this mass of humanity.

They also organized a resistance group on the Indo–Burmese border to counter the Japanese invasion and to harass the enemy line of communications. This group became known as &quot;Victor Force&quot; (or sometimes V-Force), and the nucleus of it was formed from platoons made up of men from the Assam Rifles. As part of this force, Assam Rifles platoons were used as covering forces during the latter stages of the Burma Campaign. Other elements fought in the defensive &quot;boxes&quot; around Kohima, whilst another, from the 4th Battalion, trained as airborne troops, was dropped near the Sittang River behind Japanese lines. The 1st Battalion, as part of Lushai Brigade was sent ahead of the rest of the force to provide resistance in the Chin Hills. As a testament to the performance of Assam Rifles men during the war, members of the unit received forty-eight gallantry awards. These included: three MBE&#x27;s, five Military Crosses, 4 Orders of British India, one Indian Order of Merit, 13 Military Medals, 15 Indian Distinguished Service Medals and 7 British Empire Medals.
=== Postwar period ===
Following the end of the war the five Assam Rifles battalions became part of the civil police under the Assam Inspector General of Police. After independence, however, the Indian government assigned the Assam Rifles its own Director General, who is sent on tenure based postings from the Indian Army. As the numbers of the force and the number of battalions gradually increased, the rank of the force commander was upgraded to Director General, which is occupied by a lieutenant general ranking officer in the Indian Army. The present Director General of the Assam Rifles is vikas Lakhera

Prior to 1965, this force was under the Ministry of External Affairs, who were looking after NEFA affairs. Later, it was transferred to the Ministry of Home Affairs, with Indian Army retaining operational control. From a nominal complement of only five battalions in 1947, it has grown to 46 with several range HQs. 3 training center, and a number of logistics units function under the HQ DGAR, Shillong. The Assam Rifles Public School is a much sought after education institute in the North East.

The role of the Assam Rifles continued to evolve when in 1950 a devastating earthquake hit the Assam region and the force was called in to assist in the reconstruction of the areas and help in the resettlement and rehabilitation of those affected by it. Later the force was once again called to undertake a combat role when, during the 1962 Sino-Indian War elements were used to delay the advancing Chinese forces so that the Indian Army could establish its defence lines. During this time and since then, the Assam Rifles also maintained their peacekeeping role in the northern areas of India in the face of growing tribal unrest and insurgency. In this environment the maintenance of law and order, countering insurgency and reassuring the people of the region became important tasks for the security forces and initially they fell to the Assam Rifles before the Army assumed control, and then later their experience and goodwill in the region was drawn upon in order to assist the army in conducting these tasks. In recognition of the unit&#x27;s skill in counterinsurgency operations, three battalions were deployed on Operation Pawan in Sri Lanka between December 1988 and February 1990.

Through its deployment in what has become known as the &quot;tribal belt&quot;, the Assam Rifles have developed an ethos that is based primarily upon the notion of extending the hand of friendship with the people of the region despite the troubles that have occurred there. This has resulted in their employment in a number of developmental activities in the region as they have worked to bring order and security to it. As such, their role has been further expanded to include the provision of medical assistance and basic education, assisting in reconstruction and agriculture and handling communications in remote areas.

From a force of 5 battalions in 1947, the Assam Rifles has grown substantially over the years. In 1960 there were 17 battalions, in 1968 there were 21 and today there are 46 battalions. In addition, the force has several area HQs, a training centre that processes up to 1,800 recruits at time, and a number of logistics units.

<text>Bernard &quot;Bernie&quot; Cornfeld (17 August 1927 – 27 February 1995) was a prominent businessman and international financier who sold investments in US mutual funds, and who was tried and acquitted for mismanagement of the Investors Overseas Services (IOS).

==Early life==
Bernard Cornfeld was born in Istanbul, in Turkey. His father was a Romanian-Jewish actor; his mother was from a Russian-Jewish family. They moved to the United States when Bernard was four years old; his father died two years later. The young Brooklyn-raised Cornfeld worked after school each day in fruit stores and as a delivery boy. He had a stammer as well as a natural gift for selling and when a schoolfriend&#x27;s father died, the two of them used the US$3,000 insurance money to purchase and run an age and weight guessing stand at the Coney Island funfair. He graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School and Brooklyn College.

He initially worked as a social worker, but then switched to selling mutual funds for an investment house.

==Investors Overseas Services==
In the 1960s, Cornfeld formed his own mutual fund sales company, Investors Overseas Services (IOS), with principal offices in Geneva, Switzerland, although it was incorporated in Panama. Although the executive headquarters were in Geneva, the main operational offices of IOS were in Ferney-Voltaire, France, across the French border from Geneva. During this period, Diane von Furstenberg worked for Cornfeld as a receptionist.

Cornfeld decided that mutual funds should take their fees from the profits they made for their investors, not just a percentage of the money invested.

The IOS system collapsed in 1970. Cornfeld was arrested in Switzerland in 1973 and sentenced to 11 months in preventive prison; however, he was ultimately acquitted in 1979. Having kept part of his earnings, he was able to maintain a luxurious (albeit less ostentatious) lifestyle until he died in 1995.

==Other business ventures==
Following his acquittal, Cornfeld settled in Beverly Hills, California, where he ingratiated himself to film industry circles. For a period of time until 1992, he lived in the Grayhall mansion, built in 1909 and at one time leased by Douglas Fairbanks. Cornfeld numbered among his friends Elizabeth Taylor, Michelle Phillips, Warren Beatty, Laurence Harvey, Victor Lownes, Hugh Hefner, Richard Harris, Al Capp, Tony Curtis, Howard Sackler, John Heyman and Simon Reuben. 

In 1972, Cornfeld bankrolled the Paradise Ballroom, partnering with New York showman Jerry Brandt. The club, an attempt by Brandt to re-create his New York disco, &quot;The Electric Circus&quot; in Los Angeles was a failure, and Cornfeld closed the business.

Grayhall mansion doubled as the home of rock star John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson) in the 1976 version of &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; starring Barbra Streisand. At the age of 60, Cornfeld had an affair with the then 19-year-old Heidi Fleiss.

By the 1990s, Cornfeld had developed an obsession for health foods and vitamins, renounced red meat and seldom drank alcohol. In his last years he was a chairman of a land development firm in Arizona and also owned a real estate company in Los Angeles.

==Death==
Bernard Cornfeld suffered a stroke and died of MRSA on 27 February 1995 in London, England. He was tended to by his 17 year old daughter, Jessica.

<doc id="738718" wikidata="Q504109" url="?curid=738718" title="Józef Boruwłaski">
<text>Józef Boruwłaski (November 1739–September 5, 1837) was a Polish-born dwarf who was employed by the court and who was also a musician who toured in European and Turkish courts.

==Early life==
Józef Boruwłaski was born near Halicz in Ukraine in November 1739. His parents seem to have been impoverished gentry, but it is impossible that Józef had any real claim to the title of &#x27;Count&#x27; as there were no similar Polish aristocratic titles. This may relate to the practice of giving show dwarfs military titles, such as General Tom Thumb. Two of his five siblings were also short, but he did have a brother who grew to be in height, and died in battle as a soldier. Given the proportions of his body, and the fact that in adulthood he was sometimes mistaken for a small child, it is likely that Józef was a pituitary dwarf, not a dwarf of the achondroplasic variety. Ms. , the Starostin of Kahorlik took a shine to the short boy and adopted him. After her marriage her acquaintance the Countess Humiecka took charge of Boruwłaski and took him to her estate at in Podolia. The Countess was able to persuade the Starostin to give up her little companion by reminding the Starostin of the old superstition that a woman who sees a dwarf during pregnancy may give birth to a dwarf.

==European tour==
When Boruwłaski was fifteen and 64 cm (25 inches) tall, the countess took him to Vienna, where he was presented to Empress Maria Theresa, a lady Józef described as the &#x27;Queen of Hungary&#x27; in his autobiography. Well-mannered Boruwłaski apparently impressed one of the empress&#x27;s children so much that she gave him a diamond ring. The story that this child was the young Marie Antoinette (then called Maria Antonia) does not fit the dates – Boruwłaski may have become confused because all the daughters of the empress had the first name &#x27;Maria&#x27;.

Later the countess took him to Lunéville to see the ex-king of Poland, Stanisław Leszczyński. There he aroused the jealousy of Nicolas Ferry, the court dwarf of the Leszczyński household, who was nicknamed Bébé. On one occasion Ferry attacked Boruwłaski and tried to throw him into the fire; Leszczyński separated them and had Ferry whipped.

Next, in 1760, the countess took Boruwłaski to Paris, where he frequented the court in various masked balls and pageants. He also developed a habit of drinking nothing but water, apparently keeping himself fit in this way. He was reported to have reached 71 cm (28 inches) in height at 22 years of age.

The next stop was The Hague where he reportedly impressed the court ladies. On their road to Warsaw through Germany, Boruwłaski became enamored of an actress in a company of French comedians. His feelings were not reciprocated.

==Stanisław II of Poland==
When Stanisław II acceded to the throne of Poland, he took Boruwłaski under his protection. When Boruwłaski fell in love with the new companion of the countess, Isalina Barbutan, the countess threw him out. The King interceded on his behalf, giving him a small allowance and a coach to travel in, and, with the royal backing, he married Isalina. At first, Isalina, the child of a French couple who had settled in Poland, was reluctant to marry Józef, but he bombarded her with love-letters and won her heart.

At the age of 25, Boruwłaski stood 89 cm (35 inches tall), and five years later, measured 99 cm (39 inches), which was to be his final height, although his friend the comedian Charles Mathews believed that he continued to grow into old age.

==A further tour==
He decided to take a new tour and left Warsaw November 1780 with his wife and royal letters of introduction. In Kraków Isalina gave birth to a daughter and they reached Vienna in February 1781. In Vienna he was introduced to British ambassador Robert Murray Keith who invited him to England. Meanwhile, Boruwłaski gave concerts in Vienna, playing his own compositions. Józef was a good violinist and guitarist, and was able to dance while playing the guitar, even when he was quite old.

From Vienna they toured in Germany, Turkey and to the north. When they eventually decided to depart for England, their ship almost sank in a storm before it reached Margate. In London, Boruwłaski obtained the patronage of the Duke of Devonshire and of his famous wife Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire. Józef was even presented to the future King George IV and eventually to the rest of the royal family. George IV presented him with two different watches, one of which was given when George was still Prince of Wales. Józef used the title Comte (Count) Boruwłaski and organized subscription concerts. He also met the Irish giant Patrick Cotter and the famously overweight Daniel Lambert.

In 1783–1786 he toured in Scotland and Ireland. Hearing rumours that Józef was earning good money from his music, the King of Poland withdrew his allowance. Boruwłaski returned briefly to Poland for a while but soon returned and by July 1791 was touring again and in 1795 was again in Ireland. English appearances at this time included York in 1785 and 1789, and Leeds and Beverley in the early 1790s.

==Money problems==
Although he was sometimes able to make a reasonable living from his music, the problems and expenses of touring sometimes wore Boruwłaski down. His wife seems to have been a poor traveller, and often pleaded illness and stayed at home. Money problems forced Józef to display himself for money (which he found deeply humiliating) and to bring out three different editions of his autobiography, the last published at Durham in 1820.

==Retirement in Durham==
Eventually, in his advancing years, Boruwłaski accepted an offer to live in Durham, from Thomas Ebdon, organist of Durham Cathedral. Boruwłaski lived in Banks Cottage, Durham with the unmarried daughters of Thomas Ebdon, and purchased an annuity for his retirement years. The annuity had been bought from a local grocer who, Józef claimed in his autobiography, had thought that a dwarf like Józef would not live much longer.

Since Józef&#x27;s friend Ebdon was a freemason, it may have been through him that on 7 October 1806, Boruwłaski was made an honorary member of the Durham &quot;Granby&quot; lodge.

Józef was also close friends with another important resident of Durham, the actor Stephen Kemble of the famous Kemble family.

In Durham Boruwłaski also became a passionate angler, becoming the first Polish person to describe the artificial fly technique.

==Death and memorials==
Józef Boruwłaski died in Durham, on September 5, 1837, at the age of 97. Józef was buried in Durham Cathedral, as was his friend in life Stephen Kemble. Whilst the grave of Kemble (which is in the Chapel of the Nine Altars) has a large stone slab with an inscription, the last resting place of Józef Boruwłaski is marked simply with the initials J.B. on a flagstone. It can be found on the floor in the north west nave of the cathedral, under the RAF Memorial Window. 

There is a life-size statue of him in the Durham Town Hall, together with a small display of his personal effects, including a suit, hat, cane, chair and violin. The Town Hall also has a large oil painting of Józef as an old man. A tetrastyle Greek temple, restored in 2007, stands on the banks of the River Wear at Durham: this is called the &#x27;Count&#x27;s House&#x27; and its position suggests that it may have been an ornamental folly in the Count&#x27;s garden. There is a collection of documents relating to the man Durham people called &#x27;the Little Count&#x27; at the Palace Green library of Durham University.

<text>Carl Herrmann Unthan (5 April 1848 – 19 November 1929) was a Prussian-born violinist who was born without arms.

==Biography ==
He was born on 5 April 1848 in Sommerfeld, East Prussia.

Unthan&#x27;s father was a teacher who insisted he not be &quot;coddled&quot;. Whether this was the reason or not, Carl reportedly could feed himself at two and around the age of ten is said to have taught himself to play the violin by strapping it on to a stool. He was sent to a music conservatory at 16 and graduated a couple of years later.

By the age of twenty Unthan was performing to full concert halls. He would go on to perform notably in Vienna with classical orchestras. He began with personal concerts and later added additional tricks to his repertoire. During his maiden performance he broke a string; he replaced it and tuned the new string using only his toes. After this it is said he would deliberately weaken one string before each performance so that it would snap during his recital, giving him an opportunity to repeat his dexterity. He was also a marksman who could shoot the spots out of a playing card with a rifle operated by his feet. He toured Cuba, Mexico, South America, and Europe. Later he married Antonie Neschta, with whom he had toured for a time. He moved to the United States and eventually gained citizenship.

During World War I, Unthan served in the German army by being sent to hospitals where he lectured soldiers who had lost their arms or hands, and spoke about how they could train their legs and feet to take over. 

At the age of 65, Unthan (credited as &quot;Charles Unthan&quot;) appeared in the Danish silent film &quot;Atlantis&quot; which includes a passenger liner sinking during a voyage. The author of the original story, Gerhart Hauptmann, had been impressed by Unthan during a cross-Atlantic voyage and was inspired to write the character of Arthur Stoss, an armless virtuoso, based upon him. Hauptmann&#x27;s contract with the Danish filmmakers stipulated that only Unthan could play the character.

His memoirs were published as &quot;The Armless Fiddler&quot;. He died in November 1929 in Berlin, Germany at the age of 81.

==Autobiography ==
In 1925, Unthan published his autobiography, &quot;Das Pediskript. Aufzeichnungen aus dem Leben eines Armlosen&quot; (&quot;The pediscript. Notes from the life of an armless man&quot;) in Germany, using &quot;pediscript&quot; rather than &quot;manuscript&quot; because he had typed it with his feet, pedally, as opposed to manually. It was published in English translation in 1935, six years after his death, as &quot;The Armless Fiddler, A Pediscript: Being the Life Story of a Vaudeville Man&quot;, the term &quot;vaudeville&quot; referencing Unthan&#x27;s experience as a stage performer.

==Popular culture ==
There is an oblique reference to Unthan in the dialogue of Charles Chaplin&#x27;s film &quot;Limelight&quot;, which takes place in the early twentieth century while Unthan was still performing.

Peter Sloterdijk, in his book &quot;You Must Change Your Life&quot;, discusses Unthan&#x27;s commitment to what he terms an &quot;ethics of the Nonetheless&quot;, which places him &quot;undoubtedly&quot; in &quot;the earlier defiance-existentialist movement&quot; of Germans such as Max Stirner in order to &quot;...demonstrate the unusual convergence of human and cripple in the discourses of the generation after Nietzsche&quot;.

<text>Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 was the chartered flight of a Fairchild FH-227D from Montevideo, Uruguay, to Santiago, Chile, that crashed in the Andes mountains in Argentina on 13 October 1972. The accident and subsequent survival became known as the Andes flight disaster (, literally Tragedy of the Andes) and the Miracle of the Andes ().

The inexperienced co-pilot, Lieutenant-Colonel Dante Héctor Lagurara, was piloting the aircraft at the time of the accident. He mistakenly believed the aircraft had overflown Curicó, the turning point to fly north, and began descending towards what he thought was Pudahuel Airport in Santiago de Chile. He failed to notice that instrument readings indicated he was still east of Curicó. Lagurara, upon regaining visual flight conditions, saw the mountain and unsuccessfully tried to gain altitude. The aircraft struck a mountain ridge, shearing off both wings and the tail cone. The remaining portion of the fuselage slid down a glacier at an estimated , descending before ramming into an ice and snow mound.

The flight was carrying 45 passengers and crew, including 19 members of the Old Christians Club rugby union team, along with their families, supporters and friends. Three crew members and nine passengers died immediately and several more died soon after due to the frigid temperatures and the severity of their injuries. The crash site is located at an elevation of in the remote Andes mountains of western Argentina, just east of the border with Chile. Search and rescue aircraft overflew the crash site several times during the following days, but failed to see the white fuselage against the snow. Search efforts were called off after eight days of searching.

During the 72 days following the crash, the survivors suffered from extreme hardships, including sub-zero temperatures, exposure, starvation, and an avalanche, which led to the deaths of 13 more passengers. The remaining passengers resorted to eating the flesh of those who died in order to survive. From 19 team members on the flight, seven of the rugby players survived the ordeal; 11 players and the team physician perished.

Convinced they would die if they did not seek help, two survivors, Nando Parrado and Roberto Canessa, set out across the mountains on 12 December. Using only materials found in the aircraft wreck, they climbed for three days from the crash site up 30-to-60 degree slopes to a ridge to the west of the summit of Mount Seler. From there they trekked for seven more days into Chile before finding help. On 22 and 23 December 1972, two-and-a-half months after the crash, the remaining 14 survivors were rescued. Their survival made worldwide news.

==Flight and accident==

===Flight origin===

Members of the amateur Old Christians Club rugby union team from Montevideo, Uruguay, were scheduled to play a match in Santiago, Chile, against the Old Boys Club, an English rugby team. Club president Daniel Juan chartered a Uruguayan Air Force twin turboprop Fairchild FH-227D airplane to fly the team over the Andes mountains to Santiago. The aircraft carried 40 passengers and 5 crew members. The pilot in command, Colonel Julio César Ferradas, was an experienced Air Force pilot with 5,117 hours of flight time. He was accompanied by co-pilot Lieutenant-Colonel Dante Héctor Lagurara. There were ten extra seats, so the team invited friends and family members to accompany them. When someone cancelled at the last minute, Graziela Mariani purchased a ticket so she could attend her oldest daughter&#x27;s wedding.

The aircraft departed Carrasco International Airport on 12 October 1972, but a storm front over the Andes forced them to spend the night in Mendoza, Argentina, to wait for meteorological conditions to improve. Although there is a direct westerly route from Mendoza to Santiago, the high mountains including Mount Aconcagua at were near the FH-227D&#x27;s service ceiling of . With the aircraft loaded to capacity, this direct route would have required the pilot to fly very carefully to avoid the mountains. Instead, it was customary for turboprops to fly the longer , 90-minute U-shaped route to Malargüe south of Mendoza using the A7 airway (now UW44), then west along the G-17 airway (now UB684), crossing Planchón pass and on to the Curicó radiobeacon in Chile, and from there due north to descend and land in Santiago.

The weather on 13 October affected the flight adversely. On the morning of the flight meteorological conditions over the Andes had yet to improve, but the weather was expected to improve by the early afternoon. The pilot delayed the flight and took off from Mendoza at 2:18p.m. on Friday 13 October. He flew south towards the Malargüe radiobeacon at flight level 180 (). Lagurara radioed their position to Malargüe Airport to inform them that they expected to cross the high Planchón pass at 3:21p.m. Planchón pass is the air traffic control hand-off point between Chile and Argentina. After crossing the Andes into Chile the aircraft was supposed to turn north and initiate their descent into Pudahuel Airport in Santiago.

===The crash===

Pilot Ferradas had previously flown across the Andes 29 times. On this flight he was training co-pilot Lagurara, who was at the controls. As they flew above the Andes, clouds obscured the mountains below. The aircraft was four years old with 792 hours on the airframe. 

The plane was nicknamed the &quot;lead sled&quot; by pilots because they considered it underpowered. The fuselage of this aircraft and others had been stretched to add a 1.83 m (6 ft) section, increasing passenger capacity from 52 to 56, and making room for more cargo between the cockpit and the passenger cabin. A total of 78 FH-227 aircraft were built, 23 of which eventually crashed. The 1972 Andes flight disaster was the tenth FH-227 crash since the model was introduced in 1966.

Due to cloud cover the pilots were flying under instrument meteorological conditions at an altitude of at FL180 through the high Planchón pass and could not visually confirm their location from the terrain below.

At 3:21p.m., shortly after crossing Planchón pass, Lagurara notified air traffic controllers that he expected to reach Curicó a minute later. While some reports state the co-pilot incorrectly estimated his position using dead reckoning, he was relying on radio navigation. For unknown reasons, he did not see the aircraft&#x27;s VOR/DME navigation radio displaying the bearing and distance to the Curicó radio beacon, still due west of Planchón pass.

The flight time from Planchón pass to Curicó is normally 11 minutes, but only three minutes later the co-pilot radioed Santiago that they were overflying Curicó and turning due north. He requested permission from air traffic control to descend. The controller authorized the aircraft to descend to , unaware due to lack of radar coverage that the airplane was still flying over the Andes. Pilot Ferradas also failed to notice the navigation error.

The aircraft encountered severe turbulence as it descended. Nando Parrado recalled that the plane rapidly descended several hundred feet out of the clouds. At first the rugby players joked about the turbulence until they saw the aircraft was flying abnormally close to the mountains. &quot;That was probably the moment when the pilots saw the black ridge rising dead ahead.&quot;

Roberto Canessa later said he thought the pilot had turned due north too soon and began the descent to Santiago while the aircraft was still flying over the Andes. Then &quot;he began to climb, until the plane was nearly vertical and it began to stall and shake.&quot; The aircraft&#x27;s ground collision alarm sounded and scared all the passengers.

The pilots applied maximum power to gain altitude and climb over the high southern ridge of the glacier&#x27;s cirque. Witness accounts and evidence at the scene indicated the plane struck the mountain two or three times.

The co-pilot was able to bring the aircraft nose over the ridge, but at 3:34p.m., the lower part of the tail-cone may have clipped the ridge at . The next collision severed the right wing. Some evidence indicates it was thrown back with such force that it may have been the event that tore off the tail-cone. When the tail-cone was sheared off, it took with it the rear part of the aircraft, including two rows of seats, the galley, baggage hold, vertical stabilizer and horizontal stabilizer, leaving a gaping hole in the rear. Three passengers, the navigator and the flight attendant were lost with the tail section.

The aircraft&#x27;s momentum and its remaining engine carried it forward and upward until a rock outcropping at tore off the left wing. Its propeller sliced through the fuselage. Two more passengers fell out of the gaping hole in the rear. The fuselage crashed onto the snow and careened down the steep slope of the glacier at , rammed into a snow bank and came to a sudden stop. The seats broke loose from the floor and were thrown against the forward bulkhead of the fuselage. The impact crushed the cockpit, pinning both pilots against the instrument panel, killing Ferradas immediately.

The official investigation concluded that the crash was caused by controlled flight into terrain due to pilot error.

The plane&#x27;s fuselage came to rest in the cirque of the &quot;Glaciar de las Lágrimas&quot; or &quot;Glacier of Tears&quot; at at an elevation of , in the Malargüe Department in the Mendoza Province of Argentina. The glacier lies between the high Mount Sosneado and the high Tinguiririca volcano, straddling the remote mountainous border between Chile and Argentina. It is south of a high mountain (later named Mount Seler by Nando Parrado in honor of his father). Two survivors later climbed the peak before descending into Chile to get help. The aircraft came to rest to the east of its planned route.

==Crash aftermath==

Of the 45 people aboard the aircraft, three passengers and two crew members in the rear section of the fuselage died when the tail cone was ripped from the fuselage: Lt. Ramón Saúl Martínez (navigator), Ovidio Ramírez (steward), Gaston Costemalle, Alexis Hounié and Guido Magri. A few seconds later Daniel Shaw and Carlos Valeta also fell out of the rear fuselage, killing Shaw. Valeta survived the fall but fell into deep snow and asphyxiated while stumbling down the snow-covered glacier. His body was found by fellow passengers on 14 December.

When the fuselage slammed into the snow bank, the remaining seats broke loose from the floor, compressing the passengers against the forward bulkheads. Team physician Dr. Francisco Nicola, his wife Esther Nicola, Eugenia Parrado, and Fernando Vazquez were killed. Pilot Ferradas died instantly when the nose gear compressed the instrument panel against his chest and forced his head out of the windshield. Co-pilot Lagurara was critically injured and trapped in the crushed cockpit. He asked one of the passengers to find his pistol and shoot him, but the passengers refused. He died the following day.

Thirty-three passengers and crew survived the first day, although many were critically or seriously injured. Their wounds included broken legs resulting from the impact of the seats against the forward bulkhead. Both of Arturo Nogueira&#x27;s legs were broken in several places. None of the passengers with compound fractures survived. Canessa and Gustavo Zerbino, both medical students, quickly triaged the wounded and first treated those they could help most. Nando Parrado had a skull fracture and he remained unconscious for three days, and his sister, Susana, was badly injured and semi-conscious. Graziela Mariani&#x27;s legs were broken and trapped by twisted seats. Enrique Platero had a piece of metal stuck in his abdomen that when removed brought a few inches of intestine with it. He nonetheless immediately began helping others.

===Unsuccessful air search===

The Chilean Air Search and Rescue Service (SARS) was notified within the hour that the flight was unaccounted for. Four aircraft began to search for the aircraft based on its last reported position on the Curicó corridor from Angostura to Santiago. News of the missing flight reached Uruguayan media around 6:00p.m. that evening. When SARS officials could not locate the crash, they listened to recordings of the radio transmissions and concluded the aircraft must have crashed in one of the most remote and inaccessible areas of the Andes. They asked the Andes Rescue Group of Chile (CSA) for assistance. Unbeknownst to the passengers or the search teams, the flight had crashed in Argentina even before crossing into Chile, about from the Hotel Termas el Sosneado, an abandoned hot springs resort.

On the second day, eleven aircraft from Argentina, Chile and Uruguay searched for the missing flight. The search area covered the accident location and a few aircraft even overflew the crash site. The survivors tried to use lipstick recovered from their luggage to write an SOS message on the roof of the fuselage, but did not have enough lipstick to make large letters that could be seen from the air by rescuers. They also used luggage to fashion a cross on the snow, but it failed to attract the attention of the rescuers. The survivors saw aircraft overfly the crash site on three occasions but the rescuers were unable to spot the white fuselage against the snow.

The harsh conditions gave the rescuers little hope that they would find anyone alive so rescue efforts were cancelled after eight days of searching. On 21 October, after having searched for more than 142 hours, the searchers concluded the chances of anyone surviving the crash were nil and terminated the search. They planned to resume the search to recover the victims in December after the snow melted.

===First week of survival===

Another five passengers and crew died between the first night and next day: co-pilot Lagurara, Francisco Abal, Graziela Mariani, Felipe Maquirriain and Julio Martinez-Lamas.

The remaining 28 survivors removed the broken seats and other debris to fashion the fuselage into a crude shelter small. They used luggage, seats and snow to close off the rear end of the fuselage. Fito Strauch devised a solar-powered water collector with sheet metal he retrieved from under the seats. To prevent snow blindness, he also improvised sunglasses by cutting the green plastic sun visors in the cockpit and sewing the pieces to bra straps with electrical wire. They used the woolen seat covers to keep warm and seat cushions as snowshoes. The captain of the rugby team, Marcelo Perez, took on a leadership role.

After three days Parrado regained consciousness only to learn that his mother had died and his 19-year-old sister Susana was severely injured. He tried to keep his sister alive but on the ninth day she too died from her injuries. The remaining 27 survivors had a hard time during the nights when temperatures plunged to . They all had lived their entire lives by the sea and some had never even seen snow before the crash. None had any high-elevation survival training or experience. They lacked medical supplies, cold-weather clothing, equipment, and food. They only had three pairs of sunglasses among themselves to prevent snow-blindness.

They found a small AM transistor radio jammed between two aircraft seats. Roy Harley improvised a long antenna using electrical wire from the plane and on the eleventh day on the mountain heard the news that their search had been called-off. Piers Paul Read&#x27;s book &quot;&quot; describes how they reacted:

=== Resorting to cannibalism ===

The survivors had very little food to eat. They found eight chocolate bars, three small jars of jam, a tin of mussels, a tin of almonds, a few dates, some candy, dried plums, and several bottles of wine. They rationed the meager supply of food but it lasted only a week. Parrado ate a single chocolate-covered peanut over three days. Far above the timber line, there was no vegetation or animals. When the food ran out, they ate the cotton stuffing from the seats and leather from belts and shoes, which made them sick.

Knowing that rescue efforts had been called off and facing certain death from starvation, the survivors gave each other permission to use their bodies for food in case they died. Left with no alternative, the survivors consumed the bodies of their deceased friends and relatives. Canessa later described the decision to eat the dead:

The group survived by eating the bodies of their dead comrades. This decision was not taken lightly, as most of the dead were classmates, close friends or relatives. Canessa cut the meat with a shard of broken windshield glass. He set the example by swallowing the first matchstick-sized lump of human flesh. Several others followed suit over the next few days, but a few still kept refusing to eat it.

In his memoir, &quot;Miracle in the Andes: 72 Days on the Mountain and My Long Trek Home&quot; (2006), Parrado wrote about this decision:

Parrado protected the bodies of his mother and sister so they would not be eaten. They dried the meat from the bodies in the sun to make it easier to eat. At first they were so disgusted by the experience that they could only eat skin, muscle and fat, but in the end they also ate hearts, lungs, and even brains.

All of the passengers were Roman Catholic. Some feared eating human flesh would lead to eternal damnation. According to Read, some survivors compared it to the Eucharist, i.e. the conversion of bread and wine into the Body and the Blood of Jesus Christ. Others cited John 15:13 from the Bible to justify it: &#x27;No man hath greater love than this: That he lay down his life for his friends.&#x27;

All who survived the ordeal made the decision to eat human flesh, though not without serious reservations. Some, including Coche Inciarte and Numa Turcatti, only ate the bare minimum necessary for survival, due to their deep revulsion. Javier Methol and his wife Liliana, the only surviving female passenger at the time, were the last to eat human flesh. Liliana had very strong religious convictions against doing so and only reluctantly agreed to eat after someone suggested that doing so was akin to receiving the Holy Communion.

===Avalanche===

Close to midnight on 29 October and sixteen days after the crash, an avalanche struck the fuselage while the survivors were asleep, almost completely filling the fuselage with snow and ice and smothering eight people to death: Enrique Platero, Liliana Methol, Gustavo Nicolich, Daniel Maspons, Juan Menendez, Diego Storm, Carlos Roque and Marcelo Perez. The death of Perez, rugby team captain and leader of the survivors, along with the loss of Liliana Methol, who had nursed many injured passengers &quot;like a mother and a saint&quot;, were particularly difficult to bear for the remaining survivors.

The avalanche completely buried the fuselage filling it to within of the ceiling. The survivors trapped inside quickly realized they would soon run out of air. Parrado took a metal pole from the luggage racks and used it to pry open one of the cockpit windscreens and to poke a hole through the snow for fresh air. On the morning of 31 October they were able to dig an exit tunnel with considerable difficulty from the cockpit to the surface, only to be faced with a blizzard that made them crawl back into the fuselage.

The blizzard raged furiously for three days trapping the survivors together with the bodies of the deceased inside the snow-filled fuselage. On the third day they began to eat the flesh of their newly deceased friends. Parrado later said: &quot;It was soft and greasy, streaked with blood and bits of wet cartilage. I gagged hard when I placed it in my mouth.&quot;

With Perez dead, Daniel Fernández and cousins Eduardo and Fito Strauch assumed the leadership of the group. They took over harvesting the flesh from the deceased and distributing it for others to eat.

Before the avalanche a few survivors insisted the only way to survive would be to climb over the mountains to get help. Because the co-pilot kept repeating before he died that the aircraft had overflown Curicó, the survivors believed the Chilean countryside was closest at only a few kilometres to the west. Unbeknownst to them, they had crashed deep in the Andes mountain range and the Chilean countryside was a distant to the west. As the days passed, with the onset of summer the temperature rose and the snow that had buried the fuselage began to melt away.

===Exploring the area surrounding the crash site===

In the first few weeks after the crash, some survivors set out on brief expeditions to explore the immediate vicinity of the aircraft but they found that altitude sickness, dehydration, snow blindness, malnourishment and the extreme night-time cold made it impossible to travel any significant distance from the crash site.

The decision was made for a few survivors to leave on an expedition to get help. Some survivors were determined to join the expedition team, including Canessa (one of the two medical students) but other survivors were less willing to do so or were unsure of their ability to stand up to such a physically demanding ordeal. Numa Turcatti and Antonio Vizintín were selected to accompany Canessa and Parrado, however Turcatti&#x27;s wounded leg had become infected so he was unable to join the expedition. Canessa, Parrado and Vizintín were among the most physically fit and were allocated larger rations of meat to build their strength for the expedition and the warmest clothes to withstand the night-time cold they would have to face on the mountain. They were also excused from carrying out the daily tasks essential to the group&#x27;s survival so they could focus on training for the upcoming ordeal. At Canessa&#x27;s urging, they waited the better part of a week for temperatures to increase.

The expedition aimed to head west to Chile but the large mountain on the western rim of the glacier&#x27;s cirque presented a formidable obstacle so instead the team of three decided to head east. They hoped the valley would make a U-turn to the west that would lead them to Chile. On 15 November after several hours of walking downhill east of the fuselage, they found the tail section of the aircraft with the galley mostly intact. They also found luggage with a box of chocolates, three meat patties, a bottle of rum, bottles of Coca-Cola, cigarettes, extra clothes, comic books, some medicine and, most importantly, the aircraft&#x27;s batteries. They decided to seek shelter for the night inside the tail section, started a fire to stay warm, and stayed up late reading comic books.

The next morning they continued descending to the east, but on the second night of the expedition they nearly froze to death. They decided to return to the tail section and bring the batteries to the fuselage. They hoped they could power the radio and make an SOS call to Santiago for help.

===Radio inoperative===

Upon returning to the tail, the trio found that the batteries were far too heavy to carry back to the fuselage, an uphill climb in the deep snow from the tail section. Instead they decided it would be better to return to the fuselage, disconnect the radio, and bring it back to the tail section where the batteries were. Roy Harley used his knowledge as an amateur electronics enthusiast to assist in the process. Unbeknownst to them, the aircraft&#x27;s avionics required 115 Volt AC power while the battery from the tail section only supplied 24 Volt DC, thus dooming their plan from the start.

They gave up after several days of not being able to make the radio work and returned to the fuselage realizing they would have to climb out of the mountains on their own terms to get help if they were to have any chance of surviving. Along the way they were struck by another blizzard. Harley lost faith and stopped, expecting to die, but Parrado helped him back to the fuselage.

===Last three deaths===

Arturo Nogueira died on 15 November and three days later, Rafael Echavarren also died, both from their infected wounds. Numa Turcatti, whose extreme revulsion against eating human flesh dramatically accelerated his physical decline, died on day 60 (11 December) weighing only 25 kg (55 pounds). He was the last victim of the crash. The remaining survivors knew they would all die if they did not leave soon to get help. The survivors heard on the transistor radio that the Uruguayan Air Force had resumed searching for them.

==Expedition to Chile to get help==

===Making a sleeping bag===

The remaining survivors came to the realization that the only way out was to climb over the mountains on the western rim of the glacier&#x27;s cirque, and that such a climb was impossible unless they found a way to survive the freezing night-time temperatures they would find at elevation. They fashioned a sleeping bag with insulation from the rear of the fuselage, electrical wire and the waterproof fabric that covered the plane&#x27;s air conditioning unit. Parrado described in his book, &quot;Miracle in the Andes: 72 Days on the Mountain and My Long Trek Home&quot;, how they came up with the idea of making a sleeping bag:

Turcatti died after the sleeping bag was completed. Canessa was still hesitant about the trip. While the remaining survivors encouraged Parrado to go on the expedition, no one actually volunteered to go with him. Parrado finally persuaded Canessa it was time to set out and together with Vizintín, the three men began climbing the mountain on 12 December.

===Climbing the western peak===

Based on the aircraft&#x27;s broken altimeter, they thought they were at , when they were actually at . They also believed, based on the co-pilot&#x27;s dying words, that they had overflown Curicó, near the western edge of the Andes. They thought the closest help lay due west. As a result, they only brought along a three-day supply of meat for the three of them. Parrado wore three pairs of jeans, three sweaters over a polo shirt and four pairs of socks wrapped in a plastic shopping bag.

They had no rock climbing gear, no area map, no compass and no climbing experience. On 12 December 1972, Parrado, Canessa and Vizintín began climbing out of the glacier at an elevation of . Instead of climbing the somewhat lower ridge to the south, they headed straight up the steep 30-60º headwall slope of the mountain ridge. They thought they could climb the ridge top in a day. Parrado took the lead with the other two often asking him to slow down. The thin oxygen-poor air made climbing difficult. During certain sections of the climb, they sank up to their hips in the summer-softened snow. 

The improvised sleeping bag they shared kept them alive through the nights. In the documentary film &quot;&quot;, Canessa described how on the first night they had difficulty finding level ground to place the sleeping bag on. A blizzard blew fiercely and they finally found a rocky ledge at the edge of a cliff level enough for the sleeping bag. Canessa said it was the worst night of his life. The climb was slow and tedious. The survivors at the base camp watched them climb for three long days.

===Reaching the ridge top===

On the third morning after starting out, Canessa stayed back at the camp site. Vizintín and Parrado reached the base of a nearly vertical 100-metre (330 ft) wall. The wall was covered with snow and ice. Parrado used a stick he brought along to carve steps in the ice wall. He reached the ridge before Vizintín. Believing he would see the green valleys of Chile to the west, he was stunned when he was faced with seemingly unending snow-capped mountain peaks extending in every direction. Vizintín and Parrado descended and rejoined Canessa as the sun set. They sipped cognac from a bottle they had found in the tail section of the aircraft and Parrado said: &quot;Roberto, can you imagine how beautiful this would be if we were not walking dead?&quot;

They realized their rescue-seeking expedition was going to take much longer than they had anticipated. They decided that Vizintín should return to base camp so the other two might have enough food to complete their journey. Vizintín&#x27;s return was entirely downhill and he used an aircraft seat as a makeshift sleigh to make it back down to base camp within the hour.

From their bivouac spot the night before, Parrado and Canessa took three hours to climb to the ridge. When they reached the top and only saw snow-capped mountains in every direction, Canessa thought, &quot;We&#x27;re dead!&quot;. Parrado told Canessa, &quot;We may be walking to our deaths, but I would rather walk to meet my death than wait for it to come to me.&quot; Canessa agreed: &quot;You and I are friends, Nando. We have been through so much. Now let&#x27;s go die together.&quot; Parrado saw two lower peaks near the western horizon that were clear of snow, with the valley at the foot of their mountain slowly winding its way towards those peaks. Parrado was sure the valley was the way out of the mountains and refused to give up hope. They followed the ridge towards the valley for a considerable distance as they descended.

===Finding help===

Parrado and Canessa hiked down for seven more days into Chile. They reached the narrow valley that Parrado had seen from the top of the mountain, where they found the source of Río San José, leading to Río Portillo, which meets Río Azufre at Los Maitenes. They continued descending along the river and reached the snowline. Gradually they started seeing ever more signs of human life: first, an empty soup can, and finally, on the ninth day, some cows.

Canessa was exhausted and unable to keep walking so they rested for the evening. As they gathered wood for a fire, they saw three men on horseback on the other side of the river. Parrado called out to them but the noise of the river made it impossible to communicate. One of the men across the river saw Parrado and Canessa and shouted back: &quot;Tomorrow!&quot; The next day the man returned, scribbled a note, tied the note with a pencil to a stone and threw the stone across the river to Parrado. Parrado replied:

, a Chilean &quot;arriero&quot;, read the note and made signs that he understood. One of the &quot;arrieros&quot; remembered that several weeks ago an acquaintance had asked if they had heard about the airplane that crashed in the Andes. The &quot;arrieros&quot; could not imagine that anyone would still be alive. Catalán threw a loaf of bread to the two men across the river and rode due west for ten hours to get help.

During the trip Catalán ran into another &quot;arriero&quot; on the south bank of the Azufre river and asked him to ride towards the survivors and take them to the Los Maitenes village. Catalán then followed the river to its junction with the Tinguiririca river, crossed a bridge and followed the narrow route to the holiday resort of Termas del Flaco. There he hailed a truck that took him to the police station at the village of Puente Negro where the police relayed news of the survivors to the Chilean Army 19th Infantry Regiment &quot;Colchagua&quot; in San Fernando, who in turn contacted Army headquarters in Santiago.

In the meantime Parrado and Canessa arrived on horseback at Los Maitenes where they were fed and allowed to rest. Canessa had lost half of his body weight since the plane crash and weighed .

The men had climbed the from the crash site to the western ridge of the glacier&#x27;s cirque at . After crossing the ridge, they descended over ten days, traveling .

===Helicopter rescue===

When the news broke out that survivors had emerged from the crash of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571, the story of their 72-day ordeal drew international attention. A flood of international reporters hiked several kilometers from Puente Negro to Termas del Flaco. The reporters clamored to interview Parrado and Canessa about the crash and their survival.

The Chilean Air Force provided three Bell UH-1 helicopters to assist with the rescue. They flew in heavy cloud cover under instrument conditions to Los Maitenes, where the Army interviewed Parrado and Canessa. Once the fog lifted at noon, Parrado guided the helicopters to the crash site in Argentina with the pilot&#x27;s map he had brought with him. One of the helicopters remained behind as backup. The pilots were astounded at the difficult terrain the two men had crossed to get help.

The two helicopters arrived at the crash site on the afternoon of 22 December 1972. The steep terrain only permitted the pilot to touch down with a single skid. Due to the altitude and weight limits, the two helicopters were able to take only half of the survivors. Four of the rescuers volunteered to stay behind with the remaining eight survivors for their last night on the mountain. The second flight of helicopters arrived the following morning at daybreak. The last remaining survivors were rescued on 23 December 1972, more than two and a half months after the crash. The survivors were taken to hospitals in Santiago for evaluation and were treated for altitude sickness, dehydration, frostbite, broken bones, scurvy and malnutrition.

Normally the search and rescue team would have also recovered the remains of the dead for burial. However, because recovery would have had to be made from Argentine soil, the Chilean rescuers decided to leave the bodies behind until Argentine authorities decided how to proceed. The Chilean military photographed the bodies and mapped the crash site before returning to Chile.

===Shorter route===

On December 13, their second day climbing the mountain, Canessa thought he saw a line along the valley to the east, and believed it to be a road. He tried to persuade Parrado to head in that direction, but Parrado thought the idea was crazy and would not consider it. Based on the information they had, believing the plane had already crossed the border into Chile, they chose to go west. They later learned that the road Canessa had seen to the east of the crash site might have allowed them to reach a lower altitude sooner. 

However, according to Juan Ulloa, an Argentinian guide who hiked Canessa and Parrado&#x27;s route multiple times, they ultimately made the right choice despite the longer distance. Ulloa speculates that both men would have died had they pivoted east, due to the increased number of obstacles, which included abysses.

† &quot;Survivor since deceased&quot;

==Aftermath==

The survivors told the press they had managed to stay alive eating cheese and other food items they had brought with them, and after these ran out, local vegetation. They planned to discuss the actual details of how they survived, including the decision to eat the flesh of those who died, first only with their families. False rumors circulated in Montevideo saying they had killed some of the survivors for food. On 23 December, news reports of cannibalism were published worldwide, except in Uruguay. On 26 December, two pictures taken by members of Cuerpo de Socorro Andino (Andean Relief Corps) of a half-eaten human leg were printed on the front page of two Chilean newspapers, &quot;El Mercurio&quot; and &quot;La Tercera de la Hora&quot;, who reported that the survivors had resorted to eating the flesh of those who died in order to survive.

The survivors held a press conference on 28 December at the Stella Maris College in Montevideo to tell the story of their 72-day ordeal. Alfredo Delgado acted as the spokesman for the survivors. He compared their actions to that of Jesus at the Last Supper, during which he gave his disciples the Eucharist. The survivors initially faced a backlash of public opinion, but after they explained the pact the survivors had made among themselves to sacrifice their flesh in case of death to help the others survive, the outcry subsided and their families became more understanding. A Roman Catholic priest heard the survivors&#x27; confessions and reassured them they were not going to be damned for it, given the &quot;&quot; nature of their survival situation. The news of their survival, and what they were forced to resort to, drew world-wide attention and developed into a media circus. Pope Paul VI sent a telegram to the survivors sanctioning the consumption.

=== Burial of the remains at the crash site ===
The Argentine authorities and the victims&#x27; families decided to bury the remains of the victims at the crash site in a common grave. Thirteen bodies were whole while another 15 consisted only of skeletal remains. Twelve men and a Chilean priest were taken to the crash site on 18 January 1973. Family members were not allowed to attend. They dug a grave from the aircraft fuselage at a location they deemed protected from avalanches. They built a simple stone altar near the grave and placed an orange iron cross on its top. They also made a memorial out of a pile of rocks they gathered and placed a plaque on it with the inscription:

They doused the remains of aircraft wreckage with gasoline and set it on fire. Eduardo Strauch later wrote in his book &quot;Out of the Silence&quot; that the bottom half of the fuselage, covered in snow and thus spared by the fire, was still there when he returned in 1995.

Ricardo Echavarren, the father of one of the victims, received word from a survivor that his son had wished to be buried at home. Unable to obtain official permission from Argentine authorities to retrieve his son&#x27;s body, Echavarren hired guides and mounted an illegal expedition of his own. He had arranged with the priest who had buried his son to mark the body bag with his son&#x27;s remains. Upon returning to the abandoned Hotel Termas El Sosneado, he was arrested for grave robbery. A federal judge and the local mayor interceded to secure his release and Echavarren was later authorized to make funeral arrangements for his son.

==Legacy==

The survivors&#x27; courage under life-threatening conditions has been described as &quot;a beacon of hope to [their] generation, showing what can be accomplished with persistence and determination in the face of unsurpassable odds when we set our minds to attain a common goal&quot;. The story of the crash is described in the Andes Museum 1972, dedicated in 2013 in Ciudad Vieja, Montevideo.

In 1973 the mothers of 11 of the victims who died in the crash founded the Our Children Library in Uruguay to promote reading and teaching. Family members of victims of the doomed flight founded Fundación Viven in 2006 to preserve the legacy of the flight, the memory of the victims and to support organ donation.

In 2007 while being interviewed on Chilean television, &quot;arriero&quot; Sergio Catalán revealed he had arthrosis of the hip. Canessa (who had become a doctor) and other survivors raised money to pay for his hip replacement surgery. Catalán died in 2020 at the age of 91. Canessa also co-authored a 2016 book titled &quot;I Had to Survive: How a Plane Crash in the Andes Inspired My Calling to Save Lives&quot;.

The perseverance of the crash survivors has also been analyzed in a case study by German researchers. Accounts from the survivors illustrated how the human interactions of project members can build resilience in the face of adversity.

=== Site tours ===

The crash site attracts hundreds of visitors from all over the world each year. Several tour companies offer excursions to the site that pay tribute to the victims and survivors and how they managed to survive. The trip to the site takes three or four days. Four-wheel drive vehicles take visitors from the village of El Sosneado in Mendoza to Puesto Araya near the abandoned Hotel Termas el Sosneado. From there, travelers either continue on horseback or walk for three days to reach the crash site. They spend their first night in the Valley of Tears at the El Barroso camp site. On the third day, they reach the Las Lágrimas glacier and the crash site.

=== Monument ===

In March 2006, the families of the victims of the crash built a black obelisk monument at the crash site to memorialize those who lived and died there.

<doc id="738739" wikidata="Q3568869" url="?curid=738739" title="William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle">
<text>William Parker, 13th Baron Morley, 4th Baron Monteagle (15751 July 1622), was an English peer, best known for his role in the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot. In 1605 Parker was due to attend the opening of Parliament. He was a member of the House of Lords as Lord Monteagle, the title on his mother&#x27;s side. He received a letter; it appears that someone, presumably a fellow Catholic, was afraid he would be blown up. The so-called Monteagle letter survives in the National Archives (SP 14/216/2), but its origin remains mysterious.

==Early life==
William was the eldest son of Edward Parker, 12th Baron Morley (died 1618), and of Elizabeth Stanley, daughter and heiress of William Stanley, 3rd Baron Monteagle (died 1581). He had both a younger brother, Charles, and a younger sister, Mary.

William&#x27;s father was a recusant, but appears to have been in favour at court; he was one of the noblemen who tried Mary, Queen of Scots. However, William was allied with many Roman Catholic families, and during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I was in sympathy with their cause. His wife, the daughter of Sir Thomas Tresham, came from a well-known Roman Catholic family. His sister married Thomas Habington, also a Roman Catholic. He was knighted while with Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, in Ireland in 1599, and in 1601 he took part in the latter&#x27;s rebellion in London. He was punished by imprisonment in the Tower and indicted but made a direct appeal to Cecil to intercede on his behalf with the Queen, which was successful and he was subsequently released and &quot;reserved for her Majesty&#x27;s use&quot; after paying a fine of £4,000 (according to Cecil&#x27;s private papers) or a fine of £8,000. Being &quot;reserved&quot; meant he was not forgiven of his involvement, as some others were, but essentially on parole as were Robert Catesby and Francis Tresham. Also, whilst he was committed to the Tower and wrote to Cecil under the name Lord Monteagle, he was fined under the name Sir William Parker, suggesting he may have been stripped of his right to sit in the Lords as a result of his treason and lost some of his land in Essex, although these were restored when King James pardoned actions prior to his reign.

Having close ties with the extremist Catholic faction during Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s rule, and a hand in organising Thomas Winter&#x27;s mission to Spain in 1602, William Parker later declared to be &quot;done with all formal plots&quot; after King James I took the throne. Monteagle even went as far as writing a letter to his new king with a promise to follow the state religion. Like some reformers, Monteagle blamed his childhood for his previous wrongdoings, stating: &quot;I knew no better.&quot; This letter does not have a date and the tone of the letter suggests someone who has enjoyed a longer period of friendship with the King which prompted his conversion referring as it does to &quot;Your majesty’s tender and fatherly love over me in admonishing me heartofore, to seek resolution In matter of religion&quot;. It would also seem that he was specifically rejecting the Papacy and becoming an Anglo-Catholic, like the Earl of Northampton, rather than wholly adopting the Protestant faith, which would then make his subsequent actions with respect to the Catholic community more understandable.

==Gunpowder Plot==

===Background===
When King James I began his reign, English Catholics had hoped that the persecution felt for over 45 years under his predecessor Queen Elizabeth would finally end. Though more tolerant than others before him, James was still faced with plots and schemes by priests and rebels trying to end the mistreatment of Catholics through force (Fraser 63). To please the Protestants, who were distressed over the growing strength of the Catholic religion, James proclaimed his detestation of Catholics in England. Once again priests were expelled, fines were taxed, and Catholics went back to living a hidden life, but some Catholics were not so accepting of the secretive nature in which they had to practise their faith.

In 1604 Robert Catesby, a devout Catholic with a magnetic personality, recruited friends and rebels to meet and discuss his plot to blow up the House of Lords in an attempt to reestablish Catholicism in England. Those present at that first meeting with Catesby were Thomas Wintour, John Wright, Thomas Percy and Guy Fawkes. With the imminent threat of plague, Parliament postponed re-opening until 5 November 1605, which gave the plotters ample time to lease out a small house in the centre of London where Fawkes would live under the alias &quot;John Johnson&quot; as Thomas Percy&#x27;s servant while gathering the gunpowder necessary (Fraser 174). By March 1605, the 36 barrels of gunpowder were moved to the newly leased out cellar directly under the House of Lords.

On 26 October an anonymous letter warned Lord Monteagle to avoid the opening of Parliament. This letter was possibly sent by Monteagle&#x27;s brother-in-law, Francis Tresham. In any event, it caused enough suspicion that on the night of 4 November the undercroft beneath the House of Lords was searched by guards, where Guy Fawkes was found in possession of matches and gunpowder was found hidden under coal. After intense torture in the Tower of London Fawkes gave his true name and those of his fellow conspirators. All but one of the plotters pleaded not guilty but nevertheless the seven were found guilty of high treason and each was executed on 30 and 31 January.

===The Monteagle letter===
On 26 October 1605, while sitting at supper at his house in Hoxton, London, he received a letter warning of the Gunpowder Plot.

It is believed by some historians that he wrote the letter himself to win acclaim and favour with the King. The historians in question are likely biased against him having Catholic sympathies or actually being a later 19th century Jesuit historian. Fraser posits that the note was from someone who wanted to protect Monteagle (either his family, such as his sister Mary Habington, or a friendly conspirator). Had it been a conspirator, such as Francis Tresham, the writer would also have intended to end the plot before it began; Monteagle had been too clear in his politics to assume he would remain quiet about the plot. The argument against Mary Habington having sent the letter is that the letter was too clumsy, and that there were far better ways to discreetly deliver the information, had it come from her. As for a conspirator, Monteagle benefited too richly—and the conspirators too terribly—for that to be the case. Initially Thomas Wintour&#x27;s confession suggested that Monteagle had sent warning to him, Catesby and Tresham about the letter and that he was taking it to Cecil. His name was removed from the official account, leaving just an anonymous person giving the warning, and yet the contemporary Jesuit account of the plot suggested it was his servant who brought them the warning, without saying he was authorised to do so by Monteagle. It seems somewhat suspicious that the author of the Jesuit account knew of this information when it had never been made public and the plotters were very careful not to talk to anyone outside their own circle prior to the discovery and even tried to maintain ignorance of the gunpowder element initially after their arrest. According to the Jesuit history they received two more warnings on Saturday, 2 November (that the King had taken the letter very seriously) and Sunday, 3 November (that it was being handled with great secrecy), yet they still didn&#x27;t abandon their scheme and flee to the Continent as suggested. The Jesuit history also imparts the information that when Thomas Wintour told this to Francis Tresham on the Sunday, he seemed to be &quot;a man who had lost control of himself&quot; and insisted &quot;without a doubt, the plot was discovered&quot;. This would suggest that probably the letter was something devised by Monteagle after receiving a verbal warning from Tresham, without necessarily knowing what the word &quot;blow&quot; really meant, and was trying very hard both to prevent the carnage (thinking it was a warning of a violent insurrection) and save his former friends from the consequences of their own infamy. He knew Catesby and Wintour well enough to deduce that if a rebellion was planned, they were likely part of it or may be he got Tresham to admit as much to him.

After deciphering the letter, Monteagle rushed to Whitehall and showed it to Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, who then showed it to the King. On 4 November, Monteagle joined Thomas Howard in searching the basement of Parliament, where they found the stash of gunpowder and explosives. For his service in protecting the crown, Monteagle was rewarded with 500 pounds and 200 pounds&#x27; worth of lands.

Several other Catholic members of Parliament were absent on the planned day of the attack but Monteagle was the only member of Parliament who was confirmed to have received a letter warning of the plot.

==Later life and death==
In 1609, Parker invested in the second Virginia Company and became a member of the council. He had shares in the East India and North West Companies as well. Parker used his influence to protect his brother-in-law, Thomas Habington, from the possible consequence of death, after harbouring the forbidden priests at Hindlip. Although Habington was condemned, his wife&#x27;s pleas to her brother secured his reprieve. Despite revealing the Gunpowder Plot, Parker seems to have retained some connections to the Catholic community. His eldest son of six children, Henry Lord Morley, was also a known Catholic and in 1609, he was suspected of sheltering students from St. Omer&#x27;s seminary. Monteagle gave permission for his eldest daughter Frances Parker to become a nun, although not willing, at first, to grant her request. He eventually surrendered to his physically handicapped daughter&#x27;s appeal &quot;in respect that she was crooked, and therefore not fit for the world.&quot;

By his marriage with Elizabeth Tresham, daughter of Sir Thomas Tresham, he had six children: three sons and three daughters. The eldest son, Henry, succeeded him as 14th Baron Morley and 5th Baron Monteagle. These baronies fell into abeyance when Henry&#x27;s son Thomas died in about 1686. His eldest daughter, Frances, was a nun; the second, Catherine, married John Savage, 2nd Earl Rivers; and the youngest, Elizabeth, married Edward Cranfield, and was the mother of Edward Cranfield. Through Catherine, he was the 5× great-grandfather of Alfred, Lord Tennyson.

Parker was summoned to parliament as Baron Morley and Baron Monteagle in 1618 after the death of his father. He died on 1 July 1622 at Great Hallingbury in Essex and was reported to have received the last rites of the Roman Catholic Church before his death.

<text>San Carlos de Bariloche (from the Mapuche name &quot;Vuriloche&quot;, meaning &quot;people from the other side of the mountain&quot;), commonly known simply as Bariloche (), is the largest city in the Argentine province of Río Negro and the seat of the department of the same name. It is located in the foothills of the Patagonian Andes on the southern shore of Nahuel Huapi Lake, near the border with Chile. With a population of 135,755 according to the 2022 census, Bariloche is a mid-sized city by national standards but holds significant regional importance, being not only the most populous city in its province but also the largest in the Patagonian Andes, and the third largest in the entire Argentine Patagonia following Neuquén and Comodoro Rivadavia. Its urban zone is characterized by its low density and has an area of more than , extending longitudinally from east to west for about . 

Bariloche&#x27;s economy is heavily centered on tourism, making it the country&#x27;s third most visited destination after Buenos Aires and Mar del Plata, as well as the most popular destination in all of Patagonia. It attracts visitors year-round for its scenic natural setting including Nahuel Huapi National Park and other reserves, offering a range of activities such as skiing in winter and water sports and hiking in summer, alongside diverse accommodations and dining options. The nearby Cerro Catedral is the largest ski resort in South America. The city is a traditional hub for student tourism in Argentina, hosting the customary high school graduation trips, as well as 15th birthday celebrations from neighboring countries. In 2012, a law passed by the Argentine Congress declared Bariloche the &quot;National Capital of Adventure Tourism&quot;. In addition to tourism, scientific activities are also of growing importance for the city, as it hosts the National Atomic Energy Commission&#x27;s Bariloche Atomic Centre, as well as the public universities of Comahue, Río Negro and the National Technological.
==History==
The name &quot;Bariloche&quot; comes from the Mapudungun word &quot;Vuriloche&quot; meaning &quot;people from behind the mountain&quot; ( = behind, = people). The Poya people used the Vuriloche pass to cross the Andes, keeping it secret from the Spanish priests for a long time.

There is evidence of the existence of indigenous settlements on banks of Lake Nahuel Huapi, in the area now occupied by the city of Bariloche, prior to arrival of expeditionaries and white settlers. During the Neolithic, the arrival of human beings to Nahuel Huapi region occurs. The archaeological and historical record speaks of tehuelches and puelches presence in the area. With the process of araucanization and mainly since the 17th century, the culture of these groups is strongly affected by Mapuches, who increased their presence from the settlement of Spaniards in Chile, and their continued push east.

At 19th century end, in the vicinity of Nahuel Huapi, only a few scattered indigenous families were there: People of Inacayal had been stripped of their lands, and transferred to Tecka (Chubut) when the cacique was taken prisoner. Curruhinca had made an act of submission to Argentine government with his own. Some Nguillatun was still being celebrated.

But the region was beginning a new stage in its history. Although incorporated into national sovereignty, the Nahuel Huapi area began to develop fundamentally linked to Chile. Before 19th century end, when the border was still in dispute, people from the south of the neighboring country were gradually arriving to settle in surroundings of the lake. Small farmers were most of them from the island of Chiloe, but German immigrants living in Chile also arrived.

===Spanish explorations and missions===

Nahuel Huapi lake was known to Spaniards since the times of the Conquest of Chile. Following the trails of the Mapuche people across the Andes, in the summer of 1552–1553, the Spanish Governor of the Captaincy of Chile Pedro de Valdivia sent Francisco de Villagra to explore the area east of the Andes at the latitudes of the city of Valdivia. Francisco de Villagra crossed the Andes through Mamuil Malal Pass and headed south until reaching Limay River in the vicinity of Nahuel Huapi Lake.

Another early Spaniard to visit the zone of Nahuel Huapi Lake was the Jesuit priest Diego de Rosales. He had been ordered to the area by the Governor of Chile Antonio de Acuña Cabrera, who was concerned about the unrest of the native Puelche and Poya after the slave-hunting expeditions carried out by Luis Ponce de León in 1649, who captured Indians and sold them into slavery. Diego de Rosales started his journey at the ruins of Villarica in Chile, crossed the Andes through Mamuil Malal Pass, and traveled further south along the eastern Andean valleys, reaching Nahuel Huapi Lake in 1650.

In 1670, Jesuit priest Nicolás Mascardi, based in Chiloé Archipelago, entered the area through the Reloncaví Estuary and Todos los Santos Lake to found a mission at the Nahuel Huapi Lake, which lasted until 1673. A new mission at the shores of Nahuel Huapi Lake was established in 1703, backed financially from Potosí, thanks to orders from the viceroy of Peru. Historians disagree if the mission belonged to the jurisdiction of Valdivia or Chiloé. According to historic documents, the Poya of Nahuelhuapi requested the mission to be reestablished, apparently to forge an alliance with the Spaniards against the Puelche. Following the 1712 Huilliche rebellion in Chiloé Archipelago some insurgents sought refuge with Father Manuel del Hoyo in the mission.

The mission was destroyed in 1717 by Poyas following a disagreement with the missionaries; the superior of the mission had refused to give them a cow. Soon thereafter authorities learned that four or five people travelling to Concepción had been killed by the Poya. The colonists assembled a punitive expedition in Calbuco and Chiloé. Composed of both Spaniards and indios reyunos, the expedition did not find any Poya.

In 1766 the head of the Mission of Ralún tried to reestablish the mission at Nahuel Huapi, but the following year, the Crown suppressed the Society of Jesus, ordering them out of the colonies in the Americas.

=== 19th century to 1895 ===

The area had stronger connections to Chile than to the distant city of Buenos Aires during most of the 19th century, but the explorations of Francisco Moreno and the Argentine campaigns of the Conquest of the Desert established the legitimacy of the Argentine government. It thought the area was a natural expansion of the Viedma colony and the Andes were the natural frontier to Chile. In the 1881 border treaty between Chile and Argentina, the Nahuel Huapi area was recognized as part of Argentina.

German settlers begun to arrive in neighboring southern Chile from the 1840s. Some of these settlers and their descendants begun a lucrative leather industry obtaining leather from indigenous communities across the Andes. In the 1880s, the Argentine Army displaced indigenous communities, disrupting this trade and forcing leather merchants in Chile to cross the Andes to obtain supplies. This way numerous entrepreneurs from Chile, many with a German background, established cattle and trade business in the area of Nahuel Huapi and Lácar lakes.

=== Modern settlement ===
In the summer of 1894-1895 Carlos Wiederhold, a German-Chilean from Osorno, Chile, crossed the poorly known mountain passes of the Andes from Chile into Nahual Huapi Lake. He was aided by the guide Antonio Millaqueo and Daniel Márquez from Chiloé helped them in navigating the lake. Back in Chile Wiederhold bought provisions in Puerto Montt and brought them across the Andes to sell these in the Nahuel Huapi area. Wiederhold established then a little shop called &quot;La Alemana&quot; (The German) in 1895, and it is from this shop the modern settlement of Bariloche developed from. As Wiederhold was named consul of the German Empire in Chile he left Bariloche for Puerto Montt in the 1900s. In Puerto Montt Wiederhold continued to run the business while in Bariloche Wiederhold&#x27;s business partner Federico Hube, also a German-Chilean from Osorno, was left in charge of local affairs. By 1900 Chilean merchants dominated trade in the area of Nahuel Huapi Lake by their control of nearby mountain passes. Hube &amp; Achelis controlled Paso Pérez Rosales and Camino y Lacoste did so in Paso Puyehue. A war scare between Chile and Argentina in the 1900s meant some difficulties for these earlier entrepreneurs who later came to benefit from the 1902 boundary arbitration between Chile and Argentina which increased trust along the international boundary. The trade route established by Wiederhold connecting the Pacific port of Puerto Montt with Nahuel Huapi Lake in the inland was well into the 1910s among the most important ones in northern Patagonia.

The Chilean entrepreneurs expanded beyond trade and established husbandry operations around Nahuel Huapi Lake. These enterprises exported meat to Central Chile and imported labour from southern Chile, mainly Chiloé Archipelago, to run the business. Argentine authorities encouraged at first the immigration of Chileans offering land properties if they renounced the Chilean citizenship becoming Argentines. Chilean authorities responded by offering land to those that returned from Argentina. As spontaneous migration from Chiloé Archipelago begun to replace those brought in by enterprises the Argentine authorities came to distrust these migrants. Many independent settlers from Chiloé Archipelago established themselves in Valle Manso south of Bariloche. In the words of historian Jorge Muñoz Sougarett, Argentine authorities viewed these Chileans settlers as &quot;illiterate nomads, vicious and unruly&quot;.

In the 1930s, the centre of the city was redesigned to have the appearance of a traditional European central alpine town (it was called &quot;Little Switzerland.&quot;) Many buildings were made of wood and stone. In 1909 there were 1,250 inhabitants; a telegraph, post office, and a road connected the city with Neuquén. Commerce continued to depend on Chile until the arrival of the railroad in 1934, which connected the city with Argentine markets.

===Architectural development and tourism===
Between 1935 and 1940, the Argentine Directorate of National Parks carried out a number of urban public works, giving the city a distinctive architectural style. Among them, perhaps the best-known is the Civic Centre.

Bariloche grew from being a centre of cattle trade that relied on commerce with Chile, to becoming a tourism centre for the Argentine elite. It took on a cosmopolitan architectural and urban profile. Growth in the city&#x27;s tourist trade began in the 1930s, when local hotel occupancy grew from 1550 tourists in 1934 to 4000 in 1940. In 1934 Ezequiel Bustillo, then director of the National Parks Direction, contracted his brother Alejandro Bustillo to build several buildings in Iguazú and Nahuel Huapi National Park (Bariloche was the main settlement inside the park). In contrast to subtropical Iguazú National Park, planners and developers thought that Nahuel Huapi National Park, because of its temperate climate, could compete with the tourism of Europe. Together with Bariloche, it was established for priority projects by national tourism development planners.Alejandro Bustillo designed the Edificio Movilidad, Plaza Perito Moreno, the Neo-Gothic San Carlos de Bariloche Cathedral, and the Llao Llao Hotel. Architect Ernesto de Estrada designed the Civic Centre of Bariloche, which opened in 1940. The Civic Centre&#x27;s tuff stone, slate and &quot;Fitzroya&quot; structures include the Domingo Sarmiento Library, the Francisco Moreno Museum of Patagonia, City Hall, the Post Office, the Police Station, and the Customs.

U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower visited Bariloche as a guest of President Arturo Frondizi in 1960. Classical violinist Alberto Lysy established the string quartet Camerata Bariloche in 1967.

===Huemul Project===
During the 1950s, on the small island of Huemul, not far into lake Nahuel Huapi, former president Juan Domingo Perón tried to have the world&#x27;s first fusion reactor built secretly. The project cost the equivalent of about $300 million modern US dollars, and it was never finished, due to the lack of the highly advanced technology that was needed. The Austrian Ronald Richter was in charge of the project. The facilities can still be visited, and are visible from certain locations on the coast.

=== Nazis in Bariloche ===

In 1995, Bariloche made headlines in the international press when it became known as a place for Nazi war criminals, such as the former SS &quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; Erich Priebke and SS officer Reinhard Kopps, known in Argentina as Juan Maler. Priebke had been the director of the German School of Bariloche for many years.

The narrative that Adolf Hitler did not commit suicide, but instead escaped Berlin, was first presented to the general public by Marshal Georgy Zhukov at a press conference on 9 June 1945 on orders from Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. That month, 68% of Americans polled thought Hitler was still alive. When asked at the Potsdam Conference in July 1945 how Hitler had died, Stalin said he was either living &quot;in Spain or Argentina.&quot;

In his 2004 book &quot;Bariloche nazi-guía turística&quot;, Argentine author Abel Basti claims that Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun lived in the surroundings of Bariloche for many years after World War II. Basti said that the Argentine Nazis chose the estate of &quot;Inalco&quot; as Hitler&#x27;s refuge.

&quot;Grey Wolf: The Escape of Adolf Hitler&quot;, a 2011 book by British authors Simon Dunstan and Gerrard Williams, proposed that Hitler and Eva Braun escaped from Berlin in 1945 and flew to Denmark, then on to Spain and from there to the Canary Islands, where they boarded a U-Boat and crossed the Atlantic to Argentina, where thousands of Nazis were provided sanctuary by president Juan Perón, who, with his wife Eva Perón, had been receiving money from the Nazis for some time. As claims received by the FBI stated, Hitler allegedly arrived in Argentina, first staying at Hacienda San Ramón, a rural property east of Bariloche owned by Stephan von Schaumburg-Lippe, a relative of Prince Bernhard, then moved to a Bavarian-style mansion at Inalco, a remote and barely accessible spot at the northwest end of Nahuel Huapi Lake, close to the Chilean border. Supposedly, Eva Braun left Hitler around 1954 and moved to Neuquén with their daughter Ursula (&#x27;Uschi&#x27;). Adolf Hitler died in February 1962 at age 73, and Eva Braun was alleged to be alive in the 2000s.

These accounts are disputed by most historians, who generally believe that Hitler and Braun committed suicide in the Führerbunker during last days of World War II.

==Tourism==
Tourism, both domestic and international, is the main economic activity of Bariloche throughout the year. The city is very popular with Brazilians, Europeans and Israelis. One of the most popular activities is skiing, and most tourists visit Bariloche in winter (June–September). Regular flights from Buenos Aires via LAN airlines and Aerolíneas Argentinas serve the city year round. The main ski slopes are the ones at Cerro Catedral, the biggest ski resort in South America and in the southern hemisphere. During the summer, beautiful beaches such as Playa Bonita and Villa Tacul welcome sun-bathers; brave lake swimmers venture into its cold waters (chilled by melting snow). Lake Nahuel Huapi averages in the summertime. Bariloche is the biggest city of a huge Lakes District, and it serves as a base for many excursions in the region. Activities such as fishing, whitewater rafting, and birdwatching are popular with tourists. Trekking along trails in the nearby mountain wilderness is supported by a few high-mountain huts operated by the Club Andino Bariloche. The city is noted for its chocolates and Swiss-style architecture. Many high school students in Argentina take a senior trip to Bariloche, and the town is well prepared to host these kinds of groups. In November 2012, Bariloche was named &quot;national capital of adventure tourism&quot; under Law 26802 sanctioned by the Argentine National Congress.

==Science==

Besides tourism and related services, Bariloche is home of advanced scientific and technological activities. The Centro Atómico Bariloche is a research center of the National Atomic Energy Commission, where basic and applied research in many areas of the physical sciences is carried out. The complex also houses Instituto Balseiro, a higher education institution of the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, with a small and carefully selected number of students. The institute confers degrees in Physics and Nuclear, Mechanical and Telecommunications Engineering, as well as Masters and Doctorate degrees in Physics and Engineering. The city also hosts INVAP, a high-technology company that designs and builds nuclear reactors, state-of-the-art radars and space satellites, among other projects.

The private, non-profit organization Bariloche Foundation continues the tradition of scientific research in the city. Started in 1963, it promotes postgraduate teaching and research. There are also several departments and laboratories at the National University of Comahue.

== Geography ==

Bariloche lies in the transition between a cool Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;) and an Oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;), with marked alpine characteristics (low nighttime temperatures, wide temperature variations, high thermal amplitude). The combination of its altitude, latitude, and predominance of west-northwest winds cause the climate to be classified as a cool temperate climate with a dry season that presents a west–east precipitation gradient. Mean annual precipitation ranges from in the Andean peaks and in Puerto Blest to only in the Limay River area. In the urban areas, mean annual precipitation ranges from . Most of this is concentrated in autumn and winter, which are responsible for 70% of the annual precipitation.

The mean annual temperature in Bariloche is in the city centre (1901–1950). At the airport in the eastern end, the mean annual temperature is (for the period 1981–2010). In January, daytime temperatures normally range from and may occasionally go up to . The average minimum in January is at the city centre and at the airport although during warm days, nighttime temperatures can reach to . In winter, daytime temperatures range from while nighttime temperatures approach freezing or less. Temperatures vary by altitude; in general, the temperature decreases by for every increase in altitude.

The weather is characterized by being windy throughout the year; 85% of the days are windy and calm days are rare. Most of the wind predominantly comes from the west-northwest with easterly winds being rare. Normally, the winds are strong, particularly in spring where gusts can exceed .

At the city centre, mean annual precipitation is in which there are 122 days with precipitation. In the eastern end where the airport is located, precipitation is lower, averaging . In winter when temperatures are lower, snowfall can occur, which is favoured by the low evapotranspiration. In spring, melt from snow and lower temperatures lead to moist conditions that facilitate the development of dense forest and agricultural activities.

The water temperatures in the lakes are always low, ranging from . This is due to the lakes being large, making it difficult for the sun to influence their temperature, owing to their large heat capacity. Smaller lakes can freeze in the winter, particularly those located in the higher elevations.

The central parts of Bariloche are built on a landscape of moraines and, next to the lake, of alluvial and lacustrine plains and terraces. The subsoil of the city consists partially of a succession of tills deposited during the Last Ice Age.

==Flora==
Bariloche is in the transition area between the Patagonian steppe and Valdivian forest, therefore it is rich in a variety of native species, of which the following is a list.
* Fitzroya cupressoides, Alerce
* Drimys winteri, Canelo
* Lomatia hirsuta, Radal
* Nothofagus nervosa, Raulí
* Nothofagus dombeyi, Coihue

==Transportation==

The city is served by San Carlos de Bariloche International Airport (IATA BRC/ICAO SAZS) equipped to receive any kind of aircraft. Several of Argentina&#x27;s most important airlines maintain regular flights to Bariloche, as well as some international lines from neighbouring countries, especially during the ski season. The city is linked by train with the city of Viedma through the Tren Patagonico that crosses Argentina from the Andes to the Atlantic Ocean.

Bariloche can also be reached by buses and private cars. The main land routes from North are RN 40, coming from Villa La Angostura, San Martín de los Andes and Mendoza Province, and RN 237 that enters from Neuquén and connects through Argentine&#x27;s route system with Buenos Aires and Eastern/Central Argentina. Other options are, from the East, by RN 23 (partially paved), crossing the railway line to Viedma (&quot;Línea Sur&quot;), or from the South by RN 40, coming from the town of El Bolsón (until 2003 this road was numbered RN 258).

San Carlos de Bariloche lies close to the Chilean border and is connected to Chile by the Cardenal Antonio Samoré Pass (125 km North-West from Bariloche, near Villa La Angostura) crossing the Andes Mountains.

A terminal railway station links Bariloche to Viedma.

===Internal transportation===

Within the city, Mibus is the single mass transit bus company that works, this bus line operates with the SUBE card. The Company Las Grutas that connects Bariloche with Dina Huapi also runs through part of the city, although this line operates with its own card.

==Military==
Bariloche is home of the army&#x27;s &quot;12° Regimiento de Infantería de Montaña&quot; (12th Mountain Infantry Regiment), where military personnel are instructed in mountainous conditions, including combat, survival, and skiing. It is usual for the Regiment to receive infantry personnel from other parts of the country and train them. Furthermore, the &quot;Escuela Militar de Montaña&quot;, the mountain warfare school of the Argentine Army is located in Bariloche.

==Neighbourhoods==
The main Neighbourhoods are Belgrano, Jardín Botánico, Melipal, Centro, Las Victorias, Las Marias, Dos Valles, and Playa Bonita.

== Municipal landfill – Health policies ==

The city of Bariloche has one of the fifty most dangerous landfills for natural environment of the world. This was indicated by a report that was carried out by the environmental organization International Solid Waste Association (ISWA), based in Austria.

The request for the transfer of the Bariloche dump, located on National Route 40 (Argentina) south, was being surrounded by neighborhoods with a high population density, it is already historic. Added to the situation of environmental collapse is the desperate situation of a large number of people who go to the dump daily in search of food or shelter. In addition, the fires in various sectors of the landfill also became recurrent, affecting not only those who work in the dump but also the closest neighborhoods, without forgetting to mention the forests that surround it, the fauna that inhabits them, and the water, that is deposited in layers that end up in the lake from which the local inhabitants extract the water to drink.

== Sports ==
The &quot;Andean Club Bariloche&quot; () was co-organiser of the 1st and the 3rd South American Ski Mountaineering Championships.

The Club Deportivo Cruz del Sur takes part in Torneo Federal B, the fourth tier of the Argentine football league system. The sides &quot;Estudiantes Unidos&quot; and &quot;Estrella del Sur&quot; also participated in lower Argentine leagues.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Bariloche is twinned with:
* Aspen, United States
* L&#x27;Aquila, Italy
* Osorno, Chile
* Puerto Montt, Chile

<text>Lai King is an MTR rapid transit station in the suburb of Lai King in the Kwai Tsing District. The station is located above ground on a viaduct and is an interchange for the Tsuen Wan and Tung Chung lines.

The Chinese name of the station uses the classical character of instead of the contemporary version of . The former is regarded as orthodox per the &quot;Kangxi dictionary&quot;. The same goes for Lai Chi Kok station which shares the same character.

==History==

=== Tsuen Wan Line ===
Lai King was opened on 10 May 1982 as an intermediate stop on the . The station was built to serve the adjacent public housing complex and the container terminal on the coast. The station contractor was Maeda-Okumura joint venture.

=== Tung Chung Line ===
When the rail link to Lantau Island was announced, Lai King was chosen to be the interchange between the Tsuen Wan line and the then proposed . The new line&#x27;s construction of a station and tunnels was awarded to Maeda Corporation under Contract 508 in December 1994. During the construction of the Tung Chung line platforms, the layout of the station was significantly altered. New tracks were added above the existing tracks to provide a cross-platform interchange between the Tung Chung and Tsuen Wan lines. The outbound Tsuen Wan line trains now stops on the same level as the outbound Tung Chung line trains, and the same goes for the inbound services.

An additional pair of tracks was constructed to permit the trains to bypass Lai King without stopping. The station is made up of six tracks with four platforms.

The station has opened a toilet on 31 October 2019.

== Station layout ==

Outbound (Tung Chung-bound) passengers on the Tung Chung line can walk across the platform at Lai King to board the Tsuen Wan line trains for destinations in Kwai Chung and Tsuen Wan.

Those who are travelling to Central and Hong Kong Island from Kwai Chung and Tsuen Wan can transfer at Lai King, across the platform, for an express service on the Tung Chung line. Given both the Tsuen Wan line and Tung Chung line trains terminate at the Central &amp; Hong Kong station complex, most passenger opt for the latter as it makes fewer stops. As a result, the station is often crowded at peak hours given the number of transfer passengers.

<text>John Kendrick (1573 – 30 December 1624) was a prosperous English cloth merchant and patron of the towns of Reading and Newbury in Berkshire.

==Life==
John Kendrick was born in Reading, Berkshire, possibly in Minster Street, in 1573 to Thomas Kendrick, a prominent citizen, weaving merchant and subsequently a mayor of Reading (1580), and his wife, Agnes Bye. He was related to the Kendrick family of Chester, and the subsequent John Kendrick, Lord Mayor of London (1651). Kendrick was baptised on 18 May 1574 at nearby St Mary&#x27;s Church, Reading. His younger brother William (1577-1634) was the pro-genitor of the Kendrick baronets. Together, they had at least 3 sisters: Anne, Elizabeth and Alice. Kendrick was educated at Reading School and St John&#x27;s College, Oxford. After university, he moved to London, where he amassed a fortune in trade with the Netherlands.

Kendrick died on 30 December 1624 at his home in Threadneedle Street, London. He was buried at St Christopher le Stocks Church, which was demolished in 1781, and later re-buried at Nunhead Cemetery.

==Legacy==
In his will, Kendrick left £12,500 to the towns of Reading and Newbury to provide employment and education for the poor. The Oracle workhouse, was erected in Minster Street, Reading with this money. This name was revived for the Oracle shopping mall which now occupies a small part of the site.

Although the funds left by Kendrick were mismanaged, sufficient remained for the founding of two schools: &quot;Kendrick Boys School&quot; in 1875 and &quot;Kendrick Girls School&quot; in 1877. In 1915, Kendrick Boys School was taken over by Reading School, which now has a building named the John Kendrick Building. An oil painting of John Kendrick, rescued from the Oracle workhouse, hangs in the hall of Kendrick Girls School, nowadays called &quot;Kendrick School&quot;. The caption reads &quot;John Kendrick, founder of this worke house&quot;.

The £4,000 Kendrick left to Newbury was used to build a &#x27;cloth manufactory&#x27; where unemployed clothworkers could be employed until the trade in the town recovered. The trade never recovered and the building went through several uses (workhouse, hospital, school, warehousing) before being restored in 1903 as the Newbury Borough Museum. Now known as the Cloth Hall, it forms a part of the West Berkshire Museum. Kendrick&#x27;s cash was also used to fund a charity offering education and apprenticeships to selected children of Newbury&#x27;s poor.

<text>DJ Logic (born Lee Jason Kibler, 1972) is an American DJ primarily known for his work in nu-jazz, acid-jazz, and with jam bands.

== Life and career ==
Born and raised in The Bronx, New York, Kibler displayed an early interest in hip hop, funk, and jazz music. He began practicing on the turntables and collaborating with various musicians, creating recordings best described as a contemporary soul jazz with a string hip hop feel.

Kibler often tours with his own group, Project Logic, and has recorded or performed with Vernon Reid, moe., John Mayer, Medeski Martin &amp; Wood, Bob Belden, Jack Johnson, Chris Whitley, Uri Caine, Christian McBride and others.

On September 10, 2001, Project Logic performed the final official show at Wetlands Preserve before the closing of the venue, featuring special guests Warren Haynes of The Allman Brothers Band and Gov&#x27;t Mule, Stanley Jordan and Mike Gordon.

On April 6, 2006, Kibler sat in with Bob Weir&#x27;s RatDog, adding his style to the famous Grateful Dead song combo &quot;China Cat Sunflower/I Know You Rider.&quot; He is a founding member of The John Popper Project. On August 15, 2009, Kibler sat in with O.A.R. at Madison Square Garden, adding his style to their latest single, &quot;This Town&quot;.

Kibler has often cited his mentor as Vernon Reid. The duo have recorded and toured as the Yohimbe Brothers with various guests, and Kibler has appeared on studio and live performances on Reid&#x27;s solo projects. Reid also performed a guest solo for Kibler&#x27;s original Band Eye and I, which featured D.K. Dyson and Melvin Gibbs, who has played on all of Kibler&#x27;s solo releases.

<text>Fr. Tomás de Santa María O.P. (also Tomás de Sancta Maria) (ca. 1510 – 1570) was a Spanish music theorist, organist and composer of the Renaissance. He was born in Madrid but the date is highly uncertain; he died in Ribadavia. Little is known about his life except that he joined the Dominican order of friars in 1536, he was employed as an organist in various locales in mid-century, and he published his major work, &quot;Arte de tañer fantasía&quot;, in Valladolid in 1565.

This book is a comprehensive work on keyboard technique of the time. Its principal aim is to teach how to improvise in a fugal style, but to get to that point, difficult to the most accomplished musicians of any age, he includes detailed treatments of the rudiments of music, the eight church modes, ornaments, touch, articulation, fingering, and counterpoint, including a categorization of four-note chords, rather similar to what Pietro Aron had written several decades before in Italy (which work he may have used as a source). The classification of chords is especially significant for this is the period in music history during which composers began to think in terms of harmonic progression as a generative mechanism rather than purely the happenstance of intersecting, independent melodic lines. Santa María&#x27;s book also gives instruction for creating music using the paired imitation technique of Josquin des Prez, who he clearly held to be the master of the style.

Santa María&#x27;s writings were influential both inside of Spain and throughout the rest of Europe, as can be seen by the numerous early Baroque music theorists (for example Dámaso Artufel and Pietro Cerone) who plagiarized him. The preface to the 1565 edition mentions that the influential clavichordist and organist Antonio de Cabezón (and his brother Juan de Cabezón) examined the treatise and approved it.

<text>Hawaii is a novel by James A. Michener published in 1959, the year that Hawaii became the 50th U.S. state. It has been translated into 32 languages.

The historical correctness of the novel is high, although the narrative about the early Polynesian inhabitants is based more on folklore than anthropological and archaeological sources. It is written in episodic format, like many of Michener&#x27;s works, and narrates the stories of the original Hawaiians who sailed to the islands from Bora Bora, the early American missionaries and merchants, and the Chinese and Japanese immigrants who traveled to work and seek their fortunes in Hawaii. The story begins with the formation of the islands themselves millions of years ago and ends in the mid-1950s. Each section explores the experiences of different groups of arrivals.

== Development ==
For Hawaiian history, Michener researched at the Hawaiian-Mission Historical Library and consulted experts on island history, volcanoes, botany, pineapples, and Chinese culture. His technical adviser, noted Hawaiian scholar Clarice B. Taylor, explained customs, language, family names, and nuances of Hawaiian culture to Michener. Taylor said, &quot;The things you want are not in books...all this material you want has to come out of my head. A book cannot tell you how a Polynesian acts or how he talks.&quot;

Several characters in the novel are inspired by actual individuals. The character Reverend Abner Hale is a caricature of true-life missionary Hiram Bingham I. Asa Thurston was also a model for a missionary character in the novel. Chinn Ho, the &quot;Chinese Rockefeller&quot;, was popularly considered to be the inspiration for the character Hong Kong Kee.

== Plot ==
The novel tells the history of Hawaiian Islands from the creation of the isles to the time they became an American state through the viewpoints of selected characters who represent their ethnic and cultural groups in the story (e.g. the Kee family represents the viewpoint of Chinese-Hawaiians). Most of the chapters cover the arrivals of different peoples to the islands. With the exception of Chapter 1, all the chapters are of standalone novel or novella length.

# From the Boundless Deep describes the creation of the Hawaiian land from volcanic activity. It goes into flavorful detail describing such things as primary succession taking root on the island to life finally blooming.
# From the Sunswept Lagoon begins on the island of Bora Bora, where many people, including King Tamatoa and his brother Teroro, are upset with the neighboring isles of Havaiki, Tahiti etc. because they are trying to force the Bora Borans to give up their old gods, Tāne and Ta&#x27;aroa, and start worshiping &#x27;Oro, the fire god, who constantly demands human sacrifices. Tamatoa suggests to his brother and friends that they should migrate to some other place where they might find religious freedom. After finally agreeing to this plan, his brother secretly sets fire to Havaiki to take revenge for the human sacrifices they have been demanding from Bora Borans. Later they take the canoe &quot;Wait for the West Wind&quot; and sail to Hawaii. Later some return to Bora Bora to bring back with them some women and children and an idol of the volcano goddess, Pele.
# From the Farm of Bitterness follows the journey of the first Christian missionaries to Hawaii in the 1800s and their influence over Hawaiian culture and customs. Many of the missionaries become founding families in the islands, including the Hales and Whipples. 
# From the Starving Village covers the immigration of Chinese to work on the pineapple and sugarcane plantations. The patriarch of the Kee family contracts leprosy (a.k.a. the ‘Chinese sickness’) and is sent to the leper colony in Molokai. Chapter 4 includes a fictionalized version of 1893 historical events known as the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii.
# From The Inland Sea focuses on Japanese workers brought to the islands to replace Chinese laborers; the latter begin to set up their own businesses. It also covers the bombing of Pearl Harbor.
# The Golden Men summarizes the changes in Hawaiian culture and economics based on the intermarriages of various groups in the islands.

== Cinematic adaptations ==
The film &quot;Hawaii&quot; (1966), starring Max von Sydow and Julie Andrews was released in 1966. The film focused on the book&#x27;s third chapter, ‘From the Farm of Bitterness’, which covered the settlement of the island kingdom by its first American missionaries.

A sequel, &quot;The Hawaiians&quot; (1970), starring Charlton Heston, covered subsequent chapters of the book, including the arrival of the Chinese and Japanese and the growth of the plantations.

<text>107 Camilla is one of the largest asteroids from the outermost edge of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It is a member of the Sylvia family and located within the Cybele group. It was discovered on 17 November 1868, by English astronomer Norman Pogson at Madras Observatory, India, and named after Camilla, Queen of the Volsci in Roman mythology. The X-type asteroid is a rare triple asteroid with two minor-planet moons discovered in 2001 and 2016, respectively. It is elongated in shape and has a short rotation period of 4.8 hours.

== Physical characteristics ==
Camilla has a very dark surface and primitive carbonaceous composition.

A large number of rotational lightcurves of have been obtained from photometric observations since the 1980s. Best rated results gave a short rotation period of 4.844 hours with a brightness amplitude between 0.32 and 0.53 magnitude.

Lightcurve analysis indicates that Camilla&#x27;s pole most likely points towards ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (+51°, 72°) with a 10° uncertainty, which gives it an axial tilt of 29°. Follow-up modeling of photometric data gave similar results.

=== Diameter and albedo ===

10μ radiometric data collected from Kitt Peak in 1975 gave a first diameter estimate of 209 km. According to the space-based surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS and the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, as well as observations by the Keck Observatory and photometric modeling, Camilla measures between 185 and 247 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.160 and 0.294.

== Satellites ==

Camilla is the 6th triple asteroid that has been discovered in the asteroid belt, after 87 Sylvia, 45 Eugenia, 216 Kleopatra, 93 Minerva and 130 Elektra (a quaternary).

=== Outer satellite ===
On 1 March 2001, a minor-planet moon of Camilla was found by A. Storrs, F. Vilas, R. Landis, E. Wells, C. Woods, B. Zellner, and M. Gaffey using the Hubble Space Telescope. It has the provisional designation but has not yet received an official name.

Later observations in September 2005 with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) allowed the determination of an orbit. In addition to the data in the infobox at right, the inclination was found to be 3 ± 1° with respect to an axis pointing towards (β, λ) = (+55°, 75°). Given the ~10° uncertainty in the actual rotational axis of Camilla, one can say that the orbit&#x27;s inclination is less than 10°.

The satellite is estimated to measure about 11 km in diameter. Assuming a similar density to the primary, this would give it an approximate mass of ~1.5 kg. It has a similar colour to the primary.

=== Inner satellite ===
In 2016, the discovery of a second satellite of Camilla was reported by astronomers at Cerro Paranal&#x27;s Very Large Telescope in Chile. It has the provisional designation .

Observations were taken between 29 May 2015 and 30 July 2016, using the VLT-SPHERE, the principal instrument attached to the 8-meter &quot;Melipal&quot; (UT3) unit of the VLT. On 3 out of 5 observation sessions, the new satellite could be detected. The body&#x27;s orbit has a semi-major axis of 340 kilometers.

<text>Kim Robert Stafford (born October 15, 1949) is an American poet and essayist who lives in Portland, Oregon.

==Early life and education==
Born and raised in Portland, Oregon, Stafford is the son of poet William Stafford. He earned a Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts in English, and Ph.D. in medieval literature from the University of Oregon.

== Career ==
Since 1979, he has taught writing at Lewis &amp; Clark College in Portland. He has also taught courses at Willamette University in Salem, at the Sitka Center for Art and Ecology, at the Fishtrap writers&#x27; gathering, and private workshops in Scotland, Italy, and Bhutan.

In July 2018, he was appointed the 9th Oregon Poet Laureate by Governor Kate Brown. He served in the role until 2020.

He is the founding director of the Northwest Writing Institute and is the literary executor of the Estate of William Stafford.

He was also a contributor to the Multnomah County project &quot;When You Were 15,&quot; in which &quot;adults from our community share their stories about how an adult made a difference to them when they were fifteen. Several stories from today’s young people prove that they, too, need caring adults. These real life stories show how even a small act of encouragement can make a big difference in a teen’s life.&quot;

His work is featured at the Orenco Station on the Rings of Memory Plaza and the Witness Tree Rest.

<text>Francisco Guerrero (October 4 (?), 1528 – November 8, 1599) was a Spanish Catholic priest and composer of the Renaissance. He was born and died in Seville.

==Life and career==
Guerrero&#x27;s early musical education was with his older brother Pedro and after that with the famous composer Cristóbal de Morales. At the age of 18 he was appointed &quot;maestro de capilla&quot; (i.e. music director) at Jaén Cathedral. Three years later he accepted a position of singer at Seville Cathedral. During this time he was much in demand as a singer and composer, establishing an exceptional reputation before his thirtieth birthday; in addition he published several collections of his music abroad, an unusual event for a young composer.

After several decades of working and traveling throughout Spain and Portugal, sometimes in the employ of emperor Maximilian II, he went to Italy for a year (1581–1582) where he published two books of his music. After returning to Spain for several years, he decided to travel to the Holy Land, which he finally was able to do in 1589. His adventure included visits to Damascus, Bethlehem, and Jerusalem; on the return trip his ship was twice attacked by pirates, who threatened his life, stole his money, and held him for ransom. He was able to return to Spain; unfortunately he had no money, and endured a series of misfortunes, including some time spent in debtors&#x27; prison. At last his old employer at Seville Cathedral extricated Guerrero and he resumed working for them. His book on his adventurous visit to the Holy Land was published in 1590 and was a popular success (it is reasonable to suppose that Cervantes knew it). At the end of the decade he planned one more trip to the Holy Land but died in the plague of 1599 in Seville before he was able to depart.

Of all the Spanish Renaissance composers, he lived and worked the most in Spain. Others—for example Morales and Victoria—spent large portions of their careers in Italy (though, unlike many Franco-Flemish composers of the time, Spanish composers usually returned home later in life).

Guerrero&#x27;s music was both sacred and secular, unlike that of Victoria and Morales, the two other Spanish 16th-century composers of the first rank. He wrote numerous secular songs and instrumental pieces, in addition to masses, motets, and Passions. He was able to capture an astonishing variety of moods in his music, from ecstasy to despair, longing, joy, and devotional stillness; his music remained popular for hundreds of years, especially in cathedrals in Latin America. Stylistically he preferred homophonic textures, rather like his Spanish contemporaries, and he wrote memorable, singable lines. One interesting feature of his style is how he anticipated functional harmonic usage: there is a case of a Magnificat discovered in Lima, Peru, once thought to be an anonymous 18th century work, which turned out to be a work of his.

<text>108 Hecuba is a fairly large and bright main-belt asteroid. It was discovered by Karl Theodor Robert Luther on 2 April 1869, and named after Hecuba, wife of King Priam in the legends of the Trojan War in Greek Mythology. This object is orbiting the Sun with a period of 5.83 years and an eccentricity of 0.06. It became the first asteroid discovered to orbit near a 2:1 mean-motion resonance with the planet Jupiter, and is the namesake of the Hecuba group of asteroids.

In the Tholen classification system, it is categorized as a stony S-type asteroid, while the Bus asteroid taxonomy system lists it as an Sw asteroid. Observations performed at the Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado Springs, Colorado in during 2007 produced a light curve with a period of 17.859 ± 0.005 hours with a brightness variation of 0.11 ± 0.02 in magnitude.

Hecuba orbits within the Hygiea family of asteroids but is not otherwise related to other family members because it has a silicate composition; Hygieas are dark C-type asteroids.

<text>109 Felicitas is a dark and fairly large main-belt asteroid. It was discovered by German-American astronomer C. H. F. Peters on October 9, 1869, and named after Felicitas, the Roman goddess of . The only observed stellar occultation by Felicitas is one from Japan (March 29, 2003).

This body is orbiting the Sun with a period of 4.43 years and an eccentricity (ovalness) of 0.3. Its orbital plane is inclined by 7.9° from the plane of the ecliptic. 109 Felicitas is classified as a carbonaceous GC-type asteroid. It is spinning with a rotation period of 13.2 hours. During 2002, 109 Felicitas was observed by radar from the Arecibo Observatory. The return signal matched an effective diameter of 89 ± 9 km. This is consistent with the asteroid dimensions computed through other means.

<doc id="738817" wikidata="Q952612" url="?curid=738817" title="Cyclic form">
<text>Cyclic form is a technique of musical construction, involving multiple sections or movements, in which a theme, melody, or thematic material occurs in more than one movement as a unifying device. Sometimes a theme may occur at the beginning and end (for example, in Mendelssohn&#x27;s A minor String Quartet or Brahms&#x27;s Symphony No. 3); other times a theme occurs in a different guise in every part (e.g. Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot;, and Saint-Saëns&#x27;s &quot;Organ&quot; Symphony).

The technique has a complex history, having fallen into disuse in the Baroque and Classical eras, but steadily increasing in use during the nineteenth century.

The Renaissance cyclic mass, which incorporates a usually well-known portion of plainsong as a cantus firmus in each of its sections, is an early use of this principle of unity in a multiple-section form. Examples can also be found in late-sixteenth- and seventeenth-century instrumental music, for instance in the canzonas, sonatas, and suites by composers such as Samuel Scheidt, in which a ground bass may recur in each movement When the movements are short enough and begin to be heard as a single entity rather than many, the boundaries begin to blur between cyclic form and variation form.

Cyclic technique is not typically found in the instrumental music of the most famous composers from the Baroque and &quot;high classical&quot; eras, though it may still be found in the music of such figures as Luigi Boccherini and Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf.

Nevertheless, in the Classical period, cyclic technique is found in several works of Mozart: In String Quartet in D minor K. 421, all the four movements are unified by the motif, &quot;F-A-C-C-C-C&quot;. In String Quartet No.18 in A major K. 464, different rhythmic motifs of the concept &quot;long-short-short-short&quot; of the first movement and second movement combine in the finale. Mladjenović, Bogunović, Masnikosa, and Radak state that Mozart&#x27;s Fantasia, K. 475, with its multi-movement structure inscribed in a one-movement sonata form, started something later finished by Liszt in his B minor Piano Sonata. Joseph Haydn uses cyclic technique at the end of the Symphony No. 31, where the music recalls the horn call heard at the very opening of the work.

In sacred vocal music of Baroque and Classical periods, there are several examples of cyclic technique, such as Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s Mass in B minor and Mozart&#x27;s Mass in C major, K. 317, Spatzenmesse in C major K. 220, Litaniae de venerabili altaris sacramento K. 243, and especially Requiem in D minor K. 626, where the &quot;DNA&quot; of the Lutheran hymn motif, &quot;D-C#-D-E-F&quot;, permeates the entire work. 

Although other composers were already using this technique, it is Beethoven&#x27;s example that really popularised cyclic form for subsequent Romantic composers. In Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony, a large part of the scherzo movement is recalled to end the finale&#x27;s development section and lead into the recapitulation; the Ninth Symphony&#x27;s finale rapidly presents explicit reminiscences of the three preceding movements before discovering the idea that is to be its own principal theme; while both the Piano Sonata Op. 101 and Cello Sonata Op. 102 No. 2 similarly recall earlier movements before their finales.

In the 1820s, both Franz Schubert and the young Felix Mendelssohn wrote numerous important cyclic works: Schubert, in the &quot;Wanderer Fantasy&quot; (1822) created a &quot;4-in-1&quot; double-function design that would leave its mark decades later on Liszt, while Mendelssohn, in such works as the Octet (1825) and String Quartet No. 2 (1827) created highly integrated musical forms that proved influential for later Romantic composers. Another significant model was given by Hector Berlioz in his programmatic &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; of 1830, whose &quot;idée fixe&quot; serves as a cyclic theme throughout the five movements. By the 1840s, the technique is already quite established, being found in several works by Robert Schumann, Fanny Hensel, Niels Gade, Franz Berwald, and the earliest compositions of César Franck.

Mid-century, Franz Liszt in works such as the B minor Piano Sonata (1853) did a lot to popularize the cyclic techniques of thematic transformation and double-function form established by Schubert and Berlioz. Liszt&#x27;s sonata begins with a clear statement of several thematic units and each unit is extensively used and developed throughout the piece. By late in the century, cyclic form had become an extremely common principle of construction, most likely because the increasing length and complexity of multiple-movement works demanded a unifying method stronger than mere key relation. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Vincent d&#x27;Indy, a pupil of Franck, promoted the use of the term &quot;cyclic&quot; to describe the technique.

The term is more debatable in cases where the resemblance is less clear, such as in the works of Beethoven, who used very basic fragments. Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 5 is an example of cyclic form in which a theme is used throughout the symphony, but with different orchestration. The &quot;short-short-short-long&quot; four-note motive is embedded in each movement.

<text>Frans Hjalmar Nortamo (better known as Hj. Nortamo, also known as Nordling; 13 June 1860 in Rauma – 30 November 1931 in Pori) was a writer and a medical doctor who is usually associated with Rauma, Finland, although he also lived in other, neighboring towns and municipalities.

Nortamo is best known for his series of &#x27;Raumlaissi jaarituksi&#x27; (&#x27;Yarns from Rauma&#x27;), which was also a name of a book published in 1920. This body of writings has been written in the dialect of Rauma, and they are regarded as the first Finnish language texts that have been actually written in a dialect which is not mainstream Finnish. The dialect of Rauma has a lot of vocabulary that is reminiscent of the old seafaring days and ties with Swedish, English and German speaking countries, and therefore is locally regarded as its own language. Nortamo&#x27;s writings have been crucial in saving the knowledge of the dialect for the current generations.

<text>110 Lydia is a large belt asteroid with an M-type spectrum, and thus may be metallic in composition, consisting primarily of nickel-iron. It was discovered by French astronomer Alphonse Borrelly on 19 April 1870 and was named for Lydia, the Asia Minor country populated by Phrygians. The Lydia family of asteroids is named after it.

Observations made during 1958–1959 at the McDonald Observatory and in 1969 at the Kitt Peak National Observatory found an uneven light curve with a period of 10.9267 hours. In the late 1990s, a network of astronomers worldwide used light curves to derive spin states and shape models of 10 new asteroids, including (110) Lydia. They obtained a period of 10.92580 hours, with the brightness varying by no more than 0.2 in magnitude.

In the Tholen classification system, it is categorized as an M-type asteroid, while the Bus asteroid taxonomy system lists it as an Xk asteroid. Absorption features in the near infrared are attributed to low-iron, low-calcium orthopyroxene minerals. Water content on the surface is estimated at 0.14–0.27 by mass fraction (wt%). Measurements of the thermal inertia of 110 Lydia give a value between 70 and , compared to 50 for lunar regolith and 400 for coarse sand in an atmosphere. It is a likely interloper in the Padua family of minor planets that share similar dynamic properties.

Lydia occulted a dim star on 18 September 1999.

<text>Pietro Aron, also known as Pietro (or Piero) Aaron (c. 1480 – after 1545), was an Italian music theorist and composer. He was born in Florence and probably died in Bergamo (other sources state Florence or Venice).

==Biography==
Very little is known about Aron&#x27;s early life but at least one source claims he may have been Jewish. He was educated in Italy. Aron was a self-taught musician. He claimed in his &quot;Toscanello in musica&quot; (1523) that he had been friends with Obrecht, Josquin, and Heinrich Isaac in Florence. If true, the time frame would have been most likely in 1487. Between 1515 and 1522, he was Church Cantor at the Cathedral of Imola. In 1516 he became a priest there. In February 1523 Aron went to Venice and became cantor of Rimini Cathedral, where he worked for Sebastiano Michiel, who was Grand Prior of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem. In 1525, he was &quot;maestro di casa&quot; in a Venetian house. In 1536, after the death of Michiel, he joined a monastery in Bergamo where he remained until his death.

Aron is known for his treatises on the contrapuntal practice of the period. His earliest treatise, &quot;De institutione harmonica&quot;, on counterpoint, is written in Italian even though most scholarly writings of the time are in Latin. In &quot;Thoscanello de la musica&quot; (later &quot;Toscanello in musica&quot;), he was the first to observe the change from linear writing to vertical: this was the first period in music history where composers began to become conscious of chords and the flow of harmony. Aron included tables of four-voice chords, the beginning of the trend which was to result in functional tonality in the early 17th century. He also discusses tuning, and the book is the first to describe quarter-comma meantone. Other topics covered by Aron include the use of the eight modes, four-voice cadences, and notation of accidentals.

Aron was a friend and frequent correspondent of music theorist Giovanni Spataro. Only Spataro&#x27;s letters to Aron have survived. Topics discussed by the two include contemporary composers and composition, notation, and especially the use of accidentals.

While Aron was known as a composer and frequently refers to his own works in his writings, only one possible composition of his survives, the doubtfully attributed four-voice frottola, &quot;Io non posso piu durare&quot;, from Petrucci&#x27;s Fifth Book of Frottole (1505). Lost works include a Credo setting in six voices, a five-voice Mass, settings of &quot;In illo tempore loquente Jesu&quot;, &quot;Letatus sum&quot;, and &quot;Da pacem&quot;, and other motets and madrigals.

<text>The flammulated owl (Psiloscops flammeolus) is a small migratory North American owl in the family Strigidae. It is the only species placed in the genus Psiloscops.

==Taxonomy==
The flammulated owl was formally described in 1852 by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup under the binomial name &quot;Scops flammeola &quot;. He specified the type location as Mexico. This species was formerly placed with the scops owls in the genus &quot;Otus&quot; but is now placed in its own genus &quot;Psiloscops&quot; that was introduced in 1899 by Elliott Coues. The name &quot;Psiloscops&quot; combines the Ancient Greek &quot;psilos&quot; meaning &quot;naked&quot; or &quot;smooth&quot; with the genus name &quot;Scops&quot;, a synonym of &quot;Otus&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;flammeolus&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;flame-coloured&quot;, &quot;with flame-like markings&quot; or &quot;flammulated&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

A molecular phylogenetic study of the owls published in 2019 found that the flammulated owl is a sister species to the Puerto Rican owl (&quot;Gymnasio nudipes&quot;).

==Description==
The flammulated owl is a small, nocturnal owl approximately long with a wingspan. With such large wings for a small body, they can fly rapidly from tree to tree. Males and females can be distinguished by their weight. Females are larger, ranging from and males are smaller ranging from . The owl gets the name flammulated from the flame-like markings on its face.

The flammulated owl is similar in appearance to the western screech owl, but is only about one-quarter the mass, lacks large ear tufts (but has small ear tufts that are barely visible), and has dark eyes and a different voice. The elf owl is smaller and the mountain pygmy owl is about the same size. The call is a series of relatively deep, single or double hoots.

==Distribution and habitat==
It breeds from southern British Columbia and the western United States to central Mexico. It is a neotropical migrant and winters south of the United States, but also in South Texas, Arizona, and California. Unlike many owls, they are migratory, leaving Canada and the United States in the fall. In the winter, they are found in northern Central America, from southern Mexico to Guatemala and El Salvador. They leave their breeding grounds in August to head to their wintering areas, and then return to their breeding grounds in late April and early May.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===

The flammulated owl nests in tree cavities and has two to four young at a time after a 26-day incubation period. The young are able to forage for their own prey after about 25–32 days. These owls are obligate cavity nesters, meaning they only create nests in tree cavities. Females usually select cavities that used to be woodpecker or northern flicker nests. Their nests are bare and have no nesting material. Flammulated owls tend to form breeding pairs with unoccupied habitat between breeding clusters. Unlike most owls, the Flammulated Owl often nests in loose colonies. According to EBird.org, One observation group once found 47 singing birds along a five mile stretch of road near Provo, UT. They tend to have one clutch of eggs annually. Like other raptors, they can live long and have high nesting success, and during the nesting period, the female owls rely on the males to forage for them.
Nesting habitat in the western U.S. and Canada is usually mature, open ponderosa pine and Douglas fir forests. Flammulated owls can also be found breeding in deciduous forests with some conifers present. In deciduous habitat, they can still breed productively.

===Food and feeding===
They feed almost entirely on insects, but very occasionally eat small mammals such as shrews and small rodents. The insects they eat mostly consist of small Lepidoptera. They also eat crickets and beetles.

==Conservation status==
Currently, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the flammulated owl as a species of least concern, but populations may be declining in some areas.

<text>Mark Christian Bellhorn (born August 23, 1974) is an American former professional baseball infielder. In his ten-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career, Bellhorn was best known for being the starting second baseman for the Boston Red Sox during their 2004 World Series championship season.

==Personal life==
Bellhorn was born in Boston and was raised in the Orlando, Florida, suburb of Oviedo, where he attended St. Luke&#x27;s Lutheran School in Oviedo, FL and graduated from Oviedo High School. Bellhorn went on to attend Auburn from 1993 to 1996.

Mark Bellhorn has one brother, Todd, who played in the New York Mets minor league system in 1998 and 1999. Bellhorn married Lindsey Bopp, in May 2013. Their first child was born in June 2014. Their second child was born 2 years later.

==Career==

===Auburn University===
Bellhorn was drafted out of high school in the 37th round of the 1992 Free Agent Draft by the San Diego Padres, but did not sign. Instead, he attended Auburn University, where he played in the 1994 College World Series. In 1993, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League.

===Oakland Athletics===
After playing college ball at Auburn, Bellhorn broke into the majors with the Oakland Athletics in 1997, drafted in the second round. That year he managed a .228 batting average with six home runs and 19 runs batted in. Over the next three seasons with the Athletics he saw only limited playing time, batting .131 with one homer and five RBI.

===Chicago Cubs===
In 2002, Bellhorn was traded to the Chicago Cubs and hit .258 with 27 home runs and 56 RBI.

On August 29, 2002, Bellhorn became the first player in National League history to hit a home run from both sides of the plate in the same inning, doing so in the Cubs&#x27; ten–run 4th inning at Miller Park. Bellhorn also tied a team record with five RBI in the inning. His 2002 campaign was a record-setting season for the Cubs: his 27 home runs was the most-ever by a Cubs switch-hitter, and he became the first player in Cubs history to hit a home run from all four infield positions.

On June 20, 2003, he was traded to the Colorado Rockies, and finished the year hitting .221 with two home runs and 26 RBI.

===Boston Red Sox===
In 2004, Bellhorn was signed by the Boston Red Sox as a utility infielder; however, he became the regular second baseman after Pokey Reese and Nomar Garciaparra suffered early-season injuries. He proceeded to have the best batting average of his career, hitting .264 with 17 home runs and 82 RBI. Despite leading the league in strikeouts (177), Bellhorn was among the league leaders in walks (88, 3rd), pitches seen per at bat, batting average with runners in scoring position, and on-base percentage (.373, first among AL second baseman). Nearly half of his 2004 plate appearances resulted in a strikeout, walk or home run.

====2004 postseason====
For the first seven postseason games of his career as a member of the Boston Red Sox, Bellhorn had two hits in 25 at-bats (.080); however, his resurgence started when he broke up Mike Mussina&#x27;s perfect game in the 7th inning of Game 1 of the American League Championship Series versus the New York Yankees. Bellhorn then hit a three-run homer off Jon Lieber to give the Red Sox a 4–2 victory over the Yankees in Game 6. He also homered in Game 7 of the ALCS, which the Red Sox went on to win, sending the ball high and clanging it off the right-field foul pole.

Boston won Game 1 in the World Series, thanks to Bellhorn&#x27;s eighth-inning two-run home run off Julián Tavárez (again, hitting a ball off the foul pole, this time Pesky&#x27;s Pole at Fenway Park) to beat the St. Louis Cardinals 11–9. In doing so, Bellhorn became the first second baseman ever to homer in three consecutive postseason games. In Game 2, he hit a two-run double to help the Sox pull away to a 4–1 lead in an eventual 6–2 victory. The Red Sox went on to win the World Series in a four-game sweep of the Cardinals.

In fourteen post-season games, Bellhorn hit three doubles and three home runs with eight runs scored and eight RBI. He hit for a .191 batting average (9-for-44). His on-base percentage was .397, slugging average .447, and OPS .844.

Bellhorn appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated on November 1, 2004.

===After the Red Sox – Yankees, Padres, Reds===
In 2005, Bellhorn struggled, registering a lower batting average and dramatically increasing his strikeouts. The Red Sox eventually released him. Bellhorn signed with the New York Yankees days later.

He spent the rest of the 2005 season with the Yankees, appearing in nine games. For his short tenure with the team, he was named to the Yankees All-Forgotten team in 2014.

In 2006, he joined the San Diego Padres, playing in 115 games but hitting .190 for his batting average for the season.

In 2007, Bellhorn signed a minor-league deal with the Cincinnati Reds with an invitation as a non-roster player to the Reds&#x27; spring training camp. He was then optioned to their Triple-A affiliate, the Louisville Bats, and a few days later he accepted the minor-league assignment.

On August 12, 2007, the Reds designated Bellhorn for assignment to make room for Josh Hamilton, who was coming off the 15-day disabled list. On October 12, 2007, Bellhorn refused his outright assignment to the minors, becoming a free agent. In , he signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers and was assigned to their Double-A affiliate, the Jacksonville Suns. After a couple of months with the Suns, he was released by the Dodgers on July 24, 2008.

In February , Bellhorn signed a minor-league contract with his former team, the Colorado Rockies. He played that year for the Colorado Springs Sky Sox. Bellhorn was granted free agency that November, and subsequently retired.

<doc id="738832" wikidata="Q124070" url="?curid=738832" title="Heinrich Glarean">
<text>Heinrich Glarean also styled Henricus Glareanus (born as Heinrich Loriti on 28 February or 3 June 1488 – 28 March 1563) was a Swiss music theorist, poet, humanist, philosopher and cartographer. He was born in Mollis (in the canton of Glarus, hence his name) and died in Freiburg im Breisgau.

==Biography==
Glarean was born as Heinrich Loriti (also spelled Loritti, Loretti, Loritis, Loris, Loritz and Loritus) in Mollis in Canton Glarus to a politician. As a boy, he took care of cattle and received a good education. After a thorough early training in music, Glarean enrolled in the University of Cologne, where he studied theology, philosophy, and mathematics as well as music. It was in Cologne where he held a poem as a tribute to Emperor Maximilian I. Since 1514 he was a teacher for Greek and Latin in Basel, where he met Erasmus and the two humanists became lifelong friends. He shortly was a lecturer at the University of Pavia for a few months in 1515, but returned to Basel due to the Battle of Marignano between Switzerland and France.

In the early stages of the reformation, Glarean, like Erasmus, had considerable sympathy with Martin Luther&#x27;s criticisms of church abuses and scholastic teaching methods. When the break with Rome became inevitable in 1521-1522, however, Glarean and Erasmus both remained faithful to the Church of Rome. Glarean broke off contacts with his fellow-countryman Zwingli, with whom he had been in correspondence since 1508, and with Oswald Myconius, a former schoolmate.

===Music===
Glarean&#x27;s first publication on music, a modest volume entitled &quot;Isagoge in musicen&quot;, was printed in 1515 by Johann Froben. In it he discusses the basic elements of music; probably it was used for teaching. In late 1515 a treatise on latin poetry of him was printed by Adam Petri. But his most famous book, and one of the most famous and influential works on music theory written during the Renaissance, was the &quot;Dodecachordon&quot;, which he published in Basel in 1547. This massive work includes writings on philosophy and biography in addition to music theory, and includes no less than 120 complete compositions by composers of the preceding generation (including Josquin, Ockeghem, Obrecht, Isaac and many others). In three parts, it begins with a study of Boethius, who wrote extensively on music in the sixth century; it traces the use of the musical modes in plainsong (e.g. Gregorian chant) and monophony; and it closes with an extended study of the use of modes in polyphony.

The most significant feature of the &quot;Dodecachordon&quot; (literally, &quot;12-stringed instrument&quot;) is Glarean&#x27;s proposal that there are actually twelve modes, not eight, as had long been assumed, for instance in the works of the contemporary theorist Pietro Aron. The additional four modes included authentic and plagal forms of Aeolian (modes 9 and 10) and Ionian (modes 11 and 12) — the modes equivalent to minor and major scales, respectively. Glarean went so far as to say that the Ionian mode was the one most frequently used by composers in his day.

The influence of his work was immense. Many later theorists, including Zarlino, accepted the twelve modes, and though the distinction between plagal and authentic forms of the modes is no longer of contemporary interest (reducing the number from twelve to six), Glarean&#x27;s explanation of the musical modes remains current today.

===Geography===

Glarean&#x27;s most important published work on geography was &quot;De Geographia Liber&quot; (Basel, 1527). This gives a representation of the universe derived from Ptolemy&#x27;s system, with the spherical earth at the centre and concentric spheres surrounding it carrying the celestial bodies. Eclipses are illustrated with diagrams. Latitude and longitude are defined, and the effects of the incident angle of the sun at different latitudes on climate explained. The use of the astrolabe is described. Then follow chapters on different regions of the world, starting with Ireland (Hibernia) and ending with America, which is named along with its discovers, Columbus of Genoa, and Americus Vesputius.

Early in the twentieth century, a manuscript of the &quot;Geographia&quot; was discovered in England. This dates from about 1510, so considerably earlier than the published book, and contains, in addition to the published text, five hand-drawn maps. Of special interest are two, of the northern and southern hemispheres, which use the Azimuthal equidistant projection. These are the earliest existing maps to use this projection, although it was described earlier by the Persian scholar al-Biruni. Charles Close described the discovery of the manuscript in 1905, and his account was published with a fasimile of one of the maps. The original manuscript and maps are now in the John Carter Brown Library. The northern hemisphere map is clearly based on the Waldseemüller world map of 1507, the first map to name America, and also one of the first to show America as a separate continent, rather than being attached to Asia.

Glarean&#x27;s other work of note is the &quot;Helvetiae Descriptio&quot;, a patriotic poem on the history and people of Switzerland. This was first published in 1514, and then re-issued with a commentary by Oswald Myconius in 1519.

<text>Mary Russell is a fictional character and the protagonist of the Mary Russell &amp; Sherlock Holmes mystery series by American author Laurie R. King. She first appears in the novel &quot;The Beekeeper&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;.

Written over a period of over three decades, King&#x27;s novels are portrayals of a succession of memoirs written and compiled apparently by an aged Mary Russell. A fictional note from the editor (and signed by King) tells readers of a mysterious occurrence wherein a collection of written accounts was anonymously delivered to the unsuspecting novelist; the note ends with a plea for information from anyone with information on the identity of Mary Russell.

The stories are set between 1915 and the late 1920s, mainly in Britain but extending to Palestine, North India, the United States, Japan, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Morocco, Italy, and Romania. They begin in Sussex, England, when 15-year-old Mary Russell (born 2 January 1900) meets a man in his mid-50s who she realizes is Sherlock Holmes, the famous detective of Baker Street, now retired to the country and beekeeping as a hobby. Holmes remains throughout the series as a secondary main character, first as Russell&#x27;s mentor and father figure, and later as her husband and detecting partner. Laurie R. King said of her choice of protagonist, &quot;I did not write Sherlock Holmes stories, I wrote Mary Russell stories&quot;.

Most of the novels are first-person, with &quot;Locked Rooms&quot;, &quot;The Language of Bees&quot; and &quot;God of the Hive&quot; being exceptions, with long passages written in third-person. This technique also serves to underscore and solidify themes in the first two novels. The third, &quot;God of the Hive&quot; (2010) is primarily written with Mary’s first-person narrative, but included various third-person narratives of several characters.

Books 1, 2, and 5 cover seven years of Mary’s life from age 15 to 21, while later books in the series take place between ages 21 through 27. In &quot;Castle Shade&quot;, she is 25 years old.

In 2000, Monica Dolan starred as Russell in a 4-part BBC Radio drama of &quot;The Beekeeper&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, with James Fox playing Holmes.

==Appearances==
&quot;Beekeeping for Beginners&quot; is a novella released in 2011 that introduces new fans to the series. &quot;Mary Russell Companion&quot; is a compendium released on May 1, 2014 that introduces new fans to the fictional character.
#&quot;The Beekeeper&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; opens in early April 1915, about eight months after the opening of the First World War, when young Mary Russell stumbles, literally, across retired detective Sherlock Holmes on the Sussex or South Downs. Russell impresses Holmes with her powers of deduction, and he begins to train her informally as his protégé. She takes on increasing responsibilities. The training becomes vitally important when Russell is caught up in an old enemy&#x27;s vendetta against Holmes. The volume closes in August 1919.
#&quot;A Monstrous Regiment of Women&quot; takes place from Christmas 1920 to February 1921. Russell becomes involved in a Christian feminist movement concerned with philanthropy and political activism. When three wealthy followers are found to have died under mysterious circumstances after willing their fortunes to the cause, Russell and Holmes are drawn into a deeper mystery. A sub-plot deals with the deepening relationship between Russell and Holmes. The title is a reference to the 16th century pamphlet &quot;The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstruous Regiment of Women&quot;.
#&quot;A Letter of Mary&quot; is set two years after the events of &quot;Monstrous Regiment&quot; and the Holmes-Russell marriage. It begins in August 1923 and concludes a month later. A first-century manuscript surfaces that would turn Christianity on its ear, and its discoverer, a friend of Russell and Holmes, turns up dead. While they investigate the death, they must also evade those who are looking for the manuscript.
#&quot;The Moor&quot; closely follows its predecessor, from end September or early October 1923 until early November 1923. It takes the partnership out to Dartmoor, the location of the Conan Doyle mystery, &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;. Another hound is stalking the night, and they must discover how and why. Russell meets Holmes&#x27; old acquaintance, the real-life Rev. Sabine Baring-Gould, the squire of Lew Trenchard, when he asks their help in ridding the Moor of the ghostly hound.
#&quot;O Jerusalem&quot; returns to the close of 1918 and recounts in greater detail the couple&#x27;s six-week sojourn to Palestine which was glossed over in &quot;The Beekeeper&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;. Working with two of Mycroft&#x27;s agents, Mahmoud and Ali Hazr, the partners seek out spies in post-World War I Palestine.
#&quot;Justice Hall&quot; takes up immediately following the conclusion of &quot;The Moor&quot;, and covers events to Christmas 1923. Two friends reappear in England, their former lives now revealed. They are brought back to the life they left behind by a sudden succession to a dukedom. Russell and Holmes help search for one of the Duke&#x27;s nephews, so he can pass on the coronet and return to his preferred life abroad. While there, the pair dig into the past to discover the truth behind the Duke&#x27;s other nephew&#x27;s mysterious wartime death.
#&quot;The Game&quot; In the early days of 1924, Russell and Holmes are given an urgent task by his brother Mycroft: to find a British spy gone missing along India&#x27;s northwest frontier, where men are dying and trouble is brewing. The spy is one whom Holmes knows from his travels in India long ago, under the name Sigurson - Kimball O&#x27;Hara, known to the world by the name Rudyard Kipling called him, Kim.
#&quot;Locked Rooms&quot; Setting sail from their adventures in India during the spring of 1924, Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes first visit Japan and then turn their faces toward San Francisco. The time has come to close up the house and business interests she inherited on the death of her family, ten years before. But disturbing dreams and painful memories make the visit more difficult than she expected, and Holmes suspects that there are dark secrets in his wife&#x27;s past that even she is not aware of. A young Dashiell Hammett makes an extended cameo appearance.
#&quot;The Language of Bees&quot; Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes return home to the Sussex coast in August 1924 and find an entire colony of Holmes&#x27; bees has disappeared, but soon have a bigger mystery to solve. They are enlisted to find the missing wife and child of Damian Adler, whom they crossed paths with earlier when he was accused of murder. As their investigation brings the couple into contact with many different types of madness, Russell begins to believe that Holmes may be protecting the killer they are after.
#&quot;The God of the Hive&quot; The adventure picks up directly from the previous book&#x27;s cliff-hanger ending, as Russell, Holmes, and their companions have been forced to split up in an attempt to make their way back to London, and safety. However, the world has become a dangerous and uncertain place in their absence, with deadly conspiracy so deeply entrenched in the highest echelons of government that even Mycroft is prevented from rendering assistance. New foes threaten the company at all sides, yet in the process a modern-day Robin Goodfellow emerges to lend aid to Mary and her kin.
#&quot;Pirate King&quot; Set in the autumn of 1924, a few months after the previous four books. Mary Russell is now 24, and her husband, the retired consulting detective, is in his early 60s, but retains excellent general health, both physically and mentally. Mary Russell is persuaded (&quot;inveigled&quot; may be a more apt word) by her brother-in-law Mycroft into infiltrating an English silent-film company suspected of having criminal sidelines. In an undercover role, she - assisted by Holmes, of course - joins the film crew in Portugal on its latest grand project, a silent-film version of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Pirates of Penzance&quot;- but with real pirates.
#&quot;Garment of Shadows&quot; At the end of 1924, Mary Russell and her husband Sherlock Holmes are separated by a shocking circumstance in a perilous part of the world, each racing against time to prevent an explosive catastrophe that could clothe them both in shrouds. In a strange room in Morocco, Mary Russell is trying to solve a pressing mystery: Who am I? She has awakened with shadows in her mind, blood on her hands, and soldiers pounding at the door. Meanwhile, Holmes is pulled by two old friends and a distant relation into the growing war between France, Spain, and the Rif Revolt led by Emir Abd el-Krim - who may be a North African Robin Hood, or simply a power-mad chieftain. The shadows of war are drawing over the ancient city of Fez and as Holmes searches for Russell, and Russell searches for herself, each tries to crack deadly parallel puzzles before it&#x27;s too late for them, for Africa, and for the peace of Europe.
#&quot;Dreaming Spies&quot; Takes place between the events of &quot;The Game&quot; and &quot;Locked Rooms&quot;. After a lengthy case in India &quot;(The Game)&quot; Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes are on the steamer Thomas Carlyle, bound for Japan. Though they’re not the vacationing types, Russell is looking forward to a change of focus—not to mention the chance of traveling to a place Holmes has not visited before. Aboard the ship, intrigue stirs almost immediately. Between an aristocrat Holmes suspects of being a blackmailer and the lithe young Japanese woman who befriends Russell, the couple have plenty to keep their minds occupied. From the Imperial Palace in Tokyo to Oxford’s venerable Bodleian Library, Russell and Holmes race to solve a mystery with enormous implications of international extortion, espionage, and shocking secrets that, if revealed, could spark revolution—and topple an empire.
#&quot;The Murder of Mary Russell&quot; Focuses on Mrs Hudson&#x27;s story and how her past comes back to haunt Russell and Holmes.
#&quot;Mary Russell&#x27;s War, and other stories of suspense&quot; is a collection of short stories set at various times.
#&quot;Island of the Mad&quot; Set in June 1925, directly after &quot;The Murder of Mary Russell&quot;, and takes Russell and Holmes to Venice tracking a missing woman.
#&quot;Riviera Gold&quot; Set in the summer of 1925, Russell and Holmes happen arrive at the Côte d&#x27;Azur and find themselves pulled between the young and the old, hot sun and cool jazz, new friendships and old loyalties.
#&quot;Castle Shade&quot; Set in 1925, Russell and Holmes come to the aid of Queen Marie of Roumania, granddaughter to Queen Victoria.
#&quot;The Lantern&#x27;s Dance&quot; Set in 1925, Russell and Holmes look forward to spending time with the famous artist Damian Adler, and his family in the French countryside.

==Biography==

===Early life===
The daughter of a British Jewish mother and an American millionaire father, Russell spent time in Boston and San Francisco as well as England while growing up. Her mother raised her in the Jewish tradition and she continues to consider herself a Jew as an adult. When she is fourteen, Russell&#x27;s parents and younger brother are killed in an automobile accident outside San Francisco in which she herself is seriously injured. Russell blames herself for the accident and undergoes psychoanalysis during her recovery, continuing to have nightmares for years afterward. After she recovers, Russell returns to her mother&#x27;s farm in Sussex under the guardianship of her much-hated and penurious maternal aunt, who intends to live well off Russell&#x27;s fortune until Mary reaches her majority. It is here where, as well as meeting Holmes, Russell prepares for, and eventually passes, the entrance exams to Oxford University, where she reads chemistry and theology.

===Relationships===
In addition to Holmes, who acts a mentor and father substitute early in their relationship and eventually becomes her husband, Russell becomes close to other characters from the Holmes canon: she considers Mrs. Hudson, who has accompanied Holmes to Sussex as his housekeeper, to be a mother figure, and she refers to Dr. Watson as &quot;Uncle John&quot; and Mycroft Holmes as &quot;Brother Mycroft.&quot; She is also close to her farm manager Patrick and tends to make friends easily when she wants to.

Russell also encounters a number of historical figures and fictional characters (who are treated as &quot;real&quot; within the novels) over the course of her adventures. In addition to meetings with Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s Kim, Dashiell Hammett, and Sabine Baring-Gould as described above, she has met T. E. Lawrence, J. R. R. Tolkien and Edmund Allenby. She and Holmes are also implied to be friends with fellow fictional detective Peter Wimsey, who makes a cameo appearance in &quot;A Letter of Mary&quot;.

===Skills and physical attributes===
Russell has a keen mind and is an ardent feminist. She is a serious scholar in theology and works on a book-length manuscript, which is published. She reads and speaks many modern and classical languages, including Ancient Greek and Latin (learned for her theology degree), Hebrew, French, German, Spanish, Arabic, and Hindi. She studies the Japanese language and culture in preparation for a trip.

Under Holmes&#x27;s tutelage she has developed a variety of unlikely talents. She has extremely accurate aim with firearms, throwing knives, and even rocks. She can play the tin whistle, juggle, do sleight-of-hand, pick locks, and hypnotize others. She can ride, drive, and is well schooled in martial arts - particularly in the art of falling without being hurt. She has exceptional balance and strong climbing skills. She is an adequate, but not gifted, cook, although she is skilled at making Turkish coffee. She is well read and spends a great deal of time out of doors in the course of her investigations, but she is not a naturalist.

Like her husband, Russell is tall (5&quot;11&quot;) and slim, with blonde hair and blue eyes. She is not a naturally tidy person and is easily disheveled - a disadvantage for someone who is frequently sleuthing in wet, mucky, or dirty locales, then forced to make a drawing room appearance. She is quite unconventional - not a surprise for a young woman who married an older famous eccentric. She prefers trousers and functional clothes, although often dons the traditional tweed skirts and sensible shoes of a female British naturalist.

She only rarely accepts the title &quot;Mrs. Holmes&quot; and goes by her given name &quot;Mary Russell&quot;, which she uses with the title &quot;Miss&quot; (i.e., &quot;Miss Russell&quot;). She wears a gold band on her right hand. This makes her status ambiguous - people she meets may think she is wearing a ring for sentimental reasons, or perhaps that she is married but from another culture, but most likely that she is one of the many women widowed during World War I. She wears her hair long, until it is cropped for a disguise in &quot;The Game&quot;.

She is very nearsighted, which can be an irritation on a case. She is often concerned that her somewhat delicate wire frame glasses will crack (though she does not carry a spare pair) and is frequently hampered when they fog up or are spattered with rain. She is able to cope with the uglier side of her profession but is shaken by violence, death, and corpses. She enjoys hot baths, sleeping late, and reading. She dislikes the harshness of electric lights.

==Inspiration==
Laurie R. King has described Russell as &quot;what Sherlock Holmes would look like if Holmes, the Victorian detective, were (a) a woman, (b) of the Twentieth century, and (c) interested in theology&quot;. King has a graduate degree in Old Testament theology that has doubtless informed Russell&#x27;s own theological pursuits.

<text>111 Ate is a main-belt asteroid discovered by the German-American astronomer C. H. F. Peters on August 14, 1870, and named after Ate, the goddess of mischief and destruction in Greek mythology. In the Tholen classification system, it is categorized as a carbonaceous C-type asteroid, while the Bus asteroid taxonomy system lists it as an Ch asteroid.

Two stellar occultations by Ate were observed in 2000, two months apart. Its occultation of the star HIP 2559 was used to determine a chord length of 125.6 ± 7.2 km through the asteroid, giving a lower bound on the maximum dimension. During 2000, 111 Ate was observed by radar from the Arecibo Observatory. The return signal matched an effective diameter of 135 ± 15 km. The estimated size of this asteroid is 143 km, making it one of the larger asteroids.

Based upon an irregular light curve generated from photometric observations of this asteroid at Pulkovo Observatory, it has a rotation period of 22.072 ± 0.001 hours and varies in brightness by 0.12 ± 0.01 in magnitude.

<text>112 Iphigenia is a fairly large and exceedingly dark main-belt asteroid. It is classified as a C-type asteroid, and therefore probably has a primitive carbonaceous composition. It was discovered by German-American astronomer C. H. F. Peters on September 19, 1870, and named after Iphigenia, a princess sacrificed by her father in Greek mythology. The orbital elements for 112 Iphigenia were published by German astronomer Friedrich Tietjen in 1871.

This body is orbiting the Sun with a period of 3.80 years and an eccentricity of 0.13. The orbital plane is inclined by 2.6° to the plane of the ecliptic. 112 Iphigenia has a cross-section diameter of ~72 km. Photometric observations of this asteroid during 2007 at the Observatorio Astronómico de Mallorca were used to create a light curve plot, which was published in 2010. This showed a relatively long synodic rotation period of hours (1.3 days) and a brightness variation of magnitude during each cycle. These findings agree with independent results reported in 2008, which gave a period of hours.

<text>The Kings River is a tributary of the Quinn River, about long, in northwestern Nevada and south-central Oregon in the United States. It drains a remote arid area of the northwestern Great Basin.

==Description==
The river rises in northern Humboldt County, Nevada, west of Disaster Peak in The Granites, part of the Trout Creek Mountains, near the Oregon state line. Flowing northwest, it crosses briefly into Harney County, Oregon, then turns sharply south and re-enters Humboldt County for the rest of its course. It flows generally south between the Bilk Creek Mountains on the right (west) and the Montana Mountains, then the Double H Mountains on the left. It joins the Quinn River from the north at Quinn River Lakes. The Quinn River flows southwest from the lake to end in a sink in the Black Rock Desert west of Winnemucca.

<text>The Ireland men&#x27;s national rugby league team, known as the Wolfhounds, is organised by Rugby League Ireland and represents the entire isle of Ireland in international rugby league. The representative team is composed largely of players of Irish descent who compete in the Super League as well as the Australasian National Rugby League. Ireland is also represented by an [[Ireland A national rugby league team|Ireland A]] side, which is made up of players from the Irish domestic competition.

Since Ireland began competing in international rugby league in 1995, it has participated in the 1995 Rugby League Emerging Nations Tournament, the 1996 Super League World Nines, and five Rugby League World Cups – 2000, 2008, 2013, 2017 and 2021. They have also competed in the Rugby League European Nations Cup. 
Although, the island of Ireland is separate from the island of Great Britain, Irish players such as Cork-born Brian Carney have in the past been selected to play for the Great Britain side.

==History==

The seeds of modern-day Rugby League in Ireland were sown in 1989 when Brian Corrigan founded the Dublin Blues Rugby League, a club that was primarily used by union players to keep fit during the summer by playing matches against touring British teams. In 1995 the British RFL established Ireland&#x27;s first development officer and later that year Ireland played against the United States in Washington on St Patricks Day with Ireland winning 24–22. Wigan Warriors player Joe Lydon came on as a substitute despite also serving as the manager. Huddersfield Giants coach Terry Flanagan and former Great Britain Student international Niel Wood were the joint coaches. In August 1995 Ireland beat Scotland at the RDS Arena in Dublin as a curtain raiser to the charity shield match between Leeds Rhinos and Wigan Warriors. The matches were played before an attendance of 5,716, a record for an international rugby league match on Irish soil. Former Great Britain player Des Foy played for Ireland. Following their appearance at the 1995 Emerging Nations Tournament, they were invited to the Super League World Nines in Fiji where they finished 8th.

===Flags and anthems===

The Irish rugby league team is one of many Irish teams that draws its players from across the island of Ireland. It utilises the Four Provinces Flag of Ireland and the all-island anthem, &quot;Ireland&#x27;s Call&quot;. Unlike the Irish rugby union team, the Irish rugby league team neither plays Amhrán na bhFiann, the national anthem of the Irish state, nor God Save the King/Queen, the national anthem of Northern Ireland, in addition to Ireland&#x27;s Call when playing at home.

=== 1995 Emerging Nations Tournament ===
Ireland were included in the tournament held in England and were placed in Group B alongside Moldova and Morocco. Ireland beat Moldova 48–24 before beating Morocco 42–6 to progress to the final. In the final Ireland lost 6–22 to the Cook Islands at Gigg Lane in Bury. Coached by Terry Flanagan, Ireland&#x27;s squad included professionals Des Foy and Martin Crompton in an otherwise domestic based squad.

===2000 World Cup===
1997 saw more England-based Super League players making themselves available by use of the grandparent rule. The Irish team improved its standards but this development gave less opportunity for Irish-based players to get a chance to play. However, Irish-based players were included in the Irish squad for the triangular tournaments in 1998 against France and Scotland and 1999 against Scotland and Wales. 
Their success was enough to earn a place in the 2000 World Cup. Finishing top of their group, the Irish eventually lost 26–16 to England in the quarter-finals, but the performance set the scene for future developments in Ireland.

===2008 World Cup===
Ireland were drawn against Lebanon and Russia in Europe&#x27;s 2008 Rugby League World Cup Qualifying Pool Two. Ireland topped the group with a 16–16 draw with Lebanon at Dewsbury on 2 November 2007. The draw meant Ireland qualified for the 2008 World Cup on points difference from Lebanon as both nations gained the same number of group points.

At the 2008 World Cup in Australia, Ireland were in Group C along with Tonga and Samoa. They lost to Tonga on 27 October in Parramatta, Sydney, but were victorious against Samoa, again in Parramatta, on 5 November and topped the group on points difference. As the group winners, they played Fiji, winners of Group B, for a chance to qualify for the semi-final. Fiji won 30–14 eliminating Ireland.

===2013 World Cup ===
For the 2013 World Cup Ireland were drawn in group A alongside Australia, England and 2008 World Cup rivals Fiji. Ireland was granted automatic entry to the tournament due to their strong showing in the 2008 World Cup. Ireland lost all three group matches including a 0–50 defeat to eventual champions Australia in front of 5,021 fans at Thomond Park.

===2017 World Cup===

Ireland kicked off their campaign with a shock 36–12 win over Italy in Cairns. In the next pool match Ireland lost a narrow match to PNG 14–6 with PNG needing a 78th minute try to win the game. Ireland&#x27;s final pool match was against Wales in Perth where they ran out comfortable winners 34–6. Ireland did not progress to the next round of the tournament despite winning more games than Lebanon or Samoa who qualified for the last 8.

=== 2021 World Cup ===

Ireland started 2021 Rugby League World Cup qualification campaign in the 2018 European Championship, where they finished third with a win against Scotland and two losses against France and Wales. Ireland&#x27;s third-place finish required them to participate in the 2019 European play-off tournament to ensure qualification. Here they managed to achieve two wins against Italy and Spain, leading to their World Cup qualification. Ireland were drawn into Group C, alongside New Zealand, Lebanon and Jamaica. In April 2022 Offaly-born Ged Corcoran took over from Stuart Littler for the World Cup campaign. Ireland finished the tournament with a 1–2 record beating Jamaica in their opener, before losing to Lebanon and New Zealand.

=== Demotion to affiliate status and 2026 World Cup ineligibility ===
In March 2024, the International Rugby League deemed that Ireland had been non-compliant with the terms of the IRL membership policy and consequently would be reclassified as an affiliate member. This decision also made Ireland ineligible to participate in qualifiers for the 2026 Rugby League World Cup.

<doc id="738865" wikidata="Q136256" url="?curid=738865" title="113 Amalthea">
<text>113 Amalthea () is a stony Florian asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 12 March 1871, by German astronomer Robert Luther at the Bilk Observatory in Düsseldorf, Germany. The elongated S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 9.95 hours. It was named after Amalthea from Greek mythology. A purported satellite of Amalthea was announced in July 2017, but was later found to be a software error in July 2021.

== Description ==

Amalthea is thought to be a fragment from the mantle of a Vesta-sized, 300–600 km diameter parent body that broke up around one billion years ago, with the other major remnant being 9 Metis. The spectrum of Amalthea reveals the presence of the mineral olivine, a relative rarity in the asteroid belt.

Based on observations made during a stellar occultation by Amalthea of a 10th-magnitude star on 14 March 2017, it was announced in July 2017 that the asteroid has a small, 5-kilometer-sized satellite, provisionally designated &quot;S/2017 (113) 1&quot;. However, the satellite was later retracted as a software-reduction coding error on 17 July 2021. The occultation also indicated that Amalthea has a distinctly elongated shape.

One of Jupiter&#x27;s inner small satellites, unrelated to 113 Amalthea, is also called Amalthea, as is a (apparently fictional) small Arjuna asteroid in Neal Stephenson&#x27;s 2015 novel &quot;Seveneves&quot;.

KCTS-TV is the primary PBS member station for the Seattle–Tacoma market alongside Tacoma-licensed KBTC-TV (channel 28), owned by Bates Technical College. Through PBS&#x27;s Program Differentiation Plan (PDP), KCTS-TV carries the majority (75%) of the network&#x27;s programs, with KBTC-TV carrying the remaining 25%. It also services parts of British Columbia, Canada.

Originally owned and operated by the University of Washington, KCTS-TV became a community licensee in 1987. In 2015, it was announced that the station would merge with Crosscut.com to form Cascade Public Media.

KYVE (channel 47) in Yakima operates as a semi-satellite of KCTS-TV, serving as the PBS member station for the western portion of the Yakima–Tri-Cities market. KYVE&#x27;s transmitter is located on Ahtanum Ridge.

==History==

KCTS was founded by the University of Washington (UW), the station&#x27;s original licensee. It was a sister station to KUOW-FM, which UW put on the air in 1951. It was originally to have gone on the air under the callsign KUOW-TV, but it instead assumed the callsign KCTS, meaning Community Television Service, to avoid singling out a member of its initial sponsoring group. Sponsors at the time included UW, Seattle Public Schools, King County Public Schools, Seattle University, Seattle Pacific College, and the Seattle Public Library. A studio for KCTS was set up on the UW campus at 15th Avenue NE and NE Campus Parkway, with equipment donated by KING-TV owner Dorothy Bullitt.

The station aired its first test pattern on November 18, 1954; a fire at its studio the following day caused extensive damage to its equipment, but suppliers expedited shipments of replacement equipment such that they all arrived within a week after the fire, avoiding a potential delay to its planned regular programming. KCTS began broadcasting at 7 p.m. on December 7, first airing a five-minute program preview hosted by UW professor and program director Milo Ryan before switching to an abridged performance of Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Elijah&quot; by the Seattle Pacific College Choir. Initially, it aired only two preview programs weekly; however, regular programming did not commence until nearly a month later on January 5, 1955, with the inaugural program featuring Governor Arthur B. Langlie as principal speaker. It had three telecast periods throughout the afternoon and evening during weekdays.

During the 1950s and 1960s, KCTS primarily supplied classroom instructional programs used in Washington State&#x27;s K–12 schools, plus National Educational Television (NET) programs. Outside of schoolrooms, KCTS&#x27;s audience among the general public was somewhat limited, and most programming was in black-and-white until the mid-1970s (although the station did install color capability in 1967). In 1970, NET was absorbed into the newly created Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), which commenced broadcasting on October 5. As a PBS member station, KCTS began offering a vastly enhanced scope of programming for the general public, including British programming.

Thanks to a major fundraising drive during the mid-1980s, KCTS moved to new studio space on the Seattle Center campus in October 1986 and would remain there until 2024. In 1987, UW spun off KCTS, and the station became a community licensee, thus separating it from KUOW-FM.

KCTS is seen throughout southwestern British Columbia on local cable systems, as well as across Canada on the Bell Satellite TV and Shaw Direct satellite providers, as well as on many other Canadian cable TV systems. By 1996, a third of KCTS&#x27;s audience resided in British Columbia; after it was removed from its channel number (9) on basic cable systems in the province, donations declined by $1.2 million. KCTS continues to receive financial support from its Canadian audience, which was processed through the Pacific Coast Public Television Association until its dissolution in 2017.

KCTS switched to a digital transmission signal from its Capitol Hill tower in March 1999, becoming the third television station in the Seattle area to make the transition. The station had been an early adopter of high-definition television programming and used its new digital signal to simulcast several programs. In January 2016, as part of a broader strategy to redefine itself as a content provider for various platforms other than television, the name of the licensee, KCTS Television became Cascade Public Media; its properties included KCTS-TV, Crosscut, a non-profit daily news site, and Spark Public. Cascade Public Media currently consists of KCTS, Crosscut and Piranha Partners.

In July 2022, Cascade Public Media purchased Childhaven&#x27;s longtime facility in First Hill for $23 million and announced that it would move its operations there by the end of 2023; the organization stated on its website that the city of Seattle declined to renew the 40-year ground lease for the Seattle Center facility. It retained architectural firm JPC Architects, general contractor Abbott Construction, and project manager OAC Services as part of a capital campaign to purchase and renovate the property.

In October 2023, KCTS announced that it and Crosscut would merge under the new unified brand of Cascade PBS. It also announced plans for a new streaming app, expanding on a service that launched in 2020, that would be used by other PBS member stations. KCTS and Crosscut moved into the First Hill facility in January 2024, with both subsequently adopting the Cascade PBS name on March 1.

==KYVE history==

In 1994, KCTS merged with KYVE, which has served central Washington since November 1, 1962. However, this was not the first time that the two stations had partnered together; during the early 1960s KYVE&#x27;s engineers switched to and from KCTS&#x27;s signal until the station&#x27;s owners, the Yakima Board of Education, got enough funding for the station to be self-supporting. The station became a community licensee in 1984, but found the going difficult until its merger with KCTS. KYVE did produce a few local programs, including the &quot;KYVE Apple Bowl&quot; with host Tony Leita, a high school quiz competition; &quot;Northwest Outdoors&quot; with Wally Pease, an outdoors program; and &quot;Country Roads with Gwyn Gilmore&quot;, a showcase of country music videos.

During the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, some programs included a combined &quot;KCTS/KYVE&quot; visual bug in the lower-right corner of the screen, indicating they were simulcast to both markets. However, since the early 2000s, KYVE has largely been a straight simulcast of KCTS, so the screen bug was dropped. Combined, the two stations serve 2.4 million people, accounting for almost two-thirds of Washington state&#x27;s population.

Its former studios were located at Braeburn Hall at Yakima Valley Community College. But since the start of the millennium, local origination was severely reduced, and eventually, Braeburn Hall was torn down. KYVE later moved to a small office on 2nd Street (at the bottom of the Larson Building). This office is now home to the ticket office and administration for the Yakima Valley Pippins baseball team, and aside from the Ahtanum Ridge transmitter and the legal hourly station ID, KYVE no longer has any presence in Yakima.

==Programming==
KCTS is perhaps best known for producing/distributing the popular PBS Kids show &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy&quot;, as well as other programs such as &quot;Students by Nature&quot; (not a PBS-distributed program), &quot;The Miracle Planet&quot;, cooking shows by Nick Stellino, &quot;Chefs A&#x27; Field&quot;, and the annual televised high school academic competition &quot;KYVE Apple Bowl&quot;.

KCTS was among a number of PBS member stations to air the controversial &quot;Sugartime!&quot; episode of &quot;Postcards from Buster&quot;, a spinoff of &quot;Arthur&quot; about a cartoon rabbit named Buster Baxter, who travels the country with his father and interacts with children from different cultures and in different family structures. The episode had been removed from PBS Kids Go!&#x27;s national broadcast schedule after PBS received a critical letter from then-newly-appointed Education Secretary Margaret Spellings, who was upset that Buster was visiting a Vermont family headed by two women. WGBH, the Boston-based PBS affiliate and original producer of the program, subsequently made the episode available to stations that still wished to air it on an individual basis.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The stations&#x27; signals are multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KCTS-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 9, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 41 to VHF channel 9.

<doc id="738878" wikidata="Q1025802" url="?curid=738878" title="Cahuachi">
<text>Cahuachi, in Peru, was a major ceremonial center of the Nazca culture, based from about in the coastal area of Peru&#x27;s central Andes. It overlooked some of the Nazca lines. The Italian archaeologist Giuseppe Orefici has been excavating at the site for the past few decades. The site contains over 40 mounds topped with adobe structures. The huge architectural complex covers (1.5 km²) at 365 meters above sea level. The American archeologist Helaine Silverman has also conducted long term, multi-stage research and written about the full context of Nazca society at Cahuachi, published in a lengthy study in 1993.

Scholars once thought the site was the capital of the Nazca state but have determined that the permanent population was quite small. They believe that it was a pilgrimage center, whose population increased greatly preceding and during major ceremonial events. New research has suggested that 40 of the mounds were natural hills modified to appear as artificial constructions. Support for the pilgrimage theory comes from archaeological evidence of sparse population at Cahuachi, the spatial patterning of the site, and ethnographic evidence from the Virgin of Yauca pilgrimage in the nearby Ica Valley.

Looting is the greatest problem facing the site today. Most of the burial sites surrounding Cahuachi were not known until recently and are tempting targets for looters.

==Geographic and environmental overview==
The Cahuachi site is located near the south coast of Peru, and found in the Nazca Valley. Within the Nazca Valley is the Río Grande de Nazca drainage system and is where the Nazca culture developed. The area is ecologically classified as “pre-mountain desert formation.” There is a very important ecological transition going on within the Río Grande de Nazca drainage system, transitioning from pre-mountain desert zone of the coast, to chuapiyunga (meaning &quot;between hot and cold&quot;) up towards the highlands, and east of the town Nazca the transition to true &quot;yunga&quot; begins. Yunga refers to the Quechua Yungas meaning &quot;warm valley&quot;. The site itself can be found on the southern side of the Nazca River, one of ten major tributaries that form the Río Grande de Nazca drainage system. The greater Nazca Valley drainage area is very dry in the summer and extremely hot. Precipitation varies between none and 125 mm; daytime summer temperatures average 21.3 °C.

To the north and south Cahuachi faces two pampas, or flat plain-like terrain: Pampa de San José and Pampa de Atarco, and on these plains is where the famous ground-drawings of the Nazca desert are found. The Río Grande region&#x27;s soils are available for irrigation agriculture with limitations. Cahuachi is located off of the valley bottom of the treeless hills and terraces beneath Pampa de Atarco, and has been known to be subject to strong winds that are capable of becoming sandstorms. It is on these treeless hills that formed the core majority of artificial constructions at Cahuachi. There is, also present, sporadic rains and cyclical floods which result in water erosion of the terrain, which made some parts of the valley uninhabitable, which influenced the settlement pattern of Cahuachi.

Cahuachi lies over brown barren river terraces that are characterized by hills, above the bottom of the valley. Hills were modified in various ways to create civic or ceremonial centers.

==History of research at Cahuachi==
Frabee was the first to actually acknowledge and excavate the site of Cahuachi in the Nazca region in 1922. The following researchers have also studied and interpreted the site: Kroeber (1926), Tello (1927), Doering (1932), Strong (1952–1953), Robinson (1954–1955).

Among the most extensive research done at Cahuachi was the excavations conducted by archaeologist William Strong. Strong was one of the only archaeologists who took a broad approach to the site, contextualizing it within Nasca society and south coast prehistory. He set out to find stratigraphic evidence that would resolve the gap between Paracas and Nasca styles in the region. He also did settlement pattern studies in order to find out the kinds of activities that went on at Cahuachi. William Duncan Strong&#x27;s excavations in the early Nasca site of Cahuachi from 1952–1953 found that the site was composed of temples, cemeteries, and house mounds. Following his findings, other scholars within Peruvian archaeology interpreted the site to have been an urban settlement with residential structures. However, more recent excavations and experiments suggests this to be unlikely.

In the early 1980s, archaeologist Helaine Silverman and Italian architect Giuseppe Orefici conducted intensive and extensive archaeological excavations in several areas of the site. This new research was aimed towards finding and clarifying the real character of the site and of Nasca society. Orefici&#x27;s excavations in 1983 had revealed the evidence ceramic production in the form of an oven; however he has recovered various burial sites, ceremonial drums, and pottery which suggests that the site is indeed a ceremonial center.

Cahuachi is where Helaine Silverman began her dissertation fieldwork on early Nasca society in 1983. She later inferred from her data and analysis how Cahuachi would have functioned as a ceremonial center and its role in state formation and urbanism, within a regional and pan-Andean scope. Silverman&#x27;s data from the excavations and experiments in 1986, strongly support the claim that the site was indeed a ceremonial centre. Through her work and research, Silverman found no evidence of inhabitants or domestic and residential structures indicating it to be an urban settlement. She suggested that the site was used as a ceremonial center where people periodically performed religious activities. By examining the remains of pottery, Silverman also suggested that pottery was taken and was broken at the site as a part of the activities and rituals taking place at that time. The vegetal and faunal remains also indicated that food was brought to the site and immediately consumed there. Later research also indicated the consumption of hallucinogenic beverages at the site.

Excavations and surveys conducted by Giuseppe Orefici indicate that the site was not a permanent domestic habitat. The site contains around 40 archaeological mounds and progressive excavations of the area found that most of these mounds were not used for habitation, but that it was more likely a religious ceremonial setting.

==Chronology and Nasca style pottery==
There is a major emphasis on Nasca style pottery at Cahuachi. Recognized as a discrete style first by Adolf Bastian, Nasca style is a polychrome pottery and is generally noted as having a “south coast” provenance and is named Nasca for its focal regional distribution in the Nasca valley. There are two principal modalities in the decorative style of Nasca pottery: &quot;“Monumental”&quot; and &quot;“proliferous”&quot; (coined terms by Rowe).

Monumental refers to the types of Nasca pottery with so-called realistic designs, while Proliferous describes more “conventionalized motifs” with volutes, rays, and points. Gayton and Kroeber established three categorizable characteristics-shape, color, and design- and based on the relationships between these attributes came up with four chronological phases or “substyles” of Nasca pottery:
Later, came the Dawson seriation which subdivided the Nasca style into nine phases. These are then associated into certain periods and epochs. &quot;Monumental&quot; includes Nasca 1–4 and Gayton and Kroeber&#x27;s Nazca A, while &quot;Proliferous&quot; encompasses the innovation of Nasca 5; and Nasca 6 and 7 pottery and corresponds to Gayton and Kroeber&#x27;s Nazca Y.

Because of the frequency of Nasca 3 pottery and its association with architecture at the site, the conclusion is that Cahuachi is early Intermediate Period of the Ica (south coast ceramic periods). Nasca 1 and 2 are represented at a lesser degree, but are still significantly present as well. One of Strong&#x27;s goals in his research at Cahuachi was &quot;to resolve the temporal relationship between Paracas and Nasca&quot; style pottery, which was still stratigraphically unproven. Stong&#x27;s conclusions were that the ceremonial structures at Cahuachi date to the &quot;middle Nazca culture phase&quot; (Nazca 3), and not late Nazca. Instead, late Nazca dates were only found to be associated with graves. According to , all later scholars are in basic agreement with Strong.

==Agriculture and economy==
Cahuachi is considered a non-urban ceremonial center, meaning that it was never densely occupied and people did not actually live there long-term, this is evidenced by perishable and temporary “wattle and daub-like” structures (not unlike the ones made today) excavated on site. It was more of a pilgrimage or religious destination. So, although for the extensive evidence of Nasca pottery that is used to date the site, and considering the massive specialized culture that goes with it, the evidence for craft specialization and intensive trade and agriculture is understandably limited than if the site were a permanent residence of a large population.

===Agriculture – edible food materials present===
At least 15 species of shellfish remains were found at Cahuachi, as well as one type of echinoderm, and four types of fish. Interesting to note as well, is that the most abundant types of botanical remains found at Cahuachi were also most easily transported such as peanut, and were also locally and seasonally available like the huarango fruit native to the area, and more importantly, Cahuachi. The reason for why there is a limited amount of edible plant remains found here is because Cahuachi was not a permanently inhabited place, so any food that was brought there was kept in small storage and quickly consumed. Other edible foods found at Cahuchi include potato, sweet potato, manioc, beans, squash, and achira. Excavations at the unit 16 wall revealed loose earth and some windblown organic remains found within postholes that had been excavated down to sterile soil. Materials recovered include: Huarango seed, pacae leaf, guayaba seed, and llama excrement. Another excavation at the unit 16 wall of five circular and roughly circular depressions contained, among other things, guinea pig hair, and gourd fragments.

A special food preparation area evidenced by the presence of a corn popper and the ritual importance of corn in the Andes was also found at Cahuachi. Small storage facilities and vessels that would have contained food and drink only sufficient for short visits to the ceremonial center both support the fact that Cahuachi was not permanently inhabited at all times and therefore most likely did not have intensive agriculture at the site itself. That being said, all these remains had to come from somewhere, and so they can be used as evidence that indicates the types of food most popular and abundant in this area at the time. The presence of the food materials and the absence of most of their cultivation within the site of Cahuachi can also be indicative of trade networks within the surrounding communities.

===Agriculture – ritual food materials present===
Among ritual or ceremonial remains recovered through Strong&#x27;s excavations at Cahuachi in unit 2, also known as The Great Temple, were llama remains, bird plumage, as well as other things like fine pottery and panpipes, which he also interpreted as feasting and sacrificial materials. Strong&#x27;s 1957 excavations of a multitude of llama remains on the Great Temple, as well as some rare guinea pig remains at the excavation of Unit 19 are a small indication of the types of animals available in this area. At least 23 guinea pig remains, used as sacrificial offerings, were recovered. All had their heads jerked out of articulation and pristine preservation of their soft tissues allowed Silverman to determine that their undersides had been split open from the neck down, resembling modern-day divination rituals.

Caches of maize, huarango pods, as well as a small concentration of shell were all found at Cahuachi, and are, again, considered to have ritual purposes rather than agricultural significance. At one of the more well-known constructions at Cahuachi is the Room of the Posts. Here, in front of a deep niche, were two cylindrical depressions, resembling postholes, and within them were found ten unworked pieces of Spondylus, a shell sacred in the Andean region. Within a round depression excavated in the room they found a cache of huarango pods. 16 whole pots and hundreds of sherds-all dating to Nasca 8 style- were also found in the room, along with a cache of blue-painted ají peppers, four portable looms, pyroengraved gourd rattles, and plain gourd containers. All were deposited as offerings, which makes sense since this is a ceremonial center. The abundance of the huarango fruit seeds and pods as the site, in both consumable and ritual use, is because it could be grown within the Cahuachi region and therefore was most at hand and used in everyday life, making it life sustaining as well as ritually significant.

All the evidence within this category are relating to ritual and sacrificial purposes rather than direct agricultural practices at Cahuachi. Considering that this was a non-urban center, it seems safe to assume there was no intensive agriculture going on at Cahuachi, and rather any domesticated resource evidence found was brought to Cahuachi from the outside, like nearby cities or towns, and could quite possibly fall more under the category of trade rather than agriculture.

===Economy – trade===
Because Cahuachi was a non-urban ceremonial center there was not a permanent population living long-term within the site. This means that the people who did spend time there, were not there long enough to do things like set up an intensive agricultural system, or contribute to large-scale craft specialization and production. That is not to say that they did not do any of these things, but just not on as large of a scale as an actual city would. Cahuachi was, however, a ceremonial center and more importantly a religious destination, so there were people going to and from the site on a regular basis, developing a sort of &quot;pilgrimage trade&quot; system. Most things, like pottery, food, animals, and other transportable items were brought to Cahuachi by individuals.

Among ritual or ceremonial remains recovered through Strong&#x27;s excavations at Cahuachi in unit 2 were things like fine pottery and panpipes. Not all Nasca pottery was produced at Cahuachi. It is much more likely, especially for the fancy pottery, that it was produced in nearby regional centers where this type of craft specialization was prominent, and then brought to and used at Cahuachi, indicative of trade goings on at Cahuachi rather than craft production.

== Economy: Craft specialization and production ==
=== Economy – textiles ===
Cahuachi&#x27;s role as a ceremonial center has left a major amount of its society&#x27;s material expression of their cosmological beliefs; displaying their beliefs through such material items as textiles, ceramics, and decoration or iconography on these items. In Silverman&#x27;s excavations, many loose threads, unattached three-dimensional embroideries, spun and unspun fiber, and several spindle whorls were all found. Strong also claims to have had found fancy textile remains, possibly used in Nasca funerary shrouds or elite / priestly attire, which would all make sense to the ceremonial center claim at Cahuachi. There is also evidence of the presence of craft quarters in the plaza at Cahuachi. Silverman believes that Cahuachi was “a locus of textile production where the shrouds of those special individuals buried at the site and the elaborate costumes worn by Nasca priests and/or ritual performers were produced.”

The &quot;Great Cloth&quot; The world largest known textile was found entombed in Cahuachi, the Nasca ceremonial and political center in 1952 during excavation led by William Duncan Strong. Unfortunately the excavation method damaged the cloth and now it&#x27;s in four pieces in the collection of the Department of Anthropology at Columbia University. The weft selvage was measured as over 5.5 m, but its original length, only estimated during the excavation, would have been at least 50–60 m. The making of this plain weave cloth would have required an estimated 9 million feet of cotton yarn, which certainly involved highly organized labor force. The careful entombment of the Great Cloth at the largest plaza in an otherwise refuse free, sterile area shows the ritual importance of this textile.

===Economy – pottery===
Ceramic analysis at Cahuachi supports Silverman&#x27;s assertion that Cahuachi was a non-urban ceremonial center because there is a predominance of fine ware rather than plain ware at the site, on the rate of 70% to 30%, which, if you think about it, would be unquestionably reversed if Cahuachi were a permanently inhabited urban area. The majority of plain ware that was found at the site were mainly those used for small-scale storage and burials, then those used for food service.

Fine ware, of ritual significance, was decorated and was used for burials and also included technologically complex panpipes, which is a form of craft specialization. Family-sized cooking pots are rare at the site. Not all Nasca pottery was produced at Cahuachi. It is much more likely, especially for the fine pottery, that it was produced in nearby regional centers where this type of craft specialization was prominent, and then brought to and used at Cahuachi. Again this fact is more indicative of trade goings on at Cahuachi rather than large scale craft production at the site.

==Architecture and artifacts==
Cahuachi&#x27;s architecture and its organization are characteristic of a ceremonial center, and is not urban. At Cahuachi, there are mound and room constructions, a structure called the “Great Temple”, walls that form corridors and passageways, as well as major walls, circular depressions, cylindrical shafts on top of mounds, and kanchas. Kanchas are the bounded open spaces beneath and between mounds and can be defined as a walled field or patio area that does not necessarily insinuate any specific function. The following analyses are largely based on Strong&#x27;s excavations and Silverman&#x27;s survey and reanalysis of the site.

There are about 40 mounds at Cahuachi. Some mounds had rooms on top of them, others did not, some are considered to be “temples,” and still others were used for burials. But furthermore, the majority of the mounds at Cahuachi are overwhelmingly never actual “habitation mounds”. Strong originally classified these mounds as “habitation mounds” but Silverman argues that they are not domestic, which is in keeping with her assertion that Cahuachi was a non-urban ceremonial center. For some examples of the types of mounds at Cahuachi Silverman focuses on cuts and survey of units 5, 6, and 7. The core of unit 5 is a natural hill that was artificially raised through construction and fills. The fill contained bundles and intertwined vegetal fibers, earth, rock, and garbage. The mound has a lot more fill than other mounds because it was artificially raised by placing alternating layers of these vegetal fills. Unit 5 also had several circular depressions, or “cache pits” according to Strong, and only a few contained small amounts of corn cobs and beans. The walls were made of adobe with a sand foundation, and is a construction technique interspersed throughout Cahuachi.

Then more fill was placed behind the wall and in front of the hill. This fill consisted of vegetal fiber, lumps of adobe, sand, a few sherds that prove that the construction of the mound cannot predate Nasca 3 period. Another interesting addition to the fills contents were the presence of offerings like a cache of maize, a large plainware, oxidized olla. The fact that these offerings were made alludes to a ceremonial function of the unit. At unit 6 Strong originally classified the construction as a Middle Nasca temple that was built over a late Paracas domestic dwelling, but the association of the circular pits also dug there with Paracas 10 – Nasca pottery and the dwellings should not necessarily be classified as late Paracas. Here, also, there are adobe walls used to retain fill at this unit, just like at unit 5. There was a wattle and daub wall found underneath, and is a previous occupation of the area that was of a domestic nature, but by occupation stage 3 (after the wattle and daub occupation) the construction of the actual mound was for a non-habitation purpose, and this is evidenced by the lack of habitation structure refuse.

Unit 7 was also originally classified by Strong as a residential space, but Silverman points out that there is an extraordinary amount of decorated pottery and special artifacts, such as an obsidian knife, embroidered fringed borders, a comb of cactus spines and cane, and a fine engraved gourd, and at best was perhaps the living space for priests.

Cahuachi&#x27;s layout largely depends on already existing topographical features, but it can also be said that it has a &quot;mound-kancha&quot; pattern. It is so named because there is much open, or rather empty, space at Cahuachi. Instead of bunches of construction taking up a space, the mounds at Cahuachi would be better described as islands. Because of the commitment to executing construction around and in convenience to the natural geography, it can be inferred that this may reflect social spatial organization for the site, which is interpretively unrestricted. It is easily accessible from virtually any direction, with no walls, or moats, or anything blocking entrance into the site.

Terracing hills was also a common practice at Cahuachi because it was &quot;energetically and materially cheap&quot; and still produced the appearance of monumental architecture, like large ceremonial mounds or temples. One of the more well-known mounds at Cahuachi came to be called by Strong the &quot;“Great Temple”&quot;. It is debatable whether or not that this construction is the one and only “Great Temple” at Cahuachi, but it truly did have a ceremonial purpose which is obvious by the large amounts of Nasca 3 pottery, panpipe fragments, llama remains, bird plumage, and other offertory materials recovered.

Rooms are not found on all mounds. For the rooms that do exist, the walls of are built of adobe. There are a few different types of adobe clay present at the site, and are sometime mixed together in the construction of walls and rooms. The types of adobe include: Beige, yellow, or grey. All of the rooms also had a final layer of mud. There are very few walls that had been painted. The walls were usually not very high (not exceeding one meter) and were very thick. The use of huarango posts in the construction of rooms and walls is also common at Cahuachi.

The major walls at Cahuachi were carefully constructed and well made. The layers of adobe used to build them are carefully regular, and had two final layers of mud plaster, as well as a white wash finish.

The &quot;Room of the Posts&quot; is said to have some sort of ancestor worship association because of the use of huarango posts. In this region, huarango is sometimes used to symbolize ancestry, sort of like the biblical tree of life. These “ancestor posts” are further supported by the structures apparent use as a burial place, and a special carved huarango post that depicts a human face and flute. Another interesting aspect to consider and is supportive of an ancestral interpretation is that the radiocarbon dates on some of the posts are earlier than Strong&#x27;s Nasca 5 dates of the area, which can be explained because perhaps they were not erected at the same time, but at important, symbolic life events, or that since they hold special significance that they were reused from an earlier structure. In one of the walls of the room there is a niche and two small depressions within that, containing spondylus shell. 

In addition to the already above mentioned artifacts, there were many plainware and decorated vessels including vases, bowls, bottles with handles, caches, musical instruments, and baskets. Strong dated many of these items to Nasca 5 times. There was also found in the Room of the Posts &quot;four bundles of tied canes conforming to back-strap looms&quot;. This versatility could perhaps be due to the fact that people carried all their belongings that they would need for their stay at Cahuachi. Fineware and plainware at Cahuachi was studied by Helaine Silverman where she studied types of vessel shape, painted design and color, and their relative dates and chronology. There are twenty five shape classes described by Gayton and Kroeber. Common vessel shapes at Cahuachi were the &quot;double-spout-and bridge- bottles&quot;. The Nasca phase of this class of pottery distributed at Cahuachi is largely phase 3 or undeterminable.

Another notable vessel class is Nasca 1 blackware bowls, early Nasca bowls, dishes, basket vessels, modeled vessels, neckless ollas, and necked ollas. According to Strong&#x27;s conclusions, Cahuachi&#x27;s main occupation was during Nasca 3. There was another major earlier Nasca occupation, corresponding to early Nasca 1 and 2, but was not the main occupation of Cahuachi.

== Nasca cult society and Cahuachi ==
Although Cahuachi held a significant position in the communities of Nasca 3 times, it was specifically a ceremonial center and did not have a large residential population, and therefore did not necessarily have a hierarchy of power or leadership like one that would be found at a complex habitational site. The varying sizes of mounds at the site do, however, provide a basis for distinguishing the social groups that created them. Mounds all over the Nasca drainage system were created by the local social groups in the region, and, as one would assume, the larger groups were the ones who built and maintained the largest temple mounds, while the lesser mounds were built by much smaller groups.

The amount of monumental architecture at Cahuachi, however, cannot be explained except for Helaine Silverman&#x27;s interpretation that Cahuachi held a sacred geography that made it the focus of the Nasca cult, which includes any political aspects that come along with this, such as monumental architecture being symbols of group unity and shared ancestry, while at the same time sending a widespread political message to allies or rivals. Cahuachi, as a religious pilgrimage destination, also leads to the assumption of community-wide participation and cooperation. Furthermore, Cahuachi&#x27;s obvious influence and importance in Nasca society and the fact that it was primarily a ceremonial center suggests that political power and social differences may not have been exclusively based on the economy. This is further evidenced by a lack of clear mortuary differentiation in early Nasca society and iconographic portrayals of elites, which lead researchers to believe that there could have been at least a group-oriented chiefdom where accumulation of personal wealth was forgone or otherwise unachievable.

The main thing that connected the segments of peoples in the Rio Grande de Nazca drainage system were their Nasca cultural traditions and religious cult where Cahuachi was the center, but only as a temporary pilgrimage site, and otherwise they lived in their own smaller communities with their own separate local ceremonial and domestic foci, and was therefore not politically centralized. Nasca society in terms of its location in the Rio Grande de Nazca drainage system also played its part in their sociopolitics. By observing and even literally mapping out the filtration gallery system – which determined settlement patterns as well – provided exclusive knowledge to those that were discerning of it, able to manipulate that knowledge, and therefore allowing for significant positions of power or control. These individuals were most likely &#x27;priests&#x27; or &#x27;shamans&#x27;.

==Religion and ideology==
Cahuachi&#x27;s primary application as a ceremonial center actually still leaves a lot to be discovered about the specifics of its religion and ideology. Cahuachi itself has mainly temples of varying sizes as its main architecture, where various religious practices and rituals took place, and was also used as a place to bury the dead and is surrounded by cemeteries. Cahuachi was obviously geographically sacred to the Nasca 3 people, it is just that it is unknown exactly why that is. Some things can be inferred upon, however, as in the case of the Room of the Posts, one of the most well-known constructions at Cahuachi. The room is characterized by well-made adobe walls that even happened to be painted with images pertaining to ceremonial uses such as Nasca panpipes, and rayed faces. The fact that the walls were painted at all is significant in itself because, except for the endless amount of painted pottery at the site, there is not much for examples of other mediums of painting there. The Room of the Posts contained niches and circular depressions filled with offertory goods like caches and pottery filled with corn, spondylus shells, or huarango pods, as well as such items as blue-painted ají peppers, gourd rattles, portable looms, and painted fineware.

Finally, inside the room there are huarango positioned upright all over the room. Some are aligned in certain directions, all of different heights, one group has three rows of three all standing together near the western wall, one is even carved into a face playing a flute. Besides the architectural features, there is not much to learn just from the presence of the posts, but the cultural features associated with the huarango plant in the Río Grande de Nazca region is significant. The huarango plant is a shrubby legume native to and grown in this region; it has symbolic ancestral meaning associated with the tree of life and a person&#x27;s spiritual roots, still held to this day. By looking at cultural beliefs in the region today, some interpreters have inferred that the room had ancestral and genealogical significance. As far as altars go, in the center of the room is a very low, square clay platform, in the middle of which is a round depression. Textile production was one of the few craft specializations that went on at Cahuachi on a regular basis. These fancy textile remains were most likely used as Nasca funerary shrouds or for presumably elite or priestly attire.

Highly stylized painted pottery was found throughout Cahuachi, and had the most religious significance when found in association with burials and offertory remains inside of them. Other remains that held religious purposes at Cahuachi were animal remains. Llama remains, bird plumage used as decoration for headdresses or the like, and guinea pig remains with broken necks and evidence of being sacrificed with their undersides slit open, were evidence of sacrificial rituals that are reminiscent of divination practices, still practiced by some today. Besides the altar in the Room of the Posts as described above, there were circular depressions and niches in the floors and walls of many of the other structures built. All of them contain or contained offertory items, mainly containers or caches of maize, spondylus shell, huarango pods, and blue-painted ají peppers. Other subsurface storage jars found without food in them can be used as evidence of communal feasting. There is little to no evidence of a prominent use of writing at Cahuachi.

There is some very specific iconography going on there, though, that portray masked ritual performers or priests, mythical beings, and ceremonial rites that honor agricultural fertility, as well as going so far as to confirm that farmers even participated in these celebrations as well. Finally, trophy head taking was an important aspect of the Nasca cult, which are displayed on early Nasca pottery where costumed figures hold decapitated human heads.

Pertaining to the elite and the “power” structure of Cahuachi, it was important because it was the main center for people all over the region to come together. Priests could definitely be considered elite because they more than likely got to spend the majority to spend most of their time there, and were therefore able to, as well as had special clothing that was probably manufactured and designed on site, as well as had privileged access to “temples” and rites in which they perform their sacred duties. Religion, as previously discussed, is unanimously a huge part of Nasca culture just from the very fact that Cahuachi exists, and the leaders of this place must have been influential in Cahuachi at the least. However, also previously discussed, the peoples of Nasca 3 times were spread out all over the Río Grande de Nazca drainage system region and were more or less separated into individual groups, where they lived in a most likely independent chiefdom governed areas.

==Death==

===Burials===
Burials at Cahuachi vary in content and effort. Burial excavations at Cahuachi were carried out by Strong, Kroeber, Doering, Farabee, Orefici, and Silverman. Types of graves include some human remains crudely buried in shallow graves, while others are in somewhat more complex, underground tombs. Almost all of the tombs at Cahuachi have wooden cane roofs covered by huarngo logs. The huarango plant, it is important to recall, has ancestral connotations and symbolism in the region surrounding Cahuachi. These tombs were also found with grave markers, which were upright canes, sticking out of the ground from the roof of the tomb. Other types of graves include cylindrical shafts, or large vessel urns. The most abundant grave goods are Nasca pottery.

All of the graves vary in amount of mortuary content, from little to none, and vary in types of artifacts included. The most noteworthy aspect of the graves at Cahuachi, then, is the fact that none would be considered overly elaborate or &quot;rich&quot; when compared to graves of other cultures around this time period. Especially considering that Cahuachi is the largest adobe ceremonial center of its time. There is not an overabundance of pottery in any of the graves where it is found. There are some remnants of food stuffs and spondylus shell, even a small fragment near some skeletal remains of red pigment, but nothing as substantial as the elaborate graves of pre-Columbian cultures that so enthrall the archaeological world.

The bodies themselves were almost all in a flexed position, usually in their sides or sitting, with their bodies, or at least their heads, facing south. Another thing that almost all of the remains had in common was that they were wrapped in, or laid on top of, elaborately woven and embroidered textiles. Textile specialization was one of the few productions that the Nasca people during the apogee of Cahuachi practiced. These textiles came in different colors, varying grave to grave. Some were white, or tan, others were even black, red, or green, and had embroidered or weaved iconography and decoration as well. Textiles at Cahuachi, although second in quantity to Nasca ceramics, are the best indicators of status in a grave. That being said, it is still not that much information, because of the lack of grave goods in general.

One example of differentiation in burials, possibly due to status, was two adult, most likely males, that were both buried within tombs (not associated with each other), but one of them did not have any grave goods at all, while the other contained three pots. Presumably one was of a higher status than the other. However, Nasca ceramics in general are the most abundant artifacts at Cahuachi and carry a variety of different information and meaning. Therefore, there is not enough information or sample to create a hierarchical social classification for the people buried with them of the different types of pottery, besides the distinction between plainware and fineware, and even then who is to say which in each distinction is better?

Other factors need to be considered before there can be a definitive answer, like what were the contents or uses of the vessels and were these actually more important than the vessels themselves? Some Nasca people were wrapped in better woven and decorated textiles than others (). It can be argued that there is a status differentiation in Nasca society based on the iconography and labor investment in textiles and the importance of textile production at Cahuachi. Pertaining to social status as well, some of the burials had deformed head shapes. Causes of death include sacrifice, or death in warfare, and of course more or less natural deaths. Children usually had the most elaborate burials. There were also adult males and females unearthed as well, varying in elaboration equally in their burials. Some of the adult, presumably males, were in poor condition where they had half of their teeth missing well before death and very worn bones, while other graves contained just the opposite: younger adult females, where the wisdom teeth had not broken through yet, with all of the teeth still present and in seemingly normal health as pertaining to the rest of the bones.

===Trophy heads===
There were multitudes of trophy heads recovered from the cemeteries of Cahuachi. Excavators Kroeber, Strong, Doering all found heads – or conversely bodies with heads missing – that indicate the practice of trophy head taking. Nasca trophy head taking occurs with warfare, ritual battles, and sacrificial practices. Nasca trophy heads are found in Nasca cemeteries, usually in tombs of other burials. It has been interpreted that the ritualistic reasoning behind taking the heads was “a ceremonial means of gathering the life – or soul – force of enemies,” and done during warfare where the main purpose of which was territorial expansion. Kroeber&#x27;s excavations include a burial where the head was missing, as well as a “nest of three trophy heads” in a separate grave, and six other trophy heads lining a tomb. Strong recovered in his excavations a head and vessel associated with each other. Nasca trophy heads have been known to be placed in large vessels in cemeteries.

Doering found at the front of a tomb, a line of nine trophy heads with plaited hair, and where two of them were on a bed of coca leaves. Silverman&#x27;s team discovered a young adult male head, and is a classic example of a Nasca trophy head:
The head exhibits frontal-occipital cranial deformation. Its eyes, eyebrows, beard, and mustache are present. The dark straight hair is elaborately braided. The skin is preserved but brittle. The scalp exhibits a series of deliberate incisions made with a sharp instrument. The tongue was removed. The lips were sealed with two splinters of huarango wood. A carrying cord emerges through a hole in the frontal bone. The cheeks were stuffed with plainweave cotton cloth.

==Warfare and violence==
Cahuachi is surrounded by cemeteries and burials. This is because it was a prominent ceremonial center, though, not because of any widespread violence or warfare. Many of the burials at Cahuachi have not been fully excavated yet, and the bodies that have been recovered have not been unwrapped and studied yet either. This means that there is little evidence of violence, not because it was absent, but because it just has not been discovered. So, it is not to say that the Nasca people did not experience violence whatsoever. As briefly discussed above, trophy heads found around the site of Cahuachi can be interpreted as evidence for warfare and violence. Iconography on late Paracas style pottery is also evidence of head hunting practices.

The context of the head taking, though, is still being widely worked out. There is some contention about whether the trophy heads were taken during actual territorial warfare, or were taken in staged ritualistic battles. The biggest problem that occurs with the idea of territorial conquest and warfare, at least in an early Nasca state, is that there is little to no archaeological evidence of any kind to support it, and so was most likely not the context in which the actual early Nasca trophy heads were found. Archaeological evidence does, however, shows an interesting increase in head hunting, between early and late Nasca times, right around when Cahuachi was finally abandoned, and when a more militaristic lifestyle became prevalent in late Nasca art. This can be taken to mean that while early Nasca times revolved around a religious center, they were stable and able to create Cahuchi, and therefore there was less violent conquest and territorial warfare than at other times.

One aspect about the use or meaning of the trophy heads, is that all can agree that in whatever situation they were acquired in, it was religious/ritualistic in nature. Whether it be the head of an enemy in battle or ritual battle, headtaking was done for reasons of acquiring power, status, or safety from the enemy&#x27;s soul. There is also iconographic evidence that suggests that after the abandonment of Cahuachi, that as headhunting became more &quot;secularized,&quot; the elite class shifted from being made up of priests and ceremonial figureheads, to being successful headhunters.

==Nasca iconography==
There is no archaeological evidence of writing at the site of Cahuachi. There is an abundance of Nasca style pottery at the site, however, and more specifically, much decorated fineware.

Some of the painting and decoration on the pottery is Nasca iconography: Nasca iconography can range in subject from trophy heads or warrior head takers, as previously mentioned, and mythical anthropomorphic figures, to everyday subjects that can display a chief or priest, a coca chewer, farmer, fisherman, &quot;impersonator of gods&quot; (masked ritual performer), musician, or llama-tender. These are roles are usually portrayed by men in Nasca pottery. Women are usually displayed carrying firewood, or reclined in &quot;voluptuous seated form&quot;, squatting in childbirth, and also chewing coca. These are general images shown in Nasca pottery throughout the Nasca culture, and are not all found specifically at Cahuachi. Nasca pottery did, however, reach &quot;an aesthetic and technological peak in EIP 3, corresponding to the apogee of Cahuachi&quot;.

Being that Cahuachi has an abundance of regular pottery, most likely for food and feasting purposes, but also a mass of fine pottery that is mostly associated with burials and ceremonial purposes, and the fact that fine pottery in Nasca society expressed religious as well as world views, there is much iconography to be collected at Cahuachi. Other types of images, like those portrayed in monumental style decorated pottery, display more natural figures, mostly birds. Another interesting aspect of Nasca iconography is what is not portrayed. Children never appear in Nasca iconography. Also, there is no hierarchy of scale in Nasca iconography; there are no figures larger than any others, or surrounded by smaller and therefore inferior images, that would indicate a difference in status or class.

==Decline of Cahuachi==
The change in use of the site, Cahuachi, from a prominent non-urban ceremonial center and pilgrimage destination during its apogee in Nasca 3 times to it only being largely used for burials, marks the decline of Cahuachi. This change in function occurred during Nasca 4 times, or early Intermediate Period epoch 4. The architecture at the site during this time was mostly abandoned, but did have &quot;postapogee&quot; offerings, like the trophy heads. As time went on from this point, Cahuachi was used less and less for ceremonial services, production, and ritual, and became exclusively a place to bury the dead. The evidence for the decline of Cahuachi comes from the archaeological record of Nasca pottery present, or absent, from the site as well as the abundance of burials and cemeteries surrounding Cahuachi that are dated by their association with late Nasca pottery. Presence of Nasca 4 sherds in some of the fill of the Room of the Posts proves that there was still Nasca people present at the site and that there was some continued ceremonial use, albeit not as much as during its apogee.

Pottery that dates to Nasca 6 and 7 times found in many of the burials at Cahuachi are also evidence of Cahuachi&#x27;s use during this time as mainly a burial site. The absence of abundant pottery use and any other evidence of ritual use or otherwise within and around the actual architecture of the site suggest that these constructions were abandoned after Nasca 5 times. The reason for the decline of Cahuachi is as yet, unknown, but the fall of their largest central ceremonial center and heart of the Nasca cult signifies the decline of the entire Nasca culture throughout the region. However, archaeological findings of Orefici suggest that Cahuachi was abandoned around 450–500 , due to a severe drought and after severe mudslides and earthquakes.

<text>114 Kassandra is a large and dark main-belt asteroid. It belongs to the rare class T. It was discovered by C. H. F. Peters on July 23, 1871, and is named after Cassandra, the prophetess in the tales of the Trojan War.

This object is classified as a rare T-type asteroid, with parts of the spectrum displaying properties similar to the mineral troilite and to carbonaceous chondrite. The shape of the spectrum also appears similar to fine grain from the Ornans meteorite, which landed in France in 1868. The light curve for this asteroid displays a period of 10.758 ± 0.004 hours with a brightness variation of 0.25 ± 0.01 in magnitude.

In 2001, 114 Kassandra was observed by radar from the Arecibo Observatory. The return signal matched an effective diameter of 100 ± 14 km. This is consistent with the asteroid dimensions computed through other means.

== In popular media ==
The 2009 miniseries &quot;Meteor&quot; featured 114 Kassandra being sent on a collision course with Earth due to a comet impact and the effort by scientists to stop it.

<text>Jenaro Quesada y Matheus, 1st Marquis of Miravalles, Grandee of Spain, (in full, ), (6 February 1818 – 19 January 1889), was a Spanish soldier

==Early life==
Quesada was born at Santander. He was the son of General Vicente Genaro de Quesada, a Conservative officer who was killed and mutilated outside Madrid by a revolutionary crowd in the early days of Queen Isabella&#x27;s reign.

As Quesada belonged to an ancient family connected with the Dukes of Fernan Nuñez, he was made a cornet when only six years old, was educated at the seminary for nobles and in 1833 was promoted to Lieutenant in the 1st Foot Guards. He served from 1833 to 1836 against the Carlists. When his father was assassinated in 1836 he resigned, went to France, got employment in a merchant&#x27;s office and was only induced to return to the army in 1837 by his relatives, who got him a company in the guards.

==Military career==
He distinguished himself often in the Carlist war, but his promotion was slow, and he declined to have anything to do with politics. He confined himself to his duties as a soldier, always fighting on the side of governments against Carlist, Republican and Progressive uprisings. He only became a General of Division in 1853, and at the head of the Madrid garrison, he fought hard in 1854 to avert the triumph of Espartero, General O&#x27;Donnell, who publicly recognized his gallant conduct.

When the war in Morocco broke out, O&#x27;Donnell gave Quesada the command of a division, which played so conspicuous a part in that campaign and at the battle of Wad el Ras, that its commander was made Lieutenant General and Grand Cross of Charles III.

He was director-general of the Guardia Civil &quot;(Civil Guard)&quot; when the military rebellion of June 22, 1866 broke out in Madrid and, after he had been wounded in the leg, he remained at the head of the loyal troops until the insurgents were crushed. He did not accept any military post during the revolution until General Serrano in 1874 offered him the direction of the staff, and he only accepted it after clearly stating that he was a royalist and partisan of King Alfonso XII of Spain.

In his long and brilliant career le never swerved from his steadfast resolve to be mixed up in any political or military intrigues or &quot;pronunciamientos&quot;. To use his own words, &quot;not even to restore my king.&quot;

As soon as the king was restored, the government of Antonio Cánovas del Castillo made Quesada the first General-in-chief of the army in central Spain, and in February 1875 general-in-chief of the army of the North. With the assistance of another officer who also had never dabbled in &quot;pronunciamientos&quot;, General O&#x27;Ryan, Quesada restored discipline in the armies confronting Infante Carlos, and for twelve months concerted and conducted the operations that forced the pretender to retire into France and his followers to lay down their arms. The government confided to the Marquis of Miravalles the difficult task of ruling the &quot;Northern Provinces&quot; for several years after the war, and he succeeded in conciliating the sympathies in the Basque Provinces and Navarre, though the penalty for their last rising had been the loss of most of their ancient liberties or &quot;fueros&quot;.

==Later life==
Quesada was made Marquis of Miravalles and Grandee after the war, minister of war in 1883 and senator. Though he was a strict, stern disciplinarian of the old school and an unflinching Conservative, Catholic and royalist, even his political and military opponents respected him, and were proud of him as an unblemished type of the Castilian soldier and gentleman.

He died in Madrid in January 1889, and was given full military honours.

<text>115 Thyra is a fairly large and bright inner main-belt asteroid that was discovered by Canadian-American astronomer J. C. Watson on August 6, 1871 and was named for Thyra, the consort of King Gorm the Old of Denmark. Based upon its spectrum, it is categorized as a stony S-type asteroid.

Observations made between 1978 and 1981 produced a composite light curve with two minima and maxima. However, a subsequent study in 1983 only found a single minima and maxima. A synodical rotation period of 7.241 hours was determined. This was confirmed by observations between 1995 and 2000. The changes in brightness and color indicate a surface with an uneven composition.

The asteroid has a slightly elongated shape, with a ratio of 1.20 between the lengths of the major and minor axes. The orbital longitude and latitude of the asteroid pole in degrees is estimated to be (λ0, β0) = (68°, 23°). Measurements of the thermal inertia of 115 Thyra give a value of around 75 m−2 K−1 s−1/2, compared to 50 for lunar regolith and 400 for coarse sand in an atmosphere.

<text>116 Sirona is a somewhat large and bright-colored main-belt asteroid that was discovered by the German-American astronomer C. H. F. Peters on September 8, 1871, and named after Sirona, the Celtic goddess of healing.

This body is orbiting the Sun with a period of 4.60 years and an eccentricity (ovalness) of 0.14. The orbital plane is inclined by 3.56° to the plane of the ecliptic. The cross-section diameter of this object is ~72 km. Photometric observations of this asteroid gave a light curve with a period of 12.028 hours and a brightness variation of 0.42 in magnitude. It has the spectrum of an S-type asteroid, suggesting a siliceous composition.

<text>Peter Julian Jenner (born 3 March 1943) is a British music manager and a record producer. Jenner, Andrew King and the original four members of Pink Floyd were partners in Blackhill Enterprises.

== Early career ==
Peter Jenner is the son of William Jack Jenner, a vicar, and grandson of British Labour Party Politician Frank Wise. Jenner was educated at Westminster School and Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he attained a first-class honours degree in Economics in 1963, aged 20. Appointed as a lecturer at the London School of Economics, after four years he left to manage the then up-and-coming band Pink Floyd. Jenner put on a number of free concerts in London&#x27;s Hyde Park which included the 1969 concert by The Rolling Stones. He was asked to manage David Bowie, but turned the offer down.

== London Free School and Notting Hill Fayre ==

John &quot;Hoppy&quot; Hopkins, Peter Jenner, Joe Boyd, Ron Atkins, Barry Miles, Michael de Freitas, John Michell, Julie Felix, Michael Horovitz and Nigel Waymouth and others, met at Hoppy&#x27;s flat in Queensway, London, twice a month. Inspired by the American Free Universities and the Victorian Jewish Free School in Spitalfields, the group wanted to offer a wide range of classes including photography, music, and mental health. Everyone involved had had some form of further education but felt that it wasn&#x27;t what it set out to be and wasn&#x27;t very good. So they set out to create a school that did the opposite. They set up the first meeting on 8 March 1966 and 120 people turned up, 50 expressing an interest in lessons. Over the spring and summer months, classes began. They were not official classes, more just people sitting and talking and smoking. By the autumn, things picked up and there were too many people wanting to attend. Rhaune Laslett offered the free school the use of her house for classes. The Free School needed funding, so Jenner set up a Pink Floyd at All Saints Hall in September. It was not a big hall: it could not hold more than 300 people. This was when Pink Floyd started the course to fame. By Christmas, the events were getting centre-page spreads in the &quot;Melody Maker&quot;.

Laslett later went on to work with the London Free School to set up the first Notting Hill Fayre. Talk of a carnival-style celebration floated around a few discussions about how to promote the Free School and the idea bloomed from there. Michael De Frietas suggested moving an indoor Trinidadian celebration to the streets around Portobello Road. Once everything was organised and in place, two musicians, Dave Tomlin and Joe Gannon led a small procession down Portobello Road to promote the fayre. Initially intended as a children&#x27;s event, the fayre began with a small pageant procession starting at Tavistock Square and passing through Ladbroke Grove, Notting Hill Gate, Westbourne Grove, and Acklam Road.

== Management career ==
Alongside childhood friend and music producer Andrew King, Jenner co-founded Blackhill Enterprises, in 1966, where they produced songs and albums for Pink Floyd, T. Rex, Ian Dury, Roy Harper, The Clash, The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, Robyn Hitchcock, Baaba Maal, Sarah Jane Morris, Denzil, Susheela Raman and Eddi Reader (Fairground Attraction). Jenner has also managed Billy Bragg for more than 30 years and still acts as his advisor/consultant.. While managing Ian Dury and the Blockheads, Jenner was the co-producer of the albums &quot;New Boots and Panties&quot; and &quot;Do It Yourself&quot;.

=== Blackhill Enterprises ===
Jenner set up Blackhill Enterprises with King and his wife, Sumi Nishihata (1935-2006), in 1966 after discovering Pink Floyd. Blackhill Enterprises set up Pink Floyd&#x27;s Games for May concert, the first pop concert in South Bank, in 1967. With support from MPs, such as Ben Whittaker, Blackhill was able to set up the first Hyde Park Free Festival. The concerts were held in June, July and August in 1968. 120,000 people gathered in the park to see artists such as Pink Floyd, Roy Harper, and Tyrannosaurus Rex. About the festival, Jenner said, &quot;The main reason we do them is because we feel a great interest in the importance of pop music in Britain&quot;. The free festivals continued for another eight years. Blackhill Enterprises disintegrated in 1981.

Jenner was also a contributor to the &quot;Blackhill Bullshit&quot;, a magazine which was distributed to concert promoters and agents in order publicise artists. The first issues were edited by Hugh Nolan, but it was taken over by Adrian Boot, who also designed the artwork layout. Jenner is featured in an interview with Edgar and Steve Broughton in the magazine&#x27;s sixth issue.

=== Pink Floyd ===
Pink Floyd, then an unknown band, began to receive paid bookings including at the Marquee Club in March 1966 where they were watched by Jenner. The band played mostly rhythm and blues songs, but Jenner was impressed with the strange acoustic effects that Barrett and Wright created during their performance. Jenner traced Waters and Mason to their flat, and with his business partner and friend Andrew King was subsequently invited to become their manager. Although the pair had little experience of the music industry, they shared an appreciation of music, as well as a childhood history. Using inherited money they set up Blackhill Enterprises and purchased new instruments for the band, as well as equipment which included a Selmer PA system. Under their guidance, Pink Floyd began performing on London&#x27;s underground music scene, notably at a venue booked by the London Free School in Notting Hill, as well as the notorious &quot;Games For May&quot; concert at London&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Hall on 12 May 1967, an event set up by both Jenner and King. Jenner and King&#x27;s diverse array of social connections were meritorious, gaining the band important coverage in &quot;The Financial Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. Jenner&#x27;s voice can be heard at the start of Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1967 &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot;, the opening track on the album &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (UK edition).&quot;

As the relationship between Syd Barrett and the other three members of Pink Floyd deteriorated, Jenner and King, believing Barrett to be the principal songwriter and the main creative force in the band, chose to continue to manage Barrett&#x27;s career, while permitting Waters, Mason, Wright, and new addition Gilmour, to continue to operate under the name Pink Floyd. Jenner and King parted company with Pink Floyd and continued as the managers of Barrett and other British rock bands.

=== Sincere Management ===
After Blackhill Enterprises disintegrated in the early 1980s, Jenner and Sumi set up Sincere Management, located on Bravington Road in West Kilburn, which managed a range of artists including Billy Bragg, Eddi Reader, Sarah Jane Morris, Robyn Hitchcock, The Unbending Trees, Sid Griffin and Outside Royalty.

== Other activity ==
Jenner was an executive of the International Music Manager&#x27;s Forum until 2006, and a director of the UK Music Managers&#x27; Forum. Jenner was involved in the Featured Artists Coalition.

In August 2010, he wrote for the Labour Uncut website, during the guest editorship of Tom Watson MP.

== On copyright ==
Jenner has been a regular commentator on copyright and the music industry. Amongst others he was interviewed on copyright by NetzpolitikTV and for the documentary &quot;Good Copy Bad Copy&quot;. An extensive interview with the Future of Music Coalition about copyright and technology is available as a podcast as part of the Coalition&#x27;s podcast series. In this, he explains that new technology is the future of the music industry and that &#x27;copyright is going to die because no-one will enforce it&#x27;.

Jenner has been critical of digital rights management (DRM). He has argued that in response to Napster the music industry invested heavily in DRM. He argues that the music industry &quot;persuaded themselves they could follow these files around and every time they were used a small amount of money would come magically to the companies. And then everything would be fantastic. But of course it did not work out that way because the public hates DRM as it stops them doing things they want to do in the digital domain.&quot; Jenner has long argued that governments should impose blanket licences for music online to counter copyright infringement, with a fee being collected by internet service providers (ISPs). He reasoned that &quot;If we can get £1 a month from every person in this island for music, that would give us £60 million a month,&quot; which according to Jenner comes close to the revenues of the music industry in the UK.

In 2006, Jenner wrote a paper, and gave a conference, called &#x27;Beyond the Soundbytes&#x27;, where he proposed an &#x27;access to music charge&#x27;, which is a compensation for artists, while removing any attraction and use of unauthorised digital music sites.

More recently, Jenner has been involved in efforts to build a music rights registry at European Union level, and has argued for an international music registry, supported by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). According to Jenner, &quot;we don&#x27;t know who owns what and where&quot; and this holds back the copyright licensing of music online. Jenner now wants to see a wide variety of online music services and business models being licensed, through a mixture of blanket licences and individual licences. Jenner argues that copyright, and intellectual property more generally, is a system which ensures that people get paid. He argues that &quot;Intellectual property is not something like a chair.&quot;

<doc id="738907" wikidata="Q3568503" url="?curid=738907" title="William Claiborne">
<text>William Claiborne (also spelled &quot;Clayborne&quot;,  – ) was an English surveyor and early settler in the colonies/provinces of Virginia and Maryland and around the Chesapeake Bay. Claiborne became a wealthy merchant and planter, as well as a major political figure in the mid-Atlantic colonies, and the founder of one of the First Families of Virginia. He featured in disputes between the colonists of Virginia and the later settling of Maryland, partly because of his earlier trading post on Kent Island in the mid-way of the Chesapeake Bay, which provoked the first naval military battles in North American waters. Claiborne repeatedly attempted and failed to regain Kent Island from the Maryland Calverts, sometimes by force of arms, after its inclusion in the lands that were granted by a 1632 Royal Charter to the Calvert family. Kent Island had become Maryland territory after the surrounding lands were granted to Sir George Calvert, first Baron and Lord Baltimore (1579–1632) by the reigning King of England, Charles I (1600–1649; reigned from 1625 until his execution in 1649).

Claiborne was an Anglican, a Puritan sympathizer, and deeply resentful of the Calverts&#x27; Catholicism. He was one of the signers, along with Virginia Governor John Pott, Samuel Matthews, and Roger Smyth, of a letter to the King&#x27;s Privy Council, dated 30 November 1629, complaining that Lord Baltimore refused to take the Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy to the Church of England. He sided with Parliament during the English Civil War of 1642–1651 and was appointed to a commission charged with subduing and managing the Province of Virginia and Province of Maryland, both British colonies at the time. He played a role in the submission of Virginia to parliamentary rule in this period. Following the restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, he retired from involvement in the politics of the Virginia colony. He died around 1677 at his plantation, Romancoke, on Virginia&#x27;s Pamunkey River. According to historian Robert Brenner, &quot;William Claiborne may have been the most consistently influential politician in Virginia throughout the whole of the pre-Restoration period&quot;.

==Early life and emigration to America==

Claiborne was born in Crayford parish in the county of Kent in England to Sarah Smith James, the widowed daughter of a London brewer, and was baptised on August 10, 1600. His father, Thomas Clayborn, was an alderman and lord mayor from King&#x27;s Lynn, Norfolk, who made his living as a small-scale businessman involved in a variety of industries, including the salt and fish trades. His elder half brother may have been Sir Roger James, a shareholder in the Virginia Company of London. The family name have various alternate spellings, as was common in the day, including Cleburn, Cleyborne, or Claiborne (the last of which he later adopted). William Claiborne was the younger of two sons. The family&#x27;s business was not profitable enough to make it rich, and so Claiborne&#x27;s older brother was apprenticed in London, becoming a merchant involved in hosiery and, eventually, the tobacco trade. He entered Pembroke College at the University of Cambridge on May 31, 1617.

Four years later, Claiborne was offered a position as a land surveyor in the new colony of Virginia, and arrived at Jamestown, on the north shore of the James River in October 1621, in the retinue of the colony&#x27;s new governor, Sir Francis Wyatt. The position carried a 200-acre (80 hectare) land grant, a salary of £30 per year, a house and the promise of fees paid by settlers who needed to have their land grants surveyed. Claiborne mapped out &quot;New Towne&quot;, an expansion of the growing Jamestown (which was becoming James City). His political acumen quickly made him one of the most successful Virginia colonists, and within four years of his arrival he had secured grants for 1,100 acres (445 hectares) of land and a retroactive salary of £60 a year from the Virginia Colony&#x27;s council. Meanwhile, the native Powhatan people had been disturbed by the influx of immigrants, particularly new villages established on traditional farming lands, the subsequent need to purchase food from the settlers, and the enforced placement of Indian youth in &quot;colleges.&quot; Months after Claiborne&#x27;s arrival, in March 1622, they attacked Jamestown and other plantations, killing hundreds in what became known as the Indian massacre. The settlers retaliated, killing hundreds of tribesmen and their families, burning fields, and spreading smallpox. Claiborne survived the attack, but recommended that the king take over the colony&#x27;s management.
Claiborne achieved financial success using his political success. Appointed to the Governor&#x27;s Council in 1624, he was named the colony&#x27;s Secretary of State in 1626. Around 1627, he began to trade for furs with the Susquehannock people who lived further north on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay, traveling or trading southward on two of its largest tributaries, the Susquehanna and Potomac rivers. Claiborne wanted to establish a trading post on Kent Island in the mid-way of the Chesapeake Bay, which he planned to make the center of his mercantile operations along the Atlantic Coast. Claiborne found both financial and political support for the Kent Island venture from London merchants Maurice Thomson, William Cloberry, John de la Barre, and Simon Turgis.

==Kent Island and the first dispute with Maryland==
In 1629, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, arrived in Virginia, having traveled south from Avalon, his failed colony on Newfoundland. Calvert was not welcomed by the Virginians, both because his Catholicism offended them as Protestants, and because it was no secret that Calvert desired a charter for a portion of the land that the Virginians considered their own. After a brief stay, Calvert returned to England to press for just such a charter, and Claiborne, in his capacity as Secretary of State of Virginia colony, was sent to England to argue the Virginians&#x27; case. This happened to be to Claiborne&#x27;s private advantage, as he was also trying to complete the arrangements for the trading post on Kent Island.

Calvert, a former high official in the government of King James I, asked the Privy Council for permission to build a colony, to be called Carolina, on land south of the Virginia settlements in area of the modern-day North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Claiborne arrived soon afterwards and expressed the concerns of Virginia that its territorial integrity was being threatened. He was joined in his protests by a group of London merchants who planned to build a sugar colony in the same area. Claiborne, still intent on his own project, received a royal trading commission through one of his London supporters in 1631, one which granted him the right to trade with the natives on all lands in the mid-Atlantic where there was not already a patent in effect.

Claiborne sailed for Kent Island on May 28, 1631, with indentured servants recruited in London and money for his trading post, likely believing Calvert&#x27;s hopes defeated. He was able to gain the support of the Virginia Council for his project and, as a reward for London merchant Maurice Thomson&#x27;s financial support, helped Thomson and two associates get a contract from Virginia guaranteeing a monopoly on tobacco. Claiborne&#x27;s Kent Island settlers established a small plantation on the island and appointed a clergyman. Around this same time, a trading outpost called &quot;Palmer&#x27;s Island Post&quot; was built on Garrett Island. While the settlement on Kent Island was progressing, the Privy Council had proposed to Sir George Calvert, former Secretary of State for the King that he be granted a charter for lands north of the Virginia colony, in replacement for the unsuccessful settlements of his earlier colony of Avalon in Newfoundland (eastern modern Canada), in order to create pressure on the Dutch settlements further north along the Delaware and Hudson Rivers (modern states of Delaware, New Jersey and New York). Calvert accepted, though he died in 1632 before the charter could be formally signed by King Charles I, and the Royal Grant and Charter for the new colony of Maryland was instead granted to his son, Cecilius Calvert, on 20 June 1632. This turn of events was unfortunate for Claiborne, since the Maryland charter included all lands on either side of the Chesapeake Bay north of the mouth of the Potomac River, a region which included Claiborne&#x27;s proposed trading post on Kent Island, mid-way on the Bay. The Virginia Assembly, still in support of Claiborne and now including representatives of the Kent Island settlers, issued a series of proclamations and protests both before and after when the news of the granting of the Maryland charter reached across the ocean, claiming the lands for Virginia and protesting the charter&#x27;s legality.

Claiborne&#x27;s first appeal to royal authority in the dispute, which complained both that the lands in the Maryland charter were not really unsettled, as the charter claimed, and that the charter gave so much power to Calvert that it undermined the rights of the settlers, was rejected by the Lords of Foreign Plantations in July 1633. The following year, the main body of Calvert&#x27;s settlers arrived in the Chesapeake and established a permanent settlement on Yaocomico lands at St. Mary&#x27;s City. With the support of the Virginia establishment, Claiborne made clear to Calvert that his allegiance was to Virginia and royal authority, and not to the proprietary authority in Maryland. Some historical reports claim that Claiborne tried to incite the natives against the Maryland colonists by telling them that the settlers at St. Mary&#x27;s were actually Spanish and enemies of the English, although this claim has never been proven. In 1635, a Maryland commissioner named Thomas Cornwallis swept the Chesapeake for illegal traders and captured one of Claiborne&#x27;s pinnaces in the Pocomoke Sound. Claiborne tried to recover it by force, but was defeated; although he retained his settlement on Kent Island. These were the first naval battles in North American waters, on 23 April and 10 May 1635; three Virginians were killed.

During these events, Governor John Harvey of Virginia, who had never been well liked by the Virginian colonists, had followed royal orders to support the Maryland settlement and, just before the naval battles in the Chesapeake, removed Claiborne from office as Secretary of State. In response, Claiborne&#x27;s supporters in the Virginia Assembly expelled Harvey from the colony. Two years later, an attorney for Cloberry and Company, who were concerned that the revenues they were receiving from fur trading had not recouped their original investment, arrived on Kent Island. The attorney took possession of the island and bade Claiborne return to England, where Cloberry and Company filed suit against him. The attorney then invited Maryland to take over the island by force, which it did in December 1637. By March 1638 the Maryland Assembly had declared that all of Claiborne&#x27;s property within the colony now belonged to the proprietor. Maryland temporarily won the legal battle for Kent Island and won again when Claiborne&#x27;s final appeal was rejected by the Privy Council in April 1638.

==Parliamentary Commissioner, move to Romancoke and the second dispute with Maryland==

In May 1638, fresh from his defeat over Kent Island, Claiborne received a commission from the Providence Land Company, who were advised by his old friend Maurice Thomson, to create a new colony on Ruatan Island off the coast of Honduras in the Caribbean Sea. At the time, Honduras itself was a part of Spain&#x27;s Kingdom of Guatemala, and Spanish settlements dominated the mainland of Central America. Claiborne optimistically called his new colony Rich Island, but Spanish power in the area was too strong and the colony was destroyed in 1642.

Until about 1640, Claiborne lived in Elizabeth City County. After 1640 he lived at a plantation (later Romancoke, Virginia), near the confluence of the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Rivers, in what was initially York County, but which through divisions in 1654 became New Kent County, and eventually in 1701 (after his death) King William County

Soon after, the chaos of the English Civil War gave Claiborne another opportunity to reclaim Kent Island. The Calverts, who had received such constant support from the King, in turn supported the monarchy during the early stages of the parliamentary crisis. Claiborne found a new ally in Richard Ingle, a pro-Parliament Puritan merchant whose ships had been seized by the Catholic authorities in Maryland in response to a royal decree against Parliament. Claiborne and Ingle saw an opportunity for revenge using the Parliamentary dispute as political cover, and in 1644 Claiborne seized Kent Island while Ingle took over St. Mary&#x27;s. Both used religion as a tool to gain popular support, arguing that the Catholic Calverts could not be trusted. By 1646, however, Governor Leonard Calvert had retaken both St. Mary&#x27;s and Kent Island with support from Governor Berkeley of Virginia, and, after Leonard Calvert died in 1648, Cecil Calvert appointed a pro-Parliament Protestant to take over as governor. The rebellion and its religious overtones was one of the factors that led to passage of the landmark Maryland Toleration Act of 1649, which declared religious tolerance for Catholics and Protestants in Maryland.

In 1648 a group of merchants in London applied to Parliament for revocation of the Maryland charter from the Calverts. This was rejected, but Claiborne received a final opportunity to reclaim Kent Island when he was appointed by the Puritan-controlled Parliament to a commission which was charged with suppressing Anglican disquiet in Virginia; Virginia in this case defined as &quot;all the plantations in the Bay of the Chesapeake.&quot; Claiborne and fellow commissioner Richard Bennett secured the peaceful submission of Virginia to Parliamentary rule, and the new Virginia Assembly appointed Claiborne as Secretary of the colony. It also proposed to Parliament new acts which would give Virginia more autonomy from England, which would benefit Claiborne as he pressed his claims on Kent Island. He and Bennett then turned their attention to Maryland and, arguing again that the Catholic Calverts could not be trusted and that the charter gave the Calverts too much power, demanded that the colony submit to the Commonwealth. Governor Stone briefly refused but gave in to Claiborne and the commission, and submitted Maryland to Parliamentary rule.

Claiborne made no overt legal attempts to re-assert control over Kent Island during the commission&#x27;s rule of Maryland, although a treaty concluded during that time with the Susquehannocks claimed that Claiborne owned both Kent and Palmer Island (now called Garrett Island. Claiborne&#x27;s legal designs on Maryland were once again defeated when Oliver Cromwell returned Calvert to power in 1653, after the Rump Parliament ended. In 1654, Governor Stone of Maryland tried to reclaim authority for the proprietor and declared that Claiborne&#x27;s property and his life could be taken at the Governor&#x27;s pleasure. Stone&#x27;s declaration was ignored and Claiborne and Bennett again overthrew him, creating a new assembly in which Catholics were not allowed to serve. Calvert, now angry at Stone for what he perceived as weakness, demanded that Stone do something, and in 1655 Stone reclaimed control in St. Mary&#x27;s and led a group of soldiers to Providence (modern Annapolis). Stone was captured and his force defeated by local Puritan settlers, who took control of the colony. Given the new situation, Claiborne and Bennett went to England in hopes of convincing Cromwell to change his mind but, to their dismay, no decision was made and, lacking royal authority, the Puritans gave power over to a new governor appointed by Calvert. Going behind Claiborne&#x27;s back, Bennett and another commissioner reached an agreement with Calvert that virtually guaranteed his continued control over Maryland through the remainder of the Protectorate.

With no authority left in Maryland, Claiborne turned to his political offices in Virginia. However, as a consequence of his continuous conflict and disruption, over several years, of authority and government in both Maryland and Virginia in pursuit of his commercial interests, as well as his alliance with the Parliament faction during these activities, upon the restoration of the British monarchy in 1660 he had few friends left in government. Claiborne therefore retired from political affairs in 1660 and spent the remainder of his life managing his 5,000 acre (2,023 hectare) estate, &quot;Romancoke&quot;, near West Point on the Pamunkey River, dying there in about 1677.

==Family life==

In the midst of the political turmoil of the conflict over Kent Island, Claiborne married Elizabeth Butler (or Boteler) of Essex, whose brother John was one of Claiborne&#x27;s associates in the Kent Island venture. The couple had four sons (William Claiborne Jr., John, Thomas and Leonard) and two daughters (Jane who married burgess Thomas Brereton of Northumberland County and Elizabeth who in 1668 patented 1000 acres of land in what was then King and Queen County and later became New Kent county).

==Death and legacy==
Claiborne&#x27;s date of death and precise gravesite are unknown. His eldest son, William Claiborne Jr.(ca. 1636 – before 1678), who in the 1650s was a merchant on his father&#x27;s behalf in England and served as a burgess in the following decade (1660–1678) as well as on the court to try members of Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion, inherited his father&#x27;s Romancoke plantation and other lands, but died before 1678. Thus, the next year, his younger son and merchant partner Thomas Claiborne (1647–1683) was noted as executor of his father&#x27;s estate in a deed dated August 25, 1670 and recorded in nearby York County. Another son (brother), John, returned from England, married and became guardian for his nephew William Claiborne III in 1787. Although Leonard Claiborne (1649–1694) both received Virginia land from his father and patented 3000 acres in what became King William County, he settled in Jamaica and served in that island&#x27;s assembly in 1693.

Several lines of American Claibornes claim emigrant William as their ancestor. Although none of this man&#x27;s sons served on the Council of State, his distant nephew Nathaniel Herbert Claiborne served there and six terms in Congress. Thomas Claiborne (1747–1811) and his sons John Claiborne (d. 1808) and Thomas Claiborne (1780–1856) all served as Congressmen. Other descendants include William C. C. Claiborne (Tennessee congressman and first governor of Louisiana), fashion designer Liz Claiborne, the late minister Jerry Falwell, Folk musician/science and linguistics writer Robert Claiborne, and a number of political figures from Tennessee and Virginia. Descendants have formed a society to advance the genealogical study of Claiborne&#x27;s lineage.

<doc id="738908" wikidata="Q129782" url="?curid=738908" title="Ishii Kikujirō">
<text>[[Viscount]] , was a Japanese diplomat and cabinet minister in Meiji, Taishō and early Shōwa period Japan. He served as Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Empire of Japan between 1915 and 1916.

== Biography ==
Ishii was born in Mobara city, Kazusa Province (present-day Chiba Prefecture). He graduated from the Law Department of Tokyo Imperial University and joined the Foreign Ministry. His first posting was as an attaché to Paris in 1891, and he was later sent to Chemulpo, Korea in 1896 and to Beijing, China in 1897. During the Boxer Rebellion he served as Japanese diplomatic liaison with the various foreign interventionist armies, spending six months on the front with the Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s 5th Infantry Division.

Ishii was appointed Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs under the 1st and 2nd Katsura administrations from 1908 to 1912, and was created a baron (&quot;danshaku&quot;) in the &quot;kazoku&quot; (peerage) on 24 August 1911; he had previously been appointed a Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure on 13 June. After a term as Japanese ambassador to France from 1912 to 1915, he became Minister for Foreign Affairs under the 2nd Ōkuma administration from 1915 to 1916, playing a major role in the normalization of relations between Japan and Russia.

In 1916, Ishii was raised to viscount (&quot;shishaku&quot;), and was appointed to a seat in the House of Peers of the Diet of Japan.

Ishii is remembered for his efforts to improve Japan–United States relations during a period of increasing tension over China, and the racist treatment of Japanese living in the United States. His approach reflected his strong belief that good relations between the United States and Japan were essential for Japan&#x27;s future economic and political growth. As special envoy to the United States from 1917 to 1918, he negotiated the Lansing–Ishii Agreement, which was intended to defuse tension between the two nations, but was limited in its effectiveness due to the reluctance of either government to make any concessions. Ishii stayed on in the United States as ambassador from 1918 to 1919, attempting to reduce tensions created by the Siberian Intervention of Japanese forces into the Russian Far East as part of western support for White Russian forces against the Bolsheviks.

Ishii traveled to Europe to take part in the Paris Peace Conference to take the initiative at the demarcation of the German–Polish border, and later served as president of the Council and the Assembly of the League of Nations in 1923 and 1926. He was also the leader of the Japanese delegation at the Geneva Naval Conference.

After his return to Japan, Ishii served as a member of the Privy Council from 1925 to 1945 in which he was highly outspoken in his strong opposition to the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Nazi Germany and fascist Italy.

During the third firebombing of Tokyo on May 25, 1945, Ishii was last seen heading towards Meiji Shrine, which was the designated safe refuge for his neighborhood association during the bombing. He never arrived, and he was presumed killed. His body was never found.

<text>117 Lomia is a large main-belt asteroid that has a nearly circular orbit; the orbital eccentricity is 0.029. It was discovered by French astronomer Alphonse Borrelly on September 12, 1871, from the Marseilles Observatory. The preliminary orbital elements were published in the following year by German astronomer Friedrich Tietjen. The reason for the name is uncertain, but Lutz D. Schmadel believes it is most likely a misspelling of Lamia, the female demon of Greek mythology (the asteroid 248 Lameia is also named after this figure).

Photometric observations of this asteroid in 1985 gave a light curve with a period of hours and a brightness variation of in magnitude. The curve is symmetrical with a single maxima and minima. This object has a spectrum that matches an XC classification; occupying the transition range between an X-type and a C-type asteroid. It has an estimated cross-section diameter of ~148 km.

Eight occultations of stars by Lomia have so far been observed, between 2000 and 2018. Four of these events provided two or more chords across the asteroid, including a four-chord event in 2003.

<text>Vasil Uladzimiravič Bykaŭ (also spelled Vasil Bykov, , ; 19 June 1924 – 22 June 2003) was a Belarusian dissident and opposition politician, junior lieutenant, and author of novels and novellas about World War II. A significant figure in Soviet and Belarusian literature and civic thought, his work earned him endorsements for the Nobel Prize nomination from, among others, Nobel Prize laureates Joseph Brodsky and Czesław Miłosz.

==Life and career==
Vasil Bykaŭ was born in the village Byčki, not far from Viciebsk in 1924. In 1941 he was in Ukraine when Operation Barbarossa began. Seventeen-year-old Bykaŭ was drafted into the Red Army, where he was assigned to digging trenches. As the war progressed, he later joined the fight against the Germans, rising to the rank of junior lieutenant. After the war, Bykau was demobilized, but later returned to the Red Army, serving from 1949 to 1955. He then began work as a journalist for the Hrodna Pravda newspaper. In the same decade his first novellas began to be published, of which the most famous are &quot;The Ordeal&quot;, &quot;The Obelisk&quot;, &quot;To Go and Not Return&quot;, and &quot;To Live Till Sunrise&quot;. &quot;The Ordeal&quot; inspired director Larisa Shepitko&#x27;s film &quot;The Ascent&quot;, released in 1977 and winner of the Golden Bear award at the 27th Berlin International Film Festival. During and after Perestroika, he participated in the Belarusian Popular Front. In October 1993, he signed the Letter of Forty-Two.

Bykaŭ&#x27;s literary achievement lies in his sternly realistic, albeit touched by lyricism, depictions of World War II battles, typically with a small number of characters. In the ferociousness of encounter they face moral dilemmas both vis-a-vis their enemies and within their own Soviet world burdened by ideological and political constraints. This approach brought vicious accusations of &quot;false humanism&quot; from some Red Army generals and the Communist Party press. Other reviews praised the uncompromising writing. &quot;Vasil Bykov is a very courageous and uncompromising writer, rather of the Solzhenitsyn stamp,&quot; wrote Michael Glenny in Partisan Review in 1972. Bykaŭ was one of the most admired writers in the Soviet Union. In 1980 he was awarded the honorific title of People&#x27;s Writer of the Byelorussian SSR. 

Several of Bykaŭ&#x27;s novellas are available in English, such as &quot;The Dead Feel No Pain&quot; (1965), &quot;The Ordeal&quot; (1970), &quot;Wolf Pack&quot; (1975) and &quot;Sign of Misfortune&quot;. However, most of the translations were done on the basis of Russian rendering. Bykaŭ wrote all of his works in his native Belarusian language, and translated several of them into Russian by himself. Vasil Bykaŭ&#x27;s status in his home country remains enormous. An opponent of Alexander Lukashenko&#x27;s regime and a supporter of the Belarusian Popular Front, he lived abroad for several years (first in Finland, then in Germany and the Czech Republic), but returned to his homeland a month before his death in 2003. The memory of his turbulent life and uncompromising stance on the war have only enhanced his reputation at home and abroad ever since.

<text>Simon Islip (died 1366) was an English prelate. He served as Archbishop of Canterbury between 1349 and 1366.

==Early life==

Islip was the uncle of William Whittlesey. He was a cousin of Walter de Islip, Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer: both took their surname from their native village of Islip, Oxfordshire. Simon was educated at the University of Oxford where he took his doctorate in canon and civil law and became a fellow of Merton College in 1307. He was regarded as one off the outstanding ecclesiastical lawyers of his time.

==Career==
Islip was rector of Easton, near Stamford, and of St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Horncastle; he became Archdeacon of Stow in 1332. He held several prebendaries of which the most important was Prebendal of Aylesbury at Lincoln Cathedral and was Vicar-General of the Diocese of Lincoln. He became Archdeacon of Canterbury in 1343 and subsequently Dean of Arches.

==Lord Privy Seal==

In 1347, possibly in September, Islip was appointed keeper of the Privy Seal. Previously he had held the seal of Lionel of Antwerp, the King&#x27;s second son, who was the regent in England. He enjoyed the trust and confidence of Edward III, who relied on him in political and diplomatic as well as Church affairs, and gave him extensive powers during his absence in France. Though loyal to the King he did not hesitate to oppose him where the affairs of the Church were concerned, and later addressed a famous remonstrance, the &quot;Speculum Regis Edwardi&quot;, refusing the King&#x27;s demand for a tenth of ecclesiastical income for six years. He vacated the office between 21 February and 1 May 1350.

==Archbishop of Canterbury==

Islip was elected to the see of Canterbury on 20 September 1349, following the death in quick succession of his three predecessors from the Black Death; provided to the see on 7 October 1349, and entrusted with the temporalities of the diocese on 15 November 1349. His consecration took place on 20 December 1349.

As archbishop during the first two outbreaks of the Death, Islip took great pains to regulate clerical stipends, as the greatly reduced number of clerics had led them to charge increased fees for their services. He believed that the times required strict economy, and this combined with a naturally frugal character, gained him a reputation for meanness. He succeeded in settling a long dispute with the Archbishop of York as to the latter&#x27;s right to carry his episcopal cross in the province of Canterbury.

==Death and afterward==

Islip died on 26 April 1366 at Mayfield, Sussex, having for three years been unable to exercise his office due to a stroke which deprived him of the power of speech. He left generous endowments to the monks of Canterbury. He also left money for the establishment of a new college at Oxford, but it did not flourish and was finally absorbed by Cardinal Wolsey into Christ Church, Oxford.

<text>KZJO (channel 22), branded as Fox 13+, is a television station in Seattle, Washington, United States, broadcasting the MyNetworkTV programming service. It is owned and operated by Fox Television Stations alongside Tacoma-licensed Fox outlet KCPQ (channel 13). The two stations share studios on Westlake Avenue in Seattle&#x27;s Westlake neighborhood; KZJO&#x27;s transmitter is located near the Capitol Hill section of Seattle.

Channel 22 began broadcasting as KTZZ-TV in 1985. It was the third independent station in the Seattle market and the first commercial ultra high frequency (UHF) station. It struggled to gain ratings attention competing against Seattle&#x27;s established independents, KSTW and KCPQ. USTV, a company owned by the Dudley family, acquired the station in two parts between 1987 and 1990; debts incurred under its original ownership prompted a bankruptcy in the early 1990s. In its early years, the station offered a range of local programs, including newscasts and sports telecasts produced by KIRO-TV; the eclectic talk show &quot;The Spud Goodman Show&quot;; and classic reruns and children&#x27;s shows.

KTZZ-TV became Seattle&#x27;s affiliate of The WB in 1995. When the Dudleys sought to exit broadcasting, they entered into a three-way deal that saw the stations transferred to Tribune Broadcasting. Shortly after, Tribune acquired KCPQ and had to place channel 22 in a divestiture trust before being able to form a duopoly in 1999. During that time, the station improved its technical facilities and relaunched as KTWB-TV. When The WB and UPN merged in 2006, the station was passed over for affiliation with The CW and signed up with MyNetworkTV, being renamed KMYQ. It debuted a 9 p.m. newscast from KCPQ in 2008. In 2010, the station changed its call sign to KZJO and rebranded as JoeTV, a name it used until 2022. Tribune was purchased by Nexstar Media Group in 2019; Nexstar then traded KCPQ and KZJO to Fox as part of an exchange of Fox affiliates in three cities. The station is the primary local broadcast home of Seattle Storm women&#x27;s basketball.

==History==
In 1966, King&#x27;s Garden, operator of religious AM and FM radio stations in Edmonds, applied for ultra high frequency (UHF) channel 22. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted the construction permit, but King&#x27;s Garden never built the station. By 1973, Maharishi International University applied for channel 22 and six other UHF stations across the United States, proposing educational and commercial programming.

===Construction and early years===
In 1981, the FCC designated three applications for channel 22 for comparative hearing, from Trinity Broadcasting of Seattle; Seattle STV; and Tavitac Corporation. The Tavitac application had been made in 1977. Trinity Broadcasting dropped out, and the other two applicants merged their bids into Seattle Broadcasting Corporation and won the construction permit in 1982. By late 1984, work was beginning on the station, which had taken the call sign KTZZ-TV. Dean Woodring, a general manager of TV stations in Spokane and Portland, Oregon, was named to the post for KTZZ and a station under construction in Portland.

KTZZ-TV began broadcasting on June 22, 1985. Broadcasting from studios at 945 Dexter Avenue North and a tower on Capitol Hill, it was Seattle&#x27;s first commercial UHF television station; at the time, the only such stations in the area were Christian station KTBW-TV on channel 20 and public station KTPS-TV (channel 28), both in Tacoma. Its programming largely consisted of classic TV shows and children&#x27;s programming, in contrast to existing independents KSTW and KCPQ, which emphasized movies. The station was bypassed in favor of KCPQ by the new Fox when it started later that year. The lineup was bolstered in 1986 when KIRO-TV (channel 7) struck a deal with the Seattle SuperSonics basketball team; KIRO produced 30 games, of which 15 aired on KTZZ. This was followed by a similar deal for Seattle Mariners baseball games in 1987. In both deals, KIRO sold most of the advertising with KTZZ getting selected advertising slots. KIRO dropped its Mariners agreement after 1988 due to the team&#x27;s poor ratings performance.

Financially, channel 22&#x27;s early history was rough. As the first major UHF station in town, many viewers thought they could not receive it even when it was available to them on cable. The station was the third-rated of Seattle&#x27;s three independents in the first year after it signed on; though it came much closer to KSTW in the ratings for its children&#x27;s programming, its first foray into local program production, the dance show &quot;Seattle Bandstand&quot;, lost its sponsors due to low ratings and left the air. In September 1986, several employees were laid off to control costs. In 1987, 40 percent of the station was sold to US-TV Network, a New York City firm run by ad sales representative Robert Dudley and financially backed by Australian broadcaster and businessman Kevin Parry. Despite the infusion of cash, the station continued to pare its payroll with more firings in late 1987 and early 1988. The Dudleys acquired the remainder of KTZZ in 1990 from Alden Television; it was their second television property after WXMI in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

On September 23, 1991, KTZZ began airing a 10 p.m. local newscast produced by KIRO-TV. The program was originally hosted by KIRO&#x27;s evening news team of Aaron Brown, Harry Wappler, and Wayne Cody and provided competition for KSTW&#x27;s 10 p.m. news. Later, KIRO anchors Gary Justice and Susan Hutchison became anchors at 10 on top of their existing assignments. This caused strife at KIRO and led to KIRO&#x27;s union, AFTRA, suing the station in June 1992 for unfair labor practices; an administrative law judge sided with Justice and Hutchison, stating that the additional newscast took away from preparation for the 5 and 11 p.m. reports and that there was no full-time producer dedicated to the KTZZ broadcast, further increasing the workload of existing KIRO employees. By that time, officials at both stations were discussing ending the newscast. Among all programs airing at 10 p.m. locally, the KTZZ news placed seventh. In spite of this, KIRO expanded its presence on channel 22 in April 1993 when the station began simulcasting two hours of KIRO radio&#x27;s morning newscast. The partnership ended shortly thereafter, and on September 17, 1993, the 10 p.m. newscast for KTZZ was ended.

KTZZ gained a reputation as a home for prime-time tabloid talk shows as well as some eclectic local programming. In 1992, &quot;The Spud Goodman Show&quot; debuted on channel 22. &quot;Spud Goodman&quot; formed part of a block of local shows aired between midnight and 2 a.m., including three music programs: &quot;Music Inner City&quot;, &quot;Rock Northwest&quot;, and &quot;Bohemia After Dark&quot;. All four programs were to be removed from the channel 22 schedule in September 1994, but &quot;Spud Goodman&quot; lasted on the lineup into 1995. During this time, KTZZ spent two years in bankruptcy reorganization. Three creditors—television program distributors MCA Television, MTM Distribution, and DLT Entertainment—forced the station into involuntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy in mid-1992. The debts were inherited by the Dudleys from the original ownership and had been accrued during the 1980s, when prices for syndicated programs were more expensive.

===WB affiliation===
On January 11, 1995, KTZZ affiliated with the newly-formed WB Television Network, signing an agreement just a week before the new network launched. The WB had initially signed KSTW in 1993 as its Seattle affiliate; that station&#x27;s owner, Gaylord Broadcasting, backed out of the deal a year later to affiliate with CBS, while UPN signed up KIRO, which had been the CBS affiliate.

The Dudleys put their two television stations on the market in 1996, citing industry consolidation. KTZZ and WXMI were sold to Emmis Communications in 1998; the two stations were then promptly dealt to Tribune Broadcasting in exchange for WQCD, an FM radio station in New York City. Eleven weeks after the sale to Tribune closed, the company agreed to purchase KCPQ, the market&#x27;s Fox affiliate. At the time, one company could only own one TV station in a market. As a result, KTZZ went on the market, and in December, Tribune applied to the FCC to place the station into a disposition trust headed by John Dudley.

Nonetheless, channel 22 forged ahead with plans formulated by Tribune to relaunch the station with new call letters and as a higher-profile WB affiliate in 1999. On April 26, 1999, KTZZ-TV became KTWB-TV, broadcasting from a new transmitter and antenna. The original facility had signal deficiencies in some areas, including in parts of Seattle.
Tribune originally needed to find a buyer for KTWB by September 1, 1999. The search became a moot point in August, when the FCC voted to legalize television duopolies. Deals creating duopolies were permitted beginning in November, at which time Tribune filed to purchase KTWB outright and own it alongside KCPQ. Its operations moved in with KCPQ; Tribune created 50 positions to match the 50 jobs that channel 22 had as an independent business, but not all of them matched the skill set of KTWB&#x27;s employees, some of whom Tribune offered to transfer elsewhere in the company. The station began airing newscasts from KCPQ preempted by Fox network sports programming and sharing some of KCPQ&#x27;s syndicated program inventory. In 2005, the KCPQ–KTWB facility began handling master control operations for KWBP-TV in Portland, which Tribune acquired from ACME Communications; the general manager of the Seattle stations also assumed responsibility for KWBP.

===MyNetworkTV and Joe TV===

On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and the Warner Bros. unit of Time Warner announced that the two companies would respectively shut down UPN and The WB and combine the networks&#x27; respective programming to create a new &quot;fifth&quot; network called The CW; the day of the announcement, it was revealed that 13 of Tribune&#x27;s 16 WB affiliates would become CW stations. The merger of networks left out Tribune-owned WB stations in three markets, including KTWB in Seattle, where The CW affiliated with a CBS-owned station. These three stations—WPHL-TV in Philadelphia, WATL in Atlanta, and KTWB—signed affiliation agreements in May with MyNetworkTV, set up by Fox Television Stations to serve its own ex-UPN outlets and other displaced stations. The station changed its call sign to KMYQ and branded as &quot;MyQ²&quot;, a brand extension of KCPQ.

At a time when the company was relaunching several of its secondary stations with new branding, Tribune rebranded KMYQ as &quot;JoeTV&quot; on September 13, 2010, and changed its call sign to KZJO. The station was positioned to be grittier and appeal to a younger male audience with its mix of syndicated shows. MyNetworkTV programming was deemphasized; for several years, the station website&#x27;s &#x27;about us&#x27; copy erroneously said that the MyNetworkTV affiliation ended with the JoeTV relaunch.

===Sinclair sale attempt; acquisition by Nexstar and Fox===

Tribune Media agreed to be sold to Sinclair Broadcast Group on May 8, 2017, for $3.9 billion and the assumption of $2.9 billion in debt held by Tribune. As Sinclair already owned KOMO-TV and KUNS-TV, KCPQ was among 23 stations identified for divestment in order to meet regulatory compliance for the merger. Sinclair agreed to purchase KZJO and sell KCPQ to Fox Television Stations as part of a $910 million deal; Howard Stirk Holdings additionally agreed to purchase KUNS-TV. Lead FCC commissioner Ajit Pai publicly rejected the deal in July 2018 after details of Sinclair&#x27;s proposed divestitures came to light; weeks later, Tribune terminated the merger agreement with Sinclair, nullifying both transactions.

Tribune Media agreed to be acquired by Nexstar Media Group for $6.9 billion in cash and debt on December 3, 2018. Following the merger&#x27;s completion on September 19, 2019, Fox Television Stations purchased KCPQ and KZJO as part of a $350 million deal, with Fox citing KCPQ&#x27;s status as the broadcaster of most Seahawks home games as the impetus for the transaction. The sale was completed on March 2, 2020. After its acquisition by Fox, KZJO dropped the Joe TV moniker and rebranded to &quot;Fox 13+&quot; on September 26, 2021, conforming with the branding of other Fox-owned stations.

==Local programming==
===Newscasts===

On March 31, 2008, KMYQ began airing a KCPQ-produced 9 p.m. newscast airing Monday through Sunday. The station also exclusively airs KCPQ&#x27;s weekend editions of &quot;Good Day Seattle&quot;, its morning newscast.

===Sports programming===
In 2014, the station began to air Major League Soccer matches featuring Seattle Sounders FC alongside KCPQ. The station also aired pre-match and post-match coverage for the team through the end of the 2022 season.

In 2016, KCPQ and KZJO began broadcasting locally televised games of the Seattle Storm of the WNBA; initially starting with 15 home games on channel 22 in 2016, KZJO was slated to carry 29 games in the 2023 season with six more on KCPQ. In 2024, it was scheduled to air 23 games with KCPQ airing another seven.

Other local sports are aired in limited quantities on KZJO. It is the Seattle affiliate for Gonzaga men&#x27;s basketball games and &quot;The Mark Few Show&quot;, produced by KHQ-TV in Spokane. In the 2022 and 2023 season, the station aired telecasts of OL Reign women&#x27;s soccer; it was supplanted in this role by KONG (channel 16) for 2024. In 2023, the station agreed to air ten Seattle Thunderbirds junior hockey games. As of 2025, KZJO also airs games from the Seattle Seawolves of Major League Rugby.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KMYQ shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 22, on June 12, 2009, as part of the mandatory federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 25, using virtual channel 22. KZJO relocated its signal from channel 25 to channel 36 on January 17, 2020, as a result of the 2016 United States wireless spectrum auction.

===Translators===
The station is broadcast on two translators:
* Centralia/Chehalis: K15MI-D
* Everett: K29ED-D

<text>Samois was a lesbian feminist BDSM organization based in San Francisco that existed from 1978 to 1983. It was the first lesbian BDSM group in the United States. It took its name from Samois-sur-Seine, the location of the fictional estate of Anne-Marie, a lesbian dominatrix character in Pauline Réage&#x27;s erotic novel &quot;Story of O&quot;, who pierces and brands O. The co-founders were writer Pat Califia, who identified as a lesbian at the time, Gayle Rubin, and sixteen others.

The roots of Samois were in a group called Cardea, a women&#x27;s discussion group within the mixed-gender BDSM group called the Society of Janus. Cardea existed from 1977 to 1978 before discontinuing, but a core of lesbian members, including Califia and Rubin, were inspired to start Samois on June 13, 1978, as an exclusively lesbian BDSM group.

Samois was strongly rebuked (and sometimes picketed) by Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media (WAVPM), an early anti-pornography feminist group. WAVPM, like later anti-pornography feminists, was very strongly opposed to sadomasochism, seeing it as ritualized violence against women. Samois members felt strongly that their way of practicing sadomasochism was entirely compatible with feminism, and held that the kind of feminist sexuality advocated by WAVPM was conservative and puritanical. Samois openly confronted WAVPM with their position, and the exchanges between the two groups were among the earliest battles of what later became known as the feminist sex wars, with Samois being among the very earliest advocates of what came to be known as sex-positive feminism.

The book &quot;Coming to Power&quot;, edited by members of the Samois group and published in 1981, was a founding work of the lesbian BDSM movement.

In the 1982 anthology &quot;Against Sadomasochism&quot;, American philosopher Judith Butler, credited as &quot;Judy Butler&quot;, criticizes Samois in her essay &quot;Lesbian S&amp;M: The Politics of Dis-Illusion&quot;. Several other essays in the work also criticize it.

Samois split up in 1983 amid personal infighting; however, in 1984, Rubin went on to help form another organization called The Outcasts. The Outcasts lasted until 1997, until they too split due to infighting. A breakaway group called The Exiles is still extant and carries on in the tradition of Samois and The Outcasts. In 2012, The Exiles in San Francisco received the Small Club of the Year award as part of the Pantheon of Leather Awards.

In 1996, Califia and Robin Sweeney published an anthology titled &quot;The Second Coming: A Leatherdyke Reader&quot; that also contained historical information on The Outcasts, as well as other lesbian BDSM groups such as the Lesbian Sex Mafia and Briar Rose.

In 2007 the National Leather Association International inaugurated awards for excellence in SM/fetish/leather writing. The categories include the Samois award for anthology.

In 2019 Samois was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame.

<text>118 Peitho is a main-belt asteroid. It is probably an S-type asteroid, suggesting a siliceous mineralogy. It was discovered by R. Luther on March 15, 1872, and named after one of the two Peithos in Greek mythology. There have been two observed Peithoan occultations of a dim star: one was in 2000 and the other in 2003.

This body is orbiting the Sun with a period of 3.81 years and an eccentricity (ovalness) of 0.16. The orbital plane is inclined by 7.7° to the plane of the ecliptic. The cross-section diameter is ~42 km. In 2009, Photometric observations of this asteroid were made at the Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The resulting asymmetrical light curve shows a synodic rotation period of 7.823 ± 0.002 hours with a brightness variation of 0.15 ± 0.02 in magnitude. This was reasonably consistent with independent studies performed in 1980 (7.78 hours) and 2009 (7.8033 hours). The lightcurve inversion process has been used to construct a model of this object, suggesting a blocky shape with flattened poles.

<text>Raejuusto (trans. &quot;granular cheese&quot; also known as grynost by the Swedish speaking Finns) is a Finnish fresh cheese that is rather similar to cottage cheese. In Sweden, raejuusto-type cheese is known as keso, and in Denmark as hytteost. Raejuusto is made from cow&#x27;s milk.

Raejuusto has a low fat content, similar to cottage cheese and a high protein content. It can be enjoyed on its own or together with, for instance, cucumber, olive oil and ground black pepper. Raejuusto is also often used to garnish soups and other dishes.

<doc id="738940" wikidata="Q744989" url="?curid=738940" title="Masayoshi Ito">
<text>was a Japanese political figure. He served as acting Prime Minister of Japan in 1980 after the sudden death of Masayoshi Ōhira. He then served as foreign minister of Japan from 1980 to 1981.

==Early life==
Ito was born on 15 December 1913 in Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima, where his grandfather was a member of the Aizu clan.

==Career==
Following the death of Masayoshi Ōhira, Ito became the acting prime minister for a brief period of about a month. In this brief period, he received a report in July from the Comprehensive National Security Study Group which encouraged Ito to strengthen Japan–United States relations whilst also increasing Japanese military self-sufficiency in light of developments within socialist Asia, such as the Sino-Vietnamese War and the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan, which seemed to signal reductions in American power on the continent. Following this brief period, Ito served as Foreign Minister from July 1980 to May 1981 in the cabinet of Zenko Suzuki, but he resigned from this position following American outrage at what the US government perceived as the Japanese government distancing itself from the US-Japanese military alliance following the previously mentioned Asian war developments.

Ito developed a reputation as a &quot;clean&quot; and honest politician who did not become mired in scandals, and for this reason was suggested as a possible successor to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita after he resigned in disgrace due to the Recruit scandal, although Ito expressed doubts about whether the LDP was serious about reform after top party bosses rejected his comprehensive reform agenda and he thus declined.

==Personal life==
Ito was a cinephile and a fan of Mitsuko Mori. Ito, then battling with diabetes, died on 21 May 1994.

<text>The West Walker River is a tributary of the Walker River, approximately long, in eastern California and western Nevada in the United States. It drains part of the Sierra Nevada range along the California-Nevada border in the watershed of Walker Lake in the Great Basin. The river derives its name from Joseph R. Walker, a mountain man.

It rises from snowmelt in the Sierras of northwestern Mono County, north of Yosemite National Park approximately south-southwest of Walker in the snowfields on the northeast faces of Tower Peak and Forsyth Peak on the Sierra crest in the Toiyabe National Forest. It flows north, along the west side of the Sweetwater Mountains, emerging into the Antelope Valley, a ranching region around Walker. It flows north past Coleville and Topaz and enters southern Douglas County, Nevada southwest of Carson City. In Nevada it flows northeast, joining the East Walker River from the west 7 mi (11.3 km) south of Yerington to form the Walker River.

The river is heavily used for irrigation in the ranching valleys along its lower course. Its waters are diverted along its upper course to form Topaz Lake along the California-Nevada border. It receives the Little Walker River from the south near its source in the mountains.

U.S. Highway 395 passes through the West Walker River Valley, connecting it via Devil&#x27;s Gate Pass to the East Walker River; Sonora Pass and Monitor Pass lead from the valley into the Sierra Nevada and the Carson River valley. In January 1997 a record-setting flood along the West Walker River destroyed of U.S. 395. This section of road was rebuilt in six months. The silt carried by the river settled in Topaz Lake, hurting the trout population there.

<text>Pasquier Quesnel, CO (; 14 July 1634 – 2 December 1719) was a French Jansenist theologian.

== Life ==
Quesnel was born in Paris, and, after graduating from the Sorbonne with distinction in 1653, he joined the French Oratory in 1657. There he soon became prominent; he took a leading part in scholarly controversy, for example against Joseph Anthelmi.

His Jansenist sympathies led to his banishment from Paris in 1681, following the formulary controversy. He took refuge with the friendly Cardinal Coislin, bishop of Orléans; four years later, however, foreseeing that a fresh storm of persecution was about to burst, he fled to Brussels, and took up his abode with Antoine Arnauld.

There he remained till 1703, when he was arrested by order of the archbishop of Mechelen. After three months imprisonment he made a highly dramatic escape, and settled at Amsterdam, where he spent the remainder of his life. After Antoine Arnauld&#x27;s death in 1694 Quesnel was generally regarded as the leader of the Jansenist party; and his &quot;Réflexions morales sur le Nouveau Testament&quot; played almost as large a part in its literature as Jansen&#x27;s &quot;Augustinus&quot; itself.

As its title betokens, Quesnel&#x27;s book was a devotional commentary on the New Testament, wherein Quesnel managed to explain the aims and ideals of the Jansenist party better than any earlier writer had done; and it accordingly became the chief object of Jesuit attack. It appeared in many forms and under various titles, the original germ going back so far as 1668; the first complete edition was published in 1692. The papal bull &quot;Unigenitus&quot;, in which no fewer than 101 sentences from the &quot;Réflexions morales&quot; were condemned as heretical, was obtained from Clement XI on 8 September 1713. Quesnel died at Amsterdam in 1719.

&quot;Unigenitus&quot; marked the end of Catholic toleration of Jansenist doctrine. The bull &quot;Unigenitus&quot;, dated 8 September 1713, was produced with the contribution of Gregorio Selleri, a lector at the College of Saint Thomas, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot;, fostered the condemnation of Jansenism by condemning 101 propositions from the &quot;Réflexions morales&quot; of Quesnel as heretical, and as identical with propositions already condemned in the writings of Jansen.

<doc id="738971" wikidata="Q1452713" url="?curid=738971" title="Frederic Eugene Ives">
<text>Frederic Eugene Ives (February 17, 1856 – May 27, 1937) was a U.S. inventor who was born in Litchfield, Connecticut. In 1874–78 he had charge of the photographic laboratory at Cornell University. He moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where in 1885 he was one of the founding members of the Photographic Society of Philadelphia. He was awarded the Franklin Institute&#x27;s Elliott Cresson Medal in 1893, the Edward Longstreth Medal in 1903, and the John Scott Medal in 1887, 1890, 1904 and 1906. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1922. His son Herbert E. Ives was a pioneer of television and telephotography, including color facsimile.

==Color photography==

Ives was a pioneer in the field of color photography. He first demonstrated a system of natural color photography at the 1885 Novelties Exposition of the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. His fully developed Kromskop (long-vowel marks over both &quot;o&quot;s and pronounced &quot;chrome-scope&quot;) color photography system was commercially available in England by late 1897 and in the US about a year later.

Three separate black-and-white photographs of the subject were taken through carefully adjusted red, green and blue filters, a method of photographically recording color first suggested by James Clerk Maxwell in 1855 and imperfectly demonstrated in 1861, but subsequently forgotten and independently reinvented by others.

Transparent positives of the three images were viewed in Ives&#x27; Kromskop (a device known generically as a chromoscope or photochromoscope), which used red, green and blue filters and transparent reflectors to visually combine them into one full-color image. Both monocular and stereoscopic Kromskop viewers were made. Prepared sets of images, called Kromograms, were sold for viewing in them. Alternatively, a Kromskop &quot;triple lantern&quot; projector could be used to illuminate each image with light of the correct color and exactly superimpose them on a projection screen.

Special cameras and camera attachments were sold to prospective &quot;Kromskopists&quot; who wanted to create their own Kromograms.

The quality of the color was highly praised but the system was not a commercial success. It was discontinued shortly after the 1907 introduction of the Autochrome process, which was simple to use and required no special equipment.

In 2009, several Kromogram views of San Francisco made by Ives six months after the 1906 earthquake and fire were discovered while cataloging a collection of Kromograms at the National Museum of American History. They are believed to be the only existing images showing the aftermath of that disaster in natural color (i.e., with color recorded and reproduced photographically rather than added in by hand), as well as the earliest extant natural color photographs of San Francisco.

==Stereoscopic photography==

In 1903 Ives patented the parallax stereogram, the first &quot;no glasses&quot; autostereoscopic 3-D display technology. A compound image consisting of fine interlaced vertical slivers of a stereoscopic pair of images was seen in 3-D when viewed through a slightly separated fine grid of correctly spaced alternating opaque and transparent vertical lines, now known as a parallax barrier. The grid allowed each eye to see only the slivers of the image intended for it.

Ives first exhibited such an image in 1901, at which time he stated that the basic concept had occurred to him about sixteen years earlier while working with line screens for the halftone process. In 1904, Auguste Berthier came forward to claim due credit for the first publication of this concept. He had included it near the end of an 1896 article about large-format stereoscopic images. Berthier had also created an extremely coarse and nonfunctional interlaced image for purposes of illustration, but he never reduced the idea to practice or attempted to patent it.

Eventually, several other inventors, including Ives&#x27; son Herbert, substituted an array of narrow cylindrical lenses for the simple parallax barrier and incorporated more than two viewpoints, creating lenticular parallax panoramagram 3-D images of the type most familiar from 3-D postcards, trading cards and similar novelties, often confused with holograms. The original parallax barrier method is currently (2017) employed in several no-glasses 3-D video displays.

Ives also patented the use of parallax barriers for displaying changeable images.

As early as 1900, Ives was tinkering with stereoscopic motion pictures. By 1922, he and fellow inventor Jacob Leventhal were producing a popular series of anaglyph 3-D novelty shorts called &quot;Plastigrams&quot;. The first one was released by Educational Pictures in December 1922, and the later ones by Pathé Films.

==Halftone process==

Halftone processes allow photographs, complete with their &quot;half-tone&quot; intermediate shades of gray or color, to be reproduced in ink on paper by means of a printing press, like text. Prior to such processes, images were printed in books and periodicals by means of hand-engraved metal plates or wood blocks, or from drawings made on lithographic stones. Half-tone effects were obtained by engraving closely spaced parallel or hatched lines, by stippling, or by exploiting the granular texture inherent in the stone lithography process.

Ives is sometimes referred to as &quot;the&quot; inventor of &quot;the&quot; halftone process, but this is incorrect and Ives never made such a claim for himself. There was not one halftone process, but a considerable number of them, the earliest dating nearly as far back as the introduction of practical photography in 1839. They varied widely in their degree of practicality and the quality of their results. The first attempts involved directly etching the unique images formed on metallic Daguerreotype plates. Although pleasing results were obtained, etching the plates required great skill and care, the images could not be printed along with ordinary type, and the delicate plates wore out after a very small number of impressions, making such processes useless for publishing on a commercial scale. More practical processes started appearing in the 1860s, but high cost, special printing requirements or low image quality variously kept these early processes from coming into widespread use.

Ives turned his attention to halftone processes in the late 1870s. The objectives were to more or less automatically convert the intermediate tones of a photographic image into small lines or dots of stark black and white; to do this better, or at least more efficiently, than was possible with existing processes; and to create a printing block that could be combined with blocks of text in an ordinary printing press. The lines or dots, of varying widths or sizes respectively, had to be small enough to adequately blend together in the eye at a normal viewing distance, producing the illusion of various shades of gray, yet the printing plates had to be durable enough to last through a typical press run without excessive degradation. Above all, the process had to be economical enough to make its widespread commercial use practical.

Ives patented his first &quot;Ives&#x27; process&quot; in 1881. This early process required the creation of a photographic relief image, made by a variety of the carbon process, from which a plaster cast was made. The highest areas on the surface of the plaster corresponded with the darkest areas of the original photograph. The cast was pressed into contact with an inked rubber grid consisting of an array of tiny pyramidal elements, which caused a regular array of ink dots to be deposited on the plaster, their sizes varying according to the heights of the surface. The dot pattern was then photographed onto a metal plate coated with photoresist, which was developed and chemically etched, a process known as photoengraving and already in use for making printing plates from line drawings, handwriting and other purely black and white subject matter. Although complex, this process was simpler and more efficient than other processes then in some limited use, and in 1884 Ives asserted that it was &quot;the first patented or published process which was introduced into truly successful commercial operation.&quot;

A few years later, Ives replaced this process with the much simpler one usually associated with his name. In the new process, an ordinary photograph was rephotographed directly onto the sensitized metal plate. A crossline screen, consisting of two glass plates finely ruled with opaque lines and sandwiched together with their lines crossing at right angles, was positioned near the surface of the metal, and a specially shaped diaphragm was used with the camera lens. Combined with the inherently stark black-and-white nature of the photoengraving process, these devices served to break up the image into a regular pattern of dots of various sizes with optimized shapes. During the 1890s, photographs reproduced by this second &quot;Ives process&quot; largely replaced the use of hand-engraved wood block and steel plate illustrations. It remained the standard process for photographically illustrating books, magazines and newspapers during the next eighty years. Although much more technologically sophisticated methods eventually came into use for creating the printing plates, the structure of most printed halftone images has remained virtually unchanged.

==Colorimetry==
Ives was also an important contributor to the development of the science of colorimetry. His paper of 1915 proposed a color model in the form of a cube, with three of the vertices forming a triangle for the additive primaries, three others a triangle for their secondary colors, and the two remaining (opposite) vertices for black and white. A similar model was adopted by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) as the basis of their color space drawn up in 1926, revised in 1931, which has been influential on all scientific color studies since then.

<text>120 Lachesis is a large main-belt asteroid. It was discovered by French astronomer Alphonse Borrelly on April 10, 1872, and independently by German-American astronomer Christian Heinrich Friedrich Peters on April 11, 1872, then named after Lachesis, one of the Moirai, or Fates, in Greek mythology. A Lachesean occultation of a star occurred in 1999 and was confirmed visually by five observers and once photoelectrically, with the chords yielding an estimated elliptical cross-section of .

This body is orbiting the Sun with a period of 5.50 years and an eccentricity (ovalness) of 0.05. The orbital plane is inclined by 7° to the plane of the ecliptic. Photometric observations of this asteroid were made in early 2009 at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico. The resulting light curve shows a synodic rotation period of 46.551 ± 0.002 hours with a brightness variation of 0.14 ± 0.02 in magnitude. It is a very slow rotator with the longest rotation period of an asteroid more than 150 km in diameter. As a primitive C-type asteroid it is probably composed of carbonaceous material.

<text>James Merritt Ives (March 5, 1824 – January 3, 1895) was an American lithographer, bookkeeper, and businessman. He oversaw the business and financial side of the firm, Currier and Ives, which he co-managed with his business partner, Nathaniel Currier.

==Biography==
Ives was born on March 5, 1824, in New York City. His father worked as the superintendent of Bellevue Hospital in New York City. A self-trained artist, Ives&#x27;s art education included visits to art galleries and the Astor Library. Although he went to work at the age of 12, he continued his art education on his own.

On June 24, 1846, he married Caroline Clark (1827–1896). The couple had six children, two sons and four daughters. Caroline was the sister-in-law of Nathaniel Currier&#x27;s brother, Charles Currier. Charles recommended Ives to Nathaniel, who hired him as a bookkeeper in 1852 for his firm, N. Currier, Lithographer.

It soon became apparent that Ives&#x27; talent as an artist and artistic knowledge gave him valuable insight into what the public wanted, and his skills in business and marketing contributed significantly to the growth of the company. Ives helped to improve and modernize Currier&#x27;s bookkeeping methods, reorganize the firm&#x27;s inventory, and streamline production methods. In 1857, Currier offered Ives a full partnership in the firm, now called Currier and Ives, and made the younger man the general manager. In his new position Ives helped Currier interview potential artists and craftsman, and select images that the firm would publish. It was Ives who encouraged production of the idealized images of daily middle class American life that made the firm so successful.

The firm of Currier and Ives was known for its popular and affordable art prints of subjects such as winter scenes, landscapes, sporting events, ships, and icons of 19th century life. These prints are still widely sought after by collectors today. Ives worked over forty years at the firm until his death in Rye, New York, in 1895. He is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. After Ives&#x27;s death, his sons and Currier&#x27;s sons continued to manage the firm until it was liquidated in 1907.

<text>Carazo () is a department in Nicaragua. It covers an area of and has a population of 198,395 (2021 estimate). The capital is Jinotepe.

==Geography==
Much of the department consists of a large plain sloping gently down towards the Pacific Ocean. The main urban centres are Diriamba and Jinotepe in the interior. The adjoining departments are Managua, Masaya, Granada and Rivas.

The climate is tropical with the temperature varying between . The hottest months are April and May. The rain falls mainly between May and October and the rest of the year is dry.

==Economy and tourism==
The inland part of the department produces a variety of agricultural crops including high quality coffee and near the ocean the subtropical climate suits citrus trees and sugar cane. Livestock and cereal crops are also produced there and stone of volcanic origin is quarried.

The Pacific coast offers beaches with tourist facilities. Other tourist destinations include the Salto de la Culebra Waterfall, and the Centro Ecoturístico La Máquina, a private nature reserve, both near Diriamba. The Museo Ecológico de Trópico Seco is a museum in Diriamba which has displays on the flora and fauna of the department.

==Wildlife Reserve Río Escalante-Chacocente==
The Río Escalante-Chacocente Wildlife Reserve is situated near Santa Teresa and is one of the most important dry tropical reserves in Nicaragua. A half kilometre stretch of beach attracts large numbers of olive ridley sea turtles (&quot;Lepidochelys olivacea&quot;), known locally as paslama turtles. These come on land on several consecutive nights at certain phases of the moon between July and December to dig holes in the sand and lay their eggs. Park rangers are on hand to prevent the eggs being collected and sold locally for food. The incubation period is about 48 days and after that time, millions of juvenile turtles dig their way out of the nests and try to make their way down to the sea. Predatory birds engage in a feeding frenzy at this time, so to keep them safe, some of the eggs are transported to special nursery areas where the young turtles can be protected when they hatch. Other beaches in the park have Hawksbill sea turtles (&quot;Eretmochelys imbricata&quot;) and green sea turtles (&quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;) nesting.

The park is 4,645 hectares in area and has simple accommodation facilities in tents or at a hostel. Trails lead through the park and there are a wide variety of trees, flowering plants, birds and animals to be seen.

<doc id="738987" wikidata="Q1562506" url="?curid=738987" title="H.450">
<text>H.450 refers to a set of standards created by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to define several Supplementary Services of the packet based telecommunication protocol known as H.323. It parallels another set of standards known as QSIG which define similar services for ISDN based networks.

* H.450.1, Supplementary Services Framework
The general mechanism for delivering supplementary services is explained in this paper. Supplementary services messages are exchanged by means of ROSE (Remote Operations Service Extension).

* H.450.2, Call Transfer Supplementary Service
E.g. explains how a party-B can turn an active call between party-A and party-B into a call between party-A and a new party-C.

* H.450.3, Call Diversion Supplementary Service
E.g. explains how an IP phone can activate a diversion to e.g. a cell phone.
E.g. explains how an IP phone can interrogate whether it has any active diversion.

* H.450.4, Call Hold Supplementary Service 
E.g. explains how a call can be put on hold and be fed with a music on hold.

* H.450.5, Call Park and Pickup Supplementary Service
Think of big warehouse, where a call is coming in at the front-desk for Mrs. Smith.
The front-desk parks the call and broadcasts via the intercom: &quot;Mrs. Smith, please 223&quot;.
Mrs. Smith proceeds soon after to the next wall phone, dials 223 and gets the call.

* H.450.6, Call Waiting Supplementary Service 
Explains how to signal a second call to an IP phone already engaged in an active call.

* H.450.7, Message Waiting Indication Supplementary Service 
Explains elements related to voicebox systems and how these can be implemented by means of H.323.

* H.450.8, Name Identification Supplementary Service

<text>Iwasa Matabei (; original name Araki Katsumochi 1578 – July 20, 1650) was a Japanese artist of the early Tokugawa period, who specialized in genre scenes of historical events and illustrations of classical Japanese and Chinese literature, as well as portraits. He was the son of Araki Murashige, a prominent &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Sengoku period who had been made to commit suicide, leaving Matabei to be raised with his mother&#x27;s family name, Iwasa.

Matabei&#x27;s work was noted for its distinctive figures, with large heads and delicately drawn features, and he was effective both in colour and monochrome ink-wash painting, using an individual brush technique combining Tosa and Kanō elements. 
Although trained by Kanō Naizen of the Kanō school, he was more influenced by the traditions of the Tosa school, and signed a late series of portraits of the Thirty-six Poetry Immortals (1640) commissioned by the &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Iemitsu for a temple as &quot;the artist Matabei of the later current from Tosa Mitsunobu&quot;.

The works of Matabei have an affinity with the early paintings of , but there is a disagreement among scholars as to whether they are themselves or not. In Japan, it is common to regard Matabei as the originator of . On the other hand, there is a theory that Matabei is not the source of , but rather an independent painter of the Tosa school, because his patrons were from high social classes. According to this theory, he is misunderstood as the source of only because he is confused with the painter of the same name (Ōtsu no Matabei) who appears in Chikamatsu&#x27;s plays.

His son Katsushige (d. 1673) was also a painter, known for dancing figures in a style like that of his father.

==Notable works==
The only work by Iwasa Matabei that has been designated a National Treasure is , which is held by the Tokyo National Museum. The term refers to depicting the scenery and customs of the urban and suburban areas of Kyoto. Numerous works were created from the Sengoku period to the Edo period, and only two works by Iwasa Matabei and Kanō Eitoku have been designated as National Treasures. Matabei&#x27;s work depicts the Kyoto landscape around 1615 and is known as the &quot;Funaki version&quot; because it was owned by the Funaki family. It shows the Nijō Castle of the Tokugawa clan on the left and the Hōkō-ji Great Buddha Hall, symbolizing the Toyotomi clan, on the right.
 is a work depicting the festival held at Toyokuni Shrine in 1604 to commemorate the seventh anniversary of Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s death. It has been designated as an Important Cultural Property and is housed in the Tokugawa Art Museum. Although the preparations for this festival were carried out under the direction of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the missionary Jean Crasset analyzes that Ieyasu&#x27;s intention was to adopt Hideyoshi&#x27;s achievements as his own. On the left side of the artwork, there is a scene of people in the city dancing enthusiastically in extravagant costumes against the backdrop of the Hōkō-ji Great Buddha Hall. On the right, there is a scene depicting the dedication of the traditional dances &quot;noh&quot; and &quot;dengaku&quot; at the Toyokuni Shrine.

Matabei established a workshop and painted magnificent and long based on the text of . The MOA Museum of Art houses three masterpieces: , , and . These three works are considered masterpieces, with the first two being designated as Important Cultural Properties. tells the story of Ushiwaka&#x27;s revenge for the murder of his mother, Tokiwa Gozen. depicts a romantic story involving Ushiwaka. tells the story of Horie Saburo&#x27;s child who seeks revenge for the death of his parents.
The work titled in the Yamatane Museum is one of the works created by dividing a pair of folding screens, each with six panels that originally depicting twelve different subjects into twelve parts, each of which was transformed into an individual hanging scroll. This particular work of art has been designated as an Important Cultural Property.

<doc id="738991" wikidata="Q380105" url="?curid=738991" title="Iwasaki Yatarō">
<text>was a Japanese industrialist and financier known as the founder of Mitsubishi, one of Japan&#x27;s largest conglomerates.

==Early life==
Yatarō Iwasaki was born on 9 January 1835 in Aki, Tosa Province (now Kōchi Prefecture) into a provincial farming family. Iwasaki&#x27;s family had been members of the &quot;samurai&quot; warrior nobility, but his great great grandfather, Iwasaki Yajiemon () had sold off his family&#x27;s &quot;samurai&quot; status in obligation of debts during the Great Tenmei famine. His family derived from Iwasaki clan that was a branch of Takeda clan of Kai Province (). The ancestor of Iwasaki clan was Iwasaki Nobutaka () known as Takeda Shichirō () who was the fifth son of Takeda Nobumitsu. The Iwasaki clan served Aki clan (), and Chōsokabe clan () at the Battle of Sekigahara (October 21, 1600).

Iwasaki began his career as an employee of the Yamauchi clan, the ruling clan of the Tosa Domain which had business interests in many parts of Japan. Iwasaki left for Edo aged nineteen for his education, but his studies were interrupted a year later when his father was seriously injured in a dispute with the village headman. Iwasaki accused the local magistrate of corruption for refusing to hear his case, and was subsequently sent to prison for seven months after he was kicked out from his village. After his release, Iwasaki was without a permanent job for a time before finding work as a tutor. Iwasaki returned to Edo, where he socialised with political activists and studied under the Yoshida Toyo, a reformist and modernization advocate from Tosa Province. Yoshida was employed by Yamauchi Toyoshige, the &quot;daimyō&quot; (lord) of the Tosa Domain, and he influenced Iwasaki with ideas of opening and developing the then-closed Japan through industry and foreign trade. Iwasaki found work as a clerk for the Yamauchi government through Yoshida, and eventually bought back his family&#x27;s &quot;samurai&quot; status. Iwasaki was promoted to the top position at the Yamauchi clan&#x27;s trading office in Nagasaki in Hizen Province, responsible for trading camphor oil and paper to buy ships, weapons, and ammunition.

==Mitsubishi==


Iwasaki travelled to Osaka following the Meiji Restoration in 1868 which overthrew the ruling Tokugawa Shogunate, abolishing the feudal system in Japan and forcing the disbandment of the shogunate&#x27;s business interests. In March 1870, Iwasaki became president of the Tsukumo Trading Company, a shipping company founded on behalf of the Yamauchi clan, and leased the trading rights. In 1873, the company changed its name to Mitsubishi, a compound of &quot;mitsu&quot; (&quot;three&quot;) and &quot;hishi&quot; (literally, &quot;water chestnut&quot;, often used in Japanese to denote a rhombus or diamond). Mitsubishi&#x27;s emblem was a combination of the Iwasaki family crest, showing three overlapping lozenges, and the crest with three oak leaves, arranged in a threefold rotational symmetry, of the Yamauchi family, which controlled the part of Shikoku where Yatarō was born.

From 1874 to 1875, Iwasaki was contracted by the Japanese government to transport Japanese soldiers and war materials. The Japanese government purchased a number of ships for the Japanese Expedition of 1874 to Taiwan against the Paiwan Aborigines in southeast Taiwan, and these ships were later given to Mitsubishi after the expedition was finished in 1875. This created strong links between Mitsubishi and the Japanese government that ensured the new company&#x27;s success. In return, Mitsubishi supported the new Japanese government and transported troops who defeated the Satsuma Rebellion in 1877. Thus, the success of Mitsubishi became intertwined with the rise of the modern Japanese state and economy and one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; &quot;zaibatsu&quot; companies. In 1885, a merger of Mitsubishi shipping activities with competitor Kyodo Unyu Kaisha (founded 1882) led to the adoption of the company&#x27;s name Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, or &#x27;NYK&#x27; in short, which still exists and is one of the largest global shipping groups. 

Subsequently, Iwasaki invested in mining, ship repair, and finance industries in addition to shipping. In 1884, Iwasaki took a lease on the Nagasaki Shipyard, which allowed the company to undertake shipbuilding on a large scale and renamed it the Nagasaki Shipyard &amp; Machinery Works, which are now part of its Mitsubishi Heavy Industries industrial branch. 

Iwasaki often held dinners for dignitaries, spending a huge amount of money on these occasions, but he also made many friends who later helped him by doing favors.

==Death==
Iwasaki died of stomach cancer on 7 February 1885, aged 50, and was succeeded as the head of the family business first by his brother, Iwasaki Yanosuke, and later his son, Hisaya. In 1903, Iwasaki&#x27;s fourth daughter, Masako, married Baron Shidehara Kijūrō, the first Prime Minister of Japan after World War II.

==Popular culture==
Iwasaki serves as the secondary protagonist of the 49th NHK Taiga drama, &quot;Ryōma den&quot;, focusing on his activities during the &quot;Bakumatsu&quot;, and also serves as the framing narrator of the story. He is portrayed by Teruyuki Kagawa.

<doc id="738994" wikidata="Q969896" url="?curid=738994" title="Ralph Izard">
<text>Ralph Izard (January 23, 1741/1742May 30, 1804) was an American politician who served as president pro tempore of the United States Senate in 1794.

==Early life==

Izard was born at &quot;The Elms&quot; near Charleston, South Carolina. He was the son of Henry Izard and Margaret Johnson. His great-grandfather was Ralph Izard (1660–1710), who was born in Dorchester, England and settled in South Carolina. His maternal grandfather was Province of South Carolina Governor Robert Johnson. Izard&#x27;s parents died when he was a small child, and only one of his siblings survived to adulthood.

He spent most of his childhood and youth studying in England: he attended a school in Hackney, London, and matriculated as a fellow-commoner at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. Izard returned to America in 1764, but did not remain in South Carolina for long. He was elected the American Society (later the American Philosophical Society) in 1768.

==Career==
He resided in London in 1771 and moved to Paris, France, in 1776. He was appointed commissioner to the Court of Tuscany by the Continental Congress in 1776, but was recalled in 1779. He returned to America in 1780 and pledged his large estate in South Carolina for the payment of war ships to be used in the American Revolutionary War. He was a member of the Continental Congress in 1782 and 1783. In 1788, he was elected to the United States Senate and served from March 4, 1789, to March 4, 1795, serving as President pro tempore of the Senate during the Third Congress.

===Later life===
Izard was one of the founders of the College of Charleston. Izard retired from public life to the care of his estates in 1795. Within two years of his retirement, he was stricken with an untreatable illness that paralyzed him on one side of his body.

==Death and legacy==

In 1767, Izard married Alice De Lancey, who was a niece of James DeLancey and a descendant of Stephanus Van Cortlandt and Gertrude Schuyler. After Izard moved to America in 1780 to focus on his work towards the American Revolution, his family stayed in France until 1783 when they joined him in South Carolina. Izard and his wife had fourteen children together, but only seven survived past early childhood, including:

* Ralph Izard was a naval hero of Tripoli. The World War II USS &quot;Izard&quot; was named after him. In 1808, Izard married Eliza Pinckney, daughter of Major General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, a signer of the Constitution, and a granddaughter of Colonel Charles Pinckney, chief justice of South Carolina. Ralph&#x27;s wife was also a niece of Arthur Middleton.
* Major General George Izard was a governor of Arkansas.
* Anne Izard, who married William Allan Deas {1764-1863} with whom they had a son, the painter, Charles Deas. William&#x27;s brother was Col. James Sutherland Deas {1784-1864} who was the father of CS General Zachariah Cantey Deas
* Charlotte Izard, who married William Loughton Smith, a son of S.C. Assemblyman Benjamin Smith; William L. Smith was also a brother-in-law of South Carolina Congressman Isaac Motte.

Izard died near Charleston on May 30, 1804, at the age of sixty-two. He is interred in the churchyard of St. James Goose Creek Episcopal Church, near Charleston.

Izard was a slaveholder.

===Descendants===
A great-grandson of Ralph Izard was Charles Manigault Morris who was also a great-grandson of Lewis Morris. A cousin of Charles Manigault Morris was General Arthur Middleton Manigault who was descended from Mary Izard-cousin of Ralph Izard.

A cousin Sarah Izard married South Carolina Loyalist Governor Lord William Campbell. A cousin twice removed was Elizabeth {Eliza} Izard who was a daughter-in-law of Congressman of South Carolina Thomas Pinckney. One niece Elizabeth Izard married Alexander Wright (1751–?), a son of Loyalist Governor of Georgia James Wright (governor).

<text>Bread cheese ( or &quot;juustoleipä&quot; ; ; or &quot;brödost&quot;), sometimes known in the United States as Finnish squeaky cheese, is a Finnish fresh cheese traditionally made from cow&#x27;s colostrum. In America, cow&#x27;s milk is generally used but can also be made with goat milk. Commercially available versions are typically made from cow&#x27;s milk. The cheese originally comes from Southern Ostrobothnia, Northern Finland, and Kainuu.

==Finnish name==
Traditionally, the cheese has been called &quot;leipäjuusto&quot; mainly in Ostrobothnia and Lapland and &quot;juustoleipä&quot; in Kainuu. Nowadays the two words are interchangeable, but &quot;leipäjuusto&quot; is the more common spelling. Other dialects have various names (such as narskujuusto) that refer to the way that fresh leipäjuusto &quot;squeaks&quot; against the teeth when bitten.

==Preparation==

The milk is curdled and set to form a round disk from two to three centimeters thick. After this, bread cheese is baked, grilled, or flambéed to give it its distinctive brown or charred marks.

Traditionally, bread cheese was dried and could then be stored for up to several years. For eating, the dry, almost rock hard cheese was heated on a fire which softened it and produced an especially appetizing aroma. Even today, the cheese may be dried by keeping it in a well ventilated place for a few days. It has a mild flavour.

==Methods of serving==

Bread cheese can be eaten warm or cold, and is served in a number of ways:
* The traditional way is to serve it as slices, as a side dish with coffee.
* A few pieces are placed in a cup, with hot coffee poured on. The Swedish name &quot;kaffeost&quot; (&quot;coffee cheese&quot;) refers to this.
* Served as diamond-shaped pieces, roughly 5 to 7 cm long and a little less wide, with cloudberry jelly or fresh cloudberries.
* Slices of the cheese are cut into a cup or plate, with some cream poured on the pieces so that they soak a little, some cinnamon and sugar sprinkled over it, and grilled in the oven for a moment. Served with cloudberry jelly.
* In modern Finnish cuisine, diced bread cheese is often used as a mild replacement for feta in various salads.
* As a dessert, bread cheese can be served like Camembert, fried on a pan with butter until it softens, and served with jam, traditionally cloudberry.

<text>Trelew (, from &quot;town&quot; and the name of the founder, Lewis Jones) is a city in the eastern part of the Chubut Province of Argentina, 21km away from the coast. Located in Patagonia, the city is the largest and most populous in the low valley of the Chubut River, with 97,915 inhabitants as of 2010. The Trelew municipality is part of the Rawson Department, whose capital, Rawson, is also the provincial capital.

Trelew is an important commercial and industrial centre for the region and is the main hub for wool processing, accounting for 90 percent of activity in Argentina. The produce of this industry is mainly shipped and exported through Puerto Madryn and Puerto Deseado.

Trelew is home to the Museum of Paleontology Egidio Feruglio, showcasing the paleontological heritage of the Patagonic region, and considered one of the most important of its kind in South America. It also has an Astronomic and Planetary Observatory.

The city is served by the Almirante Marcos A. Zar Airport, of both civilian and military use. The airport&#x27;s runway is shared with the Almirante Zar Naval Base, home of the Lockheed P-3 Orion squadron of the Argentine Naval Aviation.

==History==

Trelew&#x27;s foundation is linked with Welsh settlement in Argentina, the leaders of which were Captain Sir Thomas Duncombe Love Jones-Parry (of Madryn) and Lewis (Luis) Jones, who acted as spokesmen to deal with the Argentine government in the beginning of the 1860s. The town was named Trelew in honour of the latter Jones: &quot;tre&quot; meaning &quot;town&quot; in Welsh and &quot;Lew&quot; being an apocope for &quot;Lewis&quot;.

Trelew was established on 20 October 1886 as the starting point for the Central Chubut Railway line that would link the lower Chubut River Valley to Puerto Madryn. Railway building equipment and 400 settlers arrived on July 28 of that same year on the steamer &quot;Vesta&quot;. The line was opened in 1888 and later extended from Trelew to Gaiman, Dolavon and finally to Las Plumas. In 1961, the line was closed.

===1972 massacre===

Trelew was the scene of a massacre in 1972. A breakout of political prisoners at the federal penitentiary resulted in the death of one guard and the attempted flight of about 100 individuals who opposed the military dictatorship which followed the overthrow of President Arturo Illia. A small group of prisoners succeeded in commandeering a plane and flying to safety in Chile. The rest submitted to the authorities and were returned to a military prison, where 19 were shot (three survived).

The town of Trelew was searched by the military and locals were seized and taken to the Villa Devoto prison in Buenos Aires. Virtually the entire town went on strike and succeeded in securing the release of the prisoners at Villa Devoto. These incidents were documented in the book &quot;La Pasión según Trelew&quot;, by Tomás Eloy Martínez, which was originally published in 1973, but was then suppressed by the dictatorship of the &quot;Proceso&quot;, and reissued in 1997.

==Tourism==

Trelew is the centre of tourism in the Central Meseta, the Valley of the Chubut River and the coast. Punta Tombo, the biggest penguin reserve in Argentina, is accessible from the city.

An annual Eisteddfod is held in Trelew in October, a traditional festival which receives guests from across the country and from Wales, which constitutes a unique expression of Welsh culture in South America.

The former Trelew railway station, which was declared a national historic monument in 1969, has functioned as a museum, &quot;El Museo Regional Pueblo de Luis&quot;, since 1984.

==Sports==
Racing de Trelew and Huracán de Trelew are the most important local football clubs. Patoruzú Rugby Club and Trelew Rugby Club are the local clubs practicing this sport. In boxing, the Matthysse brothers, Lucas and Walter, are from Trelew, although most of their notable fights took place in the United States.

==Gallery==
==Climate==
According to the Köppen climate classification, Trelew experiences a cold semi-desert climate (&quot;BSk&quot;) bordering on a cold desert climate (&quot;BWk&quot;), with warm summers, cold winters and low precipitation year-round.

<text>KCPQ (channel 13) is a television station licensed to Tacoma, Washington, United States, serving the Seattle area. It is owned and operated by the Fox network through its Fox Television Stations division alongside KZJO (channel 22), which broadcasts MyNetworkTV. The two stations share studios on Westlake Avenue in Seattle&#x27;s Westlake neighborhood; KCPQ&#x27;s main transmitter is located on Gold Mountain in Bremerton.

The station signed on in August 1953 as KMO-TV, the television outgrowth of Tacoma radio station KMO. It was briefly an NBC network affiliate until another Seattle station signed on; the next year, KMO radio and television were sold to separate owners. The Seattle broadcaster J. Elroy McCaw bought channel 13, changed the call sign to KTVW, and ran it as an independent station. While KTVW produced a number of local programs, McCaw, a famously parsimonious owner, never converted the station to broadcast in color, and its syndicated programming inventory was considered meager. McCaw died in August 1969; three years later, his estate sold the station to the Blaidon Mutual Investors Corporation. While Blaidon tried several new programs and began color telecasting, the station continued to underperform financially. Two attempts to sell KTVW to out-of-state buyers failed because of its high liabilities. After a walkout by employees in January and the appointment of a receiver in July, KTVW was ordered closed on December 12, 1974.

The Clover Park School District in Lakewood purchased KTVW at bankruptcy auction in 1975. The station returned to the air on a non-commercial basis as KCPQ in January 1976, serving as an effective replacement for Clover Park&#x27;s UHF station, KPEC-TV (channel 56). Changes to the structure of school financing in Washington and the refusal of voters to approve bonds to rebuild Clover Park High School forced the school district to sell KCPQ back into commercial use. After being off the air for most of 1980 to relocate its transmitter, KCPQ returned under new owner Kelly Broadcasting, who rebuilt it as a more competitive independent station. During Kelly&#x27;s 19-year ownership of KCPQ, the station became a Fox affiliate, relocated its studios from Lakewood to Seattle, and established its present local news department.

KCPQ was sold to Tribune Broadcasting in 1999 as part of Kelly&#x27;s exit from the broadcasting industry. As Tribune expanded the station&#x27;s news output, it also had to fend off overtures by Fox, which had sought to own KCPQ on several occasions since the 1990s and at one point threatened to buy another station to broadcast Fox programming. Tribune was purchased by Nexstar Media Group in 2019; Nexstar then traded KCPQ to Fox as part of an exchange of Fox affiliates in three cities.

==History==
===As KMO-TV/KTVW===
In December 1952, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) simultaneously granted applications to broadcast on very high frequency (VHF) channels 11 and 13 in Tacoma; channel 13 was awarded to radio station KMO (1360 AM). The station began broadcasting as KMO-TV on August 2, 1953, from studios in Tacoma and a transmitter near Ruston.

KMO-TV briefly carried NBC programs until Seattle&#x27;s KOMO-TV began broadcasting on December 11. After that, KMO-TV&#x27;s output primarily consisted of local and syndicated programs. Within a year of starting the TV station, owner Carl E. Haymond—who had built KMO radio in 1926—sought to exit the broadcasting business, having already sold stakes in radio stations in California and Arizona. He first attempted to sell KMO radio and television together to the owners of Seattle radio station KAYO (1150 AM) for $350,000 (equivalent to $ in ); the unusually low purchase price was attributed to the station&#x27;s lack of network affiliation and its financial losses. The FCC indicated the necessity of a hearing to approve the sale due to the then-impermissible overlap of the Seattle and Tacoma radio stations&#x27; coverage areas; the deal was then scrapped several weeks later. In July, Haymond sold KMO-TV for $300,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to J. Elroy McCaw, a Seattle-based radio station owner.

With KMO-TV separated from KMO radio, the television station changed its call sign to KTVW in October 1954 and announced plans to open auxiliary offices in Seattle. The station also began airing Seattle Americans minor-league hockey, which was connected to KTVW in several ways. For two months, KTVW&#x27;s general manager served as the team&#x27;s president; when he resigned for a television job in Los Angeles, McCaw became the team&#x27;s sole owner. At this time, the Americans were the only professional hockey club to televise all their home games. Between 1955 and 1958, the station operated Seattle studios at 230 8th Avenue North; at one point, while the station relocated its Tacoma facility, all of channel 13&#x27;s live shows temporarily originated from Seattle.

McCaw tried to make several moves to improve channel 13&#x27;s positioning in the late 1950s. In an unusual arrangement, the station briefly aired the CBS network news in late 1957 when Tacoma&#x27;s then-CBS affiliate, KTNT-TV (channel 11), dropped the &quot;CBS Evening News with Douglas Edwards&quot; to make way for an expanded local news program. CBS, which wanted the newscast to continue to air in the Seattle market until KIRO-TV could sign on as the market&#x27;s CBS station (which it would do on February 8, 1958), arranged for the network hookup to bring the program to KTVW on an interim basis. In 1957, McCaw filed to move the transmitter from Tacoma to Queen Anne Hill in Seattle, which would have come with an upgrade to the maximum 316,000 watts; local residents objected to the erection of another TV tower in the area and to McCaw&#x27;s proposal to create a &quot;tower park&quot; that would have required the demolition of 75 to 80 homes. This proposal had stalled by 1958, when it was reported that the owners of Los Angeles station KCOP-TV, including Bing Crosby, were negotiating to buy KTVW and another independent station McCaw owned, Denver&#x27;s KTVR. Ultimately, the station increased its effective radiated power from the Ruston transmitter from 100,000 to 214,000 watts in 1960.

McCaw was regarded as frugal. Of his Denver station, it was remarked by Edwin James of &quot;Broadcasting&quot; that &quot;McCaw&#x27;s saving ways had been reflected in the station&#x27;s programming&quot;; in the 1950s, he owned WINS in New York and was an aggressive cost-cutter there. Local programs from KTVW during its 20-year run included a movie block hosted by Stu Martin; the afternoon children&#x27;s show &quot;Penny and Her Pals&quot;, hosted by LeMoyne Hreha; and, for one year, coverage of the Seafair hydroplane races. In 1967, when an engineer&#x27;s strike kept most of the other Seattle stations from broadcasting the event, KTVW stepped in to fill the void on short notice. In 1967, channel 13 began airing a six-hour stock market show, the first such program to broadcast on a VHF station. It originated, unlike KTVW&#x27;s other programming, from Seattle in studios in the Northern Life Tower. These shows, along with most of channel 13&#x27;s local programming, were temporarily suspended at the end of March 1970 as part of cutbacks it attributed to &quot;the economic slowdown&quot;. The cutbacks left Bob Corcoran, a talk show host, as KTVW&#x27;s sole on-air personality. KTVW was left airing, in the words of the television editor of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, &quot;scratchy old movies and ... Neanderthal reruns from the violence-action era of television&quot;. The business news programming briefly left the air that April before closing for good at the end of October 1970 along with the Northern Life Tower studio in Seattle.

In early 1969, plans were floated to convert KTVW to color, move the transmitter to Port Orchard, and relocate the studios to Seattle. The television editor of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; hailed the proposed changes as heralding the end of &quot;the funny station way over at the end of your television dial ... with the fuzzy picture and the funny, fuzzy programs and the fuzzy, old, awful movies&quot;. However, any hopes of an upgrade were dashed when McCaw died of a stroke that August. His indebted businesses struggled after his death; creditors made more than $12 million (equivalent to $ in ) in claims, after which the bank declared his estate insolvent, requiring the family to sell off his various holdings, including the family mansion and yachts.

===Blaidon ownership, financial woes, and the end of KTVW===
After nearly three years, on March 27, 1972, McCaw&#x27;s estate sold KTVW to the Seattle-based Blaidon Mutual Investors Corporation, named for co-owners Blaine Sampson and Don Wolfstone, for $1.1 million (equivalent to $ in ). During the sale process, the stock market program—which had returned in 1971 after it reorganized under a new production company—stopped airing after channel 13 asked for more money for its air time in contract negotiations.

Wolfstone recognized that the station needed help if it were to become viable, telling a writer for the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; that &quot;there&#x27;s not much of a worse [station] in the country&quot;. Blaidon tried to turn KTVW around by boosting the station&#x27;s signal strength, acquiring first-run syndicated programming, and installing color-capable broadcast equipment (the station had broadcast exclusively in black-and-white until Blaidon bought it). Channel 13 premiered its new programming lineup with &quot;The Tony Visco Show&quot;, its flagship effort. This talk/entertainment show was hosted by Tony Visco, a Las Vegas lounge entertainer and singer, attempted to recreate a &quot;Tonight Show&quot;-style program. Don Wolfstone—the &quot;Don&quot; in &quot;Blaidon&quot;—brought in a Los Angeles producer/director to develop the show, which featured a live band on-set, and had hopes of flying in show-business guests from Los Angeles and later syndicating the program nationwide. After two months on-air, rising production costs forced Blaidon to relocate the program from a Tacoma restaurant to the station&#x27;s studios; channel 13 canceled &quot;The Tony Visco Show&quot; before the year ended. Another new program launched under Blaidon was an afternoon cartoon show hosted by local actor Mike Lynch, playing a &quot;superhero&quot; character for whom viewers were asked to suggest a name; the winning entry was &quot;Flash Blaidon&quot;. Despite KTVW&#x27;s improved programming and ratings that at times were competitive with KTNT-TV, national advertisers failed to materialize. &quot;The News Tribune&quot; described the station, in retrospect, as &quot;a down-at-the-heels purveyor of old movies and used-car commercials&quot;.

At the end of 1973, Blaidon filed to sell channel 13 to the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) of Portsmouth, Virginia; the filing alone signaled trouble, given that at the time, the FCC barred selling a station in less than three years of ownership unless the buyer demonstrated it was facing financial hardship. The station&#x27;s remaining live programming, such as &quot;Flash Blaidon&quot;, was canceled. Over the course of 1974, KTVW&#x27;s financial position deteriorated. On January 15, 40 employees staged a walk-out, forcing the station to go off the air, complaining about not having been paid in nearly four weeks. After they were paid by cashier&#x27;s check, channel 13 resumed operations the next day, but employees remained skeptical of Blaidon&#x27;s financial condition. By the end of January, Blaidon had pleaded with the FCC to expedite approval of the CBN transfer; Wolfstone expected the Internal Revenue Service to lock up his Seattle office for failing to pay withholding taxes in the second half of 1973.

The FCC approved the CBN transaction, but the buyer had second thoughts about the $5.1 million (equivalent to $ in ) purchase price of channel 13 and asked for several time extensions to consummate the purchase. In July, MCA Television, among KTVW&#x27;s largest creditors, successfully petitioned for the appointment of a receiver to manage the station&#x27;s affairs. Despite a brief improvement in financial position when the receiver separated KTVW from Blaidon, the CBN sale fell apart over its refusal to assume all of the television station&#x27;s liabilities. The bankruptcy court approved a second offer from the Suburban Broadcasting Company, which owned WSNL in Patchogue, New York, but this deal collapsed, as Suburban also refused to assume the station&#x27;s liabilities. On December 12, 1974, at 5:10 p.m., KTVW was airing a rerun of &quot;Batman&quot; when Bruce Clements, a court-appointed trustee in charge of its affairs, ordered the station to go off the air at 5:30 upon that program completing its airing.

By the end of January 1975, the bankruptcy court was entertaining two &quot;very firm offers&quot; for the station. In 1976, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Blaidon, alleging that they had sold stock to non-Washington residents without SEC approval and issued misleading financial reports to prospective investors in the company.

===KCPQ: The Clover Park years===

When the bankruptcy court revealed the identity of the winning bidder for channel 13&#x27;s transmission site—the studio equipment having been sold at a sheriff&#x27;s sale—the local television community was shocked to learn that the buyer would be the Clover Park School District. Clover Park had operated KPEC-TV, an educational station on ultra high frequency (UHF) channel 56, since April 1960; it was one of the South Sound&#x27;s two educational TV stations, alongside KTPS-TV (channel 62), owned by Tacoma Public Schools. By 1975, KPEC-TV&#x27;s UHF equipment, which had been in service for more than a decade, was aging and needed replacement. It was more cost-effective to replace the channel 56 physical plant with KTVW, a high-power VHF station that could reach more western Washington homes and schools. A booster group for KTPS, the fledgling Trinity Broadcasting Network, and a commercial group headed by Stan Naccarato, manager of the Tacoma Twins, also bid.

Clover Park won the station for a final cost of $378,000 (equivalent to $ in ), with KSTW (the former KTNT-TV) owner Gaylord Broadcasting providing $250,000 of that total in what was viewed as a move to make KSTW the only independent in the market. Transmitter testing took place in November 1975, with channel 13 repeating the KPEC-TV signal; eventually, a new microwave link would be used to feed programming from channel 56&#x27;s existing studios to the channel 13 transmitter near Ruston. The call letters were changed to KCPQ-TV and the license modified to noncommercial before channel 13 returned to the air on January 4, 1976; the microwave link was not ready, so KPEC-TV remained in service until it was. The new KCPQ also aired some programming produced by KTPS.

Programming in the Clover Park era, which included PBS material, represented a continuation of KPEC-TV&#x27;s former service and originated from its existing Lakewood studios. The transmitter upgrade also attracted a high-profile name: Jim Harriott, who had been the highest-paid anchor in local TV news at KING-TV and who took a pay cut to come to channel 13 and helm public affairs programming. Harriott soon left when KIRO-TV offered him a job.

===From Clover Park to Kelly===
KPEC-TV had turned a profit prior to the channel 13 move, a rarity among educational TV stations. Two simultaneous events in 1978 prompted the district to reconsider its ownership of a television station. The Washington State Legislature—which KPEC-TV and later KCPQ covered for the state&#x27;s public television stations—approved plans to fully fund basic education at the state level, which would change channel 13 into a financial drain on the school system. For instance, Clover Park would stop receiving $3.5 million a year in federal funds for educating military dependents; this money would instead go to the state, making the $600,000 in annual station maintenance costs (equivalent to $ in ) a &quot;luxury&quot;. Meanwhile, portions of Clover Park High School were condemned, but voters rejected four separate bond initiatives that would have funded the reconstruction of the high school and taken students out of portable classrooms. The school board stated that annual losses from operating KCPQ reached $500,000.

In late 1978, the Clover Park School District received a $6 million offer from two investors from Tucson, Arizona: Gene Adelstein and Edward Berger, owners of that city&#x27;s independent KZAZ-TV. Adelstein and Berger were looking to expand; already in the early stages of a bid to build a new station in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the pair saw the Seattle–Tacoma market as having recovered from the market conditions that claimed KTVW four years prior and as being overserved by educational stations. They also felt that the Tacoma area alone represented a market of similar size to Tucson. Channel 13 then attracted another buyer who topped the Adelstein–Berger bid. In January 1979, the school board accepted an offer from Kelly Broadcasting, owners of KCRA-TV in Sacramento, California, to buy KCPQ from the Clover Park School District for $6.25 million (equivalent to $ in ). This purchase price was financed by Kelly Broadcasting&#x27;s sale, earlier that year, of two radio stations in Sacramento.

The sale was met with stiff protests and a petition to deny led by members of the station&#x27;s advisory board, organized as &quot;Save our Station 13&quot;. After the approval of a settlement between this group and Kelly that included a $450,000 gift (equivalent to $ in ) from the buyer for public television and the donation of the Ruston tower to KTPS, KCPQ ceased educational broadcasting on February 29, 1980, and the station went silent for a major technical overhaul. While KCPQ would continue to use Clover Park&#x27;s studio space, the transmitter was relocated to Gold Mountain, a peak located west of Bremerton, where the station erected a new tower; this enabled channel 13 to increase its signal footprint across western Washington.

After more than eight months and several delays, KCPQ returned to the air—and to commercial operation as the Seattle market&#x27;s second independent station—on November 4, 1980, when it adopted the Q13 moniker (it was also called &quot;The New 13&quot; early on); on opening night, it counterprogrammed election returns on the network affiliates with the movie &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;. Channel 13 represented a challenge that brought Bob Kelly, who with his brother had owned KCRA, out of semiretirement; disenchanted with network television, he had turned his attention to other Kelly family ventures. Among the new KCPQ&#x27;s launch programs were a nightly 8 p.m. movie, game shows, and a local children&#x27;s show, &quot;Captain Sea-Tac&quot;. John Komen, a political reporter, was the only holdover from the public station&#x27;s programming.

KCPQ grew quickly in its first five years. What started as a station heavy on movies and branded as &quot;The Northwest Movie Channel&quot; expanded to include college sports (including Washington and Washington State football) and, for a time, a full local newscast. When KSTW opted not to join the new Fox network in 1986, the affiliation went to KCPQ that June ahead of its launch on October 9; of the first 79 stations to affiliate with Fox, it was among the 13 on the VHF dial. In February 1990, KCPQ signed a three-year deal with Buena Vista Television to carry &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot;, spurning Fox&#x27;s own children&#x27;s lineup which launched that fall. This led to a threat from Fox to strip KCPQ of its affiliation if it did not commit to running Fox Kids in sequence beginning in 1992, as well as an antitrust lawsuit between Buena Vista and Fox, which Buena Vista alleged was coercing affiliates to air its children&#x27;s programming in a restraint of trade. Fox ultimately relented on its pressure, but KCPQ dropped the &quot;Disney Afternoon&quot; block in the fall of 1993.

===Later Kelly ownership and sale to Tribune===
The second half of the 1990s was a time of major changes at channel 13. In 1995, Kelly Broadcasting bought a former candy factory on Westlake Avenue along Lake Union in Seattle which would be renovated and expanded to house KCPQ&#x27;s operations. Even though Bob Kelly lived in Tacoma, the company made the decision to move out of the South Sound and into a space more than twice the size of the prior studio and closer to the bulk of market activity. On September 13, 1997, KCPQ moved its studios to the new, $30 million Seattle facility, retaining only a small sales office in the city of license of Tacoma. This marked the end of television broadcasting from the Clover Park studios after more than 20 years on channel 13 and more than 35 since the founding of KPEC-TV.

There were also changes in ownership. In 1997, Kelly Broadcasting experienced an internal changing of the guard, as Bob Kelly and his son Chris sold their stakes in Kelly to family members Jon and Greg Kelly and KCPQ general manager Roger Ottenbach. Not long after, the family company decided to exit an increasingly consolidated television business. In August 1998, Kelly Broadcasting announced the sale of its Sacramento television business to Hearst-Argyle Television; the next day, it sold KCPQ to the Meredith Corporation, which immediately traded it to the Tribune Company in exchange for Tribune&#x27;s Atlanta station, WGNX. The swap made sense for both companies; WGNX was the only CBS affiliate owned by Tribune, whose portfolio otherwise consisted of Fox and The WB affiliates, while Meredith owned several CBS outlets in top-25 markets. Following the purchase of channel 13, Tribune merged KCPQ&#x27;s operations with those of KTWB-TV (channel 22, now KZJO), which Tribune had acquired the year prior; the two stations became co-owned in 1999, after the FCC began to allow same-market duopolies.

On August 1, 2001, KCPQ began digital broadcasting on channel 18. KCPQ shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 13, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 18 to VHF channel 13 for post-transition operations.

===Fox seeks a station in Seattle===

The size of the Seattle market and its status as an NFL football city led Fox to covet owning a station there. By 1997, it had already made two rejected offers to buy KCPQ.

KCPQ first came in danger of losing its Fox affiliation in February 1997, when Fox Television Stations was reported to be in negotiations to acquire then-UPN affiliate KIRO-TV from Belo Corporation. Belo had just acquired the Providence Journal Company and KING-TV, requiring it to dispose of KIRO. Fox was reportedly dissatisfied with KCPQ, which was described by one observer as being &quot;recalcitrant&quot;. The trade with Belo never materialized; KIRO was ultimately sold to Cox Broadcasting. The Seattle Seahawks moved in 2002 from the American Football Conference to the National Football Conference, to which Fox holds the rights for most games. In June 2014, Fox reached a deal with Cox to trade its stations in Boston and Memphis for Cox&#x27;s Fox affiliate, KTVU, and associated independent KICU in San Francisco; Fox was also reportedly considering a deal to acquire KIRO, which would have displaced the Fox affiliation from KCPQ. In 2013, Fox had made a similar move in Charlotte, North Carolina (home market of the Carolina Panthers), exercising an option to buy WJZY and move its affiliation there.

In September 2014, the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that Fox was planning to acquire KCPQ from Tribune in exchange for its Chicago MyNetworkTV station WPWR-TV—which would have created a duopoly with WGN-TV in that city. On September 23, Tribune revealed that Fox had sent a notice terminating its affiliation with KCPQ effective January 17, 2015; in a statement, Tribune noted that discussions between the two companies were still ongoing. Days earlier, on September 19, Fox had struck a deal to buy KBCB, a station in Bellingham, for $10 million; the purchase, submitted for FCC approval on October 3, was described as a &quot;strategic option&quot; for Fox by an insider. Naming KBCB as Fox&#x27;s Seattle affiliate would have had immediate complications for Fox&#x27;s distribution in the market, as the Bellingham station provides a marginal signal to Seattle proper. By the time the KBCB purchase was disclosed, talks between Tribune and Fox had deteriorated; a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; report on October 7 stated that Fox no longer planned to include WPWR in a potential swap for KCPQ.

Fox announced on October 17, 2014, that Tribune had agreed to extend its affiliation agreement for KCPQ through July 2018 and pay increased reverse compensation fees to Fox for the broadcasting of its programming beginning in January 2015. Shortly thereafter, Fox&#x27;s purchase of KBCB was abandoned and was dismissed by the FCC on November 20, 2014.

===Sinclair sale attempt; acquisition by Nexstar and Fox===

Tribune Media agreed to be sold to Sinclair Broadcast Group on May 8, 2017, for $3.9 billion and the assumption of $2.9 billion in debt held by Tribune. As Sinclair already owned KOMO-TV and KUNS-TV, KCPQ was among 23 stations identified for divestment in order to meet regulatory compliance for the merger. Sinclair agreed to purchase KZJO and sell KCPQ to Fox Television Stations as part of a $910 million deal; Howard Stirk Holdings additionally agreed to purchase KUNS-TV. Lead FCC commissioner Ajit Pai publicly rejected the deal in July 2018 after details of Sinclair&#x27;s proposed divestitures came to light; weeks later, Tribune terminated the merger agreement with Sinclair, nullifying both transactions.

Tribune Media agreed to be acquired by Nexstar Media Group for $6.9 billion in cash and debt on December 3, 2018. Following the merger&#x27;s completion on September 19, 2019, Fox Television Stations purchased KCPQ and KZJO as part of a $350 million deal, with Fox citing KCPQ&#x27;s status as the broadcaster of most Seahawks home games as the impetus for the transaction. The sale was completed on March 2, 2020. After its acquisition by Fox, KCPQ dropped the Q13 moniker and rebranded to &quot;Fox 13&quot; on September 26, 2021, conforming with the branding of other Fox-owned stations.

==Local programming==
===Newscasts===
The first local news service on channel 13 operated when the station was KMO-TV in 1953; the next time channel 13 attempted a regular local newscast was in 1981, when the station aired regular news updates, expanding briefly by running a half-hour 10 p.m. newscast by the mid-1980s. This news operation could not compete with the more established 10 p.m. news on then-independent KSTW and was axed in June 1986 as part of economic cutbacks by the station.

In 1991, KIRO-TV pitched KCPQ management on the idea of producing a 10 p.m. newscast for the station; channel 13 &quot;wasn&#x27;t ready&quot; for the venture, per KIRO-TV news director John Lippman, and KTZZ aired it instead, lasting until 1993. By 1997—as the Fox network had added a national news service and more of its affiliated stations were adding newscasts, and after KCPQ had relocated to the larger Seattle studios—KCPQ began planning to start up a newscast of its own. As a potential stopgap, KCPQ considered airing a 10 p.m. newscast from KIRO-TV, which at that time was preparing to switch back from UPN to CBS and was shopping the 10 p.m. hour to other local stations. While KCPQ reached an initial agreement to air the KIRO newscast for three years, minutes from signing the contract, an impasse was reached over a &quot;deep philosophical issue&quot;: the length of the contract, because KCPQ wanted a term of no more than 18 months before it would start up its own newscast.

After no agreement could be reached with KIRO, Kelly decided to re-launch the station&#x27;s news division (and newscast) independently and hired Todd Mokhtari, producer of KCRA-TV&#x27;s morning and evening newscasts, to be the news director for a new 10 p.m. newscast. &quot;Q13 Reports&quot; began airing on January 18, 1998, initially running as a half-hour from Sunday to Thursday nights; the broadcast debuted without its lead anchor, Leslie Miller, a Canadian who was still awaiting a work permit and wound up not debuting until April. The station benefited from the decision of Paramount Stations Group to drop KSTW&#x27;s competing newscast after 21 years on air in December 1998.

By early 1999, the station was beginning to contemplate an expansion into morning news. In January 2000, the morning show debuted, with Christine Chen—a former KSTW anchor who worked at KCPQ on a freelance basis for nearly a year—selected as its first anchor.

After adding a 9 p.m. newscast on KMYQ (now KZJO) in 2008, KCPQ expanded into early evening news in the 2010s with 4 and 5 p.m. programs added. A half-hour 11 p.m. newscast followed in 2014 when the revival of &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; was canceled. By 2021, KCPQ was producing 54 hours of locally produced newscasts weekly, with 11 hours each weekday. This was further expanded by the addition of a 6 p.m. news hour in January 2022. In April 2022, KCPQ relaunched its morning show as &quot;Good Day Seattle&quot;, adopting the &quot;Good Day&quot; title used by other Fox-owned stations.

===Non-news programming===
The station produces a local program on law enforcement and crime news, &quot;The Spotlight with David Rose&quot;, which airs every Friday at 11:00 p.m. The program began production in 2008 as &quot;Washington&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, a local version of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;.

KCPQ has two regular sports programs: the Sunday night &quot;Seattle Sports Live&quot; and the weeknight &quot;Washington Sports Wrap&quot;, the latter of which debuted in 2024.

KCPQ became the local broadcast partner of the Seattle Seahawks in 2012, airing preseason games and team features; KING-TV, which lost the partnership to KCPQ, regained it in 2022. Beginning in 2014, KCPQ and KZJO became the broadcast home for locally televised Seattle Sounders FC matches; while all the matches were carried on KZJO, KCPQ aired two specials on the team each year. In 2016, KCPQ and KZJO began broadcasting locally televised games of the Seattle Storm of the WNBA; initially starting with 15 home games on channel 22 in 2016, KZJO was slated to carry 29 games in the 2023 season plus six more on KCPQ. In 2023, KCPQ and KZJO entered into a content partnership with the Seattle Kraken hockey team which includes a weekly show on the team, titled &quot;What&#x27;s Kraken?&quot;.

===Notable former on-air staff===
*Peter Alexander — reporter and anchor
*Christine Chen — anchor
*Ron Corning — anchor
*Stanley Kramer — movie host (1980s)
*Don Poier — sports play-by-play (1980s)

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

KCPQ carries a subchannel belonging to KONG, one of Seattle&#x27;s two ATSC 3.0 television stations. In exchange, KCPQ is carried in ATSC 3.0 on the KONG multiplex.

KCPQ&#x27;s main channel is also simulcast on KZJO&#x27;s transmitter as channel 22.2, which together with the digital replacement translator at that site makes the signal more accessible to viewers using UHF-only antennas and to viewers who receive a stronger signal from its transmitter in the Capitol Hill area.

===Translators===
KCPQ is rebroadcast on three translators outside of the Seattle metropolitan area as well as a digital replacement translator co-sited with KZJO in Seattle:

* Aberdeen: 
* Centralia, Chehalis: 
* Seattle: (RF 22)
* Wenatchee:

<text>Count Alexander Petrovich Izvolsky or Iswolsky (, in Moscow – 16 August 1919 in Paris) was a Russian diplomat remembered as a major architect of Russia&#x27;s alliance with Great Britain during the years leading to the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. As Foreign Minister, he assented to Austria-Hungary&#x27;s annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908 in exchange for Austrian support for the opening of the Turkish Straits to Russian warships. In the resultant Bosnian Crisis of 1908–1909 the Powers did not accept the opening of the Straits. Izvolsky, publicly humiliated and destroyed by the debacle, resigned as Foreign Minister
in 1910.

==Early life and career==
Izvolsky came from an aristocratic family of Russian descent. He graduated from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum with honours, and shortly thereafter married Countess von Toll, whose family had far-reaching connections at court. Through these connections, he joined the Foreign Ministry, where Prince Lobanov-Rostovsky became his patron.

Izvolsky served as Russia&#x27;s ambassador to the Vatican, followed by posts in Belgrade, Munich, and Tokyo (from 1899). In Tokyo, Izvolsky urged a peaceful accommodation with the rising power of Imperial Japan over Korea and Manchuria. He assisted Japanese former Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi arrange a trip to St. Petersburg in 1902 in an effort to defuse increasing tensions. The efforts incurred the wrath of Tsar Nicholas II, and Izvolsky found himself transferred to Copenhagen from 1903. From that posting, he continued to press for a diplomatic settlement with Japan before and during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905.

He served as Russia&#x27;s Foreign Minister between April 1906 and November 1910.

== Anglo-Russian alliance ==

In the wake of the disastrous Russian-Japanese War and the Russian Revolution of 1905, Izvolsky was determined to give Russia a decade of peace. He believed that it was Russia&#x27;s interest to disengage from the conundrum of European politics and to concentrate on internal reforms. A constitutional monarchist, he undertook the reform and modernization of the Foreign Ministry.

In the realm of more practical politics, Izvolsky advocated a gradual rapprochement with Russia&#x27;s traditional foes - Great Britain and Japan. He had to face vigorous opposition from several directions, notably from the public opinion and the hard-liners in the military, who demanded a revanchist war against Japan and a military advance into Afghanistan. His allies in the government included Pyotr Stolypin and Vladimir Kokovtsov. He concluded the Russo-Japanese Agreement of 1907 to improve relations with Japan.

Having been approached by King Edward VII during the Russo-Japanese War with a proposal of alliance, he made it a primary aim of his policy when he became Foreign Minister, feeling that Russia, weakened by the war with Japan, needed another ally besides France, which resulted in the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907.

== Bosnian crisis ==
Another primary objective was to realize Russia&#x27;s long-standing goal of opening (i.e., permitting free transit, without prior conditions; and in exclusive right to Russia) the Bosporus and the Dardanelles (known jointly as the &quot;Straits&quot;) to Russian warships, giving Russia free passage to the Mediterranean and making it possible to use the Black Sea Fleet not just in the coastal defense of her Black Sea territory; but also in support of her global interests.

In one of the secret articles of the renewed League of the Three Emperors of 1881, Austria-Hungary had asserted the right &#x27;to annex Bosnia and Herzegovina at whatever moment she shall deem opportune&#x27;, and the claim was repeated intermittently in Austro-Russian agreements. This was not contested by Russia, but St Petersburg maintained the right to impose conditions. Izvolsky, with the support of Tsar Nicholas II proposed that the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina be exchanged for Austro-Hungarian support for improved Russian access to the Turkish Straits. Izvolsky met with the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister, Baron (later Count) Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal, at the Moravian castle of Buchlov on September 16, 1908, and there agreed to support Austria&#x27;s annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in exchange for Austria-Hungary&#x27;s assent to the opening of the Straits to Russia; and to support such an opening, at any subsequent diplomatic conference.

Aehrenthal&#x27;s announcement of the annexation on 5 October 1908, secured through alterations of the terms of the Treaty of Berlin at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, occasioned a major European crisis. Izvolsky denied having reached any agreement with Aehrenthal. He subsequently denied any foreknowledge of Aehrenthal&#x27;s intentions and tried unsuccessfully to have a meeting called to deal with the status of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The &quot;impasse&quot; in diplomacy was resolved only by the &quot;St Petersburg note&quot; of March 1909 in which the Germans demanded that the Russians at last recognize the annexation and urge Serbia to do likewise. If they did not, German Chancellor Bülow suggested, there was the possibility of an Austrian war on Serbia and the further direct possibility that the Germans would release the documents proving Izvolsky&#x27;s connivance in the original annexation deal. Izvolsky backed down at once. Reviled by Russian pan-Slavists for &quot;betraying&quot; the Serbs, who felt Bosnia should be theirs, the embittered Izvolsky was eventually dismissed from office.

Historiography has traditionally laid most blame for the annexation crisis at Aehrenthal&#x27;s door. The historian Christopher Clark however, in his 2012 study of the causes of the First World War &quot;The Sleepwalkers&quot;, has challenged this view: &quot;the evidence suggests that the crisis took the course it did because Izvolsky lied in the most extravagant fashion in order to save his job and reputation. The Russian foreign minister had made two serious errors of judgement [firstly] that London would support his demand for the opening of the Turkish Straits to Russian warships - [and] he grossly underestimated the impact of the annexation on Russian nationalist opinion - [when] - he got wind of the press response in St Petersburg, he realized his error, panicked, and began to construct himself as Aehrenthal&#x27;s dupe.&quot; The years following the annexation crisis, with an atmosphere of increased &#x27;chauvinist popular emotion&#x27; and with a sense of humiliation in a sphere of vital interest, saw the Russians launch a substantial programme of military investment.

== Later life ==
Upon becoming ambassador in Paris in 1910, Izvolsky devoted his energies to strengthening Russia&#x27;s anti-German alliance with both the French Third Republic and the United Kingdom and encouraging Russian rearmament. When World War I broke out, he is reputed to have remarked, &quot;C&#x27;est ma guerre!&quot; (&quot;This is my war!&quot;).

After the February Revolution, Izvolsky resigned but remained in Paris, where he was succeeded by Vasily Maklakov. He advocated for Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War and wrote a book of memoirs before his last illness.

Shortly before his death, Isvolsky sat up and, greatly to their shock, he told his two children, &quot;If I die, I do not wish to be buried in the Russian Orthodox Church. Let your mother&#x27;s Protestant pastor read the funeral prayers.&quot;

His daughter, though shocked, later attributed her father&#x27;s words to, &quot;the long-repressed bitterness he had felt, at seeing the abject subservience of the Orthodox Hierarchy to the Tsar, and the corrupting influence of Rasputin.&quot;

Alexander Isvolsky died at Biarritz on November 16, 1919. In keeping with his wishes, a funeral service was read over his body by a Protestant minister. His children, however, also arranged for a Panikhida to be offered for Isvolsky at the local Russian Orthodox Cathedral. A Tridentine Requiem Mass was also offered for Isvolsky by a Roman Catholic priest and friend of the family.

== Family ==
His brother — Piotr Petrovich Izvolski (1863—1928) — was Oberprocurator of the Most Holy Synod until he resigned, allegedly in protest over the growing influence of Grigory Rasputin over appointments to the Church Hierarchy. After emigrating to France, he was ordained to the Orthodox priesthood and became an archpriest.

Alexander Izvolsky married Countess Marguerite von Toll, a Baltic German noblewoman of great charm whose influence at court was impeded by her ignorance of the Russian language. Their son fought in the Dardanelles. Their daughter Hélène Iswolsky was received into the Russian Greek Catholic Church and became a prominent scholar and leader of the ecumenical movement, first as a White émigré in Paris and later as a member of the Catholic Worker Movement and close friend of Dorothy Day in the United States.

<doc id="739015" wikidata="Q5098757" url="?curid=739015" title="Chilean Traditional Universities">
<text>In Chile, universidades tradicionales (&quot;traditional universities&quot;) refer to universities founded before the 1980s. It usually includes universities derived from traditional ones. A more precise term is (Universities of the Rectors&#x27; Council).

== Overview ==

Chilean Traditional Universities is not a specific term since it reflects only the history of a given university and is not a valid description of the university itself or of the way that university is organized. For example, even though the Universidad Católica refers to itself as a &quot;traditional university&quot;, it is more correctly described as a &quot;private Catholic university&quot; (e.g. the Catholic University of Leuven), as the government, and the people in extension, do not intervene in the governance of the university.

This distinction was needed because the Pinochet regime changed the higher education system, effectively dismembering public universities (like the Universidad de Chile or the Universidad Técnica del Estado) and Catholic universities. This decision, which can be seen as a punitive action against highly &quot;unstable&quot; institutions, or as a mean for better control, also included the opening of the education market, effectively allowing any private citizen to establish a higher education institution. Several small private universities arose after this, most of them directly linked to the dictatorship government members.

These &quot;traditional&quot; universities receive state financial support through many means—even though many of these universities are not public—receiving as they do most of the better students and doing most of the research undertaken by Chilean universities.

== Current division or classification of traditional universities in Chile ==
These universities can be divided into two groups:

*Properly traditional universities, the eight universities existing in 1981: Universidad de Chile, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Universidad Austral de Chile, Universidad Católica del Norte, Universidad de Concepción, Universidad de Santiago de Chile (formerly Universidad Técnica del Estado) and Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María.
* Derivative universities: Universities formed by separating a faculty or campus from a traditional one or by merging two campuses, one belonging to Universidad de Chile and the other, to Universidad Técnica del Estado. For example, what now is the Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educación in 1981 was the Education Faculty of the University of Chile; the present-day Universidad de La Frontera in 1981 was the University of Chile, Temuco Campus, and the Technical University of the State, Temuco Campus; and the present Universidad Católica de la Santísima Concepción in 1991 was the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Talcahuano campus. The Universidad Tecnológica Metropolitana (known by its acronym, UTEM) was founded on August 30, 1993.

Currently, there are three types of universities in Chile, applicable to the traditional universities, and which classifies them according to specific characteristics:
* State-owned universities (&quot;universidades estatales&quot;). These are the Universidad de Chile, Universidad de Santiago de Chile and derivative universities, most of which were created in the 1980s from the regional campuses of the former two.
* Universities of the Catholic Church. Similarly to the regional &quot;estatales&quot;, some of these were created from the regional campuses of the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile in the 1970s, while others originated earlier as stand-alone universities.
* Three private universities, owned by non-profit foundations. These are the Universidad Austral de Chile and the Universidad de Concepción founded by the citizens respectively of Valdivia and Concepción, and the Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, created, originally in Valparaíso, by the last will and testament of Federico Santa María Carrera.

Twenty-five traditional universities are today grouped in the &quot;Consejo de Rectores&quot; (Rectors&#x27; Council). Since the 1970s, these universities have managed a common higher education admissions test known as the &quot;Prueba de Aptitud Académica&quot; (&quot;scholastic-aptitude test&quot;) and, since 2003, as the &quot;Prueba de Selección Universitaria&quot; (PSU, &quot;university-selection test&quot;). Some of the more academically accomplished and/or ambitious new private universities, dating from the 1980s and chiefly set up by political groupings, Catholic sects or entrepreneurs, subscribe to PSU for all undergraduate admissions.

<doc id="739017" wikidata="Q123369" url="?curid=739017" title="Archway, London">
<text>Archway is an area of north London, England, in the London Borough of Islington north of Charing Cross. It straddles the A1 and is named after a local landmark, the high, single-arched Highgate Archway Bridge which crossed the road in a cutting to the north. It has a modern commercial hub around Vantage Point (formerly Archway Tower) and Archway tube station.

==History==
===Toponymy===

Archway&#x27;s name developed in reference to the old bridge carrying Hornsey Lane from Highgate to Crouch End, over the cutting of Archway Road. The original, brick-built, single-arched bridge of 1813 was replaced in 1900 by the current cast-iron Hornsey Lane Bridge. The 1893 Ordnance Survey map shows the bridge simply as &quot;Highgate Archway&quot;. A few residents, especially those born and locally raised in the early 20th century, refer to the area with a definite article (as &quot;&quot;the&quot; Archway&quot;).

Seven bus routes in London terminate at &#x27;Archway&#x27;, the term having become mainstream after the tube station, originally called &quot;Highgate&quot;, was renamed &quot;Highgate (Archway)&quot; in 1939, and subsequently &quot;Archway (Highgate)&quot; in 1941, and &quot;Archway&quot; in 1947. The ecclesiastical parishes (once having had poor-relief vestries employing highwaymen, for example) before the laws that disestablished their secular components do not mention Archway. Those covering the area are parts of traditional parent parishes named &quot;Whitehall Park, Upper Holloway&quot;, &quot;St John the Evangelist, Upper Holloway&quot; and a very small part of a Highgate, Islington parish.

===Development===
The Archway Road is part of the A1 or Great North Road, one of the original toll roads. From 1813 to 1864, the cutting contained a toll gate, where travellers paid for the next stage of their journey, as is recorded by a plaque at 1 Pauntley Street, an apartment block. Highgate Hill, the road from Archway to Highgate village, was the route of the first motorised cable car in Europe. It operated from 1884 to 1909. Highgate tube station (later renamed &#x27;Highgate Archway&#x27; and subsequently just &#x27;Archway&#x27;) opened on 22 June 1907 as the northern terminus of the Highgate branch of the Northern Line.

===Local government===
The ancient parish of Islington stretched over three miles from its southern boundary to meet with the parish of Hornsey at its north. The area that became Archway is located at the northwestern part of this parish. The parish was government by the St Mary Islington open vestry. The vestry was incorporated by the Metropolis Management Act 1855 as an administrative vestry and the boundary with Hornsey to the north also became the northern limit of the London metropolitan district.

==Governance==
Archway is part of the Islington North Parliament constituency. It is mostly in the Islington ward of Junction, which is named after Junction Road and partly in the ward of Hillrise. Each ward elects three councillors to Islington London Borough Council.

==Demographics==
Archway has seen a significant shift in demographics through waves of migration and gentrification, and has a diverse population with a proportionally larger White British, Irish, Other White and Jewish populations compared to the London and Islington averages.

The demographics of the two wards which Archway falls (predominantly in) are as follows:

The Archway area has the highest percentages of Jews in Islington - at the 2021 Census the Archway East area was 2.9% Jewish, Archway West was 1.6% and Tufnell Park 2.8%. The community is largest in the Whitehall Park area (between Archway, Highgate and Crouch End) which is close to 10% Jewish.

The Junction ward has the 4th highest percentage of White Irish people in wards in London.

==Geography==

The Whittington Hospital forms a large site in the west of the area. Larger open spaces include Archway Park, Dartmouth Park, Hillside Park and Navigator Square. Archway forms part of the London post town within the N19 postcode district, served from the Royal Mail Upper Holloway Delivery Office.

Archway adjoins Highgate and Crouch End to the north, with Hornsey Lane forming the London Borough of Islington boundary with the London Borough of Haringey. In the west, is Dartmouth Park, with Dartmouth Park Hill forming the boundary with the London Borough of Camden. To the west of the point where the three boroughs meet at the top of Highgate Hill is Waterlow Park. South of Archway is Upper Holloway and Tufnell Park.

===Commercial===
Archway market place and Vantage Point, the tallest building in Archway, are next to the tube station.

The photograph for the cover of The Kinks&#x27; 1971 album &quot;Muswell Hillbillies&quot; was taken in the Archway Tavern.

==Transport==

===Rail and Underground===
The nearest London Underground station is Archway tube station on the Northern line. The nearest London Overground station is Upper Holloway.

===Bus routes===
Archway is served by the following bus routes: 4, 17, 41, 43 (24 hour), 134 (24 hour), 143, 210, 263, 390 (24 hour), C11 and W5. Also Night Bus routes N20, N41 and N271.

==Culture==
===Dick Whittington===
A legend perpetuated by the name of the hospital and a statue on the older street leading, beside the hospital, to Highgate records Dick Whittington, medieval Mayor of London failing to make his fortune in the city heard the Bow Bells (those of St Mary-le-Bow, a church on Cheapside) from here, a distance of leading to the later homage &quot;turn again Whittington, thrice Lord Mayor of London&quot;, inscribed on the supporting stone protected by railings. On top of the thick tablet, his cat of English folklore is cast in stone. A restored 1821 memorial stone topped with a small statue of Whittington&#x27;s Cat is known as the Whittington Stone and is next to a pub of the same name on Highgate Hill, a street in Archway. The memorial marks the legendary site where &#x27;Dick Whittington&#x27; Sir Richard&#x27;s folkloric alter ego, returning home discouraged after a disastrous attempt to make his fortune in the city, heard the bells of St Mary le Bow ring out, &#x27;Turn again Whittington, thrice Lord Mayor of London.&#x27; Seeing the building of a maternity hospital and drains for the poor of London during his lifetime, he left his wealth to a broad-based charity which continues into the 21st century. Pauntley Street takes its name from the village of Pauntley in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, traditionally regarded as Dick Whittington&#x27;s birthplace. The Whittington Hospital is also named after him.

===Irish population===
There has been a large Irish community in the area since the 1830s, before the mass migration of the Great Famine. Many of them worked in building railways and roads and became known as &quot;navigators&quot;. After the Second World War, the Irish community formed in the area continued to grow as the newly opened Whittington Hospital recruited nurses from Ireland. Although immigration slowed as the country became more prosperous, the Irish influence on the area can still be seen in pubs such as The Mother Red Cap, the supply of Irish newspapers in local newsagents and the naming of the pedestrian precinct as &quot;Navigator Square&quot;, after the Irish navigators who built many of the roads in the area.

<doc id="739036" wikidata="Q6335082" url="?curid=739036" title="KONG (TV)">
<text>KONG (channel 16) is an independent television station licensed to Everett, Washington, United States, serving the Seattle area. It is owned by Tegna Inc. alongside NBC affiliate KING-TV (channel 5). The two stations share studios at the Home Plate Center in the SoDo district of Seattle; KONG&#x27;s transmitter is located in the city&#x27;s Queen Anne neighborhood.

Plans for KONG dated as far back as the early 1980s, when a San Francisco–based investor group obtained the construction permit for a new station in Everett. The group secured the call sign KONG—over threats by KING-TV to sue—and set up a studio, but the station never launched. A dispute over the tower site on Cougar Mountain and difficulty securing financing scuttled the project. The permit was sold to Zeus Corporation of Washington and lay dormant until KING-TV agreed to program the new station in 1996. KONG went on the air in 1997, relying heavily on classic TV series for its programming. It has become a secondary conduit for local news and sports programming from KING-TV; the first newscast on KONG debuted in 1999, and over the years, teams including the Seattle SuperSonics, Seattle Storm, and Seattle Sounders FC aired their games on KONG. Presently, the station is the broadcast home for Seattle Reign FC and the Seattle Kraken. It is one of two ATSC 3.0 stations in the Seattle market.

==History==
===Early permit history===
In 1981, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) designated four applications for comparative hearing, all seeking the channel 16 allocation at Everett, from Oak Television of Everett; Unity Broadcasting Company of Washington State; Greater Everett Telecasters; and Channel 16, Inc. The designation followed a year of applications. At one point, FNI Communications—a subsidiary of First Northwest Industries, owner of the Seattle SuperSonics basketball team—applied. Channel 16, Inc., was part-owned by Jon Marple, owner of Everett radio station KRKO. Unity, a San Francisco–based group with almost entirely minority stockholders, was selected by administrative law judge Joseph Chachkin in November 1982 on account of its lack of other broadcast ownership and strongest integration of ownership and management.

Unity selected KONG as its proposed call sign. This triggered opposition from Seattle&#x27;s KING-TV and its owner, King Broadcasting, which believed that the two stations could cause confusion; KONG hoped that the original 1933 film &quot;King Kong&quot; could be its first program and planned to operate as an independent station with sports, movies, and reruns, from a main studio near Paine Field. Instead, KONG found itself bogged down for years in tower siting problems. It applied to the FCC to build a tower on Cougar Mountain, near Issaquah. The mast would be used by KRAB, which owned the land, and two other FM radio stations. Residents near the mountain protested, fearing that electromagnetic radiation could affect their health. King County initially required a more in-depth environmental review, but it received approval in April 1985. For years, KONG promised it would be on the air, but continued appeals of the tower siting decision and delays in securing financing held the station back. During this time, the Home Shopping Network looked at buying the unbuilt KONG.

The originally planned KONG never materialized. In 1989, a public auction was held for station equipment and supplies, which included a satellite dish and receiving equipment. The permit was sold to Zeus Corporation of Washington, owned by Walter Ulloa and Paul Zevnik, for $300,000.

===Under KING-TV management===
In August 1996, KING reached an agreement to program KONG under a local marketing agreement, with an option to buy if the FCC permitted duopoly ownership. It began broadcasting July 7, 1997. KONG&#x27;s programming relied heavily on classic TV series of the 1950s through 1980s with a &quot;campy&quot;, irreverent approach to presentation and imaging; a large KONG Gong served as a promotional device. Also present on the original schedule were programs from two cable services owned, like KING-TV, by the Belo Corporation: Northwest Cable News and Food Network. Nancy Guppy, a cast member on KING-TV&#x27;s comedy show &quot;Almost Live!&quot;, doubled as a host appearing between shows. When the FCC permitted duopolies in November 1999, Belo bought KONG from Zeus.

KONG launched a digital signal on February 1, 2002, and shut down its analog signal on June 12, 2009. The digital signal on channel 31 continued to broadcast. KONG was one of two ATSC-M/H Mobile DTV model stations in Seattle alongside KOMO-TV.

Belo, including KING-TV and KONG, was acquired by the Gannett Company in 2013. Gannett split its print and broadcast operations into separate companies, the latter named Tegna, in 2015. KING and KONG moved their operations from the longtime KING studios on Dexter Avenue to Home Plate Center in 2016.

== Local programming ==

===Newscasts===

KONG began airing local newscasts on February 1, 1999, with the debut of the half-hour &quot;KING 5 News at 10&quot;, originally anchored by Lori Matsukawa. The newscast, postponed from a late 1998 start when the news director resigned, brought Seattle back to having competing newscasts in the time period (opposite KCPQ) after KSTW folded its news department months prior. Originally a weeknight-only newscast, it expanded to seven nights a week in January 2001; a 7 p.m. newscast was dropped because of sports preemptions.

In 2004, KONG launched a morning show, originally named &quot;Seattle Live&quot;, to compete with KCPQ. On September 9, 2013, KONG added a weeknight 9 p.m. newscast from KING.

===Sports===
Seattle SuperSonics basketball games began airing in 1999, and KONG became the primary local television broadcaster for the team over the next two seasons, with 36 games in 1999–2000 and the entire 56-game local TV slate starting in 2000-2001. In 2000, the expansion Seattle Storm of the WNBA began airing a package of local telecasts on KONG. The SuperSonics and Storm departed for FSN Northwest in 2004, when the NBA team opted to move all its games to cable and get out of the production business. In 2009–2010, after the SuperSonics left for Oklahoma City, KONG and one of KING-TV&#x27;s subchannels aired a package of Portland Trail Blazers basketball games.

KING and KONG were the first broadcast partner for Seattle Sounders FC when the club debuted in Major League Soccer in 2009. The stations lost the rights to KCPQ and KZJO in 2014.

In 2017, after KIRO-TV discontinued its 31-year-old tradition of full-day coverage of the H1 Unlimited Seafair Cup, full-day coverage of the races moved to KONG the next year in association with SWX Right Now.

KONG returned to major league sports broadcasts by way of two deals announced in April 2024. One deal made KONG the home of Seattle Reign FC women&#x27;s soccer, with a local TV schedule of 11 matches. The second made KONG the home of all non-nationally televised Seattle Kraken hockey games starting in the 2024–25 season, replacing Root Sports Northwest. The games will also stream on Amazon Prime Video.

In addition to live sports, KONG airs a weekly show, &quot;Seahawks Central&quot;, as part of KING-TV&#x27;s rights deal for Seattle Seahawks preseason games and coverage. The show debuted in 2022 as the rights moved back to KING from KCPQ.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
KONG is one of two ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) stations in the Seattle area, having switched to 3.0 transmission on December 15, 2020. The station&#x27;s ATSC 1.0 channels are carried on the multiplexed signals of other Seattle television stations:

<doc id="739038" wikidata="Q7761603" url="?curid=739038" title="The Rotunda (University of Virginia)">
<text>The Rotunda is a building located on The Lawn on the original grounds of the University of Virginia. Thomas Jefferson designed it to represent the &quot;authority of nature and power of reason&quot; and modeled it after the Pantheon in Rome. Construction began in 1822 and was completed shortly after Jefferson&#x27;s death in 1826. The campus of the new university was unique in that its buildings surrounded a library (the principal function of the Rotunda) rather than a church, as was common at other universities in the English-speaking world. To many, the Rotunda symbolizes Jefferson&#x27;s belief in the separation of church and education, and represents his lifelong dedication to education and architecture. The Rotunda was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966, and is part of the University of Virginia Historic District, designated in 1971.

The collegiate structure, the immediate area around it, and Jefferson&#x27;s nearby home at Monticello combine to form one of only six modern man-made sites in the United States to be internationally protected and preserved as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO (the other five are the Old City of San Juan, the San Antonio Missions, Independence Hall, the Statue of Liberty, and the architectural works of Frank Lloyd Wright).

The original construction cost of the Rotunda was $57,773 ($992,792 in 2006 dollars). The building stands 77 feet (23.5 m) in both height and diameter.

==History==
===Design influences===
Jefferson&#x27;s design was influenced by the architectural drawings of Andrea Palladio and is an example of Palladian architecture. The direct source for Jefferson&#x27;s inspiration is believed to be a drawing of the Pantheon in the 1721 Leoni translation of Palladio, which Jefferson owned and referred to during the building process. While Jefferson used the detailed measurements of the Pantheon to guide the proportions of his Rotunda, the dimensions of his building are much smaller: the interior diameter of the Pantheon&#x27;s dome is 143 feet, whereas the exterior diameter of Jefferson&#x27;s dome is 77 feet, &quot;being half that of the Pantheon and consequently one fourth in area, and one eighth in volume.&quot;

B. Henry Latrobe first proposed the domed central building at the head of the Lawn in a letter to Jefferson dated July 17, 1817, and Latrobe&#x27;s influence on the design of the Rotunda is substantial. Jefferson&#x27;s Pavilion III also is based on a design drawing from Latrobe.

Jefferson also deferred to Palladio&#x27;s model for significant details of the building. In a letter to Thomas Appleton, then the United States consul in Liguria, Jefferson requested pricing for &quot;ten Corinthian capitals for columns of 32 I. diminished diam. and 8 do. half capitals of the same diam. for pilasters of 30 minutes projection from the wall, to be copied from those of the Rotunda, or Pantheon, of Rome, as represented in Palladio.&quot;

===Design and construction===

During the Marquis de Lafayette&#x27;s grand tour of the United States in 1824 and 1825, the Marquis and former President James Madison dined with Thomas Jefferson in the Dome Room of the unfinished Rotunda at the university&#x27;s inaugural banquet, and Lafayette toasted Jefferson as the &quot;Father of the University of Virginia&quot;. This moved Jefferson, and he later had the phrase inscribed on his grave. A bust of Lafayette was given to the university in 1904 by the Government of France to honor the friendship between the two men. Today it stands in the North Oval Room.

The building was constructed with slave labor.

The university was the first to offer students specialization in the field of Astronomy, so Jefferson toyed with the idea of painting the interior of the Dome Room with images of the night sky to aid the students in their learning. He went so far as to begin designing a new mechanism with which students would be able to &quot;float&quot; through the air and study heavenly bodies from closer different viewpoints. They would also be equipped with a control to move the stars around the Dome. The idea was eventually abandoned but would have been the first planetarium in the United States. The Transit of Venus of 1882 was observed from the steps of the Rotunda, in a coordinated effort with McCormick Observatory.

===Alterations===

A structure called the Annex, also known as &quot;New Hall,&quot; was added to the north side of the Rotunda in 1853 to provide additional classroom space needed due to overcrowding. (A rare photograph of the Annex may be viewed at the University of Virginia&#x27;s online visual history collection.)

In 1895, the Rotunda was gutted by a fire that started in the Annex. University students saved what was, for them, the most important item within the Rotunda—a life-size likeness of Thomas Jefferson carved from marble that was given to the university by Alexander Galt in 1861. The students also rescued a portion of the books of the university library from the Dome Room, as well as various scientific instruments from the classrooms in the Annex.

Shortly after the fire, the university faculty recommended a program of rebuilding that called for the reconstruction of the Rotunda and the replacement of the lost classroom space of the Annex with a set of buildings at the south end of the Lawn. In the new design, the wooden dome was replaced with a fireproof tile dome by the Guastavino Company of New York in 1898–1899. The Rotunda was rebuilt with a modified design by Stanford White, a nationally known architect and partner in the New York City firm McKim, Mead, and White. Whereas Jefferson&#x27;s Rotunda had three floors, White&#x27;s had only two, but a larger Dome Room. The Annex was not rebuilt.

In 1976 during America&#x27;s Bicentennial, White&#x27;s Rotunda interior was gutted and rebuilt, at a cost of $2.4 million, to Jefferson&#x27;s original design. In the Bicentennial issue of the &quot;AIA Journal&quot;, the American Institute of Architects called Jefferson&#x27;s Rotunda, Lawn, and nearby home at Monticello &quot;the proudest achievement of American architecture in the past 200 years&quot;.

There is a plaque, on the south side of the Rotunda, listing the names of students and graduates of the university who were killed during the Civil War. Other plaques on the south side list those killed during World War I while plaques on the north side list those killed in World War II and the Korean War.

Today, doctoral students defend their dissertations in the North Oval Room, and many events (including monthly dinners for residents of the Lawn) are held inside the Dome Room. Other events are held on the steps of the Rotunda, which is also the traditional starting point for students streaking the Lawn.

In 2012, the university began an extensive construction project to repair and renovate the aging Rotunda. The first phase of the project replaced the Rotunda&#x27;s copper roof. Although the engineers were several months ahead of schedule, the roof remained as unpainted copper for the graduating class of 2013. During the renovation, a nineteenth-century chemistry laboratory was found within the walls on the bottom floor featuring a chemical hearth and a sophisticated ventilation system through a series of brick tunnels. The Rotunda reopened in September 2016.

==Legacy==

Buildings inspired by the Rotunda and Lawn include the expansive green spaces headed by Rotunda-like buildings built at Duke University in 1892, Johns Hopkins University in 1902, the University of Illinois in 1907, Rice University in 1910, Peabody College of Vanderbilt University in 1915, the Green at the University of Delaware in 1916, Killian Court at MIT in 1916 and the &quot;Grand Auditorium&quot; of Tsinghua University in Beijing built in 1917. Additionally, Dallas Hall at Southern Methodist University (SMU), Hendricks Chapel at Syracuse University, Florida State University College of Law, and Grawemeyer Hall at the University of Louisville were modeled after Jefferson&#x27;s Rotunda. The Sterling Divinity Quadrangle at Yale Divinity School (1932) was closely based on the Academical Village at the University of Virginia, but with the Marquand Chapel taking the place of the Rotunda.
The original campus at the University of Alabama was modeled after Jefferson&#x27;s Rotunda and Lawn. The Rotunda there, completed in 1833, also contained the university&#x27;s library. However, it and most of the other public campus buildings were burned as part of Wilson&#x27;s Raid during the American Civil War.

<doc id="739048" wikidata="Q5077203" url="?curid=739048" title="Charles Edward Wilson (businessman)">
<text>Charles Edward Wilson (November 18, 1886 – January 3, 1972) was a CEO of General Electric.

==Early life==
Wilson left school at the age of 12 to work as a stock boy at the Sprague Electrical Works, which was acquired by the General Electric Company. He took night classes to graduate from high school, and he worked his way up to the position of president of the corporation in 1939.

==Public service==
During World War II, Wilson served on the War Production Board as its executive vice-chairman in September 1942, supervising the huge U.S. war production effort. He resigned in August 1944 after a bitter dispute over jurisdiction with the Department of War and the Department of the Navy. Wilson stated at the time that the US must keep its economy mobilized for war to avoid another Great Depression. 

==General Electric career==
After returning to General Electric in 1945, Wilson began an anti-union campaign. He also served President Harry S. Truman as the chairman of the blue-ribbon President&#x27;s Committee on Civil Rights in 1946–47. The committee recommended new civil rights legislation to protect &quot;all parts of our population.&quot; In December 1950, Wilson left GE again to serve Truman as director of the new Office of Defense Mobilization, which imposed controls on the US economy during the Korean War, such as rationing raw materials for civilian production. This position became so powerful that the press began dubbing Wilson the &quot;co-president.&quot; After a bitter dispute with his own Wage Stabilization Board, which had recommended wage increases for unionized steel workers without his knowledge, Wilson resigned from his post in March 1952. He had intervened in the dispute to support the steel industry&#x27;s demand for price increases to offset the wage increases, only to see Truman back the WSB.

==Later life==
Wilson returned to General Electric briefly, before becoming chairman of the board of W.R. Grace &amp; Co. until his retirement in 1956. He then became the president of the People-to-People Foundation, a nonpartisan organization that promoted international friendship and understanding. John G. Forrest wrote in &quot;The New York Times, &quot;Charles Wilson is a big man by any standard, physical, moral, or mental.&quot;

==Personal life==

Wilson and his wife adopted their daughter, Margaret Wilson, from an orphanage when she was 18 years old. Margaret later married Hugh Pierce and they had one son, Charles Edward Wilson Pierce, named for his grandfather and father. Charles Wilson died in Westchester County, New York, in 1972, and his remains are interred in a private mausoleum in the Kensico Cemetery.

==Nickname==
He was nicknamed &quot;Electric Charlie&quot; to avoid being confused with Charles Erwin Wilson, US Secretary of Defense under President Dwight Eisenhower and earlier the Chairman of the General Motors Corporation, who was nicknamed &quot;Engine Charlie.&quot;

<text>Jinotega () (derived from Náhuatl: &quot;Xiotenko&quot; ‘place next to the jiñocuajo trees’) is the capital city of the Department of Jinotega in north-central Nicaragua.

The city is located in a long valley surrounded by the cool climate and Dariense Isabelia ridge located 142 km north of the capital Managua. In 2012, the Department of Jinotega had a total population of 417,372, of which 123,548 lived in the municipality. Of the total population, 50.5% are men and 49.5% are women, and almost 38.4% of the population lives in the urban area. Jinotega produces 80% of Nicaragua&#x27;s coffee, which is exported to the United States, Russia, Canada and Europe.

Within the city of Jinotega are several rivers and a lake. Lake Apanas, an artificial lake of 51 square kilometers, provides hydropower to much of the country. Although there is debate as to the origin of the name, Jinotega is colloquially known as &quot;The City of Mists&quot; (&quot;Ciudad de la Brumas&quot;) for the magnificent whisks of clouds continuously feathering through the top of the valley. Other generally accepted names are &quot;The Eternal City of Men&quot;, and the &quot;City of Eternal Men&quot;.

Jinotega is bordered to the 
* north by the municipalities of Santa María de Pantasma and Wiwili
* south by the municipalities of Matagalpa and Sébaco
* east by the municipalities of El Cua, Bocay, and Tuma La Dalia
* west by the municipalities of La Trinidad, San Rafael del Norte, La Concordia, and San Sebastian de Yali

The climate is subtropical and tropical in the high valleys, dry in summer, rainy in winter and cool in the mountains.

== Etymology ==
The name Jinotega is believed by some to derive from the Nahuatl word &quot;xinotencátl&quot;. Linguists disagree on the meaning of this word. Some interpret it as &quot;City of the Eternal Men&quot;, whereas others translate it as &quot;neighbors of the Jiñocuajo trees&quot;. The term probably comes from &quot;xiotl&quot;, originally from the word &quot;xiokwawtli&quot;, which means jiñocuabo or mangy tree; the ending &quot;-tenko&quot;, which means &quot;on the edge of or next to&quot;; and the demonym suffix &quot;-katl&quot;. Therefore, &quot;xiotenko&quot; means &quot;place next to the jiñocuabos&quot; and &quot;xiotenkatl&quot;, &quot;neighbor of the jiñocuajos&quot;. The ending &quot;-tenko&quot; or &quot;neighbors&quot; is similar in function to the ending &quot;ville&quot; or &quot;land&quot; in English.

The latter is probably the most accurate of the translations, because there is an abundance of the &quot;bursera simaruba&quot; trees in the region, which are today known as jiñocuajo or jiñocuabo trees, a balsamic tree to which the natives of Jinotega attributed great medicinal properties. The Nahuas and Chorotegas revered the jiñocuajo as a tree of eternity and wisdom.

According to historian Eddy Kühl Aráuz, the name Jinotega does not come from the Nahuatl language, since the indigenous people of this area (Jinotega, Matagalpa and Muy Muy) spoke the Misumalpa language, as they were not of Mesoamerican origin like the Mangues (Chorotegas) and the Nahua peoples who inhabited the Pacific area of present-day Nicaragua. However, despite Kühl&#x27;s claims, there are in fact Nahua people who inhabit Jinotega, therefore a Nahuatl etymology remains a possibility. The historian Julián Guerrero, in his work &quot;Jinotega Monograph&quot; affirms that the word Jinotega is Chorotegan.

According to the German linguist Walter Lehmann, the language of the indigenous people of Jinotega and Matagalpa belonged to the Macro-Chibcha family.

==History==
=== Pre-colonial era ===
The settlement of Jinotega was established in the middle of a cauldron-shaped mountainous valley by indigenous people in pre-Columbian times. There is quite a bit of controversy about its original settlers; for some historians, the natives of this region were descendants of the Mayangna people of the Chontales Department, from the Caribbean of the Atlantic coast; other believe the aborigines of the region were Chorotega-speaking people, and therefore, Mesoamericans. 
The chroniclers listed the first possible inhabitants of the central and northern part of the country as one or more of the following:

* Chontales according to the chronicler Oviedo.
* Uluas, a group of Cacaopera people, according to Alonso Ponce.
* Popoluca according to Fray Blas de Hurtado.
* Matagalpa according to Brinton, Lehmann and Noguera.

The government of Jinotega consisted of a king who was advised by a council of elders. Indigenous kings where called caciques as an umbrella term by the Spanish, although truthfully caciques were unique to the Taíno and kings were not called this term by Jinoteganos.

The religion was polytheistic; they had a pantheon of gods of the air, thunder, lightning, rain, harvest, and more.

Agriculture consisted mainly of the cultivation of corn, legumes, cocoa, and the harvest of roots and edible fruits. Corn was the staple of the diet. Among the animals they hunted for food were turkey, quail, agouti, guardatinaja (a species of agouti particular to Nicaragua) and deer.

The indigenous people of Jinotega wove their clothes using cotton, the bark fibers of certain trees, as well as leather, all colored with inks and dyes extracted from local plants and animals. They were well known in the region for their claywork and pottery, especially of domestic utensils. They also obtained and worked with gold, known for its malleability and beauty.

=== Colonial era ===
Professor Harvey Wells (1932-2009), a respected local educator and historian who taught at Colegio La Salle in Jinotega, claimed that when the Spanish colonization began in 1524, roughly 75% of the indigenous peoples of north central Nicaragua were part of the early immigration from Mexico and for that reason, he believed that Jinotega has its roots in the capital of the Mexica people, in Tenochtitlán.
A Spanish census in 1581 listed Jinotega as a completely indigenous town with no Spanish presence, however it was still claimed as Spanish territory and named &quot;San Juan de Jinotega&quot; in 1606 by a Catholic shaman named Juan de Albuquerque. Juan chose Saint John the Baptist as patron spirit at the city&#x27;s center, the place that is today the central park where the town hall is located.

In the mid-sixteenth century, the interpreters who accompanied the Spanish military and missionaries desired to nahualize the names in the region of Jinotega, but at least 80% of the place names remained in the Matagalpa language, such as names ending in lí (“river”), güina (“people”), cayán (“hill”), apa (“hill”), etc., which are very common in the central and northern region of the country.

Starting in 1690, the first Spanish settlers settled near the city. In 1703 the Spanish missioner Fray Margil de Jesús visited Jinotega and noted that there was still no permanent Spanish presence. He had a large cross placed on the highest point of Cerro Chirinagua, on the western outskirts of the city. Today it is a place for hiking, illuminated at night, called Cerro de la Cruz. By 1731 there were some permanent Spanish surnames listed in the census, like Gadea, Duarte, Altamirano, Castro, Alburquerque, and Fray Juan de Zeledon. Zeledon is said to have invited his nephews to the city, who have descendants who that still live there: some of them are Zeledon of La Concordia, Umure and Ocotal Espeso and Pacsila, idilic communities located between the cities of Matagalpa and Jinotega. On April 5, 1851, the city of Jinotega was elevated to the category of village by the government of Nicaragua.

In July 1872, the scientist Thomas Belt left Santo Domingo de Chontales in search of miners for the Nueva Segovia gold mines near the Honduran border. On this trip he visited Jinotega and called it by its original name, and not by &quot;Santas Rosas, San Juanes, Santos Tomases&quot; and explained that the inhabitants &quot;cling to their old names&quot; and not to the ones imposed by the Spanish. In other words, the Spanish name is &quot;San Juan&quot; and the true name is &quot;Jinotega&quot;.

On February 11, 1883, the title of town was granted to Jinotega. According to historians, the first car in the city belonged to the German Enrique Heinrich Gülke and the first women&#x27;s bicycle arrived in the city in 1933, as a gift from the German immigrant Luis Ludwig Frenzel to his daughter Hulda for her fifteenth birthday.

=== Modern era ===

The Jinotega region is perhaps the most war-torn region in Nicaragua&#x27;s history. Its remote location as well as its proximity to the border with Honduras made it a haven for rebel forces throughout the last seven decades. The most intense battles took place in the Department of Jinotega between 1927 and 1934 under Augusto C. Sandino and his troops (popularly known as &quot;los bandoleros&quot;) against the American occupation troops.

Later, at the end of the 1970s, Jinotega was a key battleground in the bitter war between the troops of Anastasio Somoza Debayle and the civilian rebel population. Starting on May 19, 1979, the &quot;Final Offensive&quot; of the Sandinista National Liberation Front&#x27;s Carlos Fonseca Amador Northern Front began against the Somoza Debayle regime. Somoza was defeated on July 19, 1979.

After a short period of peace, civil war began again between government troops of the new Sandinista regime and the Contra rebels who felt betrayed by the Sandinistas and were funded by the United States. In 1981, the mountainous area of the department was again the scene of a fratricidal war, this time between the Contras and carried out bloodily by the FSLN, emerging from anti-communist sentiment and dissatisfaction with the corruption of Sandino&#x27;s government, continuing the Nicaraguan Revolution.

==Economy==

Jinotega is a major supplier of coffee for Nicaragua and for other countries. The basic grains (corn, beans, and wheat), vegetables (tomato, lettuce, onion, cabbage, parsley, radish, celery, broccoli, potatoes, taro, carrot, cucumber), fruit (bananas), and livestock (cattle, pigs and goats) all contribute to its economy. There is also sizable cocoa production.

=== Coffee ===
At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the economy of Jinotega received a great boost with the cultivation of coffee, which attracted national and foreign entrepreneurs, particularly among the nationals of Granada, León, but also German foreigners and the British. One of the first and largest coffee producers in northern Nicaragua was the community of &quot;La Fundadora&quot; in the municipality of Jinotega run by a British man named Potter who owned these properties at the time. The hospitable climate and the dedication of its producers have allowed Jinotega coffee to reach some of the highest levels of quality in the world. Thus, Jinotega has won national and international competitions for excellence in coffee production, surpassing Matagalpa, Boaco, Estelí and the department of Madriz in quality; and internationally, Venezuela, Colombia and even Brazil. Contests have been organized in Jinotega, such as the Cup of Excellence, because this department is one of the most awarded for this contest at an international level, of which it has been the winner 5 times. Coffee cultivation is mainly represented by small and medium producers for 90%, the rest in the hands of large producers. The department produces 65% Nicaraguan coffee, high quality coffee thanks to the optimal agro-ecological conditions for its cultivation, which make Jinotega the capital of coffee. This product is exported to Canada, the United States, Europe and Russia.

=== Commerce ===
Between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the city of Jinotega was full of commerce: in the 19th century, the national government passed a law with the aim of motivating foreign investors to grow coffee in Nicaragua. English, German, Danish and North American entrepreneurs later settled in Jinotega. German businessman Heinrich (Henry) Gülke founded a Viennese-style casino. Both the furniture and the velvet curtains, the pool tables, the bowling alleys, the wheels of fortune, etc. They came directly from Germany. In the late 1920s, Mr. Gülke also brought the first motor vehicle to Jinotega, which was driven by Mr. Rafael Hernández.

In the mid-1960s, businessman Asunción (Chón) Molina Rodríguez set up a coffee and corn processing factory. His products included ground coffee, corn chips, and tortillas, all of which were exported throughout Central America, expertly vacuum-packed. The factory employed more than 200 people.

The coffee trade, known as the &quot;golden grain&quot;, like that of basic grains, depends mainly on intermediaries who are responsible for collecting the product, storing it and then looking for points of sale. The marketing of vegetables in the town has not changed for many years. Traded directly by the plantation, the produce is transported to markets to find buyers. The cattle are sold by the owners directly to the national market in the slaughterhouses of Managua, Chontales or Condega, who are in charge of exporting them.

== Infrastructure ==
The distribution of domestic energy, in charge of the company Distribuidora del Norte (DISNORTE), is interconnected to the national network. Hydroelectric energy generated by Centro América Plant supplies energy for much of the country. The plant has two turbines, each with a capacity of 25 MW (subject to a good winter).

Public lighting service covers only 90% of the city and only 30% in rural areas. In some rural communities, they do not have access to electricity, particularly in dry zones such as La Ermita de Saraguasca and nearby places located 5 kilometers west of Las Lomas, despite the Larreynaga and Central America Power Plant located just 5 kilometers away.

== Education ==
There are three universities in Jinotega, and one technical school:
;Public Universities
* Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Nicaragua León (UNAN)
* Universidad Popular de Nicaragua (UPONIC)

; Private University
* Universidad del Norte de Nicaragua (UNN).

<text>Arculf was a Frankish churchman who toured the Holy Land around 670. Bede claimed he was a bishop from Gaul (). According to Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; (V, 15), Arculf was shipwrecked on the shore of Iona on his return from his pilgrimage. He was hospitably received by Adomnán, the abbot of the island monastery from 679 to 704, to whom he gave a detailed narrative of his travels. Adomnán, with aid from some further sources, was able to produce &quot;De Locis Sanctis&quot; (&quot;on the sacred places&quot;), a descriptive work in three books dealing with Jerusalem, Bethlehem, other sites in the Holy Land, and briefly with Alexandria and Constantinople. Many details about Arculf&#x27;s journeys can be inferred from this text.
