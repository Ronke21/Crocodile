<text>John Sherman Rutherford III (born March 12, 1938), also known as &quot;Lone Star JR&quot;, is an American former automobile racing driver. During an Indy Car career that spanned more than three decades, he scored 27 wins and 23 pole positions in 314 starts. He became one of six drivers to win the Indianapolis 500 at least three times, winning in 1974, 1976, and 1980. He also won the CART championship in 1980. 

Rutherford began racing modified stock cars in 1959 and he also dabbled in stock car racing, making 35 NASCAR Cup Series starts from 1963 to 1988. Rutherford won in his first start, at Daytona International Speedway driving for Smokey Yunick. This made him one of the youngest drivers ever to win a NASCAR points-paying race, as well as only the sixth racer in history to win in their NASCAR debut race, a distinction not again achieved until SuperCars racer Shane van Gisbergen won in his NASCAR debut in 2023.

==Racing career==
In 1959, Rutherford started driving modified stock cars in Dallas. He joined the International Motor Contest Association sprint car circuit in 1961 leading it for most of 1962. Rutherford later joined the United States Auto Club (USAC) starting in the Hoosier Hundred and later winning his first championship.

Rutherford won his qualifying heat race for the 1963 Daytona 500, becoming the youngest winner of a Duel as a championship race, a record that would stand as the races were taken off the championship schedule in 1971 (though it has since been broken, the race was not a championship race when it happened). Later that year he also had his first start in the Indianapolis 500. Rutherford&#x27;s first Indy car race win took place at the Atlanta 250. He won the USAC National Sprint Car Championship in 1965.

Rutherford made his first start in the Indianapolis 500 in 1963. The following year he was directly behind Eddie Sachs when Sachs plowed into the burning car of Dave MacDonald, killing both drivers. Rutherford miraculously squeezed between the crash and the wall, passing so close to Sachs&#x27; car that a lemon that Sachs wore on a string around his neck was found inside Rutherford&#x27;s engine compartment.

On April 3, 1966, Rutherford suffered a serious crash at Eldora Speedway. His car flipped out of the track, and he suffered broken arms, a broken finger, and a head injury. He was forced to sit out the 1966 Indy 500 and the rest of the season. He struggled without a competitive ride for the next several seasons. He raised his profile by qualifying a surprising 2nd for the 1970 500. He was back with a top-flight ride when he joined the McLaren team in 1973.
Rutherford won pole position at the Indianapolis 500 in 1973, 1976, and 1980. In 1973, Rutherford set a one-lap track record of 199.071 mph, falling just shy of becoming the first driver to break the 200 mph barrier at Indianapolis. His long-awaited second career win came at the Ontario Motor Speedway in 1973, and victories at the Indianapolis 500 followed in 1974, 1976 and 1980. In 1984, at Michigan International Speedway, Rutherford set an all time Indy car qualifying lap speed record of 215.189 mph. His win in the 1986 Michigan 500 at age 48 made him the oldest winner of a 500-mile race, a record that still stands. From 1973 to 1981 Rutherford recorded nine straight seasons with a victory making him one of just six drivers in Indy Car history to do so.
In October 1977, Rutherford travelled &#x27;down under&#x27; to compete in Australia&#x27;s most famous motor race, the Bathurst 1000 km (600 mi) touring car race at the Mount Panorama Circuit. There, partnering fellow Indianapolis racer Janet Guthrie (who earlier that year had become the first woman to qualify for the Indianapolis 500), Rutherford drove a V8 powered Holden Torana for the team that had won the 1976 race, Ron Hodgson Motors. Driving a completely unfamiliar car (Australian cars have the steering wheel on the right side of the car) on a 6.172 km (3.835 mi) public road course carved into the side of a mountain, Rutherford qualified 26th out of 60 starters. During practice he complained about his car as it was not as good as the teams lead car driven by 1976 winners Bob Morris and John Fitzpatrick (JR was 8.2 seconds slower). Morris then got in the car and while not as quick as his own Torana, easily lapped over 5 seconds faster showing the problem was simply JR&#x27;s lack of familiarity with the car and track. Wisely, JR made a cautious start to the race (another new experience was the standing start), but his race would come effectively to an end on lap 8 when he attempted to lap the Ford Escort RS2000 of 1966 winner Bob Holden. The Torana and Escort made contact and Rutherford ended up crashing into an earth bank at the top of The Mountain. The bent Torana was then brought back to the pits on the back of a tilt-tray truck (with the race still going at full speed and cars passing the truck going along the 2 km long Conrod Straight at over ). It was then disqualified before being reinstated. Rutherford then completed another 5 laps before finally retiring with Guthrie not getting to drive.

Rutherford&#x27;s NASCAR Winston Cup career included 35 starts from 1963 to 1988. He won in his first start, at Daytona International Speedway driving for Smokey Yunick. The win, in the second 100-mile Daytona 500 qualifying race, made him one of the youngest drivers ever to win a full points-paying NASCAR race, as well as the only driver to date to have won in their first start in the Cup Series. (Until 1971, the qualifying races were full points-paying races.) In 1981, Rutherford drove twelve races, the most he ever raced in a single NASCAR season. In addition, Rutherford competed in five runnings of the International Race of Champions – 1975, 1977, 1978, 1980 and 1984.

==Post-racing career==
Rutherford&#x27;s 24th and final start at the Indianapolis 500 would come in 1988. By that time he was running only a part-time schedule, and was splitting time working as a television analyst on NBC, CBS, and ESPN. Starting in 1989, Rutherford also began serving as the driver analyst on the IMS Radio Network, a position he would hold in most years through 2002.

When not racing or working in broadcasting, Rutherford served as the pace car driver for the CART series. He also served as a driver coach, evaluating rookies during rookie orientation and rookie tests. He failed to qualify at Indy in three attempts (1989, 1990, 1992) and was not able to secure a ride in 1991 or 1993. During the month of May 1994, Rutherford officially retired from racing. He was never able to achieve his milestone 25th Indy 500 start.

At the inception of the Indy Racing League in 1996, Rutherford took a full-time position as an official, serving as pace car driver (until 2016) and driver coach. Rutherford also served as a racing consultant for Team Pennzoil, and later, as an ambassador for Arrow McLaren.

== Personal life ==
Although &quot;Lone Star JR&quot; proudly displayed the flag of Texas on his racing helmet, Rutherford was actually born in Coffeyville, Kansas and moved to Texas at a young age.

Johnny met Betty Hoyer, a nurse, at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1963 when he was taking his rookie test. They married two months later and were a highly visible and inseparable couple throughout Johnny&#x27;s racing career. His first Indy 500 win in 1974, with Betty looking on from the pits, helped to end the superstition in American racing against allowing women in the pit area.

Rutherford was the honorary chairman of the Amelia Island Concours d&#x27;Elegance in 2006.

Rutherford was a talented artist during his school, and after the conclusion of his racing career devoted time to renewing his skill. Rutherford&#x27;s art was featured on the program cover of the 2021 Indianapolis 500.

Rutherford, who has been invited to The White House on behalf of Indy on multiple occasions, is considered a popular ambassador and spokesman for the sport of Indy car racing.

<doc id="747786" wikidata="Q1543598" url="?curid=747786" title="Grasslands National Park">
<text>Grasslands National Park is a Canadian national park located near the village of Val Marie, Saskatchewan, and one of 44 national parks and park reserves in Canada&#x27;s national park system (though one of only two in Saskatchewan itself). This national park is north of the U.S. state of Montana and lies adjacent to the international boundary. It consists of two separate parcels, the East Block and West Block.

The park was established in 1981. Prior to this the province&#x27;s only national park was Prince Albert National Park. Grasslands annually receives about 12,000 visitors.

Grasslands National Park represents the Prairie Grasslands natural region, protecting one of the nation&#x27;s few remaining areas of undisturbed dry mixed-grass/shortgrass prairie grassland. The park is located in the World Wildlife Fund-defined Northern short grasslands ecoregion, which spans much of southern Saskatchewan, southern Alberta, and the northern Great Plains states in the US. The unique landscape and harsh, semi-arid climate provide niches for several adapted plants and animals. The park and surrounding area house the country&#x27;s only black-tailed prairie dog colonies. Fauna found in the park include bison, pronghorns, greater sage-grouses, ring-necked pheasants, burrowing owls, coyotes, ferruginous hawks, swift foxes, prairie rattlesnakes, black-footed ferrets, eastern yellow-bellied racers, and greater short-horned lizards. Flora includes blue grama grass, needlegrass, plains cottonwood and silver sagebrush.

== History ==
Erosion by glacial meltwater formed many of the park&#x27;s characteristic features. Highlights of the park&#x27;s geological landscape include the Frenchman River Valley, the Seventy Mile Butte, and the badlands of Rock Creek.

In 1874, Sir George Mercer Dawson discovered Western Canada&#x27;s first dinosaur remains in the Killdeer Badlands during the International Boundary Survey. Later, in 1877, Sitting Bull took refuge in the area with around 5,000 Sioux after the defeat of General Custer at the Battle of Little Bighorn.

Grasslands National Park is on the traditional territory of the Blackfoot (Niitsítapi) people of the Canadian and American plains and is Treaty 4 land. A 2022 agreement between the Métis Nation - Saskatchewan and Parks Canada provides for the transfer of 24 bison.

== West and East Blocks ==

The West Block of the park is located one hour south of Swift Current, and the main visitor reception centre is located in the town of Val Marie. Highlights of the West Block include the Frenchman River Valley, a herd of over 300 plains bison as well as prairie dog colonies. A wide stretch of land on either side of the Frenchman River is an Important Bird Area of Canada called &quot;Grasslands National Park (west) (SK 024)&quot;. Frenchman Valley Campground offers visitors serviced camping sites, teepee camping, and a cook shelter. Backcountry camping is also available. The West Block is located in Census Division No. 4.

The East Block of the park is located about an hour&#x27;s drive south of Assiniboia on the south side of the Wood Mountain Hills in Census Division No. 3. The interpretive centre is in the McGowan House at the new Rock Creek Campground and the information centre is at the museum in Wood Mountain Regional Park. The East Block is more of a wilderness area but has views of the badlands of Rock Creek, the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, and prairie skies. A one-lane, parkway traverses the Rock Creek Badlands. The East Block contains the &quot;Grasslands National Park (east) (SK 023)&quot; Important Bird Area.
In 2006, plains bison from Elk Island National Park in Alberta were reintroduced to Grasslands. By 2015 the herd had grown from the original 71 animals to over 300. The herd is maintained on a section in the park&#x27;s West Block. On 2 October 2009, in a ceremony at Belza House, the park was declared a dark-sky preserve, and a small population of black-footed ferrets was reintroduced into the prairie dog towns after a 70-year absence. Improved night-lighting practices under the dark-sky agreement ensure that the park remains dark at night, preserving a natural environment for all nocturnal wildlife.

<doc id="747788" wikidata="Q1626713" url="?curid=747788" title="Wiley Rutledge">
<text>Wiley Blount Rutledge Jr. (July 20, 1894 – September 10, 1949) was an American jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1943 to 1949. The ninth and final justice appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, he is best known for his impassioned defenses of civil liberties. Rutledge favored broad interpretations of the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause, and he argued that the Bill of Rights applied in its totality to the states. He participated in several noteworthy cases involving the intersection of individual freedoms and the government&#x27;s wartime powers. Rutledge served on the Court until his death at the age of fifty-five. Legal scholars have generally thought highly of the justice, although the brevity of his tenure has minimized his impact on history.

Born in Cloverport, Kentucky, Rutledge attended several colleges and universities, graduating with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1922. He briefly practiced law in Boulder, Colorado, before accepting a position on the faculty of the University of Colorado Law School. Rutledge also taught law at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, Missouri, of which he became the dean; he later served as dean of the University of Iowa College of Law. As an academic, he vocally opposed Supreme Court decisions striking down parts of the New Deal and argued in favor of President Roosevelt&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to expand the Court. Rutledge&#x27;s support of Roosevelt&#x27;s policies brought him to the President&#x27;s attention: he was considered as a potential Supreme Court nominee and was appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, where he developed a record as a supporter of individual liberties and the New Deal. When Justice James F. Byrnes resigned from the Supreme Court, Roosevelt nominated Rutledge to take his place. The Senate overwhelmingly confirmed Rutledge by voice vote, and he took the oath of office on February 15, 1943.

Rutledge&#x27;s jurisprudence placed a strong emphasis on the protection of civil liberties. In &quot;Everson v. Board of Education&quot; (1947), he authored an influential dissenting opinion in support of the separation of church and state. He sided with Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses seeking to invoke the First Amendment in cases such as &quot;West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette&quot; (1943) and &quot;Murdock v. Pennsylvania&quot; (1943); his majority opinion in &quot;Thomas v. Collins&quot; (1945) endorsed a broad interpretation of the Free Speech Clause. In a famed dissent in the wartime case of &quot;In re Yamashita&quot; (1946), Rutledge voted to void the war crimes conviction of the Japanese general Tomoyuki Yamashita, condemning in ringing terms a trial that, in his view, violated the basic principles of justice and fairness enshrined in the Constitution. By contrast, he joined the majority in two cases—&quot;Hirabayashi v. United States&quot; (1943) and &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot; (1944)—that upheld the Roosevelt administration&#x27;s decision to intern tens of thousands of Japanese Americans during World War II. In other cases, Rutledge fervently supported broad due process rights in criminal cases, and he opposed discrimination against women, racial minorities, and the poor.

Rutledge was among the most liberal justices ever to serve on the Supreme Court. He favored a flexible and pragmatic approach to the law that prioritized the rights of individuals. On the Court, his views aligned most often with those of Justice Frank Murphy. Rutledge died in 1949, having suffered a massive stroke, after six years&#x27; service on the Supreme Court. President Harry S. Truman appointed the considerably more conservative Sherman Minton to replace him. Although Rutledge frequently found himself in dissent during his lifetime, many of his views received greater acceptance during the era of the Warren Court.

== Early life and education ==
Wiley Blount Rutledge Jr. was born just outside of Cloverport, Kentucky, on July 20, 1894, to Mary Lou ( Wigginton) and Wiley Blount Rutledge. Wiley Sr., a native of western Tennessee, was a fundamentalist Baptist clergyman who believed firmly in the literal inerrancy of the Bible. He attended seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, and then moved with his wife to pastor a church in Cloverport. After Wiley Jr.&#x27;s birth, his mother contracted tuberculosis; the family left Kentucky in search of a healthier climate. They moved first to Texas and Louisiana and then to Asheville, North Carolina, where the elder Rutledge took up a pastorate. After his wife&#x27;s death in 1903, Wiley Sr. relocated his family throughout Tennessee and Kentucky, where he held temporary pastorates before eventually accepting a permanent post in Maryville, Tennessee.

In 1910, the sixteen-year-old Wiley Jr. enrolled at Maryville College. He studied Latin and Greek, successfully maintaining high grades throughout. One of his Greek instructors was Annabel Person, whom he later married. At Maryville, Rutledge participated vigorously in debate; he argued in support of Woodrow Wilson and against the progressivism of Theodore Roosevelt. He also played football, developed a reputation as a practical jokester, and began a romantic relationship with Person, who was five years his senior. For reasons that are not altogether clear, Rutledge—who had planned to study law upon his graduation and whose lowest grades were in the sciences—left Maryville, enrolled at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and decided to study chemistry. Lonely and struggling in his classwork, Rutledge had a difficult time in Wisconsin, and he later characterized it as being one of the &quot;hardest&quot; and most &quot;painful&quot; periods of his life. He graduated in 1914 with an A. B. degree.

Realizing that his talents did not lie in chemistry, Rutledge resumed his original plan to study law. Since he was unable to afford the University of Wisconsin Law School, he moved to Bloomington, Indiana, where he taught high school and enrolled part-time at the Indiana University Law School. The difficulty of simultaneously working and studying put a serious strain on his health, and, by 1915, he had developed a life-threatening case of tuberculosis. The ailing Rutledge removed himself to a sanatorium and gradually began to recover from his disease; while there, he married Person. Upon recovering, he moved with his wife to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he took a position teaching high school business classes. In 1920, Rutledge enrolled at the University of Colorado Law School in Boulder; he continued teaching high school as he again pursued the study of law. One of his professors was Herbert S. Hadley, the former governor of Missouri. Rutledge later stated that he &quot;owe[d] more professionally to Governor Hadley than to any other person&quot;; Hadley&#x27;s support for Roscoe Pound&#x27;s progressive theory of sociological jurisprudence influenced Rutledge&#x27;s view of the law. Rutledge graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1922.

==Career==

Rutledge passed the bar examination in June 1922 and took a job with the law firm of Goss, Kimbrough, and Hutchison in Boulder. In 1924, he accepted the position of associate professor of law at his alma mater, the University of Colorado. He taught a wide variety of classes, and his colleagues commented that he was experiencing &quot;very considerable success&quot;. In 1926, Hadley—who had recently become chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis—offered Rutledge a full professorship at his university&#x27;s law school; Rutledge accepted the offer and moved to St. Louis with his family that year. He spent nine years there, continuing to teach classes pertaining to many aspects of the law. From 1930 to 1935, Rutledge served as dean of the law school; he then spent four years as dean of the University of Iowa College of Law.

During his time in academia, Rutledge did not function primarily as a scholar: for instance, he only published two articles in law reviews. Yet his students and colleagues thought highly of him as a teacher, and the legal scholar William Wiecek noted that he was recalled as &quot;dedicated and demanding&quot; by those whom he taught. Rutledge frequently weighed in on questions of public importance, supporting academic freedom and free speech at Washington University and opposing the Supreme Court&#x27;s approach to child labor laws. His tenure as dean overlapped with the New Deal-period clash between President Franklin D. Roosevelt and a Supreme Court whose decisions thwarted his agenda. Rutledge came down firmly on Roosevelt&#x27;s side: he denounced the Court&#x27;s rulings striking down portions of the New Deal and voiced support for the President&#x27;s unsuccessful &quot;court-packing plan&quot;, which attempted to make the Court more amenable to Roosevelt&#x27;s agenda by increasing the number of justices. In Rutledge&#x27;s view, the justices of his era had &quot;imposed their own political philosophy&quot; rather than the law in their decisions; as such, he felt that expanding the Court was a regrettable but necessary way for Congress to bring it back into line. Roosevelt&#x27;s proposal was extremely unpopular in the Midwest, and Rutledge&#x27;s support for it was loudly denounced: his position even led some members of the Iowa legislature to threaten to freeze faculty salaries. Still, Roosevelt noticed Rutledge&#x27;s outspoken support for him, and it garnered the dean prominence on the national stage. In the words of Rutledge himself, &quot;[t]he Court bill gave me my chance&quot;.

== Court of Appeals (1939–1943) ==

Having attracted the attention of Roosevelt, Rutledge was seriously considered as a potential Supreme Court nominee when a vacancy arose in 1939. Although the President ultimately appointed Felix Frankfurter to that seat, he decided that it would be politically advantageous to appoint someone from west of the Mississippi—such as Rutledge—to fill the next opening. Roosevelt selected William O. Douglas, who had lived in the states of Minnesota and Washington, instead of Rutledge when that vacancy arose, but he simultaneously offered Rutledge a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia—one of the nation&#x27;s most influential appellate courts—which he accepted. Rutledge appeared before a Senate subcommittee; its members promptly endorsed the nomination. The full Senate speedily confirmed him by voice vote on April 4, 1939, and he took the oath of office on May 2.

At the time, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia heard a unique variety of matters: appeals from the federal district court in Washington, petitions to review the decisions of administrative agencies, and cases (similar to those decided by state supreme courts) arising from the District&#x27;s local court system. As a judge of that court, therefore, Rutledge had the opportunity to write opinions on a wide variety of topics. In Wiecek&#x27;s words, his 118 opinions &quot;reflected his sympathetic views toward organized labor, the New Deal, and noneconomic individual rights&quot;. In &quot;Busey v. District of Columbia&quot;, for instance, he dissented when the majority upheld several Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; convictions for distributing religious literature without securing a license and paying a tax. Writing that &quot;[t]axed speech is not free speech&quot;, Rutledge argued that the government could not charge those who wished to communicate on the streets. His opinion for the court in &quot;Wood v. United States&quot; reversed a conviction for robbery that had been secured after the defendant pleaded guilty at a preliminary hearing without having been informed of his right against self-incrimination. Rutledge wrote that the preliminary hearing was not supposed to be &quot;a trap for luring the unwary into confession or admission which is fatal or prejudicial&quot;; he held that a plea was not voluntary if the defendant was not aware of his constitutional rights. Rutledge&#x27;s jurisprudence emphasized the spirit of the law over the letter of the law; he rejected the use of technicalities to penalize individuals or to circumvent a law&#x27;s underlying purpose. During his time on the Court of Appeals, he never rendered a single decision adverse to organized labor, and his rulings tended to be favorable toward administrative agencies and the New Deal more generally.

== Supreme Court nomination ==

In October 1942, Justice James F. Byrnes resigned from the Supreme Court, creating the ninth and final vacancy of Roosevelt&#x27;s presidency. As a result of Roosevelt&#x27;s many previous appointments to the Court, there was &quot;no obvious successor, no obvious political debt to be paid&quot;, according to the scholar Henry J. Abraham. Some prominent figures, including Justices Felix Frankfurter and Harlan F. Stone, encouraged Roosevelt to appoint the distinguished jurist Learned Hand. However, the President was uncomfortable appointing the seventy-one-year-old Hand due to his age, as Roosevelt feared the appearance of hypocrisy due to the fact that he had cited the advanced age of Supreme Court justices to justify his plan to expand the Court. Attorney General Francis Biddle, who had disclaimed any interest in serving on the court himself, was asked by Roosevelt to search for a suitable nominee. A number of candidates were considered, including federal judge John J. Parker, Solicitor General Charles Fahy, U.S. Senator Alben W. Barkley, and Dean Acheson. But the journalist Drew Pearson soon named another possibility, whom he identified as &quot;the candidate of Chief Justice Stone&quot; in his columns and radio broadcasts: Wiley Rutledge.

Rutledge had no desire to be nominated to the Supreme Court, but his friends nonetheless wrote to Roosevelt and Biddle on his behalf. He wrote to Biddle disclaiming all interest in the position, and he admonished his friends with the words: &quot;For God&#x27;s sake, don&#x27;t do anything about stirring up the matter! I am uncomfortable enough as it is.&quot; Still, Rutledge&#x27;s supporters, most notably the well-regarded journalist Irving Brant, continued to lobby the White House to nominate him, and he stated in private that he would not decline the nomination if Roosevelt offered it to him. Biddle directed his assistant Herbert Wechsler to review Rutledge&#x27;s record; Wechsler&#x27;s report convinced Biddle that Rutledge&#x27;s judicial opinions were &quot;a bit pedestrian&quot; but nonetheless &quot;sound&quot;. Biddle, joined by Roosevelt loyalists such as Douglas, Senator George W. Norris, and Justice Frank Murphy, thus recommended to the President that Rutledge be appointed. After meeting with Rutledge at the White House and being convinced by Biddle that the judge&#x27;s judicial philosophy was fully aligned with his own, Roosevelt agreed. According to the scholar Fred L. Israel, Roosevelt found Rutledge to be &quot;a liberal New Dealer who combined the President&#x27;s respect for the academic community with four years of service on a leading federal appellate court&quot;. Additionally, the fact that Rutledge was a Westerner weighed in his favor. The President told his nominee: &quot;Wiley, we had a number of candidates for the Court who were highly qualified, but they didn&#x27;t have geography—you have that&quot;.

Roosevelt formally nominated Rutledge, who was then forty-eight years old, to the Supreme Court on January 11, 1943. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted on February 1 to approve Rutledge&#x27;s nomination; the vote was 11–0, with four abstentions. Those four senators—North Dakota&#x27;s William Langer, West Virginia&#x27;s Chapman Revercomb, Montana&#x27;s Burton K. Wheeler, and Michigan&#x27;s Homer S. Ferguson—abstained due to uneasiness about Rutledge&#x27;s support for Roosevelt&#x27;s court-expansion plan. Ferguson later spoke with Rutledge and indicated that his concerns had been resolved, but Wheeler, who had strongly opposed Roosevelt&#x27;s efforts to enlarge the Court, said that he would vote against the nomination when it came before the full Senate. The only senator to speak on the Senate floor in opposition to Rutledge was Langer, who characterized Rutledge as &quot;a man who, so far as I can ascertain, never practiced law inside a courtroom or, so far as I know, seldom even visited one until he came to take a seat on the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia&quot; and commented that &quot;[t]he Court is not without a professor or two already.&quot; The Senate overwhelmingly confirmed Rutledge by a voice vote on February 8, and he took the oath of office on February 15.

== Supreme Court (1943–1949) ==

Rutledge served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court from 1943 until his death in 1949. He penned a total of sixty-five majority opinions, forty-five concurrences, and sixty-one dissents. The deeply fractured Court to which he was appointed consisted of a conservative bloc—Justices Frankfurter, Robert H. Jackson, Stanley Forman Reed, and Owen Roberts—and a liberal bloc consisting of Justices Hugo Black, Murphy, Douglas, Rutledge, and sometimes Stone. On a Court plagued by internecine squabbles, Rutledge was, according to the legal historian Lucas A. Powe Jr., &quot;the sole member both personally liked and intellectually respected by every other member&quot;. He found it challenging to write opinions, and his writing style has been criticized as unnecessarily prolix and difficult to read. Rutledge frequently and strenuously dissented—the scholar Alfred O. Canon wrote that he was &quot;in many respects... the chief dissenter of the Roosevelt Court&quot;.

Rutledge was one of the most liberal justices in the history of the Court. His approach to the law strongly emphasized the preservation of civil liberties, motivated by a fervent belief that the freedoms of individuals should be protected. Rutledge voted more often than any of his colleagues in favor of individuals who brought suit against the government, and he forcefully advocated for equal protection, access to the courts, due process, and the rights protected by the First Amendment.According to the legal scholar Lester E. Mosher, Rutledge &quot;may be classed as a &#x27;natural law realist&#x27; who combined the humanitarianism of Thomas Jefferson with the pragmatism of John Dewey—he employed the tenets of pragmatism as a juristic tool or technique in applying &#x27;natural law&#x27; concepts&quot;. His views particularly overlapped with those of Murphy, with whom he agreed in nearly seventy-five percent of the Court&#x27;s non-unanimous cases. The Supreme Court at large did not often embrace Rutledge&#x27;s views during his lifetime, but during the era of the Warren Court they gained considerable acceptance.

=== First Amendment ===
Rutledge&#x27;s appointment had an immediate effect on a Court that was decidedly split on questions involving the freedoms protected by the First Amendment. For instance, in &quot;Jones v. City of Opelika&quot;, a 1942 case decided before Rutledge&#x27;s ascension to the Court, a 5–4 majority had upheld the convictions of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses for selling religious literature without obtaining a license and paying a tax. Rutledge&#x27;s arrival the subsequent year gave that case&#x27;s erstwhile dissenters a majority; in &quot;Murdock v. Pennsylvania&quot;, they overruled &quot;Jones&quot; and struck down the tax as unconstitutional. Rutledge also joined the majority in another precedent-altering case involving Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and the First Amendment: &quot;West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette&quot;. In that landmark decision, the Court reversed its previous holding in &quot;Minersville School District v. Gobitis&quot;, ruling instead that the First Amendment forbade public schools from requiring students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. Writing for a 6–3 majority that included Rutledge, Justice Jackson wrote that: &quot;[i]f there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein&quot;. According to the jurist and scholar John M. Ferren, Rutledge, by his vote in &quot;Barnette&quot;, &quot;established himself early as a concerned protector of religious freedom&quot;.

Among Rutledge&#x27;s most influential free-speech opinions was in the 1945 case of &quot;Thomas v. Collins&quot;. Writing for a 5–4 majority, he ruled unconstitutional a Texas statute that required union organizers to register and obtain a license before they could solicit individuals to join labor unions. The case arose when R. J. Thomas, an official of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, gave a pro-union address in Texas without having registered; he argued that the law was an unconstitutional prior restraint on his First Amendment rights. Rutledge rejected Texas&#x27;s arguments that the law was subject only to rational-basis review because labor organizing was akin to the sort of ordinary business activity that states could freely regulate. Writing that &quot;the indispensable democratic freedoms secured by the First Amendment&quot; had a &quot;preferred place&quot; that could be abridged only in light of a &quot;clear and present danger&quot;, he held that the law imposed an unjustified burden on Thomas&#x27;s constitutional rights. In dissent, Justice Roberts argued that it was not constitutionally problematic to impose a neutral licensing requirement on organizers of public meetings. According to Ferren, Rutledge&#x27;s &quot;celebrated and controversial&quot; opinion in &quot;Thomas&quot; exemplifies both the Court&#x27;s pervasive 5–4 division on First Amendment issues throughout the 1940s and Rutledge&#x27;s &quot;nearly absolutist&quot; interpretation of the Free Speech Clause.

In the case of &quot;Everson v. Board of Education&quot;, Rutledge rendered a noteworthy dissent in defense of the separation of church and state. &quot;Everson&quot; was among the first decisions to interpret the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which forbids the enactment of laws &quot;respecting an establishment of religion&quot;. Writing for the majority, Justice Black concluded that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporated the Establishment Clause, meaning that it applied to the states as well as to the federal government. Quoting Thomas Jefferson, he argued that &quot;the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect &#x27;a wall of separation between Church and State. But despite what Wiecek called a &quot;fusillade of sweeping dicta&quot;, Black nonetheless held for a 5–4 majority that the specific law at issue—a New Jersey statute that permitted parents to be reimbursed for the costs of sending their children to private religious schools by bus—did not violate the Establishment Clause. In dissent, Rutledge favored an even stricter understanding of the Establishment Clause than Black, maintaining that its purpose &quot;was to create a complete and permanent separation of the spheres of religious activity and civil authority by comprehensively forbidding every form of public aid or support for religion&quot;. On that basis, he argued that the New Jersey law was unconstitutional because it provided indirect financial support for religious education. Although Rutledge&#x27;s position in &quot;Everson&quot; was not vindicated by the Court&#x27;s later Establishment Clause jurisprudence, Ferren argued that his dissent &quot;remains as powerful a statement as any Supreme Court justice has written&quot; in support of church–state separation.

In other cases, Rutledge evinced a near-uniform tendency to embrace defenses rooted in the First Amendment: in &quot;Terminiello v. City of Chicago&quot;, he sided with a priest whose rhetorical attacks on Jews and the Roosevelt administration had provoked a riot; in &quot;United Public Workers v. Mitchell&quot; and &quot;Oklahoma v. United States Civil Service Commission&quot;, he dissented when the Court upheld the Hatch Act&#x27;s restrictions on civil servants&#x27; political activity; in &quot;Marsh v. Alabama&quot;, he joined the majority in holding a company town&#x27;s restrictions on the distribution of religious literature unconstitutional. In only a single case—&quot;Prince v. Massachusetts&quot;—did he vote to reject an attempt to invoke the First Amendment. &quot;Prince&quot; involved a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness who had been convicted of violating a Massachusetts child labor law by bringing her nine-year-old niece to distribute religious literature with her. Writing for a 5–4 majority, Rutledge held that Massachusetts&#x27;s interest in protecting children&#x27;s welfare outweighed the child&#x27;s First Amendment rights; he argued that &quot;parents may be free to become martyrs themselves. But it does not follow [that] they are free... to make martyrs of their children.&quot; His usual ally Murphy disagreed, arguing in dissent that the state had not demonstrated &quot;the existence of any grave or immediate danger to any interest which it may lawfully protect&quot;. Rutledge&#x27;s decision to reject the First Amendment argument presented in &quot;Prince&quot; may have stemmed more from his longstanding opposition to child labor than from his views on religious freedom.

=== Criminal procedure ===

In 80 percent of the criminal cases heard by the Supreme Court during his tenure, Rutledge voted in favor of the defendant—substantially more often than the Court as a whole, which did so in only 52 percent of criminal cases. He supported an expansive definition of due process and construed ambiguous statutes in favor of defendants, particularly in cases involving capital punishment. In &quot;Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber&quot;, Rutledge dissented from the Court&#x27;s 5–4 holding that Louisiana could again endeavor to execute a prisoner after the electric chair malfunctioned during the previous attempt. He joined the opinion of Justice Harold H. Burton, who maintained that &quot;death by installments&quot; was a form of cruel and unusual punishment that violated the Due Process Clause. In the case of &quot;In re Oliver&quot;, Rutledge agreed with the majority that a conviction for contempt of court was unlawful because a single judge, sitting as a one-man grand jury, had held proceedings in secret and given the defendant no opportunity to defend himself. Concurring separately, he argued for a broader definition of due process, decrying the Court&#x27;s willingness to permit &quot;selective departure[s]&quot; from the &quot;scheme of ordered personal liberty established by the Bill of Rights&quot; in other cases. Rutledge&#x27;s dissent in &quot;Ahrens v. Clark&quot; demonstrated what Ferren characterized as his &quot;continued impatience... with procedural rules barring access to the federal courts&quot;. The Court in &quot;Ahrens&quot; ruled 6–3 that German nationals seeking writs of habeas corpus to stop their deportations could not lawfully sue in federal court in the District of Columbia. Aided by his law clerk John Paul Stevens, Rutledge dissented, concluding that the court in the District of Columbia had jurisdiction because the person having custody over the prisoners—the Attorney General—was located there. He argued against what he viewed as &quot;a jurisdictional limitation so destructive of the writ&#x27;s availability and adaptability to all the varying conditions and devices by which liberty may be unlawfully restrained&quot;. Stevens later served on the Supreme Court himself; in his majority opinion in &quot;Rasul v. Bush&quot;, he cited Rutledge&#x27;s &quot;Ahrens&quot; dissent to conclude that federal courts had jurisdiction over suits brought by detainees at Guantanamo Bay.

Rutledge maintained that the provisions of the Bill of Rights protected all criminal defendants, regardless of whether they were being tried in state or federal court. He dissented in &quot;Adamson v. California&quot;, in which the Court, by a vote of 5–4, held that the Fifth Amendment&#x27;s protection against forced self-incrimination did not apply to the states. Joining a dissent written by Murphy, he agreed with Justice Black&#x27;s position that the Due Process Clause incorporated the entirety of the Bill of Rights, but he went further than Black to suggest that it also conferred additional due process protections not found elsewhere in the Constitution. In another incorporation dispute, &quot;Wolf v. Colorado&quot;, Rutledge dissented when the Court ruled 6–3 that the exclusionary rule—the prohibition against using illegally seized evidence in court—did not apply to the states. He joined a dissent by Murphy and penned a separate opinion of his own, in which he argued that, without the exclusionary rule, the Fourth Amendment prohibition of unlawful searches and seizures &quot;was a dead letter&quot;. Rutledge&#x27;s dissent was eventually vindicated: in its 1961 decision in &quot;Mapp v. Ohio&quot;, the Court expressly overruled &quot;Wolf&quot;.

=== Wartime cases ===

==== &quot;In re Yamashita&quot; ====

In the 1946 case of &quot;In re Yamashita&quot;, Rutledge rendered an opinion that was later characterized by Ferren as &quot;one of the Court&#x27;s truly great, and influential, dissents&quot;. The case involved the Japanese general Tomoyuki Yamashita, who commanded soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army in the Philippines during World War II. At the end of the war, troops under Yamashita&#x27;s command killed tens of thousands of Filipinos, many of whom were civilians. On the basis that he was responsible for the actions of his troops, Yamashita was charged with war crimes and tried before a military commission. At trial, the prosecution could not demonstrate either that Yamashita was aware of the atrocities committed by his troops or that he had any control over their actions; witnesses testified that they were responsible for the killings and that Yamashita had no knowledge of them. The commission, which consisted of five American generals, nonetheless found him guilty and sentenced him to death by hanging. Yamashita petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that the conviction was unlawful due to a bevy of procedural irregularities, including the admission of hearsay and fabricated evidence, restrictions on the defense&#x27;s ability to cross-examine witnesses, a lack of time for the defense to prepare its case, and a dearth of proof that Yamashita (as opposed to his troops) was guilty. Although the justices desired to stay out of questions of military justice, Rutledge and Murphy, who were gravely worried by what they viewed as serious procedural problems, convinced their colleagues to grant review and hear arguments in the case.

On February 4, 1946, the Court ruled by a 6–2 vote against Yamashita, upholding the result of the trial. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Stone stated that the Court could consider only whether the military commission was validly formed, not whether Yamashita was innocent or guilty. Since the United States had not yet signed a peace treaty with Japan, he maintained that the Articles of War permitted military trials to be conducted without complying with the Constitution&#x27;s due process requirements. Arguing that military tribunals &quot;are not courts whose rulings and judgments are made subject to review by this Court&quot;, he declined to address the other issues presented by the case. The two dissenters—Murphy and Rutledge—each filed separate opinions; according to Yamashita&#x27;s lawyer, they read them &quot;in tones so bitter and in language so sharp that it was readily apparent to all listeners that even more acrimonious expression must have marked the debate behind the scenes&quot;. In a dissent that scholars have characterized as &quot;eloquent&quot;, &quot;moving&quot;, and &quot;magisterial&quot;, Rutledge decried the trial as an egregious violation of the ideals of justice and fairness protected by the Constitution. He denounced the majority opinion as an abdication of the Court&#x27;s responsibility to apply the rule of law to all, even to the military. Rutledge wrote:

Rutledge wrote privately that he felt the case would &quot;outrank &quot;Dred Scott&quot; in the annals of the Court&quot;. In his dissent, he rejected the majority&#x27;s holding that the Fifth Amendment was inapplicable, writing that: &quot;[n]ot heretofore has it been held that any human being is beyond its universally protecting spread in the guaranty of a fair trial in the most fundamental sense. That door is dangerous to open. I will have no part in opening it. For once it is ajar, even for enemy belligerents, it can be pushed back wider for others, perhaps ultimately for all.&quot; Rebutting Stone&#x27;s contentions point by point, Rutledge concluded that the charges against Yamashita were defective, that the evidence against him was inadequate and unlawfully admitted, and that the trial had violated the Articles of War, the 1929 Geneva Convention, and the Fifth Amendment&#x27;s Due Process Clause. In closing, he quoted the words of Thomas Paine: &quot;He that would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression; for if he violates this duty he establishes a precedent that will reach to himself.&quot; Although Rutledge&#x27;s dissent did not prevent Yamashita from being hanged, the legal historian Melvin I. Urofsky has written that its &quot;influence, however, cannot be gainsaid ... The Court has not been involved with any war crimes trials in several decades, but aside from the jurisdictional issue it is clear that the ideas expressed by Wiley Rutledge—in terms of both due process and command accountability—have triumphed.&quot;

==== Japanese internment ====
In an act characterized by Urofsky as &quot;the worst violation of civil liberties in American history&quot;, the Roosevelt administration ordered in 1942 that approximately 110,000 men, women, and children of Japanese ancestry—including about 70,000 native-born American citizens—be detained on the basis that they posed a threat to the war effort. The Supreme Court, with the agreement of Rutledge, conferred its imprimatur on this decision in the cases of &quot;Hirabayashi v. United States&quot; and &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot;. The first of these cases arose when Gordon Hirabayashi, a college student born in the United States, was arrested, convicted, and jailed for refusing to comply with the order to report for relocation. Before the Supreme Court, he argued that the order unlawfully discriminated against Japanese Americans on the basis of race. The Court unanimously rejected his plea: in an opinion by Chief Justice Stone, it refused to question the military&#x27;s assertion that the relocation program was critical to national security. Rutledge wrote privately that he had experienced &quot;more anguish over this case&quot; than almost any other, but he eventually voted to sustain Hirabayashi&#x27;s conviction. In a brief concurrence, he disagreed with Stone&#x27;s argument that courts had no authority whatsoever to review wartime actions of the military but joined the remainder of the majority opinion.

When the &quot;Korematsu&quot; case arrived at the Court the subsequent year, it had become clear to many that the internment program was unjustifiable: not a single Japanese American had been charged with treason or espionage, and the American military had largely neutralized the threat that Japan posed. Yet by a 6–3 vote, the Court rejected Fred Korematsu&#x27;s challenge to the orders, again choosing to defer to the military and to Congress. Writing for the majority, Justice Black authored what Wiecek called &quot;an almost schizophrenic opinion, unpersuasive in its arguments and ambiguous in its ultimate impact&quot;. Justices Roberts, Jackson, and Murphy dissented: Roberts decried the &quot;clear violation of Constitutional rights&quot; implicit in punishing an American citizen &quot;for not submitting to imprisonment in a concentration camp, based on his ancestry, and solely because of his ancestry, without evidence or inquiry concerning his loyalty and good disposition toward the United States&quot;, while Murphy characterized the orders as a &quot;fall ... into the ugly abyss of racism&quot;. Rutledge joined Black&#x27;s opinion immediately and unreservedly, silently taking part in what Ferren called &quot;one of the saddest episodes in the Court&#x27;s history&quot;.

The legal scholar Lester E. Mosher wrote that Rutledge&#x27;s vote in &quot;Korematsu&quot; &quot;represents the only deviation in his record as a champion of civil rights&quot;. Addressing the question of why the justice chose to depart from his customary support for equality and civil liberties in &quot;Yamashita&quot;, the law professor Craig Green observes that Rutledge had great faith in the Roosevelt administration and was hesitant to question its assertions that the internment orders were vital to national security. Green also argues that the modern condemnation of the Court&#x27;s decision benefits substantially from hindsight: after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the threat of sabotage appeared serious, and the government had hidden information that would have raised doubts about the accuracy of its assessments. There is no evidence that Rutledge ever expressed regret for his vote in &quot;Korematsu&quot;, unlike Douglas, who later condemned the decision in his memoirs. Ferren suggests two possibilities: either Rutledge &quot;abandon[ed] principle out of loyalty to his president&quot; or he &quot;act[ed] instead with a kind of courage&quot; by reluctantly reaching an unpalatable conclusion that he felt the Constitution required. In Ferren&#x27;s view, &quot;[t]he irony for Wiley Rutledge, when viewed in hindsight, is that he participated in a ruling of the sort that he would have berated, in other contexts, as another &quot;&#x27;Dred Scott&quot; decision.

=== Equal protection ===

In cases involving equal protection, Rutledge opposed discrimination against women, the poor, and racial minorities. His dissent in &quot;Goesaert v. Cleary&quot;, according to Ferren, constituted &quot;the first modern gender discrimination opinion&quot;. In &quot;Goesaert&quot;, the majority upheld a Michigan law that prevented women from being bartenders unless they were related to a male bar-owner. Writing that the Equal Protection Clause &quot;require[s] lawmakers to refrain from invidious distinctions of the sort drawn by the statute challenged in this case&quot;, Rutledge maintained that Michigan&#x27;s law was arbitrary and irrational. His focus on the law&#x27;s rationality mirrored the strategy pursued by future Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in her efforts as an ACLU attorney to challenge laws that discriminated on the basis of gender. Dissenting in &quot;Foster v. Illinois&quot;, Rutledge voted to reverse the convictions of defendants who had not been informed of their right to counsel. He invoked the Due Process Clause but also maintained that equal protection had been violated, writing that poorer defendants, lacking an understanding of their rights, would receive &quot;only the shadow of constitutional protections&quot;. His &quot;Foster&quot; dissent was among the first opinions in which a Supreme Court justice argued against poverty-based discrimination on equal-protection grounds. In his opinion in &quot;Fisher v. Hurst&quot;, Rutledge expressed concern about discrimination against racial minorities. The Court had previously ordered Oklahoma to allow Ada Lois Sipuel, an African-American woman, to study law. In &quot;Fisher&quot;, the Court rejected Thurgood Marshall&#x27;s mandamus petition to enforce that ruling. Rutledge dissented, arguing that Oklahoma&#x27;s law school should be shut down in its entirety if the state refused to admit Sipuel. With the exception of Murphy, who would have held a hearing on the matter, Rutledge was the only justice to dissent.

Cases involving voting rights were the only ones in which Rutledge rejected attempts to invoke the Equal Protection Clause. In &quot;Colegrove v. Green&quot;, voters challenged an Illinois congressional apportionment scheme that created districts with unequal numbers of people, arguing that it violated federal law and the Constitution. The Court, by a vote of 4–3, rejected that argument; in a plurality opinion, Frankfurter concluded that claims of malapportionment presented political questions that the federal courts lacked the authority to resolve. Rutledge agreed with the dissenters—Black, Douglas, and Murphy—that the dispute did not present a nonjusticiable political question, but he nonetheless voted with the majority. Stating that an insufficient amount of time remained for Illinois to redraw its districts before the election, he concluded in a separate opinion concurring in the judgment that it would be inequitable to strike down the map at that time. In &quot;MacDougall v. Green&quot;, Rutledge similarly voted to defer to the states on questions involving election procedures. Although the Progressive Party had collected the 25,000 signatures required for it to appear on the Illinois ballot, it had not satisfied the requirement to collect 200 signatures from each of 50 counties—a requirement that harmed parties whose voters were concentrated in urban areas. The Court, relying on &quot;Colegrove&quot;, upheld Illinois&#x27;s requirement. Again parting ways with Black, Douglas, and Murphy but refusing to join the majority&#x27;s analysis, Rutledge declined to grant the Progressive Party relief, maintaining that there was not enough time before the election for the state to print new ballots. In both cases, Rutledge&#x27;s vote was based on his concern that any possible remedy for the constitutional problem would be unfair as well.

=== Business, labor, and the Commerce Clause ===
Rutledge&#x27;s dissent in &quot;United States v. United Mine Workers&quot; was perhaps his most noteworthy opinion that did not involve questions of civil liberties. A federal judge had issued a temporary restraining order enjoining John L. Lewis and his union of coal miners—the United Mine Workers—from striking against the federal government, which had seized the coal mines due to labor unrest. The union ignored the order and went on strike; the judge held both Lewis and the union in civil and criminal contempt and levied a $3.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) fine. Before the Supreme Court, the union argued that the injunction against it had violated the Norris–La Guardia Act, which forbade the courts from issuing injunctive relief against striking workers. The Court rejected the union&#x27;s claims, holding that the Norris–La Guardia Act applied only to disputes between employees and employers and that the federal government was not considered an employer under the statute. A splintered majority thus upheld the injunction and the contempt convictions, although the fine was reduced to $700,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). In dissent, Rutledge argued that the temporary restraining order did violate the Norris–La Guardia Act. He also decried the district court&#x27;s decision to hold the union in both civil and criminal contempt, writing that &quot;the idea that a criminal prosecution and a civil suit for damages or equitable relief could be hashed together in a single criminal-civil hodgepodge would be shocking to every American lawyer and to most citizens&quot;. Rutledge&#x27;s dissent was rendered in the midst of substantial hostility among political leaders and the general public toward the union&#x27;s actions, and the scholar Fred L. Israel characterized it as &quot;courageous&quot;.

In cases involving the Constitution&#x27;s Commerce Clause, Rutledge favored a pragmatic approach that endeavored to balance the interests of states and the federal government. Writing for the Court in &quot;Bob-Lo Excursion Co. v. Michigan&quot;, he ruled against a ferry company that had been charged with violating a Michigan civil rights law by refusing to serve African-Americans. The ferry company, noting that its boats sailed from Detroit to Bois Blanc Island in Ontario, Canada, had argued that it was engaged in foreign commerce that was exempt from state regulation under the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine. In a narrow ruling, Rutledge held that, although Michigan was technically regulating foreign commerce, the statute imposed no serious burden on it because the island was for all practical purposes a part of Detroit. The case exemplified his flexible approach to the Commerce Clause. In &quot;Prudential Insurance Co. v. Benjamin&quot;, Rutledge&#x27;s opinion for the Court upheld a South Carolina tax on out-of-state insurers against a Commerce Clause challenge. The McCarran–Ferguson Act, passed by Congress in 1945, had authorized state regulation of the insurance market; Rutledge concluded that the act permissibly allowed South Carolina to discriminate against interstate commerce—something it otherwise lacked the power to do. His conclusion that Congress could consent to state regulations of interstate commerce demonstrated his support for what one scholar called &quot;flexibility in the operations of the federal system&quot;.

==Personal life and death==

Rutledge and his wife Annabel had three children: a son, Neal, and two daughters, Mary Lou and Jean Ann. Raised a Southern Baptist, Rutledge later became a Christian humanist; his religious views resembled those of Unitarianism. He was universally regarded as a pleasant and friendly man who genuinely cared about everyone with whom he interacted.

Rutledge&#x27;s perfectionism and penchant for hard work drove him to the point of exhaustion by the summer of 1949, and his friends and family expressed worry about his health. On August 27, while in Ogunquit, Maine, he experienced a hemorrhagic stroke and was hospitalized in nearby York Harbor. The fifty-five-year-old justice drifted in and out of consciousness and, on September 10, died. President Harry S. Truman, writing to Rutledge&#x27;s wife Annabel, stated that a &quot;tower of strength has been lost to our national life&quot;; Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson praised the justice as &quot;true to his ideals and, in all, a great American&quot;. Rutledge&#x27;s funeral service, conducted by A. Powell Davies, was held at All Souls&#x27; Unitarian Church on September 14. A headstone in Rutledge&#x27;s memory was placed at Mountain View Cemetery in Boulder, Colorado, but the grave is empty: as of 2008, his physical remains are held at Cedar Hill Cemetery in Suitland, Maryland, pending further instructions from his family. Rutledge&#x27;s death was almost simultaneous with that of Murphy; Truman&#x27;s appointments of Sherman Minton and Tom C. Clark, respectively, to replace them led to a considerably more conservative Court.

== Legacy ==
Legal scholars have generally looked favorably upon Rutledge&#x27;s tenure on the Supreme Court, although the brevity of his service has lessened his historical importance. In a 1965 biography, Fowler V. Harper opined that &quot;[h]istory is writing Wiley Rutledge into the slender volume of &#x27;Justices in the Great Tradition. The political scientist A. E. Keir Nash responded in 1994 that &quot;calling him a great justice looks somewhat like calling John Kennedy a great president. It substitutes a wistful &#x27;what might have been&#x27; for a realistic &#x27;what was&#x27;.&quot; A 1970 survey of judges and legal academics ranked Rutledge as the twenty-fourth-greatest justice of the Supreme Court; a similar 1993 assessment found that he had fallen to thirty-fifth place. Observing that &quot;short tenure naturally tends to depress rankings&quot;, the scholar William G. Ross suggested that &quot;bright and able persons&quot; such as Rutledge &quot;would have received higher rankings—perhaps even as &#x27;greats&#x27;—if their tenures had not been cut short&quot;. Timothy L. Hall argued in 2001 that Rutledge&#x27;s judicial career &quot;was like the unfinished first symphony of a composer who might have gone on to create great masterpieces but who died before they could ever flow from his pen... [H]is steady outpouring of opinions over the course of six years yielded only a tantalizing glimpse of what might have been.&quot;

<text>Francisco Javier Ortiz Franco (1954 in Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato – June 22, 2004 in Tijuana, Baja California) was a Mexican journalist, who was murdered after writing about drug trafficking.

==Biography==
Prior to his work as a journalist, Ortiz trained as a lawyer. In 1980, he joined Jesús Blancornelas and Héctor Félix Miranda in founding &quot;Zeta&quot;, a weekly magazine known for its coverage of organized crime, drug trafficking, and government corruption. Ortiz served as an editor and also wrote a column for the magazine on legal issues.

In 2004, Ortiz began to write about drug trafficking. 
At around this time, &quot;Zeta&quot;&#x27;s editor-in-chief Jesús Blancornelas wanted to remove bylines from &quot;Zeta&quot;&#x27;s most dangerous stories, but was persuaded not to by Ortiz, who wished his to continue to run.

==Death==
On June 22, 2004, Ortiz was shot three or four times at the wheel of his car by masked gunmen in a drive-by shooting. The murder took place in full view of his son and daughter (aged 9 and 11), as he left a midday doctor&#x27;s appointment.

Four days later, dozens of journalists marched in protest of the murder. On June 28, rallies against crime occurred in at least 10 Mexican cities, drawing hundreds of thousands of participants.

Blancornelas, who had also lost another &quot;Zeta&quot; co-founder, Héctor Félix Miranda, to murder in 1988, stated, &quot;I feel remorse for having created Zeta. After losing three colleagues, I believe the price has been too high. I would have liked to retire a long time ago ... [but] I cannot allow drug traffickers to think that they were able to crush Zeta&#x27;s spirit, and our readers to believe that we are afraid.&quot;

Zeta published a list of suspects obtained from the Attorney General of Mexico that included the Tijuana Cartel (Arellano-Félix family), Los Zetas, and Jorge Hank Rhon, a businessman whose bodyguards had been convicted for killing Héctor Félix Miranda. Ortiz was Miranda&#x27;s lawyer and he was seeking to reopen the case. 

Federal prosecutors later linked the murder to the Tijuana Cartel, leaving other options open, with Ortiz&#x27;s coverage of the organization as the probable motive. In April 2011, the new editor of &quot;Zeta&quot;, Adela Navarro Bello ran a front-page story stating that the newspaper had learned from cartel enforcer Luis Alberto Salazar Vega that cartel head Javier Arellano Félix had personally ordered the murder after Ortiz had published photographs of the organization&#x27;s members. Still, the investigation reached no conclusion and remains open with no identified suspects or arrests.

<doc id="747799" wikidata="Q1141939" url="?curid=747799" title="Cruel Summer (Bananarama song)">
<text>&quot;Cruel Summer&quot; is a song by English girl group Bananarama. It was written by Bananarama and Steve Jolley, Tony Swain, and produced by Jolley and Swain. Released in 1983, it was initially a stand-alone single but was subsequently included on their self-titled second album a year later. The song reached number eight on the UK Singles Chart in 1983 and the group appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; that summer (July 1983), and after its inclusion in the 1984 film &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;, it reached number nine on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Bananarama singer Sara Dallin said the song &quot;played on the darker side (of summer songs): it looked at the oppressive heat, the misery of wanting to be with someone as the summer ticked by. We&#x27;ve all been there!&quot; It was ranked number 44 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Songs of the &#x27;80s. &quot;Billboard&quot; named the song number 13 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Cruel Summer&quot; was an immediate success when it was released in the UK, reaching number eight on the UK Singles Chart, and the group performed the song live on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in July 1983. Its international popularity soared after its inclusion in the 1984 feature film &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;; this was a year after the song&#x27;s original release (the song was released in 1984 in the US). The group did not allow the song to be included on the film&#x27;s soundtrack album, but it still reached number nine in the US, their first top-10 hit there. When Bananarama were still struggling to make money in their early years, they even performed the song at a beauty contest in Hawaii. The song&#x27;s biggest chart success was in South Africa, where it peaked at number three.

The song has since been revived in various forms. It has appeared in several television commercials, and was covered by other acts, such as Ace of Base, who had an international hit with it (their version reached gold in the US). Blestenation sampled and remixed the song to make their own, also named &quot;Cruel Summer&quot; but with interspersed rap lyrics and altered structure; there are two edits of this song, one of which appeared on the 2002 &quot;Blue Crush&quot; soundtrack.

Since the original release of the song, Bananarama recorded another three versions. &quot;Cruel Summer &#x27;89&quot; was released in 1989, and given a new jack swing makeover, featuring Dallin and Woodward&#x27;s vocals as a duo for the first time. It reached number 19 on the UK Singles Chart in June. This version was not included on any Bananarama album until 2005&#x27;s &quot;Really Saying Something: The Platinum Collection&quot;. Another version of the song was recorded and featured on their 2001 album &quot;Exotica&quot;. This version featured Latin instrumentation and additional lyrics, but it was not released as a single. They released another updated version in 2009, as a B-side of their single &quot;Love Comes&quot;. In 2023, Bananarama released a new version to celebrate the song&#x27;s 40th anniversary called &quot;Cruel Summer 3AM&quot;.

==Music video==
The music video was directed by Brian Simmons, and shot primarily in the Dumbo section of New York City&#x27;s Brooklyn borough in mid-1983. It opens with a shot of Manhattan in the background, including the decade-old World Trade Center.

&quot;[It] was just an excuse to get us to the fabled city of New York for the first time,&quot; Siobhan Fahey has said. She recalled the shoot, conducted during a heatwave, as a difficult experience. &quot;It was August, over one hundred degrees (38 °C). Our HQ was a tavern under the Brooklyn Bridge, which had a ladies&#x27; room with a chipped mirror where we had to do our makeup.&quot;

After an exhausting morning shooting in the city in brutal August heat, the band returned to the tavern for lunch. They made the acquaintance of some local dockworkers, who, upon learning of their situation, shared vials of cocaine with them. &quot;That was our lunch,&quot; said Fahey, who had never tried the drug before. &quot;When you watch that video, we look really tired and miserable in the scenes we shot before lunch, and then the after-lunch shots are all euphoric and manic.&quot;

The music video for the 1989 remix was a compilation of different shots from Bananarama&#x27;s earlier videoclips. Notably missing are clips from the original 1983 video. Fahey is only featured in a pair of frames. Bananarama were unable to record a proper video for the song, because they were in the middle of a world tour at the time of its release.

In the video, Bananarama members are depicted as working at a Texaco gas station and are picked up by a man driving a Mack truck.

==Ace of Base version==

In 1998, Swedish pop group Ace of Base recorded the song at the request of their German and American record labels PolyGram and Arista Records. It was released as the second single from their third album, &quot;Flowers&quot; (1998), and as the lead single from the American version of the album titled &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;. A different &quot;dancier&quot; version of the song (known as the Big Bonus mix on the album), produced by Stephen Hague, Jonas &quot;Joker&quot; Berggren, Ulf &quot;Buddha&quot; Ekberg, and Johnny Jam &amp; Delgado, was released on mainland Europe. The original album version, produced by Cutfather &amp; Joe, was released in North America and UK.

&quot;Cruel Summer&quot; reached number 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was certified gold. In the United Kingdom, the song reached number eight on the UK Singles Chart, matching the peak of the original Bananarama version. It also became Ace of Base&#x27;s 4th and final Top 10 single in the US.

===Critical reception===
Quentin Harrison of Albumism described the song as an &quot;engaging cover&quot; in his retrospective review of &quot;Flowers&quot;, and added that &quot;one variant is closer to the originating take, albeit with a spike of hip-hop flavor for a bit of modish spunk&quot;, while &quot;the second rendition is a surprisingly danceable, Spanish flecked trip.&quot; AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine said it is &quot;the melodic high point&quot; of the &quot;Cruel Summer&quot; album. Larry Flick from &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote that &quot;the act that gave the such ABBA-esque ditties as &quot;All That She Wants&quot; and &quot;The Sign&quot; turns its attention toward Bananarama, faithfully covering one of that group&#x27;s bigger &#x27;80s-era hits. Producers Cutfather &amp; Joe bring a few new rhythm ideas to the table dropping the tempo to a jeep-inspired funk beat and injecting an ear-tickling keyboard twist or two. However, the vocals hold few surprises, which is exactly what fans of both Ace Of Base and the original recording will want. In all, a potential smash that could keep this Swedish quartet on the front burner of top 40 radio for much of the summer.&quot; Kelly Pickerel from &quot;Daily Kent Stater&quot; said she liked this remake better than Bananarama&#x27;s original, noting that &quot;it’s also one of those songs you can never get out of your head as soon as you hear it&quot;.

Chuck Campbell from &quot;The Daily News&quot; noted it as a &quot;slick-but-faithful remake&quot;. A reviewer from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commented that &quot;it&#x27;s clear what Ace of Base Svengali Jonas Berggren is aiming for — the iridescent sonic symmetry of Swedish forebears ABBA. A pretty lofty ambition. But he and his seraphic singing sisters, Linn and Jenny, actually attain ABBA&#x27;s perfect pop-Euro-disco balance on this third outing. There isn&#x27;t a note out of concordant place, no potential hook overlooked. Excepting the pointless title track, Berggren has done his homework. Just don&#x27;t hate him because they sound so pretty.&quot; &quot;Evening Herald&quot; said it is a gem, adding &quot;more of the same can often be a good thing&quot;. Swedish newspaper &quot;Expressen&quot; stated that the song &quot;shows why Ace of Base once ruled the pop world&quot;. Gary Shipes from &quot;The Stuart News&quot; wrote in his review, that &quot;the bubble-gum juvenilia of the original is replaced with updated hardware and a contemporary dance arrangement that launches the arc the rest of the CD will follow. At once melancoholic and jovial, the band&#x27;s driving rhythmic force leaves no option but to fill dance floors on a dime.&quot;

===Chart performance===
&quot;Cruel Summer&quot; was successful on the charts in Europe, Canada and the US. In Europe, it made it to the top 10 in Hungary, on MTV&#x27;s European Top 20 and in the United Kingdom. In the latter, the single peaked at number eight in its first week at the UK Singles Chart, on 4 October 1998. Additionally, it climbed into the top 20 in Scotland, as well as on the Eurochart Hot 100, where &quot;Cruel Summer&quot; reached its highest position as number 16. It was a top 30 hit in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Iceland and Switzerland. Outside Europe, it peaked at number two on the &quot;RPM&quot; Dance/Urban chart and number six on the &quot;RPM&quot; Top Singles chart in Canada, number 10 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart in the United States. It earned a gold record in the US, with a sale of 500,000 singles.

===Music video===
A music video was filmed and directed by English director Nigel Dick. It was shot in Rome, Italy between 27 and 29 June 1998.
There are three versions of the video:
* &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;
* &quot;Cruel Summer&quot; (Big Bonus Mix)
* &quot;Cruel Summer&quot; (Frenglish version featuring Alliage)

The original video and the video using the Big Bonus Mix contain identical and similar footage, whereas the Frenglish version contains completely new footage. The Big Bonus Mix video was uploaded to YouTube in January 2015. As of August 2022, it had more than 17 million views on Youtube .

<text>James Hugh Ryan (December 15, 1886 – November 23, 1947) was an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as rector of the Catholic University of America (1928–1935) and as bishop and later archbishop of the Archdiocese of Omaha (1935–1947).

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
James Ryan was born on December 15, 1886, in Indianapolis, Indiana, to John Marshall and Brigid (née Rogers) Ryan. John Ryan worked as superintendent of motor power of the Lake Erie and Western Railroad. James Ryan attended Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Mount St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary of the West in Cincinnati, Ohio. He then went to Rome, where he earned Bachelor of Sacred Theology (1906) and Doctor of Sacred Theology degrees (1909) from the Urban College of Propaganda and a Ph.D. from the Roman Academy (1908). 

=== Priesthood ===
Ryan was ordained to the priesthood in Rome on June 5, 1909. Following his return to Indiana, he was appointed chaplain of the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods in Indiana and professor of psychology at St. Mary-of-the-Woods College in Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana, from 1911 to 1921.

Ryan then began his career at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he served as instructor in philosophy (1922–26) and associate professor of philosophy (1926–28). In July 1928 he was named the fifth rector of the university. During his administration, he reorganized and rebuilt the university, also instituting nursing courses and a School of Social Work and expanding the graduate school to admit 800 students. 

Ryan became a well-known and powerful figure in Washington. He was once received by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and his send-off party was attended by the likes of Ambassador Hans Luther, Assistant Attorney General Joseph B. Keenan, Justice Pierce Butler, Postmaster General James Farley, Secretary Henry A. Wallace, and Canon Anson Phelps Stokes. Ryan served as the first executive secretary of the National Catholic Welfare Council (1920–28), and was raised to the rank of domestic prelate in 1927 and of protonotary apostolic in 1929.

=== Titular Bishop of Modra ===
On August 15, 1933, Ryan was appointed titular bishop of Modra by Pope Pius XI, in acknowledgment of his accomplishments as rector. He received his episcopal consecration on October 25, 1933, from Bishop Joseph Chartrand, with Bishops Thomas Edmund Molloy and Joseph Ritter serving as co-consecrators, at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C. 

=== Bishop and Archbishop of Omaha ===
Following the appointment of Bishop Joseph Rummel to Archbishop of New Orleans in March 1935, Ryan was named the fifth bishop of the Diocese of Omaha on August 3, 1935. In 1939, he was sent to South America to &quot;develop cultural relationships&quot; on behalf of the American Catholic Church and the U.S. Department of State. Following his return, he declared, &quot;The foundation has been laid for a &#x27;Catholic front&#x27; to protect democracy in this hemisphere.&quot;

When the Diocese of Omaha was elevated to the rank of an archdiocese, Ryan became its first Archbishop on August 4, 1945. He died two years later from a heart attack at age 60.

<text>The Intuitionist is a 1999 speculative fiction novel by American writer Colson Whitehead.

&quot;The Intuitionist&quot; takes place in a city (implicitly, New York) full of skyscrapers and other buildings requiring vertical transportation in the form of elevators. The time, never identified explicitly, is one when black people are called &quot;colored&quot; and integration is a current topic. The protagonist is Lila Mae Watson, an elevator inspector of the &quot;Intuitionist&quot; school. The Intuitionists practice an inspecting method by which they ride in an elevator and intuit the state of the elevator and its related systems. The competing school, the &quot;Empiricists&quot;, insists upon traditional instrument-based verification of the condition of the elevator. Watson is the second black inspector and the first black female inspector in the city.

==Plot summary==

The story begins with the catastrophic failure of an elevator which Watson had inspected just days before, leading to suspicion cast upon both herself and the Intuitionist school as a whole. To cope with the inspectorate, the corporate elevator establishment, and other looming elements, she must return to her intellectual roots, the texts (both known and lost) of the founder of the school, to try to reconstruct what is happening around her.

In the course of her search, she discovers the central idea of the founder of Intuitionism – that of the &quot;black box&quot;, the perfect elevator, which will deliver the people to the city of the future.

==Characters==
* Lila Mae Watson: Protagonist
* James Fulton: Founder of Intuitionism (dead before the story starts)
* Raymond Coombs: Spy for a big elevator company (disguised as &quot;Natchez&quot;, a poor nephew of Fulton&#x27;s interested in the black box and in Lila Mae)
* Marie Claire Rogers: Fulton&#x27;s servant and heir
* Ben Urich: Reporter who has written a story on the black box for &quot;Lift&quot; magazine
* Jim Corrigan and John Murphy: Thugs
* Frank Chancre: President of the Elevator Guild, Empiricist
* Orville Lever: Liberal and Intuitionist candidate for the presidency of the Elevator Guild
* Mr. Reed: Lever&#x27;s secretary and campaign manager
* Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Gould: Mere escalator inspector, on good terms with Lila Mae
* Pompey: Black elevator inspector, Empiricist

== Critical reception ==
On Book Marks, from nine critics: four &quot;rave&quot; and five &quot;positive&quot;.

A &quot;Newsweek&quot; review wrote, &quot;255 pages of the most engaging literary sleuthing you&#x27;ll read this year,&quot; and &quot;What makes the novel so extraordinary is the ways in which Whitehead plays with notions of race.&quot; Walter Kirn, writing in &quot;Time&quot;, called it &quot;The freshest racial allegory since Ralph Ellison&#x27;s &quot;Invisible Man&quot; and Toni Morrison&#x27;s &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot;.&quot;

Gary Krist, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said it was an &quot;ingenious and starkly original first novel.&quot;

A review in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; compared it to &quot;Catch-22&quot;, and Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s &quot;V.&quot; and &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;.

== Honors ==

* Quality Paperback Book Club New Voices Award
* Finalist, PEN/Hemingway Award

<text>General John Dale Ryan (December 10, 1915 – October 27, 1983) was the seventh Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force. As chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force, General Ryan served in a dual capacity. He was a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which, as a body, acts as the principal military advisers to the president, the National Security Council, and the Secretary of Defense. In his other capacity, he was responsible to the Secretary of the Air Force for managing the vast human and materiel resources of the world&#x27;s most powerful aerospace force.

In May 1972, Ryan was the subject of one of President Richard Nixon&#x27;s more severe rants.

==Early life==
John Dale Ryan was born in Cherokee, Iowa, on December 10, 1915. Following graduation from Cherokee Junior College in 1934, he entered the United States Military Academy, played varsity football, and graduated in 1938. He next attended pilot training in Texas at Randolph and Kelly fields, and received his pilot wings in 1939.

==Military career==

Ryan remained at Kelly Field as a flight instructor for approximately two years. From January 1942 until August 1943, he was director of training at Midland Army Airfield, Texas, and was instrumental in establishing an advanced bombardier training school. His next assignment was as operations officer for the Second Air Force at Colorado Springs, Colorado. In February 1944, he was transferred to Italy, where he commanded the 2d Bombardment Group and later became operations officer for the 5th Bombardment Wing, Fifteenth Air Force. While commanding the 2d Bombardment Group he lost a finger to enemy anti-aircraft fire. Later on, this resulted in his nickname, sometimes used derisively, &quot;Three-fingered Jack.&quot;

Ryan returned to Texas in April 1945, and became deputy air base commander at Midland Army Airfield. In September, he was assigned to the Air Training Command at Fort Worth and Randolph Field, where he remained until April 1946, when he assumed duties with the 58th Bombardment Wing and participated in the Bikini Atoll atomic weapons tests.

From September 1946 to July 1948, he was assistant chief of staff for pilots of the 58th Bombardment Wing and then Eighth Air Force director of operations. For the next three years, he commanded the 509th Bombardment Group at Walker Air Force Base, New Mexico. Between July 1951 and June 1956, Ryan commanded the 97th Bombardment Wing and the 810th Air Division, both at Biggs Air Force Base, Texas, and the 19th Air Division at Carswell Air Force Base, Texas.

Ryan became director of materiel for the Strategic Air Command in June 1956, and four years later assumed command of SAC&#x27;s Sixteenth Air Force in Spain. In July 1961, he was named commander of the Second Air Force at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana. In August 1963, Ryan was assigned to the Pentagon as Inspector General of the Air Force. A year later, he was named vice commander in chief of the Strategic Air Command (SAC) at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska.

== Strategic Air Command ==

In November 1964 Ryan was appointed as the next Commanders-in-Chief of The Strategic Air Command (CINCSAC) following the retirement of the current CINCSAC General Thomas S. Power. Ryan assumed his duties as CINCSAC On December 1, 1964, and became its fourth commander in chief and was the first CINCSAC to be educated at West Point. During his tenure as Strategic Air Command Commander, Ryan oversaw the early staged of Strategic Bombing campaign during the Vietnam War and also Strategic Air Command role within the war. As part of the Strategic Air Command involvement in the Vietnam War, Ryan under the direction of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara ordered the deployment of several Strategic Air Command fleet of B-52 Stratofortress and Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker into Southeast Asia. The B-52 and Boeing KC-135 fleet was then deployed into U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield following an agreement with Governments of Thailand and operating the base in-cooperation with Royal Thai Navy. As a result, the U-Tapao airbase became the main Strategic Air Command base for its Southeast Asian operation, especially for its operation for the Vietnam War air campaign.

Ryan also the early staged of Operation Arc Light, which purpose was to provide bombing support that include enemy bases and supply routes and also providing air support for ground combat operations. In order to support the Operation Arc Light, several fleet of Strategic Air Command&#x27;s Bombers Aircraft, including its fleet of B-52 Stratofortress was deployed into Andersen Air Force Base in Guam and Kadena Air Force Base in Okinawa, Japan. Operation Arc Light played crucial role in the strategic bombing campaign during the Vietnam War and especially in providing the bombing air support to ground combat troops in the battlefield of Vietnam.

On February 1, 1967, Ryan was assigned as commander in chief, of The Pacific Air Forces and was succeeded by his Vice Commanders-in-Chief General Joseph J. Nazzaro, who assumed Ryan&#x27;s position as Strategic Air Command Commanders-in-Chief.

== Air Force Chief of Staff ==

Ryan returned to the Pentagon as Vice Chief of Staff of The United States Air Force in August 1968, following the appointment of the previous Air Force Vice Chief of Staff, General Bruce K. Holloway, as Commander of the Strategic Air Command. In July 1969 following the retirement of Air Force Chief of Staff General John P. McConnell, Ryan was appointed by President Richard Nixon as Chief of Staff of The United States Air Force in August 1969. One of the more controversial moves of his tenure was the disbandment of the U.S. Air Force Pipes and Drums, the only free-standing, full-time pipe band in the U.S. armed forces.

Ryan&#x27;s tenure as commander of PACAF and later as Air Force Chief of Staff also engendered controversy when he was described as one of a group that helped destroy General Jack Lavelle&#x27;s career after Lavelle gave fighter pilots permission to shoot back at bona fide threats, something previously denied them by rules of engagement. This was also related to the court-martial of Colonel Jack Broughton, after Broughton attempted to protect one of his pilots who shot back at an anti-aircraft position also in apparent violation of rules of engagement. Ryan&#x27;s &quot;undue command influence&quot; later resulted in the overturning and expungement of Broughton&#x27;s conviction by the USAF Board for the Correction of Military Records. During his tenure as Air Force Chief of Staff, Ryan also realized that the Air Force was in need of a complete overhaul that emphasized training, readiness and understanding.

According to Mark Perry 1989 military history book &quot;Four Stars: The Inside Story of The Forty-Year Battle Between The Joint Chiefs of Staff and America&#x27;s Civilian Leaders&quot;, Ryan was considered one of the Air Force&#x27;s major air power strategists in the end of 1960s and was one of the able successors to Curtis LeMay and Thomas D. White. Ryan was also quoted as one of the military&#x27;s leading critics of the can-do spirit which permeated the New Frontier-Great Society national Leadership. Ryan was also quoted as one of the more outspoken and &quot;stronger Chiefs&quot; within the Joint Chiefs of Staff parlance, especially regarding the slanting of a policy or story that far beyond the truth.

General Ryan retired from active-duty within the United States Air Force on July 31, 1973, following 35 years of service within the Air Force. He was succeeded by General George S. Brown who assumed Ryan&#x27;s position as Chief of Staff of The United States Air Force and was previously served as Commanders of Air Force System Command.

== Family and death ==
Ryan&#x27;s son, General Michael E. Ryan, also held the position of chief of staff. Unlike the elder Ryan&#x27;s career as bomber pilot, the younger Ryan (b. 1941) and his brother John (1940–1970) were both fighter pilots.

Ryan died of a heart attack at age 67 on October 27, 1983, while hospitalized at the Air Force&#x27;s Wilford Hall Medical Center adjacent to Lackland AFB in San Antonio, Texas. He was later buried with full military honors at the United States Air Force Academy Cemetery in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He was survived by his wife, the former Jo Carolyn Guidera, his son, Colonel (later General) Michael E. Ryan, and a daughter, Patricia Jo Ryan. Another son, Captain John D. Ryan, Jr., was killed in 1970 when his F-4 Phantom II crashed into San Pablo Bay during a training mission, shortly after takeoff from Hamilton AFB in Marin County, California.

==Awards and decorations==

===Other achievements===
In December 1962, he joined a select group of athletes, who have been successful in their professional careers since their college football days, when he was chosen a member of the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Silver Anniversary All-American team. He received an honorary doctor of laws degree from Creighton University, Omaha, Nebraska, on May 30, 1966; and an honorary doctor of laws degree from the University of Akron, Ohio, on June 5, 1967.

In July 1971, Ryan became the first foreign dignitary to receive the Golden Wings of the Philippine Air Force. Additional foreign decorations are Chilean Military Star of the Armed Forces, Class of Great Star for Military Merit.

<text>ITV3 is a British free-to-air television channel owned by ITV Digital Channels, a division of ITV plc. The channel was first launched on Monday 1 November 2004 at 9 pm, replacing Plus (previously known as G+). ITV3 is the sixth-largest UK television channel by audience share and the largest after the five main terrestrial services, the position which was previously held by its sister station ITV2. The channel is primarily devoted to repeats of ITV dramas, and including sequential reruns of &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;, &quot;Classic Coronation Street&quot;, &quot;Classic Emmerdale&quot;, &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; and &quot;A Touch of Frost&quot;, amongst others, as well as formerly showing repeats of &quot;Kojak&quot;, &quot;Numb3rs&quot;, &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; and &quot;The Bill&quot;, but occasionally shows popular factual programming and is also used as an overflow location for ITV&#x27;s sports coverage. ITV3&#x27;s broadcast hours are from 6am to 2:30am with home shopping and &quot;Unwind with ITV&quot; aired overnight.

==History==
ITV3 was launched on the terrestrial (Freeview), cable (NTL and Telewest), broadband (HomeChoice) and digital satellite (Sky) on 1 November 2004 at 9:00pm, with the UKTV premiere of Ian Rankin&#x27;s Rebus. It is also available on TalkTalk TV IPTV and Freesat.

ITV3 was originally conceived as &#x27;ITV Gold&#x27;, when ITV was looking to maximise their multichannel presence due to the growth of digital TV and the Freeview platform, but was faced with lack of space on the Sky platform due to technical limitations and the rights to certain ITV programmes being held by GSkyB, a joint venture run by ITV and Sky which operated a suite of pay TV channels. ITV took full control of Granada Sky Broadcasting, and ceased broadcasting the Granada Plus channel, thereby allowing ITV3 to take the channel number, bandwidth, and programme rights, meaning all platforms could receive the channel from launch. ITV3 was also the only channel in the ITV brand not to simulcast CITV breakfast, until ITV launched two channels in 2014, ITVBe and ITV Encore.

On 10 October 2006, ITV announced to launch a one-hour timeshift service of ITV3, titled ITV3 +1. The channel launched on 30 October 2006 along with ITV2 +1.

The channel had been available from launch on UPC Ireland, but was withdrawn on 22 March 2006. This is believed to have been at the request of ITV plc, which had previously barred Irish newspapers from publishing details of ITV channels and regions other than UTV and Men &amp; Motors. The channel had already been (and remains) available to Irish viewers on free-to-air satellite for some time, however it has not been listed in the Sky electronic programme guide since its removal on 25 January 2006. ITV3 returned to UPC Ireland in the Republic of Ireland on 4 January 2010.

As Freeview announced plans for a retune on 30 September 2009, ITV3 moved to an alternative multiplex. Viewers in areas that have completed switchover who receive their signal from a local relay transmitter not carrying the commercial multiplexes were no longer be able to receive ITV3. It was moved back on 28 March 2018.

On 1 April 2011, ITV3 was removed from UPC Ireland along with ITV2 and ITV4 due to the expiry of a carriage agreement between UPC and ITV. UPC Ireland claim that ITV is not in a position to renegotiate the deal because ITV had struck a deal with another channel provider to provide it with exclusive rights to air certain content from the channels. Conversely, UPC Ireland also claims to have been in discussions right up to the last moment in order to continue broadcasting the channels.

<text>Patrick John Ryan (February 20, 1831 – February 11, 1911) was an Irish-born Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of Philadelphia from 1884 until his death in 1911.

==Early life and education==
Patrick Ryan was born in Thurles, County Tipperary, to Jeremiah and Mary Tuohy Ryan. His father died when Patrick was nine years old.

He received his early education from the Christian Brothers at Thurles, and attended a private school in Dublin from 1842 to 1847. In 1844, he led a delegation of students to Richmond Bridewell Prison, where he delivered an address to the imprisoned Daniel O&#x27;Connell. He completed his theological studies at Carlow College in 1852, his education supported by &quot;The Foreign Mission Fund&quot;, and was ordained a subdeacon.

In the same year he left Ireland for the United States, in the company of Patrick Feehan, later Archbishop of Chicago. Ryan became attached to the Archdiocese of St. Louis in Missouri. He then served as a professor of English literature at the seminary in Carondelet for a year.

==Priesthood==
Ryan was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Peter Richard Kenrick on September 8, 1853. At age 21, he was below the age requirement for ordination but was granted a dispensation by Pope Pius IX. He was then appointed an assistant rector at the Cathedral of St. Louis, and was advanced to rector in 1856. In 1860, he was named pastor of the Church of the Annunciation in St. Louis, where he built a church and parochial school. During the Civil War, he served as a chaplain for prisoners of war at the Gratiot Street Prison. In the same parish was a government military hospital. Every day Ryan visited the Confederate prisoners and the Union wounded.

Following the war, he was transferred to St. John&#x27;s Church in St. Louis, and accompanied Archbishop Kenrick, as theologian, to the Second Plenary Council of Baltimore in 1866. While on a visit to Europe in 1868, he delivered the English course of Lenten lectures in Rome at the invitation of Pius IX. Upon his return to St. Louis later that year, he was made vicar general of the Archdiocese. He administered the Archdiocese while Archbishop Kenrick attended the First Vatican Council.

==Episcopacy==

On February 15, 1872, Ryan was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of St. Louis and Titular Archbishop of Tricomia by Pius IX. He received his episcopal consecration on the following April 14 from Archbishop Kenrick, with Archbishop Patrick Feehan and Bishop Joseph Melcher serving as co-consecrators. His titular see was changed to Salamis on January 6, 1884. After the death of Archbishop James Frederick Wood, Ryan was named the second Archbishop of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on June 8, 1884. His installation took place at the Cathedral of SS. Peter and Paul on the following August 20.

During his 27-year-long tenure, Ryan erected 170 churches and 82 schools; increased the number of priests by 322 and nuns by 1,545; and oversaw a rise in the Catholic population from 300,000 to 525,000. During that time also the Roman Catholic High School for Boys was built, and put in operation; high school centers for girls taught by the different communities were established; a new central high school for girls was partly endowed and begun; St. Francis&#x27; Industrial School for Boys was endowed and successfully operated, the Philadelphia Protectory for Boys was erected; St. Joseph&#x27;s Home for Working Boys was founded; a new foundling asylum and maternity hospital was built; a new St. Vincent&#x27;s Home for younger orphan children was purchased with the archbishop&#x27;s Golden Jubilee Fund of $200,000; a third Home for the Aged was erected; a Memorial Library Building, dedicated to the Archbishop, was begun at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary; and the three Catholic hospitals of the city doubled their capacity. In 1886, as chairman of the negotiating committee, he helped mediate a labor dispute between management and city trolley car workers, which resulted in a 10-hour work day and recognition of the right to unionize.

He also established national churches in the diocese for the Italians, Poles, Greeks, Slovaks, Lithuanians, and several other nationalities. Ryan was a spiritual advisor to Katharine Drexel. He founded two congregations for African Americans, and the Spiritans founded an establishment in Cornwells Heights.

Known for his skill in public speaking, in 1879, Cardinal John McCloskey selected Ryan to make the address at the dedication of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. Ryan would later preach the sermon at McCloskey&#x27;s funeral in 1885. James Gibbons chose Ryan to speak on the occasion Gibbons was made cardinal. New York University awarded Ryan an honorary Doctor of Laws degree, as did the University of Pennsylvania. He was appointed to the U.S. Indian Commission by President Theodore Roosevelt. In 1888, he again visited Rome, and presented Pope Leo XIII with a gift from President Grover Cleveland.

Ryan died at age 79. The Archbishop is described as &quot;..a man of strong opinions who navigates the stormy waters of the nineteenth and early twentieth-century church without either making many enemies or compromising his basic beliefs.&quot;

<text>Thomas Francis Ryan (1872 – November 19, 1961) was a Canadian sportsman and entrepreneur who created five-pin bowling.

Born in Guelph, Ontario, Ryan moved to Toronto at age 18. He is said to have been a baseball pitcher good enough for a professional offer, although the details are sketchy.

Ryan had been running a pool hall on Yonge Street and in November 1905 co-founded the Toronto Bowling Club above a store at Yonge and Temperance Street. Ten-pin bowling had been growing in popularity, but some of Ryan&#x27;s customers complained that the ball was too heavy. Around 1909 he devised a new game with a smaller ball and only five pins, with a new scoring system. After receiving complaints about the pins bouncing out the window to the street, he added a rubber ring around the pins.

Ryan purchased the Turtle Hall Hotel in Toronto in April 1914 for $45,000. He later bought the former home of the Massey family, which he converted into an antique gallery and auction house. For decades, he was a judge of the Miss Toronto pageant. He remained a bachelor until he was 82, when he married his secretary.

Ryan died in Toronto at age 89. He was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 1971. He is buried in the Mount Hope Catholic Cemetery in Toronto, Ontario.

<text>Thomas Fortune Ryan (October 17, 1851 – November 23, 1928) was an American tobacco, insurance and transportation magnate. Although he lived in New York City for much of his adult career, Ryan was perhaps the greatest benefactor of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Richmond in the decades before the Great Depression. In addition to paying for schools, hospitals and other charitable works, Ryan&#x27;s donations paid for the construction of the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart in Richmond, Virginia. Ryan also made significant donations to Catholic institutions in New York City and Washington, D.C.

==Early days==
Thomas Fortune Ryan was born on October 17, 1851, near Lovingston, Virginia, the county seat of Nelson County. Despite a myth promulgated by Cleveland Amory regarding his background, Ryan was neither orphaned nor penniless as a youth, nor did his ancestors flee the Great Famine of Ireland as did many who worked on or rode his streetcars. Rural Virginia where Ryan grew up attracted few of those emigrants. Ryan&#x27;s father was a tailor and managed a small hotel. He traced his ancestry to Protestant Anglo-Irish settlers who came to North America in the seventeenth century.

Ryan&#x27;s mother, Lucinda Fortune Ryan, died in 1856 when he was five years old. His father remarried and moved to Tennessee two years later. Ryan was raised as a Protestant by his mother&#x27;s extended family in Lovingston, south of Charlottesville in Virginia&#x27;s Piedmont. Local Baptist ministers taught the youth to read and write, but Ryan did not attend college. Before the American Civil War, Ryan and his younger brother owned three slaves.

==Conversion==
Aged 17, three years after the war ended, Ryan fled the lack of economic opportunity in post-war Virginia and moved to the nearest big city, Baltimore, Maryland, with $100 in his pocket. En route, Ryan converted to Catholicism, purportedly after long discussions with the conductor.

In Baltimore, John S. Barry, a prosperous dry goods merchant and Catholic, hired young Ryan. By 1872, Barry helped Ryan secure a brokerage assistant position on Wall Street where he would be tutored by William Collins Whitney.

== Fortune building ==
Ryan opened a brokerage firm with two partners, Lee, Ryan &amp; Warren, the following year.

In 1873 Ryan married his former boss&#x27;s daughter, Ida Mary Barry, whose family were devout Roman Catholics. They had eight children. In 1874, his firm purchased Ryan a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. At the same time, Ryan became active in politics, especially with the Tammany Hall machine that controlled much of the city&#x27;s operations, giving him political and industrial contacts across the city.

Ryan&#x27;s fortune began in public transit. In 1883, he founded the New York Cable Railroad and bid on the proposed route from lower Manhattan to Midtown. After numerous legal and financial problems, in 1886 Ryan reorganized his cable railroad as the Metropolitan Traction Company. By 1893, construction of Ryan&#x27;s rail system was underway on Broadway. Metropolitan continually acquired additional lines so that by 1900 it controlled 3,000 cars and 300 miles of track, the majority of New York&#x27;s streetcar operations. 

Ryan&#x27;s most profitable investment was tobacco. Having invested in its stocks throughout the 1890s, Ryan joined tobacco assets in 1898, forming The Union Tobacco Company. Shortly thereafter, he merged Union Tobacco with his greatest competitor, James Duke of North Carolina, forming the American Tobacco Company. Together Ryan and Duke developed the British-American Tobacco Company to protect the American tobacco trade in Europe. Upon his death, Ryan also had major holdings in R. J. Reynolds and Liggett &amp; Myers.

In 1905, amid public outcry, Ryan purchased the $400-million-strong Equitable Life Assurance Society, a major factor in the insurance industry. Although Ryan strove to make Equitable more responsive to its policy holders, public reaction to his purchase was overwhelmingly negative. His reputation for cutthroat business dealings in the streetcar and subway businesses made the public distrustful. In 1909, Ryan sold his Equitable stock. Also in 1905, Ryan&#x27;s Metropolitan street car system was threatened by New York&#x27;s increasingly popular subway system. He merged Metropolitan with August Belmont Jr.&#x27;s Interborough Rapid Transit Company. But the joint company&#x27;s finances were shaky, and Ryan pulled out. Meanwhile, some $35 million that Ryan had raised in a bond issue were misappropriated. Ryan was investigated for corruption in 1908, but the grand jury brought no charges.

Ryan also invested in King Leopold II&#x27;s Congo Free State. In 1906, he cofounded the American Congo Company with Daniel Guggenheim. He was also an investor in other Belgian colonial concession companies, including the diamond and lumber conglomerate Forminière.

Meanwhile, Ryan was making fortunes with coal mines, banks, public utilities and railroads. He owned Royal Typewriter and backed the maker of the Thompson submachine gun. At one time Ryan had controlling interest in 30 corporations.

==Philanthropy==
As her husband&#x27;s wealth grew exponentially, Ida Barry Ryan began making large benefactions to Catholic charitable organizations in New York, Virginia, and across the country. The Ryans funded churches, convents and hospitals in Manhattan, including the architecturally important St. Jean Baptiste Catholic Church on the Upper East Side. In Washington, D.C., they paid for a gymnasium and dormitory at the Jesuit-founded Georgetown University.

In 1901, the Ryans funded the construction of Sacred Heart Church and Sacred Heart School on Perry Street in Manchester, Virginia (now part of Richmond). In the same year, the Ryans donated $250,000 to build a new cathedral in Richmond and soon doubled that donation to ensure that the interior would be of the highest workmanship. The Cathedral of the Sacred Heart, whose cornerstone was laid by the apostolic delegate on June 4, 1903, was dedicated by the same nuncio on November 29, 1906, and remains one of the metropolitan area&#x27;s architectural landmarks. Other Ryan gifts in Virginia included the Cathedral High and the Cathedral Primary schools in Richmond.

In October 1903, Ryan and his wife donated a two-story brick and steam heated building near the Newport News Shipyard to the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth so they could start a Catholic girls school (to be named St. Vincent&#x27;s de Paul School and later renamed Peninsula Catholic High School). In June 1904, they donated a new building for the Sisters and their 104 students in their charge. The Ryans also financed construction of Catholic churches in Harrisonburg and Charlottesville.

Pope Pius X recognized the couple&#x27;s generosity by naming him to the papal nobility and giving Ida Ryan the cross &quot;Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice&quot; for her work in the Diocese. The couple&#x27;s lifetime contributions to Catholic charities around the country totalled $20 million. However, Mrs. Ryan refused to allow any funds to be used for &quot;colored work&quot; (including schools and hospitals for Virginia&#x27;s freed blacks, despite diocesan missionary priorities of the time).

The Ryans&#x27; philanthropy also extended to Southern history, the fine arts and exploration. Ryan financed and selected Charles Hoffbauer to create a series of paintings, &quot;The Four Seasons of the Confederacy&quot;, commissioned for a major gallery in what is now the Virginia Historical Society. For Jamestown&#x27;s 300th anniversary in 1907, Ryan donated a collection of portraits of key players in Virginia&#x27;s settlement. Thomas Ryan also helped finance Virginia explorer Richard E. Byrd&#x27;s flight to the South Pole. 

In 1887, the Ryans bought the Groesbeck mansion near Suffern, New York in what is today the village of Montebello in the Town of Ramapo, a major municipality on the Erie Railroad, and rebuilt it into a summer home they called &quot;Montebello&quot;. During the three decades before her death, Ida Barry Ryan funded the construction of the Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, as well as the Good Samaritan Hospital.

==Later years==
Ryan announced his intention to retire in 1912. Re-establishing his roots in his native state of Virginia, he had since 1901 maintained &quot;Oak Ridge&quot; in Nelson County, formerly the estate of tobacco trader William Rives and later of former Confederate and U.S. Congressman William Porcher Miles. Ryan also became a Virginia delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1912, which selected fellow Virginian Woodrow Wilson as the party&#x27;s presidential candidate.

In 1916, Thomas Fortune Ryan was also the principal financial backer of John T. Thompson&#x27;s Auto-Ordnance Company for the purpose of developing his &quot;auto rifle&quot; and the Thompson Submachine-Gun.

On October 17, 1917, on his 66th birthday, his wife Ida died from heart disease. Twelve days later, Ryan married widow Mary Townsend Lord Cuyler. The resulting scandal did not deter Belgian Cardinal Desire-Joseph Mercier from accepting Ryan&#x27;s proffered private railway car in 1919, which he used in touring the United States and accepting honorary degrees and awards concerning his country&#x27;s defense against the invading Germans.

==Death and legacy==
On November 23, 1928, Thomas Fortune Ryan died, the South&#x27;s wealthiest native son and the nation&#x27;s 10th wealthiest man. He left a fortune of more than $200 million. He was buried on his Oak Ridge estate, as was his second wife, Mary. Although a place had been reserved for Ida Barry Ryan in the crypt of Richmond&#x27;s Sacred Heart Cathedral, she was ultimately interred in the cemetery at St. Andrews-on-Hudson Seminary in Hyde Park, New York (now The Culinary Institute of America).

Ryan&#x27;s eldest son John Barry Ryan (1874–1942) became a financier and writer. His grandson Allan A. Ryan Jr. (1903–1981) was a New York State Senator from 1939 to 1942. His granddaughter Sally Ryan was a noted art collector. A great-granddaughter was Virginia Fortune Ryan Ogilvy, Countess of Airlie (1933–2024), wife of David Ogilvy, 13th Earl of Airlie. Grandson Joseph Bondurant Ryan (1906–1950) was the developer of the Mont Tremblant ski resort in Quebec. Joseph&#x27;s son Peter (1940–1962) was the first Canadian to compete in Formula 1 auto racing and the winner of the first Canadian Grand Prix in 1961. Grandson Clendenin J. Ryan Jr. (1905–1957) was an American businessman best known as the publisher and owner of &quot;The American Mercury&quot; magazine.

<doc id="747856" wikidata="Q44420" url="?curid=747856" title="Giovanni Trapattoni">
<text>Giovanni Trapattoni (; born 17 March 1939), popularly nicknamed &quot;Trap&quot; or &quot;Il Trap&quot;, is an Italian football manager and former player, considered the most successful club coach of Italian football. A former defensive midfielder, as a player he spent almost his entire club career with AC Milan, where he won two Serie A league titles (1961–62 and 1967–68), and two European Cups, in 1962–63 and 1968–69. Internationally, he played for Italy, earning 17 caps and being part of the squad at the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile.

One of the most celebrated managers in football history, Trapattoni is one of only five coaches, alongside Carlo Ancelotti, Ernst Happel, Tomislav Ivić and José Mourinho, to have won league titles in four different European countries; in total, Trapattoni has won 10 league titles in Italy, Germany, Portugal and Austria. Alongside Udo Lattek and José Mourinho, he is one of the three coaches to have won all three major European club competitions (European Cup, UEFA Cup, UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup) and the only one to achieve it with the same club (Juventus). Also, he is the only one to have won all official continental club competitions and the world title, achieving this with Juventus during his first spell with the club. He is one of the rare few to have won the European Cup, the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and Intercontinental Cup as both a player and manager.

Regarded as the most famous and consistent disciple of Nereo Rocco, Trapattoni coached his native Italy national team to the 2002 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2004, but could not replicate his club successes with Italy, suffering a controversial early exit in both competitions. Trapattoni was most recently the manager of the Republic of Ireland national football team. He led them to their first European Championships in 24 years, enjoying a successful UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying campaign. This followed narrowly missing out on the 2010 FIFA World Cup, after his team were controversially knocked out by France.

==Club career==

Born in Cusano Milanino near Milan, Trapattoni had a successful career as a player with AC Milan, playing either as a central defender or as a defensive midfielder with the main task of passing the ball to more creative players such as Giovanni Lodetti and Gianni Rivera. He won two Serie A titles (1961–1962, 1967–1968) and two European Cups (1962–1963, 1968–1969) during his time with Milan, and was one of the stars of the 1963 European Cup Final against Benfica, successfully man-marking Eusébio in the second half. Similarly, in the team&#x27;s 4–1 victory in the 1969 European Cup Final against Ajax, he drew praise in the Italian media for his defending and ability to nullify the offensive threat of Johan Cruyff.

After taking a break from the national team, Trapattoni thought he could settle with a mid-table team for one last season instead of being at one club all his life, subsequently moving to Varese and, after a successful season with them, retired from professional football and embarked on a highly successful managerial career two years later.

==International career==
Trapattoni also played for the Italy national football team between 1960 and 1964, earning 17 caps and scoring 1 goal. Most notably, he was part of the squad at the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile, although he was unable to play any matches during the tournament after sustaining an injury. He was also part of Italy&#x27;s squad at the 1960 Summer Olympics.

Trapattoni is also remembered for his performance in Italy&#x27;s 3–0 friendly victory over Brazil at the San Siro stadium in Milan on 12 May 1963; during the match, he was able to nullify Pelé&#x27;s impact on the game through his man-marking ability, with the latter asking to be substituted for Quarentinha in the 26th minute of the second half, whom Trapattoni also successfully defended. However, Pelé later stated in 2000 that his performance was due to stomach pains, and that he was forced to play due to contractual obligations; Trapattoni himself also frequently downplayed Pelé&#x27;s performance during the match, even prior to Pelé&#x27;s comments, stating: &quot;the truth is that on that day he was half-injured. Tired. I was a good footballer, but let&#x27;s leave Pelé alone. He was a martian.&quot;

==Style of play==
A talented defensive-minded player, Trapattoni was capable of playing both in defence, as a centre-back, and in midfield, as a defensive midfielder, due to his work-rate and ability to win back possession and subsequently distribute the ball forward to his more offensive-minded teammates. Above all, he was known for his excellent man-marking skills.

==Coaching career==

===1974–1986: Early career at AC Milan and Juventus===
Trapattoni began coaching at Milan as a youth team coach, before becoming caretaker coach. Trapattoni was caretaker coach from 9 April 1974 to 30 June 1974. His first match was the 1973–74 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup semi–final first leg against Borussia Mönchengladbach. Milan won the match 2–0. They got to the final after only losing the second leg 1–0. Milan lost the final 2–0 to East German club 1. FC Magdeburg. Milan finished seventh in Serie A. He was appointed first team coach in 1975.
Trapattoni was head coach for Juventus for ten consecutive years, from 1 July 1976 to 30 June 1986. Trapattoni won all UEFA and international club competitions during this time (a European record).

He won the Serie A league title six times (1976–77, 1977–78, 1980–81, 1981–82, 1983–84, 1985–86), the Coppa Italia twice (1978–79 and 1982–83), the European Cup in 1984–85, the Intercontinental Cup in 1985, the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1983–84, the European Super Cup in 1984, and the UEFA Cup in 1976–77.

Apart from winning the European Cup over Liverpool in 1984–85, Trapattoni came close to conquering the trophy on another occasion, in 1982–83, but Juventus suffered a surprising defeat at the hands of Hamburg in the Athens final, finishing as runners-up.

During his years managing Juventus, Trapattoni established himself as one of the best managers in football history, well-known and respected among fans and journalists throughout Europe. He was renowned for combining expert man-management with almost unmatched tactical knowledge.

===1986–1994: Inter Milan and return to Juventus===
Trapattoni coached Inter Milan from 1 July 1986 to 30 June 1991. While in charge of Inter, he won the Serie A in 1988–89, the Supercoppa Italiana in 1989 and the UEFA Cup in 1990–91.

He then managed Juventus for a second time between 1991 and 1994, winning the UEFA Cup in 1992–93.

===1994–1996: Bayern Munich, return to Serie A ===
Trapattoni became coach of Bayern Munich in the summer of 1994, after the end of his second spell with Juventus. However, he left at the end of the 1994–95 season, after complaints that he struggled with German. He reached the semi-finals of the Champions League, but failing to win any silverware.

Trapattoni coached Cagliari in the 1995–96 season. His first match was a 1–0 loss to Udinese on 26 August 1995. The club&#x27;s board of directors decided to dismiss him in February 1996, after a string of bad results; Trapattoni was thus fired for the first time in his career. His final match was a 4–1 loss to Juventus. Cagliari were in 13th place at the time of his sacking.

===1996–2000: Back to Bayern Munich and Fiorentina===
Trapattoni returned to manage Bayern again in July 1996. As Bayern manager Trapattoni won the German Bundesliga in 1996–97, the German Cup (DFB-Pokal) in 1997–98 and the German League Cup (DFB-Ligapokal) in 1997. He left Bayern at the end of the 1997–98 season and was replaced by Ottmar Hitzfeld.

Trapattoni coached Fiorentina from 1998 to 2000. With Trapattoni&#x27;s expert guidance, Fiorentina made a serious challenge for the title in 1998–99, finishing the season in 3rd place, which earned them qualification to the Champions League, also reaching the 1999 Coppa Italia Final, but losing out to Parma. The following season was rather disappointing in Serie A, with Fiorentina finishing in 7th place, but Trapattoni led them to some historic results in the Champions League, beating Arsenal 1–0 at the old Wembley Stadium in the first round, and defeating defending champions Manchester United 2–0 and eventual runners-up Valencia 1–0 in Florence in the second round. They were ultimately eliminated after finishing third in their group behind the latter two sides following a 3–3 draw against Bordeaux in their final second round match.

===2000–2004: Italy national team===
In July 2000, Trapattoni took charge of the Italy national football team after the resignation of Dino Zoff. He led the team to the 2002 FIFA World Cup, qualifying undefeated to that tournament.

Prior to the tournament, Trapattoni was surrounded by controversy after he omitted fan favourite Roberto Baggio – who had recently recovered from injury – from Italy&#x27;s final 23-man squad, as he believed that the player was not yet fully fit. Italy were drawn in Group G of the tournament with Ecuador, Croatia and Mexico. They won their first match, beating Ecuador 2–0, but then suffered a surprise 2–1 defeat at the hands of Croatia. In their final group game, Italy drew 1–1 with Mexico, securing qualification to the Round of 16 with a second-place finish in their group, where they faced tournament co-hosts South Korea. Italy lost 2–1 and were eliminated from the World Cup, conceding an equaliser two minutes from full-time and losing in extra time with Ahn Jung-Hwan scoring the golden goal. The game was highly controversial with members of the Italian team, most notably Trapattoni and forward Francesco Totti, suggesting a conspiracy to eliminate Italy from the competition. Trapattoni even obliquely accused FIFA of ordering the official to ensure a South Korean victory so that one of the two host nations would remain in the tournament. The most contentious decisions were an early penalty awarded to South Korea (saved by Gianluigi Buffon), a golden goal by Damiano Tommasi ruled offside, and the sending off of Totti, who received a second yellow card for an alleged dive in the penalty area, all ruled by the referee Byron Moreno. Following the team&#x27;s exit, Italy were criticised in the Italian and International press for their poor performance and ultra-defensive playing style under Trapattoni, who also came under fire in the Italian media for his tactics, which included initially refusing to play two of the team&#x27;s star playmakers – Alessandro Del Piero and Francesco Totti – alongside one another during the tournament, and substituting a forward – Del Piero – for a holding midfielder – Gennaro Gattuso – in the second half of Italy&#x27;s round of 16 match, in order to attempt to defend their 1–0 lead against South Korea.
Italy went on to secure qualification for UEFA Euro 2004 easily, but once again failed to impress at the tournament itself. They were drawn in Group C with Denmark, Sweden and Bulgaria. They drew 0–0 with Denmark and 1–1 with Sweden, beating Bulgaria 2–1 in their final group game. This led to an unexpected early exit from the tournament, despite Italy being undefeated. Denmark and Sweden drew in the group&#x27;s final match, eliminating Italy who finished in third place of Group C, on account of goal difference. More specifically, Sweden, Denmark and Italy all finished with five points, with each team having defeated Bulgaria but drawn their two other games. As all results between the three teams in question were draws, both the points won in these games and the goal difference accrued in these games still left the teams undivided. The decisive tiebreaker was therefore the goals scored during the games between one another: Italy, having scored the fewest goals of the three teams, were therefore eliminated.

Trapattoni later said: &quot;Sweden against Denmark, I remember the game. Do you know what Johansson [the then UEFA president Lennart Johansson] said? &#x27;If this game finishes in a draw, we will open an investigation&#x27; Do you know if he made the investigation? I&#x27;m still waiting for the investigation.&quot; These comments came eight years later, in 2012.

Marcello Lippi replaced Trapattoni on 15 July 2004.

===2004–2008: Benfica, Stuttgart, and Red Bull Salzburg===
On 5 July 2004, Trapattoni was named as new coach of Benfica. He led them to the 2004–05 Portuguese league title, which was the club&#x27;s first in 11 years. Benfica also reached the Portuguese Cup final that season, but lost to Vitória de Setúbal. Benfica also lost 1–0 to rivals Porto in the 2004 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira. Trapattoni resigned after the end of the 2004–05 season, saying he wanted to be closer to his family (in the north of Italy).

Trapattoni returned to management in the German Bundesliga in June 2005, by signing at VfB Stuttgart. However, during his 20 games at the helm, Stuttgart produced poor results. Denmark internationals Jon Dahl Tomasson and Jesper Grønkjær openly criticised their coach, claiming he was afraid to attack. Trapattoni immediately responded by dropping both players to the bench. With the atmosphere in the team worsening, he was sacked after just seven months, on 9 February 2006, reportedly for &quot;not fulfilling the ambitions of the club&quot;. He was replaced as manager by Armin Veh.

In May 2006, Red Bull Salzburg announced they had signed Trapattoni as their new manager and Director of Football, along with one of his former players, Lothar Matthäus, who was to serve as Trapattoni&#x27;s co-manager. Trapattoni initially cast doubt on this report, claiming he had not signed any contract. But three days later, both he and Matthäus signed and made their hirings official. As he had done with Benfica in Portugal two years before, Trapattoni managed to deliver instantly, winning the league title after a long period of failures for the club; he secured the 2006–07 Austrian Bundesliga, which was Salzburg&#x27;s first in 10 years. At the end of the season, the club&#x27;s board of directors unanimously decided to dismiss Matthäus, and Thorsten Fink became Trapattoni&#x27;s assistant manager.

===2008–2013: Republic of Ireland national team===
On 11 February 2008, Trapattoni &quot;agreed in principle&quot; to take over the Republic of Ireland manager&#x27;s job, but finished the season with Red Bull before taking up the Irish position on 1 May. Former Ireland midfielder Liam Brady was expected to be part of the Italian&#x27;s backroom staff, while Marco Tardelli was confirmed as Trapattoni&#x27;s assistant manager. Trapattoni signed Brady back in 1980 for Juventus from Arsenal for just over £500,000. Red Bull Salzburg confirmed, on 13 February 2008, that at the end of the 2007–08 season, Trapattoni would be leaving the club to take over as the Republic of Ireland manager. Manuela Spinelli became Trapattoni&#x27;s interpreter. Because of her ability to speak both Italian and English, she became a familiar sight alongside him during most interviews. She also appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; without Trapattoni.

Trapattoni&#x27;s first game in charge, a friendly against Serbia on 24 May 2008, ended in a 1–1 draw. His second, another friendly, against Colombia five days later, meant his first victory with the national side, 1–0. This was followed by a 1–1 draw with Norway, his first competitive win against Georgia and a draw with Montenegro in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification.

Trapattoni&#x27;s first defeat came in a friendly against Poland on 19 November 2008, a 3–2 loss at Croke Park. He also managed to claim a 1–1 away draw against 2006 FIFA World Cup champions Italy, that he had managed himself from 2000 to 2004, thanks to a late equaliser from Robbie Keane. He finished the qualifying campaign unbeaten, becoming only the third Irish manager to do so, qualifying for a playoff place for the 2010 World Cup.

In September 2009, he signed a new contract with Ireland that would have seen him continue as manager until UEFA Euro 2012. In the first leg of the World Cup playoff in Croke Park on 14 November 2009, France won 1–0 with a goal by Nicolas Anelka. In the second leg in Paris, on 18 November 2009, a goal from Robbie Keane levelled the aggregate scores at 1–1 in the first half. In extra time, however, a William Gallas equaliser put France through 2–1 on aggregate. Replays of the French goal showed that Thierry Henry had twice used his hand to control the ball and was in an offside position before crossing for Gallas to head home. 

In May 2011, he managed Ireland as they won the Nations Cup, after a 1–0 win against Scotland. Later that year he managed the Ireland national team to UEFA Euro 2012 qualification, following a 5–1 aggregate play-off win against Estonia. Trapattoni was rewarded with a new two-year contract by the Football Association of Ireland (FAI). His success was praised by, among others, Dietmar Hamann.

Ireland exited UEFA Euro 2012 at the group stage, after losing to eventual finalists Spain and Italy. Early in 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification, Ireland suffered a 6–1 defeat to Germany at home with a severely depleted team available. On 29 May 2013, Trapattoni&#x27;s Ireland side faced off against England for the first time in eighteen years at Wembley Stadium in a match which ended 1–1. Trapattoni parted ways with the Republic of Ireland national team on 11 September 2013 by mutual consent, after a defeat by Austria effectively ended their chances of qualification for the 2014 World Cup.

===Vatican City===
Trapattoni has managed the Vatican City national football team who are not a member of either FIFA or UEFA. His first match as manager was played on 23 October 2010 when Vatican City faced a team composed of Italian financial police. Previously, at the age of 71, Trapattoni was quoted as saying &quot;When I retire, I would like to become coach of the Vatican.&quot;

===S. Pietro e Paolo Desio===

In 2015, Trapattoni was symbolically appointed S. Pietro e Paolo Desio&#x27;s manager during the related patronal feast.

==Personal life==

Trapattoni was born in a &quot;cascina a corte&quot; in Cusano Milanino near Milan, and comes from a working-class background. His father Francesco, a native of Barbata near Bergamo, worked in a silk factory and as a farmer, and died when Trapattoni was 18; his mother Romilde was a homemaker. He had one brother and three sisters; one of them, Romilda, became a Roman Catholic nun at 20 and died in January 2013 at the age of 83.

Trapattoni met Paola Miceli in the summer of 1960 in Grottaferrata, during the Rome Olympics. The two began a relationship and married at San Nilo Abbey in Grottaferrata on 3 June 1964. They had a son, Alberto, and a daughter, Alessandra, and later became grandparents and great-grandparents. Miceli died on 29 December 2022, following a long illness.

A devout Roman Catholic, Trapattoni regularly attends Regina Pacis Church in his hometown of Cusano Milanino whenever he is home and is a cooperator of Opus Dei. He has been on pilgrimage to Lourdes and Fátima.

===Health===
In August 2010, Trapattoni was admitted to a hospital in Dublin, one day before Ireland&#x27;s friendly with Argentina. It was initially believed that the shellfish he had eaten before arriving in the country was to blame for him feeling unwell. He underwent surgery in the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital on 11 August, missing the Argentina game. In January 2011, Italian media reported that he was at home recovering from a mild stroke he suffered during a surgery on 28 December 2010, which had caused him partial paralysis. In a statement released through the FAI, Trapattoni confirmed that he did have scheduled surgery in Italy over Christmas, but disproved the rumours about a stroke.

==Style of management==

Considered one of the greatest and most successful managers of all time, Trapattoni is highly regarded for his man-management, motivational and organisational abilities, as well as his tactical acumen, being referred to in international media as &quot;the King of Catenaccio&quot; or the &quot;Old Fox&quot;. He is known in particular for his direct management style and use of rigorous, innovative tactics, while his teams are usually known for their mental strength, organisation, and use of prepared set plays; Trapattoni was the main author and practitioner of the &quot;zona mista&quot; style of play (or &quot;Gioco all&#x27;Italiana&quot;), which was regarded as an evolution of the more traditional and defensive-minded &quot;Catenaccio&quot; system, which had been popularised in Italy by one of his major influences as a manager, Nereo Rocco; Rocco&#x27;s tactics mainly focussed on sitting back and defending, and subsequently scoring on counter-attacks with few touches after winning back the ball. The &quot;zona mista&quot; tactical system came to be known as such as it instead drew elements from both man-marking strategies – such as Italian &quot;catenaccio&quot; – and zonal marking systems – such as the Dutch &quot;total football&quot;; this tactical system dominated Italian football from the mid-1970s until the late 1980s, which saw the emergence of Arrigo Sacchi&#x27;s high-pressing, offensive minded zonal marking system.

Although Trapattoni was known for his defensive minded approach as a manager, his teams often made use of a ball–playing sweeper or &quot;libero&quot; – with good technique, vision, and an ability to read the game – who was responsible both for defending and starting attacking plays from the back, as well as a creative and skilful offensive playmaker in midfield behind the forwards. As such, his teams were known for their defensive strength and playing style, as well as their ability to score from counter-attacks. In 2014, Trapattoni attributed his success and tactical intelligence as a manager to his time playing in midfield throughout his playing career, which allowed him to understand both the offensive and defensive phases of the game. Throughout his career, he used several different formations, including a 4–4–2, a 4–3–1–2, 4–2–3–1, 3–4–1–2, and a 3–5–2, as well as his fluid &quot;zona mista&quot; system; the latter system made use of a sweeper, a man-marking centre-back – or &quot;stopper&quot; –, two full-backs, a defensive midfielder, a &quot;regista&quot; or attacking midfielder, a second striker, and two wingers behind a lone striker or centre-forward, although players would often switch positions in this system, with only the &quot;stopper&quot; having a fixed role. During the latter part of his first spell with Juventus, Trapattoni also deployed striker Paolo Rossi out of position on occasion, either as supporting forward, or as centre-forward, but in a role known as a &quot;centravanti di manovra&quot; in Italian football jargon (similar to the modern false 9 role). The position utlised the offensive attributes of the club&#x27;s new midfield signings Zbigniew Boniek and Michel Platini, with Rossi frequently holding up the ball or creating space for his teammates&#x27; runs with his movement of the ball.

Trapattoni was noted throughout his career for his ideological confrontations with more attack-minded managers he faced, most famously Johan Cruyff, a rivalry that started in their playing days, with Trapattoni remembering that, in order to stop Cruyff in a match between Italy and the Netherlands, he had to resort to &quot;dirty&quot; tactics, such as pulling at his shirt.

Trapattoni&#x27;s tactics throughout his long and successful managerial career focused on some of the following themes:

* &quot;A coach must train [the players] with simplicity and establish clear rules when building the team. This simplicity can be expressed through the formulation of a strategy with patterns and tactics based on the following principles: never haggle and delay excessively, pass the ball in depth to verticalise as quickly as possible, control the pace of the game, limit risks, mark behind the ball, use on-field tactical communication to help your players, be alert to the [opposing] team&#x27;s weaknesses and strengths
* &quot;The tactics must focus on the pressure to recover the ball and then quickly develop the offensive action&quot;
* Ball possession is not important in itself and sometimes it can be counter-productive &quot;like a person who talks too much&quot;. It is better &quot;to have 0% of the possession and 100% of the goals&quot;.
* Strong emphasis on training the team in set pieces and dead-ball situations
* Instead of looking for space in the wings, as many managers do, it is more effective to look to exploit spaces behind the opposing team&#x27;s backline through quick &quot;vertical play&quot; (). By inviting the opponent&#x27;s pressing, the team can then easily exploit the spaces and gaps behind the opponent&#x27;s defence
* The central area of the pitch, towards which statistically most of the possession is directed, needs to be very well-covered. There, the aim is to cripple the opponent&#x27;s game and prevail on crucial second balls, thus easily creating &quot;vertical and violent offensive transitions&quot;
* Strikers must be trained to become clinical finishers or &quot;killers&quot; in the mould of Paolo Rossi or Filippo Inzaghi
* Tactical discipline is necessary, but the special genius of standout players should also be encouraged and harnessed to the fullest, with Trapattoni citing his use of Michel Platini and Roberto Baggio as primary examples.

== In popular culture ==
Trapattoni is a popular figure in Italy for his original press conference speeches and trademark quotes, one of the most famous being &quot;don&#x27;t say cat until you&#x27;ve got it in the bag&quot;. During his managerial stints abroad, his sense of humour, coupled with his difficulties with the local language, won him a significant amount of popularity with both fans and the press. A press conference which took place on 10 March 1998 while he was in charge of German club Bayern Munich has become known among German fans: in a speech riddled with grammar mistakes and involuntary neologisms, most famously using (German uses the verb [&#x27;to be&#x27;] and not [&#x27;to have&#x27;] to express &#x27;I have finished&#x27;/&#x27;I am done&#x27;) and (&#x27;weak like a bottle empty&#x27;), he soundly attacked many of his players, including Mehmet Scholl, Mario Basler and Thomas Strunz, whose last name sounds like in Trapattoni&#x27;s native Milanese dialect of Lombard, a swear word equivalent to Italian (&#x27;asshole&#x27; or &#x27;piece of shit&#x27;). In a 2011 interview, Trapattoni himself explained his famous outburst thus:

He is also known for the two-fingered whistle he uses to capture the attention of his players during games and for bringing a bottle of holy water during 2002 FIFA World Cup games when he was in charge of the Italy national team. He kept the same tradition while in charge of Benfica.

<doc id="747858" wikidata="Q948598" url="?curid=747858" title="Albert Pinkham Ryder">
<text>Albert Pinkham Ryder (March 19, 1847 – March 28, 1917) was an American painter best known for his poetic and moody allegorical works and seascapes, as well as his eccentric personality. While his art shared an emphasis on subtle variations of color with tonalist works of the time, it was unique for accentuating form in a way that some art historians regard as a precursor to modernism.

== Early life ==
Ryder was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts. New Bedford, a bustling whaling port during the 19th century, had an intimate connection with the sea that probably supplied artistic inspiration for Ryder later in life. He was the youngest of four sons; little else is known of his childhood. He began to paint landscapes while in New Bedford. The Ryder family moved to New York City in 1867 or 1868 to join Ryder&#x27;s elder brother, who had opened a successful restaurant. His brother also managed the Hotel Albert, which became a Greenwich Village landmark. Ryder took his meals at this hostelry for many years, but it was named for the original owner, Albert Rosenbaum, not the painter. Ryder applied to the National Academy of Design but his application got rejected.

== Training and early career ==
The early view of Ryder was that he was a recluse, holding that he developed his style in isolation and without influence from contemporary American or European art, but this view has been contradicted by later scholarship that has revealed his many associations and exposures to other artists. Ryder&#x27;s first training in art was with the painter William Edgar Marshall in New York. From 1870 to 1873, and again from 1874 to 1875, Ryder studied art at the National Academy of Design. He exhibited his first painting there in 1873 and met artist J. Alden Weir, who became his lifelong friend. In 1877, Ryder made the first of four trips to Europe throughout his life, where his studying of the paintings of the French Barbizon school and the Dutch Hague School would have a significant impact on his work. Also in 1877, he became a founding member of the Society of American Artists. The Society was a loosely organized group whose work did not conform to the academic standards of the day, and its members included Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Robert Swain Gifford (also from New Bedford), Ryder&#x27;s friend Julian Alden Weir, John LaFarge, and Alexander Helwig Wyant. Ryder exhibited with this group from 1878 to 1887. His early paintings of the 1870s were often tonalist landscapes, sometimes including cattle, trees and small buildings.

== Artistic maturity ==
The 1880s and 1890s are thought of as Ryder&#x27;s most creative and artistically mature period. During the 1880s, Ryder exhibited frequently and his work was well received by critics. His art became more poetic and imaginative, and Ryder wrote poetry to accompany many of his works. His paintings sometimes depicted scenes from literature, opera, and religion. Ryder&#x27;s signature style is characterized by broad, sometimes ill-defined shapes or stylized figures situated in a dream-like land or seascape. His scenes are often illuminated by dim sunlight or glowing moonlight cast through eerie clouds. The shift in Ryder&#x27;s art from pastoral landscapes to more mystical, enigmatic subjects is believed to have been influenced by Robert Loftin Newman, with whom Ryder shared a studio.

== Later years ==

After 1900, around the time of his father&#x27;s death, Ryder&#x27;s creativity fell dramatically. For the rest of his life he spent his artistic energy on occasionally re-working existing paintings, some of which lay scattered about his New York apartment. Visitors to Ryder&#x27;s home were struck by his slovenly habits—he never cleaned, and his floor was covered with trash, plates with old food, and a thick layer of dust, and he would have to clear space for visitors to stand or sit. He was shy and did not seek the company of others, but received company courteously and enjoyed telling stories or talking about his art. He gained a reputation as a loner, but he maintained social contacts, enjoyed writing letters, and continued to travel on occasion to visit friends.

While Ryder&#x27;s creativity fell after the turn of the century, his fame grew. Important collectors of American art sought Ryder paintings for their holdings and often lent choice examples for national art exhibitions, as Ryder himself had lost interest in actively exhibiting his work. In 1913, ten of his paintings were shown together in the historic Armory Show, an honor reflecting the admiration felt towards Ryder by modernist artists of the time who saw his work as a harbinger of American modernist art.

By 1915 Ryder&#x27;s health deteriorated, and he died on March 28, 1917, at the home of a friend who was caring for him. He was buried at the Rural Cemetery in his birthplace of New Bedford, Massachusetts.

A memorial exhibition of his work was held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1918.

==Work and legacy==

Ryder completed fewer than two hundred paintings, nearly all of which were created before 1900. He rarely signed and never dated his paintings.

While the works of many of Ryder&#x27;s contemporaries were partly or mostly forgotten through much of the 20th century, Ryder&#x27;s artistic reputation has remained largely intact owing to his unique and forward-looking style. Artists whose work was influenced by Ryder include Marsden Hartley, who befriended him, and Jackson Pollock.

Ryder used his materials liberally and with little regard for sound technical procedures. His paintings, which he often worked on for ten years or more, were built up of layers of paint, resin, and varnish applied on top of each other. He would use a wet-on-wet technique, and would often paint into wet varnish, or apply a layer of fast-drying paint over a layer of slow-drying paint. He incorporated unconventional materials, such as candle wax, bitumen, and non-drying oils, into his paintings. By these means, Ryder achieved a luminosity that his contemporaries admired—his works seemed to &quot;glow with an inner radiance, like some minerals&quot;—but the result was short-lived. Paintings by Ryder remain unstable and become much darker over time; they develop wide fissures, do not fully dry even after decades, and sometimes completely disintegrate. Many of Ryder&#x27;s paintings deteriorated significantly even during his lifetime, and he tried to restore them in his later years. Some of his pieces were reworked so many times that they are still soft even a century later. Because of his own restorations, and because some Ryder paintings were completed or reworked by others after his death, many Ryder paintings appear very different today than they did when first created.

=== Forgeries ===
In their book, &quot;Albert Pinkham Ryder: Painter of Dreams&quot;, William Innes Homer and Lloyd Goodrich wrote, &quot;There are more fake Ryders than there are forgeries of any other American artist except his contemporary Ralph Blakelock.&quot; The authors, experts on Ryder, estimate the number of forged works at over one thousand. They also claimed (as of 1989) that some remained in private and museum collections, in addition to being offered through art dealers and auction houses. Part of the reason why so many fake Ryders exist is that his style is easily copied. Forgers can go to great lengths to fabricate the age of a painting, including painting it on antique canvas and baking it to add cracks. Forgeries can be discovered through visual and chemical examination, and through a provable provenance—a collection of written documentation detailing a painting&#x27;s ownership history.

For instance, Ryder&#x27;s piece, &quot;Elegy&quot;, while on loan to the Whitney Museum, was examined by Lloyd Goodrich, then a curator at the Whitney. A layer of consistent brushstrokes was revealed through an x-ray examination, which was uncharacteristic of Ryder&#x27;s often generously layered pieces. It was concluded that &quot;Elegy&quot; was likely painted to be an imitation of &quot;The Lone Horseman&quot;, a genuine Ryder piece.

<doc id="747859" wikidata="Q1750532" url="?curid=747859" title="Yukihiro Takahashi">
<text>was a Japanese musician, singer, record producer, fashion designer, and actor, who was best known internationally as the drummer, lead vocalist, &amp; 2nd keyboardist of the Yellow Magic Orchestra, as the former drummer of the Sadistic Mika Band, and as the drummer &amp; backing vocalist of the Sadistics. He was also a member of the groups: the Beatniks (w/ Keiichi Suzuki), Sketch Show (w/ Haruomi Hosono), &amp; Metafive (w/ Towa Tei etc.).

==Career==
Takahashi first came to prominence as the drummer of the Sadistic Mika Band in the early 1970s, and became known to western audiences after this band (led by Kazuhiko Katō, formerly of The Folk Crusaders) toured and recorded in the United Kingdom. After the Sadistic Mika Band disbanded, some of the members (including Takahashi) formed another band called The Sadistics, who released several albums. Takahashi recorded his first solo album, &quot;Saravah&quot;, in 1977. In 1978, Takahashi joined Ryuichi Sakamoto and Haruomi Hosono to form the Yellow Magic Orchestra.

Throughout the 1980s, Takahashi also released a large number of solo albums primarily intended for the Japanese market. Takahashi collaborated extensively with other musicians, including Bill Nelson, Iva Davies of Icehouse, Keiichi Suzuki of the Moonriders (often as a duo dubbed &quot;The Beatniks&quot;, although Suzuki essentially functioned as a member of Takahashi&#x27;s backing band during the Moonriders&#x27; brief hiatus) and in particular Steve Jansen. Takahashi released a single &quot;Stay Close&quot; and an EP &quot;Pulse&quot; as a duo with Jansen.

Takahashi helped compose the soundtrack to the anime series &quot;&quot; in 1989, including the song &quot;Families&quot;. Takahashi participated in temporary reunions of both the Sadistic Mika Band (minus the lead vocalist Mika, who was replaced by Kaela Kimura), and The Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO). Both of these reunions included tours of Japan and an album of new material.

In the early 2000s, Takahashi became a member of the duo Sketch Show, with Haruomi Hosono. Sketch Show released two albums, one of which, &quot;Loophole&quot;, was released in the UK. Both Takahashi and Hosono reunited with Sakamoto as HASYMO – a combination of Human Audio Sponge and Yellow Magic Orchestra. This collaboration produced a single, &quot;Rescue&quot;, in 2007. Takahashi released the solo album &quot;Life Anew&quot; on July 17, 2013, as well as anniversary and live albums. His later work included &quot;Saravah, Saravah!&quot; (2018), a remastered reboot of his solo debut album which, along with re-recorded vocals, featured appearances by Sakamoto, Hosono and other musicians.

==Personal life==
Takahashi was born in Tokyo, and began playing music from an early age. He was married to Emiko Takahashi (1980-1992) &amp; Kiyomi Takahashi (1993-2023).

===Health and death===
Takahashi suffered from headaches from the beginning of summer 2020. While Takahashi initially thought that these were migraines, he finally underwent an MRI scan. It was discovered that the headaches were the result of a brain tumor. On August 13, 2020, Takahashi underwent surgery to remove the tumor; he announced that there were no after effects and that he would devote himself to treatment. On October 20, 2020, Takahashi announced through his social media that he had completed his course of treatment following the surgery.

On January 11, 2023, Takahashi died in Karuizawa, Nagano, from aspiration pneumonia, a complication of the brain tumor. He was 70.

<doc id="747860" wikidata="Q8008104" url="?curid=747860" title="William Duncan Herridge">
<text>William Duncan Herridge (September 18, 1887 – September 21, 1961) was a Canadian politician and diplomat.

==Early life==
He was the son of Reverend William T. Herridge, DD (1857-1929), a former (1914) moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, and Minister of St. Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church (Ottawa) from 1883 until 1919.

Herridge was educated at Ottawa Collegiate Institute, the University of Toronto, where he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Society, and Osgoode Hall Law School.

He served in the Canadian Expeditionary Force during World War I in which he received a field promotion to the rank of Major and was awarded the Military Cross and the Distinguished Service Order.

==Career==
Herridge was a patent attorney by profession and had been a Liberal Party supporter but, being a personal friend of Governor General Byng, he broke with the Liberals in 1926 over the King-Byng Affair. He joined R.B. Bennett&#x27;s 1930 federal election campaign acting as speechwriter and policy advisor to the Conservative leader. When the Tories took power, he was appointed Canada&#x27;s envoy to the United States with the title Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary for Canada in the United States of America, from 1931 to 1935, succeeding his friend, Vincent Massey. In 1931, he married Bennett&#x27;s sister, Mildred. She died in New York City in May 1938, leaving a young son, William Robert Bennett Herridge (1932-2024). His first wife was Rose Fleck (1887-1925), granddaughter of Ottawa River lumber and railroad tycoon John Rudolphus Booth.

While stationed in Washington, D.C., Herridge was impressed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal, and convinced Bennett to attempt to adopt similar policies in Canada for combatting the Great Depression. Bennett&#x27;s turn towards reform occurred too late in his term, however, and his government was soundly defeated in the 1935 election.

Herridge returned to Canada and was a delegate to the 1938 National Conservative Party Convention and raised hackles when he made an attack on a policy resolution that endorsed orthodox finance policy, rejecting the New Deal policies advocated by Bennett and Herridge in the last days of Bennett&#x27;s government. He dismissed the resolution as &quot;little more than junk&quot; and &quot;the supreme accomplishment of reaction within this party.&quot; Herridge warns that unless the party adopted a reform program it would die and lamented the loss of his brother-in-law as party leader due to &quot;the powers of reaction, and the stirring up of racial and religious strife.&quot; Herridge&#x27;s comments were not well received and elicited a round of boos and jeers of &quot;go back to the States&quot; and &quot;Jeremiah&quot; from the delegates and his amendments were rejected.

==New Democracy Party==
His ideas rejected by the Conservative Party, Herridge, in 1939, launched the New Democracy party, which advocated monetary reform and government intervention in the economy. The party&#x27;s positions were similar to those of the Social Credit Party of Canada. The two parties ran a joint slate in the 1940 election under the New Democracy banner with Herridge as the lead candidate. Herridge, however, came in third in the riding of Kindersley, Saskatchewan with 30% of the vote and thus failed to win a seat in the House of Commons of Canada. The only New Democracy Members of Parliament elected were those who had been elected to parliament for the Social Credit Party. After the election, the New Democracy party folded, and its MPs reverted to their previous identity as Social Credit members.

<doc id="747862" wikidata="Q3430866" url="?curid=747862" title="Richard Hill (rugby union, born 1973)">
<text>Richard Anthony Hill (born 23 May 1973) is a former rugby union footballer who played as a flanker for Saracens and England.

Often portrayed as the &#x27;silent assassin&#x27; at both club and international level, Hill was renowned for his effective and abrasive style of forward play. Big hits, shrewd driving and energy-sapping support play, were features of his exceptionally well-rounded game which made him one of the most highly rated flankers of his era.

He has a namesake, Richard John Hill, who played for England at scrum half between 1984 and 1992.

==Early life==
He was born on 23 May 1973 in Dormansland, Surrey.

On his mother&#x27;s side, Hill is a second cousin removed of film director Peter Jackson (Richard Hill&#x27;s maternal grandmother and Peter Jackson&#x27;s mother are first cousins both by father&#x27;s side). His nephew is left back, Ben Purrington.

Hill attended Bishop Wordsworth&#x27;s Grammar School in Salisbury, and gained early prominence as a schools international. It is coincidental that his namesake, who coaches Bristol, had also attended the same school and both played for Salisbury Rugby Club. Hill graduated from the West London Institute of Higher Education in Sports Science and Geography, in 1995. He also won the IB Mac prize in recognition of his combined academic and athletic achievements. On 16 July 2002, Brunel University conferred upon Hill the honorary degree of Master of the University.

==Playing career==

===Early years===
He made his first Saracens appearance in 1993.

Hill made his England debut in the 1997 Five Nations Championship against Scotland, playing at openside flanker. He was selected ahead of Neil Back, who was controversially ignored by the England team for that period. He toured South Africa with the British Lions in the summer of 1997, gaining two caps.

He missed Saracens&#x27; Tetley&#x27;s Bitter Cup victory in 1998 with a back injury.

Under new coach Clive Woodward, Hill was initially selected at openside, but was moved to blindside flanker to accommodate Neil Back on the openside flank, Lawrence Dallaglio moving from blindside to number eight. It was in this position, with this Hill, Back, Dallaglio combination of players, that Hill gained most of his caps.

===2003 Rugby World Cup===
Although Hill had been named in England&#x27;s 2003 Rugby World Cup squad, his place appeared in jeopardy after he suffered a hamstring strain on the eve of the tournament. Coach Clive Woodward decided that it was worth the risk to keep Hill in the team.

Hill missed the pool games, and days out from England&#x27;s quarterfinal clash with Wales, scans on the injured hamstring initially revealed grim prospects, but Hill was encouraged by the team physios that it was still possible to recover in time for the semi-final.

England saw off a brave challenge from Wales in the quarterfinal to advance to the semi-finals. Hill was named in the starting line up for the semi-final against France. England easily coped with the much-vaunted French back-row. Hill played a key role in helping England defeat Australia in the final.

===Later years===
Since Neil Back&#x27;s retirement in 2003, Hill switched back to the openside flanker role. He is the only player never to have been dropped during Sir Clive Woodward&#x27;s England tenure, due to his prolific work in the rucks and mauls. He played for Saracens and was selected for the England Saxons (A-Team) squad for the 2007 internationals.

Hill injured the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in a match against London Irish on 3 October 2004, and underwent surgery three days later. He was out for the following seven months, but returned to be named in a Lions touring squad for the third time in 2005. He was named in the starting fifteen for the first Lions Test against the All Blacks, but suffered a knee injury during the first half, ending his tour.

In January 2008 Hill announced that he would retire at the end of the current Guinness Premiership season, due to the toll taken upon his knee since his two injuries, which had left him with a permanent limp. However, in April 2008, his man-of-the-match performance in the Heineken Cup victory over Ospreys confirmed his continued ability to perform at the highest level.

On 11 May 2008, Hill played his final game for Saracens, who won 25–20 against Bristol. On 20 September 2008, Hill appeared for the Help for Heroes XV in a charity match against Scott Gibbs&#x27; International XV at Twickenham Stadium to raise funds for injured servicemen and women. He scored a try in the Heroes&#x27; 29–10 win.

In 2019, Hill was appointed Team Manager of the England Rugby Team, having previously served in a similar role with the England Saxons.

<text>Vincent François Damphousse (born December 17, 1967) is a Canadian former professional hockey player who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for eighteen seasons. He played centre for the Toronto Maple Leafs, Edmonton Oilers, Montreal Canadiens, and San Jose Sharks, winning a Stanley Cup championship with Montreal in 1993.

Damphousse is a hockey analyst with the French language television network RDS in his native Quebec.

==Playing career==
Damphousse was drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs 6th overall in the 1986 NHL Entry Draft after a standout junior hockey career with the Laval Voisins/Titan. In 1991 he was named MVP of the NHL All Star Game, being one of only four players (at that time) to ever score 4 goals in a single All-Star matchup. Damphousse spent five seasons in Toronto before being traded to the Edmonton Oilers in 1991 in a deal which sent future Hall of Famers Grant Fuhr and Glenn Anderson to Toronto, while Edmonton received Damphousse, Peter Ing, Luke Richardson, Scott Thornton, cash, and future considerations in return. Oilers&#x27; general manager Glen Sather said of Damphousse at that time that among French-Canadian players, only Mario Lemieux was more skilled offensively.

On August 27, 1992, Damphousse was dealt to his hometown team, the Montreal Canadiens (with a 4th round pick in the 1993 NHL entry draft), in exchange for Shayne Corson, Brent Gilchrist and Vladimir Vujtek. His success with Montreal was immediate, as he recorded 97 points during the regular season and helped the team win the Stanley Cup in 1993. He spent six more seasons in Montreal before being traded on March 23, 1999 to the San Jose Sharks for a first, a second and a fifth round picks. He signed with the Colorado Avalanche on August 19, 2004, but he never played for them, as the 2004–05 NHL season was canceled due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout.

Damphousse was a member of the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA) executive committee, serving as vice president under Trevor Linden.

==Retirement==
Damphousse announced his retirement on September 7, 2005. He currently lives in Montreal and serves as a hockey analyst with the French-language television network RDS.

==Personal==
On April 14, 2011, Damphousse was charged by Montreal police with six counts of assaulting his spouse after allegations made by his wife. The incidents were alleged to have occurred between January 2008 and early 2011. Damphousse categorically denied the allegations brought against him and also filed a complaint against his wife for assault. On June 19, 2013, the Crown dropped all charges against the ex-hockey player, though the Crown announced intentions to pursue its case against Allana Henderson, now Damphousse&#x27;s ex-wife, for armed assault and theft under $5,000. Henderson was accused of committing assault with her vehicle and stealing a briefcase from her ex-husband. On January 14, 2015, the Crown dropped all charges against Henderson.

<doc id="747873" wikidata="Q3430868" url="?curid=747873" title="Richard Hill (rugby union, born 1961)">
<text>Richard Hill (born 4 May 1961 in Birmingham) is a rugby union coach and former English international rugby footballer.

==Biography==
Born in Birmingham, Hill was educated at Bishop Wordsworth&#x27;s Grammar School in Salisbury, and Exeter University. Incidentally his namesake, Richard Hill MBE, who was in the England team to win the Rugby World Cup in 2003 also attended Bishop Wordsworth&#x27;s School and both played for Salisbury Rugby Football Club.

=== Early successes at Schools Level===

One of Richard&#x27;s early successes in 1980 was winning the Wiltshire Schools U18 Sevens tournament with Salisbury&#x27;s Boys Grammar school Bishop Wordsworth&#x27;s defeating Swindon&#x27;s St. Joseph&#x27;s Comprehensive Roman Catholic School in a hard fought final at the Headlands School in Wiltshire. The Salisbury school won by two tries to one. Unfortunately for the Swindon school Bishop Wordsworth were also able to field David Egerton who was also capped by England on 9 occasions.

===Playing career===
Joining Bath Rugby as a scrum-half straight from university, in these amateur times his day job was working for Lloyds Bank. Unlike his half-back partner Stuart Barnes, Hill loved training. Nicknamed &quot;Duracell&quot;, he spent all his available time there, and his dedication spelled the inevitable introduction of the professional era. In 1984 he debuted for England as scrum half against South Africa in Port Elizabeth on the controversial tour. In the 1987 season, he was made captain of England, losing the captaincy after the England-Wales match.

In the autumn of 1990, he rejoined the England squad and went on to play 20 consecutive games until his retirement. Richard was a major component in England&#x27;s excellent form in the first three matches of the 1990 Five Nations campaign and he often provided the ammunition for the likes of Guscott, Carling and Underwood. He even managed to score his first try for England when he touched down against Wales. His final cap was in the 1991 World Cup Final against Australia.

===Coaching career===
After assistant posts at Gloucester and Harlequins, Hill also spent a season as head coach of England Students and the backs coach as Ebbw Vale RFC. In 2002 he was appointed head coach of Newport RFC. A year later he joined Bristol Rugby, leading them back to the Guinness Premiership after two seasons, and then to third place and the playoffs in the 2006–7 season. In July 2009, he agreed to join French third division side Chalon-sur-Saône as head coach.

In May 2010, Hill was named as head coach for Worcester Warriors.
Richard Hill in his first year as head coach, coached the Worcester Warriors back into the Aviva Premiership and held a contract at the Warriors until 2014.

On 16 April 2013, Hill was sacked from his post at Worcester &quot;following the club&#x27;s recent run of form&quot;.

Hill, a fluent French speaker, moved to France to continue his coaching career where he was hired as General Manager in 2013 of Rouen, where he led them to the French Amateur Championship of France. Hill is committed to Rouen until 2023.

<text>The Microcassette (often written generically as microcassette) is an audio storage medium, introduced by Olympus in 1969. 

It has the same width of magnetic tape as the Compact Cassette but in a cassette roughly one quarter the size. By using thinner tape and half or a quarter the tape speed, microcassettes can offer comparable recording time to the compact cassette but in a smaller package.

==History==


Microcassettes have mostly been used for recording voice. In particular, they are commonly used in dictation machines and answering machines. Microcassettes have also been used in computer data storage and to record music. For the latter purpose, devices for recording in stereo were produced in 1982 and, for higher fidelity, microcassettes using Type IV (&quot;metal&quot;, i.e. coated with pure metal particles rather than oxide) tape were sold. This was an attempt by Olympus to cash in on the burgeoning Walkman market; one model, the Olympus SR-11, had a built-in radio and offered a stereo tie-clip microphone as an accessory, which made the unit somewhat popular with concert-goers who wanted to record the concerts they attended without drawing attention to themselves with larger, bulkier full-sized cassette recorders. 

Both of these &quot;high-fidelity&quot; microcassette recorders and the special Type IV blanks they required were relatively expensive and of limited availability, so the system was not widely adopted and Olympus phased them out after two years on the market. (Battery life also was a problem, because the high bias currents required by Type IV tape, combined with the state of battery technology at the time, meant that brand-new alkaline batteries might give out in two hours when the unit was in recording mode.) &quot;Standard&quot; microcassettes are still used in the underground-music circuits for recording and distributing experimental music and field recordings/sound collage, mostly because of their lo-fi qualities. As of August 2021, Ohm Electric still produces microcassette tapes.

==Specifications==
The original standard microcassette, the MC60, gives 30 minutes recording per side at its standard speed of 2.4 cm/s, and double that duration at 1.2 cm/s; an MC90, giving 45 minutes per side @ 2.4 cm/s, is also available from a few manufacturers. Unlike the Compact Cassette, a choice of recording speeds was provided on the original recorders and many others; the tape also spools in the opposite direction, from right to left. For transcription purposes, continuously variable speed was provided on many players. Microcassettes equalisation time constant: Type I (Ferric) at 200μs and Type IV (Metal) at 120μs.

==Competitors==
The microcassette was beaten to market by the Mini-Cassette, introduced by Philips in 1967. The mini-cassette is almost identical in appearance and dimensions to the microcassette, however it has thicker cogs for its reels and a slightly wider cassette. The mini-cassette, despite making it to market first, was less successful than the microcassette. 

A couple of products were created to compete with the microcassette. Dictaphone and JVC introduced the picocassette in 1985, which is half the size of the microcassette. In 1992, Sony released the NT memo recording system, which employs a small cassette for digital recording.

<doc id="747882" wikidata="Q7883569" url="?curid=747882" title="Underdogs (album)">
<text>Underdogs is the second full-length studio album by the Canadian alternative rock group Matthew Good Band, released in 1997. The album was nominated for &quot;Best Rock Album&quot; at the 1999 Juno Awards. In a 2000 poll by music magazine &quot;Chart&quot;, &quot;Underdogs&quot; was voted the 18th Greatest Canadian album of all time.

==Background==
In December 1996, Matthew Good Band signed a two-album deal with Private Music. In mid-January, on the first day of pre-production for &quot;Underdogs&quot;, the group was notified that BMG Entertainment North America was merging Private Music into Windham Hill/High Street Records, putting a halt to the production of the album. In mid-March, after negotiations, Windham Hill/High Street released the group from its contract. Good was paid what he was owed for the two albums, and the group decided to record the new album regardless of label support, using the money received from the divorce of their contract with Windham Hill/High Street to fund it. According to Good, the album cost $100,000 to produce. The group then agreed to release the album under a distribution agreement with PolyGram Group Canada.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Underdogs&quot; was the band&#x27;s most successful album yet. The album was among the top 80 best-selling albums in Canada of 1998, ranking at #76. The album was certified Platinum in Canada in 1999. By March 2003, the album had sold 200,000 units in Canada, achieving Double Platinum status.

<doc id="747891" wikidata="Q377417" url="?curid=747891" title="Roger B. Wilson">
<text>Roger Byron Wilson (born October 10, 1948) is an American politician who served as the 44th lieutenant governor of Missouri from January 1993 to October 2000 and as the 52nd governor of Missouri from October 2000 to January 2001. Wilson was serving his second four-year term as lieutenant governor and was preparing to retire from elected public service when Governor Mel Carnahan died in a plane crash on October 16, 2000. Wilson first became acting governor and was sworn in as governor when Carnahan’s death was confirmed.

After leaving the governor’s office, Wilson was elected by fellow Democrats to serve as Missouri Democratic Party chair.

== Early life and education ==
Wilson was born in Boone County, Missouri. His family was prominent in local politics. His father Roger Woodrow Wilson served as Boone County recorder for four years and then served Boone County Collector for 26 years until his death in 1976. His grandfather Roger Isaac Wilson served as the Boone County sheriff, being killed in a shootout with bank robbers in 1933. His maternal grandfather, Ned Gibbs was also in politics, serving as Boone County recorder. He attended college at Central Methodist College and graduated class of 1977. He was a school teacher and an elementary school principal at Russell Boulevard Elementary School in Columbia, Missouri.

== Political career ==
Wilson began his political career as Boone County Collector in 1976, succeeding his late father. He was elected to the Missouri State Senate from the 19th District in a 1979 special election and was re-elected by large majorities in 1980, 1984, and 1988. During his tenure, Wilson would become chair of the Appropriations Committee. In 1992, he ran for Lieutenant Governor of Missouri, and won by a plurality against State Auditor Margaret B. Kelly. He would win a second term in 1996.

=== Lieutenant Governor ===
Wilson&#x27;s term lasted from 1993 to 2000. During his tenure, voters ratified legislation which expanded the role of Lieutenant Governor, a role once derided for its uselessness. As a result, Wilson served on numerous state boards, such as the Missouri Housing Development Commission, chairing the Missouri Tourism Commission, and being a co-chair of the Missouri Commission on Management and Productivity. In 1995, Wilson served as the tie breaking vote, defeating a provision that would have enabled a referendum on concealed carry. The move proved controversial among opponents of concealed carry and Governor Carnahan. Wilson served as acting governor on numerous occasions, such as in 1997, when for a few weeks, Governor Carnahan was away overseas on a trade mission in Southeast Asia.

=== Governor of Missouri ===
Wilson initially was seen as a strong potential candidate to run for Governor in 2000. However, owing to being significantly outraised by State Treasurer Bob Holden, and wanting to spend more time with his family, Wilson opted not run for Governor. A year later, he declined to run for re-election to Lt. Governor.

In October 2000, on his way to a campaign event for U.S. Senate, Governor Mel Carnahan died in an airplane crash. Wilson, who was in St. Louis preparing for an event the next day, was immediately rushed back to the state&#x27;s capital by state police to serve as acting governor. He was officially sworn in as Governor two days later after Carnahan&#x27;s death was confirmed by authorities. Wilson served as governor until the end of Carnahan&#x27;s unfinished term in 2001. Following Governor Carnahan&#x27;s posthumous election to the U.S. Senate, Wilson appointed his widow Jean Carnahan to serve in his place.

=== Chairman of the Missouri Democratic Party ===
In August 2004, Wilson became Chairman of the Missouri Democratic Party and endorsed Claire McCaskill in her bid to unseat incumbent Governor Bob Holden in the Democratic Primary. McCaskill won the primary, but lost the general election to Republican Matt Blunt. In January 2007, Wilson announced he would not seek an additional term as Democratic Chairman.

== Subsequent career ==
On April 12, 2012, Wilson pleaded guilty to federal charges of money laundering. Wilson had improperly donated money to the Missouri Democratic Party and billed the public entity Missouri Employers Mutual for legal fees to cover it up. Wilson pled guilty and was fined $2,000 by the Missouri Ethics Commission. In July he was sentenced to two years of probation on the money laundering charge.

Wilson was also ousted as President and CEO of Missouri Employers Mutual in Columbia, Missouri in June 2011.

<doc id="747893" wikidata="Q1109956" url="?curid=747893" title="Dominick Napolitano">
<text>Dominick Napolitano (June 16, 1930 – August 17, 1981), also known as Sonny Black, was an American Mafia caporegime in the Bonanno crime family. He is known for unwittingly allowing FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone to become an associate in his crew and nearly having him become a &quot;made man.&quot;

== Early life ==

Napolitano&#x27;s grandparents were immigrants from Naples, Italy. Napolitano was born with blond hair, but by his forties it had turned a gunmetal white-silver color. To hide the color, he dyed it black, earning him the nickname &quot;Sonny Black&quot;. 

He was a close friend of future Bonanno crime family boss Joseph Massino; incarcerated boss Philip Rastelli knew Napolitano before he went to prison. He was close to Carmine Napolitano (May 30, 1943 – February 15, 1999), a cousin and fellow Bonanno mobster. Like his sons Peter Napolitano (November 17, 1957 – June 29, 1994), Aniello Napolitano and Rocco Napolitano who were born and raised in Williamsburg, Brooklyn; he was also raised there.

Napolitano controlled Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and from 1979–80, he operated in Pasco County, Florida, and from Holiday, Florida, after negotiating control of the territory with Santo Trafficante, Jr. At that time, Napolitano set his sights on operating a major bookmaking operation in Orlando.

== Caporegime ==

Napolitano rose to prominence in 1973 as a soldier for Michael Sabella and was promoted to capo, replacing his mentor after the gangland execution of the powerful rival capo Carmine &quot;The Cigar&quot; Galante. Sabella was demoted and Napolitano took over the crew. He became a trusted confidant of the imprisoned mobster Phillip &quot;Rusty&quot; Rastelli who took over leadership permanently again. But when Rastelli took over, it caused the Bonannos to split into two factions, one loyal to Rastelli, the other attempting to overthrow him in favor of the Sicilian faction, led by Alphonse &quot;Sonny Red&quot; Indelicato. 

Napolitano owned the Wither&#x27;s Italian-American Veterans of Foreign Wars Club at 415 Graham Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and also The Motion Lounge at 420 Graham Avenue. He later ran an illegal casino in Pasco County, Florida, and owned a tennis club and night club called &quot;The King&#x27;s Court Bottle Club&quot; in Holiday, Florida.

Napolitano&#x27;s headquarters were in the heart of Williamsburg&#x27;s Italian neighborhood. His crew, involved in burglary, extortion, robbery, bank robbery, loansharking, hijacking, bookmaking, casino operations and drug trafficking, were one of the most successful crews in the Bonanno family. Napolitano&#x27;s crew included Bonanno street soldiers Benjamin &quot;Lefty&quot; Ruggiero, Nicholas Santora, Louis Attanasio, John Cersani, Jerome Asaro, Anthony Francomano, Sandro Asaro, John Faraci, Daniel Mangelli, Robert Lino, Frank Lino, Richard Riccardi, Joseph Grimaldi, Nicholas Accardi, Peter Rosa, Patrick DeFilippo, Michael Mancuso, Vito Grimaldi, Anthony Urso, James Tartaglione, Joseph Cammarano, John Zancocchio, Edward Barberra, Frankie Fish, Bobby Badheart, Bobby Smash and his previous capo Michael Sabella, Joseph Puma, Steven Maruca, Salvatore Farrugia, Anthony Pesiri, Antonio Tomasulo, Anthony Rabito, Raymond Wean, Frank DiStefano, Salvatore D&#x27;Ottavio, James Episcopa and Donnie Brasco.

== Operation Donnie Brasco ==
Napolitano assigned associate Donnie Brasco in September 1981, whom he hoped to make a made man, to kill Bruno Indelicato, who had previously evaded death when he missed the meeting when the three capos were killed in May 1981. &quot;Brasco&quot;, however, was an undercover FBI agent named Joseph Pistone; shortly after the hit was ordered, Pistone&#x27;s assignment was ended, and Napolitano was informed of their infiltration. 

In 1981, Napolitano and Joseph Massino, who were loyal to Rastelli, were chiefly responsible for helping to end the struggle by killing three capos opposed to Rastelli: Alphonse Indelicato, Dominick Trinchera and Philip Giaccone. Already skeptical of Napolitano&#x27;s support of &quot;Brasco&quot;, Massino was deeply disturbed by the breach of security when he learned of the agent&#x27;s true identity. Salvatore Vitale would later testify that this was the reason Massino decided to murder Napolitano as well; as he would later quote Massino, &quot;I have to give him a receipt for the Donnie Brasco situation.&quot;

== Death ==
On August 17, 1981, Napolitano was summoned to a meeting in Bonanno associate Ron Filocomo&#x27;s home in Eltingville, Staten Island, which was the home of Filocomo&#x27;s parents. Anticipating that he would be killed, Napolitano gave his jewelry to his favorite bartender, who worked below his apartment at the Motion Lounge, along with the keys to his apartment so that his pet pigeons could be cared for. 

Bonanno capo Frank Lino and Steven Canone drove Napolitano to the Filocomo&#x27;s house. The three men were greeted at the door by Frank Coppa, who told them the conference was to be held in the basement. As Napolitano descended the basement stairs, Coppa slammed the basement door shut, signaling for Lino to shove Napolitano down the stairs, as two killers; Robert Lino Sr (Frank Lino&#x27;s cousin) and Filocomo were waiting at the foot of the stairwell. Napolitano was pushed down the staircase and was shot and grazed by Lino Sr. When his gun failed to fire a subsequent shot, Napolitano told them &quot;Hit me one more time and make it good&quot;, to which Filocomo responded by firing several .38 caliber rounds, killing him.

Napolitano&#x27;s girlfriend, Judy, later contacted Pistone and told him that, shortly before his death, Napolitano had told her that he bore no ill will towards Pistone, knowing that Pistone was only doing his job, and that if anyone was responsible for taking him down, he was glad it was Pistone. She said that Napolitano really loved Pistone and was upset when he found out he was an agent. Napolitano could not believe that Pistone was an agent because of the &quot;things we had done together, the conversations we&#x27;d had, the feelings we&#x27;d had.&quot;

In August, FBI surveillance noticed workmen dismantling Napolitano&#x27;s pigeon coops atop the Motion Lounge. On August 12, 1982, a body was found at South Avenue and Bridge Street in Arlington, Staten Island; the corpse&#x27;s hands were severed and the face was so badly decomposed that dental records were required to verify the identity. The FBI announced that it had found the corpse of Napolitano.

In 2003, Bonanno boss Joseph Massino was arrested and charged with a variety of crimes, with the case centering on the murder of Napolitano. At Massino&#x27;s trial, prosecutors claimed that Napolitano was killed by his associates for allowing his crew to be compromised, and that his hands had been removed as a warning to other mobsters to follow the rule about proper introductions (the implication being the association between shaking hands and being introduced to someone). Massino was convicted in 2004 and sentenced to life imprisonment.

In 2006, Frank Lino and Frank Coppa became informants, providing authorities with the details of Napolitano&#x27;s murder. Although the FBI were reasonably sure that the body found in Staten Island was Napolitano&#x27;s, one discrepancy existed: Lino claimed that he and Filocomo shot Napolitano with .38 caliber revolvers and that he himself had fired more than once. But the corpse had only one bullet wound, apparently made by a .45 caliber pistol. Coppa later said that Napolitano &quot;died like a man&quot;. Napolitano was buried in Calvary Cemetery, Queens. About Napolitano&#x27;s fate, Pistone had stated, &quot;My intention in all of this was to put people in jail, not get them killed&quot;, and that he was sorry for Napolitano&#x27;s murder.

<text>Ravenloft is an adventure module for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;) fantasy role-playing game. The American game publishing company TSR, Inc. released it as a standalone adventure booklet in 1983 for use with the first edition &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game. It was written by Tracy and Laura Hickman, and includes art by Clyde Caldwell with maps by David Sutherland III. The plot of &quot;Ravenloft&quot; focuses on the villain Strahd von Zarovich, a vampire who pines for his lost love. Various story elements, including Strahd&#x27;s motivation and the locations of magical weapons, are randomly determined by drawing cards. The player characters attempt to defeat Strahd and, if successful, the adventure ends.

The Hickmans began work on &quot;Ravenloft&quot; in the late 1970s, intent on creating a frightening portrait of a vampire in a setting that combined Gothic horror with the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game system. They play-tested the adventure with a group of players each Halloween for five years before it was published. Strahd has since appeared in a number of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; accessories and novels. The module has inspired numerous revisions and adaptations, including a campaign setting of the same name and a sequel. In 1999, on the 25th anniversary of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, two commemorative versions of &quot;Ravenloft&quot; were released.

&quot;Ravenloft&quot; has won one award, been included on two &quot;best of&quot; lists, and was generally well received by critics of its era. In 1984, it won the Strategists&#x27; Club Award for Outstanding Play Aid, and it appeared second in &quot;Dungeon&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the top 30 &quot;D&amp;D&quot; adventures. Several reviewers liked the included maps, and &quot;White Dwarf&quot; magazine gave it 8 out of 10 overall. A &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine review praised the module, but felt that the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; elements detracted from the Gothic horror atmosphere. In 2016, Wizards of the Coast published &quot;Curse of Strahd&quot;, an adaptation of the original &quot;Ravenloft&quot; module for the 5th edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons.&quot;

==Plot==
The story involves a party of player characters (PCs) who travel to the land of Barovia, a small nation surrounded by a deadly magical fog. The master of nearby Castle Ravenloft, Count Strahd von Zarovich, tyrannically rules the country, and a prologue explains that the residents must barricade their doors each night to avoid attacks by Strahd and his minions. The Burgomaster&#x27;s mansion is the focus of these attacks, and, for reasons that are not initially explained, Strahd is after the Burgomaster&#x27;s adopted daughter, Ireena Kolyana.

Before play begins, the Dungeon Master (or DM, the player who organizes and directs the game play) randomly draws five cards from a deck of six. Two of these cards determine the locations of two magical weapons useful in defeating Strahd: the Holy Symbol and the Sunsword. The next two cards determine the locations of Strahd and the &quot;Tome of Strahd&quot;, a book that details Strahd&#x27;s long-ago unrequited love. In this work, it is revealed that Strahd had fallen in love with a young girl, who in turn loved his younger brother. Strahd blamed his age for the rejection, and made a pact with evil powers to live forever. He then slew his brother, but the young girl killed herself in response, and Strahd found that he had become a vampire. All possible locations are inside Castle Ravenloft.

The fifth and final card selected determines Strahd&#x27;s motivation. There are four possible motivations for Strahd. He may want to replace one of the PCs and attempt to turn the character into a vampire and take on that character&#x27;s form. He may desire the love of Ireena, whose appearance matches that of his lost love, Tatyana. Using mind control, Strahd will try to force a PC to attack Ireena and gain her love by &quot;saving&quot; her from the situation he created. Strahd may also want to create an evil magic item, or destroy the Sunsword. If, during play, the party&#x27;s fortune is told at the gypsy camp in Barovia, the random elements are altered to match the cards drawn by the gypsy.

As the party journeys through Barovia and the castle, the game play is guided using 12 maps with corresponding sections in the book&#x27;s body guide. Example maps and sections include the Lands of Barovia, the Court of the Count, five entries for each level of the Spires of Ravenloft, and the Dungeons and Catacombs. Each location contains treasure and adversaries, including zombies, wolves, ghouls, ghosts, and other creatures. The main objective of the game is to destroy Count Strahd. The DM is instructed to play the vampire intelligently, and to keep him alive as long as possible, making him flee when necessary. In an optional epilogue, Ireena is reunited with her lover. They leave the &quot;mortal world&quot; as Ireena says, &quot;Through these many centuries we have played out the tragedy of our lives.&quot;

==Publication background==
Tracy Hickman and Laura Curtis married in 1977. Soon after, while living in Provo, Utah, they wrote the adventures &quot;Pharaoh&quot; and &quot;Ravenloft&quot;. When they began work on &quot;Ravenloft&quot;, they felt the vampire archetype had become overused, trite, and mundane, and decided to create a frightening version of the creature for the module. &quot;Ravenloft&quot; was inspired by Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; and advertised as &quot;a classic gothic story.&quot; They play-tested it with a group of players every Halloween for five years before it was published in 1983 by TSR. The plot combined elements of the horror genre with &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; conventions for the first time. At the time of &quot;Ravenloft&quot;&#x27;s release, each &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; module was marked with an alphanumeric code indicating the series to which it belonged. &quot;Ravenloft&quot; was labeled I6: the sixth in a series of intermediate-level modules for the first edition of &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;AD&amp;D&quot;). It consisted of a 32-page book, with separate maps that detailed locations in the adventure scenario.

Tracy Hickman once ran the adventure as a Dungeon Master. According to him, the experience was like an old scary movie, with &quot;the obligatory castle high on the craggy cliff with the wolves howling in the woods. Sure enough, the vampire was up there in the castle. To most of the players it seemed like a straight forward task: find the vampire and kill him.&quot; One player discovered Strahd&#x27;s backstory and was so affected by it that when it came time to kill the vampire at the end of the adventure, despite having a sword capable of dispatching Strahd, he refused, and his companions were forced to complete the task. Afterwards, Hickman asked him why. &quot;He deserved to die better than that,&quot; his friend said, to which Hickman replied &quot;Yes [...] But that is how it is with people who fall from greatness. He chose his end when he first chose to kill his brother. How could it be any different?&quot;.

According to a Wizards of the Coast article, Strahd has become one of the most infamous and well-known villains in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game, and he has appeared in a number of novels and rulebooks since his debut in &quot;Ravenloft&quot;. In an introduction to an online edition of &quot;Ravenloft II&quot;, author John D. Rateliff described Strahd as a then-unusual fusion of a monster with the abilities of a player character class; that is, a vampire magic-user. This design enables him to combine his own powers with the surrounding environment, making him a difficult opponent to defeat.

To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game in 1999, two additional versions of the &quot;Ravenloft&quot; module were released. The first was a reprinting of the original adventure made available in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Silver Anniversary Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; boxed set, with slight modifications to make it distinguishable from the original (for collecting purposes). The second was the silver anniversary edition of &quot;Ravenloft&quot; that was adapted for use with the second edition &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (Wizards of the Coast periodically alters the rules of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and releases a new version).

===&quot;Ravenloft II: The House on Gryphon Hill&quot;===

&quot;Ravenloft&#x27;s&quot; success led to a sequel in 1986 titled &quot;Ravenloft II: The House on Gryphon Hill&quot;. Although Tracy Hickman was credited in &quot;Ravenloft II&quot;, he had left TSR before the module was completed. The writing was done by David &quot;Zeb&quot; Cook, Jeff Grubb, Harold Johnson, and Douglas Niles, following the Hickmans&#x27; outline. Each writer pursued a different section of the module in order to meet the deadline. Clyde Caldwell, who had done all of the art for the original &quot;Ravenloft&quot; module, provided the cover, but interior art was done by Jeff Easley. The adventure is designed for first edition &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; characters of levels 8–10. The adventure was 48 pages, and included a large color map and an outer folder. It shared structural elements with the original, including variable NPC goals and variable locations for key objects, so that &quot;Gryphon Hill&quot; plays differently each time. The module&#x27;s plot features an artifact known as &quot;The Apparatus&quot; that switches a monster&#x27;s personality with that of an ordinary townsperson; player characters, therefore, are uncertain about the true identity of the people they meet. The module also introduces Azalin the lich, who later became a major character in the Ravenloft campaign setting. This module is playable alone, or as a sequel to the original &quot;Ravenloft&quot;. The module describes the town of Mordentshire, as well as some haunted moors, and a manor house, all of which are mapped in perspective like the original module.

===Adaptations===
In 1986, &quot;Ravenloft&quot; was adapted into the gamebook &quot;Master of Ravenloft&quot;, #6 in the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons Adventure Gamebooks&quot; series. In the book, the reader plays the role of Jeren Sureblade, a paladin, who must defeat Count Strahd von Zarovich to save a young girl from becoming one of the undead. The gamebook was written by Jean Blashfield, with cover art by Clyde Caldwell and interior art by Gary Williams.

&quot;Ravenloft&quot; inspired a campaign setting of the same name, published in 1990. The &quot;&quot; boxed set was published as part of the second edition of &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and, according to its back cover, it is &quot;rooted in the Gothic tradition&quot; and contains &quot;tips for adding fear to your games&quot;. The setting of the module was expanded; Ravenloft is now a demiplane (an alternate dimension). The boxed set&#x27;s version of Strahd is similar to character in the original adventure, but his abilities were increased and his background explained in more detail. The campaign setting has produced a number of spin-offs, and this new version of Strahd was used as a major character in a number of novels.

The original &quot;Ravenloft&quot; module has been revised and expanded multiple times. In 1993, TSR published &quot;House of Strahd&quot; (module code RM4). It was updated to include rules from the second edition of &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. The module credits the original work by the Hickmans, but was revised by Bruce Nesmith, who along with Andria Hayday created the &quot;Ravenloft&quot; campaign setting. Nesmith introduced new monsters, made further developments on Strahd&#x27;s tactics, and added a Time-Track Table to help the Dungeon Master plan for the sunset. In October 2006, Wizards of the Coast released an updated and expanded version of the original module for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; version 3.5 as a 226-page hardcover book entitled &quot;Expedition to Castle Ravenloft&quot;. It was based on the original module, and not the &quot;Ravenloft&quot; material made in the intervening years. &quot;Expedition to Castle Ravenloft&quot; is designed to be played as a mini-campaign lasting about 20 game sessions, much longer than the original module, although it contains options for running long 8-session or short 4-session adventures. The book also includes suggestions for incorporating the adventure into an existing generic setting, Forgotten Realms, Eberron or d20 Modern campaign. Wizards of the Coast released the board game &quot;Castle Ravenloft&quot; in 2010 as part of the &quot;Adventure System&quot; series of board games using a simplified 4th edition rule set. In 2016, Wizards of the Coast published &quot;Curse of Strahd&quot;, an adaptation of the original Ravenloft module for the 5th edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, which was generally well received, earning the 2016 ENnie Awards for Best Adventure and Best Art/Cover and runner up for Product of the Year.

==Reception==
&quot;Ravenloft&quot; won one award, and was included on two &quot;best of&quot; lists. In 1984, it won the Strategists&#x27; Club Award for Outstanding Play Aid. The book &quot;Dungeon Master For Dummies&quot; chose the module as one of the ten best classic adventures, saying it is &quot;perhaps our favorite &quot;D&amp;D&quot; adventure of all time&quot;, &quot;Ravenloft&quot; &quot;takes the Dracula legend and gives it a &quot;D&amp;D&quot; spin&quot;, and praised the detailed yet concise plot and isometric maps. The book also claims that Ravenloft &quot;inspired game designers and Dungeon Masters to take the art of adventure to the next level.&quot;

In 2004, on the 30th anniversary of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game, &quot;Dungeon&quot; magazine ranked the module as the second greatest &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; adventure of all time—behind &quot;Queen of the Spiders&quot;. The editor of &quot;Dungeon&quot; praised the placement of treasure, and Strahd&#x27;s motivation was described as &quot;a brilliant way to let fate drive the plot and evoke the mystery and mystique of Barovia&quot;. Bill Slavicsek, director of Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s RPGs and Miniatures department, noted that it was the first adventure to &quot;mix tone, story, and dungeon crawl&quot; in a module, and game designer Andy Collins agreed. Clark Peterson, president of Necromancer Games, singled out the maps and Strahd for praise, saying the vampire is &quot;perhaps one of the best villains of all time&quot;. Author John Rateliff also applauded the maps and the randomization, as well as Strahd&#x27;s duality as a vampire/magic-user. The catacombs, where player characters were teleported away and replaced with undead wights, was singled out at as the adventure&#x27;s &quot;defining moment&quot; by the magazine&#x27;s editors.

Reviews for &quot;Ravenloft&quot; were generally positive. Rick Swan reviewed the adventure in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 72. He commented that there was &quot;so much gothic atmosphere in &quot;Ravenloft&quot; that if it had any more, it&#x27;d flap its pages and fly away&quot;, and stated that the bulk of the adventure involving a search of Castle Ravenloft was &quot;not too interesting&quot; with encounters few and far between, and that the mechanic of using a regular deck of cards to simulate a gypsy fortune teller was &quot;silly and the results are too arbitrary&quot; but concluded that &quot;&quot;Ravenloft&quot; is such a refreshing change that even with its problems, it&#x27;s recommended.&quot; In the July 1984 issue of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; magazine, the module was given 8 out of 10 overall, with the reviewer mentioning its presentation as a positive, and its complexity as a negative. It was likened to a Hammer horror production and praised as enjoyable, although the reviewer said the game&#x27;s puns were tedious and detracted from the spooky atmosphere. &quot;White Dwarf&quot; reviewer Dave Morris said it &quot;should be a lot of fun – &#x27;light, relief&#x27; of a nerve-wracking and deadly sort&quot; and concluded that &quot;Ravenloft&quot; is &quot;full of clever touches&quot;, and &quot;features some first-class illustration and graphics&quot;. In a review for the January 1984 issue of &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine (published by a subsidiary of TSR), game designer Ken Rolston argued that, despite its design innovations, &quot;Ravenloft&quot; was still in essence a dungeon-style adventure. Rolston praised the randomization, the maps, and the player text (which is read aloud to the players by the DM). He said the player text &quot;consistently develops an atmosphere of darkness and decay.&quot; Despite this, Rolston felt that the adventure has trouble in developing a frightening tone. He singles out its use of common monsters in &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, an abundance of traps, and frequent combat interludes as elements that detract from the adventure&#x27;s spookiness by interrupting the module&#x27;s flow. Ultimately, he felt that in &quot;AD&amp;D terms it is a masterpiece&quot;, but not a work of &quot;Gothic horror&quot;. In a Polygon article from 2021, Charlie Hall wrote that the original &quot;Ravenloft&quot; &quot;has been criticized as derivative–and for reinforcing harmful stereotypes,&quot; but that it had an interesting conflicted villain. Tracy Hickman stated in 1998, &quot;I still believe the original Ravenloft modules were perhaps the best that ever had my name on them.&quot;

Scott Taylor for &quot;Black Gate&quot; in 2014 listed &quot;Ravnloft&quot; by Clyde Caldwell as #7 in The Top 10 TSR Cover Paintings of All Time.

<doc id="747917" wikidata="Q325141" url="?curid=747917" title="Charles Hawtrey (actor, born 1914)">
<text>George Frederick Joffre Hartree (30 November 1914 – 27 October 1988), known as Charles Hawtrey, was an English actor, comedian, singer, pianist and theatre director.

He began at an early age as a boy soprano, in which role he made several records, before moving on to radio. His later career encompassed the theatre (as both actor and director), the cinema (where he regularly appeared supporting Will Hay in the 1930s and 1940s in films such as &quot;The Ghost of St. Michael&#x27;s&quot;), through the &quot;Carry On&quot; films, and television.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Hawtrey was born in Hounslow, Middlesex, England, in 1914, to William John Hartree (1885–1952) and his wife Alice (née Crow) (1880–1965), of 217 Cromwell Road, as George Frederick Joffre Hartree. He took his stage name from the theatrical knight Sir Charles Hawtrey, and encouraged the suggestion that he was Hawtrey&#x27;s son (though his father was actually a London car mechanic).

Following study at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in London, he embarked on a career in the theatre as both actor and director.

===1920s and 1930s===
Hawtrey made his first appearance on the stage in Boscombe, a suburb of Bournemouth, as early as 1925. At the age of 11 he played a &quot;street Arab&quot; in Frederick Bowyer&#x27;s fairy play &quot;The Windmill Man&quot;.

His London stage debut followed a few years later when, at the age of 18, he appeared in another &quot;fairy extravaganza&quot;, this time at the Scala Theatre singing the role of the White Cat and Bootblack in the juvenile opera &quot;Bluebell in Fairyland&quot;. The music for this popular show had been written by Walter Slaughter in 1901, with a book by Seymour Hicks (providing part of the inspiration for J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan&quot;).

In &quot;Peter Pan&quot; at the London Palladium in 1931, Hawtrey played the First Twin, with leading parts taken by Jean Forbes-Robertson and George Curzon. This played in several regional theatres, including His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in Aberdeen. In 1936 Hawtrey played in a revival of the play, this time taking the larger role of Slightly, alongside the husband-and-wife partnership of Elsa Lanchester and Charles Laughton playing Peter and Hook. A review in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; commended Hawtrey for having &quot;a comedy sense not unworthy of his famous name&quot;.

Hawtrey played in &quot;Bats in the Belfry&quot;, a farce written by Diana Morgan and Robert MacDermott, which opened at the Ambassadors Theatre, Shaftesbury Avenue, on 11 March 1937. The cast included Ivor Barnard and Dame Lilian Braithwaite, as well as Vivien Leigh in the small part of Jessica Morton. The play ran for 178 performances at the Ambassadors Theatre before moving to the Hippodrome, Golders Green, Barnet, on 16 August 1937.

Hawtrey acted in films from an early age, first appearing while still a child, and as an adult his youthful appearance and wit made him a foil to Will Hay&#x27;s blundering old fool in the comedy films &quot;Good Morning, Boys&quot; (1937) and &quot;Where&#x27;s That Fire?&quot; (1939). In all he appeared in more than 70 films including, from this period, Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Sabotage&quot; (1936).

Hawtrey had another success on stage when he was cast in the role of Gremio in Tyrone Guthrie&#x27;s production of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; in 1939 at the Old Vic, in which Roger Livesey starred as Petruchio and his wife, Ursula Jeans, as Katherine.

Hawtrey was an accomplished musician. He recorded as a boy soprano and was billed as &quot;The Angel-Voiced Choirboy&quot; even at the age of fifteen. In 1930 he recorded several duets with the girl soprano Evelyn Griffiths (aged 11) for the Regal label. He was a semi-professional pianist for the armed forces during the Second World War.

===1940s===
Hawtrey continued in music revue, starring in Eric Maschwitz&#x27;s &quot;New Faces&quot; (1940) at the Comedy Theatre in London, and was praised for his &quot;chic and finished study of an alluring woman spy&quot;. &quot;New Faces&quot; included the premiere of the song &quot;A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square&quot;, which quickly became a wartime favourite.

During and after the Second World War, Hawtrey also appeared in the West End in such shows as &quot;Scoop&quot;, &quot;Old Chelsea&quot;, &quot;Merrie England&quot;, &quot;Frou-Frou&quot; and &quot;Husbands Don&#x27;t Count&quot;. Hawtrey also directed 19 plays, including &quot;Dumb Dora Discovers Tobacco&quot; at the Q Theatre in Richmond and, in 1945, &quot;Oflag 3&quot;, a war drama co-written with Douglas Bader.

By the 1940s, Hawtrey was appearing on radio during Children&#x27;s Hour in the series &quot;Norman and Henry Bones, the Boy Detectives&quot; (first broadcast in 1943) alongside the actress Patricia Hayes. Later, he provided the voice of snooty Hubert Lane, the nemesis of William in the series &quot;Just William&quot;. His catchphrase was &quot;How&#x27;s yer mother off for dripping?&quot;

Hawtrey&#x27;s film career continued, but &quot;The Ghost of St. Michael&#x27;s&quot; (1941) and &quot;The Goose Steps Out&quot; (1942) were his last films with Will Hay. After the latter film he asked Hay to give him bigger roles, but Hay refused.

Hawtrey also tried his hand at directing, making two films: &quot;What Do We Do Now?&quot; (1945), a musical mystery written by the English author George Cooper and starring George Moon; and &quot;Dumb Dora Discovers Tobacco&quot; (1946), featuring Flora Robson. Both films are believed lost.

In 1948, Hawtrey appeared at the Windmill Theatre, Soho, in comedy sketches presented as part of &quot;Revudeville&quot;. In the same year, he was incorrectly credited as &#x27;Major Markham&#x27; in &quot;The Story of Shirley Yorke&quot;, (but see &#x27;Filmography&#x27;, and Edit Note), using two pseudonyms.

In 1949 he appeared as the bar-hand/piano player in the Ealing comedy &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot;.

===1950s===
In 1956, Hawtrey appeared alongside his future &quot;Carry On&quot; co-star Hattie Jacques in the comedian Digby Wolfe&#x27;s ATV series &quot;Wolfe at the Door&quot;, a 12-week sketch show. Not screened in London, it ran in the Midlands from 18 June to 10 September. In this series Wolfe explored the comic situations that could be found by passing through doorways, into a theatrical dressing room, for example. The programmes were written by Tony Hawes and Richard Waring.

In the same year Hawtrey made a brief appearance in &quot;Tess and Tim&quot; (BBC) under the Saturday Comedy Hour banner. This short-run series starred the music hall comedians Tessie O&#x27;Shea and Jimmy Wheeler. In 1957, Hawtrey appeared in a one-off episode of &quot;Laughter in Store&quot; (BBC), this time working with Charlie Drake and Irene Handl.

Hawtrey&#x27;s television career gained a major boost with &quot;The Army Game&quot;, in which he played the part of Private &#x27;Professor&#x27; Hatchett. Loosely based on the film &quot;Private&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1956), the series followed the fortunes of a mixed bag of army National Service conscripts in residence at Hut 29 of the Surplus Ordnance Depot at Nether Hopping in remote Staffordshire.
&quot;I Only Arsked!&quot; (1958) was a feature film spin-off. Hawtrey left the series in 1958.

===1960s===
In &quot;Our House&quot; (1960–62) Hawtrey played a council official, Simon Willow. The series was created by Norman Hudis, the screenwriter for the first six &quot;Carry On&quot; films. Hattie Jacques and Joan Sims also starred. The series initially ran for 13 episodes from September to December 1960, returning the following year with Bernard Bresslaw and Hylda Baker added to the cast. Of the 39 episodes transmitted, only three survive.

&quot;Best of Friends&quot; (ITV, 1963) had essentially the same writers and production team as &quot;Our House&quot;. Hawtrey again acted alongside Hylda Baker but this time playing the role of Charles, a clerk in an insurance office, next door to a café run by Baker. She accompanied him on insurance assignments and protected him when he was feeling put upon by his Uncle Sidney, who wished to but could not, dismiss his nephew. The series ran to thirteen episodes (all lost) and was the last television series in which Hawtrey had a regular role.

By this time Hawtrey had become a regular in the &quot;Carry On&quot; films series. He was in the first, &quot;Carry On Sergeant&quot; (1958), and more than twenty others. His characters ranged from the wimpish through the effete to the effeminate and would always, regardless of the historical setting, be seen wearing Hawtrey&#x27;s signature round glasses. In her autobiography, Barbara Windsor wrote about Hawtrey&#x27;s alcoholism and his outrageous flirting with the footballer George Best. While filming &quot;Carry On Spying&quot; (1964), in which they played secret agents, Windsor thought that Hawtrey had fainted with fright over a dramatic scene on a conveyor belt. In fact, he had passed out because he was drunk. When he came on set with a crate of R. White&#x27;s Lemonade everyone knew that he had been on another binge. He smoked Woodbines and played cards between takes with Sid James and other members of the cast. In 1965, Hawtrey&#x27;s mother Alice died; Hawtrey was grief-stricken and started drinking more. Apparently, Hawtrey could often be heard talking to his mother in his dressing room, even though she had died.

Gerald Thomas, the director of the &quot;Carry On&quot; films, explained in 1966 that &quot;In the beginning Charles&#x27;s shock entrance was an accident, but realising the potential I set out deliberately to shock and now his first appearance is carefully planned... Apart from the comedy value of the unlikely role he plays, I&#x27;m careful to arrange the right timing for his actual appearance, so that the two factors combined surprise the audience into instant risibility.&quot; In the mid-1960s, Hawtrey performed in the British regional tour of the stage musical &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot;, which also included his &quot;Carry On&quot; co-star Kenneth Connor.

===Later life and career===
Although the &quot;Carry On&quot; films made a handsome return for their producer, Peter Rogers, the cast were not well remunerated, commonly receiving a standard fee of £5,000 per film. Hawtrey used public transport to get to and from work, and was once given a lift to Pinewood Studios by Laurence Olivier. Requested to embrace Barbara Windsor at a meeting with the press, Hawtrey hurriedly left the room, requesting a man in her place.

Hawtrey moved in 1968 to Deal, in Kent, reputedly because of the sailors at the local naval base. He lived at 117 Middle Street, Deal, where he remained until his death. There is a small commemorative blue plaque on the front exterior wall of this property to identify his former residence. Hawtrey cut an eccentric figure in the small town, becoming well known for promenading along the seafront in extravagant attire, waving cheerfully to the fishermen and for frequenting establishments patronised by students of the Royal Marines School of Music.

In 1970, he appeared with Sid James in the South African film &quot;Stop Exchange&quot;. He made an appearance in &quot;Grasshopper Island&quot; (ITV 1971), a children&#x27;s programme, alongside Patricia Hayes, Julian Orchard, Tim Brooke-Taylor and Frank Muir. Filmed in Wales and Corsica, this adventure series featured three small brothers nicknamed Toughy, Smarty and Mouse, who run away to find an uninhabited island.

Hawtrey&#x27;s last film was &quot;Carry On Abroad&quot; (1972), after which he was dropped from the series. Hoping to gain higher billing, Hawtrey withdrew from a television programme, &quot;Carry On Christmas&quot;, in which he was scheduled to appear, giving just a few days&#x27; notice. Peter Rogers, the producer of the &quot;Carry On&quot; films and shows, said &quot;He became rather difficult and impossible to deal with because he was drinking a lot. We used to feed him black coffee before he would go on. It really became clear that we were wasting time&quot;. Hawtrey&#x27;s alcohol consumption had noticeably increased since &quot;Carry On Cowboy&quot; (1965), which was released in the year his mother died.

Without steady film work, Hawtrey performed in pantomime and summer seasons in the regions, playing heavily on his &quot;Carry On&quot; persona in such shows as &quot;Carry On Holiday Show-time&quot; and &quot;Snow White&quot; at the Gaiety Theatre, Rhyl (summer 1970), &quot;Stop it Nurse&quot; at the Pavilion Theatre, Torquay (1972), and &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; again at the Theatre Royal, Nottingham (April 1974). His last pantomime season was Christmas 1979.

Hawtrey also played parts in a series of radio plays about a criminal gang written by Wally K. Daly for the BBC, alongside Peter Jones, Lockwood West and Bernard Bresslaw. These were &quot;Burglar&#x27;s Bargains&quot; (1979), &quot;A Right Royal Rip-off&quot; (1982) and &quot;The Bigger They Are&quot; (1985).

===Personal life===
Little is known about Hawtrey&#x27;s early years or later private life. He guarded his relationships very carefully as male homosexual sex was illegal and punishable by a prison sentence, until decriminalised by the Sexual Offences Act 1967. His outrageous drunken promiscuity did not attract sympathy, nor did his general peevish demeanour and increasing eccentricity earn him many close friends. If fans asked him for an autograph, Hawtrey would often swear at them and rip their paper in half.

Kenneth Williams recounted a visit to Deal in Kent where Hawtrey owned a house full of old brass bedsteads that the eccentric actor had hoarded, believing that &quot;one day he would make a great deal of money from them&quot;.

Hawtrey spent most of his life living with his mother, who suffered Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in later years. Another anecdote recounted by Williams describes how during the filming of &quot;Carry On Teacher&quot;, Joan Sims cried out to Hawtrey that his mother&#x27;s handbag had caught fire after her cigarette ash fell into it. Without batting an eyelid, Hawtrey poured a cup of tea into the bag to put out the flames, snapped the handbag shut and continued with his conversation. He would often bring his mother onto the set and then lock her in his dressing room when he was required to film a scene. Williams also recounted his gathering up of the sandwiches left over from a buffet for the &quot;Carry On&quot; cast. Williams was envious of Hawtrey&#x27;s acceptance of his sexuality: &quot;He can sit in a bar and pick up sailors and have a wonderful time. I couldn&#x27;t do it.&quot;

On 6 June 1981, Hawtrey suffered a heart attack. He next hit the headlines after his house caught fire on 5 August 1984. He had gone to bed with a 15-year-old rent boy and had left a cigarette burning on his sofa. Newspaper photographs from the time show a fireman leading an ill-looking, emotional, partially clothed and toupeeless Hawtrey to safety. Hawtrey told the press that &quot;The smell of smoke woke me up and there were flames coming up the stairway. I&#x27;ve lost a lot of valuable antiques and sentimental keepsakes but I am all right. It was all very frightening&quot;.

===Death===
In late September 1988 Hawtrey was admitted to the Buckland Hospital, Dover.He was discovered to be suffering from peripheral vascular disease, a condition of the arteries brought on by a lifetime of heavy smoking. Hawtrey was told that to save his life, his legs would have to be amputated. He refused the operation, allegedly saying that he preferred &#x27;to die with his boots on&#x27; and died at 3:30 am on 27 October 1988, at Windthorpe Lodge Nursing Home in Walmer, near Deal. It was claimed that on his deathbed he threw a vase at his nurse who asked for an autograph. On 2 November 1988, he was cremated and his ashes were scattered in Mortlake Crematorium, close to Chiswick in London. Just nine mourners attended; no friends or family were there.

==Legacy==
Hawtrey was portrayed by Hugh Walters in the television film &quot;Cor, Blimey!&quot; (2000). This was adapted by Terry Johnson from his stage play &quot;Cleo, Camping, Emmanuelle and Dick&quot; (1998); the original play did not feature Hawtrey as a character. In the BBC Four television play &quot;Kenneth Williams: Fantabulosa!&quot; (2006), Hawtrey was played by David Charles.

He is also the subject of a one-man biographical stage play, &quot;Oh, Hello!&quot;, by Dave Ainsworth, premiered in 2001 at The Torch Theatre, which was revived in 2014/2015 for the actor&#x27;s centenary, with Jamie Rees in the role.

He has been the subject of two biographies: &quot;Charles Hawtrey 1914–1988: The Man Who Was Private Widdle&quot; (2002) by Roger Lewis and &quot;Whatshisname: The Life and Death of Charles Hawtrey&quot; (2010) by the broadcaster Wes Butters. BBC Radio 4 broadcast Butters&#x27; documentary, &quot;Charles Hawtrey: That Funny Fella with the Glasses&quot;, in April 2010.

Reference is made to Hawtrey by John Lennon (seemingly nonsensically) just before the song &quot;Two of Us&quot; on the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Let It Be&quot; album. Lennon says: &quot;I Dig a Pygmy, by Charles Hawtrey and The Deaf-Aids. Phase one, in which Doris gets her oats.&quot;

The sleeve of the Smiths&#x27; compilation album &quot;The Very Best of The Smiths&quot; features Hawtrey.

<doc id="747932" wikidata="Q749827" url="?curid=747932" title="Kaidō">
<text> were roads in Japan dating from the Edo period. They played important roles in transportation like the Appian Way of ancient Roman roads. Major examples include the Edo Five Routes, all of which started at Edo (modern-day Tokyo). Minor examples include sub-routes such as the Hokuriku Kaidō and the Nagasaki Kaidō.

&quot;Kaidō&quot;, however, do &quot;not&quot; include San&#x27;yōdō, San&#x27;indō, Nankaidō and Saikaidō, which were part of the even more ancient system of Yamato government called Gokishichidō. These names were used for administrative units, and the roads within these units.

Many highways and railway lines in modern Japan follow the ancient routes and carry the same names. The early roads radiated from the capital at Nara or Kyoto. Later, Edo was the reference, and even today Japan reckons directions and measures distances along its highways from Nihonbashi in Chūō, Tokyo.

==Gokaidō==

The five main &quot;kaidō&quot; from Nihonbashi in Edo were:

*Tōkaidō (東海道) to Kyoto along the coastline
*Nakasendō (中山道) to Kyoto through the mountains
*Kōshū Kaidō (甲州街道) to Kōfu
*Ōshū Kaidō (奥州街道) to Shirakawa and other places of northern Japan
*Nikkō Kaidō (日光街道) to Nikkō

==Lodgings==
At various times, the government established post stations (&quot;shukuba&quot;) along the roads. These had lodgings for travelers and grew as commercial centers. These former post towns, along with castle and harbor towns, form a major category of cities in Japan.

==Cultural references==

&quot;Kaidō&quot; figure prominently in Japanese culture. The poet Matsuo Bashō memorialized his travels along the Ōshū Kaidō (and elsewhere) in the book &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot;. A set of woodblock prints by Hiroshige forms a travelogue of the Tōkaidō. Daimyō, making the required &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot; trip between their &quot;han&quot; and Edo, also traveled along the &quot;kaidō&quot; and stayed at post stations. Some woodblock prints show their stately processions. The Bunraku play &quot;Kanadehon Chūshingura&quot;, the fictionalized account of the true story of the Forty-seven Ronin, has several scenes set along various &quot;kaidō&quot;.

<doc id="747934" wikidata="Q1135949" url="?curid=747934" title="Fall of man">
<text>The fall of man, the fall of Adam, or simply the Fall, is a term used in Christianity to describe the transition of the first man and woman from a state of innocent obedience to God to a state of guilty disobedience. The doctrine of the Fall comes from a biblical interpretation of Genesis, chapters 1–3. At first, Adam and Eve lived with God in the Garden of Eden, but the serpent tempted them into eating the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which God had forbidden. After doing so, they became ashamed of their nakedness and God expelled them from the Garden to prevent them from eating the fruit of the tree of life and becoming immortal.

In mainstream (Nicene) Christianity, the doctrine of the Fall is closely related to that of original sin or ancestral sin. Nicene Christians believe that the Fall brought sin into the world, corrupting the entire natural world, including human nature, causing all humans to be born into original sin, a state from which they cannot attain eternal life without the grace of God. The Eastern Orthodox Church accepts the concept of the Fall but rejects the idea that the guilt of original sin is passed down through generations, based in part on the passage Ezekiel 18:20, which says a son is not guilty of the sins of his father.

Reformed Protestants believe that Jesus gave his life as a sacrifice for the elect, that they may be redeemed from their sin. Lapsarianism, understanding the logical order of God&#x27;s decrees in relation to the Fall, is divided into two categories: supralapsarian (prelapsarian, pre-lapsarian or antelapsarian, before the Fall) and infralapsarian (sublapsarian or postlapsarian, after the Fall).

The narrative of the Garden of Eden and the fall of humanity constitute a mythological tradition shared by all the Abrahamic religions, with a presentation more or less symbolic of Judeo-Christian morals and religious beliefs, which had an overwhelming impact on human sexuality, gender roles, and sex differences both in the Western and Islamic civilizations. Unlike Christianity, the other major Abrahamic religions, Judaism and Islam, do not have a concept of &quot;original sin&quot;, and instead have developed varying other interpretations of the Eden narrative.

==Genesis 3==

The doctrine of the fall of man is extrapolated from the traditional Christian exegesis of Genesis 3. According to the biblical narrative, God created Adam and Eve, the first man and woman in the chronology of the Bible. God placed them in the Garden of Eden and forbade them to eat fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The serpent tempted Eve to eat fruit from the forbidden tree, which she shared with Adam, and they immediately became ashamed of their nakedness. Subsequently, God banished Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, condemned Adam to work in order to get what he needed to live and condemned Eve to give birth in pain, and placed cherubim to guard the entrance, so that Adam and Eve would never eat from the &quot;tree of life&quot;.

The Book of Jubilees, an apocryphal Jewish work written during the Second Temple period, gives time frames for the events that led to the fall of man by stating that the serpent convinced Eve to eat the fruit on the 17th day, of the 2nd month, in the 8th year after Adam&#x27;s creation (3:17). It also states that they were removed from the Garden on the new moon of the 4th month of that year (3:33).

==Traditional interpretations==

===Immortality===
Christian exegetes of Genesis 2:17 (&quot;for in the day that you eat of it you shall die&quot;, also known as the &quot;commandment to life&quot;), have applied the day-year principle to explain how Adam died within a day. Psalms 90:4, 2 Peter 3:8, and Jubilees 4:29–31 explain that, to God, one day is equivalent to a thousand years and thus Adam died within that same &quot;day&quot;. The Greek Septuagint, on the other hand, has &quot;day&quot; translated into the Greek word for a twenty-four-hour period ().

According to Meredith Kline, the death threatened in Genesis 2:17 is &quot;not physical death but eternal perdition (later called &#x27;second death&#x27;).&quot; This is because, in covenant theology, the &quot;curse&quot; aspect of the commandment to life is balanced by its blessing, which is &quot;glorified eternal life&quot;, symbolised by the tree of life () and the Sabbath ().

According to the Genesis narrative, during the antediluvian age, human longevity approached a millennium, such as the case of Adam who lived 930 years. Thus, to &quot;die&quot; has been interpreted as to become mortal. However, the grammar does not support this reading, nor does the narrative: Adam and Eve are expelled from the Garden lest they eat of the second tree, the tree of life, and gain immortality.

===Original sin===


==== Roman Catholicism ====
The Catechism of the Catholic Church says: &quot;The account of the fall in &quot;Genesis&quot; 3 uses figurative language, but affirms [...] that the whole of human history is marked by the original fault freely committed by our first parents.&quot; St Bede and others, especially Thomas Aquinas, said that the fall of Adam and Eve brought &quot;four wounds&quot; to human nature. They are original sin (lack of sanctifying grace and original justice), concupiscence (the soul&#x27;s passions are no longer ordered perfectly to the soul&#x27;s intellect), physical frailty and death, and darkened intellect and ignorance. These negated or diminished the gifts of God to Adam and Eve of original justice or sanctifying grace, integrity, immortality and infused knowledge. This first sin was &quot;transmitted&quot; by Adam and Eve to all of their descendants as original sin, causing humans to be &quot;subject to ignorance, suffering and the dominion of death, and inclined to sin.&quot;

In the light of modern scripture scholarship, the future Pope Benedict XVI stated in 1986 that: &quot;In the Genesis story [...] sin is not spoken of in general as an abstract possibility but as a deed, as the sin of a particular person, Adam, who stands at the origin of humankind and with whom the history of sin begins. The account tells us that sin begets sin, and that therefore all the sins of history are interlinked. Theology refers to this state of affairs by the certainly misleading and imprecise term &#x27;original sin.&#x27;&quot; Although the state of corruption, inherited by humans after the primaeval event of original sin, is clearly called guilt or sin, it is understood as a sin acquired by the unity of all humans in Adam rather than a personal responsibility of humanity. In the Catechism of the Catholic Church, even children partake in the effects of the sin of Adam, but not in the responsibility of original sin, as sin is always a personal act. Baptism is considered to erase original sin, though the effects on human nature remain, and for this reason, the Catholic Church baptizes even infants who have not committed any personal sin.

==== Protestantism ====
In Covenant theology, Adam is said to have failed to fulfill the commandment to life and the Covenant of Works, which is summarized in . In verse 15, humanity is to &quot;dress&quot; and &quot;keep&quot; the garden (KJV), or to &quot;work it&quot; and &quot;take care of it&quot; (NIV). In verse 17, God gives the &quot;focal probationary proscription&quot;, that Adam must not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and a curse is attached if the proscription is transgressed, which is spiritual death. The Covenant required &#x27;perfect and personal obedience&#x27;, but Adam freely and willfully transgressed the commandment by accepting Satan&#x27;s lie in , demonstrating pride and a rejection of God&#x27;s authority as Creator and Lord, preferring his own will to God&#x27;s, leading to a corruption of his whole nature, which extended to his progeny, as is described in Article 14 of the Belgic Confession.We believe that God created man out of the dust of the earth, and made and formed him after his own image and likeness, good, righteous, and holy, capable in all things to will, agreeably to the will of God. But being in honour, he understood it not, neither knew his excellency, but wilfully subjected himself to sin, and consequently to death, and the curse, giving ear to the words of the devil. For the commandment of life, which he had received, he transgressed: and by sin separated himself from God, who was his true life, having corrupted his whole nature; whereby he made himself liable to corporal and spiritual death. And being thus become wicked, perverse, and corrupt in all his ways, he hath lost all his excellent gifts, which he had received from God, and only retained a few remains thereof, which, however, are sufficient to leave man without excuse; for all the light which is in us is changed into darkness, as the scriptures teach us, saying: &quot;The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not:&quot; where St. John calleth men darkness.

By the inverse to the concept of imputed righteousness, Adam, as the federal head of humanity, brought condemnation and death to all by his violation of the commandment to life. Kline justifies this interpretation by referencing , in which it says &quot;For if by one man&#x27;s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.&quot; Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. For as by one man&#x27;s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.&quot; In saying that, as a result of the Fall, man has become &quot;wicked, perverse, and corrupt in all his ways,&quot; the Confession expresses the doctrine of total depravity, which means that man is completely helpless and unable to rescue himself from sin, and &quot;cannot inherit the kingdom of God&quot; () but must be rescued by the second Adam, Jesus Christ, who is from heaven, as it says in , &quot;For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.&quot;

Indeed, (&quot;And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel&quot;), known as the protevangelium, is interpreted as a gracious declaration of the Covenant of Grace, in which God effects reconciliation with humanity and vanquishes the devil through Christ&#x27;s Atonement, which delivers from sin. This covenant is symbolically sealed when it is said that God &quot;clothed&quot; Adam and Eve&#x27;s nakedness, due to which they were ashamed. However, man was defiled and had to be expelled from the Garden, with the earth &quot;cursed&quot; for his sake, in an overthrow of man&#x27;s previous &quot;dominion&quot; over the earth which was gifted to him in . In , &quot;cherubim&quot; and &quot;a flaming sword&quot; guard the tree of life, access to which is only restored when Christ &quot;vicariously suffered the sword of judgment on the tree of death and so reopened the way to the tree of life.&quot;

==== Eastern Orthodoxy ====
Eastern Orthodox Christianity rejects the idea that the guilt of original sin is passed down through generations. It bases its teaching in part on Ezekiel 18:20, which says a son is not guilty of the sins of his father. The Church teaches that, in addition to their conscience and tendency to do good, men and women are born with a tendency to sin due to the fallen condition of the world. It follows Maximus the Confessor and others in characterising the change in human nature as the introduction of a &quot;deliberative will&quot; () in opposition to the &quot;natural will&quot; () created by God which tends toward the good. Thus, according to Paul the Apostle in his epistle to the Romans, non-Christians can still act according to their conscience.

Eastern Orthodoxy believes that, while everyone bears the consequences of the first sin (that is, death), only Adam and Eve are guilty of that sin. Adam&#x27;s sin is not comprehended only as disobedience to God&#x27;s commandment, but as a change in man&#x27;s hierarchy of values from theocentricism to anthropocentrism, driven by the object of his lust, outside of God, in this case the tree which was seen to be &quot;good for food&quot;, and something &quot;to be desired&quot; (see also theosis, seeking union with God).

===Meta-historical fall===
The biblical fall of man is also understood by some Christians (especially those in the Eastern Orthodox tradition) as a reality outside of empirical history that effects the entire history of the universe. This concept of a meta-historical fall (also called metaphysical, supramundane, or atemporal) has been most recently expounded by the Orthodox theologians David Bentley Hart, John Behr, and Sergei Bulgakov, but it has roots in the writings of several early church fathers, especially Origen and Maximus the Confessor. Bulgakov writes in his 1939 book &quot;The Bride of the Lamb&quot; translated by Boris Jakim (Wm. B. Eerdmans, 2001):

Empirical history begins precisely with the fall, which is its starting premise. But this beginning of history lies beyond empirical being and cannot be included in its chronology. ...[With the] narrative in Genesis 3, ...an event is described that lies beyond our history, although at its boundary. Being connected with our history, this event inwardly permeates it.

David Bentley Hart has written about this concept of an atemporal fall in his 2005 book &quot;The Doors of the Sea&quot; as well as in his essay &quot;The Devil’s March: Creatio ex Nihilo, the Problem of Evil, and a Few Dostoyevskian Meditations&quot; (from his 2020 book &quot;Theological Territories&quot;).

===Subordination===
In the subordination exegesis of the Fall, the natural consequences of sin entering the human race were prophesied by God to Eve in Genesis 3:16: the husband &quot;will rule over you&quot;. This interpretation is reinforced by comments in the First Epistle to Timothy, where the author gives a rationale for directing that a woman (NIV: possibly &quot;wife&quot;):
Therefore, some interpretations of these passages from Genesis 3 and 1 Timothy 2 have developed a view that women are considered as bearers of Eve&#x27;s guilt and that the woman&#x27;s conduct in the fall is the primary reason for her universal, timeless, subordinate relationship to the man.

Alternatively, Richard and Catherine Clark Kroeger argue that &quot;there is a serious theological contradiction in telling a woman that when she comes to faith in Christ, her personal sins are forgiven but she must continue to be punished for the sin of Eve.&quot; They maintain that judgmental comments against women in reference to Eve are a &quot;dangerous interpretation, in terms both of biblical theology and of the call to Christian commitment&quot;. They reason that &quot;if the Apostle Paul was forgiven for what he did ignorantly in unbelief&quot;, including persecuting and murdering Christians, &quot;and thereafter was given a ministry, why would the same forgiveness and ministry be denied women&quot; (for the sins of their foremother, Eve). Addressing that, the Kroegers conclude that Paul was referring to the promise of Genesis 3:15 that through the defeat of Satan on the cross of Jesus Christ, the woman&#x27;s child (Jesus) would crush the serpent&#x27;s head, but the serpent would only bruise the heel of her child.

===Agricultural revolution===

Authors such as Isaac Asimov, Daniel Hillel, and Daniel Quinn suggest that some of the Genesis 3 narrative&#x27;s symbolism may correlate to the experience of the agricultural revolution. &quot;The expulsion from the Garden of Eden is a folk memory of the beginning of agriculture. With that transition, humans no longer dwelled idyllically in a parkland, feeding on wild fruits or animals, but had begun the toilsome cultivation of cereals.&quot;

The serpent of the Genesis narrative may represent seasonal changes and renewal, as with the symbolism of Sumerian, Egyptian, and other creation myths. In Mesoamerican creation myths, Quetzalcoatl, a feathered serpent agricultural deity, is associated with learning as well as renewal.

==Other traditions==
===Gnosticism===


Gnosticism originated in the late 1st century CE in non-rabbinical Jewish and early Christian sects. In the formation of Christianity, various sectarian groups, labeled &quot;gnostics&quot; by their opponents, emphasised spiritual knowledge (&quot;gnosis&quot;) of the divine spark within, over faith (&quot;pistis&quot;) in the teachings and traditions of the various communities of Christians. Gnosticism presents a distinction between the highest, unknowable God, and the Demiurge, &quot;creator&quot; of the material universe. The Gnostics considered the most essential part of the process of salvation to be this personal knowledge, in contrast to faith as an outlook in their worldview along with faith in the ecclesiastical authority.

In Gnosticism, the biblical serpent in the Garden of Eden was praised and thanked for bringing knowledge (&quot;gnosis&quot;) to Adam and Eve and thereby freeing them from the malevolent Demiurge&#x27;s control. Gnostic Christian doctrines rely on a dualistic cosmology that implies the eternal conflict between good and evil, and a conception of the serpent as the liberating savior and bestower of knowledge to humankind opposed to the Demiurge or creator god, identified with the Hebrew God of the Old Testament. Gnostic Christians considered the Hebrew God of the Old Testament as the evil, false god and creator of the material universe, and the Unknown God of the Gospel, the father of Jesus Christ and creator of the spiritual world, as the true, good God. In the Archontic, Sethian, and Ophite systems, Yaldabaoth (Yahweh) is regarded as the malevolent Demiurge and false god of the Old Testament who generated the material universe and keeps the souls trapped in physical bodies, imprisoned in the world full of pain and suffering that he created.

However, not all Gnostic movements regarded the creator of the material universe as inherently evil or malevolent. For instance, Valentinians believed that the Demiurge is merely an ignorant and incompetent creator, trying to fashion the world as good as he can, but lacking the proper power to maintain its goodness. All Gnostics were regarded as heretics by the proto-orthodox Early Church Fathers.

===Islam===


In Islam, it is believed that Adam () and Eve () were misled by Iblīs (otherwise referred to as , ), who tempted them with the promise of immortality and a kingdom that never decays, saying: &quot;Your Lord has forbidden this tree to you only to prevent you from becoming angels or immortals.&quot;. Adam and Eve had been previously warned of Shayṭān&#x27;s scheming against them, and had been commanded by God to avoid the tree of immortality that Shayṭān referred to. Although God had reminded them that there was enough provision for them &quot;Here it is guaranteed that you will never go hungry or unclothed, nor will you ˹ever˺ suffer from thirst or ˹the sun’s˺ heat.&quot;, they ultimately gave in to Shayṭān&#x27;s temptation and partook of the tree anyway. Following this sin, &quot;their nakedness was exposed to them, prompting them to cover themselves with leaves from Paradise.&quot;, and were subsequently sent down from Paradise () onto the Earth with &quot;enmity one to another&quot;. However, God also gave them the assurance that &quot;when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance will neither go astray ˹in this life˺ nor suffer ˹in the next˺.&quot;

Muslim scholars can be divided into two groups regarding the reason behind Adam&#x27;s fall: the first point of view argues that Adam sinned out of his own free will, and only became a prophet later, after he was cast out of paradise and asked for forgiveness. They adhere to the doctrine according to which moral infallibility/immunity from sin (&quot;‘iṣmah&quot;) is a quality attributable to prophets only after they have been sent on a mission. According to the second point of view, Adam was predestined by God&#x27;s will to eat from the forbidden tree, because God planned to set Adam and his progeny on Earth from the beginning and thus installed Adam&#x27;s fall. For this reason, many Muslim exegetes do not regard Adam and Eve&#x27;s expulsion from paradise as a punishment for disobedience or a result from abused free will on their part, but rather as part of God&#x27;s wisdom (&quot;ḥikmah&quot;) and plan for humanity to experience the full range of his attributes, his love, forgiveness, and power to his creation. By their former abode in paradise, they can hope for return during their lifetime. Unlike Iblīs (&quot;al-Shayṭān&quot;), Adam asked for forgiveness for his transgression, despite God being the ultimate cause of his Fall. For that reason, God bestowed mercy upon Adam and his children. Some Muslim scholars view Adam as an image for his descendants: humans sin, become aware of it, repent for their transgressions (&quot;tawba&quot;), and return to God. According to this interpretation, Adam embodies humanity and his Fall shows humans how to act whenever they sin.

Within the Shīʿīte branch of Islam, Muslim followers of the Alawite sect believe that their souls were once luminous stars worshipping ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib in a world of light, but that upon committing sins of pride they were banished from their former state and forced to transmigrate in the world of matter.

==Literature and art==
The fall of man has been depicted many times in art, including in Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; (1504) and Titian&#x27;s &quot;The Fall of Man&quot; ( 1550).

In William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot; (1599), the King describes the betrayal of Lord Scroop – a friend since childhood – as being &quot;like another fall of man&quot;, referring to the loss of his own faith and innocence the treason has caused.

In the novel &quot;Perelandra&quot; (1943) by C. S. Lewis, the theme of the fall is explored in the context of a new Garden of Eden with a new, green-skinned Adam and Eve on the planet Venus, and with the protagonist the Cambridge scholar Dr. Ransom transported there and given the mission of thwarting Satan and preventing a new fall.

In the novel &quot;The Fall&quot; (1956) by Albert Camus, the theme of the fall is enunciated through the first-person account given in post-war Amsterdam, in a bar called &quot;Mexico City.&quot; Confessing to an acquaintance, the protagonist, Jean-Baptiste Clamence, describes the haunting consequence of his refusal to rescue a woman who had jumped from a bridge to her death. The dilemmas of modern Western conscience and the sacramental themes of baptism and grace are explored.

J. R. R. Tolkien included as a note to his comments about the &quot;Dialogue of Finrod and Andreth&quot; (published posthumously in 1993) the Tale of Adanel that is a reimagining of the fall of man inside his Middle-earth&#x27;s mythos. The story presented Melkor seducing the first Men by making them worship him instead of Eru Ilúvatar, leading to the loss of the &quot;Edenic&quot; condition of the human race. The story is part of &quot;Morgoth&#x27;s Ring&quot;.

In both Daniel Quinn&#x27;s &quot;Ishmael&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Story of B&quot; (1996) novels, it is proposed that the story of the fall of man was first thought up by another culture watching the development of the now-dominant totalitarian agriculturalist culture.

In Philip Pullman&#x27;s &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; series (1995, 1997, 2000), the fall is presented in a positive light, as it is the moment at which human beings achieve self-awareness, knowledge, and freedom. Pullman believes that it is not worth being innocent if the price is ignorance.

The novel &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; explores the fall of man. The storyline depicts young, innocent children who turn into savages when they are stranded on a desert island. &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; was originally named &quot;Strangers from Within&quot;, also showing his views of human nature.

The theme is also frequently depicted in historical European art. Lucas van Leyden, a Dutch engraver and painter during the Renaissance period, created several different woodcuts featuring Adam and Eve (two were part of his &quot;Power of Women&quot; series).

<doc id="747940" wikidata="Q1659634" url="?curid=747940" title="Imagination (Brian Wilson album)">
<text>Imagination is the third solo album by American musician Brian Wilson. It was issued in 1998 on Giant Records and distributed by Warner Music Group. The album received mixed reviews upon its release and its commercial performance was relatively weak. Its best-known track is &quot;Your Imagination&quot;, a Top 20 hit on adult contemporary radio. The second single, &quot;South American&quot;, was co-written by Jimmy Buffett. Wilson dedicated the song &quot;Lay Down Burden&quot; to his brother Carl Wilson, who succumbed to cancer earlier in the year.

Joe Thomas worked with Wilson as the album&#x27;s co-producer. He was held responsible by critics for the album&#x27;s style and production. Shortly after its release, Wilson filed a suit against Thomas, seeking damages and a declaration which freed him to work on his next album without involvement from Thomas. They later reunited for the Beach Boys reunion album &quot;That&#x27;s Why God Made the Radio&quot; (2012) and its followup &quot;No Pier Pressure&quot; (2015).

==Background==
The album&#x27;s recording sessions were immediately preceded by plans for a Beach Boys reunion album of new original material. According to Sean O&#x27;Hagan of the High Llamas, he was involved at one point, but backed away once it became clear to him that the project was unlikely to happen, also expressing disapproval with the &quot;middle of the road&quot; style that producer and collaborator Joe Thomas was persuading Wilson toward.

==Recording==
Wilson covered two of his own Beach Boys songs for &quot;Imagination&quot;: &quot;Keep an Eye on Summer&quot; and &quot;Let Him Run Wild&quot;. He had been dissatisfied with the vocal on the latter track, considering it too shrill and had named it his least favorite Beach Boys recording.

In addition, &quot;She Says That She Needs Me&quot; was the result of a lyric re-write by Carole Bayer Sager of an original Wilson composition from the mid-1960s, while the closing song, &quot;Happy Days&quot;, featured recycled elements of an unreleased Beach Boys track, &quot;My Solution&quot;, from 1970.

Thomas explained the differences between him and Andy Paley: &quot;I think that Andy more comes from that historical perspective than I do. I mean he knows a lot more about the way Brian recorded stuff back in the ‘60s. ... I’ve got my guys that I really like. And the fact is that right now, I also don&#x27;t like to record with a lot of people in the room at the same time. My reasoning is that I just can’t keep track of what’s going on. I think it’s a different way of recording that Brian likes this time around.&quot;

In 2006, biographer Peter Ames Carlin wrote: &quot;Joe took it upon himself to make sure that the new songs sounded as adult contemporary radio as possible. Most were dominated by tinkling keyboards, with plenty of melodic interjections from a gently plucked nylon-string guitar. If Brian tried to use an instrument or an arrangement that might not fit into the soothing blend, Joe would shake his head and slice it out of the picture. And if this bothered Brian, he didn&#x27;t show it.&quot; Brian reportedly stated: &quot;We call it a Brian Wilson album, but it&#x27;s really a Joe Thomas/Brian Wilson album.&quot;

When it came time to arrange Wilson&#x27;s songs for live performances, backing band member Darian Sahanaja remembers Thomas wanting to turn &quot;Caroline, No&quot; into a &quot;sexy, Sade kind of thing&quot;. He added: &quot;When liberties were taken, his [Brian&#x27;s] response would be, &quot;Uh, cool.&quot; Or he wouldn&#x27;t respond at all, so you&#x27;d have to ask, and he&#x27;d say, &quot;I think it sounds, uh, good.&quot; But as soon as we did a song close to his original arrangement, he&#x27;d go &quot;nuts&quot;: &quot;Wow! Outtasite!&quot; And then he&#x27;d want to hear it again. And that made perfect sense to me.&quot;

Many outtakes would later be revived for the Beach Boys&#x27; 2012 reunion album &quot;That&#x27;s Why God Made the Radio&quot; with Thomas&#x27; involvement.

==Release==
&quot;Imagination&quot; (Giant 24703) hit #88 in the US during a chart stay of 2 weeks. It reached #30 in the UK. On May 9, 1998, to promote the release of &quot;Imagination&quot;, Wilson performed a live taping for VH-1 at the St. Charles East High School auditorium in St. Charles, Illinois. The live performance included guest performances from Christopher Cross, Beach Boys member Bruce Johnston, and Eagles members Joe Walsh, Timothy B. Schmit and Steve Dahl. The concert, which was later incorporated with additional interviews from Elvis Costello, Eric Clapton, Sean Lennon, Stevie Wonder, and Jimmy Buffett, was released on VHS in 1998 and DVD in 1999 but is currently out-of-print. &quot;Your Imagination&quot; and &quot;Lay Down Burden&quot; were aired as music videos on VH1, with the album audio played over the video, and clips of Brian walking through the woods &quot;thinking&quot; and &quot;day dreaming&quot; and images of him and his brothers on the screen. He supported the album with a tour, beginning with the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on August 14, 1998.

A 5.1 channel surround remix of the album in the DTS CD format was also released by DTS Entertainment in 1998 (71021-51018-2-8).

==Reception==
On the subject of fans&#x27; reactions, Carlin wrote: &quot;&quot;Imagination&quot; bore many distressing signs. The real Brian Wilson would never homogenize his music to sound exactly like every other song on the radio, they complained.&quot; In an article for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Jason Fine said the album showed &quot;little evidence of Brian&#x27;s creative spark. Though he contributes some of his finest vocals — especially on two ballads, &#x27;Cry&#x27; and &#x27;Lay Down Burden&#x27; — the album&#x27;s saccharine soft rock doesn&#x27;t hint at the subtle magic of a classic Brian Wilson production.&quot;

Barney Hoskyns reviewed the album for &quot;Spin&quot; and wrote: &quot;the man&#x27;s penchant for writing these days in cheery major keys, coupled with the record&#x27;s horribly sterile sound, turns songs such as &#x27;Sunshine&#x27; and &#x27;Your Imagination&#x27; into nothing more than goofy retreads of early Beach Boys hits.&quot; John Mulvey of &quot;NME&quot; opined of the record: &quot;if there is one character flaw that has blighted [Wilson&#x27;]s music over the past 25-odd years, it has been his capacity to be easily led, his need to work with others resulting in a touching but misplaced faith in a host of lesser musical talents who frequently aren&#x27;t fit to wipe his arse, let alone collaborate with him.&quot; Music critic Robert Christgau declared: &quot;Submitting to adult-contempo tycoon Joe Thomas ... [Wilson is] just what you&#x27;d fear: a middle-aged pop pro who&#x27;s proud he&#x27;s no longer nuts and knows even less about the world than when he was.&quot;

In 2000, Wilson said of &quot;Imagination&quot;, &quot;I don&#x27;t like the sound. I don&#x27;t like my voice on it.&quot; When Andy Paley was asked to compare his collaborations with Brian to Thomas&#x27;, Paley responded: &quot;I think that the music is very, very different. Let’s put it this way... what he and I did is not an album. First of all, it’s way more stuff than you can put on an album, it’s probably more like four albums. It was something we enjoyed doing.&quot;

<doc id="747941" wikidata="Q431315" url="?curid=747941" title="Maria Franciszka Kozłowska">
<text>Feliksa Magdalena Kozłowska ( ), known by the religious name Maria Franciszka and the epithet &quot;&quot;, was a Polish religious sister, Christian mystic and visionary who founded a movement of renewal in the Roman Catholic church in the Congress Kingdom of Poland (founded in the Russian Partition of Poland). It was to follow the simplicity of the life of Mary, mother of Jesus. Early in the 20th century, she and this movement were excommunicated and became an autonomous church in fellowship with the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands. In 1935 it split in two and became the Old Catholic Mariavite Church and the Catholic Mariavite Church. Both denominations were part of a single schism from the Catholic Church which declared it as heretical in 1906.

== Early life ==
Feliksa Kozłowska was born in Wieliczna near Węgrów, into an impoverished Szlachta family, bearing the Nalecz coat-of-arms. She was eight months old when her father, Jakub, died in the January Uprising. She was raised by her mother, and paternal step-grandparents, called Pułaski. They lived with those relatives first in Czerwonka węgrowska, and later in Baczki. After home tuition, she graduated from a high school in Warsaw, speaking fluent Russian, English and French. Her first job was as a governess to the family of a general. By all accounts, she was an attractive and accomplished woman who rejected at least one offer of marriage. She planned instead to join the enclosed Visitation Sisters in Warsaw. However, due to tsarist regulations relating to religious orders, it proved impossible. At the age of nineteen, she entered the recently formed Congregation of the Franciscan Sisters of the Afflicted founded by Honorat Koźmiński, whose purpose was to care for the sick. Three years later, she evinced the need for more contemplation and a less busy setting. With permission from fr. Koźmiński, she left the Franciscan sisters.

On 8 September 1887, she formed on Koźmiński&#x27;s advice, with five other women, a covert religious community in the ancient city of Płock and went to live with them. They followed Franciscan spirituality and supported themselves with embroidery of church vestments. The income was very modest resulting in a relatively strict regime, abstaining from all meat and fish. She became superior of the new community, called the Congregation of Sisters of the Poor of Saint Mother Clare and took the religious name &quot;Maria Franciszka&quot;. The congregation followed the Rule of Saint Francis and added a fourth vow in addition to the conventional three. It was the promise to engage in perpetual Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. In time the needlework brought in commissions from wealthy clients which improved the material position of the women, while Kozłowska fostered their spiritual development.

In 1890 her widowed mother, Anna Kozłowska, having sold her properties in Warsaw, decided to move to Płock and live with her daughter. Initially, Anna had opposed her only daughter&#x27;s desire to become a nun, as she foresaw a better future for her in marriage, rather than grinding poverty in a convent. She eventually relented and decided to join her daughter&#x27;s community. In 1903 she made her religious profession by adopting the name, Maria Hortulana

=== Rift with Koźmiński and the beginning of the Mariavite movement ===
To begin with fr. Koźmiński had been very pleased with Franciszka&#x27;s religious progress. Nonetheless, in 1902, when she was forty years old, relations with her mentor broke down irretrievably. The reasons were that he disapproved of the attitude of some of his clerical brethren who, though educated and pious, had fallen under her spell and took spiritual direction from a woman. Another difficulty had been her introduction of certain religious practices without his leave.

In 1893, Kozłowska reported that she had experienced religious visions. The first vision supposedly instructed her to form a new clergy order with the primary goal of propagating the Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament and devotion to Our Lady of Perpetual Succour. They became known as &quot;Mariavites&quot;, taking their inspiration from imitating the life of Mary. The group broadened its appeal in the first ten years, and in 1903, it attempted to gain canonical status within the Catholic Church. Having first met her at Christmas 1901, Father Jan Kowalski led the delegation under his newly assumed religious name, Maria Michał Kowalski. Kozłowska, not wishing to create difficulties with the church authorities, largely stayed out of public view and left the structural and political implications of the movement to others, particularly to Kowalski.

==Attempt at recognition==
In an effort to regularise the movement in the eyes of the Catholic Church, the group submitted documents to the local Bishop of Płock, in whose diocese Kozłowska lived and to two leading archbishops. The latter two rejected the idea out of hand, but the Płock authorities set up a Canonical Inquisition into the movement. To expedite matters, Kowalski led a delegation of Mariavites to the Holy See in 1903 but was delayed by a Conclave. Eventually, they were able to meet with Pope Pius X in 1904. Kowalski and his fellow Mariavites were severely disappointed when, in August 1904, the Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition (CRUI) concluded that Kozłowska&#x27;s &quot;visions&quot; were mere hallucinations.

In April 1906, Pius X issued an encyclical, &quot;Tribus circiter&quot;, which excommunicated Kozłowska and her followers. It also harshly criticised her followers for treating her as a living saint and on par with the Blessed Virgin. In December 1906, the excommunicated Kozłowska and Kowalski by name as well as their adherents and supporters. This marked the first instance in history where an individual woman was excommunicated by name as a heretic in contrast, to being excommunicated by virtue of her membership of a group deemed to be heretical.

==Independence==
In November 1906, only a month prior to the ex-communication from the Catholic Church, the Russian government granted the movement official status in the part of Poland under its control after the October Manifesto granting everyone freedom of religion and so a split in the Polish Roman Catholic Church (her enemies supported the idea that could help foster a split in manifest Polish nationalism as well). Having already been in touch with the Union of Utrecht of the Old Catholic Churches, the Mariavites were invited to attend their 1909 Congress in Utrecht, at which Kowalski was elevated to the rank of bishop, granting him the power of the apostolic succession. In 1912, the Mariavite church gained full recognition as a legal denomination in the Russian partition of Poland. They had already begun work on their own cathedral in Płock, the Temple of Mercy and Charity. They had as many as 50,000 to 60,000 adherents distributed over sixteen parishes and increased further during World War I. At its probable peak in 1917, the church may have had up to 160,000 adherents.

In 1918, Kozłowska revealed the contents of her final vision. The following year, two years prior to her death, the Mariavites adopted the name, &quot;Old Catholic Mariavite Church&quot;.

==Legacy and myth==
Following the end of World War I the Second Polish Republic was established. A rise in hostility toward them by the new government caused a decline in Mariavite fortunes and membership declined, with many returning to Catholicism. This trend accelerated in 1921 after Kozłowska died and Kowalski succeeded her as the church&#x27;s guiding spirit and formal leader.

Kowalski published a biography of Kozłowska with a compilation of her visions and tried to keep her memory alive in the minds of followers while making her authority over her followers his own. The hagiographic nature of this work and the &quot;elevation&quot; of Kozłowska to a status apparently co-equal with that of the Blessed Virgin Mary, if not with the Holy Spirit, was excessive even to many Mariavites. This undermined Kowalski&#x27;s credibility with the faithful and precipitated the eventual split in the movement. Many of the factual details about Kozłowska&#x27;s life remained unclear, and some of the myths surrounding her were perpetuated by Kowalski.

<text>The Cremisan Valley is a valley located in Palestine on the seam line between the West Bank and Jerusalem.

The valley is one of the last green areas in the Bethlehem district, with vast stretches of agricultural lands and recreational grounds. The Salesian Sisters Convent and School, the Salesian Monastery and Cremisan Cellars are located in the valley.

==Salesian Sisters Convent and School==
The main convent and monastery are part of the Salesian order, founded by Don Bosco. The convent and school were opened in 1960 and have around 400 students in their primary school, kindergarten, as well as the school for children with learning disabilities. The school also hosts a number of community activities in the afternoons and summer camps.

==Cremisan Monastery==

The monastery, located on a hill 850 meters above sea level, is five kilometers from Bethlehem. It was built in 1885 on ruins of a 7th century Byzantine monastery. The main monastery, housed in a building featuring stone floors, thick walls and high arched ceilings, is decorated with pictures of Pope John Paul II and Don Bosco.

It is within Jerusalem municipal limits, while the storeroom on the other side of the parking lot is in the West Bank. The road to the monastery passes one of the coordinating offices between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

==Cremisan Cellars==

Cremisan Cellars is a winery in operation since the establishment of the monastery in the 19th century. Modern equipment was introduced in 1977. The winery is run by the Salesians of St. John Bosco.The grapes are primarily harvested from the al-Khader area. Only 2% of the wine production (around 700,000 litres per year) is made from Cremisan&#x27;s own grapes. The rest comes mainly from Beit Jala, Beit Shemesh, and the Hebron area.

== Land appropriation ==
In 2006 the Israeli military authorities issued an order envisaging the creation of a separation barrier which would have confiscated some 3,000 dunams of private local farming terrain and also Catholic church property by enclosing both parts of Beit Jala, and the settlement of Gilo within its precincts, while breaking up the contiguity of the two Salesian monasteries in the valley. The barrier would have divided the 19th Century Salesian monastery, relocated on the Jerusalem side from the neighbouring convent and primary school run by nuns.
On April 24, 2013, the Special Appeals Committee of the Tel Aviv Magistrate&#x27;s Court approved land expropriation for the proposed security barrier along a route that would have annexed about 75 percent of the convent&#x27;s property and enclose it on three sides. The wall would also annex the farmland of 58 Palestinian families. Israel military authorities argued that construction of the wall was a necessary measure, or &quot;matter of expediency,&quot; designed to thwart future attacks by would-be terrorists infiltrating into Israeli towns and settlements.

2012 proposals for the barrier show it looping around the convent, keeping it on the Palestinian side, but splitting it from the neighbouring monastery, which would be on the Israeli side. The elementary children would still be allowed to attend the school, passing soldiers at an Israeli checkpoint. Landowners would be given limited access via an agricultural gate.

According to the human rights group B&#x27;Tselem, 85 percent of the route falls inside the West Bank instead of following the Green Line. Residents of Beit Jala believe the route was chosen to connect the West Bank Israeli settlement of Har Gilo to nearby Gilo.

In a May 6, 2013 letter to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Bishop Richard Pates, the chairman of the bishops&#x27; Committee on International Justice and Peace for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops wrote, &quot;The Cremisan Valley is a microcosm of a protracted pattern that has serious implications for the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict...As the wall moves and constricts more communities in the West Bank, the possibility of a future two-state resolution becomes less likely. Moving the wall and disassociating Palestinian families from their lands and livelihoods will incite more resentment against the State of Israel among residents of the West Bank, not less, increasing the frustrations that can lead to violence.&quot;

During the Second Intifada of 2000 there were regular shootings from Beit Jala to Gilo. Israeli Defence Ministry spokesman Joshua Hantman said &quot;The route of the security barrier is based on the specific security considerations of the area. In the Beit Jala region, it is there solely to keep terror out of Jerusalem.&quot; Palestinians interpreted the project as a land grab to gain more territory on the West Bank. During the Intifada, a wall was built around Gilo to protect the settlers, but was mostly removed, leaving only 80 of the original 800 plates in place, in August 2010. Israeli Lieutenant-General Hezi Revivo said, &quot;The security situation in the area is better than it was in the period before the wall was built. It was constructed as a response to the attacks during Operation Defensive Shield and today I see no problem with removing it.&quot;

Fouad Twal, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem said in 2013, &quot;We remind Israeli decision-makers that the expropriation of lands does not serve the cause of peace and does not strengthen the position of the moderates.&quot;
The 9 year legal battle waged by the two local monasteries and the 58 Palestinian landowners in Beit Jala ended when the Israeli Supreme Court ruled in favour of the petitioners in April 2015. The monastery and convent, it determined, ought to remain connected on the Palestinian side of the separation barrier. It was the second such decision in favour of maintaining the integrity of an area on the West Bank, following the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in favour of the villagers of Battir, who had petitioned to stop the separation wall from breaking up their traditional lands.

== Terror attack ==
On October 22, 1984, two Israeli students, Ron Levi and Revital Seri, were murdered beside the Cremisan monastery by a Palestinian from Deheishe, Issa Abd Rabbo. A week later an Israeli soldier, David Ben-Shimol, stole and shot a LAW rocket at a Palestinian bus as an unauthorized retaliation, killing one and injuring 10 Palestinians.

<text>Douglas Jung (; February 25, 1924 – January 4, 2002) was a Canadian lawyer, politician, military officer, and Special Operations Executive secret agent. A Conservative, he was the first member of a visible minority elected to the Parliament of Canada, as well as the first Canadian Member of Parliament (MP) of Chinese and Asian descent in the House of Commons of Canada.

==Early life, military career and education==
Douglas Jung was born in Victoria, British Columbia, on February 25, 1924. During his childhood, the Government of Canada passed numerous pieces of legislation that disenfranchised Chinese in Canada. Jung and a group of young men from British Columbia enlisted in the Canadian Army during World War II in order to change the status of Chinese Canadians. Jung explained his reasons for enlisting as: &quot;Some of us realized that unless we volunteered to serve Canada during this hour of need, we would be in a very difficult position after the war ended to demand our rights as Canadian citizens because the Canadian government would say to us, &quot;What did you do during the war when everybody else was out fighting for Canada? What did you do?&quot; So a few of us volunteered to serve, and my group was probably the first to join up.&quot;

=== World War II ===
Although Jung enlisted in the Canadian Army in 1939, he did not receive his first assignment until 1944, mainly because politicians in Ottawa and Victoria did not want to deal with the issues of enfranchising the Chinese after the war. However, Winston Churchill&#x27;s wartime Special Operations Executive recruited Jung and a group of Chinese-Canadian soldiers into Force 136, a team of secret agents who deployed to British Malaya to train local guerrillas to resist the Japanese Imperial Army occupying Malaya and Singapore. The mission for the Asian Canadian soldiers was known as Operation &quot;Oblivion&quot;. They received parachute training at Australia and prepared themselves to fight in South West Pacific. However, the operation came to an abrupt cancellation. Jung instead deployed to Japanese-occupied British Borneo and New Guinea, and led his troops in search and rescue missions.

=== Post-WWII ===
After the war, Chinese in Canada were enfranchised in 1947. Veterans Affairs Canada provided funds so that Jung and his Chinese-Canadian comrades could obtain a university education. Jung graduated from the University of British Columbia in 1953 with Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws degrees. He was called to the British Columbia Bar in 1954.

==Political career==
Douglas Jung joined the Progressive Conservative Party in the early 1950s. He had vowed not to join the Liberal Party of Canada because of its racist legislation against Chinese in the past. Jung was elected as an MP in 1957, representing the riding of Vancouver Centre, under the John Diefenbaker government. In his maiden speech in the House of Commons, he urged Canada to take a leading role in serving as a bridge to the Pacific Rim countries.

Jung&#x27;s other achievements include taking part in the debate on the implementation in 1960 by the Hon. Ellen Fairclough, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, of the Chinese Adjustment Statement Program that granted amnesty to illegal immigrants from Hong Kong, also known as &quot;paper sons&quot;. He also represented Canada in the United Nations as an alternate member of the Legal Delegation to the United Nations (Source: Department of Foreign Affairs).

In 1962, Jung was defeated in his riding of Vancouver-Centre by voters in the Chinatown community disillusioned by his handling of the amnesty issue, in which they viewed Jung as siding with government authorities against Chinese Canadians. Progressive Conservatives had also tried to strike 500-600 Chinese voters from the rolls in order to mitigate this issue. 

His profusion of honours included the Order of Canada and the Order of British Columbia, the highest honours a citizen can receive from the federal and provincial governments, respectively. Other awards came from the Chinese Benevolent Association, S.U.C.C.E.S.S. Chinese Cultural Centre, Chinese Canadian National Council and Chinese Association in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Thunder Bay and Toronto, Ontario, as well as the Quebec Japanese Canadian Citizenship Association in Montreal.

==Other achievements==

Jung was also a prominent figure in the community, especially the Vancouver Chinese community. They include: Life President of Army Navy Air Force Veterans in Canada Unit #280, Patron of S.U.C.C.E.S.S.: Director of the Vancouver Symphony. B.C.: Deputy Director of the Governor General&#x27;s 1992 Regional Celebration of Canada 125th Anniversary. Director of the Far East Relations of the Former Parliamentarians Association and the President of Japan Karate Association of Canada, which awarded him a sixth degree Black Belt.

On September 7, 2007, the Hon. Jason Kenney, Secretary of State (Multiculturalism and Canadian Identity) announced that the federal building located at 401 Burrard Street in Vancouver would be named after Douglas Jung, as the first Chinese-Canadian elected to Parliament.

==Death==
While marching with fellow veterans in 1995, Jung suffered a serious heart attack. He never completely recovered and died in 2002 due to related complications.

<text>A superdollar (also known as a superbill or supernote) is a very high quality counterfeit United States one hundred-dollar bill, alleged by the U.S. government to have been made by unknown organizations or governments. In 2011, government sources stated that these counterfeit bills were in &quot;worldwide circulation&quot; from the late 1980s until at least July 2000 in an extradition court case.

While there are many features on supernotes that can be detected with conventional methods, new, more sophisticated supernotes could be produced to circumvent some conventional detection methods. Thus it may be possible to see some supernotes in circulation until they are detected.

Various groups have been suspected of creating such notes, and international opinion on the origin of the notes varies. The U.S. government believes that North Korean officials have passed off supernotes in various countries and accuses North Korea of producing them. Over $35 million worth of counterfeit $100 bills were produced by British criminals, who were arrested in 2002.

A new $100 bill design intended to thwart counterfeiting, incorporating a &quot;3D security ribbon&quot;, color-shifting numerals and drawings, and microprinting, entered circulation in 2013.

==Production==
Supernotes are said to be made with the highest quality of ink printed on a cotton/linen blend, and are designed to recreate the various security features of United States currency, such as the red and blue security fibers, the security thread, and the watermark. Moreover, they are printed using an intaglio printing process or with engraved plates, the same process used by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) of the U.S. government for legitimate notes. In most counterfeiting, offset printing or color inkjet and laser printing are most common means of making counterfeit money.

Experts who have studied supernotes extensively and examined them alongside genuine bills point out that there are many different varieties of supernotes. In 2006 the &quot;family&quot; of fraudulent bills was thought to have 19 members. However, producers of the supernotes have improved the product since 2006, and more varieties exist. Early versions of the fake notes, for example, lacked the bands of magnetic ink printed in distinctive patterns on different denominations of U.S. money; later counterfeits rectified this error. Several of the inconspicuous &quot;mistakes&quot; on the first supernotes were corrected, some several times.

On the genuine $100 bill, for example, the left base vertical line of the lamp post near the figure on the reverse of the $100 note is weak. The first supernotes printed this line too distinctly, rendering the counterfeit more authoritatively printed than the original. Later supernotes over-corrected this strong line by removing it altogether. Similarly, the hands of the clock on Independence Hall on the genuine bill extend slightly beyond the inner circle; on the supernotes they stop short of it.

On the front of the supernote, in the &quot;N&quot; in &quot;UNITED STATES&quot;, a slash can be seen to the right of the diagonal and the right ascender of the letter; there is none on the genuine note. Other differences in vignetting and in the defining lines of the top ornament in Independence Hall have been observed. Journalist Klaus Bender and others have speculated that the counterfeiters introduced these differences to be able to distinguish their product from the original, but there is no obvious way to confirm this.

==Arrests of United States distributors==
In two sting operations running from 2002 to 2005, dubbed &quot;Operation Smoking Dragon&quot; and &quot;Operation Royal Charm&quot;, United States agents arrested at least 87 people on charges that included smuggling superdollars. About $4.5 million in counterfeit currency was seized, much in $100 bills. No definitive origin for the counterfeit $100 bills was determined.

==Confirmed sources==

===British criminals===
In 2005, British criminals, Anatasios Arnaouti and four others, were convicted of conspiracy to make counterfeit currency in Manchester, England. They were arrested in 2002 after an operation that involved the U.S. Secret Service. The counterfeit currency recovered included $3.5 million worth of $100 bills and £2.5 million of £10 notes, which Bank of England experts said were of excellent quality. The police stated that &quot;The potential to undermine the economy of the UK and US was very significant.&quot;

The printer admitted to making 350,000 $100 bills, $35 million, over 18 months. The gang was using equipment capable of printing £1 million per day, and claimed to produce $500,000 in fake dollars a day. The counterfeiting operation was running for over two years.

==Possible sources==

===North Korea===
It has been said that North Korea has passed off superdollars (Korean: ) in various countries. The counterfeit bills also circulate both within North Korea and around its border with China. There is, however, some doubt about the reliability of North Korean defectors&#x27; claims, on which the United States partially bases its accusations, along with South Korean intelligence sources.

The testimony of the North Korean defectors is considered by some to be suspect, and one witness has since gone into hiding after charges were filed accusing them of fabricating the story for money. These witnesses claimed that the factory where the notes are printed is located in the city of Pyongsong and is part of Room 39.

One defector had taken the notes to experts in the South Korean intelligence agency, who did not believe that they were fakes. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; interviewed a North Korean chemist who described the operation; insisting on anonymity, he spoke about the technical details of the process as well as the distribution method, which he said was through North Korean diplomats and international crime syndicates.

The U.S. government has theorized that the bills were spread in two ways:
* North Korean diplomats almost always travel through Moscow on their way to other destinations. At the Embassy of North Korea in Moscow, they receive dollars for their expenses. According to the claims of one defector, forgeries are intermingled with real dollars in about a 1 to 1 ratio. He said that most of the diplomats themselves do not know that they are being given counterfeits, and claimed that it is possible to purchase a $100 bill for US$50–70 directly from North Korean agents, and sometimes as low as $10–20 in bulk purchases.
* The alleged chief of staff of the Official Irish Republican Army, Seán Garland, was followed and seen traveling to Moscow and visiting the North Korean embassy along with some ex-KGB officers. Allegedly, Garland would then, with the help of some associate couriers, move this money to the Irish capital of Dublin and to Birmingham, England, where the notes would be exchanged for pounds or authentic dollars. His alleged scheme, involving several international crime syndicates and transactions worth millions of dollars, was uncovered after a tip-off. Garland was arrested in Belfast, Northern Ireland, but fled south to the Republic of Ireland after being released for medical leave. On 21 December 2011, the Irish High Court dismissed the US application for Garland&#x27;s extradition, as the alleged offence took place in Ireland and was therefore not subject to extradition. The case was referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions to consider prosecution in Ireland.

Since 2004, the United States has frequently called for pressure against North Korea in an attempt to end the alleged distribution of supernotes. It has investigated the Bank of China, Banco Delta Asia, and Seng Heng Bank. The U.S. eventually prohibited Americans from banking with Banco Delta Asia. However, an audit of the bank disputed U.S. allegations and indicated that the only time Banco Delta Asia had knowingly handled counterfeit money was in 1994 when it discovered and turned over $10,000 in counterfeit $100 bills to local authorities. The United States has threatened North Korea with sanctions over its alleged involvement with the supernotes, though it said those sanctions would be a separate issue from the nuclear sanctions.

South Korea has attempted to play a middle role, encouraging all parties to reach an acceptable conclusion without animosity. In a meeting on January 22, 2006, the U.S. laid out its evidence and tried to persuade the Seoul government to take a harder line on the issue and impose similar financial sanctions, but was rebuffed. South Korea prefers to place blame on North Korean organizations rather than the government, believing that this change in rhetoric can mollify North Korea and be conducive to a resumption of the six-party talks.

Several North Korean diplomats have been arrested on suspicion of passing the counterfeit bills, but have used diplomatic immunity to evade charges.

On February 2, 2006, banks in Japan voluntarily enforced sanctions on Banco Delta Asia identical to those imposed by the United States. Later in August 2006, the &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; reported that North Korea had opened 23 bank accounts in 10 countries, with the likely intent of laundering more superbills.

The U.S. Secret Service estimates that North Korea has produced $45 million in superdollars since 1989. They allege that the bills are produced at the Pyongsong Trademark Printing Factory, which is under the supervision of General O Kuk-ryol.

In 2008, a McClatchy Newspapers article reported that the United States no longer explicitly accused the North Korean government of producing supernotes, and that the Swiss Bundeskriminalpolizei, which regularly searches for counterfeit currency, doubted that North Korea produced supernotes. However, in 2009, a report by the Congressional Research Service renewed the accusation.

===Iran===
Before the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Iran used intaglio machines to print its currency, as did the United States and other governments. There has been some speculation that Iran has used these to print superdollars.

===CIA===
The CIA has been accused of printing and using counterfeit notes to fund off-the-books foreign operations. Klaus Bender, an author of works on counterfeiting, states that the notes are of such high quality that they could only be produced by a government agency such as the CIA.

===Other===
Other theories of the bills&#x27; origin have become increasingly popular; Iran remains a suspect to many, while others blame independent criminal gangs operating out of Russia or China. In 2000, the Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies, an Israel-based think tank, laid the blame on Syria: &quot;The Bekaa Valley has become one of the main distribution sources, if not production points, of the &#x27;supernote&#x27; – counterfeit U.S. currency so well done that it is impossible to detect.&quot;

<text>The Fur language or For; (Fur: poor’íŋ belé’ŋ) is a Nilo-Saharan language spoken by the Fur of Darfur in Western Sudan and Chad. It is part of a broader family of languages known as the Fur languages.

==Phonology==

The consonantal phonemes are:


The vowels are: &quot;a e i o u&quot;. There is dispute whether the –ATR vowels are phonetic variants or separate phonemes.

There are two underlying tonemes, &quot;L&quot; (low) and &quot;H&quot; (high); phonetically, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;mid&quot;, &quot;HL&quot;, and &quot;LH&quot; are all found.

Metathesis is an extremely common and regular grammatical phenomenon in Fur: when a consonant pronoun prefix is prefixed to a verb that begins with a consonant, either the verb&#x27;s first consonant is deleted or it changes places with the following vowel; e.g.:


There are also various assimilation rules.

== Writing ==
Fur is written in the Latin alphabet with the addition of the letters a̱ (a with macron below), ɨ, ŋ, and ʉ, and the digraph ny.

High tone is marked by the acute accent, falling tone is marked by circumflex, rising tone is marked by caron (&quot;wedge&quot;), and low tone is unmarked.

==Morphology==

===Plurals===

Noun, and optionally adjective, plurals can be formed with &quot;-a&quot; (&quot;-ŋa&quot; after vowels):


This suffix also gives the inanimate 3rd person plural of the verb:
Vowel-final adjectives can take a plural in &quot;-lá&quot;, as well as &quot;-ŋa&quot;:

A similar suffix (metathesized and assimilated to become &quot;-ól/-úl/-ál&quot;) is used for the plural of the verb in some tenses.

A few CVV nouns take the plural suffix H&quot;-ta&quot;;

At least two nouns take the suffix -i:

Nouns with the singular prefix &quot;d-&quot; (&gt; &quot;n-&quot; before a nasal) take the plural &quot;k-&quot;; these are about 20% of all nouns. In some cases (mostly body parts) it is accompanied by L; e.g.:


*In some cases, the singular also has a suffix &quot;-ŋ&quot;, not found in the plural:
*Sometimes, a further plural suffix from those listed above is added:

*Sometimes the suffix &quot;-(n)ta&quot;, is added:
*One noun, as well as the demonstratives and the interrogative &quot;which&quot;, take a plural by simply prefixing &quot;k-&quot;L:
*Several syntactic plurals with no singulars, mostly denoting liquids, have &quot;k-&quot;L-&quot;a&quot;; &quot;kewa&quot; &quot;blood&quot;, &quot;koro&quot; &quot;water&quot;, &quot;kona&quot; &quot;name, song&quot; &quot;koonà&quot;.

===Nouns===

The locative case can be expressed by the suffix &quot;-le&quot; or by reversing the noun&#x27;s final tone, e.g.:

The genitive (English possessive s) is expressed by the suffix &quot;-iŋ&quot; (the &quot;i&quot; is deleted after a vowel.) If the relationship is possessive, the possessor comes first; otherwise, it comes last; e.g.:

===Pronouns===

Independent subject:
The object pronouns are identical, apart from being low tone and having -ŋó added to the plural forms.

Prefixed subject pronouns:

Thus, for example, on the verb &quot;bʉo-&quot; &quot;tire&quot;:

&quot;gi&quot;, described as the &quot;participant object pronoun&quot;, represents first or second person objects in a dialogue, depending on context.

Possessives (singular; take k- with plural nouns):

===Verbs===
The Fur verbal system is quite complicated; verbs fall into a variety of conjugations. There are three tenses: present, perfect, and future. Subjunctive is also marked. Aspect is distinguished in the past tense.

Derivational suffixes include &quot;-iŋ&quot; (intransitive/reflexive; e.g.
and gemination of the middle consonant plus &quot;-à/ò&quot; (intensive; e.g.
Negation is done with the marker &quot;a-...-bà&quot; surrounding the verb; &quot;a-bai-bà&quot; &quot;he does not drink&quot;.

===Adjectives===
Most adjectives have two syllables, and a geminate middle consonant: e.g. &quot;àppa&quot; &quot;big&quot;, &quot;fùkka&quot; &quot;red&quot;, &quot;lecka&quot; &quot;sweet&quot;. Some have three syllables: &quot;dàkkure&quot; &quot;solid&quot;.

Adverbs can be derived from adjectives by addition of the suffix &quot;-ndì&quot; or L&quot;-n&quot;, e.g.:
Abstract nouns can be derived from adjectives by adding &quot;-iŋ&quot; and lowering all tones, deleting any final vowel of the adjective, e.g.:
==Media in Fur language==
Radio Dabanga – broadcasts daily news in the Fur language and in other languages local to Darfur.

<text>Florida Blue Key is a student leadership honor society at the University of Florida. It was founded in 1923. The organization is the oldest and most prestigious leadership honorary in the state of Florida. Members include notable politicians and prominent business leaders. Florida Blue Key recognizes a class of students each semester who have displayed exemplary leadership on campus and have made significant contributions to the University of Florida through service.

==History==

===Founding and early years===

Florida Blue Key was established November 1, 1923, several days before the University&#x27;s homecoming celebration. At the suggestion of President Albert Murphree, dean of general extension Bert C. Riley brought together a group of student leaders to form an organization recognizing leadership and promoting service. Among the duties of Florida Blue Key were hosting campus visitors and assisting the university&#x27;s president.

In this respect, Blue Key was given the task of planning and executing homecoming activities that year and has continued to lead this activity ever since. Also included in the 1923 Homecoming was Dad&#x27;s Day, a time for parents to visit and acquaint themselves with campus life. Dad&#x27;s Day and Homecoming were held concurrently until the 1930s.

The organization quickly became so popular that Blue Key spread to colleges and universities across the country. Initially, membership in the organization was &quot;ex officio&quot;; a student automatically belonged to the organization if he held one of the major student organization positions on campus.

In the 1920s, the University of Florida was the state&#x27;s only institution of higher learning where a white male could continue his education. During the same time, the leadership of the state was male, predominantly those from Florida. If one of those leaders were college educated, it was most likely he went to the University of Florida and, to a large measure, it was consistent that student leaders at the University of Florida would likely remain in Florida and would assume roles of leadership within the professional, political, governmental, business, education cultural, religious, and social life of the state. The networking of those students with each other, and with other alumni of the institution, provided a powerful force and unique opportunity for service to the University of Florida. While Florida Blue Key membership offered many opportunities for service to the University, it also provided opportunities for personal enhancement and advancement. Many doors were opened to young college graduates whose resume included membership in Florida Blue Key.

===Separation with national chapters===

The concept of a group of student leaders pooling their talents and interests to plan and promote a major event for their campus was a popular idea. Through Dean Riley&#x27;s travels and professional contacts, similar organizations were developed on other campuses and it wasn&#x27;t long before it seemed appropriate to organize into a national group.

For a variety of reasons, the University of Florida chapter decided not to be part of the national organization with the issue coming to a decision point 1932 and 1935. The Florida group thought the proposed constitution of the national organization took too much control from the hands of the students; and it disagreed with some specific tenets of membership, including the requirement of a 2.5 grade point average. The Florida group believed the organization was not an academic one but, rather, a leadership and service group; thus, if one was progressing satisfactorily toward a degree (i.e. 2.0), one should be eligible for membership. Since then, Florida Blue Key has changed its stance on the grade point average requirement, now requiring a 2.75 GPA in order to be tapped.

The Blue Key Honor Society came into being and is a very respected national organization with chapters on many campuses throughout the country. Florida Blue Key was also formed as an organization only to be found at the University of Florida. The dispute was a clear indication that FBK did not intend to serve as a passive honor for University of Florida students, but rather as an active force in shaping the events of the university and state.

The parting of the ways between the parent chapter and other chapters forming the national organization left deep wounds on many Florida students. The perceptions of the conflict being a very important part of any subsequent discussions about the organization for years to come; including discussions of orientation of new members. The active members at that time wanted nothing to do with the national organization once it was founded, and, further, wanted to be sure that their successors would not become involved in it. Examples of such feelings are expressed in the last sentence of the Oath of Membership in Florida Blue Key and the Constitution. Through the 1940s, the orientation of new members included hours on the discussion of this topic.

Today, the memory of this separation is still discussed in orientation, but only for the purposes of relating its historical significance and for emphasizing that Florida Blue Key is the name of the organization and that it has no relationship to, and is not part of, The Blue Key National Honor Society. A transfer student to the University of Florida often assumes his membership in a Blue Key National Honor Society chapter at another institution provides him with reciprocal membership in Florida Blue Key only to find out that is not the case. To this day, Florida Blue Key controls the use of all trademark and intellectual property rights related to Blue Key Honor Society. Furthermore, Blue Key Honor Society is prohibited from chartering or forming chapters at any institution within the State of Florida.

== Activities ==

Florida Blue Key continues to sponsor and organize the University of Florida&#x27;s annual homecoming celebration and Gator Growl. These events are widely recognized as the largest Homecoming celebration in the country, which has grown to encompass dozens of events and community activities throughout the fall semester.

Gator Growl is billed as the largest student-run pep rally in the world; an estimated 75,000 people have attended the event in past years. Gator Growl, nicknamed &quot;Growl&quot; by some students, usually features comedians such as Bill Cosby, Frank Thornton, and Dane Cook in addition to the school rallies, but occasionally a top-tier musical act headlines the show. The first Gator Growl occurred in 1932, and has been a tradition at the University of Florida for over 80 years.

The Blue Key Speech &amp; Debate Tournament, sponsored by FBK since the early 1980s, is one of the largest and most prestigious high school speech &amp; debate tournaments in the country.

Other activities include organizing UF&#x27;s Legal Day, sponsoring the Miss University of Florida pageant, lobbying efforts on behalf of the university, and various community debates regarding issues concerning Florida and UF.

==Notable members==

Members of Florida Blue Key include notable politicians and prominent business leaders.

==Controversies and scandals==

=== Grapski lawsuit ===
In 1995, Florida Blue Key was sued by graduate student Charles Grapski, who claimed that some of the organization&#x27;s members had defamed him during his candidacy for student body president. In his complaint, Grapski charged that several members of Florida Blue Key conspired to alter Grapski&#x27;s criminal record, adding a false charge of child molestation, and circulate it on campus.

According to a 1997 lawsuit by Charles Grapski, Florida Blue Key maintains tight control over the student government and University of Florida. Florida Blue Key was found guilty of defamation of character and conspiracy to defame, and held liable for damages of $250,000. Grapski eventually settled for $85,000, and Florida Blue Key has since claimed no liability.

==Influence on-campus and in politics==
Florida Blue Key&#x27;s control of politics has been compared to The Machine at the University of Alabama. For decades, members of Florida Blue Key have been the gatekeepers of student involvement on campus.

&quot;The Independent Florida Alligator&quot; wrote that &quot;For students aspiring to hold public office one day, the path seems simple,&quot; adding &quot;Go to UF. Get involved in Student Government. Get tapped to join Florida Blue Key. Make the right connections.&quot; The publication has also written that a &quot;fluid set of alliances governed by a select group of powerbrokers&quot; called the &quot;System&quot; hovers over Student Government and Florida Blue Key, stating that the System assigns power to a small group of campus leaders who have a decisive influence on who gets tapped to join Florida Blue Key, among other things. &quot;The Tampa Bay Times&quot; has similarly written that &quot;Campus politics in Gainesville have long been controlled by a powerful few with the help of a voting bloc made up of social sororities and fraternities. Much of the power-brokering occurs in a highly selective organization called Florida Blue Key.&quot;

Criticism of FBK has propped up, with the organization being accused of intentionally tapping fewer individuals affiliated with multicultural communities. Wesley Maul, a former FBK President has addressed these concerns stating, &quot;Many Florida students hold positions of responsibility and leadership throughout campus and the Gainesville community, but merely holding such a position doesn&#x27;t insure [sic] membership in Florida Blue Key.&quot; Maul also stated that FBK members are concerned with the diversity of the organization.

Off-campus, Florida Blue Key has also been cited to have an influence in Florida&#x27;s state politics, with &quot;Florida Trend&quot; writing in 2004 that, in the past, &quot;the doors to the governor&#x27;s mansion, Legislature and judiciary in Florida all seemed to unlock with a Blue Key.&quot; Then-U.S. Representative Adam Putnam stated, &quot;Anybody who was anybody in Florida politics had been in Florida Blue Key -- and not just politics but business, the law, agriculture.&quot; Putnam also called FBK &quot;probably more political than the Florida Legislature,&quot; and &quot;outstanding preparation for political campaigning, the good and the bad.&quot;

<text>Michael John Keane (born May 29, 1967) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey winger. Undrafted, Keane played over 1,100 games in the National Hockey League from 1988 until 2004. He then played five seasons for his hometown Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League until he retired in 2010. Keane is a three-time Stanley Cup champion, having won with the Montreal Canadiens in 1993, Colorado Avalanche in 1996, and the Dallas Stars in 1999. He is one of only 11 players in NHL history to win the Cup with three or more different teams. On September 3, 2013, the Winnipeg Jets announced the hiring of Keane as Assistant of Player Development.

==Playing career==
Keane began his junior hockey career in the Junior A Manitoba Junior Hockey League (MJHL) with the Winnipeg South Blues. He then joined the major junior ranks in the Western Hockey League (WHL) with the Moose Jaw Warriors. Undrafted out of junior, Keane signed as a free agent on September 25, 1985, with the Montreal Canadiens and started his NHL career in 1988. He helped the Canadiens to a Stanley Cup championship in 1993, his fifth NHL season. He spent eight seasons in Montreal and was captain of the team from April 1995 to December 1995. After Kirk Muller was traded near the end of the 1994–95 season, Keane was named as the 24th captain of the Montreal Canadiens. Keane was subject to media scrutiny after speaking to Mathias Brunet of &quot;La Presse&quot; (a French language newspaper). Keane declared that he had no intention of learning French. He drew controversy in the French media after saying he did not believe it was necessary to speak French, since players on the team spoke predominantly English.

During the 1995–96 NHL season, Keane was traded along with Patrick Roy to the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for Jocelyn Thibault, Andrei Kovalenko, and Martin Ručinský. He won his second Stanley Cup that season, helping the Avalanche defeat the Florida Panthers in four games in the Finals. Keane spent another season with the Avalanche, before becoming a free agent in the summer of 1997. He signed with the New York Rangers, where he played for half a season before the Rangers traded Keane, Brian Skrudland, and the Rangers&#x27; 1998 6th round draft choice (Pavel Patera) to the Dallas Stars in exchange for Todd Harvey, Bob Errey, and the Stars&#x27; 1998 4th round draft choice (Boyd Kane). Keane played in Dallas until 2000–01, helping the Stars win the Stanley Cup in 1999 and returning to the finals the next year. He started the 2001–02 NHL season with the St. Louis Blues but finished that season back with Colorado. Keane stayed in Colorado until he left for the Vancouver Canucks at the start of the 2003–04 NHL season.

After the 2004–05 lockout, Keane signed with his hometown team, the Manitoba Moose, for the 2005–06 AHL season. Keane played five seasons for the Moose. He was named captain in 2005 and remained Manitoba&#x27;s captain until July 20, 2010, when his contract was not renewed. Keane was also captain of the AHL All-Star Team Canada in 2007. Keane&#x27;s number 12 jersey was retired February 12, 2011, when the Manitoba Moose took on the San Antonio Rampage at Bell MTS Place. Keane&#x27;s number was the first number retired in Manitoba Moose history.

==International play==
Keane competed for Team Canada at the 1987 World Junior Championships in Czechoslovakia. While playing for the gold medal against the Soviet Union, both teams were disqualified as a result of the infamous Punch-up in Piestany.

<text>Kirk Christopher Muller (born February 8, 1966) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre and current assistant coach with the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League (NHL). He played in the NHL for 19 seasons from 1984–85 until 2002–03 with the Dallas Stars, Florida Panthers, New Jersey Devils, New York Islanders, Toronto Maple Leafs and won the Stanley Cup in 1993 as member of the Montreal Canadiens. Muller also previously served as head coach of the Carolina Hurricanes from 2011 to 2014, and was an associate coach with the Canadiens from 2016 to 2021 following a previous stint as assistant coach with the team between 2006–2011.

==Playing career==
Muller started his junior career with the Kingston Canadians of the Ontario Hockey League, but his most successful junior seasons were with the Guelph Platers. There was a dispute in 1984 between the Platers and the Canadian Olympic Team, who wanted Muller to play with them at the 1984 Winter Olympics. The Platers owner was upset over losing Muller for so much time, but eventually they came to an agreement and Muller played in the Olympics. He was drafted second overall by the New Jersey Devils in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft behind Mario Lemieux. &quot;Captain Kirk&quot; was the heart and soul of the Devils franchise, with his intensity and strong two-way play. However, although New Jersey had a surprisingly successful run in the 1988 playoffs, they never became a serious Stanley Cup contender while Muller was with them. After walking out of training camp on September 16, 1991, over a contract dispute, he was traded along with Roland Melanson to the Montreal Canadiens for Stéphane Richer and Tom Chorske on September 20.

Muller quickly became a fan favourite in Montreal, and he helped them win the Stanley Cup in 1993. He was traded to the New York Islanders during the 1994–95 NHL season. Initially, he was reluctant to report to the Islanders, then played a handful of games in an uninterested manner before team management decided that his poor attitude outweighed his potential contributions on the ice and barred him from the team. Eventually, the Islanders recalled Muller, but he refused to report, freeing the Islanders from their contractual obligations to pay him. Ultimately, Muller was traded at a discount to the Toronto Maple Leafs, in a three team trade that saw Muller and Don Beaupre go to the Maple Leafs, Martin Straka, Ken Belanger and the rights to Bryan Berard go to the Islanders while Damian Rhodes and the rights to Wade Redden went to the Ottawa Senators. Muller had his last 20 goal season with the Maple Leafs the next season, but he was traded to the Florida Panthers for prospect Jason Podollan as the Leafs fell out of the playoff picture.

Muller struggled in Florida, scoring just four goals in the whole 1998–99 NHL season. His last break came when he signed with the Dallas Stars in the middle of the 1999–2000 season. Even though his scoring touch of old almost completely evaporated, he still managed to be a strong role player with the Stars for four seasons and was part of the &quot;grumpy old men&quot; line that included Mike Keane and John MacLean. He retired at the end of the 2002–03 season.

Muller played in 6 NHL All-Star Games (1985, 1986, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1993.)

==Coaching career==
Muller began his coaching career with the Queen&#x27;s University Golden Gaels in his hometown of Kingston. During 2005-06, Muller&#x27;s Golden Gaels posted an 8-13-1-2 record in the Ontario University Athletics Conference.

Muller also held the title of assistant coach to Marc Habscheid with Team Canada, winning the gold medal at the 2005 Lotto Cup Tournament in Slovakia. In March 2006, he served as assistant coach to Greg Gilbert at the Under-18 World Championship.

Muller returned to the Montreal Canadiens on June 20, 2006, when he was named assistant coach of the Canadiens.

On June 27, 2011, the Nashville Predators announced that Muller had been hired as the head coach of their AHL affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals. On November 28, 2011, Muller became coach of the Carolina Hurricanes, taking over for Paul Maurice. On May 5, 2014, Muller was relieved of his coaching duties by the Carolina Hurricanes. On May 13, 2014, Muller was signed by the St. Louis Blues as an assistant coach.

On June 2, 2016, the Montreal Canadiens rehired Muller as an associate coach.

On August 13, 2020, Muller temporarily replaced head coach Claude Julien who was hospitalized with chest pains.

On February 24, 2021, Muller along with head coach Claude Julien were fired from the Canadiens and former assistant coach Dominique Ducharme took over as interim head coach.

On June 10, 2021, Kirk Muller was named an associate coach for the Calgary Flames under head coach Darryl Sutter. He was named an assistant coach for the Washington Capitals on July 20, 2023.

<text>Odor-Eaters is an American brand of foot-care products designed to reduce foot odor. The line started with insoles that are made of latex and contain activated carbon, which neutralizes odors. , the brand is owned by Blistex Inc.

==History==
Odor-Eaters is an American brand of foot-care products designed to reduce foot odor. Herbert Lapidus invented the namesake insoles while employed as Combe Incorporated&#x27;s head of a research and development. The insoles are made of latex and contain activated carbon, which neutralizes odors. Combe already marketed Johnson&#x27;s Foot Soap, so it introduced the product under the Johnson&#x27;s brand in 1974.

Combe extended the brand beyond insoles to include odor-reducing foot sprays. In 1981, Combe licensed Chipman-Union to manufacture socks under the Odor-Eaters brand name. The socks contained an odor inhibiting agent that withstood laundering. Kmart and Walmart carried the socks. Production of the socks ended in 2011.

In January 2011, Combe sold its foot care product line to Blistex Inc.

== Sponsorship ==
In 1988, Combe took over sponsorship of a national Rotten Sneakers Contest to promote its Odor-Eaters brand. A Vermont sporting goods store owner originated the event in 1979, to advertise athletic shoes. Blistex continues to market the Odor-Eaters products and to sponsor the Rotten Sneakers Contest.

Formerly known as the International Youth Hostel Federation, Hostelling International has 60 member associations operating over 2,650 hostels around the world.

==Origins of the International Youth Hostel Federation==
Richard Schirrmann, a German schoolteacher, opened the first youth hostel on 1 June 1912 in Altena Castle, in northwest Germany, with the goal of providing affordable accommodation to youth travelling the country. More hostels were opened in Germany throughout the 1910s, and Schirrmann founded the German Youth Hostel Association in 1919.

Other countries in Europe adopted this concept, which led to the founding of the International Youth Hostel Federation (IYHF) in October 1932 in Amsterdam by representatives from Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Poland, Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Britain, Ireland, France, and Belgium. Schirrmann, who became president in 1933, resigned in 1936 when the Government of Nazi Germany forced him out while the hostels were put under control of the Hitler Youth.

Throughout the 1950s, the hostel concept spread to Asia, Africa, and Latin America. By 1977, the international hostel network had reached a total of 500 million overnight stays, and by 1997, it counted one billion stays.

IYHF began using the name Hostelling International in 2006. 

Youth hostels originally differed in setup from modern hostels, although the growing popularity of backpacking culture forced them to evolve. For example, in the UK, as in other countries, the practice of visitors completing daily chores and cleaning tasks as part of their stay was phased out during the 1980s.

==Modern organization==
When Hostelling International was founded, representatives agreed on the introduction of an international membership card and established minimum standards for hostels. Memberships are still required today and can be purchased either online, at a hostel, or at a National Youth Hostel Association office or membership-selling outlet. 

HI reports 37 million overnight stays annually, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization. 60 National Youth Hostel Associations are members of HI, with over 2,650 hostels worldwide.

Although HI holds charity status in the UK, not all member organizations share this status. For example, Hostelling International Canada lost its charity status in 2008, and the YHA in England and Wales considered commercializing in response to increased competition from independent hostels.

The COVID-19 pandemic (2019–2023) led some national associations, such as the Youth Hostel Association of New Zealand, to sell off properties due to financial impacts.

<text>Hailuoto (; ) is a Finnish island in the northern Baltic Sea and a municipality in Northern Ostrobothnia region. The population of Hailuoto is (), making it the smallest municipality in Northern Ostrobothnia and the former Oulu Province in terms of population. The municipality covers an area of (excluding sea areas) of which is inland water (). The population density is . Of all the Finnish sea islands, Hailuoto is the third largest after Fasta Åland and Kimitoön.

Hailuoto lies opposite the city of Oulu in the Gulf of Bothnia. The distance between Oulu and Hailuoto is , and the sea area between them is called &quot;Luodonselkä&quot; (literally &quot;open water of the islet&quot;).

Land in the region is constantly rising due to post-glacial rebound. It is estimated that the first parts of Hailuoto appeared from the Baltic Sea about 1700 years ago. The current island of Hailuoto was formed from many smaller islands. Two large sections, Santonen and Hanhinen merged into the main island (Luoto) only about two centuries ago. The island is continuously expanding and eventually it will join with the mainland. Kirkkosalmi, a wetland region between Hanhinen and Luoto is renowned for being an important bird refuge where rare bird species are observed.

The theme of the coat of arms of Hailuoto describes the economy of the island municipality; the explanation of the coat of arms is &quot;in a blue field with a silver rowlock.&quot; The coat of arms was designed by Teuvo-Pentti Pakkala and approved by the Hailuoto Municipal Council at its meeting on 28 April 1966. The Ministry of the Interior approved the use of the coat of arms on 19 December of the same year.

==History==
The permanent settlement of Hailuoto apparently began in the 12th century. Residents came from many directions, especially from Karelia. The Swedes, who competed for its fishing waters, gave the island the name &quot;Karelö&quot; (which was transformed into &quot;Karlö&quot;), which means freely translated &quot;Karelian Island&quot;. The first permanent residents of Hailuoto were mostly from Western Finland, but some also came from Eastern Finland. In 1548, there were 43 houses on the island, and by 1570 the number of houses had grown to 60. Queen Christina of Sweden donated the entire island of Hailuoto in 1652 to Colonel Berndt Taube, from whose heirs it was returned to the crown in 1675.

Hailuoto first belonged to the high parish of Saloinen (nowadays part of Raahe), from which it separated into an independent parish in 1587. The church, built in 1610–1620, was for a long time the oldest wooden church in use in Finland until it burned down in 1968. The current church was completed in 1972.

During the Great Famine of 1695–1697, 88 inhabitants of Hailuoto died. During the Great Northern War (1713–1721), 200 Cossacks of the Tsardom of Russia killed about 800 people in Hailuoto with axes on 29 September 1714. Many of the victims had sought protection on the island, as Hailuoto had a population of less than 300 at that time. The bloodshed done overnight was the greatest of the Great Northern War. According to tradition, the bells of Hailuoto Church were drowned in Lake Kirkonjärvi during the Great Northern War, where they were never found again.

==Geography and nature==

Hailuoto is the largest island in the Gulf of Bothnia, consisting of four parts, Luoto, Santonen, Hanhinen and Syökari. They were still separated a couple of centuries ago until they joined together as a result of crustal rebound. The young surface forms of the island are shaped throughout by sea waves, currents, ice thrust and wind.

The soil consists of sandy materials, which are partly derived from clay sandstone, which is called The formation of Muhos extends to Hailuoto. A 15-kilometer-long grayling ridge runs through the island from Hyypänmäki to Marjaniemi in a north-east-southwest direction. In the eastern parts of Hyypänmäki, the meltwater of the glacier has broken up the sand into a plateau almost two kilometers wide. In the central parts, Harju runs only a few ten-meter-wide high ridges, but spreads west from Isomäki again. The quarry Marjaniemi tip is a wear residue of the heart of the ridge. The highest point is Hyypänmäki which is about 31 meters above sea level. There are also rocks in the Hyypänmäki area, which are later covered with dry quicksand. The rocks show that the waves washed the shores of the islands, but the cliff ramparts also show that the drift ice pushed violently against the shores. Aerial sand dikes and shore dikes are a special feature that characterizes the surface forms of Hailuoto, especially on the north and west coasts.

The most diverse part of Hailuoto&#x27;s vegetation is spread on the shores, especially in the coastal meadows of sheltered coves. In forest nature, dry pine barrens are well represented. Extensive lichen fabrics are particularly characteristic. Hailuoto, a bird research site, has a long tradition. Waterfowl are most abundant in meadows, extensive shallows, reefs and lush bays. The highlight of the fall is the migration of swans, which culminates in one and a half thousand birds resting on the shores.

In November 2019, a rare phenomenon was observed on the shores of Marjaniemi in Hailuoto, when thousands of &quot;egg-shaped&quot; sea ice had accumulated on the shore. BBC Weather expert George Goodfellow explained the reason for the phenomenon: &quot;The general picture is that they form from pieces of larger ice sheet which then get jostled around by waves, making them rounder. They can grow when sea water freezes on to their surfaces and this also helps to make them smoother. So the result is a ball of smooth ice which can then get deposited on to a beach, either blown there or getting left there when the tide goes out.&quot;

==Services==
In the center village of Hailuoto there is a comprehensive school, two grocery stores (K-Market and Sale), a bank (Osuuspankki), a barber shop and a filling station (SEO).

The Arctic Light House Hotel for tourists is located right next to the Marjaniemi Lighthouse.

==Religion==

According to the 2018 regional division, the only parishes in the municipality are the Hailuoto Parish of the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church and the Oulu Orthodox Parish of the Finnish Orthodox Church. Of the revival movements within the church, Conservative Laestadianism operates in the locality, which has the Hailuoto Peace Association (&quot;Hailuodon Rauhanyhdistys&quot;).

==Culture==
The entire island of Hailuoto is classified as one of Finland&#x27;s nationally significant built cultural environments. The unique landscape and natural conditions have made Hailuoto, the largest island in the Bay of Bothnia, one of Finland&#x27;s national landscapes.

===Food===
In the 1980s, fish potatoes made from European whitefish were named traditional food of the Hailuoto parish.

==Transportation==

A ferry operates regularly between Hailuoto and Oulu&#x27;s suburb of Oulunsalo. In winter an official ice road, approximately long, connects the island to the mainland. The main road on the island is the regional road 816, which continue to the mainland towards the Kempele municipality via a ferry connection. Hailuoto also has a small airfield, Hailuoto Airfield, about south of central village.

A 8.4 km fixed link to connect Hailuoto to the mainland, consisting of a causeway with two 750 m bridges, was approved in 2015. The project was briefly halted due to environmental litigation, which was eventually denied in 2023. 

Actual construction work began in 2024, with an estimated opening of the causeway predicted by 2026.

<doc id="748016" wikidata="Q591569" url="?curid=748016" title="Macumba">
<text>Macumba () is a generic term for various Afro-Brazilian religions, the practitioners of which are then called macumbeiros. These terms are generally regarded as having negative connotations, comparable to an English term like &quot;black magic&quot;. In a broader sense, the term &quot;Macumba&quot; is used for most Afro-Brazilian religious traditions, including Candomblé and Umbanda. In a more limited sense, &quot;macumba&quot; is used only to characterize traditions like Quimbanda that revolve around the lesser &quot;exu&quot; spirits, especially as they are practiced in Rio de Janeiro. Some practitioners of Afro-Brazilian traditions call themselves &quot;macumbeiros&quot;, although in some instances this is done predominantly in jest.

== Etymology ==
There are debates regarding the etymological origins of the term &quot;Macumba&quot; and the matter remains unsettled. Some scholars have argued that &quot;Macumba&quot; derives from a Bantu language term for a type of percussion instrument. If so, the use of such instruments in the rituals of Bantu speakers brought to Brazil might have resulted in the word becoming associated with Afro-Brazilian religious traditions. An alternative argument, put forward by Marcos Aurélio Luz and Georges Lapassade, argued that &quot;macumba&quot; derived from
the term &quot;mocamba&quot;, which designated a house of runaway slaves.

==Definitions==

There are conflicting views as to what the term &quot;Macumba&quot; describes. The term is sometimes used as a colloquial term for all Afro-Brazilian religions. The scholar Stefania Capone noted that, when applied to Afro-Brazilian religions, &quot;Macumba&quot; can &quot;indicate anything to do with spirits&quot;.
In this, &quot;macumba&quot; is used in much the same way as the term &quot;calundu&quot;, which had been used in the 18th century to describe Afro-Brazilian traditions. 

In this sense, the term &quot;macumbeiros&quot; has sometimes been used for practitioners of Candomblé and Umbanda, two Afro-Brazilian religions that emerged in the 19th and early 20th centuries respectively. Writing in the 1990s, the anthropologist Robert A. Voeks noted that those who took an extremely negative view of Candomblé still viewed it as being &quot;impregnated with devil worship and macumba.&quot; The term &quot;macumba&quot; has also been historically used for Umbanda, and some Umbandists have referred to themselves as &quot;macumbeiros&quot;, often in jest due to the negative connotations of this term. At the same time, there are those taking a positive view of Candomblé and Umbanda who seek to distinguish these traditions from what they call &quot;macumba&quot;.

===Stricter sense===
Other definitions suggest a more restrictive use of the term. The scholar Kelly Hayes noted that while &quot;Macumba&quot; was &quot;a term used to denominate Afro-Brazilian religious cults, practices, and ritual objects&quot; as a whole, it was used &quot;most especially&quot; for &quot;those thought to involve &quot;feitiçaria&quot;, sorcery or black magic.&quot; The scholar Steven Engler noted that &quot;Macumba&quot; &quot;refers not to a specific religion but to a range of popular Afro-Brazilian rituals (often labeled &#x27;black magic&#x27;) that aim at healing and worldly benefits.&quot;

In particular the term has been used for those practitioners who cultivate relations with spirits referred to as &quot;exus&quot;; in Brazil, these are sometimes also called &quot;devils,&quot; while devotees call them &quot;povo da rua&quot;, people of the streets.&quot; In this sense, &quot;macumba&quot; is most associated with the area around Rio de Janeiro. Much of the specialist literature on the topic has identified that city as the home of Macumba, with some practitioners of Afro-Brazilian traditions in Rio referring to their practices as Macumba.

Hayes argued that the term effectively operated as a &quot;boundary marker within larger classificatory projects&quot;, one commonly used &quot;to determine legitimate forms of religious expression, establishing the boundaries of
religious authenticity, propriety, and morality.&quot; They noted that much literature sought to portray Candomblé as a legitimate religion of pure African derivation while simultaneously denigrating Macumba as &quot;especially syncretistic, impure, or degraded&quot;. This division is evident in the work of the sociologist Roger Bastide, who presented the Nago tradition of Candomblé, of which he was an initiate, as a legitimate religion, while dismissing the Bantu tradition of Candomblé as a form of &quot;Macumba&quot; that could only be labelled magic.

<text>Legnickie Pole (in 1945–1948 &quot;Dobre Pole&quot;) is a village in Legnica County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south-western Poland. It is the seat of the administrative district (gmina) called Gmina Legnickie Pole. It lies approximately southeast of Legnica, and west of the regional capital Wrocław.

== History ==

The territory became part of the emerging Polish state in the 10th century. The village was the site of the decisive Battle of Legnica during the first Mongol invasion of Poland on 9 April 1241. In the battle, Mongols led by Kadan and Baidar defeated a Polish army aided by western volunteers under command of Polish ruler Henry II the Pious. The Mongols annihilated their opponents and joined with the main army in Hungary, but upon receiving the news of the death of their Grand Khan Ögedei Khan, they turned back to attend to the election of a new Khagan, or Grand Khan.

As a result of the fragmentation of Poland into smaller duchies, the village was part of the Duchy of Silesia until 1248 and the Duchy of Legnica afterwards, remaining under the rule of the Piast dynasty until its extinction in 1675. Afterwards it was incorporated into the Habsburg-ruled Kingdom of Bohemia. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War the village was plundered by the Swedes.
The village was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia during the Silesian Wars in 1742. During the Napoleonic Wars, the Prussian general Prince Blücher defeated a French army under Marshal MacDonald at the Kaczawa river (then &quot;Katzbach&quot;), a small river running through Legnickie Pole (then &quot;Wahlstatt&quot;) and Legnica (then &quot;Liegnitz&quot;), in the Battle of Katzbach on 26 August 1813. In honor of this victory Blücher received the title &quot;Prince of Wahlstatt&quot; on 3 June 1814. A Baroque abbey built before the Prussian annexation, in 1727 through 1733, with its complex of attendant buildings became a Prussian training institute for cadets in 1840. Among others, future field marshal and German president Paul von Hindenburg studied here from 1859 to 1863, as did the &quot;Red Baron&quot;, Manfred von Richthofen, until 1911.

As the Treaty of Versailles limited the size of the German military, the abbey was turned into a boarding school for boys in 1920. Under Nazi Germany, from 1934 it was first a National Political Institute of Education, and during World War II it was the location of the Oflag VIII-F prisoner-of-war camp for French POWs, Yugoslav and Italian POWs from 1940 to 1942 before its relocation to Moravská Třebová. In March 1943, the Germans established the Oflag 64 POW camp for Yugoslav officers and Soviet enlisted men, which was relocated to Szubin in May 1943.

The village became again part of Poland following the Nazi Germany&#x27;s defeat in the war, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the 1980s. The German-speaking population was expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The village was given its current Polish name &quot;Legnickie Pole&quot; (&quot;Field of Legnica&quot;, from 1945 to 1948 it was named &quot;Dobre Pole&quot; [&quot;Good Field&quot;]).

<doc id="748018" wikidata="Q512902" url="?curid=748018" title="William Bates (physician)">
<text>William Horatio Bates (December 23, 1860 – July 10, 1931) was an American physician who practiced ophthalmology and developed what became known as the Bates method for better eyesight. The method was based in his theory that the eye does not focus by changing the power of the lens, but rather by elongating the eyeball through use of the extraocular oblique muscles; this model contradicted mainstream ophthalmology and optometry then and now.

==Career==
Bates graduated A.B. from Cornell University in 1881 and received his medical degree at Columbia University&#x27;s College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1885. He formulated a theory about vision health, and published the book &quot;&quot; in 1920, and the magazine from 1919 to 1930. Parts of Bates&#x27; approach to treating vision disorders were based on psychological principles that were contrary to many of the medical theories of the time and remain so. The Bates method still enjoys some limited acceptance as a modality of alternative medicine.

Bates treated many patients, who claimed to have been cured of vision defects, especially myopia. This brought him into conflict with his peers. He defended himself by claiming that other physicians were in thrall to the establishment.

==Bates&#x27; publications==

Because the copyrights have expired, the original version of &quot;Perfect Sight Without Glasses&quot; (or &quot;The Cure of Imperfect Sight by Treatment Without Glasses&quot;) is now in the public domain. In 1943, an abridged version was published under the title &quot;Better Eyesight Without Glasses&quot;, which removed some of the most controversial points, such as the claim that &quot;perfectly remembering black&quot; is a suitable substitute for anaesthesia, and recommendations to look at the sun.

==Disappearance==
On August 30, 1902, Bates wrote a letter to his wife while she was visiting her mother and sent her some books and instruments from his apartment. In the letter he said that he had been &quot;called out of town to some major operations&quot;, and would be accompanying an old student, Dr. Forche. Bates expressed excitement over the potential of receiving a large sum of money for this, and promised to write more details later. His wife received no further letters from him.

Six weeks later he was found to be working as an assistant in Charing Cross Hospital, London, after reportedly being first admitted as a patient. His wife then travelled there and found him in a nervous state suffering from apparent amnesia. She invited him to stay with her in the Savoy Hotel. Two days later, he disappeared again. His wife continued searching for him after his second disappearance, but subsequently died before finding him again.

In 1910, an old colleague of Bates, Dr. J. E. Kelly, was travelling through Grand Forks, North Dakota, where he encountered Bates practicing. He subsequently persuaded Bates to return to New York and share an office with him, where he is said to have &quot;worked as hard and as successfully as he had done before his original disappearance&quot;.

==Personal life==
William Horatio Bates was born on December 23, 1860, to Charles and Amelia Halsey Bates.

Bates was married three times. He first married Edith Kitchell in 1883, with whom he had a son: Charles Halsey Bates; Kitchell died in 1886. He then married Margaret Crawford, with whom he had a daughter, Milo Bates, and a son, William Crawford Bates. After being widowed again, in 1928 he married Emily C. Lierman, his long-time personal assistant.

His son, Charles Halsey Bates disappeared in August 1928.

Bates enjoyed playing tennis and was once the North Dakota State Champion. He was also an avid runner who enjoyed literature and astronomy.

He died on July 10, 1931, after a year-long illness. His will excluded his eldest son, who was still missing at the time.

==Discovery of the medical use of adrenaline==
Bates also discovered the astringent and haemostatic properties of the substance produced by the adrenal glands, and its value in medicine, especially in surgeries. The substance was later commercialized as adrenaline.

<doc id="748019" wikidata="Q161899" url="?curid=748019" title="Złotoryja">
<text>Złotoryja (; , ; Latin: &quot;Aureus Mons&quot;, &quot;Aurum&quot;) is a historic town in Lower Silesian Voivodeship in southwestern Poland, the administrative seat of Złotoryja County, and of the smaller Gmina Złotoryja. Złotoryja is the first town in Poland to be granted town privileges, in 1211. Since the Middle Ages, it was a centre of gold and copper mining. Złotoryja was also featured among the most beautiful towns in Poland due to its location and architectural heritage.

==Geography==

The town is located in the historic Lower Silesia region on the right bank of the Kaczawa river, about southwest of Legnica. In the south, the Kaczawskie Mountains stretch up to the Karkonosze range of the Western Sudetes. Currently Złotoryja has approximately 16,000 inhabitants and is one of the important centres of basalt mining.

==Town&#x27;s name==
During its long existence Złotoryja was referred to by various names. Since the Middle Ages it was referred to as either &quot;Aurum&quot; (Latin for &quot;gold&quot;), &quot;Aureus Mons&quot; (&quot;Golden Mountain&quot;), &quot;Goldberg&quot; (German for &quot;Golden Mountain&quot;) or by its Polish name. Złotoryja in Polish literally means &quot;gold-digging&quot;, referring to historic gold-panning sites on the Kaczawa river.

== Coat of arms and flag==
The coat of arms features a black eagle of the Silesian Piast dynasty standing over three green hills, with the golden background. Its heraldic blazon is &quot;Or, an eagle displayed sable on a base three-invected vert&quot;. It has been used since the 15th century.

The flag features both of the heraldic colours of the coat of arms. It consists of two stripes: golden (yellow) above green.

==History==
===Middle Ages===

In the early Middle Ages the region was inhabited by the tribe of Trzebowianie, one of the Polish tribes, and in the 10th century the area was included in the emerging Polish state.

In the late 12th century and early 13th century a small settlement of gold miners was founded on the slopes of Mount St. Nicholas (&quot;Góra św. Mikołaja&quot;), located at the shores of the Kaczawa river. The village grew rapidly and in 1211 it was documented as &quot;Aurum&quot; and vested with town rights according to Magdeburg law by the Piast duke Henry I the Bearded, the first city throughout then-fragmented Poland and plausibly the first Silesian town with German institutions and German settlers. Henry I financed the construction of the St. Mary&#x27;s Church, which was later expanded and is now one of the town&#x27;s landmarks. In the 13th century a Hospitaller and Franciscan monastery were founded in the town, which thus became one of the important cultural and religious centres of the region. During the first Mongol invasion of Poland, in 1241 many of the miners took part in the Battle of Legnica, where most of them died, but the mining quickly recovered.
During the ongoing fragmentation of Poland into smaller duchies, in 1248 the town was attached to the newly established Duchy of Legnica and in 1290 was granted with a privilege to trade salt, one of the most expensive and valuable minerals in the Middle Ages. In 1329, under the rule of Duke Bolesław III the Generous, the whole Duchy of Legnica became a fief of the Kingdom of Bohemia under King John the Blind, yet it retained its local self-government. During the 15th century Hussite Wars the town was captured by the Hussite forces in 1427, 1428 and 1431. It was severely pillaged, but it quickly recovered and the local city council decided to build city walls in order to spare the city such troubles in the future. Much of the mediaeval fortifications is preserved until today.

===Early modern period===

Although by the early 15th century most of the gold deposits were depleted, the town started to gain significant income from the nearby &quot;Via Regia&quot; trade route linking Wrocław with Leipzig. A brewery and several weavers shops were opened soon afterwards. In 1504 a school was opened by Hieronymus Aurimontanus. In 1522 the first Protestant priests arrived and soon afterwards the school was turned into a Latin, humanistic gymnasium, the first in Silesia. One of its rectors, Valentin Trozendorf, wanted to turn it into a university and these plans were approved by Duke Frederick II of Legnica; however the prince died soon afterwards and the town was struck by a severe fire in 1554, which made the plans obsolete. Nevertheless, the school attracted students from Silesia, Greater Poland and Bohemia.

In 1526 the town together with the rest of the Bohemian crown land of Silesia came under the suzerainty of the Austrian House of Habsburg. It remained part of the Piast-ruled Duchy of Legnica until 1675. Złotoryja/Goldberg continued to prosper until 1608, when the prosperity was stopped by a major flood that killed approx. 50 of the inhabitants and damaged large part of the city. Five years later, in 1613 the town yet again was struck by great fire that destroyed 571 houses. To help rebuild the town, in 1621 the duke of Legnica granted the right to mint coins, a privilege the town enjoyed for two years. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War Goldberg changed hands several times and suffered especially in 1633, when Albrecht von Wallenstein, a former pupil of the gymnasium, beleaguered the city. After the war Goldberg needed almost 100 years to recover. Duke Louis IV of Legnica granted new privileges aiming to help the town prosper through the development of cloth production.

After the dissolution of the Piast Duchy of Legnica in 1675, the town was integrated with the Bohemian (Czech) Kingdom. After it came under the authority of the Czech kings, in 1676 Leopold I confirmed all privileges, and in 1688 allowed the organization of an annual fair. In 1742 it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in the First Silesian War.

===Late modern period===
During the Napoleonic Wars and Polish national liberation fights, in May 1807, Polish uhlans passed through the town. In 1810 the Prussian administration closed down the Bernardine monastery. On August 26, 1813, the armies of French marshal Macdonald was defeated near the town by the forces of Prussian general von Blücher (see Combat of Goldberg).

In 1848 riots and looting took place, and in 1849 an epidemic broke out. Goldberg became part of the newly formed German Empire in 1871 and at the end of the 19th century the town started to recover after almost 200 years of crisis. In 1884 the town was connected to Liegnitz (Legnica) by a railroad, and by 1906 two additional lines were opened: to Świerzawa and Chojnów. In 1900 the first telephone line was started. At the same time various companies tried to recover the gold mining in and around the city, but the plans were soon abandoned. Instead the copper ore mines were opened, but they faced serious financial difficulties by the end of the 1920s. During the 1933 Reichstag elections about 25% of the inhabitants backed the Nazi Party.
===World War II and recent history===

During World War II, the Germans created two branches of the Stalag VIII-A prisoner-of-war camp and two forced labour camps in the town. Among the prisoners were mainly Poles, French and Italians. On 5 February 1945, a German-organized death march of Allied prisoners of war from the Stalag Luft 7 POW camp reached the town, and the POWs were afterwards transported in cattle wagons to the Stalag III-A camp in Luckenwalde. The town survived the war almost untouched. In February 1945 it was captured by the forces of the Red Army 2nd Ukrainian Front under Ivan Konev. Following the decisions of the Potsdam conference, in May it was transferred back to Poland and renamed by Poles to the historic Polish &quot;Złotoryja&quot;. By 1949 most of local German inhabitants either fled or were expelled per the Potsdam Agreement. A large number of them were admeasured to refugee camps and settled later, mostly in the federal state Northrhine-Westphalia in West Germany.

In the nearby villages of Wilków and Nowy Kościół two important copper mines were founded and a large number of local engineers also participated in the development of the industrial region of Legnica. However, in the early 1970s the mines were closed down because ore deposits of much higher quality were found around Lubin.

Many factories were founded, including a shoe factory, Christmas tree ornaments factory and a basalt mine. Since 1989 the town of Złotoryja started to look for its past. The historical old town was restored and the traditions of gold mining were started. In 1992 a local &quot;Polish Guild of Gold Prospectors&quot; was started, which ever since organises the Polish Gold Panning Championships. In 2000 World Championships were held there.

Currently the town is one of the main tourist centres of the area. The heavy industry is also playing an important part in the development of the area. The local quarries are ones of the most profitable in Poland and the Christmas tree ornaments factory is exporting millions of ornaments every year, mostly to Western Europe and the United States.

<doc id="748021" wikidata="Q1305044" url="?curid=748021" title="Timothy Bottoms">
<text>Timothy James Bottoms (born August 30, 1951) is an American actor and film producer. He is best known for playing the lead in &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; (1971); Sonny Crawford in &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; (1971), where he and his fellow co-stars, Cybill Shepherd and Jeff Bridges, rose to fame; and as James Hart, the first-year law student who battles with Prof. Kingsfield, in the film adaptation &quot;The Paper Chase&quot; (1973). He is also known for playing the main antagonist in the disaster film &quot;Rollercoaster&quot; (1977) and for playing President George W. Bush multiple times, including on the sitcom &quot;That&#x27;s My Bush!&quot;, the comedy film &quot;The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course&quot; and the docudrama &quot;DC 9/11: Time of Crisis&quot;.

==Early life==
Bottoms was born in Santa Barbara, California, the eldest of four sons of Betty (née Chapman) and James &quot;Bud&quot; Bottoms, a sculptor and art teacher.

He graduated from Santa Barbara High School in 1970. During his time there he gained acting and singing experience during various theater productions.

==Career==
Bottoms made his film debut in 1971 as Joe Bonham in Dalton Trumbo&#x27;s &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot;. The same year, he appeared alongside his brother Sam in &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;. (He portrayed the same character in the 1990 sequel &quot;Texasville&quot;). In 1973&#x27;s &quot;The Paper Chase&quot;, he starred as Harvard law student Hart facing the fearsome Professor Kingsfield (John Houseman). Among the other films he has appeared in are &quot;Love and Pain and the Whole Damn Thing &quot;(1973), &quot;The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder&quot; (1974), &quot;Operation Daybreak&quot; (1975), &quot;A Small Town in Texas&quot; (1976), &quot;Rollercoaster&quot; (1977) &quot;Hurricane&quot; (1979), &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot; (1986) and &quot;Elephant &quot;(2003).

As a result of both a physical resemblance to U.S. President George W. Bush and an ability to impersonate his voice, Bottoms has portrayed Bush in three widely varying productions. In 2000 and 2001, he played a parody of Bush in the Comedy Central sitcom &quot;That&#x27;s My Bush!&quot;; he subsequently appeared as Bush in a cameo appearance in the family film &quot;The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course&quot;. Finally, following the September 11 attacks, Bottoms once again played Bush, this time in a serious fashion, in the TV film &quot;DC 9/11: Time of Crisis&quot;, one of the first films to be based upon the attacks.

During an episode of the Fox television show &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; in which a tornado warning has been issued and the students of the high school are trapped, Bottoms is seen as the panicking principal. He appeared in a recurring role during the first season of the FX series &quot;Dirt&quot; as Gibson Horne, owner of the magazine for whom the main character Lucy Spiller, played by Courteney Cox, worked.

He also co-produced the documentary &quot;Picture This – The Times of Peter Bogdanovich in Archer City, Texas&quot; (1991), a behind-the-scenes work about the making of the films &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; and &quot;Texasville&quot;. In the documentary, he revealed that he had a crush on his co-star Cybill Shepherd during &quot;The Last Picture Show,&quot; but she did not reciprocate his romantic feelings, even though she said in a separate interview that she found him &quot;very attractive&quot;. He was also heavily featured in the Metallica video for &quot;One&quot;, which featured footage of the film &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot;.
In 2023, Bottoms released a novel entitled The Pier. The story follows a young boy out fishing for a day and the people and situations he encounters. The book was published by Tall Tales Press. 

==Personal life==
He is the eldest brother of actors Joseph Bottoms, Sam Bottoms, and Ben Bottoms. 

Bottoms has been married twice, first to singer Alicia Cory in 1975. They had a son before divorcing in 1982. His marriage to Marcia Morehart in 1984 produced three children.

<doc id="748026" wikidata="Q33291" url="?curid=748026" title="Fon language">
<text>Fon (, ) also known as Dahomean is the language of the Fon people. It belongs to the Gbe group within the larger Atlantic–Congo family. It is primarily spoken in Benin, as well as in Nigeria and Togo by approximately 2.28 million speakers. Like the other Gbe languages, Fon is an isolating language with a SVO basic word order.

== Cultural and legal status ==
In Benin, French is the official language, and Fon and other indigenous languages, including Yom and Yoruba, are classified as national languages.

==Dialects==
The standardized Fon language is part of the Fon cluster of languages inside the Eastern Gbe languages. Hounkpati B Christophe Capo groups Agbome, Kpase, Gun, Maxi and Weme (Ouémé) in the Fon dialect cluster, although other clusterings are suggested. Standard Fon is the primary target of language planning efforts in Benin, although separate efforts exists for Gun, Gen, and other languages of the country.
==Phonology==
=== Vowels ===
Fon has seven oral vowel phonemes and five nasal vowel phonemes.
=== Consonants ===

 occurs only in linguistic mimesis and loanwords but is often replaced by in the latter, as in &quot;cɔ́fù&quot; &#x27;shop&#x27;. Several of the voiced occlusives occur only before oral vowels, and the homorganic nasal stops occur only before nasal vowels, which indicates that and are allophones. is in free variation with and so Fong can be argued to have no phonemic nasal consonants, a pattern rather common in West Africa. is nasalized (to ) before nasal vowels, and may assimilate to before . is sometimes also nasalized.

The only consonant clusters in Fon have or as the second consonant. After (post)alveolars, is optionally realized as : &quot;&quot; &#x27;to wash&#x27;, &#x27;to catch&#x27;, &#x27;to want&#x27;.

=== Tone ===
Fon has two phonemic tones: high and low. High is realized as rising (low–high) after a voiced consonant. Basic disyllabic words have all four possibilities: high–high, high–low, low–high, and low–low.

In longer phonological words, such as verb and noun phrases, a high tone tends to persist until the final syllable, which, if it has a phonemic low tone, becomes falling (high–low). Low tones disappear between high tones, but their effect remains as a downstep. Rising tones (low–high) simplify to high after high (without triggering downstep) and to low before high.

In Ouidah, a rising or falling tone is realized as a mid tone. For example, &#x27;we, you&#x27;, phonemically high-tone but phonetically rising because of the voiced consonant, is generally mid-tone in Ouidah.

==Orthographies==
===Roman alphabet===
The Fon alphabet is based on the Latin alphabet, with the addition of the letters Ɖ/ɖ, Ɛ/ɛ, and Ɔ/ɔ, and the digraphs gb, hw, kp, ny, and xw.
====Tone marking====
Tones are marked as follows:

* Acute accent marks the rising tone: xó, dó
* Grave accent marks the falling tone: ɖò, akpàkpà
* Caron marks falling and rising tone: bǔ, bǐ
* Circumflex accent marks the rising and falling tone: côfù
* Macron marks the neutral tone: kān

Tones are fully marked in reference books, but not always marked in other writing. The tone marking is phonemic, and the actual pronunciation may be different according to the syllable&#x27;s environment.

===Gbékoun script===
Speakers in Benin also use a distinct script called Gbékoun that was invented by Togbédji Adigbè.
It has 24 consonants and 9 vowels, as it is intended to transcribe all the languages of Benin.

== Sample text ==
From the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
:Translation
:All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

== Use ==
Radio programs in Fon are broadcast on ORTB channels.

Television programs in Fon are shown on the La Beninoise satellite TV channel.

French used to be the only language of education in Benin, but in the second decade of the twenty-first century, the government is experimenting with teaching some subjects in Benin schools in the country&#x27;s local languages, among them Fon.

== Machine translation efforts ==
There is an effort to create a machine translator for Fon (to and from French), by Bonaventure Dossou (from Benin) and Chris Emezue (from Nigeria). Their project is called FFR. It uses phrases from Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses sermons as well as other biblical phrases as the research corpus to train a Natural Language Processing (NLP) neural net model.

<doc id="748038" wikidata="Q29630" url="?curid=748038" title="Myostatin">
<text>Myostatin (also known as growth differentiation factor 8, abbreviated GDF8) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the &quot;MSTN&quot; gene. Myostatin is a myokine that is produced and released by myocytes and acts on muscle cells to inhibit muscle growth. Myostatin is a secreted growth differentiation factor that is a member of the TGF beta protein family.

Myostatin is assembled and produced in skeletal muscle before it is released into the blood stream. Most of the data regarding the effects of myostatin comes from studies performed on mice.

Animals either lacking myostatin or treated with substances that block the activity of myostatin have significantly more muscle mass.
Furthermore, individuals who have mutations in both copies of the myostatin gene (popularly—but inaccurately—called the &quot;Hercules gene&quot;) have significantly more muscle mass and are stronger than normal. There is hope that studies into myostatin may have therapeutic application in treating muscle wasting diseases such as muscular dystrophy.

==Discovery and sequencing==
The gene encoding myostatin was discovered in 1997 by geneticists Se-Jin Lee and Alexandra McPherron who produced a knockout strain of mice that lack the gene, and have approximately twice as much muscle as normal mice. These mice were subsequently named &quot;mighty mice&quot;.

Naturally occurring deficiencies of myostatin of various sorts have been identified in some breeds of cattle, sheep, whippets, and humans. In each case the result is a dramatic increase in muscle mass.

==Structure and mechanism of action==

Human myostatin consists of two identical subunits, each consisting of 109 (NCBI database claims human myostatin is 375 residues long) amino acid residues [note the full length gene encodes a 375AA prepro-protein which is proteolytically processed to its shorter active form]. Its total molecular weight is 25.0 kDa. The protein is inactive until a protease cleaves the NH2-terminal, or &quot;pro-domain&quot; portion of the molecule, resulting in the active COOH-terminal dimer. Myostatin binds to the activin type II receptor, resulting in a recruitment of either coreceptor Alk-3 or Alk-4. This coreceptor then initiates a cell signaling cascade in the muscle that includes the activation of transcription factors in the SMAD family—SMAD2 and SMAD3. These factors then induce myostatin-specific gene regulation. When applied to myoblasts, myostatin inhibits their proliferation and either initiates differentiation or stimulates quiescence.

In mature muscle, myostatin inhibits Akt, a kinase that is sufficient to cause muscle hypertrophy, in part through the activation of protein synthesis while stimulating the production of ubiquitin ligases, proteins that regulate muscle protein breakdown. However, Akt is not responsible for all of the observed muscle hypertrophic effects, which are mediated by myostatin inhibition. Thus myostatin acts in two ways: by inhibiting Akt-induced protein synthesis and stimulating ubiquitin-regulated protein degradation.

== Biological advantage ==
Many different mammalian and avian species produce myostatin, indicating that the ability to produce myostatin was positively selected for.

==Effects in animals==

=== Mutations ===
Mutations in myostatin do more than just affect the amount of muscle mass an organism can produce; they also have variable effects on other phenotypes for different species.For example, a Belgian Blue bovine with a mutation that inhibits myostatin production will exhibit a dramatic increase in muscle mass but will also lead to dystocia. Other species with myostatin deficiency mutation such as humans or Whippet dogs do not get obstructed labor.

===Double-muscled cattle===

After the discovery of the gene encoding myostatin in 1997, several laboratories cloned and established the nucleotide sequence of a myostatin gene in two breeds of cattle, Belgian Blue and Piedmontese. They found mutations in the myostatin gene (various mutations in each breed) which in one way or another lead to absence of functional myostatin. Unlike mice with a damaged myostatin gene, in these cattle breeds, muscle cells multiply rather than enlarge. People describe these cattle breeds as &quot;double-muscled&quot;, but the total increase in all muscles is no more than 40%.

Animals lacking myostatin or animals treated with substances such as follistatin that block the binding of myostatin to its receptor have significantly larger muscles. Thus, reduction of myostatin could potentially benefit the livestock industry, with even a 20 percent reduction in myostatin levels potentially having a large effect on the development of muscles.

However, the animal breeds developed as homozygous for myostatin deficiency have reproduction issues due to their unusually heavy and bulky offspring, and require special care and a more expensive diet to achieve a superior yield. This negatively affects economics of myostatin-deficient breeds to the point where they do not usually offer an obvious advantage. While hypertrophic meat (e.g. from Piedmontese beef) has a place on the specialist market due to its high palatability and tenderness, at least for purebred myostatin-deficient strains the expenses and (especially in cattle) necessity of veterinary supervision place them at a disadvantage in the bulk market.

===Whippets===
Whippets can have a mutation of the myostatin which involves a two-base-pair deletion, and results in a truncated, and likely inactive, myostatin protein.

Animals with a homozygous deletion have an unusual body shape, with a broader head, pronounced overbite, shorter legs, and thicker tails, and are called &quot;bully whippets&quot; by the breeding community. Although significantly more muscular, they are less able runners than other whippets. However, whippets that were heterozygous for the mutation were significantly over-represented in the top racing classes. In 2015 scientist used CRISPR/Cas9 to have the same homozygous deletion in Beagles that appears in &quot;bully whippets&quot;.

=== Mice ===
Mice that produce large amounts of myostatin exhibit a significant loss of skeletal muscle and body fat compared to normal mice. Comparatively, mice that produced decreased levels of myostatin had more muscle mass, less adipose tissue, and were double the size of wild type mice.

===Rabbits and goats===
In 2016, the CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to genetically engineer rabbits and goats with no functional copies of the myostatin gene. In both cases the resulting animals were significantly more muscular. However, rabbits without myostatin also exhibited an enlarged tongue, a higher rate of still births, and a reduced lifespan.

===Pigs===
A South Korean-Chinese team has engineered &quot;double muscle&quot; pigs, as with cattle, aiming for cheaper breeds for the meat market. Similar health problems have resulted as with other mammals, such as birthing difficulties due to excessive size.

===Fish===
Myostatin-disabled red sea breams grow to 1.2 the natural average size with the same amount of food and are sold as food in Japan by a startup.

==Clinical significance==

===Mutations===
A technique for detecting mutations in myostatin variants has been developed. Mutations that reduce the production of functional myostatin lead to an overgrowth of muscle tissue. Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy has an incomplete autosomal dominance pattern of inheritance. People with a mutation in both copies of the &quot;MSTN&quot; gene in each cell (homozygotes) have significantly increased muscle mass and strength. People with a mutation in one copy of the &quot;MSTN&quot; gene in each cell (heterozygotes) have increased muscle bulk, but to a lesser degree.

===In humans===
In 2004, a German boy was diagnosed with a mutation in both copies of the myostatin-producing gene, making him considerably stronger than his peers. His mother has a mutation in one copy of the gene.

An American boy born in 2005 was diagnosed with a clinically similar condition, but with a somewhat different cause: his body produces a normal level of functional myostatin, but because he is stronger and more muscular than most others his age, a defect in his myostatin receptors is thought to prevent his muscle cells from responding normally to myostatin. He appeared on the television show &quot;World&#x27;s Strongest Toddler&quot;.

===Therapeutic potential===
Further research into myostatin and the myostatin gene may lead to therapies for muscular dystrophy. The idea is to introduce substances that block myostatin. A monoclonal antibody specific to myostatin increases muscle mass in mice and monkeys.

A two-week treatment of normal mice with soluble activin type IIB receptor, a molecule that is normally attached to cells and binds to myostatin, leads to a significantly increased muscle mass (up to 60%). It is thought that binding of myostatin to the soluble activin receptor prevents it from interacting with the cell-bound receptors. In September 2020 scientists reported that suppressing activin type 2 receptors-signalling proteins myostatin and activin A via activin A/myostatin inhibitor ACVR2B – tested preliminarily in humans in the form of ACE-031 in the early 2010s – can protect against both muscle and bone loss in mice. The mice were sent to the International Space Station and could largely maintain their muscle weights – about twice those of wild type due to genetic engineering for targeted deletion of the myostatin gene – under microgravity.
Treating progeric mice with soluble activin receptor type IIB before the onset of premature ageing signs appear to protects against muscle loss and delay age related signs in other organs.

It remains unclear as to whether long-term treatment of muscular dystrophy with myostatin inhibitors is beneficial, as the depletion of muscle stem cells could worsen the disease later on. , no myostatin-inhibiting drugs for humans are on the market. An antibody genetically engineered to neutralize myostatin, stamulumab, which was under development by pharmaceutical company Wyeth, is no longer under development. Some athletes, eager to get their hands on such drugs, turn to the internet where fake &quot;myostatin blockers&quot; are being sold.

Resistance exercise and creatine supplementation lead to greater decreases in myostatin levels.

Myostatin levels can be temporarily reduced using a cholesterol-conjugated siRNA gene knockdown.

===Athletic use===
Inhibition of myostatin leads to muscle hypertrophy. Myostatin inhibitors can improve athletic performance and therefore there is a concern these inhibitors might be abused in the field of sports. However, studies in mice suggest that myostatin inhibition does not directly increase the strength of individual muscle fibers. Myostatin inhibitors are specifically banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). In an August 12, 2012, interview with NPR, Carlon Colker stated &quot;when the myostatin inhibitors come along, they&#x27;ll be abused. There&#x27;s no question in my mind.&quot;

=== Lifestyle effects on myostatin ===
Myostatin expression is decreased in physically active individuals, while obesity is linked to having a higher level myostatin as well as plasma in circulation.

==Effects==
===On bone formation===
Due to myostatin&#x27;s ability to inhibit muscle growth, it can indirectly inhibit bone formation by decreasing the load on the bone. It has a direct signalling effect on bone formation as well as degradation. Knockdown of myostatin has been shown to reduce formation of osteoclasts (multinucleated cells responsible for the breakdown of bone tissue) in mice modeling rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that, among other effects, leads to the degradation of the bone tissue in affected joints. Myostatin has not, however, been shown to be solely sufficient for the formation of mature osteoclasts from macrophages, only an enhancer.

Myostatin expression is increased around the site of a fracture. Suppression of myostatin at the fracture site leads to increased callus and overall bone size, further supporting the inhibitory effect of myostatin on bone formation. One study by Berno Dankbar et al., 2015 found that myostatin deficiency leads to a notable reduction in inflammation around a fracture site. Myostatin affects osteoclastogenesis by binding to receptors on osteoclastic macrophages and causing a signalling cascade. The downstream signalling cascade enhances the expression of RANKL-dependent integrin αvβ3, DC-STAMP, calcitonin receptors, and NFATc1 (which is part of the initial intracellular complex that starts the signaling cascade, along with R-Smad2 and ALK4 or ALK5).

An association between osteoporosis, another disease characterized by the degradation of bony tissue, and sarcopenia, the age-related degeneration of muscle mass and quality have also been found. Whether this link is a result of direct regulation or a secondary effect through muscle mass is not known.

A link in mice between the concentration of myostatin in the prenatal environment and the strength of offspring&#x27;s bones, partially counteracting the effects of osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease) has been found. Osteogenesis imperfecta is due to a mutation that causes the production of abnormal Type I collagen. Mice with defective myostatin were created by replacing sequences coding for the C-terminal region of myostatin with a neomycin cassette, rendering the protein nonfunctional. By crossbreeding mice with the abnormal Type I collagen and those with the knockout myostatin, the offspring had &quot;a 15% increase in torsional ultimate strength, a 29% increase in tensile strength, and a 24% increase in energy to failure&quot; of their femurs as compared to the other mice with osteogenesis imperfecta, showing the positive effects of decreased myostatin on bone strength and formation.

===On the heart===
Myostatin is expressed at very low levels in cardiac myocytes. Although its presence has been noted in cardiomyocytes of both fetal and adult mice, its physiological function remains uncertain. However, it has been suggested that fetal cardiac myostatin may play a role in early heart development.

Myostatin is produced as promyostatin, a precursor protein kept inactive by the latent TGF-β binding protein 3 (LTBP3). Pathological cardiac stress promotes N-terminal cleavage by furin convertase to create a biologically active C-terminal fragment. The mature myostatin is then segregated from the latent complex via proteolytic cleavage by BMP-1 and tolloid metalloproteinases. Free myostatin is able to bind its receptor, ActRIIB, and increase SMAD2/3 phosphorylation. The latter produces a heteromeric complex with SMAD4, inducing myostatin translocation into the cardiomyocyte nucleus to modulate transcription factor activity. Manipulating the muscle creatinine kinase promoter can modulate myostatin expression, although it has only been observed in male mice thus far.

Myostatin may inhibit cardiomyocyte proliferation and differentiation by manipulating cell cycle progression. This argument is supported by the fact that myostatin mRNA is poorly expressed in proliferating fetal cardiomyocytes. &quot;In vitro &quot;studies indicate that myostatin promotes SMAD2 phosphorylation to inhibit cardiomyocyte proliferation. Furthermore, myostatin has been shown to directly prevent cell cycle G1 to S phase transition by decreasing levels of cyclin-dependent kinase complex 2 (CDK2) and by increasing p21 levels.

Growth of cardiomyocytes may also be hindered by myostatin-regulated inhibition of protein kinase p38 and the serine-threonine protein kinase Akt, which typically promote cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. However, increased myostatin activity only occurs in response to specific stimuli, such as in pressure stress models, in which cardiac myostatin induces whole-body muscular atrophy.

Physiologically, minimal amounts of cardiac myostatin are secreted from the myocardium into serum, having a limited effect on muscle growth. However, increases in cardiac myostatin can increase its serum concentration, which may cause skeletal muscle atrophy. Pathological states that increase cardiac stress and promote heart failure can induce a rise in both cardiac myostatin mRNA and protein levels within the heart. In ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy, increased levels of myostatin mRNA have been detected within the left ventricle.

As a member of the TGF-β family, myostatin may play a role in post-infarct recovery. It has been hypothesized that hypertrophy of the heart induces an increase in myostatin as a negative feedback mechanism in an attempt to limit further myocyte growth. This process includes mitogen-activated protein kinases and binding of the MEF2 transcription factor within the promoter region of the myostatin gene. Increases in myostatin levels during chronic heart failure have been shown to cause cardiac cachexia. Systemic inhibition of cardiac myostatin with the JA-16 antibody maintains overall muscle weight in experimental models with pre-existing heart failure.

Myostatin also alters excitation-contraction (EC) coupling within the heart. A reduction in cardiac myostatin induces eccentric hypertrophy of the heart, and increases its sensitivity to beta-adrenergic stimuli by enhancing Ca2+ release from the SR during EC coupling. Also, phospholamban phosphorylation is increased in myostatin-knockout mice, leading to an increase in Ca2+ release into the cytosol during systole. Therefore, minimizing cardiac myostatin may improve cardiac output.

<doc id="748041" wikidata="Q2538049" url="?curid=748041" title="RTA Rapid Transit">
<text>RTA Rapid Transit (generally known as The Rapid) is a rapid transit and semi-metro system owned and operated by the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (GCRTA).

The system serves Cleveland and surrounding areas in Cuyahoga County. The system currently consists of four total service lines: one rapid transit rail line and three light rail lines.

== Rail lines ==
The four rail lines join at Tower City Center in downtown Cleveland, on the platform level of the former Cleveland Union Terminal.

Three rail lines share their tracks at Tri-C–Campus District and East 55th stations. This sharing of one route by light and heavy rail trains is quite unusual. The shared stations have connected platforms of two heights to accommodate the two kinds of trains. And the two types of trains both use the same maintenance facility since they both use the same track gauge and same source of power (overhead catenary).

=== Red Line ===

The Red Line, a heavy-rail route, runs in both directions on fully grade-separated rights-of-way built from 1955 to 1968. It serves Cleveland&#x27;s southwest suburbs, with its southwestern terminus at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. Heading northeast, the Red Line serves University Circle before heading to its northeastern terminus at the Louis Stokes Station at Windermere in East Cleveland.

=== Blue, Green, and Waterfront Lines ===

The Blue and Green light-rail lines (alternatively known as the RTA Shaker Rapid) were built from 1913 to 1936 as grade-separated lines closer to downtown and surface lines along street medians in the streetcar suburb of Shaker Heights.

The two lines part ways at Shaker Square, a historic mixed-use community in Cleveland proper, just west of the Shaker Heights border.
The Blue Line veers southeast along Van Aken Boulevard until reaching its terminus near the intersection of Warrensville Center Road and Chagrin Boulevard (U.S. Route 422 and State Route 8). The Green line continues due east along Shaker Boulevard (State Route 87) until reaching its terminus at the intersection of Green Road.


The Waterfront Line, opened in 1996, extends the Blue and Green Lines from Tower City north through The Flats. It then travels northeast along the shoreline of Lake Erie, servicing the local Amtrak station and terminates at the Lakefront Municipal lot. The Waterfront light rail line provides access from Tower City Center to the Flats, Cleveland Browns Stadium, the Great Lakes Science Center, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and Burke Lakefront Airport.

== Stations ==
The RTA Rapid Transit system consists of a total of 47 stations. The stations are fully or partially within the city limits of Cleveland, Shaker Heights, East Cleveland, and Brook Park.



&quot;Note: Euclid–East 120th Street station closed in 2015 and was replaced by Little Italy–University Circle station.&quot;

<doc id="748043" wikidata="Q44688" url="?curid=748043" title="Wolfgang Overath">
<text>Wolfgang Overath (; born 29 September 1943) is a former West German footballer. A true one-club man, Overath spent his entire professional career at 1. FC Köln. He represented his country three times in World Cup finals, culminating in 1974 with the 2–1 victory over the Netherlands on home soil. Primarily an attacking midfielder, Overath was known for his passing ability, technique and outstanding left foot.

== Career ==

An attacking midfielder, Overath started playing football at SSV Siegburg, but spent the majority of his career at 1. FC Köln, appearing 765 times between 1962 and 1977 and scoring 287 goals. He won the inaugural Bundesliga with 1. FC Köln in 1964, overall he appeared in the first 14 seasons of the newly formed top-flight, and the German Cup in 1968. At European club level he played 71 matches (11 goals) for 1. FC Köln. He currently holds the all-time appearances record of the club (549 official matches played).

In total he won 81 caps for the national side between 1963 and 1974, scoring 17 goals. As well as the World Cup victory in 1974, he was at the heart of the West German midfield when they reached the final in 1966 and achieved third place in 1970. Overath scored the only goal in the latter match, with many foreign journalists voting him Germany&#x27;s best player in Mexico.

Overath is one of only seven players (alongside his teammates Franz Beckenbauer, Jürgen Grabowski, Horst-Dieter Höttges, Sepp Maier, later compatriot Miroslav Klose, and Italian Franco Baresi) with World Cup medals for first, second and third place. A main rival in the national team for leading the midfield was the flamboyant Günter Netzer from Borussia Mönchengladbach, German Player of the year in 1972 and 73. However, German coach Helmut Schön preferred the more staid Overath. An injury forced Overath out of the side before the quarterfinals of the European Championships 1972 where Netzer became alongside Franz Beckenbauer and Gerd Müller one of the outstanding protagonists leading the side, considered still Germany&#x27;s best of all time, to victory in the final over the USSR. Overath soon regained his place ahead of Netzer, due to the latter&#x27;s now being injured. Netzer himself said that Overath &quot;was born to play for Germany&quot;.

In 2004, he was elected President of 1. FC Köln. He resigned on 13 November 2011.

==Style of play==
A technically gifted playmaker in the same vein as his friend and rival Günter Netzer, the left-footed Overath is considered by many as one of Germany&#x27;s finest players and one of the greatest midfielders of his generation. Although known as an attacking midfielder with excellent technique, passing skills and a powerful shot, Overath also had good defensive workrate.

==Personal life==
Overath has been married to his wife Karin for 57 years. They have three children: two sons and one adopted daughter. Also, he was named an honorary citizen of Siegburg in 2003. Overath was awarded the Egidius-Braun-Preis for his charity work. Overath is a devout Roman Catholic who prays daily.

<text>The Camões Prize (, ), named after Luís de Camões, is the most important prize for literature in the Portuguese language. It is awarded annually by the Portuguese &quot;Direção-Geral do Livro, dos Arquivos e das Biblioteca&quot; (National Book, Archive an Libraries Department) and the Brazilian &quot;Fundação Biblioteca Nacional&quot; (National Library Foundation) to the author of an outstanding oeuvre of work written in Portuguese. The monetary award is of , making it among the richest literary prizes in the world.

==History==
This award is considered the premier literary prize in the Portuguese-speaking world and is granted on the basis of the entirety of one&#x27;s work.

The Camões Prize is awarded annually, alternating between the two countries, and based on decision of a specially designated jury. The award consists of a cash amount resulting from the contributions from Brazil and Portugal, and is set annually by mutual agreement.

The Camões Prize was first introduced by the Additional Protocol to the Cultural Agreement between the Government of the Portuguese Republic and the Government of the Federal Republic of Brazil, dated 7 September 1966, which creates the Camões Prize, signed in Brasilia on 22 June 1988, and approved in Portugal by Decree No. 43/88 of 30 November 1988.

This Protocol was replaced by a new one between the Portuguese Republic and the Federative Republic of Brazil, signed in Lisbon on 17 April 1999, approved by Portugal through Decree 47/99 in the official gazette of 5 November 1999.

<doc id="748047" wikidata="Q7280316" url="?curid=748047" title="Radiant barrier">
<text>A radiant barrier is a type of building material that reflects thermal radiation and reduces heat transfer. Because thermal energy is also transferred by conduction and convection, in addition to radiation, radiant barriers are often supplemented with thermal insulation that slows down heat transfer by conduction or convection.

A radiant barrier reflects heat radiation (radiant heat), preventing transfer from one side of the barrier to another due to a reflective, low emittance surface. In building applications, this surface is typically a very thin, mirror-like aluminum foil. The foil may be coated for resistance to the elements or for abrasion resistance. The radiant barrier may be one or two sided. One sided radiant barrier may be attached to insulating materials, such as polyisocyanurate, rigid foam, bubble insulation, or oriented strand board (OSB). Reflective tape can be adhered to strips of radiant barrier to make it a contiguous vapor barrier or, alternatively, radiant barrier can be perforated for vapor transmittance.

==Reflectivity and emissivity==
All materials in existence give off, or emit, energy by thermal radiation as a result of their temperature. The amount of energy radiated depends on the surface temperature and a property called emissivity (also called &quot;emittance&quot;). Emissivity is expressed as a number between zero and one at a given wavelength. The higher the emissivity, the greater the emitted radiation at that wavelength. A related material property is reflectivity (also called &quot;reflectance&quot;). This is a measure of how much energy is reflected by a material at a given wavelength. Reflectivity is also expressed as a number between 0 and 1 (or a percentage between 0 and 100). At a given wavelength and angle of incidence the emissivity and reflectivity values sum to 1 by Kirchhoff&#x27;s law.

Radiant barrier materials must have low emissivity (usually 0.1 or less) at the wavelengths at which they are expected to function. For typical building materials, the wavelengths are in the mid- and long-infrared spectrum, in the range of 3-15 micrometres.

Radiant barriers may or may not exhibit high visual reflectivity. While reflectivity and emissivity must sum to 1 at a given wavelength, reflectivity at one set of wavelengths (visible) and emissivity at a different set of wavelengths (thermal) do not necessarily sum to 1. Therefore, it is possible to create visibly dark colored surfaces with low thermal emissivity.

To perform properly, radiant barriers need to face open space (e.g., air or vacuum) through which there would otherwise be radiation.

==History==
In 1860, the French scientist Jean Claude Eugene Peclet experimented with the insulating effect of high and low emissive metals facing air spaces. Peclet experimented with a wide variety of metals ranging from tin to cast iron, and came to the conclusion that neither the color nor the visual reflectance were significant determining factors in the materials’ performance. Peclet calculated the reduction in BTUs for high and low emissive surfaces facing into various air spaces, discovering the benefits of a radiant barrier in reducing the transfer of heat.

In 1925, two German businessmen Schmidt and Dykerhoff filed for patents on reflective surfaces for use as building insulation because recent improvements in technology allowed low emissivity aluminum foil to be commercially viable. This became the launching pad for radiant barrier and reflective insulation around the world, and within the next 15 years, millions of square feet of radiant barrier were installed in the US alone.
Within 30 years, radiant barrier was making a name for itself, and was included in projects at MIT, Princeton, and Frank Sinatra’s residence in Palm Springs, California.

==Applications==
===Space exploration===
For the Apollo program, NASA helped develop a thin aluminum foil that reflected 95% of the radiant heat. A metalized film was used to protect spacecraft, equipment, and astronauts from thermal radiation or to retain heat in the extreme temperature fluctuations of space. The aluminum was vacuum-coated to a thin film and applied to the base of the Apollo landing vehicles. It was also used in numerous other NASA projects like the James Webb Space Telescope and Skylab. In the vacuum of outer space, where temperatures can range from heat transfer is only by radiation, so a radiant barrier is much more effective than it is on earth, where 5% to 45% of the heat transfer can still occur via convection and conduction, even when an effective radiant barrier is deployed. Radiant barrier is a Space Foundation Certified Space Technology(TM). Radiant barrier was inducted into the Space Technology Hall of Fame in 1996.

===Textiles===
Since the 1970s, sheets of metalized polyester called space blankets have been commercially available as a means to prevent hypothermia and other cold weather injuries. Because of their durability and light weight, these blankets are popular for survival and first aid applications. Swarms of people can be seen draped in reflective metalized film after a marathon, especially where the temperatures are particularly cold, like during the annual New York City Marathon which takes place in the fall.

===Window treatments===
Window glass can be coated to achieve low emissivity or &quot;low-e&quot;. Some windows use laminate polyester film where at least one layer has been metalized using a process called sputtering. Sputtering occurs when a metal, most often aluminum, is vaporized and the polyester film is passed through it. This process can be adjusted to control the amount of metal that ultimately coats the surface of the film.

These metalized films are applied to one or more surfaces of the glass to resist the transfer of radiant heat, yet the films are so thin that they allow visible light to pass through. Since the thin coatings are fragile and can be damaged when exposed to air and moisture, manufacturers typically use multiple pane windows. While films are typically applied to the glass during manufacturing, some films may be available for homeowners to apply themselves. Homeowner-applied window films are typically expected to last 10–15 years.

==Construction==
===Roofs and attics===
When radiant solar energy strikes a roof, heating the roofing material (shingles, tiles or roofing sheets) and roof sheathing by conduction, it causes the underside of the roof surface and the roof framing to radiate heat downward through the roof space (attic / ceiling cavity) toward the attic floor / upper ceiling surface. When a radiant barrier is placed between the roofing material and the insulation on the attic floor, much of the heat radiated from the hot roof is reflected back toward the roof and the low emissivity of the underside of the radiant barrier means that very little radiant heat is emitted downwards. This makes the top surface of the insulation cooler than it would have been without a radiant barrier and thus reduces the amount of heat that moves through the insulation into the rooms below.

This is different from the &quot;cool roof&quot; strategy which reflects solar energy before it heats the roof, but both are a means of reducing radiant heat. According to a study by the Florida Solar Energy Center, a white tile or white metal cool roof can outperform a traditional black shingle roof with a radiant barrier in the attic, but the black shingle roof with a radiant barrier outperformed the red tile cool roof.

For installing a radiant barrier under a metal or tile roof, the radiant barrier (shiny side down) should NOT be applied directly over the roof sheathing, because high contact area reduces the efficacy of the metallic surface as low emitter. Vertical battens (aka firring strips) may be applied atop said sheathing; then OSB with a radiant barrier may be put atop the battens. The battens allow more air space than construction without battens. If an air space is not present or is too small, heat will conduct from the radiant barrier, into the substructure, resulting in unwanted IR shower on lower regions. Wood is a poor insulator and so it conducts heat from the radiant barrier to lower surfaces of said wood, where it, in turn, sheds heat by emitting IR radiation. According to the US Department of Energy, “Reflective insulation and radiant barrier products must have an air space adjacent to the reflective material to be effective.”

The most common application for a radiant barrier is as a facing for attics. For a traditional shingle/tile/iron roof, radiant barriers may be applied beneath the rafters or trusses and under the roof decking. This application method has the radiant barrier sheets draped beneath the trusses of rafters, creating a small air space above with the radiant barrier facing into the entire interior attic space below. Reflective foil laminate is a product commonly used as the radiant barrier sheet.

Another method of applying a radiant barrier to a roof in new construction is to use a radiant barrier that is pre-laminated to OSB panels or roof sheathing. Manufacturers of this installation method often tout the savings in labor costs in using a product that serves as roof decking and radiant barrier in one.

To apply a radiant barrier in an existing attic, it may be stapled to the underside of the roof rafters. This method offers the same benefits as the draped method in that dual air spaces are provided. However, it is essential that the vents be allowed to remain open to prevent moisture from being trapped in the attic. In general, it is preferred to have the radiant barrier applied SHINY SIDE DOWN to the underside of the roof with an air space facing down; thus dust won&#x27;t defeat it, as would be the case of a SHINY SIDE UP barrier.

The final method of installing a radiant barrier in an attic is to lay it over the top of the insulation on the attic floor. While this method can be more effective in the winter there are a few potential concerns with this application, which the US Department of Energy and the Reflective Insulation Manufacturers Association International feel the need to address. First, a breathable radiant barrier should always be used here. This is usually achieved by small perforations in the radiant barrier foil. The vapor transmission rate of the radiant barrier should be at least 5 perms, as measured with ASTM E96, and the moisture in the insulation should be checked before installation. Second, the product should meet the required flame spread, which includes ASTM E84 with the ASTM E2599 method. Lastly, this method allows for dust to accumulate over the top surface of the radiant barrier, potentially reducing the efficiency over time.

====Energy savings====
According to a 2010 study by the Building Envelope Research Program of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, homes with air-conditioning duct work in the attic in the hottest climate zones, such as in the US Deep South, could benefit the most from radiant barrier interventions, with annual utility bill savings up to $150, whereas homes in milder climates, e.g., Baltimore, could see savings about half those of their southern neighbors. On the other hand, if there are no ducts or air handlers in the attic, the annual savings could be even much less, from about $12 in Miami to $5 in Baltimore. Nevertheless, a radiant barrier may still help to improve comfort and to reduce the peak air-conditioning load.

====Shingle temperature====
One common misconception regarding radiant barrier is that the heat reflecting off the radiant barrier back to the roof has the potential to increase the roof temperature and possibly damage the shingles. Performance testing by Florida Solar Energy Center demonstrated that the increase in temperature at the hottest part of the day was no more than about 5 degrees F. In fact, this study showed that a radiant barrier has the potential to decrease the roof temperature once the sun goes down because it prevents heat loss or transfer, from the attic, through the roof. RIMA International wrote a technical paper on the subject which included statements collected from large roofing manufacturers, and none said that a radiant barrier would in any way affect the warranty of the shingles.

====Attic dust accumulation====
When laying a radiant barrier over the insulation on the attic floor, it is possible for dust to accumulate on the top side. Many factors like dust particle size, dust composition and the amount of ventilation in the attic affect how dust accumulates and thus the ultimate performance of a radiant barrier in an attic. A study by the Tennessee Valley Authority mechanically applied a small amount of dust over a radiant barrier and found no significant effect when testing for performance. However, TVA referenced a previous study which stated that it was possible for a radiant barrier to collect so much dust that its reflectivity could be decreased by nearly half.
It is not true that a double-sided radiant barrier on the attic floor is immune to the dust concern. The TVA study also tested a double-sided radiant barrier with black plastic draped on top to simulate heavy dust accumulation, as well as a single-sided radiant barrier with heavy kraft paper on the top. The test indicated that the radiant barrier was not performing, and the small air spaces created between the peaks of the insulation were not sufficient to block radiant heat.

===Walls===
Radiant barrier may be used as a vented skin around the exterior of a wall. Furring strips are applied to the sheathing to create a vented air space between the radiant barrier and the siding, and vents are used at the top and bottom to allow convective heat to rise naturally to the attic. If brick is being used on the exterior, then a vented air space may already be present, and furring strips are not necessary. Wrapping a house with radiant barrier can result in a 10% to 20% reduction in the tonnage air conditioning system requirement, and save both energy and construction costs.

===Floors===
Reflective foil, bubble foil insulations, and radiant barriers are noted for their ability to reflect unwanted solar radiation in hot climates, when applied properly. Reflective foils are fabricated from aluminum foils with a variety of backings such as roofing paper, craft paper, plastic film, polyethylene bubbles, or cardboard. Reflective bubble foil is basically a plastic bubble wrap sheet with a reflective foil layer and belongs to a class of insulation products known as radiant foils. Reflective bubble/foil insulations are primarily radiant barriers, and reflective insulation systems work by reducing radiant heat gain. To be effective, the reflective surface must face an air space; also, dust accumulation on the reflective surface will reduce its reflective capability. The radiant barrier should be installed in a manner to minimize dust accumulation on the reflective surface.

Radiant barriers are more effective in hot climates than in cooler/cold climates (especially when cooling air ducts are located in the attic). When the sun heats a roof, it&#x27;s primarily the sun&#x27;s radiant energy that makes the roof hot. Much of this heat travels by conduction through the roofing materials to the attic side of the roof. The hot roof material then radiates its gained heat energy onto the cooler attic surfaces, including the air ducts and the attic floor. A radiant barrier reduces the radiant heat transfer from the underside of the roof to the other surfaces in the attic. Some studies show that radiant barriers can reduce cooling costs 5% to 10% when used in a warm, sunny climate. The reduced heat gain may even allow for a smaller air conditioning system. In cool climates, however, it&#x27;s usually more cost-effective to install more thermal insulation than to add a radiant barrier.

Both the American Department of Energy (DOE, Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy Department) and the Ministry of Natural Resources (NRCAN) state that these systems are not recommended for cold or very cold climates.

===Canada===
Canada is considered to be a cold climate, so these products do not perform as promoted. Though they are often marketed as offering very high insulating values, there is no specific standard for radiant insulation products, so be wary of posted testimonials and manufacturers’ thermal performance claims. Research has shown that the insulation value of reflective bubble foil insulations and radiant barriers can vary from RSI 0 (R-0) to RSI 0.62 (R-3.5) per thickness of material. A study conducted by CMHC (Canada Mortgage &amp; Housing Corporation) on four homes in Paris, ON found that the performance of the bubble foil was similar to an uninsulated floor. It also performed a cost-benefit analysis, and the cost-benefit ratio was $12 to $13 per cubic metre RSI.

The effective insulating value depends on the number of adjacent dead air spaces, layers of foil and where they are installed. If the foil is laminated to rigid foam insulation, the total insulating value is obtained by adding the RSI of the foam insulation to the RSI of the dead air space and the foil. If there is no air space or clear bubble layer, the RSI value of the film is zero.

<text>Dicycloverine, also known as dicyclomine, sold under the brand name Bentyl among others, is a medication that is used to treat spasms of the intestines such as those that occur in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is taken by mouth or by injection into a muscle. While it has been used in baby colic and enterocolitis, evidence does not support these uses.
Common side effects include dry mouth, blurred vision, weakness, sleepiness, and lightheadedness. Serious side effects may include psychosis and breathing problems in babies. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe while use during breastfeeding is not recommended. How it works is not entirely clear.
Dicycloverine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1950. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 176th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
===Irritable bowel syndrome===

Dicycloverine is used to treat the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, specifically hypermotility, in adults. As of 2016, clinical guidelines recommended dicycloverine and other antispasmodics for IBS with diarrhea as a first line treatment.

===Anxiety===

Dicycloverine can also be helpful for the treatment of anxiety, but this is an off-label use.

==Contraindications==
This medicine should not be used for people who have an obstructive GI or urinary condition, severe ulcerative colitis, reflux, any unstable cardiac condition, glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, and anyone who is acutely bleeding.

It should not be given to children or infants with colic due to the risks of convulsions, difficult breathing, irritability, and restlessness, and there is little evidence to support the efficacy in such use in any case.

Dicycloverine is known to impair thinking and coordination.

The effect on the baby during pregnancy or breastfeeding is not well understood.

==Adverse effects==
Dicycloverine can cause a range of anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth, nausea, blurred vision, dizziness, confusion, severe constipation, stomach pain, heart palpitations, difficulty urinating, and seizures.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Dicycloverine is a selective muscarinic acetylcholine M1 receptor antagonist. It blocks the action of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors on smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal tract, relaxing the smooth muscle.

==History==
Dicycloverine was first synthesized chemically in the United States &quot;circa&quot; 1945 by scientists at William S. Merrell Company.

It was first marketed in 1952 for gastrointestinal disorders, including colic in infants. The INN name &quot;dicycloverine&quot; was recommended in 1959. It was included in the combination drug for morning sickness called Bendectin, along with doxylamine and vitamin B6 which was launched in the US in 1956; dicycloverine was removed from the formulation in 1976 after Merrell determined that it added no value. Bendectin became the subject of many lawsuits due to allegations that it had caused birth defects similar to thalidomide, which Merrell had also marketed in the US and Canada.

In the 1980s, several governments restricted its use in infants due to reports of convulsions, difficult breathing, irritability, and restlessness in infants given the drug.

In 1994, the US Federal Trade Commission ordered Marion Merrell Dow, which had acquired Rugby Darby—the only generic manufacturer of dicycloverine in the US—to promise to grant licenses to its intellectual property on the drug to any company that wanted it, based on antitrust concerns. The US market for the medication at that time was around $8 million; Dow had 60% of it and Rugby had 40%. The next year, Hoechst Marion Roussel, which by that time had acquired the business, granted a license to Endo Pharmaceuticals. By 2000 several other generic competitors had started selling the medication. The case was part of the reshaping of the US pharmaceutical market that occurred in the 1990s, to favor generic entry.

==Society and culture==
Rarely, there have been reports of dicycloverine abuse. Dicycloverine is an antagonist at σ1 and 5-HT2A receptor sites, though its affinities for these targets are roughly one-fifth to one-tenth as strong as its affinities for CHRM1 and CHRM4 (its clinical targets). It is also a relatively non-polar tertiary amine, able to cross the blood–brain barrier, leading to delirium at high concentrations.

<text>Little Joe 1 (LJ-1) was a failed launch of a Little Joe by NASA, a solid fuel rocket that was designed for a Max Q abort and launch escape system test for the Mercury capsule. The objective was to determine how well the escape rocket would function under the most severe dynamic loading conditions anticipated during a Mercury-Atlas launching.

The vehicle was in height, weighed approximately , and was in diameter with a fin span of . The Little Joe booster consisted of four Pollux and four Recruit clustered, solid-fuel rockets, could develop a thrust of , and could lift a maximum payload of . The escape system, using a Grand Central 1KS52000 rocket motor, weighed .

On 21 August 1959, LJ-1 was being prepared for launch from the Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, Virginia. At 35 minutes before launch, evacuation of the area had been proceeding on schedule and the batteries for the programmer and destruct system in the test booster were being charged. Suddenly, half an hour before launch time, an explosive flash occurred. When the smoke cleared it was evident that only the capsule-and-tower combination had been launched, on a trajectory similar to an off-the-pad abort. The booster and adapter-clamp ring remained intact on the launcher. Near apogee, at about 610 m, the clamping ring that held tower to capsule released and the little pyro-rocket for jettisoning the tower fired. The flight time was 20 seconds.

The accident report for LJ-1, issued 18 September 1959, blamed the premature firing of the Grand Central escape rocket on an electrical leak, or what missile engineers call transients or ghost voltages in a relay circuit. The fault was found in a coil designed to protect biological specimens from too rapid an abort.

According to the 18 September 1959 accident report, the unexpected triggering of the launch escape system was caused by a transient or electrical leak; analysis showed it to be due to the rapid-abort system being wired directly into the destruct arming busbar. The batteries were shipped from England to the U.S. uncharged and shorted; on charging at the pad, the batteries, when enough charge was reached, actuated the sequencer for the abort system, and sensing insufficient altitude, fired the squibs in the abort motor. Insufficient power in the batteries then failed to initiate the tower jettison motor and capsule parachute recovery charge, and both crashed into the sea.

<text>SECU Stadium is an outdoor athletic stadium on the campus of the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland. It is the home of Maryland Terrapins football and men&#x27;s lacrosse teams, which compete in the Big Ten Conference. The facility was formerly named Byrd Stadium after Harry &quot;Curley&quot; Byrd, a multi-sport athlete, football coach, and university president in the first half of the 20th century, and temporarily Maryland Stadium after objections to Byrd&#x27;s naming due to his history of supporting segregation.

==History==

SECU Stadium opened on September 30, 1950, as Byrd Stadium after construction at a cost of $1 million, replacing the much smaller Old Byrd Stadium on the site currently used for the university&#x27;s Fraternity Row east of Baltimore Avenue. For 26 seasons, Maryland Stadium consisted of a horseshoe-shaped bowl with capacity of 34,680.
Permanent lights were installed in 1985.

In 1991, the stadium added the five-story Tyser Tower on its south side, featuring luxury suites and an expanded press area. That same year, the university opened the Gossett Football Team House adjacent to the east endzone.

In 1995, the stadium&#x27;s capacity increased to 48,055 through the addition of a 12,000-seat upper deck on the north side of the stadium. In 2001, during the Terrapins&#x27; ACC championship run, bleachers were installed to add an additional 3,000 seats. In 2002, a full-color video scoreboard was added in the east endzone, and the Gossett Football Team House started an expansion project.

Between 2007 and 2009, the stadium underwent a $50.8 million expansion, increasing overall capacity, adding skyboxes and lowering the field to improve spectators&#x27; sightlines. The project rebuilt Tyser Tower, adding 63 suites and mezzanine seating. The expansion increased the stadium capacity to 54,000. A second LED video board was installed on the west side of the stadium before the 2008 season. The university had also announced plans to extend the upper deck around the west endzone, adding another 8,000 seats, but the expansion project was completed without this construction.

The university installed a new artificial playing surface field in 2012, replacing its natural grass field used since the stadium&#x27;s opening. The upgrade included a new technology known as &quot;CoolPlay&quot; that reportedly keeps the field cooler (up to 15 °F cooler) than traditional turf fields with rubber infill. It was the first installation of its kind in the United States.

In 2021, a larger videoboard was installed behind the west endzone. The screen was first used during a night game against Iowa on October 1, 2021.

SECU Stadium&#x27;s attendance record is 58,973, set on November 1, 1975. The record was achieved with temporary seating for a game featuring the #14 Terps and #9 Penn State.

The lone version of the Presidential Cup college football bowl game was held here in December 1950. The USFL Baltimore Stars called the stadium home in 1985. SECU Stadium has also hosted the Division I NCAA Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championship ten times.

==Field naming rights==
On August 24, 2006, the University of Maryland announced that it had agreed to a $20 million deal with Chevy Chase Bank to name the field Chevy Chase Bank Field, leaving the Byrd Stadium name intact. The revenue from the deal was used to pay for renovations and upgrades to the stadium.

After Chevy Chase Bank was acquired by Capital One in 2009, the field was renamed Capital One Field.

The bank branding is not displayed on the outside of the stadium, but since 2006 the full name including the branded field has been used in the university&#x27;s marketing materials for the stadium.

On September 16, 2022, the university announced that the stadium would be renamed SECU Stadium as part of a 10-year deal between the credit union and the university. The deal is worth $11 million and includes $2.5 million that will go towards athletic facility improvements.

==Stadium name change==
The stadium&#x27;s original namesake was Harry C. &quot;Curley&quot; Byrd, a former Maryland football player who later taught English and History and served as athletic director before rising to university president, serving from 1935 until 1954. During his tenure, the campus grew significantly, and Byrd is credited with transforming UMD from &quot;an undistinguished agricultural college to something resembling a modern university.&quot; However, in 2015, the Maryland Student Government Association passed resolution in support of removing Byrd&#x27;s name from the stadium because of his prominent support of segregation during his tenure. That same year, then-university president Wallace Loh appointed a task force to consider the issue. Loh issued a recommendation to the University System of Maryland to change the name, and the Board of Regents voted 12–5 in December 2015 to rename the facility as &quot;Maryland Stadium.&quot;
On September 16, 2022, the university announced that the stadium would be renamed SECU Stadium as part of a 10-year deal between the credit union and the university.

<text>Kyriaki Papadopoulou (; born 19 May 1938), known by her stage name Marinella (), is a Greek singer whose career has spanned several decades. She is well regarded due to her impressive vocal range. Since the beginning of her professional singing career in 1956, she has released 66 solo albums, and has also been featured on many albums by other musicians. She represented Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest 1974, becoming the first ever Greek entrant in the contest.

From 1956 to 2024, Marinella remained active for 68 years, performing in concerts and weekly shows at nightclubs. On September 25, 2024, at the age of 86, she suffered a severe hemorrhagic stroke while performing at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus in Athens, collapsing on stage. Since then, she has been hospitalized, showing minimal interaction with her environment.

==Early life==
Kyriaki Papadopoulou was born in the city of Thessaloniki in northern Greece. Her parents were Greek refugees from Constantinople. She is the fourth and last child of a large family, which despite its poverty, was rich in love and in artistic vein. The whole family gathered around the turntable and sang, while her father tried to teach children the steps of the waltz and the tango. From the age of four years singing on the radio broadcast in &quot;Pediki Ora &quot;(Children&#x27;s Hour)&quot;&quot; and later did ads for shops such as &quot;Melka&quot; in Thessaloniki, earning her first pocket money. She participated in many performances of children&#x27;s theatre.

At age 15, she gave up her budding career to finish school, but by seventeen, her passion for the theatre returned and she joined the artistic group of Mary Laurent, a &quot;mpoulouki&quot; (so called then the singer troupes that traveled Greece end-to-end for performances) and plays small roles. One day, the lead singer fell sick and sought Marinella as a replacement, who was willing to take the singer&#x27;s place. Marinella then became the lead singer of the troupe. Additionally, she later joined the Military Theatre because the remuneration was better. At the same time she started her career as a singer at the &quot;Panorama&quot; centre of Thessaloniki, where Greek actor and singer Tolis Harmas coined the name &quot;Marinella&quot; for her, inspired by his song.

She released her first song in 1957, &quot;Nitsa, Elenitsa &quot;(Little Helen)&quot;&quot;. Her early career was marked by her collaboration with singer Stelios Kazantzidis. Together they managed to become the greatest duet of Greece, unsurpassed even today. Starting at the night club &quot;Luxembourg&quot; in Thessaloniki where they enjoyed great success, they later moved to Athens, where they became widely known. They sang the songs of Mikis Theodorakis, Manos Hadjidakis, Vassilis Tsitsanis, Giorgos Mitsakis, Giorgos Zambetas, Apostolos Kaldaras, Theodoros Derveniotis, Stavros Xarchakos, Christos Leontis, whom are considered the best composers of the era.

Marinella married Stelios Kazantzidis on 7 May 1964 and they toured together in Germany and the United States. They divorced in September 1966. Marinella then began a solo career and eventually married singer Tolis Voskopoulos in 1974. This marriage also ended in divorce in 1981.

==Early career==
In October 1970, Marinella participated in the V Festival Internacional da Cançao Popular – Parte Internacion (FIC) in Rio de Janeiro, representing Greece with the song &quot;Kyra Giorgena &quot;(Wife of George)&quot;&quot;, finishing 4th among 38 countries. On October 24, 1970, the Billboard wrote &quot;Marinella from Greece, knows audiences in Athens clubs, carries enchantment in her songs and the warmth of the sun in her voice&quot; (by Henry Johnston).

Marinella was the first Greek singer to participate in the International MIDEM Festival of 1973 in Cannes with three new songs composed by Stavros Xarchakos. She also participated in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1974, placing eleventh with the song &quot;Krasi, thalassa kai t&#x27; agori mou&quot; (&quot;Wine, sea and my boyfriend&quot;). Initially Greek rock band Nostradamos had won the first Eurovision participation contest run by the state broadcaster ERT to represent Greece at Eurovision. However the band was not allowed to compete at Eurovision due to a scandal, and Marinella was sent instead.

She also performed in several Greek musicals, both as singer and actress. Her popularity rose in the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, with a string of successful albums and live shows. She developed a new standard for shows in the Greek night clubs, introducing costumes, dancing, and special lighting effects.

==Later career==

On 27 April 1998, Marinella performed in the Athens Concert Hall, performing her older hits to great acclaim. Her concert at the small Olympic Stadium of Athens on 1 October 1999 was a great success with more than 25,000 people.

In November 2002, she collaborated with George Dalaras. They performed concerts in Athens and Thessaloniki as well as abroad. The tour was titled &quot;Mazi &quot;(Together)&quot;&quot; and the released live album from these performances reached platinum status in 2003.On 10 April 2003, &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic wrote about Marinella, &quot;Her voice was earthy and strong, and she had the presence of an actress as she danced a few teasing steps or brought dignity to longing&quot; (by Jon Pareles).

In March 2004, she released a brand new album with new songs by Nikos Antypas and Lina Nikolakopoulou, entitled &quot;Ammos Itane &quot;(Sand it&#x27;s what it was)&quot;&quot;. In the same year, on 29 August, she performed at the closing ceremony of the 2004 Summer Olympics, along with Dimitra Galani, Haris Alexiou, Yiannis Parios and George Dalaras.

In December 2005, she released a new album titled &quot;Tipota Den Ginete Tihea &quot;(Νothing happens by chance)&quot;&quot;, composed by Giorgos Theofanous. The album reached gold status and includes duets with famous Greek singers, such as Antonis Remos and Glykeria.

In 2006, two new compilations of Marinella were officially released, the first titled &quot;Sti Skini &quot;(On stage)&quot;&quot; and containing older live recordings and the second one titled &quot;Ta Logia Ine Peritta – 50 Chronia Tragoudi &quot;(Words are pointless – 50 Years of song)&quot;&quot;, which is a complete eight CDs boxset with Marinella&#x27;s greatest hits from the beginning of her career until her collaboration with Kostas Hatzis at &quot;Recital&quot;. She returned to nightlife, by performing live with Antonis Remos at the Athens Arena in 2006–07 and 2007–08, with Giannis Parios at the Diogenis Studio in the winter season 2008–09, and with Natassa Theodoridou at the Votanikos in 2011–12, in Athens. 

== Health ==
On September 25, 2024, Marinella was set to perform at the iconic Odeon of Herodes Atticus in Athens. During the performance, audience members noticed that the 86-year-old singer appeared unwell, and she ultimately collapsed while singing her third song of the night. She was rushed to a private hospital, where she was diagnosed with a severe and widespread hemorrhagic stroke. Marinella spent 21 days in intensive care and remains hospitalized, showing minimal interaction with her environment.

==Appearances in film, theater and television==
===Film===
Marinella&#x27;s first appearance in the cinema was with Stelios Kazantzidis - the most popular artistic couple of the time - in the 1960 film &quot;I kyria dimarhos&quot; . In the film they sing two of their big hits of that time, &quot;Ziguala&quot; and &quot;Gia mas pote min ximerosei&quot;. In the film Marinella sings alone, the song &quot;Allaxane ta pragmata&quot; which was written especially for the film and relates to women&#x27;s empowerment which is one of the themes of this comedy.&lt;br&gt;
In 1962 she appears again with Kazantzidis in the melodramatic film &quot;Klapse ftohi mou kardia&quot; singing their hit &quot;Fevgo me pikra sta ksena&quot;. In 1965 the couple will sing in the film &quot;Oi adistaktoi&quot; , the song of Yannis Markopoulos &quot;Pios dromos ine anichtos&quot; in which the leading actor of the film, Nikos Kourkoulos, participates.&lt;br&gt;Kazantzidis and Marinella will appear together for the last time on screen in 1966, in Andreas Katsimitsoulias&#x27; film &quot;Angeloi tis amartias&quot; with the song &quot;Na fygo, na fygo&quot;.

Her big personal successes, however, would come in 1968 and 1969. In 1968 she would appear in two films with two songs that marked her career: in the comedy &quot;O pio kalos o mathitis&quot; &quot;&quot; she sang Giorgos Zampetas&#x27;s &quot;Stalia-stalia&quot; - which gave the title to her first solo album, and in the musical &quot;Gorgones kai magkes&quot; when she sang &quot;Anixe Petra&quot;, with music by Mimis Plessas and lyrics by Lefteris Papadopoulos. Her performance especially in this song launched her career and is still associated with her name to this day. &lt;br&gt; In 1969 she will also sing in two films three songs that will also become big hits: &quot;Pios in&#x27; aftos&quot; in the film &quot;O Blofatzis&quot; and &quot;Dos&#x27; mou t&#x27; athanato nero&quot; and &quot;Zografismena sto charti&quot; in &quot;I Pariziana&quot; &lt;br&gt; In total, she has appeared as a singer in 24 films.
==Theatre==
She appeared in the theatre in the summer of 1962 in the revue &quot;Omorfi Poli&quot; with music and songs by Mikis Theodorakis. The artistic couple Kazantzidis and Marinella were enlisted to boost the audience attendance, which was not as expected. 

In 2010 she will star in the theatrical performance &quot;Marinella - The musical&quot; a musical theatre performance that tells the story of her life. The musical, directed by Stamatis Fasoulis, became a great commercial and artistic success. 
==Television==
She participated in two television series by Kostas Koutsomytis. In 1995 she performed the title song and seven other songs in the drama series &quot;I prova tou nyfikou&quot; while 2000 played the role of Marika Suez, the patron of a theatrical troupe, in the series &quot;Ystera irthan oi melisses&quot;.

<text>The Transcendental Club was a group of New England authors, philosophers, socialists, politicians and intellectuals of the early-to-mid-19th century which gave rise to Transcendentalism. 

==Overview==
Frederic Henry Hedge, Ralph Waldo Emerson, George Ripley, and George Putnam (1807–1878; the Unitarian minister in Roxbury) met in Cambridge, Massachusetts on September 8, 1836, to discuss the formation of a new club; their first official meeting was held eleven days later at Ripley&#x27;s house in Boston. Other members of the club included Amos Bronson Alcott, Orestes Brownson, Theodore Parker, Henry David Thoreau, William Henry Channing, James Freeman Clarke, Christopher Pearse Cranch, Convers Francis, Sylvester Judd, Jones Very, and Charles Stearns Wheeler. Female members included Sophia Ripley, Margaret Fuller, Elizabeth Peabody, Ellen Sturgis Hooper, and Caroline Sturgis Tappan.
Originally, the group went by the name &quot;Hedge&#x27;s Club&quot; because it usually met when Hedge was visiting from Bangor, Maine. The name Transcendental Club was given to the group by the public and not by its participants. The name was coined in a January 1837 review of Emerson&#x27;s essay &quot;Nature&quot; and was intended disparagingly. James Elliot Cabot, a biographer of Emerson, wrote of the group as &quot;the occasional meetings of a changing body of liberal thinkers, agreeing in nothing but their liberality&quot;. Hedge wrote: &quot;There was no club in the strict sense... only occasional meetings of like-minded men and women&quot;. It was sometimes referred to by the nickname &quot;the brotherhood of the &#x27;Like-Minded&#x27;&quot;.

The club was a meeting-place for these young thinkers and an organizing ground for their idealist frustration with the general state of American culture and society at the time, and in particular, the state of intellectualism at Harvard University. Much of their thinking centered on the shortcomings of the Unitarian church.

Many well-known American journals, including the &quot;North American Review&quot; and the &quot;Christian Examiner&quot;, refused to accept submissions from the Transcendental Club for publication. One early review of Emerson&#x27;s poetry, for example, warned readers that his poems &quot;are not sacred chants; they are hymns to the devil. Not God, but Satan, do they praise, and they can be relished only by devil-worshippers&quot;. In October 1839, members of the Transcendental Club had the idea of establishing their own periodical as a platform for their ideals. Initially, Brownson suggested utilizing his &quot;Boston Quarterly Review&quot;, though others thought their own magazine was necessary. Hedge, Parker, and Emerson declined the role of editor. Ripley served as the managing editor and Fuller accepted the editor position on October 20, 1839, though she was unable to begin work on the publication until the first week of 1840. The first issue of &quot;The Dial&quot;, with an introduction by Emerson calling it a &quot;Journal in a new spirit&quot;, was published in July 1840. 

The Transcendental Club likely did not have official meetings after September 1840, though they continued to correspond and attend each other&#x27;s lectures. &quot;The Dial&quot; continued to be published, though it was never financially stable. In 1843, then business manager Elizabeth Peabody counted only two hundred subscribers and that its income was not covering production costs. It finally ceased publication in April 1844. Emerson&#x27;s speech/essay &quot;Nature&quot; has been considered a manifesto of Transcendentalist ideas.

<text>Theodore Amar Lyons (December 28, 1900 – July 25, 1986) was an American professional baseball starting pitcher, manager and coach in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played in 21 MLB seasons, all with the Chicago White Sox. He is the franchise leader in wins. Lyons won 20 or more games three times (in , , and ) and became a fan favorite in Chicago.

Lyons was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955. He has the fourth-highest career ERA among Hall of Fame pitchers, and is the only Hall of Fame pitcher to have more walks than strikeouts. In 1981 Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included Lyons in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;.

==Career==

===Playing career===

Lyons broke into the major leagues in after playing collegiate baseball at Baylor University. He joined the White Sox on a road trip and never pitched a day in the minors. Lyons recorded his first two wins as a relief pitcher in a doubleheader on October 6, 1923, making him one of the first pitchers to perform the feat. He worked his way into the starting rotation the following year, when he posted a 12–11 record and 4.87 ERA.

On August 21, , Lyons no-hit the Boston Red Sox 6–0 at Fenway Park; the game took just 1 hour and 45 minutes to complete (Ted Lyons August 21, 1926 No-hitter Box Score).

On May 24, 1929, Lyons threw a 21 inning complete game in a 6-5 loss to the Detroit Tigers. George Uhle, who was the winning pitcher, also pitched twenty innings to earn his eighth win of the season. The pair became the tenth pair of pitchers in baseball history to throw at least 20 innings in a game and only the 4th since the live-ball era began in 1920.

Lyons was at his crafty best in 1930, when he posted a 22–15 record and A.L.-leading totals of 29 complete games and innings for a team that finished 62–92. Prior to a 1931 arm injury, his pitches included a &quot;sailer&quot; (now known as a cut fastball), knuckleball, curveball, and changeup. After the 1931 injury, his pitches included a fastball, slow curve, knuckleball and an even slower curveball used as a changeup.

As Lyons aged, his career benefited from the White Sox&#x27; decision to never let him pitch more than 30 games per season from on. He was such a draw among the fans that, as his career began to wind down in , manager Jimmy Dykes began using him only in Sunday afternoon games, which earned him the nickname &quot;Sunday Teddy&quot;. Lyons made the most of his unusual scheduling, winning 52 of 82 decisions from 1939 until .

During 1942, Lyons&#x27;s 20th and last full season, he led the league with a 2.10 ERA and completed every one of his 20 starts. Although exempt from the military draft due to age, after the season he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and fought in the Pacific War. In 1943, the White Sox announced that Lyons&#x27;s jersey number would not be reissued. In May of that year, he was based in Chicago at the Navy Pier. He commented that he would not be able to return to pitching if the war lasted three or four more years.

Lyons made a brief return to the mound in 1946, with a 2.32 ERA in five games, all complete. He stopped pitching for good that season, having compiled a 260–230 record, 356 complete games, 1073 strikeouts and a 3.67 ERA. Lyons never appeared in a postseason game, as the generally mediocre-to-poor White Sox were usually far behind the American League leaders during his career. In Lyons&#x27;s 21 seasons with the Sox, they finished fifth or lower (in an eight-team league) 16 times, and never finished higher than third. New York Yankees manager Joe McCarthy said, &quot;If (Lyons had) pitched for the Yankees, he would have won over 400 games.&quot;

Lyons was a better than average hitting pitcher in his 21-year major league career, posting a .233 batting average (364-for-1563) with 162 runs, 49 doubles, 9 triples, 5 home runs, 149 RBI and 73 bases on balls. He was used as a pinch hitter 45 times. Defensively, he recorded a .958 fielding percentage which was only a couple of points higher than the league average at his position.

===Managing and coaching career===
In May , six days after what would be his last game as a pitcher, Lyons took over as manager of the White Sox after an apparent contract dispute between Dykes and Grace Comiskey. He had less success as a manager than he had as a player, guiding them to a meager 185–245 record. Lyons resigned as manager in October 1948.

Lyons coached the pitchers for the Detroit Tigers (1949–1953) and Brooklyn Dodgers ().

====Managerial record====
==Later life==
In 1955, he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Lyons served as a scout with the White Sox until his retirement in 1967. Apart from his wartime service and his stints as a coach with the Tigers and Dodgers, he spent over 40 years on the White Sox payroll. Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included Lyons in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot; (1981).

On July 25, 1986, Lyons died in a nursing home in Sulphur, Louisiana. One year later, the White Sox retired his uniform number, #16.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Lyons as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Marine Corps during World War II.

<doc id="748131" wikidata="Q3513559" url="?curid=748131" title="Tabula Rasa (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)">
<text>&quot;Tabula Rasa&quot; is the eighth episode of season 6 of the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. The episode aired on November 13, 2001 on UPN. It explores the characters not as they are, but as they could be, after they lose their memory to a spell gone awry.

== Plot ==
Spike confronts Buffy about their sudden passionate kiss the previous night and she tells him it will never happen again, then defends him from an attack by a demon loan shark (in a visual pun, he is a demon with a shark&#x27;s head, named &quot;Teeth&quot;). Willow, Xander, Anya and Tara discuss their discovery that they called Buffy back from Heaven, not Hell. Willow suggests fixing the mess with a spell and Tara confronts her about her excessive use of magic. At the threat of losing Tara, a desperate Willow pledges to go a week without magic.

At the Magic Box, Giles tells Buffy he is leaving for England so she can learn to stand on her own and Buffy takes the news very badly. With the gang on the way to the Magic Box for a meeting with Giles, Willow hangs back and begins another spell in the fireplace, using a crystal and some Lethe&#x27;s Bramble (the forgetting herb) that will make Tara and Buffy forget their troubles. Pocketing the crystal, in her rush, she accidentally leaves a full bag of the herb on the hearth.

At the shop, Giles informs the Scoobies, including a disguised Spike (in a tweedy suit) on the run from the loan shark, that he is leaving, and Buffy tearfully reveals that she feels deserted by everyone. Back at the Summers&#x27; house, a spark from the fireplace sets the entire bag of Lethe&#x27;s Bramble on fire, causing the whole gang to fall unconscious. They wake up that evening with no knowledge of who they are. Spike suspects Giles is his father (because they are both British and Giles feels a gut-wrenching disappointment towards him), Anya assumes she is marrying Giles (because she is wearing an engagement ring and they jointly own the magic shop) and Willow and Xander think they are a couple (because they woke up next to each other and Willow is wearing his jacket). Giles, Anya, Xander, Willow and Tara figure out their names from their IDs and Dawn&#x27;s from her necklace. Spike assumes his name is &quot;Randy&quot; because of the label inside his coat, and Buffy, with no evidence to her identity, names herself &quot;Joan&quot;.

A pair of the loan shark&#x27;s vampire henchmen attack the shop, looking for Spike, and frighten the gang. Buffy discovers she has super strength when she stakes one of the vampires and saves Spike. Anya and Giles remain at the magic shop to work on spells, while Buffy and Spike head outside to fight more vampires and the rest of the Scoobies retreat to the sewers in an attempt to get to a hospital. Unfortunately, they are menaced by a vampire, too. When attacked, Spike unknowingly assumes his vampire visage, which sends Buffy running away in fear. When he catches up with her, Buffy attacks him and informs him that he is a vampire. He is confused, but assumes he is a good vampire because he does not want to hurt her. The loan shark and his minions attack the two and a fight ensues.

Back in the shop, Anya tries spells from a book and conjures numerous bunnies, frightening her and exasperating Giles. Giles and Anya fight while hiding behind the counter and Giles reveals that he found a one-way plane ticket in his pocket for London, assuming he must be abandoning Anya. Anya begs him not to leave her and they kiss passionately. In the sewer, Xander fights with the vampire chasing them and finally stakes it, but then accidentally steps on Willow&#x27;s crystal, which fell from her pocket during the commotion. The crystal shatters and the spell is broken, finding Giles and Anya kissing, Willow atop Tara after a fall, and Spike and Buffy deep in mid-action conversation. Tara and the others in the sewer realize that Willow broke her promise not to use magic. With the spell broken and her memories rushing back, Buffy is momentarily too stunned to duck a few painful hits. Spike finishes off the rest of the vampires and promises to make up his debt to the intimidated loan shark.

Back at the house, Tara packs her belongings and leaves as Willow cries in another room. Giles takes his plane back to England. Spike finds Buffy at The Bronze, but she turns her face away and he stalks off. Later, however, she follows him and they kiss passionately beneath the stairs.

==Themes==
StrangeAssembly.com notes that &quot;the heart of the episode is the breakdown of the relationship between Willow and Tara ... perhaps we all forgave Willow a little too easily for what is essentially an extreme form of emotional abuse and gaslighting.&quot; Theresa Basile, in a series about consent issues in &quot;Buffy&quot;, says,

==Cultural references==
*The website Women at Warp compares the group amnesia in &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot; with the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Conundrum.&quot; &quot;The &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew awakens after being scanned by an alien ship to discover they have no idea who they are. They have, however, retained their unique knowledge and skill sets. In Sunnydale, the gang wakes up to the same situation. Buffy doesn&#x27;t know her name, but she still knows how to fight. Hijinks ensue all around, particularly romantic ones. The main difference lies in what causes the amnesia. For the &quot;TNG&quot; crew, an outsider hijacks their memories. The Scoobies&#x27; was caused by one of their own: Willow casting a spell.&quot;

==Reception==

Reviewer Mark Oshiro writes, 
Reviewer Billie Doux rates the episode four stakes out of four and calls it &quot;wonderful, very clever, very funny.&quot;

<text>Katherine Virginia &quot;Kassie&quot; DePaiva (née Wesley; born March 21, 1961) is an American actress and singer. She is best known for playing the roles of Chelsea Reardon on the CBS soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot; (1986 to 1991), Blair Cramer on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (1993 to 2013), and Eve Donovan on the NBC soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; (2014 to 2020, 2023). She received one Daytime Emmy Award nomination for her role on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and two nominations for her role on &quot;Days Of Our Lives&quot;. DePaiva also starred as Bobby Joe in the horror film &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; (1986). As a singer, she has released three albums, &quot;Naked&quot; (2000), &quot;No Regrets&quot; (2005), and &quot;I Want to Love You&quot; (2007).

==Early life==
DePaiva was born and raised in Morganfield, Kentucky. Her birth name is Katherine Virginia Wesley. She was named after two of her aunts. Her father was a lawyer who practiced all types of law because of the small town they lived in. DePaiva has two older brothers and one younger sister.

In her childhood and teens, she sang in the church choir, participated in school plays, and she was involved in class government. She was voted Most Talented in her high school class. After high school, DePaiva attended Indiana University Bloomington and worked at Opryland USA in Nashville, Tennessee. She made her professional singing debut at the Grand Ole Opry when she was eighteen years old, singing two songs. She then decided to transfer to University of California, Los Angeles to study theater.

==Career==
===1979-1993: Early work===
While attending UCLA, DePaiva landed her first acting job in a television commercial for Wendy&#x27;s. She joined a four-part harmony band called Newport. The group performed in the Los Angeles, San Diego, and Las Vegas areas. She dropped out of college to travel with Newport on a USO tour of Japan, Korea, and Okinawa. After returning to the United States, DePaiva became a back up singer for Bobby Womack. She joined him on two U.S. tours and one tour of Great Britain.

Returning to acting, DePaiva (then using her maiden name of Wesley) landed the role of Bobby Joe in &quot;Evil Dead II&quot;. She then joined the cast of the CBS soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot; as Chelsea Reardon, first airing in November 1986. The character was a singer, giving DePaiva the opportunity to perform regularly on the show. After four years, she decided to leave due to lack of storyline, last airing in January 1991.

After leaving &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, she guest starred in episodes of &quot;Time Trax&quot;, &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, and &quot;Baywatch&quot;. An avid golfer, DePaiva hosted &quot;The Pro Shop&quot;, a syndicated series about the sport.

===1993-2006: &quot;One Life to Live&quot;===
DePaiva was cast as Blair Cramer on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live,&quot; first airing December 17, 1993. The role had previously been played by Mia Korf, an Asian-American actress. She received a Soap Opera Digest Award nomination for Hottest Actress in 1998 for her role on &quot;OLTL&quot;.

In 2000, DePaiva released her debut album, &quot;Naked&quot;. She described the music as being very raw and female-oriented. On February 14, 2002, she and her husband, James DePaiva, starred on stage in A. R. Gurney&#x27;s &quot;Love Letters&quot; at Jersey Central Theatre. In 2005, she released her second album, &quot;No Regrets&quot;, a collection of pop country songs. She also performed a duet with Jim Brickman on his album, &quot;The Disney Songbook&quot;, singing &quot;Baby Mine&quot; from &quot;Dumbo&quot;.

In March 2005, DePaiva received her first Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her role on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. She co-starred with Jack Scalia in the short film &quot;Exit&quot;, written and directed by Jamie Duneier. She starred in and produced the film &quot;Undone&quot; (2006), which was directed by her husband, James DePaiva. The film co-starred Heather Tom, Timothy D. Stickney, Forbes March, and Ricky Paull Goldin.

In 2006, DePaiva performed the song &quot;Simply Love&quot; on &quot;One Life: Many Voices for Hurricane Relief&quot;, an album of songs by &quot;One Life to Live&quot; actors to raise funds for victims of Hurricane Katrina. She sang &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot; on &quot;A Holiday Affair&quot;, an album of classic holiday songs performed by actors from ABC soap operas. She also performed with the ensemble on the closing track, &quot;We Wish You a Merry Christmas.&quot; The album was promoted with a Soapnet special, &quot;A Very Soapy Christmas&quot;.

===2007-2016: &quot;OLTL&quot; and &quot;Days&quot;===
DePaiva released her third album, &quot;I Want to Love You&quot;, in 2007. She described the album as being more unplugged and bluegrass than her earlier recordings. In 2009, she co-starred with her husband, James DePaiva, in a Time Life infomercial for a CD box set, &quot;The Power of Love&quot;.

DePaiva played Blair Cramer on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; until the final episode aired on ABC in January 2012. That same year, she also made several guest appearances as Blair on the ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;. She then played the role in an online revival of &quot;OLTL&quot; for several months in 2013. DePaiva played Emma Parker in the thriller film &quot;We Are What We Are&quot; in 2013. She co-starred with Julia Garner and Ambyr Childers. In May 2013, she co-starred with her husband, James DePaiva, in the musical &quot;110 in the Shade&quot; at the Community School of Naples.

In January 2014, &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; announced that DePaiva had joined the cast of the NBC soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; as Eve Donovan. The role had previously been played by Charlotte Ross, who left the show in 1991. DePaiva&#x27;s first airdate was June 18, 2014. In September 2015, DePaiva announced that she would be leaving &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. Her final airdate was February 2, 2016. She received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in 2016 for her role on &quot;Days&quot;. DePaiva made a return appearance to &quot;Days&quot;, airing on December 9, 2016.

=== 2016-present ===
In 2016, DePaiva made a guest appearance on &quot;Castle&quot;, alongside her former &quot;One Life to Live&quot; co-stars Tuc Watkins and Darlene Vogel. She had worked with the star of the series, Nathan Fillion, when he was a cast member on &quot;OLTL&quot; in the 1990s.

She returned to &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; as Eve Donovan, first airing on October 27, 2017. She briefly left the show in October 2018 and returned in December of that year. She once again left the show in December 2019. DePaiva received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in 2019 for her role on &quot;Days&quot;. She returned to the show for a few months in 2020.

She appeared in the film Killian &amp; the Comeback Kids in 2020, playing the wife of Nathan Purdee, her former &quot;One Life to Live&quot; co-star. The film was completed in 2018. She co-starred with Wally Kurth in the short film &quot;Common as Red Hair&quot; in 2022. DePaiva made return appearances to &quot;General Hospital&quot; as Blair Cramer and &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; as Eve Donovan in 2023.

==Personal life==
In the 1980s, she dated Sam Raimi, who directed her in &quot;Evil Dead II&quot;. He moved to New York with her in 1986, when she was cast on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, and they lived together for four months.

She married Richard C. Hankins, &quot;Guiding Light&quot;&#x27;s art director, on September 10, 1988. They divorced in 1995.

DePaiva (then known by her maiden name, Kassie Wesley), first met James DePaiva in the late 1980s at the Whaler Bar in New York, where she was singing. They didn&#x27;t see each other again until 1993, when she was cast as his love interest, Blair Cramer, on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. They were married on May 31, 1996, at the courthouse in her hometown, Morganfield, Kentucky. Kassie has said that she scheduled her wedding in between a dentist appointment and a golf game. They had a more formal ceremony in June 1996 at their home in the Catskills. The second wedding included James&#x27; daughter from his previous marriage, who was four years old at the time.

The DePaivas have one child together, son James Quentin (J. Q.) DePaiva, who was born on May 12, 1997. When he was twelve months old, they learned that he had been born with an enlarged vestibular aqueduct, an inner-ear abnormality causing him to be completely deaf. He received his first cochlear implant at eighteen months old and his second at eight years old. In 2007, J.Q. had a recurring role on &quot;All My Children&quot; as Jason. His character appeared on Erica Kane&#x27;s talk show to help her daughter, Kendall, deal with the hearing loss of her son, Spike.

DePaiva is a board member and fund raiser for the League for the Hard of Hearing, a non profit that aids deaf people and their families. She has crocheted a line of hats, called &quot;Happy Hats&quot;, and sold them online, donating the profits to deaf charities. She has also lobbied congress to make hearing tests mandatory for newborns in all fifty states.

In August 2016, DePaiva announced that she had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia the month prior. In September 2023, she announced that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer a year after beginning treatment for leukemia. She is now cancer free.

<doc id="748162" wikidata="Q5282306" url="?curid=748162" title="Disk editor">
<text>A disk editor is a computer program that allows its user to read, edit, and write raw data (at character or hexadecimal, byte-levels) on disk drives (e.g., hard disks, USB flash disks or removable media such as a floppy disks); as such, they are sometimes called &quot;sector editors,&quot; since the read/write routines built into the electronics of most disk drives require to read/write data in chunks of sectors (usually 512 bytes). Many disk editors can also be used to edit the contents of a running computer&#x27;s memory or a disk image.

Unlike &quot;hex editors,&quot; which are used to edit files, a disk editor allows access to the underlying disk structures, such as the master boot record (MBR) or GUID Partition Table (GPT), file system, and directories. On some operating systems (like Unix or Unix-like) most hex editors can act as disk editors just opening block devices instead of regular files. Programmers can use disk editors to understand these structures and test whether their implementation (e.g. of a file system) works correctly. Sometimes these structures are edited in order to provide examples for teaching data recovery and forensics, or in an attempt to hide data to achieve privacy or hide data from casual examiners. However, modifying such data structures gives only a weak level of protection and data encryption is the preferred method to achieve privacy.

Some disk editors include special functions which enable more comfortable ways to edit and fix file systems or other disk specific data structures. Furthermore, some include simple file browsers that can present the disk contents for partially corrupted file systems or file systems unknown to the operating system. These features can be used for example for file recovery.

==History==
Disk editors for home computers of the 1980s were often included as part of utility software packages on floppies or cartridges. The latter had the advantage of being instantly available at power-on and after resets, instead of having to be loaded or reloaded on the same disk drive that later would hold the floppy to be edited (the majority of home computer users possessed only one floppy disk drive at that time). Having the disk editor on cartridge also helped the user avoid editing/damaging the disk editor application disk by mistake.

All 1980s disk editors strove to be better than codice_1 contained in DOS. codice_2 could load, edit, and write one or more sectors from a floppy or hard disk based on the BIOS. This permitted simple disk editing tasks such as saving and restoring the master boot record and other critical sectors, or even changing the active (= boot) partition in the MBR.

In an NTVDM under 1993&#x27;s Windows NT codice_2 could not access the physical drive with the MBR of the operating system and so was in essence useless as disk editor for the system drive. The Resource Kit and the support tools for some Windows NT versions contained codice_4 as a very simple disk editor supporting the use and modification of the partition table in the MBR and related tasks.

==Partition editor==

A partition editor (also called partitioning utility) is a kind of utility software designed to view, create, modify or delete disk partitions. A disk partition is a logical segment of the storage space on a storage device. By partitioning a large device into several partitions, it is possible to isolate various types of data from one another, and allow the coexistence of two or more operating systems simultaneously. Features and capabilities of partition editors vary, but generally they can create several partition on a disk, or one contiguous partition on several disks, at the discretion of the user. They can also, shrink a partition to allow more partitions created on a storage device, or delete one and expand an adjacent partition into the available space.

<doc id="748175" wikidata="Q7429179" url="?curid=748175" title="Sayed Nabi Siddiqui">
<text>Sayed Nabi Siddiqui is an Afghan police officer who alleges that in August 2003 he was stripped naked by U.S.-led coalition forces, and beaten and photographed at a U.S. base in the city of Gardez in the Afghan province of Paktia. Siddiqui also alleged he was subjected to sexual abuse, taunting and sleep deprivation. On May 12, 2004, the U.S. military announced it had opened an investigation into the allegations.

Siddiqui was detained on July 15, 2003, after he reported police corruption and someone then accused him of being a member of the Taliban. He alleges he was held for about 40 days at three different U.S. bases: Gardez, Kandahar and Bagram.

Siddiqui&#x27;s is one of 44 complaints submitted to the United Nations by Ahmed Zia Langari, a member of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission.

Siddiqui told the &quot;New York Times&quot; that in Kandahar, detainees were packed into wire cages and forced to use a bucket as a toilet in front of other detainees. He also said soldiers threw stones and bottles at detainees.
